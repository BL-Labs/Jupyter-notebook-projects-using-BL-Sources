The Adam of Artillery. \u2014 Gunnery, however (and gunnery is inseparable from Woolwich), dates many generations earlier. There was a Master-Gunner of England at Calais in 1347, t and gunpowder, we are told, was first used in warfare at the Battle of Crecy only one year earlier, but there does not appear to have been any Regiment of Artillery for centuries thereafter. The Term \" Ordnance.\" \u2014 It remained a fractional and indistinct ingredient of the land forces, its chief gunners being styled \" Officers of Thor-dinances,\" after Thor, son of Odin, god of war, and their coat of-arms and motto appear on the next page. + Woolwich was regarded as only naval by the old historian Stow, whose survey of 1598 mentions its \" dock, and store-houses, and navy royal,\" but says nothing of its military attributes. The early chronicles of the Royal Arsenal may be invoked to supply the chrysalis from which the Royal Regiment of Artillery sprang, but I leave to abler hands and fuller treatises the task of revealing the primordial germ, and begin with the first Woolwich Gunner of whom I find an authentic voucher. This is Captain Richard Leake, who lived at Woolwich Tower-place for a good many years, and died there * See page 270. Prior to this date, however, recruits had been raised and soldiers occasionally quartered here. t This patriarch, says Capt. Murdoch, E.A., must have been the very Adam of the Corps.\u2014 (R.A.

The charge for a falcon was 2\\ lbs. of \"corn \" powder, and the range from 260 to 1,200 paces. Each gun was drawn by three horses or two yoke of oxen. There was one gunner and one matross t to each piece of ordnance, and these received double pay on service, but the guns were conveyed and worked by the \" grenadiers \"J of the several regiments to which they were attached. \u00a7 In the same year, another train was formed of two 12-prs., 4 demi-culverins (llf-prs.), four 6-prs., two sakers (5|-prs.), and two minions, all being of brass, and there were two gunners The Royal Artillery Arms in 1574. From a wall in the Tower of London. and two matrosses to each gun. None of these guns bad a range over 1,800 paces. The matrosses were regarded as soldiers next in rank below the gunners, and they carried firelocks or pikes aud hangers. At the Battle of Sedgemoor the Ring's guns were with great difficultv brought into action, owing to the defective appointments, but the Bishop of Winchester lent his coach-horses and harness, and the guns were got into range with good effect. The King thereupon resolved to * See Royal Arsenal, page 316. t Matross : military labourer grLto?11\"111618 : fr\u00b0m \u00a7renade'an \u00abPlosive ball or shell.

Borgard was by birth a Dane, but entered the English service in 1692 at the age of thirty-three, was at Woolwich during most of his home service, and did soldier's duty until he died, at the age of ninety-two, in 1751. On his appointment to the Royal Artillery, he flung himself with ardour into the profession of gunnery. He lived among his men An Early Breechloader. in the Warren, where their barracks (now officers' quarters) was built in 1719, and devoted himself to their instruction. To him, indeed, may be ascribed the first organization of an artillery corps. He held the rank of colonel, and when the regiment was on a war footing he was assisted by a major, a captain, three lieutenants, and two surgeons. There were in the ranks seven non-commissioned officers, twenty gunners, forty matrosses, two drummers, and ten artificers, besides u b 2"], [28, "384 EECOEDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. engineers, conductors, drivers, and clerks. Ten watermen and a coxswain were also included in the train. Borgard's Diary. \u2014 General Borgard's diary, which is preserved in M.S. at the Royal Artillery Institution, is the record of a career of which artillerymen of all generations may be proud. In 1727 the regiment was increased to four companies, two of which were at Woolwich, one at Gibraltar, and one split up into detachments in Scotland and elsewhere. There were further augmentations up to 1741,* when it became necessary to establish a special school of officers, and the Royal Military Academy was founded. General Borgard's hand is seen in all these changes, and in his office at Woolwich every detail was worked out. Some of the orders of Generals Borgard and Belson, dated from the barracks in the Warren, between 1710 and 1757, may be selected: \u2014 The corporals and bombardiers are not to drink with the private men, If any non-commissioned officer or gunner make himself unfit for the King's duty by drinking, or any other bad practice, he shall be sent to the hospital at London for cure, and discharged out of the regiment. No man to go out a-shooting on any account whatever. None ofthe people to go three miles out of quarters without a passport. Neither non-commissioned officers, cadets, or private men to go a-shooting either in the Warren or country without leave of their officer. The sergeants and corporals to go round to all the public-houses in the town and acquaint them that it is the General's orders that they trust none of the Train people on any account whatever. None of the men to carry their victuals from the bakers or any other weight on their regimental hats. None of the officers to turn any of their horses out to graze in the Warren. Immediately after the roll is called the orderly corporals to go into the town and round their men's quarters, those in private lodgings as well as those in public houses, and make a report to the officer of the guard of those who are absent. The orderly men are then to go to their rooms and the sergeant of the guard to lock both barrack doors and bring the keys to his officer, who is to send the sergeant to open the doors at reveille beating in the morning. All non-commissioned officers and men who do not parade for church to be stopped a day's pay. The captains to see that their companies march strong, and in as good order as possible, on Tuesday morning at seven o'clock, in order to their bein| reviewed on Wednesday by the King.

The Repository. \u2014 In 1805-6, the upper road to London by way of Little Heath was formed, and the part of Hanging Wood to the east of it was converted into tbe Royal Military Repository, under tbe ingenious Sir William Congreve, who was appointed its \" Founder.\" He was an energetic and able artilleryman, but most of tbe inventions which bear the family name were produced afterwards by his equally clever son, who, although he also had charge of tbe Repository, was not in tbe Army. General Pattison. \u2014 The name of General James Pattison stands out conspicuously at tbis period. His father, who owned the Burrage estate at Plumstead, was a London merchant. James Pattison married a daughter of Albert Borgard, and bad a most distinguished career, which is set forth in more detail elsewhere, and must, together with the war services of tbe regiment at tbe end of tbe last century and tbe early part of the present, be here passed over. Old Mess-rooms. \u2014 It may just be mentioned, as a local circumstance, that at tbe end of the great wars with America, France, and Spain, a large party of artillery officers assembled at tbe Bull Hotel, Shooters' Hill, to welcome General Williams and those who bad served witb him at tbe Siege of Gibraltar. Mess-rooms in Barracks. \u2014 Tbe dinner to Gen. Williams was in November, 1783, and at that time tbe officers' mess-room in tbe barracks * The Bull Hotel had a large assembly-room, &c. (See \" Shooters' Hill \") ., + j? August 1776; some of the officers were still quartered in the Warren, and tbe Universal Magazine published some verses entitled \" Venus Equalled \" all in praise of the beauty and graces of a Miss Anne W-U-nis, whom Jove and Venus were supposed to have quarrelled about.\" Venus had declared that Jove could not find her own equal m mortal woman :\u2014 \" But, alas !

It was afterwards converted into tbe Barrack Church, and is now tbe Royal Artillery Theatre and Recreation Rooms. The present mess-room was substituted in 1802, when tbe western section of the barracks was finished. Before they had a mess-room in barracks, tbe officers bad usually messed at two taverns in Woolwich, known jocularly as the Bastion and the Redan. One of these was the Royal Mortar, being just outside their quarters in tbe Warren. Tbe other was either tbe Barrack Tavern, King's Arms, or Abercrombie, each of which is men tioned in the records of the mess. Commissions. \u2014 In 1693, bombardiers were commissioned officers, and, indeed, every man who served in the Artillery, even tbe privates, received a commission signed by tbe Master-General of the Ordnance. Officers' commissions were first signed by the King in 1751, and all other commissions were then discontinued.* General Belford. \u2014 General Belford, who died at his quarters in the Warren in 1780 at tbe age of seventy years, was finally prostrated by bis exertions to defend the Arsenal and tbe Convict Establishment from the riotous mobs of tbe period, who threatened to burn tbe Warren, release the prisoners, and destroy the national ordnance. His preparations would, we are assured, have rendered bis post secure against 40,000 men. General Brome. \u2014 General Joseph Brome, who was three times Commandant of Woolwich garrison, began his career as a drummer in tbe Royal Artillery about 1726, and died on the 24th of April, 1796, aged eighty-four years. Browne, in \" England's Artillerymen,\" tells tbe following anecdote : \u2014 Brome was a very small man, very reserved, and strict as to duty. On one occasion, when he was entering the Warren, the guard turned out, and the drummer heat two ruffles so badly that little Brome ran up to him, snatched away the drum, and, passing the belt over his own shoulders, began to beat away in good style, finishing with the couple of ruffles, and exclaiming, \" There, you young dog ! that's the way I used to beat when I was a drummer ! \" A Change. \u2014 So lately as 1798, field-guns appearing at a Wool wich review were drawn by borses in single file, and driven by plough men on foot, wearing smock-frocks, and armed with long whips. A * The recruiting sergeants, however, found flattery and compliments such strong allies that the term \" Gentleman of the Royal Artillery \" was applied to the lowest ranks for many years after. The following advertisement appeared in 1779 :\u2014 \"Whereas, his Majesty has been graciously pleased to give all gallant young men an opportunity of signalizing themselves by augmenting his Royal Regiment of Artillery\u2014 This is to give notice to all spirited young fellows of good character, 5 feet 6i inches high, that upon applying to the adjutant at Woolwich, they will be received\" into present pay, and shall all receive new cloathes, arms, and accoutre ments proper for a Gentleman of Royal Artillery.\""], [34, "388 RECORDS OP THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. sew years later, tbe introduction of the Royal Horse Artillery, and tbe discovery of tbe word \" mobility,\" had changed all that, and we read of the famous charge of Norman Ramsay's guns at Fuentes d'Onor in wonder at tbe marvellous transformation. School. \u2014 The first regimental school was established at Woolwich in 1798. Part of tbe Horse Artillery Square, then unfinished, was devoted to this purpose. The Barrack Field. \u2014 Before the Royal Artillery Barracks was built, only open fields prevailed from Green's End to Woolwich Common, as the plan on page 385 will show. The letters \" a, b,\" mark tbe position now occupied by tbe Army Service Corps Barracks (formerly tbe Royal Artillery Hospital), and tbe letters \" c, d, e, f,\" define tbe limits of the first portion of tbe present barracks. The foot path from Love Lane crossed the \" barrack-field \" towards Charlton, and the footway from Woolwich Church, now in part superseded by Mulgrave Place, bisected it in tbe direction of tbe Nightingale Valley. Mr. Bowater's farmhouse, if it were to rise again, would stand at the corner of Francis Street, built some years later ; and to resuscitate the Jolly Shipwrights in its original position, we should have to make it appear in the midst of the officers' tennis-ground. The Old Scene Revived. \u2014 This old tavern comes to life in a picture,* which has been happily preserved, to bring before us a feature of Woolwich that was dead and gone before any of us appeared on earth. This drawing is easily recognisable as the work of Paul Sandby, and may therefore be dated about 1778. The Common as it was. \u2014 The prospect which it affords of Woolwich Common exactly corresponds with the maps of that period. The waggon team in the middle distance is proceeding across the Common towards Charlton from \" Ditchwater Lane,\" or Nightingale Vale, and the eminence in the left rear is the wooded hill which now marks the bend in Lower Eglinton Road. When the old tavern was pulled down about 1800, t the name of the Jolly Shipwrights was taken by an inn near the Dockyard, now known as the Globe. The site of the house was enclosed within the Barrack Field, and the public road, which had curved to the westward in front of the tavern, was continued in a straight direction to a right-angled junction with Ditchwater Lane. The following references to^the Common are extracted from the Woolwich Vestry books : 1802.

Woolwich and Charlton Commons.\u2014 We do not see in Sandby's view tbe hedge and ditch which formerly ran down the Common from top to bottom, dividing it almost into equal parts, and this division-line is also absent from the survey of 1778. But it was there in 1748, as we gather from that fertile and valuable source of information, John Barker,* and the claim which the Cbarltonians sometimes set up to call the Common \" Charlton Common \" instead of \" Woolwich Common,\" will not, after looking at Barker's plan, appear at all presumptuous. The western portion, with a large projection upon which the Royal Horse Infirmary now stands, was then styled \" Charlton Common,\" and the position of the dividing hedge will be found to correspond approxi mately, though not exactly, with the boundary-line of the two parishes. The original of this plan is in the Royal Artillery Institution, an institution which is heartily thanked for preserving such an interesting record. The Common has since been levelled as far as practicable, but there are clear signs of a stream baving at one time flowed down the middle of it, and parish boundary lines were nearly always running brooks. The obsolete road, which we see brown and bare in dry weather stretching down from the reservoir to tbe corner of the Repository, was not abolished until about 1870, t and was doubtless a survival of the old footpath beside the older streamlet. Therefore, when the boys beat the bounds on Woolwich Common, I believe that they unconsciously follow the windings of a vanished waterway, vanished under the wizard hand of modern drainage. An Extinct Boad. \u2014 A bit of the defunct road just mentioned may be seen remaining close to Little Heath, running under the rear wall of the Repository ; and the willows along the trough are evidences of tbe departed stream which fed the ponds of the beautiful Bowater Park. The road, if the reader is disposed to trace it farther, may be picked up at Woodlands Terrace, and through the hills to the White Horse, thence straight across the marsh-land midway between Trinity Street and Harden's Manor-way, where it ended in the ferry stairs beside an ancient tavern, which in 1850 bore the honoured name of the Marquis of Wellington, and was kept by Mr. William Clothier. J Of * See plan of \" Woolwich and Charlton Commons, 1748,\" page 33. t When the road was abolished the circular road was given in exchange. (See \" Charlton.\") J In a plan of the Bowater Estate in 1820 this road is shown from the Wliite Horse direct to the river. A new road has just been made on nearly the same ground."], [36, "390 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the other roads on and about the Common there are only two which may be called aged,' and these are the Watling Street or Dover Road, which originally crossed the open waste, and the road from Charlton to Plumstead Common, which has existed from immemorial time. The present road on which are built the houses we call \"Woolwich Common \" was not laid out to Shooters' Hill and Eltham until the end of the last century, and the western fork of the same road towards Red Lion Lane is not very well defined in any of the eighteenth-century maps. Tbe traffic in each direction was inextensive and wandered at will all over the waste. Furze and underwood covered most of the double common ; there is an order in the Woolwich Vestry book of December 1723, forbidding any one to cut the said furze ; and in January, 174.3, the churchwardens were authorised to sell the furze for the relief of the poor. Old Settlers on the Common. \u2014 There were several houses built upon the Common, not off and aside, as we see them now, but out on the greensward. One was a famous bakery at the corner of the road which led across tbe Common,* with a special character for a special kind of tart, and there were several cottages at the edge of the green towards the south (see Map of 1778, Plate XIX). The Sale of the Common. \u2014 One day quite recently, groping among the musty files of the national archives, I came upon a report made by the surveyor of land to the Crown on the 23rd February, 1809, which will go far to remove a stigma which I have helped to cast upon the fathers of Woolwich. They have been accused of selling Woolwich Common to the Government early in the century for the insufficient sum of \u00a33,000, but, as it now appears that the Common was never theirs to sell, the \u00a33,000 which they obtained by the sale of their supposed rights to the Board of Ordnance may bo looked upon as a very good bargain. Eltham Manor.\u2014 The report of 1809 refers to a memorial made by Sir John Gregory Shaw, Bart., for a renewal of his lease of Eltham Manor, which was to expire on the 11th April, 1811, and in the schedule annexed are mentioned, \" Woolwich Common and four houses thereon \" (one being the baker's shop occupied by John Huddle), and also \" the site of three houses formerly built upon the waste but lately pulled down by the Board of Ordnance.\" The surveyor goes on to advise that at the expiration of the lease the commons of Eltham, Kidbrook, and Woolwich should be excepted from the new lease and transferred to the Ordnance, which was done ; and in 1811, when the al^^^"], [37, "WOOLWICH. 391 manorial rights of Charlton were purchased of the Wilson family, the sop of \u00a33,000 was given to Woolwich to satisfy any local objections to the scheme. But I think it will be quite clear that the exercise of the royal privileges over Eltham Manor had never ceased to include Woolwich since those privileges were established by judgment of the Exchequer Court in 1702.* Investigation of the subject amply proves that the sovereign of the realm has held the Manor of Woolwich for fully six hundred years, and it is gratifying to find that we can wipe away a slur upon the shrewdness of our respected progenitors \u2014 too hastily created upon merely superficial evidence. Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow ; He who would search for pearls must dive below The Transfer. \u2014 When the Common was transferred from the Crown ranger to the Board of Ordnance in 1802, the cottages and other enclo sures were purchased and cleared away, the furze was eradicated, and the present open drill-ground created. Four Acts of Parliament, by which the lands attached to the garrison at Woolwich were secured, may now be examined. Tbe first, which deals chiefly with the Barrack Field, is the Act \u2014 42 Geo. 3, c. 89, passed on June 22, 1802. It authorised the purchase, for the service of His \"Majesty's Ordnance at Woolwich, of \" The Common Lane Field\" of 5 acres 1 rood and 20 perches, and parcels of land called \" The Twelve Acres,\" \"The Further Five Acres,\" \" Wood's Barn Field \"of 5 acres, \"The Ruffs\" of 14 acres, \" The Horse Close \" of 77 acres, a small slip of land also called \" The Ruffs \" and planted with firs, containing 3 roods and 39 perches, another slip of 2 roods called \" The Wood Piece,\" near the Barn, and the private road or lane lying between the several pieces of land described and the west end of the Barrack Field , also the said Barrack Field, formerly consisting of seven closes or pieces of land, and con taining 53 acres 2 roods 26 perches. This land, which was all the property of John Bowater, is described as bounded on the south by Woolwich Common, on the west by land belonging to Lady Wilson, and on the north by other lands of John Bowater. All this is now comprised in the Barrack Field, the Gun Park, Repository, and adjacent grounds. Another act passed in the follow ing year (1803) to extend these purchases, was the George III. c. 35, an Act to purchase \u2014 2 acres 2 roods of a close called Wood's Piece, near the Barn ; also a parcel of land called Cottage Green, containing 2 roods and 2 perches ; also another parcel called Chimney Field, with the westward farmyard thereto adjoining, containing 8 acres 3 roods ; also three small cottages erected on the last-mentioned parcel, in the occu pation of Thomas Penn, Jeremiah Miles, and John Price ; also the parcel called Conduit Field, containing 4 acres 2 roods ; also Little Heath Field, containing 2 roods 18 perches ; also the eastward farmyard with stables and buildings, comprising 1 rood 11 perches ; also the stack-yard of 2 roods 19 perches , all of which are in the * Exchequer Sp. Com., 8 Wm. III. See page 21."], [38, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 392 tenure of Samuel Hardin.* Also the garden of Joseph Wellard, 2 roods ; the warden and two houses of Alexander Bryson, 1 rood; and the triangular parcel ot land called Mulgrave Place Field. Also the parcel of land with two cottages thereon called Rush Grove, situate at the south-east corner of the eastward farmyard, m the occupation of Henry Rideout. All the foregoing being the property of John Bowater, and being bounded on the south by the old and new Barrack Fields, on the west and north by other lands of John Bowater, and on the east at a point in Love Lane. Further, to purchase a part of the waste or common of the Manor of Charlton called Little Heath, from the stile at the north-west corner of Little Heath Field, in the course of the present footpath there, to the public highway leading from Charlton to Woolwich Common along the north side of Lady Wilson's Park, 470 yards in length and 30 feet in width, wliich it is intended to convert into a public carriage road leading from AVoolwich to Charlton.t Further, to purchase that piece of waste land called Woolwich Common, containing about 80 acres, in the parish of Woolwich, except all ancient highways, paths, &c, all of which Common is now held by Sir John Shaw as part of the Manor of Eltham under a lease from the Crown which will expire in 1810, but demised, on Sept. 28th, 1801, by Sir John Shaw to the King, at .\u00a321 a year, for the use of His Majesty's Ordnance, subject to all rights and interests to be hereafter assessed and determined. The next Act dealt with Charlton Common, being the Act \u2014 43 Geo. 3, c. 65. It authorised the purchase from Lady Wilson and Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, the parcel of waste land in the parish of Charlton known as Charlton Common, bounded on the south-west by the Dover Road and the south-east side by Woolwich Common, reserving to the Wilsons the right of \" a certain watercourse which runs from the said Dover Road, across tbe Common, into the park of Lady and Sir Thomas \"Maryon Wilson, and is principally used for supplying the said park with water, and which said watercourse is to be kept open and in repair by the owners of the said Common in time being for ever.\" This watercourse has now disappeared, and its position is doubtful. From the presence of water on the Kidbrook side of tbe Dover Road it may be assumed to have arisen from springs in the Cemetery Hill and crossed the road near the Earl of Moira. Finally, to complete the Repository, and acquire the Mulgrave Pond, which was needed for supplying the barracks and arsenal, and is still em ployed to charge the hydrants in the last-named place, we have the Act 44 Geo. 3, c. 79, passed on July 14, 1804, for the purchase of a parcel of land con taining 3 acres 3 roods and 27 perches, belonging to John Bowater, Esq., in the parish of Woolwich, bounded on the north by Little Heath, and also a parcel of garden ground belonging to Bowater and in the tenure of Samuel Hardin, bounded on the west by Little Heath ; also the \" triangular piece of land covered with water, called Mulgrave Place Pond,\" containing, \"when full,\" 2 acres and 25 perches, belonging to John Bowater. Woolwich and Charlton Commons were, however, not actually acquired until about the year 1806. Sir John Gregory Shaw's lease did not indeed expire until the 5th of April, 1811. He seems to have held * The eastward farmyard appears to have been that which stood near the corner ol trances Street and Artillery Place. See Plan, pa\"e 385. + Constructed in 1805-6.

Shooters' Hill Wood. \u2014 The woodlands mentioned were probably the Crown woods at Shooters' Hill, which the Surveyor-General thought had their value enhanced by being so near the dockyard and the river, and so readily available for shipbuilding. These woods, together with the commons of Eltham and Kidbrook at Shooters' Hill, Woolwich Common, and the houses at Woolwich, were transferred before 1811 to the Board of Ordnance, probably in 1806, for in that year the Garrison had 200 acres on Woolwich and Charlton Commons for exercising Royal Artillery Barracks, 1886. ground, and for extending tbe range, some purchased from the Dowager Lady Wilson, and some from Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, her son.

The Lonely Common. \u2014 From a very early period the command ing position of Woolwich Common seems to bave been recognised by the better class of residents, and houses of a superior order were located on its western margin longer ago than we have records to establish. The following narrative is quoted from the Canterbury News-Letter of January 10th, 1736, to show that the situation had its drawbacks : \u2014 Last Friday night, between seven and eight o'clock, Mr. Bristow's house on Woolwich Common, Kent, was beset by about seven or eight men, who knocked at the gate, the gardener, a maid-servant, and a boy being in the house. The boy went to the gate, which shut with a spring-lock, and, opening it, saw a man with a black crape over his face, who made to the gate ; but the boy being frightened, imme diately flung the gate to, and ran into the house crying out the devil was at the door, upon which the gardener went out and looked over the pales, and saw seven or eight men, all with black crape over their faces. He then ran and rang the alarm Tlie '\u2022' White Gate.' bell, which brought presently about two hundred people from Woolwich to their assistance, notwithstanding which, the rogues made off undiscovered When the boy opened the gate at first, a dog which the rogues had with them slipped into the yard and was seized by a mastiff that belonged to the house and killed, and is now publickly exposed m hopes of finding out the persons concerned. This is the second time this house has been attempted to be robbed this winter. The gardener \u201eave among the people who came to their assistance a guinea to drink The Barrack Field.-Until the barracks were built in 1775 the Barrack Field was merely farmland, and there is no sign of any road upon it m 17.A, other than the ancient footpath to the Common from the Parish Church This footpath now runs over the road past St George s Church, which was not formed into a road to the junction of Mill Lane at the \"\"White Gate \" until after 1810* The earliest * See plan of Ordnance property, page 62."], [41, "WOOLWICH. 395 provision made for carriage traffic in the direction of the Common, other than Mill (or Cholick) Lane, from the Warren, was by way of Frances Street, which was then extended on the line of the present footpath to the central gate of the Barrack Field, now and for many years known as the \" Blue Gate.\" \" Naw \" Cross. \u2014 The road was made as a means of comniunicatine; with the King's Dockyard, and led from the gate of that yard to Shooters' Hill, whence the king obtained his timber. I find this road for the first time in a map of London drawn by Roque in 1754. It is therein marked \" New Cross,\" but the name appears to have been corrupted by later authorities into \"Naw Cross,\" which I have been Long's Gate. informed was afterwards tbe adopted name of a row of cottages built by the roadside. The error was probably due to a simple confusion of names. In an Act of 17 Geo. II. (a.d. 1744), I find note of a sale of land and houses on the settled estate of Edward Bowater to the Commissioners of the Navy, including certain lands \"lately in the tenure of the widow Nor cross.\" The coincidence is at least curious. The Old Gates. \u2014 The enclosure of the Barrack Field by the Ha-ha Wall and the several gates appears to have been accomplished some time subsequent to 1810. The gates were usually kept closed except when opened by the sentries to allow troops and riders and carriages to pass through, and they were troublesome obstructions to traffic until their abolition, not many years since. The gate opposite Frances Street (variously known as the West Gate, Long's Gate,* Jack's Canteen * From Mr. John Long, who built the King's Arms."], [42, "396 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Gate, and the King's Arms Gate) was the most inconvenient, and the narrow side-passage for pedestrians was a dreadful annoyance on review days. On the gate being removed and tbe entrance widened, the parish undertook the maintenance of the road, which is now known throughout as Repository Road. The first stretch of it, from Frances Street to the Barrack Field, is a remnant of the \" New Cross \" just mentioned. The \"White Gate\" was taken off its hinges about the same time as the other, and the sentry permanently relieved. There was formerly a pike-gate at the Grand Depot Guardhouse in New Road, but it was generally open during the day, except on one day in every year when it was kept shut in order to maintain the privacy of the thoroughfare, a useless and absurd pretence which still survives. The accompanying sketches of the departed gates are supplied by Mr. H. A. Allison, who says : In the sketch of Long's Gate the building shown on the right is the old Guard Room, which I can remember perfectly unaltered for forty years. In 1854 gun sheds stood behind it (now workshops or stores). Below the gun sheds was the garrison pits, where the refuse litter, &c, from the stables was stored, and was removed by Farmer Dickson's carts to his farm at AVickham, the line of carts proceeding with military-like regularity to and fro. The old Regimental Schools then stood under the wall at that end of Artillery Place, and the ground on which the Forage Stores stand was the boys' playground. The Forage Stores were then opposite the North Arch, now Aleat Stores. Where the R.H.A. gun sheds now stand on Green Hill was then a beautiful grassy field, enclosed by chevaux-de-frise, which was the staple military fencing then, but which we see nowhere now. In this field the Friday afternoon foot parades ofthe R.H.A. and Field Batteries used to take place, when all the marching past music was performed by the trumpeters in unison. About the Crimean era the East Kent Alilitia were encamped there under canvas. In my drawing of Long's Gate I have put in an Artilleryman and a Marine in full dress, also a R.A. sergeant in un dress, showing the crimson sash then worn by sergeants round the waist. The Royal Artillery Bar racks.\u2014We have seen that the ground was taken for erecting the Royal Artillery Barracks in 1775, but only half of the present structure was then erected, and even that was not completed before 1782. The whole barracks was then comprised within the eastern half of the present edifice, including the east square and the South Arch of R.A. Barracks. m, ,,\u201e,., several wings on the same side.

It stands on a hillock, evidently created by the levelling of the surrounding soil, and affords one of several proofs that extensive earth-works were necessary to prepare the surface for building. Tbe site of the Barracks was the apex of Green Hill ; and the plateau of the Gun Park, with its steep acclivity on the side next the Commandant's Pond, may be safely surmised to have been formed by the surplus earth from the Barracks and Barrack Field. The Soldiers' Huts. \u2014 While the second half of the building was in course of erection, insufficient accommodation for the growing regiment drove many ofthe mar ried soldiers to camp out with their families on tbe Common, and they were allowed to build mud huts on the western margin, where there were a great number of them, in 1804, when the troops returned home after the peace of Amiens. They appear to have been miserable hovels, and the Dowager Lady Wilson, who was owner of the soil, charitably rebuilt them, substituting more comfortable, but a less multitude of, brick cottages. They were named, \" in honour \" of our great commander, the Duke of York's The Duke of York. Cottages,:*: but were also known as the Soldiers' Huts, and existed until 1875, when an outbreak of diphtheria called attention to their insanitary condition, and they were demolished.

In 1806 it was enlarged to accommodate seven hundred men, and it continued to serve all needs until the Herbert Hospital at Shooters' Hill was erected in 1854. Dr. Rollo, an eminent military surgeon, was actively engaged in its establishment and regulation for many years prior to his death, which took place in 1809. The Royal Marines. \u2014 Until 1805 there had been no regiment associated with the garrison of Woolwich other than the Royal Artillery ; but in that year, consequent on the vast and increasing importance of the Royal Navy, it was thought advisable to create a new division of Royal Marines and establish it here. The Woolwich division was at first small, and is said to have been located in the Dock yard,* but within five years it increased to the same strength as the three other divisions at Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham, con sisting of 6,200 officers and men, including 400 boys. In 1808 the Government purchased Mr. Whitby's brewery, a series of buildings covering a large area of ground next Frances Street, and with some slight alteration turned them into barracks for the Marines. t Camhridge Barracks. \u2014 The buildings were unsuitable, but the site, which stood on eight acres of rising ground, was most eligible ; and at length in 1847 the Government pulled down the old brewhouses and built the splendid pile wliich we now call the \" Cambridge Barracks.\" While it was in course of erection the marines were quartered in the Benbow, 74-gun ship, lying alongside the quay at the west end of the Dockyard. The Woolwich Division Dissolved. \u2014 The regiment remained in possession of the Barracks until that year of disaster, 1869, when the Woolwich Division was broken up and scattered, to the great sorrow of all belonging to it, and the lasting regret of the townspeople. The \u25a0 , Mr-,Thrc'ma,s Ma?d,y tells me that lle never heard of the Marines being quartered within the Dockyard, but recollects an unsightly old brick building at the eastern end of the yard wall on the Lower Road being used as a guardhouse, from which sentries were posted at intervals outside the wall, in which recesses were made for sentry-boxes now bricked up as we see them. My authority for believing that the nucleus was formed in the Dockyard was an old marine who had many times marched from thence to St. Marys Church on Sundays. The interval on board the Benbow, mentioned in the next paragraph, may supply a key to the enigma t The property was taken on lease for 99 years on payment of \u00a35,300. The brew house, I am informed, was built by Mr. Henry Rideout about 1805, and the property was sold to the Government (alter his death in 180G) by his hei'rs, one ofXn, Captain Rideout, had a residence near the spot many years afterwards."], [45, "WOOLWICH. 399 Garrison was its home, towards which every unit felt an attraction all the world about ; and constant association one with another, and in the same spot, had given it a family feeling which was the source of many gratifying incidents, the influence of which extended not only through out tbe Garrison, but all over the town and neighbourhood. Frances Street was for the most part the product of the Royal Marine Barracks. A residence was found for the Commandant of the regiment in the Manor-bouse on \"Mount Pleasant\" (Bowater House), and the second Commandant resided in the house which is now a shop at the corner of Ogilby Street. All the other houses in the same row were occupied by married officers,* others resided in Bowling Green Row, and George Street, where the houses were all of a superior character and tenanted by the elite of Woolwich, not only officials in the Government service, but private families of independent means. The completion of the railway to Greenwich (which was the first line constructed in the vicinity of London) seemed to bring about a change in the character of George Street. It was, however, a boon to Wool- wich, and created a smart competition on the road. About a dozen carts, of various kinds, but mostly provided with tilt covers, were usually seen waiting for hire at the bottom of the hill by the Dockyard, but the bulk of the traffic was in the hands of a Mr. Burke, proprietor of the Ship Hotel, who after a distinguished career in the prize-ring and other circles, removed about this time from the Cooper's Arms (Plaisted's) in High Street, and converted the Ship from a stately hotel into a modern public- house. He had several omnibuses and waggonettes running daily to and from Greenwich and London. The Red Barracks. \u2014 The Royal Marine Infirmary was built in 1859, in substitution of the hospital in rear of the Marine Barracks, which hospital was originally built in 1815, and is now converted into soldiers' rooms and offices. It stands on the ground once occupied by the manor-house of the Bowaters, just mentioned. When the Marine Barracks became the \" Cambridge \" it was turned over to the Infantry^, and at tbe same time the Infirmary wras transformed into the \" Red Barracks,\" and transferred to a branch of the Army Service now known as the Ordnance Store Corps. This Red Barracks, seen from a dis- tance, is the most conspicuous and striking feature of the town of Woolwich. It is visible over the plains of Essex for twenty or thirty miles. * Many respected officers, retired from the Royal Marines, remained residents at Woolwich. The public drinking fountain at the north-east corner of AVoolwich Common was erected by bis widow to the memory of one who was well known, Major R. I. Little, R.M., who died in 1862. Another was Colonel Congdon, who took an active part in promoting the interests of the locality to the end of his life. c c 2"], [46, "CHAPTER XXXV ti:e gentlemen CADETS The Royal Military Academy. \u2014 Away on the other verge of tbe garrison domain is the Royal Military Academy, which, both as an edifice and institution, is its proudest posses sion.

The First Academy. \u2014 It should be premised that a school for Royal Artillery officers has existed in some shape ever since the regiment itself was set on foot in 1719,* but it was not until 1741 that such an agency7 was fully recognised and permanently7 fixed. The warrant is addressed by King George II. to the Duke of Montagu, Master-General, is dated April 30, 1741, and is styled a \" warrant for establishing a school for practitioner engineers.\" It sets forth that \" it would conduce to the good of our service if an academy or school was instituted, endowed, and supported, for instructing the raw and inexperienced people belonging to the military branch of the Ordnance in the several parts of mathematics necessary to qualify them for service in the artillery and the business of engineers, and that there is a convenient room at Woolwich Warren, which is our property7, and may be fitted up for that purpose.\" Thereupon rules and orders were * It is vaguely stated that \" there was anciently in or near Charlton a school of the same nature.\" \u2014 European Magazine, May, 1810."], [47, "[To lace page 4(10.] Royal Military Academy, 1884.

The amount was promptly increased to \u00a31,000 a year by a second warrant in the following November, and this was the annual grant sanctioned by Parliament until 1771, when it was raised to \u00a31,364. The lectures and classes were at first attended not only by cadets, but by officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Royal Artillery. Colonel Jones adopts the theory that the building allotted to the original Academy (now pattern- room, Royal Laboratory), was erected on the site of a Mansion House once inhabited by Prince Rupert.* Cadet Gunners. \u2014 In 1744, the master ofthe Academy reported to the Duke of Hontagu that the regiment of artillery consisted of seven companies, and five cadets to each company \u2014 distinguished as cadet gunners at 16d. per day and cadet matrosses at 12d. per day. They were mustered with their com panies, but took the right hand, and were treated as officers and gentlemen. They lodged and boarded at the most creditable houses in Woolwich, which many were able to do on their pay, and Government provided only their uniforms. In the same year they were formed into a cadet company of forty cadets, with four officers and one \" drum-major.\" They had to mount guard and provide a sentry for the commanding Gentleman Cadet and Corporal, 1820. officer's door. Several very enter taining letters written to his parents by one of these early cadets in 1750 are preserved. According to this authority the cadets gave stage plays once a month \" in a room t opposite the Academy in which the Board of Ordnance sat ; \" and the young gentlemen were accustomed, when visited by their friends, to dine with them at the Crown and Anchor.

In 1754 a detachment which embarked for the East Indies included twelve cadets, and some are afterwards spoken of as \" on command,\" both in India and Scotland. The pay of each cade was increased to 2s. 6d. per day in 1764, and in the same year the first Lieutenant-Governor, \"James Pattison, Esq.,\" was appointed at \u00a3200 a year. He had, however, been for five years m charge as Captain- Lieutenant \" At the same time the institution was first dubbed Ihe Royal Military Academy,\" and the officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates ceased to receive instruction with the cadets. Certain students, called \" gentlemen attendants,\" were admitted, but did not reside in barracks, nor board with the cadets. There was a house keeper at the \"new\" barracks, and toward her the young gentle men were commanded to behave with civility and good manners. Until this date (1764) children of three and four years had been entered for the Academy, but henceforward they were required to be of the stipulated age of twelve. The establishment was formed into an \" upper \" and \" under \" academy in the year 1772; in 1782 the number of cadets wasincreased to sixty7, and in 1798 to one hundred, of whom forty were claimed for the East India Company. Additional cadets were also enrolled and sent to private schools in the neighbourhood until vacancies occurred at the Academy7. \" John Company \" paid down \u00a33,000 for extra accommodation, and agreed to contribute \u00a3100 for every Indian cadet. In 1803 the extra cadets were sent to the college at Great Marlow. Old Times, Old Manners. \u2014 Discipline and manners were regu lated by a strict code of laws in the early days of the Academy7. The line between the Academy7 and Regiment was not, however, so strin gently7 drawn as at present, and in 1797 a cadet contrived to excuse him self for some offence by the plea that he had been dining at the Royal Artillery mess, but, in order to crush the precedent, it was sternly commanded that dining at the mess should be thenceforth prohibited.* * This order was relaxed in 1822."], [51, "WOOLWICH. 403 Cadets' Tails. \u2014 In 1798 it was directed that those cadets whose length of hair would not permit of the regulation queue of four inches were to use their endeavours to promote its growth as much as possible; and any one who should crop his hair was to be degraded until his queue had acquired the regimental length. Further, in 1799, the queue was ordered to be ten inches long, and the Academy hair-dresser Cadets at Gun Drill. was authorized to supply false tails to the gentlemen who needed them. All who cropped were to be \" confined to the Green* until it was long enough to tie again.\" But the arbitrary fashion did not last very long.

In cases of great emergency, however, it is alleged that cadets bave been known to prepare these fraudulent epistles themselves, and it is recorded that on one occasion a young gentleman was in such haste to get away that he forgot to be cautious : \u2014 \" Sir,\" said the Governor, with the letter in his hand, \" Ask your grandmother, the nest time she writes to say she is dying, to dry her ink ! \""], [53, "WOOLWICH. 405 The Third Academy. \u2014 The present Academy on Woolwich Common was in course of erection in 1805, and Cube House, adjacent, was taken for a cadets' hospital.* In this year the establishment was increased to two hundred cadets, and forty-six additional for the East India Company. In 1806, when the building was finished.t there were one hundred and twenty-eight cadets at the upper establishment (on the Common), sixty in the lower establishment (the Arsenal), and another sixty at Marlow.

This building has since been enlarged by additional wings as occasion required. Notable Events. \u2014 In 1815 the cadets' bathing-pond was formed in rear of the veterinary establishment.

OLD SOLDIERING Inspection and Dinner. \u2014 Woolwich Common, though still the waste of the manor for many years after the Garrison grew up ahout it, was from the earliest times made use of as a drill and practice ground for the Royal Artillery, just as Plumstead Common was. In a journal of February 27th, 1776, we read that \u2014 On Saturday there was another proof of cannon on Woolwich Com mon, before Lord Townsend, Sir Jef fery Amherst, General Balfour, &c, of small pieces of six and three pounders, of grape-shot only, after which his lordship examined the young cadets to see which were fit to be commissioned.

His Majesty was dressed in scarlet and mounted on a cream-coloured horse. Hard Times for the R.A. \u2014 At this time the Royal Artillery was undergoing a series of augmentations, and the twenty-five years which passed between the erection of the two divisions of the barracks, per plexed as they were by troubles abroad, were also unsettled by changes at home. The comfort of the soldiers was little studied, and, added to the war with France and Spain and the panic of a threatened invasion, we had a financial crisis in the State, and a nation impoverished by pitiful legislation. The services were grinding under harassing work and intolerable discipline, and the naval discontent which culminated in the mutiny at the Xore burst forth in the same year (1797) among the soldiers at Woolwich. \"While the sailors seized the ships, sent their officers on shore and hoisted the red flag, the Royal Artillery men turned their officers out of barracks, fortified themselves within the building, and hung out placards demanding \"more pay and less drill.\"* They had long protested against their food, which was inferior and insufficient, but had obtained no satisfaction, and, in resorting to this extreme measure of insubordination they declared that their only object was to call attention to their grievances. Meanwhile, to their credit, they carried on all the garrison duties in good order and peace, and when the Government sent down a commission of enquiry, they made so good a case that they were not only forgiven, but obtained a con cession on nearly every point of their demands. Drastic Discipline. \u2014 In comparison, however, with the discipline of to-day, the discipline which continued to prevail even until recent times was stern in the extreme. The following paragraph from a newspaper of 1790 was of no unusual kind, but would at the present time be impossible. The soldier who acted as servant to Colonel Stehelin at Woolwich, and some short time past fired a blunderbuss through the windows to impress his master with the idea of defending the house against robbers, in hopes of being advanced to a halbert, has been tried by Court Martial and sentenced to receive 500 lashes and be drummed out of the regiment. Strength. \u2014 In 1794 the regiment consisted of four marching battalions and two troops of Horse Artillery. A few years later it bad ten battalions, twelve troops of horses, and an invalid battalion. The Repository.\u2014 The Royal Military Repository made its appear ance on the pleasant slopes to the north-west of the Common within a short time after the Artillery settled in their new barracks. The late Superintendent, Colonel Richardson, showed me the following extract"], [63, "WOOLWICH. 413 from garrison orders given at \"Woolwich by General \"Williamson on the 24th December, 1778 :\u2014 Copy of a letter from the Right Hon. and Hon.

It is related that Sir William Congreve, returning in his carriage from London to Charlton, where he resided, was attacked by two footpads, who issued from a pit on the side of the road crossing the heath, called the Devil's Punchbowl. He fired a pistol at the miscreants, who then decamped, and were tracked to Hanging Wood, where they escaped. There is a trial in the Newgate Calendar of two highwaymen who were pursued by the whole garrison of Woolwich, hunted for several miles, and eventually captured in this wood, where they had gone to earth in an old drain. It has been surmised that Hanging Wood was the abode of the \" Tom ofthe Wood \" mentioned in Pepys' Diary (see page 274). The Rotunda. \u2014 In its public aspect the Repository is best known as the locality of the Rotunda and its remarkable museum of military curiosities. This building, the circular form of which, combined with its tent-like roof, present such a conspicuous figure in the landscape, was originally erected in St. James's Park upon the occasion of the visit of the Allied Sovereigns to this country in 1814.* The Rotunda is 116 feet in diameter, and covers an area of 10,600 square feet, being very nearly two-thirds as large as Westminster Hall. The central pillar, by which the roof is at present in part supported, is a comparatively recent addition. As originally constructed, and for several years after its removal to Woolwich, tlie roof was entirely self-sustained ; nothing prevented the eye from taking in the full extent of the surface covered. To this building, after its erection on the present site, * There is a model of St. James's Park in the Rotunda, showing this and the other buildings erected on that festal occasion. D D"], [64, "EECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 414 were transferred in 1820 the objects which the great fire of 1802 had spared of the original contents of the Repository founded in the Arsenal in 1778 by Captain (after wards Lieutenant-General Sir) W. Congreve. There are about one hundred and sixty of these objects extant, in various classes. A large proportion of the models, however, date no further back than the period when the so-called Colonel Congreve, son of Sir W. Congreve, was at the head of the Repository. The museum abounds with records of the fertile invention and mechanical genius of both these remarkable men. To the original collection as thus constituted the Prince Regent was pleased to transfer a small but valuable collection of medi\u00e6val arms and armour; and finally, since the transfer of the establishment by Lord Herbert, of Lea, from the custody of the Commandant of the Garrison of Woolwich to that of the Ordnance Select Committee, in 1859, the liberality of the Government has permitted several purchases of arms and models, as well as the deposition of a great variety of objects which have already passed out of the service, or are in danger of doing so at an early date.* The Rotunda about 1825 Originally a mere marquee, the Rotunda is now a solid and perma nent structure. The only portion remaining of the original materials are the ropes which radiate from the crown, and support the roof. These were formerly gilt, each with gold to the value of \u00a315, now under a coat of paint. Instead of the canvas awning which was erected in St. James's Park, the Rotunda has a roof of sheet lead. The darkness of the room and the inadequacy of the catalogue rendered the museum of little value, till by the addition of windows in the roof and a careful revision of the catalogues in 1863-4, and subsequently by several judicious purchases and liberal donations, the whole aspect of the place has been changed and its useful ness fully developed. This good result has been mainly effected by the untiring exertions and assiduous supervision of General Lefroy. The Gibraltar Model. \u2014 Among the treasures preserved from the fire in the Laboratory, the most prominent is the model of Gibraltar * General Lefroy's Catalogue."], [65, "WOOLWICH. 415 before mentioned.* This, while it was in the Warren, attracted the admiration of all beholders, as it does to-day, and a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine of August, 1798, describing \" the magnificence of Woolwich Warren,\" thus exclaimed : \u2014 I walked yesterday morning to Woolwich Warren, that immense repository of military arts, the palladium of our Empire, where one wonder succeeds another so rapidly, that the mind of a visitor is kept in a continual gaze of admiration. Should I be asked, What has made the strongest impression on mine '\"* it is a magnificent view of the rock of Gibraltar, wliich was made there, formed of the very rock itself, on a scale of 25 feet to an inch, and presents a most perfect view of it in every point of perspective. I am elated with the honest joy of an Englishman, the glory of a Briton, that we could presume to take this gem from the crown of Spain, and, for 100 years, keep possession of it on their own shores, in open contempt of all the force of France and Spain combined.\" Connolly's \" History ofthe Sappers and Miners,\" says that the model of Gibraltar was destroyed by the fire of 1802, and that the one in the Rotunda is the north end of Gibraltar. The reader may see it and judge. The Bank-note Cinder.- \u2014 -Among the other manifold wonders of the Rotunda is shown a cinder, which is the sole residue of the old bank-notes burnt in 1844, at the time when the one-pound notes were suppressed. There were one hundred and forty-four thousand of them, and the work of destruction occupied three months. The nominal value ofthe notes was \u00a37,500,000. Sir Alexander Dickson. \u2014 In the Repository, on the same plan as the Rotunda, is a stately monument erected in 1847 by the Officers of the Royal Artillery to the memory of Major-General Sir Alexander Dickson. It records his many and distinguished services. The Haunt of Birds. \u2014 The beauty and seclusion ofthe Repository grounds render them a favourite resort in the summer months, but the privilege of entrance is rigidly restricted. Being thus jealously guarded against intruders, its groves are the haunt of numerous birds, some of whom have made their homes in strange places. In 1885, a pair of spar rows built their house in the axletree box of the time-gun at the Gun Park, a 9-pounder, from which twice every day a round was fired, and, notwithstanding the frequent interruption, succeeded in rearing a family of five young birds. The entrance to the nest was by a hole in the side of the box, the carriage being an old one. A few years previously a nest was built in one of the big shells in the Repository, t \u2022 Page 338. t At the same time a nest was to be seen on the top of the lamp which hung over the door of Shooters' Hill Police Station, and a pair of robins in 1884 built their nest in a water-can as it hung on a garden wall close to the back door of a house in Brewer Street. DD 2"], [66, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 416 The Repository Ponds.-The ornamental water in the Repository, and the pond in the Commandant's garden, were atone time much more used than at present for experiment and practice in pontoomng, bridging, &c. Brayley, in his History of Kent (1806), says :\u2014 On the west side of the Barracks is a piece of water where experiments with gun boats, &c, are occasionally made ; a new road from this quarter towards Charlton has just been opened. This is the highway known as the Upper Road to Charlton, including Hill Street and Little Heath. Mortar Battery.\u2014 Brayley also says :\u2014 On the parade in front of the Barracks the soldiers are frequently exercised in throwing shells, for which the open space on the Common affords sufficient room. Gun Practice on the Barrack Field in 1843. This refers to the mortar battery in the Gun Park. It exists to-day, much as it has done from the beginning, though it has not been made available for shot or shell practice for a good many years. A guide-book published in 1820 says : \u2014 From the mortar and howitzer battery during summer practice may be seen going on every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, commencing at half-past nine in the morning. At 850 yards* on the Common stands a flagstaff, which is the object aimed at, and such is the skill and proficiency of the men, and of the gentlemen cadets, who also practise there, that the flagstaff is often cut in two by the shot. * Tbe flagstaff whenever I saw it was to the left of the camp road and less than 100 yards from the Ha-ha. The range was more like a quarter than half a mile."], [67, "417 WOOLWICH. Risky Work. \u2014 The marvellous point of this record is that it has not to tell of numerous fatalities. The range party of about ten men usually stood by the clump of trees within eighty yards of the flagstaff, and each man marked where a shot fell. Some of the balls went ricochetting up the Common, until they reached the Shooters' Hill Road, occasionally knocking a few bricks out of one of the cottages on the road-side, but the only fatal disaster recounted is that which befell an unlucky cadet in 1833. We read \u2014 On Tuesday afternoon (May 3), during tbe trial of some pieces on Woolwich Common, a serious accident happened. After the discharge of many shells at the flagstaff stationed upwards of 600 yards from the place of firing, one which was con sidered to have been discharged better than any of the previous ones was carried more than 100 yards beyond the mark, and in its course meeting with some obstacle branched off in an oblique direction and struck a young gentleman, a cadet named Bull, son of Colonel Bull, of Woolwich, who was lying on the grass, and wounded him in a most frightful manner above the hip. As soon as it was perceived that the youth was wounded all present hastened to the spot where he was lying, when he calmly said, \" It is all over with me ; have they sent for the doctor ?\" Surgical assistance was procured by some gentlemen who were on horseback, but his Use could not be saved. The jeopardy increased year by year with the traffic, but it was not till 1860, or thereabout, that the range was given up. Royal Artillery Institution. \u2014 We must not quit this quarter without noticing that it was at the Repository, as may be imagined, the Royal Artillery Institution and College had its origin. This is recorded as follows in public print : \u2014 Jan. 26, 1839. \u2014 A room at the Royal Military Repository has been fitted up for temporary accommodation of the Regimental Scientific Institution, and was opened on Monday last. Capt. Robe and Lieutenant Smith, R.A., have offered the benefit of their instructions to officers who may desire to learn the use of the instru ments, &c. The advanced class, as it was termed, has lately been renamed \" The Royal Artillery College.\" The museum, lecture room, and offices of the Royal Artillery Institution at the eastern end of the barracks were not built until 1854. Twenty years later the observatory on Greenhill, which is a branch of the same establishment, was furnished with its magnificent telescope at a cost of \u00a3500. Royal Artillery Races. \u2014 -The Royal Artillery race meetings are another regimental institution of many years' standing.* The races took place on the Common until about 1860 ; the usual course was \"once round and a distance,\" and the judge's post was near the Royal Military Academy. In 1862, the Royal Artillery .steeple-chases super- * Public race meetings were at one time held on Woolwich Common ; the last was in 1827."], [68, "EECOEDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTEICT. 418 seded the flat racing, and the meet was transferred to Well Hall Farm, at Kidbrook, then to Eltham, Bromley and elsewhere, until within the last few years a course, which promises to be permanent, has been found at Abbey Wood.* The following newspaper slips relate to the earlier, if not the earliest, days of Woolwich military races. Oct. 10, 1840.\u2014 The Master-General of the Ordnance having given permission to the junior officers of the Royal Horse Artillery to have a day's racing on Woolwich Common, the course is being now marked out. Thursday, October 15th, is the day fixed. October, 1841.\u2014 A change of ministry having removed the interdict to racing on Woolwich Common, one of the prettiest spots for the purpose within 50 miles of London, the officers have set about their revival in earnest. The course, about a mile and a half round, with a hill in going out and a fair run in, is in every respect adapted to the sport. October 8, 1841.\u2014 The Royal Military Academy was instituted in 1719, but its permanent establishment was not completed until the 5th of October, 1741. f Tuesday, October 5, 1841, was consequently considered a centenary of the institu tion, and the gentlemen cadets were granted a holiday, divided at their own request into two half-holidays, that they might witness the garrison races, which happened to take place on the 5th and following day.\" A Cadet Riot. \u2014 In 1870, the fourth year of the steeple-chases, and of the change of venue to the Well Hall Fields, there was an unfortunate affair for the peace and reputation of the Royal Military Academy. The following is the newspaper report of \u2014 April 16, 1870.\u2014 On the occasion of the recent garrison steeple-chases at Woolwich J the gentlemen cadets were allowed to attend, and, contrary to the practice of late years, were admitted to the officers' refreshment tent. After luncheon the young gentlemen, who were all in uniform, formed a double line and marched down the racecourse, an act which provoked some hostility, but led to no serious consequences. Soon afterwards, however, some of the cadets got into a fray with the gipsies, who usually attend fairs and races, and the sticks used at \" Aunt Sally \" were freely hurled about on both sides. The police interfered, and Superintendent Griffin of the R Division was rather roughly handled, his uniform being torn, but in the end order was restored, and if the matter had finished that day nothing serious would probably have happened. Mr. Griffin, however, had no alternative but to report the matter to the Police Commissioners, and, in due course, information ofthe fact was sent from Scotland Yard to the Governor of the Academy, Major-General Sir J. L. Simmons. The superintendent was thereupon sent for to pick out the particular offenders, and when he reached the Academy was treated in a very offensive manner by some of the cadets, who at last barricaded him in a room. From this, however, he was soon released by the authorities, and an inquiry was commenced on Saturday last, pending the issue of which the cadets were forbidden to leave the Academy enclosure. This appears to have aggravated their discontent, for in their eyes the occurrence at the races was of trivial import, and In 1889 (April 8) the steeple-chases were held at Kempton Park. t I am not answerable for these dates, and do not accept them % Held at Kidbrook, Monday, April 4, 1870."], [69, "PLATE XLV Rinjal Artillery Steeplechases. [To face page 418.]"], [70, ""], [71, "WOOLWICH. 419 their indignation found vent in various ways. The most serious overt act took place after nightfall on Saturday, when one of the 9-pounder guns which stand at the corners of the enclosure was dismounted and thrown into the moat below,* the established mode by wliich the cadets have on previous occasions manifested their dissatisfaction. On Monday an investigation was held in the presence of the Governor, and as a consequence three young gentlemen were dismissed, and left the Academy for their homes next morning. The remainder of the cadets have been lectured, and reminded of the words uttered by the president of the institution, the Duke of Cambridge, a few months ago, when he warned them that the uniform they wore placed them in an exceptional' position, and that if they committed any breach of discipline or morals they must expect exceptional punishment. A little later we read \u2014 On Thursday the gentlemen cadets studying at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, returned from their short vacation at Easter to that institution. In the afternoon two out of the three gentlemen who were dismissed by the Governor returned to the Academy, but the third has not yet done so ; we understand, however, that he will do so before long. On Thursday two other gentlemen cadets in the first or commission class were ordered to return to their homes, and did so, accom panied by one of the officers of the Academy. The cause of the rustication or dismissal, whichever may be decided upon, is connected with the unfortunate occurrence at the recent steeple-chases. Another gentleman was severely reprimanded at a parade of the company of cadets. Gas Light. \u2014 -A few further extracts will relate to the interior economy of the Royal Regiment of Artillery fifty years ago. Prior to 1837, the barrack rooms and all parts of the barracks had no better illuminant than candles, of which the wax kind was a special luxury reserved for the officers' messroom. But in November, 1837, we read that arrangements were made for a supply of gas to the barracks from the Woolwich Company, and for twenty years or so the town and the garrison had their light from the same source. The erection of gas works within the Royal Arsenal was, however, ultimately turned to the advantage of the other government works, and, after some resistance on the part of the gas-interest in the town, the whole of the barracks and other military establishments were supplied, as they are now, direct from the Arsenal. Flogging. \u2014 Here is a paragraph of a kind which was once frequent, but now happily never seen : \u2014 September 23rd, 1839. \u2014 The whole of the horse and foot Artillery were mustered in front of the Artillery Barracks to witness the punishment of the lash on a gunner who had stolen sixteen shillings from a comrade. His sentence was to receive a hundred and fifty lashes and be drummed out. During the flogging the drums were beat to stifle his cries. His back and loins were most dreadfully lacerated by the cat-o'-nine tails, and when he was released the blood was streaming from his flesh and dyed the ground. Several men were sick at heart and fainted away during the torture. * See illustration at page 407."], [72, "420 EECOEDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTEICT Flogging in the army and navy died slowly, but was virtually abolished by 1860. Uniform in 1840. \u2014 Another feature of the old times, and another change \u2014 -a change of costume \u2014 are marked in the following para graph : \u2014 Oct. 17th, 1840. \u2014 The white trousers hitherto worn by the Royal Artillery are in future to be discontinued and a light blue of thin texture will be substituted , Arms. \u2014 At that time the men of the field batteries, or \"foot artillerymen,\" were armed with carbines and bayonets only, and devout!}7 envied the cavalry swords of the Royal Horse. The moral of the following announcement can therefore well be understood : \u2014 \u2022 Nov. 6th, 1841. \u2014 Owing to the great destruction of muskets by the late fire at the Tower of London, it is intended to remove those at present used by the Royal Artillery, and in store at Woolwich, amounting to seven thousand, to the Tower, in case they should be required at short notice. The gunners and drivers of the Royal Artillery will mount guard with swords in the same manner as the Rpjyal Horse Artillery. This will give great satisfaction. Royal Reviews. \u2014 Woolwich Common was the scene of many Royal pageants in the interval of peace which lay between the death of King George the Third and the Russian war. We read in a paper of \u2014 July, 1830.\u2014 On Tuesday the town of Woolwich presented the gayest appearance we ever wit- nessed, in consequence of his Majesty (William the Fourth) reviewing the Royal Artillery and Engineers. His Majesty was accompanied by his Royal Consort Queen Adelaide, the Princess Augusta, the King of Wirteniberg, the Duke of Cumberland, Prince George of Cumberland, Prince Leopold, Lord Combermere, Lord Fitzroy Somerset, and others of distinction. . . . The officers of the Artillery bad tbe honour of kissing hands as his Majesty passed. After the review the Royal party proceeded to the mess-room In the course of the entertainment his Majesty gave the following toasts : \u2014 \" The Royal Artil lery,\" \" The Duke of Wellington, and the Army and Navy combined.\" Lord Hill then proposed the health of his Majesty. William IV. The account of another review by the same sovereign is dated July 21th, 1835.\u2014 The expected visit of their Majesties yesterday to review the troops at Woolwich, and the facility of conveyance afforded by the steamboats (now running for twelve months past) drew an immense number of spectators.

The ground was kept by 200 of the Royal Life Guards and a guard of honour consisted of the Grenadier Guards with the band. At twelve their Majesties, escorted by a strong detachment of the 8th Hussars, attended by the Dukes of Cumberland find Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge,* Lord Hill, Sir Hussey Vivian, the King's aide-de-camp, &c, arrived on the ground. . . . The marching was of great excellence, particularly that of the Marines ; it was the first time that this dis tinguished regiment was allowed to be reviewed in conjunction with tbe other troops of the garrison . . . His Majesty then proceeded to the howitzer and mortar batteries, where five rounds of six guns from each battery were fired at a flag 1,200 yards distant, the fence building of which was hit several times. Their Majesties then proceeded to the mess-room, where a costly breakfast was served, after which the exercise of the rocket brigade on the marshes took place. ... It is computed that there were 100,000 persons present and nearly 300 carriages. The only casualty we have heard of is that of an artilleryman's leg being taken off by a shell on the marshes, through his own imprudence in getting within its range. Royal Rivals. \u2014 This was a time of peace, but there were always parties in the state and in the nation, and, being parties, there was 6trife. A dinner took place in this same year (1835) at the Barrack Tavern on Woolwich Common, a report of which lets a little light into some of the political vexations of the hour. It runs : \u2014 About forty gentlemen sat down to dinner after the dahlia show of the Woolwich Florists' Society, Mr. Bernard in the chair, and the toast of \" The King \" was given with loud cheers. Then the chairman said this was not a political meeting, and proposed the health of \" Princess Victoria, patroness of flowers.\" Mr. Glenny then rose and asked what tbe Queen had done that her health had not been proposed. The chairman's toast was drunk, and then Mr. J. Butler said he would not drink another glass until the Queen's health bad been drunk, and Mr. Nokes immediately proposed her Majesty's health, wliich was drunk with long-continued cheering. Mr. Mortis then sang \" Sir Andrew Agnew's Bill.\" R. A. Mess. \u2014 With the foregoing should be read the following, which is one of the most notable records in the annals of the Royal Artillery mess : \u2014 June, 1836.\u2014 His Royal Highness, the Prince of Orange, accompanied by the Hereditary Prince, and Prince Alexander and suite, were entertained at a grand dinner by the officers of the Royal Artillery. When the health of the King was drunk, the Artillery fired a royal salute, and also at the health of the Prince of Orange. The toasts of the Queen and the Princess Victoria were given with similar marks of loyalty, and numerous other toasts were given and speeches made by the Master-General of the Ordnance, Sir Hussey Vivian, who presided; the late Master-General, the Marquis of Anglesea, Lord Hill, and others. The entertainment was conducted by Messrs. Kinnear and Blest, of the Artillery Corps. The Queen's Coronation. \u2014 In less than a year later the King was gathered to his fathers, and the young Princess Victoria was called to ascend the throne. On the day of her Majesty's coronation, in the * The present Duke."], [76, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTEICT. 422 following year, the town and garrison mingled in an overflow of rejoicing. The event is thus described : \u2014 1838, June 28th.\u2014 Yesterday, a gay procession was formed under the arrangement of Mr. Watts, the High Constable, for the purpose of proclaiming the Queen's title throughout the town of Woolwich. A detachment of Horse Artillery, with colours flying, headed the cavalcade, then came the police, and next many of the respectable inhabitants mounted on horseback. After them followed the Artillery Band, playing appropriate tunes ; then the parochial authorities, a fresh display of flags and banners, a body of the inhabitants marching six abreast, the royal standard sustained by six men, the band of the Sappers and Miners, the local magistrates in their carriages, flanked by constables and by men bearing tbe flags of the Kent Militia ; next the Marine Band with more flags, and carriages of gentlemen, and the procession was closed with a body of Horse Artillery. The procession first went to the Dockyard, where proclamation was made ; thence they went to the old market-place, where all the children of the workhouse and the national school were drawn up ; here the proclamation was again read, and it was afterwards read at the Royal Arsenal, at the front of the Royal Artillery Barracks, in the centre of the houses on Woolwich Com mon, and finally at the Royal Marine Barracks. Military Feast. \u2014 An address was also presented to her Majesty from a vestry meeting at which the Rev. W. Greenlaw presided. The mover was Mr. Robert Jolly, and the seconder, Mr. Henry Rideout. But the special celebration of the auspicious occasion by the garrison was reserved for the 6th of July. Its chief feature is presented in the graphic illustration at Plate XLL, and it is thus described in a paper of\u2014 July 6th, 1838. \u2014 -Yesterday a grand review and sports took place at Woolwich. The coaches which ply between London and Woolwich discharged loads of passengers, and from every direction carriages, equestrians, and pedestrians poured in. There could not have been less than 100,000 persons present. Amongst the illustrious visi tors were Prince George of Cambridge, the Prince of Saxe-Coburg, the Duke de Nemours, Marshal Soult, the Prince de Ligne, and the Embassies assembled in London to do honour to the Queen's coronation. The firing commenced on the practice range in the marshes by a discharge of thirty twelve-pounder rockets at a target. The company visited the mechanical wonders at the Arsenal, and then proceeded to the Common, where the Artillery went through the man\u0153uvres of attack and defeat, and several rounds of cannon were fired. Sir Hussey Vivian, Master-General of the Ordnance, received the salute, and Lord Bloomfield, the Commandant at Woolwich had the chief command. Not less than five lines of carriages were drawn outside the line in some places, but all round the square brilliant equipages were thickly congre gated. On the side of the line that fronted the barracks, and from the lawn of which the Common-ground is divided by a ditch and a brick wall, the pressure was very great. Several persons were sorely bruised. A splendid breakfast was afterwards served in the mess-room. About 800 guests sat down. The toast of \" the Queen \" was announced to the multitude by a salute of cannon fired by officers exclusively, the men being all engaged at dinner, which was served to them and their families, in num ber 4,500, on the barrack-field. Then followed the old English sports : and at night there was more feasting and a splendid show of fireworks.

The Queen's Wedding. \u2014 On February 10th, 1840, her Majesty was united to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The leading inhabitants of Woolwich met in the schoolroom on the 7th to prepare an address to Prince Albert in the event of his expected landing at this place ; but the opportunity was denied them. The wedding-day was, however, celebrated in the most joyous manner. The Commodore's residence at the Dockyard was illuminated by coloured lamps, and a splendid display of fireworks took place on the Barrack Field. The Royal Artillery Barracks was not illuminated, except the west wing, which was occupied by the 29th Regiment ; the most effective display was made by the Royal Sappers and Miners, at their barracks in New Road. The Royal Marine Barracks was also splendidly lighted up. The Queen and Prince Albert.\u2014 On the 4th of May, 1840, Prince Albert reviewed the troops at Woolwich, and inspected the Royal Arsenal ; and in July, 1841, her Majesty the Queen, accompanied by her Consort, attended one of the grandest reviews the garrison has ever witnessed. This event is quaintly illustrated in a popular broadsheet which I have ventured to give in reduced form as a species of curiosity.

There were, however, some grand illuminations in the town. Over the main entrance of the Royal Arsenal the words \" Art, Peace, Plenty, Science,\" appeared in jets of gas, surmounted by a scroll and a crescent, and supported by the royal initials on either side. The house of Mr. G. H. Graham, in Brewer Street, was splendidly illuminated in lines of light, and decorated with flags. The steamboats and railway brought crowds of people home from London until half-past three next morning. 1 2 y 4 5 G 7 SO 1. Officer Royal Marines. 2. Private ,, \u201e 3. Drummer ,, ,, 4.

The officers were termed\" the \" Corps of Royal Engineers;' with uniform similar to the Sappers, but with a cocked hat and white leather instead of the shako. The dress of the enrolled Pensioners was unique, and quite different from the style universal with the rest of the army.

It was more gaudy, and also much more uncomfortable. The Royal Horse Artillery uniform has altered less, the jacket being still worn, but the old pattern was more heavily braided, both back and front, with five rows of buttons on the breast, and the waist was encircled with a red and yellow sash or girdle, from which depended two red cords on the right side. The busby was broad at the top, the red bag was larger, and the plume shorter than at present, while the \" lines \" were red, like the bag. The Royal Artillery all wore the '\u25a0 coatee \" with swallow tails in full dress, scarlet cuffs and collars, and yeUow worsted fringed epaulettes on the shoulders. The gunners had white belts, and the pouch (carried below the waistbelt) was also white, with a crown in the centre of the flap. The head-piece was a black shako, with peak \" fore and aft,\" ornamented with a brass plate and white plume. The bayonet was of the usual infantry pattern, with a black leather sheath. The greatcoat was carried roUed on the top of the knapsack. Tbe dress ofthe officers was similar, but with gold lace on cuffs and collars, and gold bul lion epaulettes ; a crimson silk sash was worn round the waist, the ends hanging on the right side. Sergeants also wore gold-fringed epaulettes and a crimson waist sash. The Band was more plainly dressed than now, having only a little gold lace on cuff--, collars, and skirts, and they wore the Grenadier bear-skin busby with red plume at the side. But they had a Drum Major then, and he was a gorgeous individual. He had a splendid red feather going right over the top of his busby. His coatee, which was scarlet until about 1850, was heavily laced on the breast : he had a rich scarlet and gold sash across his left shoulder, and the usual crimson one round the waist ; gold epaulettes on his shoulders, and a noble staff in his hand. The drummers and trumpeters wore yellow wings on the shoulders instead of epaulettes, and until about 1850 they wore scarlet coats. The officer's undress was a plain blue frock-coat with brass scales on the shoulders and crimson silk waist sash : blue cap with peak and gold band. The undress of the rank and file was a blue jacket with plain scarlet collar ; blue cap with red band round it. About 1850, grey or light blue trousers were abolished, and the present pattern substituted. County Review. \u2014 The great county review,* at Woolwich, on Friday, July 22nd, 1864, is an historical event which ought not to be passed over in silence. There were multitudes of visitors, and a very good show. The Lord-Lieutenant (Viscount (Sydney) distributed the shooting prizes, which included two silver cups given by the people of Woolwich, and a sham tight took place on the Common and Barrack Field, the corps engaged being the Royal Artillery, Royal Marines, and all the county volunteers, in the list of which appears the 14th Kent Artillery, the old Dockyard battalion, f The total field state was 7,000 men.

Soldiers have no special delight in the hardships and the jeopardies of active service. Among the most painful memories of our bravest men are \u2014 The tumult of the sacked and burning village, The shout that every prayer for mercy drowns, The victor's revels in the midst of pillage, The wail of famine in beleaguered towns ; The bursting shell, the gateway rent asunder, The rattling musketry, the dashing blade, And, ever and anon, in tones of thunder, The diapason of the cannonade. Longfellow. E E"], [86, "430 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Indeed, some of the most interesting of our records are connected with the more domestic side of the soldier's existence. Let us take the rise and progress of the famous Artillery Band. From 1810 until 184G, George McKenzie was the bandmaster, and did much to make it what it now is. It was he who introduced singing into the perfor mances of the band, giving glees, &c, in the R. A. messroom and at concerts in the town. Colonel Quist was at that time the zealous patron of the band, and to McKenzie, Quist suggested that some boys should be obtained to sing the treble parts. Four lads were then attached to the band, and an officer who took an interest in the movement informed McKenzie that there was a recruit in the Horse Artillery Square who ought also to be secured on account of his splendid bass voice. Sims Reeves. \u2014 Thus became attached to the R. A. band the man who was known as Corporal John Reeves, whose son is Sims Reeves, known for many years as the \"first tenor in Europe.\" Young Sims was attached to the band when he was eight or ten years old, and application was made to have him enlisted, but an objection was raised on account of the number of lads who had a prior claim, and when, a year later, authority came for the boy to join the army, he had been taken away for a better fate by a clergyman at Footscray, where his father then resided, having been discharged from the regiment in 1843. He died in 18G1. A great quantity of music, written by the hand of Corporal Reeves, is preserved in the Royal Artillery Library. His distinguished son* was born in the married soldiers' quarters immediately opposite the stage entrance of the Theatre in the Royal Artillery Barracks, at that time the Garrison Church. The Royal Artillery Band has produced other good musicians, if none so eminent as Sims Reeves, and has had a succession of talented conductors : \u2014 Royal Artillery Bandmasters. 1780.

The Mounted Band.\u2014 The Royal Artillery Mounted Band, which was disestablished and broken up quite recently, had its origin in a party of bugle-boys, taught simple marching tunes upon their bugles by Mr. James Lawson, who was solo-cornet in the Royal Artillery Band, afterwards Trumpet-Major, and ultimately bandmaster of the famous Mounted Band. It was at the close of the Crimean AVar (1856) that Sir W. Fenwick Williams, the Hero of Ears, on being appointed * Sims Reeves is the subject of another notice (see page 210)."], [87, "431 WOOLWICH. Commandant at Woolwich, decided to have a second regimental band, and he selected Mr. Lawson to form it. It was known, for distinction, as the \" brass band.\" At first it numbered but twenty-four members, but proved so serviceable that Mr. Lawson was, in 18-57, detached from the elder band to devote himself entirely to his new charge. The introduction by him of the chromatic bugle was another step, and in 1877, when increased to sixty members, it was ordered to do duty as a mounted band, making its first appearance on horseback on the Queen's birthday of that year. Horses were provided for forty-two members, the whole having brass instruments, headed by two pairs of kettle drums, with richly-laced banners. It was the largest mounted band in the British army, and always held a conspicuous place in the Lord Mayor's show. Its merits as an orchestra were also esteemed, aud it is said to bave been the only band in this country which has, with military instruments alone, performed the symphonies of Haydn and Beethoven. Dissolution. \u2014 In 1886-7 the Mounted Band came to a premature end. The Duke of Cambridge determined upon having a band for the Royal Artillery at Aldershot, and twenty-eight of the Mounted Band were, in the autumn of 1S86, lopped off for that purpose. At the same time Mr. Lawson took his retirement, and the remnant of the band struggled on at Woolwich under Sergeant-Major Anderson until the middle of 1887, when it was finally broken up and absorbed. Several of the members were transferred to the old regimental band, which was forthwith ordered to provide a new mounted band from out of its own ranks. Trophies. \u2014 In front of the south arch of the Royal Artillery Barracks, where the bands play nearly every summer morning, is the great Bhurtpoor gun. This interesting trophy was confided by King George IV. to the care of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers in 1828, it having been then presented to his Majesty by Viscount Combermere and the troops engaged with him in the assault and capture of Bhurtpoor. From the inscriptions upon the gun, it appears to have been made a.d. 1677. It weighs 17| tons, is 16 feet 4 inches long, and has a bore of 8 inches. The King elected the site as \u2014 \u25a0 \"A public and conspicuous situ ation for this splendid memorial of enterprise and gallantry, and also in order to place it in charge The Bhurtpoor Gun. of a body of men which had in so eminent a degree merited his Majesty's attach ment and approbation.\"\u2014 Letter in Adjutant-General's Office, Woolwich. ee2"], [88, "RECORDS OP THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 432 Crimean Memorial.\u2014 A worthy companion of the Bhurtpoor gun is the Crimean Memorial, a statue of Victory in the act of crowning her heroes with laurels. It was cast from cannon captured at Sebas topol in 1855, and is an admirable work of art. On the front of the pedestal are the words : \u2014 Honour to the Dutiful and Brave. And on a shield in rear, the following inscription : \u2014 Erected by their Comrades, to the Memory of the Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Men of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, who fell during the War with Russia, in the years 1854, 1855, and 1856. Consecration of Woolwich Garrison Church (St. George's) Nov. 2, 1863, Garrison Church. \u2014 To complete, as far as may be needful in this place, the records of the Royal Artillery Barracks, there remains the Garrison Church of St. George, which stands upon the Barrack Field, and, though it has neither tower nor spire, is essentially a noble edifice. Until 1863, when this church was consecrated (November 2nd), the troops attended divine service in the old Barrack Church \u2014 that part of the Royal Artillery Barracks which was originally the officers' mess and is now the Soldiers' Theatre and Recreation Rooms. The central"], [89, "WOOLWICH. 433 window in front of the church is dedicated to the memory of Lord Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, under whose direction it was built, and nearly all the other windows are filled with stained glass in honour of officers who formerly belonged to the regiment. The building cost \u00a316,000. Theatre and Recreation Booms. \u2014 Before the old church or Barrack Chapel, as it was sometimes called, was vacated and converted into the present elegant theatre and reading-rooms, it was customary to give occasional dramatic entertainments in the Riding School, where a stage was fitted up at the west end, having for the curtain a canvas picture of the Bay of Naples, which afterwards did similar duty in the new theatre for twenty-four years, when a fire broke out in the roof of the building and damaged both the curtain and the scenery past repair. To convert the chapel into the theatre required but slight structural alterations, and the transformation was ac complished at a moderate cost. The possession of so admirable a stage has greatly encouraged dramatic talent in this Garrison, and been the means of affording infinite amusement to the military and their friends. The place has always been well managed by a com mittee of officers, and manj7 notable entertainments have been given here, amongst which the Wednesday con certs of the Royal Artillery Band claim first mention. Ever since 1872, the non- Lord Herbert of Lea. commissioned officers have produced a yearly pantomime, which it has been the rule to begin on Boxing Night, and play nightly for a season, which has of late years run to a month.

Commissariat and Transport. \u2014 Brief mention has been made of the old \"Artillery Hospital,\" erected soon after the Barracks, namely in April, 1780, \" on a plot approved by the Surgeon-General \" between the Barracks and Cholick Lane. Origin and Vicissitudes. \u2014 The corps which now has its quarters in the old hospital is the modern and perfected embodiment of the army transport system, which in this, as in other countries, has had a chequered experience. The Waggon Train organized during the Penin- sular War having been dissolved during the subsequent long peace, it was resolved, on the breaking out of the Crimean Campaign in 1854, to raise a Land Transport Corps under the command of Colonel McMurdo. It consisted of twelve battalions, four troops to each battalion, and fifty men per troop. The pay was 2s. 6d. a day and rations. The Land Transport Corps was reorganized in 1856, when the war had ended, under the title ofthe \" Military Train,\" with twenty-four troops or companies, under the command of Colonel Clark Kennedy, and, in 1868, of Colonel George Erskine. On the formation of the Control Department in 1870, the Transport Service was amalgamated with the Commissariat and Military Staff Store Corps, and designated \"The Army Service Corps.\" It consisted of twelve companies for Transport,"], [94, "436 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. and ten for Supply and Ordnance Service, all under the Surveyor-General of the Ordnance ; but on the breaking up of the Control Department in 1876, the Transport and Supply branches were separated from the Ordnance Store Department, though still remaining under the Surveyor- General of the Ordnance. The Transport Companies were increased to sixteen in 1878. In 1881, the title \"Army Service Corps\" was abolished, and the names of \" Commissariat and Transport \" and \" Ord- nance Store \" Corps respectively given to the two branches, the former being placed under the Commander-in-Chief, with the Commissary- General at headquarters as commanding officer, the latter remaining under the Surveyor- General of the Ordnance. The Transport and Supply then consisted of twenty-one companies, and the corps served with distinction in all the recent campaigns. After all the changes the old title of \" Army Service Corps \" was restored, to every- one's satisfaction, early in 1889. Special pains have been taken to make the regiment efficient. Officers of other branches are encouraged to join it, the men are selected for good character, and the corps has many advantages for steady well-conducted soldiers of education, who receive extra pay, according to the duties performed. The Depot Companies are stationed at Woolwich and Aldershot, but their head quarters are in London, where the records are kept. -Revolt. \u2014 One of the most remarkable incidents in the local chronicles of this corps occurred in 1870. In the early part of the year, the Military Train were in process of conversion into the Army Service Corps, and all the men available and willing were transferred from the one to the other, save that the opportunity was taken to weed out the bad charac ters together with those who were medically rejected. Consequently the discontented ones made up a considerable tribe in the military Cave of Adullam. \"While awaiting their discharge, these men became impatient and restive, and complained of various small indignities. They were the black sheep of the flock, and there was probably little love between them and their officers and comrades. They declared that they had to do double stable-duty, that their rations were insufficient, that their barrack rooms were unclean, and that they had been unduly mulct of their pay. For several days the soreness increased, and at last, on the morning of Friday, March 4th, 1870, the whole of the disaffected men flew into open rebellion. Some broke out of bar racks, declaring that they were soldiers no longer, and the rest refused, either by orders, remonstrances, or threats, to do any more work. The military police were sent for, and the mutineers then retreated to their rooms, and began to smash the furniture and crockery, throwing the fragments out of the windows. Thirty of the military police sufficed to bar the rebels in, and then the gates were held while help was obtained from the Royal Artillery Barracks. The Commandant, Sir David Wood, sent a hundred men, and the barracks were scoured for the malcontents, but it was thought necessary to secure only twenty of the ringleaders and march them off to tbe main guard. Some were under the influence of drink, and the whole appeared to be of a low class. Ten others were afterwards arrested in the town, and on the fol lowing day a Garrison Court of Inquiry investigated the unfortunate business. The prisoners were allowed full latitude in making their defence, and brought forward a"], [95, "WOOLWICH. 437 series of hardships, alleging that they had been marked men ever since they were ordered for discharge, and subjected to many forms of injustice and indignity, for which, as no one would listen to their wrongs, they had no remedy but the \" demon stration \" to which they had been driven. These allegations were denied, but it cer tainly appeared that at Aldershot and other stations the men cast for discharge had been at once relieved from all duty, while at Woolwich they had not only to continue duty, but, owing to the pressure of work in the Royal Arsenal, the drivers had not had their meals either so well prepared or so regularly served as they might have been. On the morning of the riot they found their crockery, &c, uncleansed from the last meal, there being no one to clean up, and then, they said, they \"just went out to get their breakfasts.\" An indulgent report went up from the Court of Inquiry to the War Office, and on March 16 the corps was broken up and the whole ofthe prisoners were released and discharged from the army. The mutiny was entirely forgiven ; the men were presented with their New Zealand medals as though nothing had occurred, and their characters wero recorded on their certificates irrespective of the emeute. Each man was given his clothing, great- coat, and a sovereign, and his fare was paid, as is customary, to his destination. Guard Mounting. \u2014 Much of the duty which formerly fell upon the Royal Artillery now devolves upon the Transport Corps, especially in the Royal Arsenal, where also the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Commissariat branch are usefully employed in such avocations as correspond in times of peace with the work which they have to do on active service in the field. We have recently been reminded of a heavy and irksome obligation which at one time rested upon the garrison in having to furnish the Dockyard and Arsenal guards, since gradually and totally superseded by the police. Guard mounting was a daily ceremony on the parade in front of the Royal Artillery Barracks, and usually attracted many spectators. About a hundred and fifty artillerymen were told off to act as sentries about the Arsenal, and a hundred marines were similarly employed in the Dockyard. The garrison guards also were stronger and more numerous than now, and the idea of useful employment for military labour had hardly begun to be understood. The ceremony has been thus described by a recent writer in the Kentish Independent : \u2014 Soon after 10 a.m. the troops detailed for guard duty assembled on the Barrack Field, and were formed in line facing the barracks, the Royal Artillery on the right, and the Royal Marines (or Militia) on the left. The bands in garrison used to attend in turn, a week at a time. When the clock struck half-past ten, the line was called to attention by the field officer for the day. The band stood on the right of the line, facing to the left, while the officers and non-commissioned officers in charge of the different guards were posted some fifty paces in front, and, while the band played a slow step, they marched slowly and solemnly, with.recovered arms, up to the line. The band then marched along the front of the line from right to left playing a slow march, halting at the left flank, facing about, and returning to their original"], [96, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 438 , \u2022 -i i ti,o linp then broke in open column and marched nn cbed off to heir destinations, the Artillery Band playing their men down to the t ena 1 y way of New Road and Green's End, while the Marines, headed by their band made heir way down Frances and Henry Streets to the Dockyard. While the Ss we bring hanged aud sentries posted, the bands played inside the Arsenal and Dockvard, afterwards playing the old guards back to barracks, which they gene- rallv reached shortly before 12 o'clock. The Hero of Kars.\u2014 One of the most memorable of the occasions in which the military and the civil sides of Woolwich mutually shared was that of Thursday, July 3, 1856, when Major-General Sir William Fenwick Williams, the hero of Kars, was received by the inhabitants with a hearty welcome on his return home and his ap pointment as Commandant of the garrison. The Local Board of Health took the affair heartily in hand, and built stands and platforms at the top of Hill Street, where a number of ladies, the Royal Artillery band, &c, were accommodated. Charlton put out its ban ners, and Woolwich was gay with bunting down Artillery Place, it having been arranged that the gal lant General should drive from London and enter the Royal Artillery Barracks at the north arch. The members of the Local Board stood under a canopy and wore rosettes of the national Sir W. Fenwick Williams, of Kars. \" red, white, and blue,\" and a great and enthusiastic crowd filled every available place. At a few minutes to four the General arrived in his carriage; Mr. Morgan, the chairman of the Board, read an address of wel come and congratulation, and Sir W. Fenwick Williams in reply spoke with pride of the long connection of his ancestry and himself with the town of Woolwich. Mrs. Geo. Hall Graham then presented a bou quet and made a little speech, to which the gallant General gallantly responded.

The staff- sergeants and sergeants of each corps gave an annual ball, and invitations were lavishly distributed all round. That of the Royal Marines took place between decks of the model ship in rear of their barracks, while the non-coms, of the Royal Artillery were permitted to make use of the regimental schoolrooms on Green Hill, draped and festooned with the utmost industry and skill. The"], [98, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 440 artist to whom we are indebted for this sketch of a scene enacted on January 7, 1859, says : \u2014 The coup d'\u0153il afforded by a room filled with more than three hundred brilliant and varied uniforms and beautiful ladies in ball costume, was magnificent in the ex treme. The ball was honoured by the presence of Sir W. F. Williams, Bart., K.C.B., M.P., Commander of the garrison ; Colonel Teesdale, R.H.A., commanding Field Artillery, and lady ; Colonel Bingham, Deputy Adjutant- General, R.A., and lady ; Colonel Francklyn and lady ; Colonel Benn, Royal Artillery ; Captain Denne, Ad jutant, R.H.A., and several commanding officers and adjutants of brigades and batal lions. A number of staff-sergeants and sergeants, with two, and some three, medals on their breasts, were present, and their bronzed and scarred visages showed that, although well fitted to do their \" devoirs \" in the ball-room, sterner scenes were not unfamiliar to them. Dancing was carried on with great spirit until six o'clock the following morning. Sergeant Hedley, who officiated as master of the ceremonies, rendered most valuable assistance in preventing confusion and in keeping the ball moving with vigour and grace ; and the unceasing exertions of Sergeant-Major Lee, president ; Sergeant James Russell, R.A., the secretary ; and Sergeant Samuel Macartney, R.A., contributed greatly to the pleasure and enjoyment of the guests. Sappers and Miners. \u2014 For sixty years the Royal Engineers had their headquarters at Woolwich. The regiment, like its sister, the Royal Artillery, was of humble origin, but its source is well estab lished. The \" Corps of Military Artificers \" was formed at Gibraltar in 1772. It consisted of 1 sergeant as adjutant, 3 other sergeants, 3 corporals, 60 privates, and 1 drummer, and it was designated \" The Soldier Artificer Company.\" In 1787, there were five companies, one of which was located in Woolwich. The status of the corps, then known as \" The Royal Military Artificers,\" was at the same time defined by an order to parade on the left of the Royal Artillery. Officers of the Royal Engineers commanded them. In 1795, Woolwich became the headquarters. In 1798, when the country was threatened by France, the Woolwich Company voluntarily and unanimously gave three days' pay to help the State. The corps grew in numbers continually, and in 1811, it consisted of 2,861 non-commissioned officers and men, the officers still being \" Engineers\" and quite distinct from them. The School of Engineering was formed at Chatham in 1812 by Lord Mulgrave, Master- General, and it was he who, on the 4th of August in the same year, changed the title of the corps to \" The Royal Sappers and Miners.\" Until January, 1856, however, the Royal Sappers and Miners remained in their old quarters at the lower barracks in New Road, and then they were taken to Chatham, and their title again changed to that of \" The Royal Engineers.\" The full history of the corps is given in Connolly's \" Sappers and Miners,\" from which I extract the following items : \u2014 Sir John Sinclair, Bart, enlisted as a sapper in 1812 in the name of John Smith"], [99, "WOOLWICH. 441 His attainments and good conduct soon led to his promotion to second corporal, and he was provided with quarters at the main guard, Royal Arsenal. His lady some times visited him, but his rank was unsuspected for about a year, when he was arrested at Woolwich by his creditors and taken to the Fleet prison, where he lav for eighteen months. In 1813 Sergeant Millar was in charge of the guard at the Sappers Barracks, Woolwich, and received from the officer in command the usual order, \" Sergeant, to your guard, march ! \" Thereupon Millar hurled his halbert in the air, and the pike, descending point first, stuck in the earth. At this moment, to complete the extravaganza, Millar pitched on his hands, and with his legs towering in the air, with all the steadiness of an acrobat paddled to his wondering guard. The corps did good service at the sieges during the war with France, but were not provided with firearms until 1817. While on the Continent they were made an example of the Duke of Wellington's discipline. A sapper named Milne was murdered and a party of his comrades were suspected, but the criminal could not be discovered. The Duke, however, convinced that the murderer was in the corps, ordered that all the Sappers and Miners with the army, and the officers attached, should parade every hour of every day from 4 in the morning until 10 at night, which was done, with only a slight relief, until the day they quitted France. Private James Gordon served as a sapper for nine years, and was discharged at Woolwich in 1820 on a pension of ninepence a day. In 1848 he succeeded his grand father in the rank of Viscount Kenmure and Lord Lochinvar. In 1S32, by royal command, the Sappers and Miners took the Royal Artillery motto, Ubique quo fas et gloria ducunt. On the 9th of March, 1842, one hundred and fifty men of the corps, under Lieut. Yorke, R.E., worked at a fire which broke out at the Bull Tavern and burnt it to the ground. The principal wall fell and crushed and wounded eighteen persons, of whom six were sappers. An insurance company gave \u00a3o to the regiment, which was spent in the purchase of the barrack clock. Severndroog Castle was in 1848-50 used as an observing station in conjunction with a crow's-nest on St. Paul's, and other observatories, for the great survey of London by the Royal Engineers. ' Two hundred and forty-seven men of the Royal Sappers and Miners were employed at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1853 Corporal MacDonald completed a sanitary survey of Woolwich for the Local Board of Health, who paid him \u00a3450. Evening Music. \u2014 The \" Sappers \" were a good deal missed when they left their old home at Woolwich, and the loss of the \" tattoo \" performance by the band in the Barrack Square, which had been the chief evening amusement of the townsfolk, was a serious deprivation. The band played for half an hour, and the public were admitted within the gates unrestrained. For some years afterwards, the band of the Royal Artillery gave a nightly musical performance during the summer months, from 9 to 9.30,"], [100, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 442 on the Barrack Field, and a popular promenade was thus established, but came to an end about 1866. The Engineers attended divine service on Sundays in the Ordnance Church, Plumstead Road, the band playing to and fro. It consisted wholly of brass instruments. Owing to the long period during which the corps has been associated with Woolwich, it has left many of its old members and their descendants among the settled population. Since the removal of the corps, there have been located in the garrison only the small establishments connected with the Royal Engineer office in Mill Lane, and the Inspector of Works' Department in \u00b0the Royal Arsenal. The Commanding Royal Engineer has, however, always been an officer of importance to both town and garrison, and to the holders of that appointment, at various times, some valuable improvements in the public thoroughfares have been due.

DISTINGUISHED SOLDIERS. Gordon. \u2014 AVoolwich has necessarily been associated with the lives of many famous soldiers. The name of General Gordon, the hero of Khartoum, will naturally first occur to the mind in this connection, but the storv of the immortal Gordon is too well known, and withal too eventful and complex, to be fitly presented in these pages. His Youth. \u2014 Many biographies of our great Christian warrior have been written ; and I select from the narrative by his brother, Sir Henry Gordon* merely the passages which describe his early life at Wool wich. Charles George Gordon, son of General Gordon, was the fourth son out of a family of eleven children. He was born at No. 1, Kemp Terrace, Woolwich Common, on the 28th January, 1833, and, as a child, accompanied his father, first to the Pigeon House Fort, Dublin, then to Leith Fort, and in 1846 to Corfu. In 1843, Charles Gordon returned with his mother to England for the purpose of going to school at Taunton, where he remained until he entered the Royal Military Academy at Wool wich as a cadet in the year 1848. Charles Gordon's character in boyhood gave little indication of what the man was to be. He was far from being a quiet lad \u2014 was always up to any kind of fun, and had a turn for mischief. His father had been made director of the Carriage Depart ment in the Royal Arsenal upon his return from Corfu, and Charles Gordon, with a brother more unruly than himself, finding the time hang heavily upon their hands during the vacations, employed themselves in various ways. Their father's house was opposite to that of the Commandant of the garrison, and was overrun with mice. These were caught, the Commandant's door quietly opened, and the mice were trans ferred to new quarters. In after life, that is in 1879, when in the Soudan, Charles Gordon wrote to one of his nieces, who was born and Hved twenty years in the Royal Arsenal : \u2014 \" I am glad to hear the race of true Gordons is not extinct. Do you not regret the Arsenal and its delights ? You, never, any of you, made a proper use of the Arsenal workmen as we did. They used to neglect their work for our orders, and turned out some splendid squirts \u2014 articles that would wet you through in a moment. As fra the cross-bows we had made, they were grand with screws. One Sunday afternoon, * \" Events in the Life of Charles George Gordon,\" by Henry William Gordon, Lon don, 1886.

They were found to have been perforated with a small hole (ventilation !) and Captain Soady nearly escaped a premature death ; a screw passed his head, and was as if it had been revyed into the wall which it had entered. Servants were kept at the door with continual bell ringings. Tour Uncle Freddy (a younger brother) was pushed into \u2022houses, the bell rang, and the door held to prevent escape. Those were the days of the Arsenal.\" But what Charles Gordon considered as his greatest achievement was one that he Gordon's Birthplace, Woolwich Common. in after years, often alluded to. At this time, 1848, the senior class of cadets, then called the Practical Class, were located in the Royal Arsenal, and in front of their halls of study there were earthworks, upon which the}7 practised from time to time in profiling and in other matters. The \" ins and outs \" of these works were thoroughly well known to Charles Gordon and his brother, who stole out at night. But we will leave him to tell his own story. He sa}7s : \u2014 \u25a0 \" I forgot to tell \u2014 (his niece before alluded to) of how when Colonel John Travers of the Hill folk (he lived on Shooters' Hill) was lecturing to the Arsenal cadets in the evening, a crash was heard, and every one thought that every pane of glass was F E"], [106, "446 RECORDS OE THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. broken ; small shot had been thrown. However, it was a very serious affair, for, like the upsetting of a hive, the cadets came out, and only darkness, speed, and knowledge of the field-works thrown up near the lecture-room enabled us to escape. The culprits; were known afterwards, and for some time avoided the vicinity of the cadets. That was before I entered the curriculum. I remember it with horror to this day (1879) for no mercy would have been shown by 'the Pussies,' as they (the cadets) were called.\" 184S. \u2014 As stated before, Charles Gordon now entered the Royal Military Academy, and he remained there until the 23rd of June, 1852. Although painstaking and a first-rate surveyor, and proficient in fortification, yet he was not at that time much of a mathematician, which delayed his progress. After he had been some time at the Academy, and earned many good-conduct badges, an occasion arose when it became necessary to restrain the cadets in leaving the dining-hall, the approach to which wa* by a narrow staircase. At the top of this staircase stood the senior corporal with outstretched arms, facing tbe body of cadets. This was too much for Charlie Gordon (as he was always called by his numerous friends), who, putting his head down, butted with it, and catching the officer in the pit of bis stomach, not only sent him down the stairs, but through the glass door beyond. The officer jumped up unhurt, and Charlie Gordon was placed in confinement, and nearly dismissed. He was, however, allowed to remain, though deprived of all his honours, and the captain of the cadet company (Eardley Wilmot*) predicted that he would never make an officer. Jipon another occasion in 1851, when he was near his commission, a great deal of bullying was going on, and, in order to repress it, a number of the last-comers were questioned, when one of them said that Charlie Gordon had, on one occasion, hit him over the head with a clothes-brush. The lad admitted it was not a severe blow ; nevertheless, Charlie Gordon was, for this slight offence, put back six months for his commission, which turned out well in the end, since it secured for him a second lieutenancy in the Royal Engineers in place of the Royal Artillery. Here we cease to follow the life of Gordon, which is henceforward a record of the achievements known to all mankind in the story of \" The Hero of Khartoum.\" Gordon died a martyr's death on .January 26th, 1885, the brightest example of a devoted Christian soldier in the Records of the World. For where religion doth with virtue join, It makes a hero like an angel shine. Prince Arthur. \u2014 In one prominent member of Woolwich garrison the inhabitants of all grades and conditions for many years claimed an equal interest. It is a little strange that, familiar as the town and garrison are with the presence of Royalty, we are unable to chronicle the residence here within our time of any scion of the English reigning family save that of his Royal Highness Prince Arthur, Duke of Con naught, &c. Prince Arthur, however, has resided at Woolwich not only once, but several times, and it may perhaps be said that he has manifested a partiality for the old headquarters of the Royal Artilllery which was only to be expected of one trained, as he was, a \" gunner.\" * Afterwards General Eardley Wilmot, who reckoned Charles Gordon as one of his greatest friends."], [107, "PLATE L.

Prince Arthur received the members of the Board at the Ranger's House, and, the address having been read by Mr. W. P. Jackson, chair man of the Board, His Royal Highness replied as follows : \u2014 Gentlemen,\u2014 Your address reminds me of the number of years that have passed since I first took up my residence in this neighbourhood, and it recalls many varied associations, the recollections of which will ever remain vividly impressed on my memory.

While, therefore, deeply impressed myself by what you have said, it is unnecessary for me to assure you how gratifying the expressions will be to my dear mother, the Queen.\" In 1873, the lst battalion of the Rifle Brigade left Woolwich, but his Royal Highness, now Duke of Connaught, w7as transferred, on promotion, to the 3rd battalion of the same regiment, and came to Woolwich once more in command of that battalion from Shorncliffe, on May the 23rd, 1877. Tho officers' quarters being thought unsuitable, his Royal nighness resided at a house (No. 1, Bowater Crescent) opposite the Cambridge Barracks. Counting his cadetship, this was the Prince's fourth service at Woolwich, and he remained again for about two years, since which his increasing duties in various parts of the Queen's dominions have enabled him to pay his military Alma Hater only occasional visits. The Coffee Tavern. \u2014 One of these was especially memorable, for it was the day when his Royal Highness laid the foundation-stone of the Duke of Connaught Coffee Tavern and Royal Assembly Rooms, an estab lishment which has been of much value and importance to the town. The date recorded on the stone is October 30th, 1880. Previous to this he had, in company with the Duchess of Connaught, presided at the opening of the Royal Albert Docks (June 24th, 1880), and from these same docks, on Sunday, July 30th, 1882, he took his departure for the successful campaign against Arabi, in Egypt, the Prince and Princess of Wales, Prince Albert Victor, Prince George, the Duke of Edinburgh, Duchess of Connaught, and Duke of Cambridge, being present to bid him farewell. It was an exciting adieu, which no one who witnessed it will ever forget. The battle of Tel-el-Kebir, on September 13th, brought the crusade to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion, and the Duke was excluded from the second and more disastrous war in Egypt, only by the important command which he had undertaken in India, probably the most serious service of his honourable, gallant, and exemplary life. The Prince Imperial. \u2014 -Amongst its many historical associations, Woolwich is also bound up in the short, eventful history of the ill-fated Prince Imperial. Born heir to a famous name and a mighty throne, he shared the pomp and glory, the fall and the exile of the Emperor who, whatever were his sins and misfortunes, will ever rank as one of the grand monarchs of France. Driven from his home and country, it was at Woolwich the Prince was placed for his education ; it was at Woolwich that he resided for several years ; and it was at Woolwich his dead body was landed, and received by the nation in whose cause he had died, to be borne in sorrow and tears to his broken-hearted mother at Chisel hurst."], [111, "PLATE LI.

He came of a good family in Denmark and saw much fighting before he joined the English army under King William III. in 1692, when he was thirty three years old. He was as skilful as he was brave, and, besides being present at forty-two battles, in wliich he was several times wounded, has left a record of many improvements in artillery. He was the first Colonel-Commandant of the regiment, and died in 1751, aged ninety-two years. His portrait is in the Royal Artillery mess-room, and he worthily occupies his position at the head of the Artillery list. His plan of the Royal Arsenal (or Warren) is the earliest extant (1701). f He was present at the Moorfields explosion in 1716. General William Belford entered the Royal Artillery in 1726, and did a soldier's work in memorable campaigns.

He also founded the gunpowder factory at Waltham Abbe}'. His son, the second Sir William Congreve (also called by courtesy Colonel Congreve), invented the Congreve rocket, and succeeded his father as head of the Laboratory and Super intendent of Military Machines at Woolwich.* Major Stephen Payne Adye is the author of a well-known work on Courts martial, and served as Brigade-Major in the Royal Artillery in the American war, but retired in 1790, and is principally remarkable as the first of a name which has been continuously represented in the regiment since he joined in 1757. * The following anecdote of the second Congreve is found in the United Service Journal of 1829 : During the late war, when the Royal Horse Artillery was formed his late Majesty was at a Woolwich review, when a distinguished German said the guns were not fired fast enough, and Congreve replied that he would try to make them go faster. Some weeks later, when the German was again present, two new guns were paraded and fired, the one thirty and the other twenty-eight rounds per minute Everybody was amazed excepting Congreve and the others who were in the secret He had bored a small hole through the cascabel of each gun into the powder chamber and into this he put a red-hot iron rod. Two men stood by the muzzle with car tridges fixed on small sticks, by which they were enabled to throw the charges one after another into the guns, which, being elevated, promptly brought the powder into contact with the iron rod and caused the explosion. As soon as the minute expired the guns limbered up and were galloped away without waiting for inspections and the foreigner never discovered the trick."], [119, "WOOLWICH. 453 General Sir Thomas Blomefield was in the navy before he joined the Wool wich Academy. In the Royal Artillery his dual experience was of advantage in several campaigns. In 1780 he was made Inspector of Artillery at the Gun Foundry Woolwich, and created a great stir by his close surveillance of the work, condemning four hundred and ninety-six pieces of ordnance at proof in his first year.

The first officer not of the Royal Artillery who was head of a department in Royal Arsenal. Of the Royal Marines, though its connection with the garrison was comparatively short, there would be no difficulty in making a long list of heroes. One of the most famous in his day was \u2014 General Sir John Douglas, Royal Marines, who died at Greenwich, and is buried in a vault at Charlton Church. He had a distinguished career, commencing at the age of thirteen. Gre^t honour was paid at his decease, which was in 1814. There were also in the days of the Dockyard many distinguished naval men asso- ciated at some time of their lives with AAroolwich, but there are none who call for special reference. The following naval officer has, however, an important connection with the Government works of the present day : Captain Frank Campbell Younghusband, R.N., son of General Younghus- band, R.A. (formerly Superintendent of Royal Gun Factories), joined as naval cadet in 1864, and attained the rank of Commander in 1885. AVas Assistant-Secretary oi the Ordnance Select Committee, 1886-7 ; then appointed to supervise naval \"un fittings, a id in March, 1888, made Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories, being the first naval officer who ever held a prominent position in any of the Ordnance Factories. He has the Egyptian medal, having been gunnery lieutenant of the Inflexible at the bombardment of Alexandria. A few of the Ordnance Department must also be mentioned. Major-General Matthew J. T. Ingram, Assis. Com. Gen., 1880 (previous departmental service twenty-five years); Com. General Woolwich Arsenal, 188S; served in New Zealand War, 1861-3-5 ; and operations in Japan, 1864.

Gen. 18S0 (previous departmental service twenty-four years) ; served in Egyptian Expedition, 1882-4 ; Deputy Com. Gen., 1888. William Sturgeon, a gunner in the Royal Artillery, was remarkable for his scientific researches. He sounded the Woolwich Literary Society in 1822, at which time he had retired on a small pension, and had a bootmaker's shop in Artillery Place, at the spot where now stands the post-office kept by Mrs. Cattermolc. He afterwards became etlitor of the London Philosophical Magazine, lecturer in G G"], [128, "462 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT, science and philosophy at the Royal Military College, Addiscombe ; and subseepiently president of the Royal Victoria Institute at Manchester. Peter McKinlay, one of Sturgeon's pupils at the Woolwich Literary Society, joined the Royal Artillery in 1829, and applied himself diligently to scientific studies, especially to electricity. In 1846 he was selected for the post of sergeant-superin tendent of the then newly-formed Royal Artillery Institution, and, having acquired the art of printing at Mr. Boddy's establishment in Artillery Place, he founded in 1S48 the Institution Printing-office, where he remained until 1855, greatly encouraged by General Sir Henry Lefroy. On quitting the Institution he was made Proof-master at the Royal Arsenal with a salary of \u00a3360 a year, and amongst his inventions was the application of galvanic agency to the firing of guns, for which the Government presented him with ,\u00a3100. He also invented the plan of taking impressions of the bores of guns by means of gutta-percha, and introduced an automatic process of photographing the flight of projectiles. He retired in 1877, at the age of seventy years, and died in Upper AVhitworth Road, Shooters' Hill, on the 26th of January, 1888, in his eighty-first year. The Royal Artillery Family. \u2014 Mr. James Browne, author of \" England's Artillerymen,\" &c,* compares the list of Artillery officers to a genealogical table, and quotes as a literal truth the observation of General Sir Edward Warde that the corps is one family. I take the following extracts from a bundle of notes which Mr. Browne has generously sent me: \u2014 Fathers, sons, grandsons, and even great-grandsons have successively appeared as artillery officers, and many of the same names are to be found in 1760, 1800,1850 and 1880. General Borgard's son died a captain, and his nephews, George and Borgard Michelson, both served in the regiment. General Pattison, who married Borgard's daughter Mary, was a prolific godfather, if we may judge from James Pattison Adye, James Pattison Cockburn, James Pattison St. Clair, &c. There have been seven Adyes in the Royal Artillery. In 1S14, Lieutenant AV. Robe, who rose from the ranks, his son, Col. Sir Wm. Robe, and his grandson, Lieut. W. L. Robe, were all serving in the regiment at one time. Capt. Reeves, who was killed at Gibraltar, had a daughter married to Lieut.-Col. G. Scott. Scott's daughter married General Campbell, and was mother of Sir Fredk. Campbell, whose son, Major F. W. Camp bell, is now serving. Of 4,020 officers who, up to the end of 1880, had served in the Royal Artillery, only 129 have become Colonels-Commandant -the highest regimental rank \u2014 while 103 have been killed in action, 23 have been drowned, 40 have met with other violent deaths, 89 have died of disease in India, and 143 in the West Indies.

A Military Burns. \u2014 To lighten a chapter laden with dates and figures, it may conclude with a notice of Robert Graham, a son of \" Caledonia stern and wild,\" who in the year 1819 was a private in the Royal Artillery at \"Woolwich. In a fit of home sickness the poetic frenzy seized him, and he sent to the Honourable Board of Ordnance a petition for his discharge in eight stanzas and in this strain : \u2014 I've served my king in peace an' war, BppUi free o' scaith an' free o' scar ; An' nowr wi'out me I'm awar' He weel could ring O'er his domains both near an' far In peace a king.

Impressed by this appeal the Honourable Board replied (in prose) that the petitioner's name was noted, and that at the first opportunity his discharge would be granted. But \" a weary twa months passed away,\" and poor Graham aroused the Board with a more urgent effusion, as per sample : \u2014 The very company I belang to Ha' let off chaps baith stout and strang too ; For God's sake there can be no wrang to Alen tion my name. * * * * Just twa, three words to AA'oolwich driven AA\"\"ould bring relief.

An Ancient Place. \u2014 Although that portion of Woolwich which lies on the northern side of the Thames may be said to have been uninhabited within the memory of the present generation, North \"Woolwich has a history, and a venerable history, of nearly eight hundred years. Wyck-lands. \u2014 In the \"Annals of Berniondsey,\" it is shown that in the year 1115 there was an estate of fifty acres in the parish of Woolwich, north of the Thames, but in the county of Kent, known as Wiklonds or Wyck-lands, the tithes of which belonged to the monks of Bermondsey; having been given to them by William de Eltham, the ill-fated son of Henry I. Theobald, Archbishop of Canter bury (11-38-1161), confirmed the gift. In 1.541 the same estate of Wyck-lands was granted to Sir Roger Cholmley by the monastery of Stratford Langthorne. Manor of Woolwich. \u2014 There was another estate in the North Woolwich Marshes, and also in Kent, consisting of n hundred acres, which at one time belonged to the Abbey of St. Mary Je Graces, near the Tower, being part of its Manor of Poplar, but afterwards came into possession of Sir John Pultenay, Lord of the Manor of Woolwich in 1328. These lands, which were leased in the reign of Henry VIII. to John Danyell, were granted in 1542 to Thomas Eaglesfield, and again in 1558 to Thomas Palmer and Andrew Castell. The Tile-house. \u2014 The Tile-house and another estate adjacent referred to in the following paragraph will help to account for about half the area of North Woolwich : \u2014 In 1340 Thomas de Harewold, citizen of London, granted to WiUiam Abbot, of"], [140, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 470 Stratford, and the convent of that place and their successors, in frank almoigne, .a toft and 15 acres of land lying in AVoolwich, on the north side of the Thames, which were formerly of William de Rokynham, with all arrears, of 8d., and one hen annually, arising from one messuage and half an acre of land, called the Tyle-house, in the same vill of Woolwich, which tenement his ancestors had held, from time out of mind, of the said Abbot and Convent, and their predecessors, as of the right of the Church of Stratford. The Old Ferry. \u2014 The Ferry between North Woolwich and Warren Lane was a -very ancient privilege : In 1308 a messuage and a ferry at AVoolwich were sold by William de AVicton to William Atte Halle, mason, for \u00a310. In 1320 Lambert de Trykenham conveyed 1 messuage, 50 acres land, 40 wood, 40 heath, and 14s. rent, in Woolwich and elsewhere, and a ferry across the Thames at Woolwich, to John Latynier and Joan his wife. In 1340 these lands, rent, and the ferry, were conveyed by William Filliol and Mary his wife to Thomas Harwold and his heirs, for 100 silver marks. A Royal Ferry. \u2014 Greenwich and Erith had ferries also, and their competition constituted a grievance for the Woolwich people, who petitioned Parliament in 1330 to suppress their rivals, because Wool wich Ferry was \"a Royal ferry farmed of the King,\" which probably means that it was an appurtenance of the Royal Manor of Eltham, as it certainly was.* Descent. \u2014 The prescriptive right of ferry between North and South Woolwich continued for hundreds of years, and exists still in the ferry from the Barge Home to Warren Lane. Another Ferry. \u2014 In 1811 an Act of Parliament (51 Geo. III., cap. 199) was passed for the purpose of establishing another ferry across the river Thames at Woolwich, from the Old Ballast or Sand Wharf, which was opposite Chapel Street, where the Dockyard then terminated. The proprietors of the new ferry were Dame Jane Wilson, widow, Sir Thomas Wilson, baronet, the Reverend Hugh Fraser, Thomas Bird, Nathaniel Randall, William Randall, William Limbery, Richard Powis, William Powis, John Cook, Sarah Blight, John Long, Thomas Mills, Joseph Meads Madkins, John Marriner Mase, Charles Hopkin son, Edmund Hopkinson, John Stride and Jacob James. The under taking was described as \u2014 A common ferry consisting of one or more boats, or such other vessels as shall be sufficient and proper for the passage and conveyance of persons, carriages, cattle, goods, wares and merchandise over and across the said river Thames, from or near a place called The Old Ballast or Sand Wharf, to the opposite shore in the parish of West Ham. * Eltham to this day holds the right of landing goods at Warren Lane."], [141, "471 WOOLWICH. Charlton Ferry. \u2014 Whether the ferry authorised by the Act of 1811 was ever set going at this spot is a matter of some doubt. I am disposed to think that the right of ferry which is at present located at Trinity Stairs is a survival of a far more ancient privilege enjoyed by the watermen of that quarter and of West Ham from immemorial time. Down to 1852 or later, the ferry stairs were beside an alehouse called the Marquis of Wellington* the site of which is near the centre of Siemen's Factory. My old directory shows that this house was kept in 1849 by William Clothier, and I remember that it had the reputa tion of being in early years the rendezvous of smugglers. Reference to the rough plan at page 60 will show the position proposed for the ferry in 1811. When that plan was drawn (about 1815) there was a landing place at the spot now indicated by John Street and the tall chimney. The road leading to it was afterwards stopped, and the only way of reaching it was by a detour round Trinity Street and along the bank. Charlton Pier. \u2014 The landing place just mentioned was established in 1781, and when the site was thrown into the Dockyard in 1842, it was removed to Trinity Street, where it became Charlton (or West Woolwich) Pier. The chief reason for thinking that the ferry at the Marquis of Wellington was of ancient origin is the undoubted existence of an old road leading from it through Hanging Wood to Shooters' Hill and Eltham. This may, indeed, have been the Royal Ferry before-mentioned, but the hereditary title of Eltham to the Warren Lane Causeway is rather in favour of the alternative theory. The road referred to crossed the strip of Trinity Marsh from the White Horse until about 1850, when it was stopped up and the Marquis of Wellington and the stairs demolished, f The few watermen who plied their vocation at the spot joined the few who had been driven westward by the Dockyard extensions to Trinity Street, and there they or their descendants remain to this day. Plans of the Bowater Estate dated 1820 have the road to the Marquis of Wellington marked: \u2014 \"To the Horse Ferry.\" Charlton (or West Woolwich) Pier was built by a combination of the watermen who settled in Trinity Street, but was sold with all the ferry rights to Mr. W. P. Jackson between twenty and thirty years since. The pier was removed in 1888 consequent on the depression of the steamboat trade. * The Marquis of Wellington cannot have been an ancient title, but the house may have been an old inn with a new sign. + A new road has just been made over the same ground."], [142, "472 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. Barge House Ferry. \u2014 The Barge House Ferry took courage as its rival receded from it and in 1839 (12th August) we read \u2014 The lessees of AVoolwich Ferry have within the last few weeks stationed here a new ferry boat of larger dimensions than any on the river, with a view of meeting the immense increase of traffic that has lately taken place between the two counties. Air. How, the proprietor of tbe Old Barge House, is constructing a wharf and esplanade \u2022xtending along the banks of the river 300 yards, the depth upwards of 130. The Arsenal Ferry. \u2014 A great part of the esplanade was absorbed in the Gardens, but a remnant still exists. Both ferries had professed to be of service to the Crown, but it happened that in 1811, the year in which the Act just mentioned was passed, the Government established its own ferry from the Royal Arsenal to North Woolwich, which they still retain. Here is the record in \" Lyson's Supplement\" of that year : \u2014 A military ferry has been established from the Royal Arsenal to Duvall's Point on the opposite side of the river, by which means artillery of every description can be immediately sent from the depot at AAroolwii:h intu any part of Essex, without going through London ; a new road having been made from the ferry to Romford. The Old Landing. \u2014 The ferry from Warren Lane had its landing place at the manorway on the west side of the Barge House until the Government made the causeway and road on the east side. A Ferry Company. \u2014 This ferry recently floated a public company, which proved that it had from time immemorial conveyed men, cattle and goods across to North AVoolwich from Warren Lane. About 1810 it was in possession of one John Bull, after whom it was worked by John Punter. Then George May of the Old Barge House had it for many years, and of late it had been held by John Fulford, a lighterman. The Free Ferry. \u2014 North Woolwich has the distinction of possess ing the first free ferry ever established in the kingdom. About 1850 proposals were made for superseding the ancient horse-raft by some steam communication, the prevailing idea being a flat-bottomed vessel grounding on the beach ; but nothing which could be called a move ment was seen for more than thirty years afterwards. On the 18th of October, 1880, a public meeting was held at the Town Hall, Woolwich, to advocate the establishment of such a ferry from local resources, and on the 22nd of March, 1881, a deputation of sixty tradesmen waited upon the Local Board to promote that object. The Board instructed their surveyor to prepare plans and estimates, but shrank from the costly undertaking, and then a serious endeavour was made to obtain a steam ferry as a gift from the Metropolis. At first the Metropolitan Board were disposed to ridicule the contentions of the inhabitants, who claimed the ferry as an equivalent for the money they had paid towards building and redeeming the bridges at the west end, but at length the"], [143, "473 W00LAVICH. claim prevailed and the Metropolitan Board consented to provide the ferry. This was in 1884, and in the session of 1885 statutory powers were obtained for the purpose. There was a wearisome delay of two years while arrangements were made for acquiring sites, and on the 30th of September, 1887, Messrs. Mowlem & Co. were entrusted with a contract to make the approaches, bridges and pontoons. The steamers had been previously ordered of Sir AV. G. Armstrong & Co., but in 1S88, when the inhabitants were anxiously looking for the ferry to open in tho spring, it was announced that the boats had not been begun, difficulties having arisen which eventually annulled the contract. Messrs. H. and R. Green, however, offered to build the steamers rapidly at their Thames Ironworks, and the Board accepted their contract for the two vessels at \u00a327,000 on the 9th of March, 1888. It was then promised that the ferry should be opened in the following November, but six months more were consumed in preparations, chiefly due to the obstacle offered by the chalky foreshore on the south side of the river, and finally Saturday, March 23rd, 1889, was fixed for the opening day. The rejoicings of that day were remarkably demonstrative, and it was truly said that Woolwich had never before made so much display. As it happened that the Metropolitan Board came to a premature end three days previously, the inauguration of their great work fell to the. hands of their successors, the London County Council ; and Lord Rosebery, chairman, Mr. Firth, deputy chairman, and other members, came down to do honour to the occasion. They were received at the Arsenal station by a committee representing Woolwich and Plumstead, and escorted through the town by a procession which included the Warspite boys, the friendly societies, trade societies, and numerous bands of music. The route lay through New Road, Thomas Street, Green's End, Powis Street and Hare Street, along the whole of which masts and banners lined the way, and the town was ablaze with colour. The Volunteers, 2nd Kent Artillery, 3rd Kent Artillery, and 3rd Kent Rifles, kept the ground. A grand stand for six hundred persons had been erected by the Local Board at the south approach, and every point of vantage throughout the town was packed with people. The steamer Gordon performed the first trip, having on board about five hundred passengers and two carriages and pairs of horses. North Woolwich sent its friendly societies and band to meet the procession,, which perambulated High Street, Albert Road and Storey Street, back to the pier, the streets making a brave show of bunting. On return- ing to the south side, Lord Rosebery stood up in his carriage opposite the aforesaid stand, and exclaimed : \u2014 - \"In the name of the London County Council, I have the honour,\" and the very great pleasure of declaring this Free Ferry open to the public.\" There was afterwards a banquet at the Freemasons' Hall, Mount"], [144, "474 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Pleasant (where Plumstead erected a triumphal arch of evergreens, bid ding '\u2022' Welcome to Plumstead \"), and the town was illuminated at night. For the first few days the rush to the ferry was tremendous, and thousands of visitors came to see it. Owing to some deficiency in the hydraulic apparatus the vehicular traffic did not commence until Friday, May 3rd, 18S9. The two steamers were named Gordon and Duncan, after our two well-known Woolwich heroes. Duval's House. \u2014 Dissociate North Woolwich from its ferry con nection with the south side, and the materials for its history are slight. In 1830 its chief topographical interest centred in Duval's house, which stood upon a site which is now occupied by the docks. It was usually spoken of by the vulgar as \" The Devil's House,\" and it was known of all men because, until a comparatively recent period, it was the only dwelling-place on that side of the water for miles in each direction. The ordinary belief was that it had once been tenanted by a family named Duval, earlier in the present century, but I find it spoken of as the \" Devil's House \" as long ago as 1720, and the title is perpetuated by later authorities. \"The Water Companion from Gravesend to London,\" the work evidently of some good old pilot, written in 1802, \"for captains, passengers, and mariners who frequent the passage boats and hoys,\" says : \u2014 The \"Devil's House \"was once a public house, and is probably so called in derision from being part of the possession of a religious order, for the monastery of Stratford Langthorne was possessed of lands in this part of Woolwich. Whatever may have been its origin and purpose, Duval's house, or its ruined fragment, was standing about 1860, and was tenanted by a man who had charge of the cattle on the marshes. Previous Existence. \u2014 When we find that there was virtually no population in 1837, it will read strangely and dubiously that, some time prior to 1790, North AVoolwich contained a number of houses and a chapel-of-ease, which is asserted, on the evidence of an old MS., by several historians. There is probably some mistake about this record. But that the place underwent certain vicissitudes even before the rail way came, witness the following paragraph : \u2014 Feb., 1840.\u2014 A man was charged before the magistrates at AVoolwich with stealing timber from ten empty houses at North AVoolwich, one of which is a mansion of twenty-three rooms. They belong to an old gentleman named Mills, who built them twelve years ago at a cost of \u00a310,000, but they have been more than ten years unoc cupied and are nearly in ruins. A Solitary Station.\u2014 There is no sign of the mansion now, and"], [145, "W00LAVICH. 475 the ruins of all the ten houses had vanished in 1849. Indeed, in 1846, when Mr. Ruegg wrote his little work on \" Woolwich and its Environs,\" he reported that \" the only tenements on the north side of the river were the old tavern known as the Barge House (a small house, evidently once of some repute, but now, owing to the insalubrity of the site, occupied only by the family of a shepherd), and the terminus of the Eastern Counties Railway.\" The railway had only just been opened, and it was singular, Mr. Ruegg adds, \" to hear the whistle of the loco motive and the clatter of iron wheels where, twelve months since, the heron, the plover, and the bittern roamed in almost undisturbed solitude.\" I should be disposed to regard this latter comparison as a poetical flight did I not know that Mr. Ruegg was a sound and conscientiousTnatu ralist and a good sportsman, with an especial partiality for waterfowl.* The Barge House. \u2014 The Barge House was originally and literally The Royal Albert Docks. a barge with a wooden hut built upon it. It is said to have been at one time a floating residence, but in 1810-20, as I learn from a reliable informant, it was high and dry ashore. The owner of the barge built a cottage on the inland side, and in course of time the Old Barge House tavern came into being. North Woolwich Town. \u2014 The origin of North AVoolwich as a town dates from about 1846. The railway gave it a new existence, and the opening of the Gardens in June, 1851, soon served to attract both residents and visitors. Then the parish authorities began to look to their boundaries. Eccentric Boundaries. \u2014 The lines which divide North Woolwich from East and West Ham are, however, so utterly irregular and so * In a chapter on \" Birds,\" which may be found in the same volume, Mr. BtiCgg says, \"I generally contrive a full bag from knowing the exact haunt of each bird.\""], [146, "476 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. palpably at variance with the course of the streams and roads which usually give at least direction to such divisions, that it is not surprising to learn that there have from the earliest times been disputes between the two parishes on points of territory. The accepted lines are most unsatisfactory, zigzagging in all directions, and actually allowing a pro montory of the neighbouring parish to jut out into the middle of the river, dividing the Woolwich portion completely in twain. It is only by crossing to South Woolwich and there connecting with both of these detachments that they become welded into one. The boundaries at the two extremes, east and west, by Barking Creek and by Ham Creek, are reasonable, and here and there the line intelligently follows one of those inland ridges sometimes called \"county walls,\" which are really embankments thrown up in early days for the reclamation of the marshes. At no other point is it probable that the ancient line has been preserved. An Extinct Waterway. \u2014 Ham Creek, just mentioned, was on the western boundary. It is now the site of a sewer outfall, constructed by the West Ham Board. It was to some extent navigable in old times, but of late years, owing to the diversion of the land drainage, it has almost disappeared. In 1656, I find that Ham Creek was let by its owner to Cromwell for the use of the navy, under a fifteen years' agree ment at \u00a310 a year, which was ratified by Charles IL, in whose reign Capt. Badiley, of the King's Dockyard at Woolwich, applied for orders to remove the guns and ballast from the Success and \" haul her into Ham Creek.\" The Creek is shown of good size in the plan of 1588 (page 29.S). It is now scarcely to be traced. A Camp at North Woolwich. \u2014 We must not expect to find many historical records of North AVoolwich, for the place, indeed, had scarcely a name fifty years ago. But it appears that in 1667, when the Dutch held possession of the Thames, and threatened to ruin all that was left of London by the Great Fire of the previous year, \"Sir Allan Apsley's regiment was quartered at the point of land over against Woolwich.\" His force consisted of three field officers, thirteen captains, and probably six companies of men. In a letter dated from \" The marsh, over against Woolwich, June 17th, 1667,\" Sir Allan Apsley complains that his men are deserting him, and \" cannot be persuaded that they are obliged to stay.\" Barking. \u2014 Barking, on the north-east, was, until recent years, one of the chief fishing towns of England, but the fish which were formerly brought by her smacks to London are now carried by steamers, and her special trade is destroyed, though a good share of her population live by it still."], [147, "477 WOOLWICH Barking Church. \u2014 Barking Church, which is a conspicuous object on our northern landscape, is part of the old nunnery founded so long since as a.d. 675 by Erkenwald, Bishop of London, and son of Annas, King of the East Anglias. It was the second nunnery established in England, the elder one being that of Folkestone, a.d. 630. Barking nunnery was laid waste by the Danes in 870, and so it is believed to have remained until after the Norman Conquest (1066), when it was restored. Dorothy Barleigh, the last Abbess, surrendered the old house to King Henry VIII. on Nov. 14th, 1539. The nunnery stood on the north side of the churchyard, and the gate and part of the wall still remain. Barking Creek. \u2014 Barking Creek, from having been the chief port of the London fish supply, is now only notorious by reason of the sewer outfall of the northern drainage of London on the one side of it and the malodorous chemical factories on tbe other. How Woolwich crossed the River. \u2014 Why have we North Wool wich ? From the earliest times the chroniclers have been puzzled to account for part of Woolwich being on the north side of the Thames at all. Writers, old and new, constantly comment upon the almost singular instance which the town presents of a parish bisected by a broad river, and there is probably no local saw so frequently quoted as the saying that, \" more wealth passes through Woolwich than any other place in the world.' ' How this peculiar arrangement came to pass is matter of specu lation, but since I took to thinking over the fact I have held the belief that it arose from the division of the land among his followers by William the Conqueror, and that the estate at North Woolwich, coming into the possession of the noble who owned Kent, was added to his county for his convenience. There is reason to believe that Haimo (or Haino), Sheriff of Kent under the Conqueror, held this territory on the north bank, and it is at least feasible that the arrangement began with him. Of course there are other theories. At one time I found the popular impression to be that a dead body had something to do with the annexa tion. The corpse of a man was said to have been cast ashore on the Essex side and left without burial until the Woolwich constables brought it across the river and gave it decent interment, by virtue of which they claimed and obtained the new territory. To trace the con nection to some natural source we must imagine that the river has changed its course, and suppose it to have once run along the line marked by the Albert Docks, but there is nothing to support this theory in the historic records, nor would prehistoric evidences, if there were any, help us to explain an arrangement which, though its origin be lost, cannot be very remote. Count Haimo, the Norman knight, was made Sheriff of Kent about the year 1070, and as this noble had lands H H"], [148, "478 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. on both sides of the river, I say it is reasonable to suppose that he may have embraced them all within his \"county.\" However, this is a matter upon which opinions vary and will probably continue to vary until the end of time. Mr. J. R. Scott, F.S.A., makes another suggestion Before the Conquest and in Danish times many of our riparian parishes in Kent held by Harold, Leofric, and Swene, as sons of Earl Godwin of Kent, extended to the other side of the river in the county of Essex\u2014 the parishes of Woolwich, Milton-next- Gravesend, Higham, and Chalk being instances of this kind\u2014 and were probably held as precautions against attack and for security of possession. A writer in Notes and Queries has said \u2014 Generally speaking, the River Thames is considered the dividing line between the counties of Kent and Essex except at Woolwich ; but that this has always been so is by no means certain with regard to AAToolwich ; a small portion of this parish at the ] present hour lies on the opposite side of the river, entirely surrounded by the county of Essex, and yet it is accounted as a portion of Kent. Then in the description of Chalk, near Gravesend, given in Domesday, it is stated that \" In Exesse there is one hide which justly pertains to this manor ; \" and again in the Domesday description of Higham is this. \"And in Exeese pasture for two hundred sheep.\" Now, although these outlying parts of Chalk and Higham are said to be in \"Exesse\" yet the idea intended to be conveyed was plainly that they formed parts of Kent \u2014 there was no other way of expressing the fact without a long periphrasis ; and if North Woolwich had been described in Domesday we should doubtless have found the same expression. It is certain that at the present day neither Chalk nor Higham has any jurisdiction on the northern side of the Thames. Considering that three Kentish waterside parishes stretched across the stream, and that stream of no mean width, a question thus proposes itself to the curious inquirer, whether all the waterside parishes from Deptford downwards had not each a portion on the other side of the stream. Again, we find that in the \" History of South Britain,\" by Henshall, 1798, the question of these outlying portions of certain Kentish manors is considered. Henshall concludes that Alestan, the bailiff of London, held them as representative of the Bishop and Church of London, who then had custody of the course of the Thames, and were proprietors of all lands recovered from the encroachments of the tide, and that as an ecclesiastic he was permitted to continue the holding, which was con firmed to his nephew, Helto. He points out that in the time of the Saxons the Thames estuary was probably wider than it is at present, and many of the marsh lands must have been frequently inundated. From all the theories the reader may select the best or build a new hypothesis. Let us come down to facts and the records of our own lime. The Great Eastern Railway. \u2014 By some strange omission the newspapers of the day do not appear to have noticed the opening of the Eastern Counties (now Great Eastern Railway) to Woolwich, but the general manager of the company courteously informs me that the"], [149, "WOOLWICH. 479 date was the 14th of June, 1847, which was two years earlier than the North Kent line on the other side of the river. A Phantom Railway. \u2014 Some such railway had been projected more than fourteen years earlier. In January, 1833, notice was given of a Parliamentary bill \" to form a railroad from the Commercial Road, Limehouse, to the river Thames, at East Ham, opposite Woolwich, and also a carriage road to run parallel, or nearly so, with the railway ; also for power to establish a ferry across the Thames to AVoolwich ; also to form docks, or slips and landing-places on both sides of the river \u2014 the railway to pass through Stepney, Limehouse, Bromley,\" &c. This Bird's-eye View of the River, 1848. scheme, had it been carried out, would have united the district with Blackwall and Poplar, but it was not to be. The Pavilion Gardens. \u2014 The opening of the railway laid the foundation of North Woolwich. The formation of the Royal Pavilion Gardens gave it some kind of renown about 1851, and the local authorities voluntarily surrendered the public footpath along the river bank in order that the pleasure-ground might have its esplanade. Henley's Telegraph Works. \u2014 The new town languished, how ever, until the introduction of submarine telegraphy about 1868 gave an impetus to the local trade, and for nearly ten years afterwards the HH2"], [150, "480 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. enterprise of Mr. W. T. Henley kept North Woolwich in a highly flourishing state. Troubles then began. The wreck of the La Plata, Mr. Henley's telegraph ship, in the Bay of Biscay on November 29 th, 1874, was the greatest calamity that befell the district. Only seven teen persons were saved, and fifty-eight drowned, many of them resi dents of this place. But other misfortunes followed, and the works were closed at the end of 1877, afterwards to reopen, but never to resume their former glory. Beckton and the Docks. \u2014 Other industries have, however, found employment for the people, the most important being the Beckton Gas Works, established about 1870, and the Royal Albert Docks, opened by the Duke of Connaught on June 24th, 1880. Disasters. \u2014 There have been several disasters sustained by the young township in addition to those just named, though not strictly within the borders of North AVoolwich. On October 25th, 1873, in a dense fog, a waterman's boat was upset while conveying a party of workmen to Henley's, and nine persons were drowned, namely, George Gray, Thomas Smith, Patrick Martin, Henry Tanner, Joseph Jocelyn, Samuel Jones, William Piper, Patrick Lanna, and John Taylor. Digby, the waterman, and but one of his passengers, John Wright, were saved. The circumstances will bo given fully elsewhere. At Silvertown, on April 12th, 1880, an explosion occurred within the works of Messrs. Burt, Boulton & Haywood, and killed eleven of the workpeople. Five men were suffocated in a well at Beckton on May 16th, 1870 ; and on May 25th, 1880, two men were burned to death in their lodgings near Silvertown station. The Dagenham Level. \u2014 North Woolwich is under the Dagen ham Level Commission, and is represented by one member elected by the Local Board. Pennant, in the course of his famous \"Journey from London to the Isle of \"Wight,\" about 1799, visited this locality, and wrote concerning the marshes. His report states that \u2014 In the year 1707, a breach was made in the drain which conveyed the water from the marshes bordering on Dagenham, by the blowing up a small sluice, or trunk. This might have been at first easily stopped, but by neglect, in the space of fourteen years it spread into several large branches, like the natural arms of a river, by the force and fall of the water returning from the marsh land on every reflux of the tide. The largest of these arms is above a mile and a half long, and, in some places, four or five hundred feet broad, and from twenty to forty feet deep. By this accident, about a hundred and twenty acres of solid marsh land have been washed into the Thames, composed of gravel, clay, and other materials. The weightiest was lodged on the outside of the mouth of the breach, above and below, and the lightest carried to more distant places. It likewise lodged where there happened to be an eddy ; so that in many of the reaches were found shallows, unknown before, and about Wool-"], [151, "WOOLWICH. 481 toich, where the men-os-war were moored, there was a considerable less depth of water. Some new banks were thrown up below Crravesend ; so that the very naviga tion of the Thames was by this accident threatened with ruin, and, of course, beggary, brought on our flourishing metropolis, and consequential desertion. After several very unskilful attempts to stop the breach, and prevent further devastation, the famous engineer, John Perry, after he had left Russia, undertook, and completely remedied the evil. At present, the body of water which is left is furnished with sluices, to let off that which, at times of hard rains, flows from the land. In it are plenty of carp, and other fresh- water fish. A set of gentlemen have, for the diversion of fishing, built on its banks a large room, kitchen, and a small apartment or two. Both sides of the river are guarded against the tide by waUe, or mounds of earth, which run for many miles along the low country. The marshes of Essex have ever been stigmatised for their dreadful agues : \u2014 AAHicre hazy fogs and drizzling vapours dwell, Thither raw damps on drooping wings repair, And shiv'ring quartans shake the sickly air. Modern North Woolwich. \u2014 Notwithstanding its adversities, North Woolwich has been since 1847 a growing town, and has of late years shown considerable development. About half the houses are in. Sections of the River Thames, drawn by Captain Bullock, R.N., 1831 . the parish of East Ham, a projection of which is, as we have seen, wedged between the two divisions of North Woolwich proper, and pushed out through the Royal Pavilion Gardens to the middle of she river. The Alliance with South Woolwich. \u2014 The union between North and South Woolwich, so remote, so strange, has been attended with fewer inconveniences than might be inferred from such an attach ment, and has in some respects been of advantage to both sections of the divided parish. The ancient alliance has scarcely ever been in danger of dissolution, and although it may have been at various times scheduled for consideration in the schemes of Boundary Commis-"], [152, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 482 sions, neither the North nor the South has yet evinced any disposition for divorce. The Free Ferry. \u2014 At present the Free Steam Ferry, the gift of the Metropolitan Board of Works, promises to cement more closely than ever the connection which has so long existed, and every year of matrimony increases the difficulty of separation. The River between. \u2014 While providing greater facilities for cross in- the river, the Metropolitan authorities are also making strenuous efforts to purify the river itself, the condition of which for many years past has rendered life intolerable upon its waters or along its banks. The cause removed \u2014 the filth of London sent away to sea \u2014 and the \u25a0' .silvery Thames\" may return again to the character which Pennant ga-, e it in his \" London \" of 1793, wherein he says\u2014 This noble river continues fresh as far as AVoolwich, and even there is brackish only at spring tides. Thus at our capital it is perfectly pure. The Thames has between its source and Woolwich every species of fish (with a few exceptions) found in British rivers. Denham's lines, once oft-quoted, but now sadly out of date, also recur to the mind : \u2014 Thames, the most loved of all the Ocean's sons. By his old sire, to his embraces runs, Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea, Like mortal life to meet eternity. \u00bb * * * * AVhen he, to boast or to disperse bis stores, Full of the tributes of his grateful shores, A'isits the world and in bis flying tow'rs Brings home to us and makes both Indies ours ; Finds wealth where 'tis, bestows it where it wants, Cities in deserts, woods in cities plants : So that to us no thing, no place, is strange, While his fair bosom is the world's exchange. Oh, could I flow like thee, and make thy stream My great example, as it is my theme ! Though deep, yet clear ; though gentle, yet not dull ; Strong, without rage ; without o'erflowing, full ! It is now a poisoned stream, and AVoolwich, North and South, has long suffered in order that the rest of the Metropolis might live ; but, now that the population and industries of London are spreading hither ward, London owes us the remedy. Let us glance at the great gas works and the marvellous docks. Gaslight and Coke Company. \u2014 Beckton, or \"Beck\" Town, was so called in honour of a former governor of the Gaslight and Coke Com pany \u2014 the late Mr. Simon Adams Beck. The Company's old works were crowded up in the heart of London, and, when larger premises became"], [153, "483 WOOLWICH. necessary, it was thought that th3 cost of coal might be reduced by removing some distance down the river, not only saving cartage and barging, but having ample space for the storage and utilisation of the residual products. The site at North Woolwich was accordingly secured ; the first pile was driven in the marshy soil on the 19th of No vember, 1868, and the works were in operation on the 25th of Novem ber, 1870. The pier, which is a wrought-iron structure on cast-iron columns, has a frontage to the river of 800 feet, and projects 400 feet from the shore. It will berth five steam colliers of the largest size and will unload 12,000 tons in twenty-four hours. There are also two jetties and an ample quay. From the pier a viaduct runs right and left through twelve retort-houses and from end to end of the works, a distance of three-quarters of a mile. The retort-houses are nearly alike. The largest is 510 feet long by 100 feet wide, and can make 5,500,000 cubic feet of gas per day. It contains 405 retorts. Each retort-house has purifying and other plant attached to it, so that Beckton may be said to consist of twelve complete gas-works. Each retort is charged with about three cwts. of coal every six hours. The gas is cleansed in scrubbing towers, 60 feet high, then purified of sulphuretted hydrogen, &c, and passed into the gas-holders, which are eight in number, and from thence conveyed through 4-feet pipes to AA'estminster for distribution, picking up from smaller stations and filling up other gas-holders en route. Beckton alone consumes nearly a million tons of coal per annum. The works produce at the present time 40,000,000 cubic feet per day, and benefit the locality by employing 4,000 workmen at the depth of winter. Royal Albert Docks. \u2014 The Royal Albert Dock is a continuation of the Victoria Docks, which enter the land a little below Blackwall, and the whole form a vast dock nearly three miles in length. At the entrances in Galleons Reach is a river wharf stretching 1,120 feet. The depth alongside is 27 feet. The Albert Dock was completed in 1880, but the new works to the basin, which were commenced in May, 1884, were finished by a gigantic blasting operation on April 24th (Good Friday), 1886. This operation consisted of the removal of the dock wall on the north-east, 520 feet in length, 38 feet high, and about 6 feet thick, the total weight being 7,850 tons. Holes (1,430 in number) were perforated and charged with 2,900 lbs. of gelatine dynamite, the charges varying from six pounds at the foot of the wall to half a pound at the top. The whole were simultaneously fired by electricity, and the entire mass was broken into fragments. The dock is entered by two parallel locks, each 550 feet long and 80 feet wide. The northerly one has a depth of 36 feet on the sill, and the other 30 feet. They open into the Galleons basin, which comprises"], [154, "484 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 15\u00b1 acres of water, 32 feet deep. A pumping station, throwing 125,000 o-allons per minute, regulates the height of the water. A passage, crossed by a swing bridge and the high road, connects with the main dock, which covers 432 acres, of which 87 are water. The quays are lined with great warehouses and lines of railway connecting with the Great Eastern and other systems. The docks are lighted with electricity by Messrs. Siemens Bros., 29 powerful arc-lights being provided and suspended 60 feet high, while 140 arc-lamps light the sheds. The Census. \u2014 The population of North Woolwich at the Census in 1881 numbered 1,504 souls, and there were 227 houses, of which 214 were inhabited. Church and Schools. \u2014 The ecclesiastical district of St. John the Evangelist is partly in Kent and partly in Essex \u2014 partly in Woolwich and partly in East Ham.* Between 1850 and 18G0 the few inhabitants there were at North Woolwich had no means of public worship other than a little iron church near Tidal Basin, from whence the Rev. Mr. Douglas carried on a mission extending all over \"The Marsh. \"f Subsequently Mr. Douglas was instrumental in building the Church of St. Mark, at Silvertown, which was a great comfort to the whole district, but still remote from North Woolwich. Then came the Rev. Henry Boyd, who worked for a time with Mr. Douglas and then succeeded him in charge of the church at Silvertown. He was greatly strengthened by the help of the Rev. John Wynford Alington, who was his curate for many years and greatly beloved. J As North Woolwich grew, Mr. Boyd set up a mission in a private house until he had erected the building which is now the girls' school, which was at first used as a mixed school during the week and a church and Sunday school on the Sabbath. The Rev. H. R. Baker, now vicar of St. Michael and All Angels, South Woolwich, was curate here from 1863 to 1865. The present Church of St. John the Evan gelist was erected in 1872 and consecrated on September 26th. As a district chapelry it was established on February 13th, 1877, and it was endowed with \u00a350 per annum from the Common Fund on January 25th, 1878 ; with \u00a316 13s. 4d. added on May 24th, 1878, and \u00a33 6s. 8d. on March 25th, 1881. Shortly after the church was completed, the Rev. H. Boyd sur rendered his charge to the Rev. W. F. Witts, who remained only a few years and was succeeded by the Rev. Charles Bull. Mr. Bull stayed for five years, and after him came the present vicar, the Rev. A. D. Piper, in 1883. The present schools for boys and infants were erected after the church, i.e. about 1877. * See page 171. t The church was known as St. Luke's Iron Church.

PLATE LV f"], [157, "Lesness Abbey Ruins. (Drawn by Dr. Stukely in 1750.) PLUMSTEAD CHAPTER XI THE EARLY DAYS OK 1'LUMSTEAI Manor of Plumstead. \u2014 Remembering that Plumstead was forty years ago in the chrysalis of a village, it is a little remarkable to find its records so numerous, so varied, and so interesting. We must not forget, however, that the annals of the place were always, until com paratively recent times, such as were peculiar to a merely rural parish, and that for two or three hundred years after Woolwich could boast of a busy town, Plumstead was still in its primitive rusticity. Prior to the sixteenth century Woolwich, Plumstead, and Charlton were all rural parishes, equal in rank and similar in character. When the guide books came into vogue a century later, Woolwich Dockyard had been established, and Woolwich consequently began to forge ahead. These guides, it is true, have all something to say of Plumstead also, but, unfortunately, after the manner of guides, they all say much the same thing. One of the earliest of these itineraries, published in 1G50 and entitled \"A Survey of Kent, by Richard Kilburn, of Hawkherst, Esquire,\" says \u2014 Plumstead lieth at the north-west side of the county, adjoining to the River of Thames, about one mile towards the north-east distant from Woolwich, in the Bailiwick of Sutton Dartford, Hundred of Little and Lesnes, Lath of Sutton at Hone, west division of the county, and upper division of Justices in that Lath.

It is in the Deanery of Dartford, and Diocese of Rochester, and the Church is called St. Nicholas."], [158, "486 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. At the Conquest. \u2014 The foregoing, of course, though ancient, is not the earliest of Plumstead chronicles. There is the extract from Domesday Book (1086) printed in facsimile at page 8 ; but it should be noted that this extract is only one of two references made to Plum stead in the Domesday, which assessed it in two moieties, the ecclesi astic estate separate from the lay manor. Taking this, as in Woolwich, for our data, and eschewing for the moment the stereotyped guide books, we may find some satisfaction for ourselves in pursuing the historical remains which relate to this place. We shall be led in the course of our investigation over much new ground, and, expecting little, be rewarded with some considerable knowledge. Even in our own time, within the memory of middle-age, Plumstead was but a poor and insignificant village, only its borders emerging from the embryo state in which it lay dormant for centuries. To seek vitality in the records of such a place, or even so much as vestiges of history, beyond those dull returns of tithes and taxes which mostly constitute the chronicles of village life, seemed at the outset a vain task. AVe shall see presently how strange a history has this Plumstead, and marvel at its close relation to men and matters prominently placed in the national archives of England. The Name of Plumstead. \u2014 In the first instance, however, we are led to inquire whence Plumstead derived its name, and meet at once a tough problem. Most of the authorities can find no better source than the \" plums \" which grew in its orchards, and we are bound to acknow ledge that its soil has always given it a good character for the cultiva tion of fruit. Its productiveness and its proximity to the metropolis were advantages of which it seems to have made the most from an early date, advantages, moreover, which were shared to some extent by all this part of Kent. There is an old saw which says \u2014 \" Kent is divided in three, The first has health not wealth, The second has wealth not health, And the third has both in fee.\" Thus explained by Mr. J. A. Sparvel-Bayly, F.S.A The first is East Kent, pleasant and healthy, but with much poor land ; the second is the Weald and Romney Marsh, famous for fine pastures and rich farms, but extremely liable to ague ; and the third is that part of Kent near London, where the situation is healthy, the soil good, and the inhabitants rich. At any rate, Plumstead was rich with orchards down to our own time, and it is an established fact that here the cherry was first acclimatised in England. It is also recorded that when \" the pippin was brought from over the sea \" in the sixteenth century, the delicious apple was first grown in Plumstead. The names of Orchard Road and Plum Lane survive in evidence of their origin, and the part of Plum stead Road for some distance below Burrage Road was known as"], [159, "487 PLUMSTEAD. Orchard Place long after the houses were built ; the orchard behind it remained until after 1850. Are we then to assume that its \" plums \" gave the name to Plum stead ? Let us hear some more witnesses. Domesday Book settles the orthography, \" Plumstede,\" as early as 1086, and, unlike other parishes, the place has held its designation almost unchanged from the earliest periods. It is called \" Plumsted \" by AVeever in 1631 ; it is obviously misprinted \" Plumstreet \" in 1707 on the tomb of the Rev. Benjamin Barnett, at one time vicar of the parish ; and it is described as \" Plum stead \" by writers in all ages. The second syllable, in fact, we have no trouble about, for the affix \"stead,\" however it be spelt, simply means a \" place.\" The Rev. J. K. Walpole, who wrote a pamphlet while curate here, suggests a better origin than the fruity one. Here probably lived, he says, the people who collected from the wild geese and herons of the marshes the plumes to ornament the dames and gallants of the court, and quills for the scriptoria of the monasteries. It is to be noted that there is a tavern called The Plume of Feathers near the marsh, and this house bore the same name in 1720. The parish, therefore, may have been named the Piume-place or Plumestead. The subject is, however, still open to discussion, and I may suggest several more solutions. In the west of England* Plum means \" light \" and \" soft \" (like the Plumstead lands) ; in the north it stands for \" sensible \" and \"honest \" (application according to taste) ; and in Kent it was the synonym of the adverb \" very \" or \" exceedingly \" (which has no association with the subject). It has also signified \" straight \" and \" upright,\" in the sense in which we use \"plumb,\" f and we meet with it conveying the idea of perfect roundness : \u2014 Make their attire to sit \u00a3>Zum-round. \u2014 Harrison. Plum-fat is also mentioned by Florio. These significations, however, all fail to satisfy, and the most probable of them, which is the west of England usage, must give precedence to a Kentish practice of applying the description of plumb to anything dry and hard, including \"a thick headed fellow.\" In plumb, indeed, we may feasibly trace the root, for in old English, and in the north to this day, a plumb is a clump J of trees, or a crowd of people, or a mass or group of any kind. We read : \u2014 Rydes into rowte his deede to revenge, Presedes into the plumpe and with a prince meetes. Morte d' Arthur. King Richard perceived that the people by plumpes fled from him to King Henry. * In Devon plummy is still the equivalent of \" soft, wet, and mouldy.\" t \" Plummet \" was sometimes written plombe. X \" Clump \" is supposed to have been a corruption oi plump, or this of that."], [160, "488 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. The woods which crowned the hills or clustered down their sides may have supplied the name. Plumsted is also a patronymic, and the parish was once the family seat. Weever, Rector of Erith, writing in 1631 of Plumstead Church, says \u2014 Here under a faire gravestone lieth buried John Plumsted, Esquire, Receiver General ofthe Dutchie of Lancaster. But, after all the argument, we remain, as at the outset, unable to determine the source of the name Plumstead* Ancient Valuation. \u2014 We must not be surprised at the predilec tion of the old topographers for finding the origin of the word in the orchards, for in the days when agriculture was the staple industry of the land, all the parishes adjacent to London were of especial value, and Plumstead, having a large area under culture, had in that circum stance its chief importance. Lambarde's \"Perambulation of Kent,\" dated 1590, gives the following schedule of the assessments payable under the tax called the \" Tenth and Fifteenth,\" from which some idea of comparative values may be derived :\u2022 \u2014 In the Lathe of Sutton at Hone.

Plumstead Hops. \u2014 There were even hop-gardens at Plumstead Cock's Guide of 1837 says \u2014 Just above the village of Plumstead a few hop-grounds are scattered, chiefly where the wooded hills afford them shelter. * The name is not a common one, for there are but two other Plumsteads in England, and both (\"Great\" and \" Little\") are in Norfolk, a county which, by the way, is distinguished, like our Plumstead, for its fens and waterfowl. The colonists in South Africa have set up a Plumstead of their own, and there is another Plum stead in the American state of Pennsylvania (Bucks Co.). Whether or not these were designated in fond remembrance of the Kentish Plumstead we have no means of judging. They, too, may or may not have had their names suggested by their plum-crops."], [161, "489 PLUMSTEAD. The fickle hop evidently had no liking for Plumstead, for the gardens soon disappeared and left no trace. The Old Church. \u2014 Early in the ecclesiastical archives, which are always the best preserved, we come upon the old church. The Church of St. Nicholas, Plumstead, is unquestionably ancient. Tradition assigns to it an age of 800 or 900 years, and it has architectural features which are commonly attributed to the Norman builders. There is also a gravestone long forming part of the pavement of the church, which is declared to be older than the Conquest, for it has round the edge characters which were in use before the Normans. These signs are nearly obliterated, and the stone has been set up on end in the churchyard, where the weather will eradicate the remainder. It appears to be the cover of a stone sarcophagus, and it has been labelled at a venture, \" Roman Stone.\" The opinions formed on these evidences are fairly supported by early deeds and charters. In the year 960 (more than a century before the arrival of the Conqueror), Plumstead was given by King Edgar to the abbot and convent of St. Augustine in Canterbury, as Thorne, their chronicler, testifies. Phillipot, who wrote in 1659, says that St. Augustine's was robbed of this possession b}r Godwin, Earl of Kent, who settled it upon his son Tostins, but that \u2014 It was restored to that seminary by William the Conqueror, and remained fastened to their revenue until the rough hand of Henry VIII., by a public sup pression, unlinked it, and then it was by that prince, in the 36th 3-ear of his reign (1544), granted to Sir Edward Boughton, of Burwash Court, from whom it is now devolved by descent to hi3 successor, Mr. Boughton. The abbot of St. Augustine's, to adde more eminence to this mannor, not only obtained a charter of free warren to Plumsted, in the 36th year of Henry III. (1251), but likewise by grant procured a market to be held here weekly on the Tuesday, and a fair yearly three days at St. Nicholas, videlicit, the eve, the day, and the day after ; both of which were allowed by the judges itinerant in the seventh year of Edward I. (1279). Tostins, or Tostan, here mentioned, was slain in a rebellion against his brother Harold, and Plumstead with the rest of his estates reverted to the Crown. At the Conquest, King William made the parish revenue over to his half-brother Odo, Bishop of Baieux, afterward?* Earl of Kent, who re-granted it in moieties, and at different times, to the monks of St. Augustine's. Lesness Ahhey. \u2014 -Within the century which followed, an institu tion of the greatest consequence to primitive Plumstead came into being. Lesness Abbeyr was erected in 1178. The Low Lands. \u2014 But, before proceeding further into this subject , it is necessary to refer to another, equally remote and equally influeu-"], [162, "490 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. tial in shaping these records. Whether at this time the marshes had been reclaimed from the river is a disputed point. (Several of the old writers assert that the whole enclosure was first accomplished by the monks of Lesness Abbey in the reign of Edward I., between 1278 and 1307, but we cannot doubt that the land had been rescued from the Thames at some anterior time, for Stow assures us that in the year 1236 a sudden rise of the Thames overflowed the marshes in such a manner that many of the inhabitants perished. He speaks of the inundation as \u2014 Causing the marshes at AVoolwich to be all in a sea, wherein boats and other ves sels were carried with the stream, so that, besides cattle, tbe greatest number of men, women, anil children, inhabitants there, were drowned. The River Wall. \u2014 It will be observed that Woolwich, and not Plumstead, is named in the quotation, but there is no doubt whatever that the Plumstead marshes are referred to, the name of Woolwich being frequently applied in all ages as a generic title to the whole district. AVho, then, built the river wall? Many take us back to a.d. 400, and declare that the great embankment from London to the Medway was all constructed by the Romans, but it is significant that the em bankment is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, a very remarkable omission, which almost impels the conclusion that the work was subse quent to 1080. There is no doubt, however, that after their enclosure the marshes were repeatedly flooded, and they were probably more than once rescued by the abbots of Lesness, who certainly claimed and held the land for several centuries. There will be more to say on this subject later, but it is necessary at once to understand the original line of high- water mark before this artificial barrier was erected. It is evident that the river, when uncontrolled, overflowed the marsh or \" saltings \" at every tide, and swept the low lands which descend from the hills south of the railway. The Old Beach. \u2014 Plumstead Church stood on the very beach. It is named after St. Nicholas, the patron saint of fishermen, and it was probably from the vantage-ground which it occupies that the primitive fishers took to their boats. A Vanished Highway. \u2014Between the church and the river, on the margin of the stream, ran the ancient road from Erith to Woolwich. Just as it now leaves Erith, washed by the tide, it continued most of the wayr. This fact, which a study of the ground enforces, is confirmed by several old maps. One published in Gough's edition of Camden (1789) is very clear, and I have copied the portion which illustrates my point. This map, however, I am bound to say, appears to have been printed from a plate of older date, for Bishop Gibson's earlier edition of Camden ignores the old road, and shows instead the highway over"], [163, "491 PLUMSTEAD. Bostall Hill. The probability is that the roads co-existed in ill-defined shape. I am disposed to think that the traffic from Erith was diverted from Abbey Wood up Bostall Lane, and the old road abandoned, during the disastrous floods which occurred in 1595, which was soon after Camden's own time. We read of extensive works being performed at Plumstead about that period, and the cutting through which we pass Part of Map from Camden's \" Britannica.\" * in ascending Bostall Hill may have been one of them. This must have been a laborious and costly undertaking, and I am surprised and disap pointed at finding no distinct record of it. The Fisher Village. \u2014 The assumption that the landing-place from the Thames was by the church ought to be justified by something stronger than mere supposition, and I think we may base it upon more than one testimony. I found the argument primarily upon the chalk * The reference marks (which I have inserted) in the above map may be thus explained : \u2014 a. Anchor and Hope JIanorway. B.

It would also have constituted a con venient \" hard \" for the boatmen, such as is to be found nowhere else until we come to Woolwich. Strand Field. \u2014 The fishermen's cottages also were built along the strand, and the large field still known as \"Strand Field,\"* which adjoins Mr. Russell's orchard, and slopes from the high road to the marsh level, was probably the site of the fisher village. Old tiles and other remnants of buildings abound in the soil of this field, especially near the bottom of the slope, where early inundations may have invaded the village and driven its people to higher and safer quarters. Coins of early date are discovered in this field, all, I believe, of the reigns of Edward I., IL, and III., and Richard IL, ranging in date from 1272 to 1399, a peculiar limit of time which is pregnant with conjecture.f I cannot learn that any coin has been turned up of so late a date as Richard III. (a.d. 1483), when it may be supposed that successive inundations had compelled the inhabitants to remove inland. Relics. \u2014 The line of the old road by the river is fast being effaced by buildings, but its position is fairly marked bj' Hartville Road and Gunning Street, and it is still traceable on the unbuilt land both to the cast and to the west. AVe shall meet with it again at Abbey Wood presently, but may spend a few moments in tracing it by means of the Camden map (p. 491) towards Woolwich. Some other of the early maps show the road from Woolwich to Erith in an absolutely straight course, but they are on a small scale and obscure. They nevertheless give colour to the reasonable conjecture that before Woolwich Warren was turned to account the main highway went directly across the ground now covered by the Royal Arsenal. My belief is that it passed close to the Tower Place and formed a continuation of the ancient High Street, at AArarren Lane. Cole Fields. \u2014 The abrupt diversion to the south at Cole Fields} (which was once a prolongation of Vicarage Road) shown in the map, and the bend which returns to the original direction at Cannon Row, were subsequent creations needful to graft the new on to the old * The name of \" Strand Place \" was quite recently borne by the adjacent houses in the newly-designated \" High Street.'' t I have a very good specimen of the silver groat of Edward I., riven to me by Air.

In this light the whole of the present road through Plumstead must be regarded as a comparatively modern innovation.* Wall-SCOt. \u2014 If further evidence of the riverside road be needed we have it in the plan of the Wall- scot or marsh district, all the land included therein being charged for the maintenance of the river wall and marsh sewers to this day.t The edge of the Wall-scot jurisdiction corresponded exactly with the course of the extinct road, which is now faintly indicated by a ridge or shallow embankment just where the ground rises from the marsh flat. An Ohsolete River. \u2014 Another feature of old Plumstead has likewise disappeared from this same locality. In a map of Kent drawn about 1580, and partly reproduced at page 531, there is seen a considerable stream or river extending from the Halfway House, near Crossness Point, up the Wickham Lane Valley, a short branch diverging eastward to the spot at which the abbey of Lesness stood (near Abbey Wood Station), and the other stretching past the eastern foot of Shooters' Hill through Well-end (Welling) to Eltham. Both these streams dwindled when the final embankment of the river and the enclosure of the marsh lands locked out the tide. But both are to be seen in the degenerate shape of ditches or watercourses to this day. And the Wickham Lane Valley is the bed of the Plumstead River. The True Romance of Abbey Wood. \u2014 But let us pursue the old road of which we have been speaking and trace the bygone memories of Lesness Abbey and Abbey Wood. Abbey Wood is only in part within the parish of Plumstead, but the spot on which the abbey stood is too inextricably associated with Plum stead history to be omitted from its records.} To-day we find Abbey Wood and its neighbour Bostall Heath pre served in all their natural simplicity and beaut}', while the hills to the westward and the eastward are peopled with townships. But the rural scenes which we now enjoy in our rambles about Bostall * Evidence in support, of this theory is afforded by a deed of sale, in 1538, by Sir Martin Bowes to Sir Edward Boughton of two acres in \" Colesfelde,\" described as \"south of the highway from Woolwich to Plumstead.\" This record disposes of my original belief that the fields on which the cartridge factory stands were named after Mr. Cole, who was a landowner in the parish at the beginning of this century. + The Wall-scot was a tax levied by the Dartford Commissioners of Sewers, but the care of the marshes has of late years been taken b}T the Plumstead District Board, and tlie wall-scot superseded by a marsh-rate. Recently a sliding scale has been adopted in which the value of the railway embankment as a second line of defence is recognised, and the property south of that barrier assessed at a reduced proportion, its safety depending less than that of the northern marshes upon the preservation ot the river wall. + The abbey, although within the parish of Erith, was two miles from the populated part of that parish, while it was barely a mile from the village of Plumstead. I I"], [166, "494 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. and Abbey Wood had at one time a far better chance of becoming the site of a town than either Erith or Belvedere, Plumstead or Woolwich. The Abbey and Roman Dock. \u2014 Far back in our history, when King Henry II. reigned, in pious conflict with the priesthood, the Saracens, and the French, the small but wealthy abbey of Lesness stood by the brink of the broad waters. Still farther away in time, perhaps when the Romans dwelt as conquerors in England, the early shipbuilders had here a naval station at which they built their ships of war and of commerce. With the deep hollow close by the ruins of the old abbey tradition has always associated the name of \" The Roman Dock,\" and, although tradition alone is a bad witness, tradition sup ported by collateral facts is always receivable as evidence. The dock is partly a natural \" slade\" and partly excavation. There are manifest Bostall Wood and Wickham Lane from Plumstead Common. signs of its having been deepened in places, and the angular protuber ances on the banks, which are like nothing in nature, were, I imagine, formed by heaps of soil scooped out ofthe basin (Plate LV., page 485)'. The likelihood of the Romans having previously built the river wall has already been mentioned, but, admitting the assumption, it is quite reasonable to suppose that before (and even after) that work was accomplished, a navigable creek or canal stretched to this spot.* All we see of this channel to-day is a mere ditch across the marsh, but in some old maps it is represented as a respectable river. The dock may have been maintained by a dam piled against the entrance (just where the road is), easily cut when a ship was finished and a favourable tide available for floating out. \" The creek is shown as a branch of the Plumstead River at page 531."], [167, "495 PLUMSTEAD. I know that in advancing this hypothesis I have to confront the fact that it has never been taken up or entertained, so far as I am aware, by any other writer, but I venture to declare my entire faith in the tradition of the Roman dock, and submit, at least, that the evidence is plausible. It must be conceded that the Romans, the Danes, and other early shipwrights, would build their vessels somewhere near the capital, and, apart from tradition and probability, I would ask if anyone can find a situation and a conformation so suitable and convenient for the purpose as this ? Remains of primitive boats have been dug out of the peat in this part of the marsh, and, although such discoveries merely show that the marsh was flooded when the wrecks occurred, they are to some extent in favour of the dock theory. From the rear of the dock there was an ancient road to London over Plumstead Common. This road, which will be further srioken of here after, and also the lower road which led to Woolwich, were of service, not only to the shqibuilders, but to that other active community which next made busy this pleasant scene, The Abbey Ruins. \u2014 The crumbling walls we see on the prominent ground are the vestiges of a flourishing monastery. AVest Wood, or Lesness, was founded in 1178 by that remarkable man, Richard de Lucy, Grand Justiciary of England, and Regent of the kingdom in the absence of Henry II. De Lucv appears to have resided at West Wood (that which we now call Abbey AVood), and to have been as brave a soldier as he was an accomplished lawyer and dis- tinguished statesman. He had fought in the Holy Land, and was everywhere famed and honoured for his learning, piety, and wisdom. His exalted position in the realm was second only to that of the throne itself. John Fisher, who wrote a description of the abbey ruins in 1776, says : \u2014 The genius of the religion which prevailed in his time led this wise man to build this monastic edifice and to endow it with ample possessions. It was begun by him not quite two years before his death, and, after he had finished it, he retired from the .1 Friar. active world, and, it is said, became the prior of his own convent. The king, unwilling to lose the counsel and assistance of so able and experienced a servant, earnestly endeavoured to dissuade him from entering into this idle and useless scheme of life, but it was a vain attempt. Influenced by the superstitious prejudices of the age, he n2"], [168, "496 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. thought the putting on of a monkish cowl would render his passage to heaven more speedy and less tormenting. And in another instance did he likewise show himselt to be a very bigoted Papist, for he made Thomas Becket,* jointly with the Virgin Mary, the patron and protector of his new society, though that haughty and seditious prelate had formerly excommunicated him for \" being a favourer of his sovereign and a contriver of those heretical pravities, the constitutions of Clarendon.\"! Richard de Lucy was buried hi the church belonging to his convent, and on removing part of the foundations of this building in the reign of King James I., several coffins with por traitures upon them were discovered in a vault, which are supposed to have contained the remains of this illustrious man and of some of his family. The abbey of Lesness was suppressed before the general dissolution of monasteries, Cardinal AVolsey having ppbtained a Papal bull for appropriating the revenues of it towards endowing the new college he had founded at Oxford (1524). De Lucy (or de Luci) began his career as a politician and a soldier in the days of Stephen. The fullest accounts of his life with which I have met will be found in Archdeacon Smith's \" History of Erith,\" and Lord Lyttelton's \"Life of Henry II.\" The archdeacon translates as follows the Knight-Abbot's epitaph, preserved in Weever's \"Monu ments \" (and famous old Weever was in his day, like Archdeacon .Smith, a rector of Erith, so long since as the reign of James I.) : \u2014 Richard the Lucy's Light is snatched to shade, To Justice, Peace, and State his court was paid. Christ, with Thy saints and Thee his rest be made. July's twice seventh on the world did shine. The year eleven hundred seventy-nine. Origin of Lesness. \u2014 Lesness Abbey took its title from the Lesse nesse (or \" little nose \" of land) which we now know as \" Crossness Point.\" Most of the eld abbeys were built on the margins of navigable streams, partly for the sake of the fishing and partly for the convenience of water carriage. The stone of which this and many other venerable structures were built is believed to have been brought from Caen in Normandy, and the source may be traced in an interesting journey by any traveller, who, should he be in the north of France, may find time for a ride through the country roads to the great quarries. Lesness Abbey flourished exceedingly for three hundred and forty-two years, and could not have failed to exercise a material influence over the early fortunes of the neighbouring parishes. The founder, however, had but a short seclusion of one year. De Lucy's Tomb and the Bay-tree.\u2014 Hasted, in his \"History * Thomas A Beckett was murdered at Canterbury seven years previously (December 20th, 1170). Although originally dedicated to St. Thomas A'Beckett, I find the abbey desenbed about 1393 as, \" The Abbey of St. Peter of Gemetesis.\" In the fourth year of Henry IV. (1404) we see the House of Commons charging \" the Abbot of Lesness\" with \"selling annuities to divers persons, and afterwards purchasing protections in order to defraud the buyers. t The \"constitutions\" were directed against the extravagant privileges of the elergy, who were said to have committed \" a hundred murders with impunity.\""], [169, "PLATE LVI.

Five hundred years later (1650), his remains were discovered in the ruins, wrapped in lead, and we read that the dis covery attracted great crowds to the spot from London and all around. The monument and re mains were again covered and a bay-tree was planted on the spot. All traces of the monument have now disappeared ; search was made for it about fifty years ago, but nothing found, and there is reason to fear that the bones of De Lucy and his old companions have been ruthlessly scattered, probably for the paltry gain of the old lead.

The bay-tree had disajqieared when Hasted wrote in 1798, but Dr. Stukely forty-five years earlier saw both the bay-tree and a respectable remnant of the ruins, which he has preserved for us in the illustration which appears at the head of this chapter (page 485). He also drew the above plan of the ruins. Describing the building from the remnant he saw, Dr. .Stukely says \u2014 There were two grand gateways into the first court. The building of the mansion house, or founder's seat, tbe major part of which is still left, is very good \u2014 stone below, timber stud-work above, a noble hall, with a grand roof of chestnut ; near the upper end is a very old-fashioned staircase, of much timber, but grand ; tbis leads up to the chantry and lodging rooms of the founder and his successors, the priors. The church is built of stone, but only the north wall remains. Of the cloisters on the south side, the outward wall alone is standing. There seems to have been a vault under the west end of the church ; south of the cloisters was the refectory or hall of the canons. The lodgings, kitchen, offices, and I suppose the sub-prior's apartment, have only the outward walls left. The whole area of the cloisters, lodgings, &c, is now a kitchen garden. Recent Devastation. \u2014 The ruins appear to have made rapid decay after Stukely's time. In 1801 they had become incorporated in farm buildings, and in 1844 the walls were nearly demolished to clear the ground for the present farmhouse. A man named Etheridge who was employed to carry out this demolition is still living at Beadonwell. Present Ruins. \u2014 Even this destruction was, however, not com plete, and there is still remaining to be seen part of the chapel wall with the arches of a few doors and windows. Mr. Walford, in \" Greater London,\" 1888, says \u2014 The wall that enclosed the convent garden is still standing, and at the south-"], [172, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 498 western corner is a doorway, probably dating from the time of Edward I which wa formerly the principal entrance to the abbey. The walls encircling the courtyard are in excellent preservation, and we can still admire the substantial masonry of the Ruins oj Lesness Abbey concerted into Farm Buildings. (From \"Pennant's Journey,\" 1801.) monks, than whom no more canny builders have ever existed. The stones of the building have been carted away piecemeal to mend the roads. The same authority says that De Lucy endowed the convent with the western moiety of Erith parish (now Belvedere), and his son Geoffrey, Bishop of Winchester, increased its possessions. Mr. .John Harris, in his recent work on Erith, has some lucid observations upon this subject, and seems to doubt the statement of Stukely that the north wall was standing in 1753, seeing that, Weever in 1630 describes the church as \" long buried in her own Lesness jlbbey. General View of the Ruins, looking West. ruins, and grown over with oak, elm and ash trees.\" He inclines, how ever, to regard Stukely's plan as correct, though many of the foundation walls have disappeared \u2014 buried in the ground. The present north wall of the church has few traces of the Norman windows seen in Stukely's"], [173, "PLUMSTEAD. 499 sketch, but there is still a bay-tree, which may be an offshoot from the ancient stem. Mr. Harris attributes the uneven state of the ground about the abbey to debris from the old buildings, and the deep hol- lows to the dig ging of gravel for road-making, and the forma - tion offish-ponds in the line of the old creek. His explanation, if accepted, dis poses of my Eoman dock con jecture. The Abbot's Thorn. \u2014The Lesness Abbey. Interior of tht Ruins. \"Abbot's Thorn\" is referred to by the same writer. It stands on a circular artificial eminence near the wood, and is of great age, but its name is only traditional, and history is mute upon its subject. It originally had two stems, and the one remaining is 6| feet in circum ference, sustaining a semicircular crown of 60 feet. The Old Barn. \u2014 The old barn adjacent Mr. Harris believes to have been co-eval with the building of the abbey, and therefore seven hundred years old. Its dimensions are 150 feet by 40 feet. The roof is strongly supported by timber, and at the sides of the doors are stout uprights, resting on solid masonry. I have heard this barn called \" Wolsey's Barn,\" and it is a local tradition that here the wily cardinal stabled his horse on his visits to Plumstead. The present farmhouse is erected on the site of the \" Founder's Mansion\" shown by the letters \"a. b. c. d.\" on Stukely's plan. The only ancient work left at this spot is the cellar, in which is an arched doorway, choked with rubbish. Modem Search. \u2014 In 1870, by permission of the farm-tenant, Mr. George Stapley, the ground within the ruins was thoroughly searched by Mr. P. 0. White, J.P., of Blackheath, excavations being made in places to the depth of 16 feet, but nothing of interest was discovered excepting a number of iron weapons, which were dug up in the cloisters. Scattered Remains. \u2014 The average height of the ruined walls is about 7 feet, but in several places they have been rebuilt and repaired with the old materials, fragments of the stone pillars being"], [174, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 500 seen built into the existing boundaries. It is probable that some of the stones from the abbey have been used for the restoration of Erith Church, and the present windows in the south aisle of that edifice are suspected of having been so derived. A Roman Settlement.\u2014 In the wood behind the old abbey, remains of a Roman road (which I take in support of my surmise as to the dock and its communication with London) are pointed out by Mr. Harris, commencing at the corner of Bostall Heath, and proceeding by the side of the present Woolwich Road, through Abbey Wood and Belvedere Park to Friday Hill. It is in the shape of a raised bank or ridge, and it passes close to an old iron-smelting furnace, which is believed to have been used by the Romans. More Old Roads. \u2014 The road may have been a branch extending to Erith Bay from that other old road which stretched across Plum stead, Woolwich, and Charlton to the Roman city of London. Traces of that road still exist in several places. Timbercroft Lane at the Slade on Plumstead Common is the westernmost fragment, and search ing eastward we find the little green lane pictured by Mr. Clifton at page 90, beyond which we come upon a'good substantial piece of the obsolete road \u2014 now leading nowhere \u2014 by the side of the new cemetery belong ing to Woolwich. Until about 1860, this section of the defunct high way was not far severed from another remnant, which, emerging from the Stony Hill, or Cloth-workers' Wood, had become a mere watercourse, discharging into Wickham Lane, near The Forester. Its shape can still be traced beside the stream at this spot, and a bit more of it goes away towards Bostall on the other side of Wickham Lane, but has at some later date been blocked and turned aside towards the Wood and the Chalk Caves. This old road, I am firmly convinced, was the main highway from Abbey Wood to London by the higher level, just as the road previously spoken of, by the margin of the river, was the lower road, from the earliest days almost until our own time. Abbey Wood Lane. \u2014 Mr. Clifton also gives us at page 501 an etching of a pretty bit of this lower road, which we traverse as we cross the fields from Plumstead Church to Abbey Wood. It lies close to Wyman's Farm House, but has no reason at all for existence save as a survival of ancient utility. It was formerly several feet wider, as may be seen by entering the field on the north side, where the stumps of the older hedge are visible. This morsel of dead highway is directly in line with the road at Abbey Wood, severed by one field only ; and, continued westward, it will exactly coincide with the relics which we discover north and west of Plumstead Church. Here we seem to trace the very footsteps of the ancient fishermen of Plumstead and Woolwich"], [175, "PLUMSTEAD. 501 as they took their Thames salmon to the abbots of Lesness Priory seven hundred years ago ! Timbercroft Lane. \u2014 A reference just now to Timbercroft Lane as an ancient road may be met with doubt, owing to the abrupt angle by which it is entered from the Slade. No road-makers, especially Roman, can be imagined to have made a highway with such a defect as that in it. But there is every reason to suppose that this awkward bend is a later diversion, to be accounted for in many ways, and it is .ibbey Wood Lan, evident that the physical character of the spot has been much altered, probably at various times, to overcome the difficulties of traffic across the head of the Slade ravine. The word \" croft \" was Saxon for a small field with a house in it, and there are signs of habitations, which have long ceased to be, having existed about the spot. High Grove Lane. \u2014 Old maps not only show the road distinctly, but branches out of it. One of these is High Grove Lane, which still exists almost in its entirety, although blocked up and overgrown by a"], [176, "502 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. wood, and it can be traced even on the farther side of the Dover Road through the Crown Woods to Eltham. A road almost parallel may be discovered leading southward from the meadow beyond Timbercroft Lane, with the site of a cottage or barn at the north-west corner. But we are wandering from Lesness Abbey and the locality of Abbey Wood, which teems with fascinations for such as love to linger over associations with the long forgotten past. The Monks of Old. \u2014 We may here, undisturbed, create anew in our mind's fancy the scenes of long ago. It would be injudicious, not to say unsafe, to put all one's fancies into print, but we may, without fear of doubt, imagine the broad shallows of the Thames washing the very skirts of the old monastery, and can picture the navigable creek which ran into the old dock or ravine close by. All the rest might be R mere poetic flight, but we may be permitted to borrow an illustration rom \" The Red Fisherman,\" by William Mackworth Praed The Abbot. (From \" The Pad Fislierman.\" ) The Abbot rose and closed his book, And donned his sandal shoon, And wandered forth alone to look LTpon the summer moon. Mr. Dunkin, the antiquary, writes: \u2014 Few locations were better adapted for the purposes of a monastic life than the site selected by De Lucy. The hills at the back of the priory garden were covered with a dense forest, called West Wood, and the monks, with all their self-denying habits, were good judges of the advantages of wood and water, and fully appreciated the delicate flavours of fish and fowl and venison. The barns in which the goodly prior stowed his sheaves and fruit rest on their original foundations, and the stews or"], [177, "503 TLUMSTEAD. fishponds are hard by on the east of the priory. But the whole area^of the church, cloisters, and lodgings of the monks is now a market-garden. From indications in the boundary wall it would appear that the church was about 40.feet wide by 97 feet in length, and that the tower, only about 17 feet square, abutted against the northern side, between tlie nave and the chancel. The following lines were written in 1835 by Mr. H. Mead, a young man of Woolwich, who afterwards had a successful literary career : \u2014 LESNESS ABBEY. Time-honoured hill ! Thy sight recall The scenes of other days, Tho' none within thy silent walls The songs of Zion raise ; Thy altars raz'd, thy shrines o'erthrown, The poet's pensive mind alone Its silent homage pays. The careless rustic passes by With heedless step and vacant eye. A thousand summer suns have shone Upon our favoured clime, A thousand years their shadows thrown Athwart the path of time .Since thou wert hail'd by pride or power ; And still the gloom of ages lower Around thy towers sublime. To fancy's eye, on every blast, The shades of old are sweeping past. The harp that thrilled in days of yore Is mute and voiceless now ; The hunter's song is heard no more Beneath the sorest bough, Where mirth would spend the livelong day, And joy each cloud would chase away From grandeur's careworn brow. Earth, woods, and skies are bright and gay, But priests and nobles \u2014 where are they ! Where are they ? Ask each record lone Which love hath planted there ; The blazon'd shield or sculptured stone Which tell that such things were, AVhich tell that they who sleep below Reck not of earthly weal or woe, Of earthly toil or care : That beauty's smile or minstrel's strain \"Will ne'er disturb their sleep again. And vanish'd, too, each holy shrine Where mighty monarch bow'd, And humbly Bought the power divine Beside the meaner crowd."], [178, "504 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. There conscience shook the sinner's breast There frailty its sins confest, And guilt its crimes avow'd, Whilst tones of rapture filled the air From those who found forgiveness there. 'Tis sad to think earth's noblest things, Dreamlike, must fade aw-ay ; That heroes, sages, bards, and kings Must blend with common clay. The pillar'd dome, the lowly cot, Alike must share the general lot And yield to dull decay : And all which charm'd the gazer's eye In ait will fade, in man must die. What we may see. \u2014 Enough has been said to prove that the neighbourhood of Abbey Wood teems with romantic and historical interest, and any one who is quietly and thoughtfully disposed may follow our facts and suggestions on the spot with infinite enjoyment. The wood and the ruins, although guarded against trespassers, are not inaccessible to polite inquirers, and Mr. Stapley, the worthy farmer who holds both in his possession, is my creditor for much disinterested courtesy and assistance. It is not necessary, however, to enter private grounds in order to see some of the vestiges and to construct an image of the past. Fragments of the north boundary wall of the courtyard are discoverable in the hedge by the roadside, and this same wall may be followed for a considerable distance west and south, while the eastern boundary is marked by a palpable grass-grown ridge, beneath which the crumbled wall lies buried. We may take it as conclusive that the road to Erith ran close to the Abbey grounds, and that the little lane which joins it at the western corner of the enclosure united it with the higher road of which we have spoken. At present the only seeming purpose of the side road is to form a back way to the farm and a junc tion with Knee Hill ; but, in point of fact, the road from the junction at Knee Hill down to Abbey Wood station is a modern invention. We may grant that it has been some sort of thoroughfare so long as it has been requisite for the farmers to go down by the Harrow Manorway to the marsh lands, but I use the term modern in its comparative sense ; and, to show that the road could not have existed in remote times, it is only necessary to point out that, a few years ago, about 1860, the surface of the roadway fell in and revealed an old and long-worked chalk-pit completely across it. Supposed Subterranean Passage. \u2014 There are several of these chalk-holes about the neighbourhood, and rumour says that they extend in a direct line between the abbey ruins and Plumstead Church, to mark the line of a subterranean passage. I have seen a flight of steps"], [179, "505 TLUMSTEAD. in the ruins descending until they are choked by debris, and I have surmised that they once led to the monks' cellar, though it may have been only to the crypt. I have also seen some deep holes in the wood, and set them down as obsolete wells, but although I have come across a recent statement that the subterranean passage is still in existence, I have never seen any proofs of the subterranean passage, and have no faith in it. The Dissolution. \u2014 A pleasant house and a beautiful home had the religious fathers of Lesness, and a quiet uneventful history was theirs until the despoiler came. This was in the year 1520. In that year Henry VIII. suppressed the lesser monasteries, and Lesness Abbey, if not entirely extirpated, was certainly deprived of its estates and revenues. For sixteen years longer the so-called \"Defender of the Faith\" spared the larger monasteries, and while he veiled his claws to them he also still kept up friendly relations with those whom he had robbed. Will Goldwyn. \u2014 In 1524, the same year in which he abrogated the Papal power, his Majesty was in correspondence with the abbots of St. Augustine's, Canterbury, and acknowledged their possession of lands at Plumstead by granting an injunction restraining Will Goldwyn, of Woolwich, who had obtained a lease from the abbot of St. Augustine's, Canterbury, of the woods at Plumstead .and Shooters' Hill, and, on pre tence of wanting fuel for bis brewhouse, not only refuses to sell any to the abbot's tenants, but has cut down timber wasteful]}-, in excess of his lease. But Henry himself was actuated by greed and selfishness no less than was the brewer, and when he scattered the monks and endowed his favoured colleges with their wealth, he undoubtedly took a goodly share of the spoil for his pains. If he had known the trouble they would have brought him, he would have left the Plumstead estates alone, but he found them rich and fruits ul under the fostering hands of the careful monks, and he laid his eager fingers upon an ample slice, as will be immediately shown."], [180, "Henry VIII. By Holbein. CHAPTER XLI ROYAL RECORDS OF PLUMSTEAD. Boughton and Thomas Cromwell. \u2014 On the sixteenth day of July, 1533, being in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of his most puissant Majesty King Henry VIII., Mr. Edward Boughton, who was the great man of Plumstead, wrote to Mr. Thomas Cromwell, secretary to Cardinal Wolsey, complaining that heavy arrears were due for the reclamation of the flooded marshes which were formerly owned by the abbey at Lesness, and asking that a bill for \u00a335 should be submitted to the king, \" who is,\" said Mr. Boughton, \" our great owner here and owes for 420 acres.\" This Mr. Boughton was ultimately \" clerk \" or agent at Plumstead, not only for the king, but for Wolsey and for Cromwell, besides havino; interests of his own to look after, and he contrived all through, not only to gain and maintain that uncertain thing, the royal favour, and become in time \" Sir Edward Boughton,\" but also to accumulate much wealth. He resided first at Burwash Court, the ancient Hall of the Burrage estate, and afterwards acquired the broad manor of Southall at Woolwich, and occupied the manorial dwelling which subsequently became Bowater House. But his riches and influence had small beginnings, and he had a somewhat unpleasant, if profitable,"], [181, "PLUMSTEAD. 507 method of gathering in his savings. It is clear that neither the King nor his agent were much loved at Plumstead. A letter of the same date just quoted (July 16th, 1533), and probably enclosed within the same cover, was written by Thomas Fuller, a bailiff or overseer of works, informing Mr. Boughton that the work of recovering the marsh lands did not go on well, and that the Plumstead workmen \" care neither for clerke nor any man else.\" This was the news which Mr. Thomas Cromwell received from Plumstead on or about the 16th July, 1533. Two days later he had another message from Boughton propos ing a commission of sewers for the safety of the marshes, and expressing his fears that \" both the Plumstead and Lesenes lands are in danger.\" He is so much engaged, he says, in the inning of the marshes that he cannot attend to those who owe money for divers cesses. Writing again to Cromwell on the 24th of the same month, he says : \u2014 I beg you to remember the commission for the weal of this country bere. The poor labourers are unpaid for six weeks. Cannot get a penny of \u00a3250 owing by divers owners, among others by the monastery of Westminster. If not paid no work can be done. It is time to know- what should be clone about the measurement of the lands at Lesenes, or else the ditches cannot be made in convenient time to drain them, ami without them the marshes cannot be sown and pastured. And more to the same effect which need not be quoted. But here we see how nearly our local records run on parallel lines with the history of England. Wolsey and Cromwell. \u2014 This Thomas Cromwell was a wonderful man, who has left his mark even on the broadly seamed chapter of a memorable time. Originally the son of a mechanic, he raised himself by his talents and audacity to be the right hand of Cardinal Wolsey, and managed so well as to retain the King's favour after the fall of his master, and to rise to the rank of Earl of Essex. He is most familiar to later generations by his conspicu ous share in the passage of Shakespeare's Henry VIII. which recounts the fall of Wolsey : \u2014 Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex. Wolsey. \u2014 Go, get thee from me, Cromwell I am a poor fallen man, unworthy now"], [182, "508 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. To be thy lord and master.

Neglect him not ; make use now and provide For thine own future safety. Cromwell. \u2014 Oh, my lord, Must I then leave you . must I needs forego So good, so noble, and so true a master ? Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord. The king shall have my service, but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours. Wolsey. \u2014 Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries ; but thou has fore'd me Out of thy honest truth to play the woman. Oh ! Cromwell, Cromwell ! Had I but served my God with half the zeal I serv'd my king, he would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies. A Friend at Court. \u2014 Thomas Cromwell, however, had scarcely emerged from obscurity when he and Boughton were first acquaint. As early as 1520, the year in which Lesness Abbey was disestablished, and Wolsey was at the height of his power, with a young secretary just comma: into notice, Mr. Boughton had discovered the influence of the \u00a9 i o Cardinal's favourite, and addressed a letter to \"the Right Worshipful Mr. Cromwell,\" soliciting favour for his niece, Anne Banastre, and begging him to ask Wolsey to call her and her husband before him, and require the man to give his wife an \"honest living out of her own.\" The relationship which at this time existed between Boughton and the secretary, as well as the pecuniar}' circumstances in which both were placed, is indicated by some expressions in this same letter, for the writer is \"sorry that he cannot make Mr. Cromwell a sufficient recom pense,\" but will \" always be glad to do him pleasure.\" Though his \"substance be drowned\" (i.e. in the marshes), he offers to give Crom well \" some wood for his chamber or other pleasure.\" And in another letter of about the same date, in which he asks \" Master Cromwell \" to obtain for him five pounds due to him from the late lord of Lesness Abbey on account of timber, he suggests without the slightest show of delicacy that Cromwell shall \" keep a noble out of the money to buy a pickerel * for himself and his wife.\" Cromwell's Perquisites. \u2014 Cromwell was at no time, even in his * Pickerel : a small pike. Possibly Boughton may have meant \" pickadill,\" a piece of embroidery worn round the neck or edge of a garment. A noble was a gold coin worth about 7s. 6d."], [183, "509 PLUMSTEAD. prosperity, above receiving gifts from men, and fourteen years after wards, when Wolsey was dead, and his protege, taking his master's place at the King's right hand, had become Secretary of State and Vicar- General of the whole Church, the Abbot of Canterbury, in sending him a pleading letter, thought it needful to say that the \" marsh of Plum stead \" had so impoverished him of money and jewels that he was unable to recompense Cromwell's goodness \" except by prayer.\" Division of Spoil. \u2014 From the letters quoted and collateral testi mony it is evident that Henry, while appropriating most of the Plum stead and Lesness estates to himself and his creatures, made some show of endowing with the land and its revenues the ecclesiastical colleges at Westminster and Canterbury, but he appears nevertheless to have kept the best of the property for himself and left the poor churchmen but a sorry inheritance. And finally when, in 1537, he dissolved the larger monasteries, and ruthlessly pillaged the cathedral at Canterbury, he swept into his own possession everything worth possessing. Local Wrath. \u2014 The suppression of the monasteries was everywhere unpalatable to the masses of the people, for, whatever may have been their abuses, these institutions were unquestionably means of benevolence, and therefore reverenced by the pious and the poor. Before Boughton took control of the stolen property Cromwell sent one Stephen Vaughan down to Plumstead to make a report. This was in 1528, two years before the death of Wolsey. Vaughan found the inhabitants in a highly resentful mood, and his first report to Cromwell was that he had sur veyed the lands of the late monastery, but was quite unable to discover the six hundred acres of marsh belonging to it. Ho added a remark that \" the people here are so obstinate that they were four days finding a man to show the lands in Plumstead belonging to the manor.\" Robert Cokys. \u2014 The King himself did something to conciliate the incensed villagers by little attentions. There was, for instance, a revel at Greenwich Palace on the 10th of November, 1527, and the expenses sanctioned by the King included the sum of 5s. 4d. paid to \" Robert Cokys,* of Plomsted,\" for birch and maple boughs. Cromwell at Plumstead. \u2014 Wolsey, disgraced by his sovereign, broke his heart in 1530, and Cromwell, as we know, stepped into his shoes. He appears to have been occasionally at Plumstead, inspecting the operations in progress for the redemption of the flooded lands, and on such occasions he was presumably the guest of Boughton. In a letter to him of December Sth, 1532, his Plumstead friend asks \u2014 Cokys is old English for \"Cook\" or \"Cox.\""], [184, "510 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Will it suit you to be at Lesenes on Monday or Tuesday to view the King's lands ? If so, I most heartily require you to take a breakfast in my poor lodging overnight if it shall please you. Dated at Woolwich, Our Lady Day, the Conception. Cromwell's Fall. \u2014 The fickle King was longer tiring of Cromwell than of other of his tools, for Cromwell was undoubtedly a man of extraordinary gifts, faithful and useful to his unscrupulous lord. But in January, 1540, the minister unfortunately advised Henry's marriage with Anne of Cleves, his fourth wife, to whom the King always enter tained an aversion. Notwithstanding this mistake Cromwell for some time longer appeared to retain the royal confidence. It was at this period (1540), he received the title of Earl of Essex, and was installed Knight of the Garter, but in the same year his enemies, seeing their opportunity, rose against him and compassed his disgrace. An absurd and utterly improbable series of charges of treason and heresy were framed, and, notwithstanding the absence of proofs and his earnest supplications to the King, Cromwell, Earl of Essex, was executed on July 28th, 1540. He was mourned by none, for the nobles despised his low extraction, while the people blamed him as the author of all the ills that had befallen the national faith. In a ballad of 1540, preserved by the Society of Antiquaries, we have a trace of the opinions entertained by King Henry's subjects in general : \u2014 Although Lord Crumwell a traytour was, Yet dare I saye that the Kynge of his Grace Hath forgyven him that gret trespas. To rayle than on dead men thou art to blame Trolle now into the way agayne for shame. The villagers of Plumstead and Lesness, having little for which to thank either Lord Cromwell or his patron, may have sung this song with a leer at the notion of the brutal King forgiving his victim after he had killed him. The King at Plumstead. \u2014 There is no certain evidence of King Henry VIII. having visited Plumstead, but it is positive from collateral circumstances that he was well acquainted with the estates which he had pilfered from the monks. It would have been well for him had he given them more supervision or employed more trusty agents, for it happened by want of care that the river seriously broke in upon the marshes in 1537, and, being but feebly resisted, swept over barrier after barrier until two thousand acres of land were once more under water. The energy which was needed to check or prevent this misfortune was also wanting for the greater effort to repair it. True, the King once gave \u00a37 out of his own pocket to a French friar who proposed a plan for recovering his land sunken at Plumstead, but nothing practical came of tbis or any other suggestion during Henry's reign."], [185, "511 PLUMSTEAD.

It is on record that \u2014 Sir Edward Boughton, son of Nicholas, obtained 29th October, 1541, a license for himself, his wife Joan, and their son and heir-apparent, Nicholas, to alienate 120 acres of marsh land in Plumstead, late of the abbey of St. Augustine, Canterbury, a part of Burwash Grove in Plumstead, late parcel ofthe suppressed House of Aeon, Lond., and other lands, to Sir Martin Bowes. Sir Edward Boughton undoubtedly acquired great wealth, chiefly, we may suppose, from bis management of the estates at Plumstead belonging to the State and to himself. He was a man, also, of much influence, and \" little king \" of both Woolwich and Plumstead. The transaction just mentioned with Sir Martin Bowes forms another con necting link between the histories of the two towns. Elizabeth to the Rescue.\u2014 Henry VIII. died in 1547, and the two next reigns are a local blank. But an entry (Dec., 1559) in the State papers of Elizabeth states that Acontine (alias Giacopo Acontis of Trent) had an annuity of \u00a363 for work done in the reclamation of Plumstead marshes. He was naturalized in 1561, and was com missioned to employ workmen in further operations in 1563, in which year it was reported to Parliament that, notwithstanding per petual care and great expenditure upon the river wall, there were 2,000 acres lying in Plumstead, Lesness, and Erith \" which were in former times good pasture ground and meadows, now laid waste within these thirty years by breaches and the inundation of the Thames ; \" but that \"Jacobus Acontyas,\" an Italian and servant to the Queen, had undertaken at his own charges their recovery in consideration of a moiety thereof, but that the lords and owners thereof were many and their consent could not be procured. It was therefore enacted that the said Jacobus should within four years after 10th of March, 1562, fence in and win the said ground or any part thereof, to have one moiety thereof as recompense. In the eighth year of Elizabeth (1566) a commission reported that Jacobus had won and inned 600 acres from the water and flood ; but shortly afterwards this was lost by the violence of the floods, and he was assisted by a company of London citizens to recover the same at a cost of \u00a3'5,000. Several continuing acts were passed in the same reign for recovering more land, and in 1587 there was an inning: of 1,000 acres more, leaving about 500 acres next Lesness still under water. The R,iver Wall.\u2014 For centuries together the records of Plum stead hover about the marshes, and are interesting only so far as they connect our little stream of local life with the broad current of English history. But we must allow that in creating and maintaining the river K K 2"], [186, "512 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. wall our ancient predecessors have left us a wonderful work and sub stantial inheritance. It would be well if we could clear up the doubt which remains as to the first builders of the embankment ; it would be something if the authorities were only agreed in opinion upon the point. But they are altogether at variance. Sir William Dugdale, Sir Christopher Wren, and others), adopt the Roman theory, and some who dispute this view refuse also to believe that the bank was originally made by the abbots of Lesness and Stratford in the twelfth century, though most of them accept the suggestion. Our friend, Mr. Hewitt, musing hereabout, wrote \u2014 This wonderful work, now generally attributed to the Romans, may be well studied in these marshes. Roman temples and Roman amphitheatres sink into insignificance in comparison with this gigantic tide-barrier. The probable Builders. \u2014 With the most respectful submission I would suggest the more simple and probable conjecture that tbe marshes were enclosed piecemeal by the owners ofthe adjoining lands, whether they were Saxon farmers or Norman monks, long subsequent to the C\u00e6sars, and yet before the foundation of Lesness Abbey. In the first place there is no proof whatever of their early recovery, and the silence of the Domesda}- Book on the subject, already mentioned, is at least significant. The traces of several embankments which are found in the ridges and mounds all about the marshes, and the various \" levels \" by which the land is now drained, are undoubtedly the marks of successive endeavours, and, although they afford no clue to their actual or relative dates, they certainly coincide with the theory of fragmentary reclamation. There are no statutes bearing on the subject prior to the reign of Henry II. , but works of embankment appear to have been thought of in his time (between 1154 and 1189). Then we learn that in 1279 the abbots of Lesness enclosed a \" great part of their marshes at Plum stead ; \" and in the reign of Henry III. (1216-72) a commission was formed for \" overseeing and repairing the breeches, walls, ditches, &c, in divers places between Greenwiche and Wulwiche.\" The Charlton marshes, which are here meant, appear, however, on the whole, to have occasioned little trouble, most of the difficulties which made the river wall a State question for many generations having arisen in reference to the marsh lands at Plumstead on the one side of the river and Dasen ham on the other. By whomsoever the work of embankment was per formed it is certain that it was for centuries an ecclesiastical charg-e, and that its maintenance rested upon the monasteries. Most of the religious fraternities throughout the land appear to have contributed to the outlay, and the \" Taxatio Ecclesiastica \" of 1291 shows that many of"], [187, "513 PLUMSTEAD. them held property at Plumstead, probably on account of advances made to the local monastery of Lesness. These evidences do not go far to establish the period at which the river wall was built or identify its founders, but, in the absence of any mention in history of a work which must, if performed at one time, have involved immense labour and skill, and in the presence of re ferences which deal with reclamations only, I submit as feasible the hypothesis of gradual enclosure during and just prior to the reigns of the early Plantagenets in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Reclaimed at last. \u2014 Through all the statutes down to the reign of James I. enactments appear relating to the Thames wall and the marshes. The last act of all these enabled William Burrell, of Middle sex, to complete in 1606 the work which several companies had attempted on the promise of a grant of the rescued lands for their own View from the River at Plumstead Marshes, 1820. benefit. We have seen something of the anxiety and expense involved in the operations, and a contemporary description is given by Lambarde, who, writing in 1590, says \u2014 In the 14th, 23rd, and 27th years of her Majesty's reign '(her Majesty Queen Elizabeth) the Lesser Breache was stopped and therewith 500 acres rescewed from the river. After that, in 1587 there was an inning of 1,000 acres more. The Great Breache is not yet made up, wdiereby 500 acres or thereabout next Lyesness are still maistered by the water ; but so it daily giveth way and filleth up the land with residence or bottome, wliich giveth hope that the same may also, within short time, and withe no greate coste, be made sounde and sweete lande againe. The great and the lesser breaches here mentioned are clearly shown in the old maps, and are conspicuous on the plan of the Thames in 1588, which appears in connection with a previous subject at page 298. Since 1606 the inroads of the river have been stayed and there have been no more floods worth mention. The repair of the bank and the care of the marsh ditches have been carried out by a commission entitled the Commissioners of the Dartford Level, just as on the other side of the river there has been a Commission of the Dagenham Level."], [188, "514 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. All the land which was inundated has had to pay \" wall-scot \" dues for the expenses of the necessary works. (See page 493.) Descent of the Manor of Plumstead. \u2014 We may now take up another clue and trace the means by which King Henry's lands, together with a great part of Plumstead, including Bostall Heath and Plumstead Common, came into possession of Oxford University. We are familiar already with Sir Edward Boughton, the King's clerk and local agent, who managed the estates which Henry filched from the monks of Lesness Abbey ; and we have seen that he stood well in the favour of the sovereign as well as of the royal instrument, Thomas Cromwell. Then we learn that on the dissolution of the monastery of St. Augustine at Canterbury, which happened on the 30th July in the thirtieth year of this king (1538), the manor and church of Plumstead became vested in the Crown, but on the 20th January, 1539, the King granted to Sir Edward Boughton \" the manor and parsonage, tythes, occ, within the parishes and villages of Plumstead, Bostall, Wickham, Welling, Woolwich, Bexley, Lesseness, Erith, and Yard, alias Crayford, and the advowson of the vicarage of Plumstead, and of the chapel of Wickham thereunto annexed.\" Also King Henry VIII. in his thirty-third year granted to Boughton 120 acres of marsh land, then covered with water, in Plum stead, adjoining northward to 50 acres of Martin Bowes. This property Sir Edward contrived to increase so well that when he died the estate included 4 messuages, 40 acres of arable land, 500 acres of marsh, 80 acres of pasture, and 500 acres of wood, all in Plum stead. And he had other possessions also. Sir Edward Boughton's will, preserved in Doctor's Commons, speaks of his lands, tenements, &c, at Plompsted, Wolwiche, Myceham (Wickham?), Wellynge, Borscall (Bos tall ?), Bexley, Eryst (Erith), and \"Crayford, otherwise called Yard.\" He mentions his chief mansion house in Woolwich, and his \" lordship's manor \" likewise. The estates continued in his family by descent until 1656, when they were sold to John Michel of Richmond, Surrey, who, by his will, dated December 21st, 1736, devised this manor of Plumstead to the provost and scholars of Queen's College, Oxford, for the main tenance of eight master fellows and four bachelor scholars, with allow ances of \u00a350 and \u00a330 a year respectively, the surplus to be laid out in the purchase of livings. The recent sale of the Plumstead Commons and Shoulder-of-Mutton Green at Wickham to the Metropolitan Board is therefore directly associated with the confiscations of \"bluff King Hal.\" Queen Bess at Plumstead. \u2014 Of Henry's royal daughter, Eliza beth, we have a remarkable record in connection with a visit which she paid to Plumstead."], [189, "515 PLUMSTEAD. Remembering the early unimportance of Plumstead, it is of some con sequence to find that the sovereign of these realms was a visitor here more than three hundred years ago. It was in 1573, a period in which our \" good Queen Bess \" was at the height of her popularity, having by her wisdom and frugality placed the nation in such a position as it had probably never before enjoyed, and her Majesty's journeys were so many triumphal processions. In July of the year just named, Eliza beth was at Orpington for three days, the guest of Sir Percival Hart, and on one of these days she made an excursion into Plumstead, eight Queen Elizabeth in \"Procession.\" miles distant, to see her well-beloved and trusty councillor, Thomas Fisher. Thomas Fisher. \u2014 This gentleman, who is mentioned in a previous record as clerk or bailiff employed under Boughton in the management of the king's estates, was secretary to the Duke of Somerset, who was Lord Protector in the reign of young Edward VI., and probably held some other service in the reigns of Mary and Elizabeth. The old historian, Dugdale, represents Fisher as having been \u2014 \"As greedy of Church Lands as other Courtiers were,\" observing that \"he"], [190, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWHCH DISTRICT. 516 swallowed divers large morsels, whereof Bishop's Ichington was one ; he made an absolute depopulation of that part called Nether Ichington, where the Church stood (which he also pulled down for the building of a large manor-house in its room) ; and t > perpetuate his memory changed the name of it to Fisher's Ichington. He had also a manor-house at Plumstead, and much of the land in the parish which had been seized by the late King Henry had appa rently come to his share. He was pretty well to do, and on the occasion of the royal visit he presented her Majesty with a ball of gold, with a cover, having a lion standing on the top, crowned, and holding the Queen's arms. Elizabeth\u2014 and, for that matter, kings and queens in general\u2014 felt no qualms in receiving valuable presents from their sub jects or any one else, and the more valuable the gifts the more they were welcome to the virgin queen. It is not improbable that ber visit to Plumstead may have been closely connected with her estates, and that Fisher managed them as honestly as he could in conjunction with his own. Some of the properties mentioned in the following extract from the R.olls may, perhaps, be traced in existing leases : \u2014 \" In Easter Term, in the 17th year of Queen Elizabeth\" (two years after the visit just mentioned), \" Thomas Fisher levied a fine of bis lands in Plumstead ; and in the \u25a021st year of that reign, he had the Queen's licence to alienate two parcels of wood, one palled the ' Little Grove,' containing by estimation 12 acres, and the other called ' Shur land,' containing 10 acres, and 15 acres of marsh in the ' New Marsh ' in Plumstead.\" Thomas Fisher is believed to have been a relative of John Fisher, the famous Bishop of Rochester who, alone among all the bishops, refused to acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of King Henry VIII., and was cast into the Tower, where, after a cruel captivity, he was executed on the 17th of June, 1535. The conscientious old bishop has left some admirable works on religious subjects, and also a record of the dissolu tion of the monastery at Abbey Wood (described in his register as \" Leesons \"), in which he seems to have taken a natural interest. The Old Manor House. \u2014 Now, where was John Fisher's house, which was thus honoured by the virgin queen ? The probabilities are against \" Burrage Place,\" for Fisher's name is not in the cate gory of occupiers so circumstantially chronicled by Phillipot in 1659. It is more feasible to conjecture that as his demesne lay in the eastern or marsh section of the parish he would have resided within his manor, and this reflection brings us to the Old Manor House in Wickham Lane. In the decrepit and many-angled structure which now serves for two poor cottages, we may see the remnant or suc cessor of a much more spacious dwelling \u2014 successor, perhaps, of an earlier house ; and here John Fisher may have received tbe good Queen Bess in 1573. Names and traditions, as we have before remarked, are not reliable, but they may be taken for what they are worth, and it will probably be granted that the title of \" the Old"], [191, "517 PLUMSTEAD. Manor House,\" which these cottages still bear, did not come to them by accident. Yet legendary fallacies do sometimes grow out of mere imagination, and I have had this very structure pointed out to me as the house in which King Alfred burnt the cakes, which, of course, is the purest fiction. It is also sometimes spoken of as \" Wolsey's House,\" and \" the Pilgrim's House,\" descriptions we can easily account for but cannot clearly reconcile. Elizabeth's Progresses.\u2014 The distinct record of Queen Eliza beth's visit to Plumstead, which we have from the Itinerary of \"Royal Uld Manor House in Wickham Lane, 1886. Progresses,\" is the more remarkable seeing that her Majesty, though born and resident at Greenwich, is not reported to have visited the greater town of Woolwich more than once. The probabilities, however, are, that as many of the war-ships built in her reign were produced at Woolwich, she was many times a visitor. The chronicles extant state that she was often at Eltham, and Nicholls has a record of her having passed in one of her processions over \" Monteni sagittariorum \" (or \"Shooters' Hill\"). A Queen's Character. \u2014 Lest we should seem to judge too hastily"], [192, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 518 the character of Queen Elizabeth from the gift aforesaid, we may quote her biographer and defender, Lucy Aitkins, who says \u2014 Rigid parsimony, at once the virtue and the foible of Elizabeth, was attended withits \"ood and its evil. It endeared her to the people, whom it protected from the imposition of new and oppressive taxes ; but, being united, rn the complex character of this remarkable woman, with an extraordinary taste for magnificence in all that related to her personal appearance, it betrayed her into a thousand meannesses, which, in spite of all the arts of graciousness, in which she was an adept served to alienate the affections of such as more nearly approached her. Her nobles found themselves heavily burthened by the long and frequent visits which she paid them at their country seats, attended always by an enormous retinue, as well as by the contributions to her jewelry and wardrobe which custom required of them under the name of New Year's gifts, and on all occasions when they had favours, or even justice, to ask at her hands. There were few of the inferior suitors and court attendants composing the crowd by which she had a vanity in seeing herself con stantly surrounded who did not find cause bitterly to rue the day when first her hollow smiles and flattering speeches seduced them to long years of irksome, servile, and often profitless assiduity. Lists of the New Year's gifts received by Elizabeth show that not only jewels, trinkets, rich robes, and every ornamental article of dress were abundantly supplied to her from this source, but that sets of body linen worked with black silk round the bosom and sleeves were regarded as no inappropriate offerings from peers of the realm to the maiden queen. The presents of the bishops and of some of the nobility always consisted of gold pieces, to the value of from five to twenty or thirty pounds, contained in embroidered silk purses. Sir John Perrott. \u2014 Among the associations in which we find the name of Elizabeth connected with this locality is one of especial interest relating to Sir John Perrott, Bart., who became Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland. He was distinguished as a warrior and statesman during the reigns of the later Tudors, and seems to have been one ofthe favourites of the capricious Queen. He is the subject of some biographies* and poems, and a characteristic in cident of his life is illustrated by Sir John Perrott, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, 1584. (From an early engraving.) Miss Landon, the \" L.E.L.\" of a past generation. The Queen had sent him a jewelled scarf on his setting * See \"Government of Ireland under the Honourable, Just, and AVise Governor, Sir John Perrot, Knight, 15S4 ; printed at the signe of the Eagle and Childe, London, 1626.\""], [193, "519 PLU1ISTEAD. sail from Greenwich upon one of his early enterprises, and his ship appears to have got about as far as Woolwich when the royal gift reached his band ; but, with the chivalry characteristic of the age, he turned back, in order to don the gem in his sovereign's presence. The Queen was on the terrace of her palace at Greenwich :\u25a0 \u2014 \" Good omen, such a morn as this,\" her grace of England said ; \" What progress down our noble Thames hath Sir John Perrott made . \" * * * * * \" Nosv, by my troth,\" exclaimed the queen, \" it is our captain's bark ! What brings the loiterer back again * \" Her eye and brow grew dark. \" Fair queen,\" replied a voice below, \" I pay a vow of mine, \u2014 And never yet was voyage delay'd by worship at a shrine.\" He took the jewel in his hand, and bent him on his knee ; Then flung the scarf around his neck, where all the gem might see. \" Now, fare thee well,\" then said the queen, \"for thou art a true knight.' But even as she spoke the ship was flitting from the sight. Wo to the Spaniards, and their gold amid the Indian seas, When rolled the thunder of that deck upon the southern breeze ; For bravely Sir John Perrott bore our flag across the main, And England's bells for victory rang when he came home again. From the Roll of Battle Abbey we learn that a Perrott came from Normandy with the Conqueror, many of whose officers were of British birth, and he one. It need not be added that the lineal descendants of the family have long been residents of Plumstead. The Stuart Period. \u2014 Royal references to Plumstead grow meagre during- the reigns which followed the death of Elizabeth, and the parish had an almost uneventful calm of more than two hundred years. During the Civil War and subsequent troubles its people probably were as much disturbed as others, but those painful experiences have not left any permanent marks upon the records. The following episode is scarcely worth mention as an incident of a most disastrous reign. On May 26th, 1640, King Charles I. sent despatches to Sir Thomas Walsingham and Thomas Blount, justices for Kent, ordering search of the house of Mr. Musgrave, at Plumstead, his Majesty having been informed that there were there to be found a great proportion of arms, powder and ammunition, and a great number of men. But the search revealed only a short carbine, a pistol, and some swords, and the justices' report satisfied the King and Council that Plumstead at least was loyal."], [194, "The Old Mill, Plumstead Common, in 1820. CHAPTER XLII. RURAL RECORDS OF PLUMSTEAD. A Plan of Old Plumstead. \u2014 -Before proceeding farther it will be convenient to introduce a trusty witness to give evidence with respect to the circumstances of Plumstead in the early part of the last century. It is a plan of the parish, carefully drawn and well preserved, and now in possession of Mr. George Russell, of the Manor House in this parish. This most interesting map bears no date, but I do not think there is any difficulty in fixing the period at which it was prepared. I venture to ascribe it to as early a date as 1720, and for several reasons. In the first place I find that Sir John Leigh, whose residence is shown near Wickham Church, died in 1737;* secondly, there are rating charges against Sir John Leigh (and others here mentioned) in the vestry books of 1720 ; thirdly, there is an entry in the churchwardens' accounts of * His son, and only child, became Sir Francis Leigh and died in the lifetime of his father without issue. The father of Sir John Leigh was Mr. John Lee in 1684, but subsequently became Sir John Leigh. On the death of the second Sir John his will was disputed and set aside by the House of Lords, and the estates fell to the Leigh-Bennetts and others."], [195, "[To face page 520.] Plan of Plumstead about 1720. PLATE LVII."], [196, ""], [197, "PLUMSTEAD. 521 \u00a33 10s. paid in 1712 to Mr. Hawkins for \" a year's rent of the alms houses ; \" * and fourthly, I have been able by the help of Mr. W. G. Dawson to trace the Mrs. Parsons whose name appears on the south border of Plumstead Common. In the year 1722 this spot, which is now \" the Pottery,\" and lands around it were left by the will of Hester Parsons to her grandson, Charles Acton, son and heir of her son, Robert Acton, and were described as late in the tenure of Henry Hailstone. The descendant of Charles Acton sold the estate to John Smith, who sold it to John Giles, July 3rd, 1 804, and Giles sold it to Mr. W. Dawson on March 16th, 1816. We may then, in testing other circumstances by the map, conclude, without much doubt, that the map itself represents Plumstead as it was in 1720. The map was probably prepared for Mr. .Iohn Michel (who died about 1736), to show his estate in the Manor of Plumstead. It is wanting in some details, large portions of the parish in which the Manor had no concern being left blank, f and roads in which it had no interest being cut short in a tantalising manner, but it is tolerably clear and apparently reliable so far as it goes, and it furnishes us with some interesting facts. I make the following notes : \u2014 Near the Warren gate (1) stood Burrage House, not shown here. That it existed is beyond all question, but Queen's College in this sketch ignores most of its neighbours. The land of Sir John Conyers was added to the Warren about the middle of last century. The house on the north side of Plumstead Road occupies the position of the store keeper's residence. It may have been the residence of Sir John Conyers. The long road marked (2) is now called Vicarage Road, and has borne the names of Deadman's Lane and Brambleberry Lane. At (3) is the head of Griffin Manorway. Here is now Plumstead Railway Station. I can find no trace or remembrance now of either The Hare or the Almshouses. Water Lane (4) is now Cage Lane. A brook from Plumstead Common Slade ran across the high road. The plan at this spot is a little obscure, owing to a crease, and I can only conjecture that three houses or the Three Horses Inn stood here. At the foot of Skittles Lane (5) is now the White Hart Estate. The White Hart, a tavern, was burnt down about eighty j-ears ago.J The Vicarage is now the Volunteer Inn. * The discovery that there were almshouses at Plumstead, founded, occupied, decayed, vanished, and forgotten long before we were born, is certainly a surprise. + The great void south of Plumstead Common and other tracts in this parish were then, as now, the property of the Clothworkers' Company. As early as 1366, in the reign of Edward III., the Manor of Plumstead-Upland was held by Robert Erith, Gent., and was conveyed by him to Bartholemew de Burghesh, together with Bur wash Grove and other lands in Plumstead. The property afterwards passed to Sir Martin Bowes, and was transferred by his son Thomas to George and John Barne, of Woolwich, from whose descendants it was purchased by the Clothworkers. The Manor of Borstall or Bostall, here called Boston, passed to them about the same time. X Old inhabitants recollect the remains of the Wliite Hart standing back in the meadow, one hundred yards from the present readjust where the aged tree stood not many years since, and where we now find the centre of Kentmere Road. The house was burnt down about 1810."], [198, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 522 A large house, having the appearance of an old inn, even then spoken of as the Greyhound, stood at the corner of Skittles Lane until about 1865. The rain-water spouts were inscribed \" T.W.E., 1644.\" The roads at Cage Lane and Skittles Lane were as we find them to-day. At (8) is the Slade, with the branch roads, King's Highway and Timbercroft Lane, diverging therefrom. King's Highway (9) is unchanged. The indistinct road (10), now obsolete, has left remains near Woolwich Cemetery. Swingate Lane (11), extending to Wickham, is now nearly extinct. The Glebeland is the site of Speranza Street. The Feathers Tavern is still extant. Hog-trough Lane is now a footpath through land called \"Little Bartletts.\" The old name would lie appropriate still. The Old Manor House is shown in Wickham Lane. \"Boston Common\" is a palpable error. The place was known as \"Borstal\" many generations before this map was drawn. Stroud Green (12) is now known as \" Shoulder- of- \"Mutton Green.\" The Catherine JVheel at Shooters' Hill is lost in the gloom of the past. The house opposite was probably a mansion, and afterwards became the Bull Hotel. Plum Lane and Shrewsbury \u00a3ane (13), which undoubtedly constituted an old thoroughfare, do not appear upon the map. The figure (6) marks the stream which bounds Plumstead at Brook Hill Road and (7) Woolwich Common. Plumstead Landowners. \u2014 The Clothworkers' Company still owns a large estate at Plumstead. The land shown in the plan as belonging to the New England Company was only part of tho possessions of that company in 1720. Some at least of the estate, including the piece next Bostall Heath, is in the same ownership still, but the company is now called the \" Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.\" Village Rule. \u2014 At the Greyhound the parish officers appear to have been accustomed to bold their business meetings. They have left a record that they did so in 1715 to settle the bread charity, on which occasion they spent upon themselves the sum of ten shillings. It was not unusual for the whole of those inhabitants who met in the vestry to adjourn for refreshment after labour, and in 1700 and there about we find in the accounts sundry entries, such as, \" Spent at the Vestry, 7s. ;\" once 13s. 9d., and once as much as \u00a31 10s. The expense of the perambulation in 1720 was \u00a36 6s. The overseers seem to have bad no poor of their own to maintain in 1700, but they relieved sundry destitute persons passing through the parish, among whom we read of \"seven disabled soldiers with passes,\" who received 3s. ; and eleven sailors released from slavery, for whom ls. was thought enough. In looking over the vestry books of this period we mark the absence of the surname : \" Gave to Will ye cobler, 5s.;\" and still more vague is \"Paid to thedoctoress woman, 10s.\" About 1720 Plumstead had a species of beadle in John Allberry, who was paid 10s. every half-year for looking after the boys in church ; and"], [199, "523 PLUMSTEAD. in 1720 Plumstead was still ahead of Woolwich and Charlton in its assessment, for the following was the annual value of the tithes \u00a3 s. d.

Charlton . . . .780 Eltham 2 6 0 Wild Beasts at Plumstead. \u2014 We have shown that in the primitive maps of Kent, a river or stream appears running into the Thames from East Wickham.* Was it in this water that the sports men of Plumstead hunted the otter in bygone days, or in the Thames itself ? Salmon, which is the otter's dainty dish, is known to have abounded in the Thames, but the river of the Wickham Lane Valley would naturally have its fishery. The parish officers paid a reward of a shilling for every otter that was destroyed, and I find several such payments in the \"Book for the Chvrchwardens of Plvmstead, 1701.\" The like compensation was paid for the head of a fox, of which nine were slaughtered in the year just named, and there was also one badger, for which the like reward of one shilling was paid. The \"British bear,\" then, was not unknown at Plumstead in 1701. Pole cats and hedgehogs were extirpated at the rate of fourpence each, the latter under the absurd suspicion of milking the cows. .Something of the same superstition and prejudice haunted the rural mind as recently as 1835, when we read that the \"Plumstead Sparrow Club\" was in a flourishing state, and that every member who did not send in to the treasurer six dead sparrows every week was rigorously fined. Coroner Tasker. \u2014 Amongst the relics of the last century I have seen a coroner's warrant of 1731, quaintly written as follows : \u2014 Kent Co. \u2014 John Tasker, coroner. \u2014 To the minister and Church Wardens of the Pailsh of Plumstead, in the county aforesaid and every of them.

It was a small affair, as shown in the sketch here given. I cannot find any living person who remembers the workhouse at this spot, but there are many who knew its successor, built of its old materials, at Cage Lane, just where Agnes Place now stands. This poorhouse stood in a courtyard, having the master's residence in the centre, and some outbuildings on either flank. (Partly shown in sketch, page 525.) The Cage. \u2014 Old inhabitants have had a hand in the rough drawing which I submit for the purpose of illustrating the positions of the cage and workhouse at the beginning of this Workhouse on Plumstead Common, 1748. century. The stocks stood on the western side of the Cage, and the parish well was in the rear. One or two of the laundries in the work house yard are depicted in the drawing. A good old lady who still resides on the spot informs me that the bars of the Cage were wide enough to permit of a jug of tea being passed through to the prisoners. Park Farm. \u2014 In the background of this sketch to the right is a fair-sized house, the same which is now part of the North Kent Brewery. This was the homestead of Park Farm (or Cage Farm), in which was included all the land now covered by the Park Estate, and much beside. The \"Park\" itself was a continuation of the .Slade Valley, its site being now occupied by Chestnut and Park Dale Roads, and, though not extensive, was a charming spot, thickly wooded, and having a stream and miniature cascades, one of which was on the spot now occupied by the Relief Station. At the beginning of the century Mr. Fell was in possession of this farm, and the following extract from the Bow Street police report of February 9th, 1807, speaks of his son's connection with one of the duelling affairs which were then common : \u2014 On Friday night private information was received at the office that Mr. Fell, junr.,"], [201, "525 PLUMSTEAD. of Plumstead, in Kent, and Captain Thomas, of the Marines, had agreed to fight a duel on Saturday morning on Blackheath, in consequence of which Adkins and Miller were despatched with a warrant to apprehend the parties. The officers arrived at the residence of Mr. Fell at an early luur on Saturday morning, before he had risen, when they got an interview with him : they communicated their business, and he did not deny his intention of fighting Captain Thomas. The officers took him into custody and conveyed him in a post-chaise before Mr. Harrington and a number of magistrates, who were sitting at the Barrack Tavern in Woolwich. They took the charge of the officers against Mr. Fell, and admitted him to bail to keep the peace towards Captain Thomas, himself in \u00a3500, and two sureties in \u00a3250 each. The officers then went in pursuit of Captain Thomas, whom they with some difficulty found. He was liberated on giving similar security. Plumstead Cage and part of Workhouse, 1820. In \"Lyson's Supplement \" (1811) it is stated that Plumstead Park Farm is now the property of Andrew Strahan, Esq., M.P., who purchased it of Mr. Bowzer. The Park remained neglected and exposed, but beautiful even in decay, until about 1856. It included all the space between Cage Lane, Liffler Road, and Plumstead Common, and not even tbe buildings which are now spreading over it can quite destroy its picturesqueness. Plumstead Park Estate. \u2014 Mr. Horsley, Mr. Job, and others commenced the work of cutting up the Park about 1865, but the rest of the estate had fallen into the hands of Mr. Lewis Davis, who, prior to 1850, started the Plumstead Waterworks and the North Rent Brewery, now carried on by Messrs. Mitchell and Beazley. Mr. Davis and his family, aided by Mr. Zachariah Parkes, were instrumental in the erection of the Ann Street series of roads.

St. Nicholas Fair, \u2014 One of the last indignities put upon Plum stead Park in its decrepitude was an attempt to revive within it the ancient Fair of St. Nicholas, Plumstead, which had for many years been carrying on a fitful and languishing existence either in the village street or in a small field near the railway station. The attempt, which was made somewhere about 1856, was happily a failure, and the fair has been heard of no more. St. Nicholas Fair has, however, known its better days, and there is an interesting relic of its commercial character in the Westminster School.

The box was purchased by the overseers of Westminster at Plumstead Fair in 1713, when it is pro bable that they came down to inspect the ecclesiastical estates remaining in possession of St. Peter's at Westminster. By some means the box got into possession of the school, and, although the overseers went to law about it, they could not recover the property. The circumstance is chiefly interesting to us as it shows that articles of horn were vended at Plumstead as at Charlton Fair, and probably at most other fairs in the olden time.* Plumstead Market. \u2014 Plumstead Market is not based, like most markets, on charter, statute, or even ancient usage, but has been a natural growth of the last ten or fifteen years. It commenced with a few country carts meeting the retail traders from Woolwich, and has now developed into a busy, crowded, and flourishing market for fruit and vegetables, congesting the old village street in the early morning of nearly every summer day, and on three days a week the whole year round. The Dukes of Suffolk.\u2014 Beyond the church, on the slopes of the hills which have from all recorded time borne the name of \"Bostall \" or \" Borstall,\" is Suffolk Place Farm, which was once the property of the Dukes of Suffolk, and possibly a ducal residence. In the family documents preserved under the designation of \" The Paston Letters,\" there is a mention of Plumstead under the date of 1450, and the Duke of Suffolk is named in the same paragraph :\u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 Wilham, Duke of Suffolk, died 3rd day of May, 28th year of King Henry VI. Jak Cade, the traitor of Kent, fled from Blackhetb, 22nd day of June, 28th year of Henry VI. Injury at Plumbsted near here.t More precise evidence is afforded by a state paper of the reign of Henry VIII., which informs us that Sir Edward Boughton, the King's agent at Plumstead, had a charge against \"my lord of Suffolk\" in 1534, for his share in the cost of repairing the marsh wall ; and next we find that Suffolk Place was sold in 1535 by Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk + to Sir Martin Bowes of Woolwich.

He is described as the most comely personage of his time, and an accom plished courtier and soldier. The fate of his predecessor, Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who was put to death by Henry VIII., to satisfy the posthumous malice of Henry VII., is historical. L L 2"], [206, "528 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. \" Henry Sidney held the fifth part of the lands in Plumstead, once the Duke of Suffolk's.\" It is to be feared that the family acquired the estates by means of Henry VIII.'s spoliations. The name of \" Place,\" which the farm still retains, has a taste of ancient nobility, well sustained by the substantial proportions of the old parlours. Bostall Hea '-..ii, \u2014 Bostall Heath comprises sixty-four acres,* and was purchased in October, 1877, by the Metropolitan Board of Works for \u00a36,000 from the trustees of Queen's College, Oxford, who, as already shown, inherited the manor. Thanks to its preservation as a public space, and to improved means of access, the Heath is now much better known than it was even a tew years back, when, strange to say, its marvellous beauty had scarcely been discovered by the thousands of people who dwelt within the measure of a half-hour's walk. The soli tary grandeur of its once deserted glades may never again be seen, but happily its lovely scenes are now enjoyed by thousands where one would formerly revel in the sole possession of its lavish beauty. It was upon this spot one bright spring morning that the following description was written : \u2014 \u25a0 A little way down Bostall Lane, past some country cottages and well-tilled gardens,t .i pathway opens to the right and takes us to the very sweetest corner of the lovely wilderness. A silent valley lies before us, and a lowly cabin at the portal seems to help the sense of loneliness. We have to step across a tiny rivulet, which, welling out of a neighbouring pool, we may trace hereafter to its source among the mossy hilLs. Only a few paces from the lane behind us, and standing on the soil which is tlie heritage of the London ratepayer, free to everybody and welcome to all the world, me may fancy oneself in a primeval paradise, or in some far sequestered scene where no unhallowed foot may penetrate. It is quite possible that the eye of the common keeper is watching you from amid the yellow gorse on one of those prominences, but you are not aware of any presence other than your own, and can indulge your sylvan dream without a thought of intrusion. As you ascend the valley, taking perchance the rift which forms the watercourse, new charms meet you at every step, and all nature seems rejoicing at the birth of spring. The varied birds, the coloured finches and the sober thrush, sing from the bushes anil from the branches of the slender indigenous birch, and everything that has life, down to the new-born blade of grass, exults in the vigour of youth. Like the poet Bloomfield, whose muse was inspired by this same spot, we climb the \"brown hills\" of Bostall, and mark the tiny sorrel whose modest blush creates the auburn hue which streaks the verdant slopes. At last we reach tlie eminence and survey the whole expanse. The landscape is practi cally without limit. We follow the \" winding Thames \" until it is lost in distance ; wc see beyond the Essex flats the Forests of Epping and Hainhault, and trace the dim outlines of a hundred towns and hamlets. Imagination, too, may put back the hand of time, and fancy picture the diluvian era, when this group of hills around us Eighty acres are shown in the plan of 1720 (page 520, Plate LVIL), evidently including the present enclosure, which is there but faintly marked. t The cottages stood on the west side.

Delightfully Wild. \u2014 A recent writer in the English Illustrated Magazine says \u2014 The Kentish group of commons is redeemed by Bostall Heath from the charge of bareness and monotony, and may boast that it contributes to the circle of London commons one of the prettiest little bits to be found anywhere .... It would be difficult to find a more delightful example of the wild wooded common. The same authority reminds us that at one time, not long before its final preservation, the whole of the Heath was enclosed by Queen's College, but that tbe fence was removed in obedience to the order of the Court of Chancery. Fortunately, says the writer, it is too far from Woolwich, too hilly, and per haps too small, to offer any temptation to drill-sergeants. It has therefore been left in its natural condition, and most charming it is. Situated, like Plumstead, on the top of the sand-hills, its knolls are higher, and most delightful views of the marshes and river may be had from them. On the other hand, the little gorges which pene trate its sides are covered with wild verdure. Young birch wave their delicate leaves and reflect the light from their silvery stems. Purple heather mingles with bright green or yellowing bracken and dark furze ; young oaks give richness of foliage, and sandy scaurs add a touch of orange. On the west the common is flanked by the Scotch firs in the plantation of Sir Julian Goldsniid, while one or two modern villas of bright red bricks with gabled roofs do no harm to the scene. The Name of \" Bostall.\" \u2014 As to the name of Bostall (or Borstall), we are in the same difficulty as we are with the name of Plumstead. I have consulted many authorities, but can only find that the origin of the word is uncertain. Nevertheless it opens a broad range for specu lation. In Anglo-Saxon bos meant an ox or a cow, and borse a calf of six months old. You may hear still in villages of Dorsetshire a spoilt child called a \" bossy-calf.\" In the Lansdowne MS. we have the authority of Kennett for saying that Borstall signifies \"any seat on the side or pitch of a hill,\" but in Sussex the term Bostal is generically applied to \"a winding way up the side of a very steep hill.\"* It is, I think, a fair conjecture to associate the name of the place with the word which describes its character, and my belief is that we may most reasonably trace it to the Norman occupation and the Norman adjective bosquet (Anglais, \"bosky\"), woody, and boscage, a small wood. \" My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down.\" \u2014 The Tempest. \" And in the bosky wood bury his crops.\" \u2014 Peele. We may fancy also that the rugged features of the heath aecord well with the sound of borze \u2014 a natural relative, perhaps, of the \" gorse \" or \" furze \" which flourishes on the hill. * Borstall, near Minster, in the isle of Sheppey, is on just such a hill as this, but il is cultivated."], [208, "530 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. following lines are from the pen of Mr. G. 0. Howell :- The BOSTALL HEATH. All day I've been reclining, Tbe sun above me shining, Away from \" busy haunt of man,\" from artificial town ; Green trees their arms outspreading, Sweet blossoms perfume shedding, Brooks tinkling, beetles humming, and the lark's song pouring down. Midst buttercups and daisies, Where insects chirp their praises, Whem gorse, and heath, and hawthorn white their glories all display For bees to come a-shopping, Their footmen crickets hopping, With blackbird, finch, and throstle singing trios down the way. In dell and ferny hollow, Where streams their courses follow, 'Tween foxgloves (guards of honour !) tail and stately on their banks ; Where \"bunnies\" come a-leaping, While waggish birds are peeping, And dropping bits of feathers on their heads, and other pranks. Where nightingales are greeting, And cuckoos oft repeating The \" old, old story\" to their k>ves we heard so long ago ; Where wood-doves are conversing, Some mournful tale rehearsing, While naughty little brownie-folk are grinning down below. The orchards robed in whiteness, The hyacinths' rare brightness, The swelling bill, the fairy glen, the pine-trees' cool retreat ; The brooklet's ceaseless chatter, The leaflets' merry patter, The gay young toads that leap-frog play down at your very feet.\" Tbe sound of distant cattle, The farm-boy's rustic rattle, The sloping mead, the distant church, and yonder winding Thames ; With sights and sounds so thrilling, My senses have been filling, \u2014 Ah me ! I've been a-feasting in a fairyland of gems ! Loved spot of song and sweetness, So full of rare completeness, 0 happy Paradise on earth that Nature doth bequeath, To charm away our sadness, To till our years with gladness, And make our life worth living, O delightful Bostall Heath ! Bostall Wood.\u2014 Bostall Wood, or the \" Old Park \" as it is some times named, is the property of Sir Julian Goldsmid. It consists of seventy-six acres, and is full of charming spots. The path through it"], [209, "531 PLUMSTEAD. bears the strongest evidences of having been an ancient right of way leading from Abbey Wood to Wickham Lane, but the privilege fell into disuse, and an attempt to re-establish it a few years ago utterly failed. Lodge Lane. \u2014 In Hasted's map of 1778, Bostall Wood is shown extending across the valley to Wickham Lane, and up the valley to Lodge Lane and Wickham Church. The name of this Lodge Lane has long been a puzzle to me. It extends from East Wickham Church to Bostall Heath (past the immense field to which it was proposed some years since to transfer Epsom races), and its name has been conjecturally attributed to Goldie Leigh Lodge, a pleasant house in the grounds east of the Wood ; but I have recently found in the \" Book for the Chvrch - Part of Map of Kent, Sixteenth Century, showing the Plumstead River wardens of Plvmstead, 1701,\" a description of this place as \" Logge's Hill,\" and I see that it is first called \" Loge Hill \" in 1736. Goldie Leigh. \u2014 Goldie Leigh* Lodge just referred to is named after one of the family of Sir John Leigh, who owned much of the land hereabout, and died, as we have seen, in 1737. Dene Holes. \u2014 Perhaps the most curious old-world features of this locality are the great chalk pits previously mentioned. Samples of these pits are found not only in Plumstead, but at Crayford and Bexley. Some antiquarians call them \" Dene Holes.\" A central shaft is sunk from twenty to forty feet, and at the bottom the ground is excavated to form * A gravestone in Plumstead churchyard speaks of Basil John Leigh Goldie, son of Basil Heron Leigh Goldie, of Goldie Leigh and the Ordnance Office. The last named died in 1856."], [210, "532 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. a chamber with a dome-like roof, from which radiate corridors ending in chambers of smaller size. What were they ? Aboriginal dwelling places, refuges, or storehouses ; pitfalls for animals, or merely quarries for chalk ? Nobody can tell. But I hold a belief that they were simply excavated for the chalk required to repair the highways, to which they are always found adjacent. There is one close to the north side of the road ascending Bostall Hill, and one was found a few years ago under the Brookhill Road at Woolwich, near the old thoroughfare between Woolwich and Plumstead Commons. Their bottle shape is probably due to the practice of \" picketing \" under the surface, which miners generally follow to this day. Chalk Galleries and Caves. \u2014 Far more wonderful, though still less known, are the subterranean passages made for the chalk under the brickfields of Wickham Lane. Literally miles of galleries have been worked in the chalk, which has yielded up thousands of tons for conversion into lime and cement. The chalk caves under the edge of Bostall Wood were made for the same object, and the visible depression of the adjacent land is entirely due to chalk workings which ceased about fifty years ago. Chalk wras at one time largely used for road making. Wickham Lane Valley. \u2014 Altogether, there is no spot in the locality so attractive to a thoughtful mind as Wickham Lane. We see the bed of a broad and ancient stream ; the \" combes \" which descend from the common in graceful forms, clad in wild luxuriant growth, remind us of the still remoter ages when the floods carved for us these very hills ; the chalk sections yield us fossils in abundance to mark the gradations of life in the diuturnity of the antediluvian epoch ; and the gravel beds yield abundant remains of tbe great elk and wild oxen who frequented the wooded valley when yet inviolate by the foot of prehistoric man. Approaching more within the limit of our human vision, we find here some tangible and convincing evidences of the Roman occupation which had so vast an influence upon the English people, shedding upon it the light of Christianity and the blessings of civilisation nearly two thousand years ago. Roman Remains. \u2014 It was close to Wickham Lane there was dis covered, in January, 1887, one of the most perfect leaden coffins of Roman manufacture ever found in this country. This discovery has been dealt with at page 11, but it may here be pointed out that the spot where the interment took place was within a hundred yards of Wickham Lane, which may therefore be safely assumed to have been a highway for at least 1,500 years. A Find at Dawson Street. \u2014 Roman coins also are occasionally"], [211, "533 PLUM.STEAD. found in the neighbourhood, as, indeed, they have been found in various parts of Plumstead, proving, if proof were needed, that the soil has served tbe turn of agriculturists for many centuries. When Mr. Wil liam Dawson worked the brickfield upon the spot where Dawson Street now stands, about forty Roman copper coins were met with just under the surface, packed together on edge as if they had been carefully hidden away nearly 1,800 years before. They were all of the Emperor Tra jan's reign and dated about a.d. 98. Age of \"Wickham Lane. \u2014 My conjecture as to the age of Wick ham Lane is based on the conclusion antiquarians form upon the invari able practice which the Romans followed of burying outside their towns and by the roadside, and it is not without good authority I say that the discovery of the before-mentioned coffin and other remains points strongly to the probability of a public cemetery having existed at this spot. The ancient character of the road, however, might have been regarded as established without this evidence, for we may fall back on tbe still better established law that primitive inhabitants everywhere had, and still have : the natural habit of travelling along the sides of rivers and streams. Wickham Lane winds picturesquely through the valley, following the margin of the old river, and, viewed from either end, presents a most effective landscape. Plumstead Common. \u2014 Plumstead Common, which was purchased from Queen's College at the same time as Bostall Heath (1877) for \u00a39,000, consists of ninety-nine acres. The Metropolitan Board paid altogether for the two spaces in Plumstead and the Green at East Wickham, \u00a316,000. The Old Mill. \u2014 The old mill on Plumstead Common, of which Mr. Ranwell has left us such a pleasing picture (page 520), was the scene of a startling occurrence in 1827, the recollection of which is in the minds of old inhabitants. The mill was at that period in full work, and the housewives regularly carried their little store of wheat to the miller, Mr. Longmore (who also kept the Prince of Orange in the village), to be ground into flour. A grand sham fight was arranged for the instruction of the neighbouring garrison, and the battle raged from Bostall Heath to Woolwich. A number of Mr. Long- more's customers, friends, and neighbours swarmed upon the staging round the mill, heedless of warning, until it gave way and injured several of them, the worst sufferer being Mr. Flick, a tailor, of New Road, Woolwich. Mr. Clements afterwards owned the mill, but its presence in modern Plumstead grew anachronistic, its sails and super- structure decayed for want of use, and at last, somewhere about 1848, it was diverted from the making of bread to the selling of beer, and,"], [212, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 534 being eventually granted a full licence, was tacked on to the public house which bears its name. A Famous Plumstead Murder.\u2014 Down towards the Prince of Orange mentioned in connection with the foregoing incident, extended at the same period the farm of Churchwarden Bodie, whose murder made a stir, not only in this locality but throughout the kingdom, in 1833. His homestead is still standing, much as he left it, but it bears the modern name of Montague House, and is now the residence of the tramway manager, Mr. Huddleston. In Bodle's time it was an isolated dwelling, and the home-farm and orchard stretched to the Common over the ground now covered by the Workhouse and Infirmary. Along that self-same road you tread, oh gentle guardian of the poor, when you descend the Workhouse grounds, a young man strode Bodle's Farm, Plumstead. at early morn on Saturday, the 2nd of November, 1833 \u2014 -a young man fair of face and pleasant of tongue, with hideous villainy at his heart. He gave a gay \" good morrow \" to the gardeners and farm servants as they passed to their toil, but his thoughts were thoughts of avarice and murder, and deadly poison was in his pocket. He was about to do a deed which would slay not only one of his nearest relatives and his best benefactor, but perchance destroy a whole household of his friends and kindred, and how many more he knew not ; but no scruples troubled his reflections. So eager was his hand to kill that even the peril of his own life was forgotten, and he pressed on with a fiendish resolution, unmindful of consequences, of caution, and of fear. Often on this very spot, where I heard the tale long ago, have I pictured in imagination the assassin and the scene."], [213, "535 PLUMSTEAD. Fireside stories which we hear as children cling to us through life with the weird fascination of fairy fiction, and, great and manifold as our own experiences may be, hardly any events passing within our knowledge can produce remembrances so deep and lasting as the early impressions imprinted on our tender minds with a stamp too deep to be ever effaced. To this day I cannot look without a shudder at the big square house in Plumstead village where old Mr. Bodie was murdered before I was born, and yet the scenes of other crimes, equally atrocious, which have taken place before our very eyes, have grown familiar, indistinct, and unsuggestive \u2014 perhaps from the indifference grown of frequent contact, but more probably from having fallen upon the hardening susceptibilities of later life. I should want the witching pen of Nathaniel Hawthorne to tell the tale of the village murder at Plum stead as it was photographed upon my sensitive, unsophisticated soul in the years of fancy which preceded a somewhat active par ticipation in the actualities of causes celebres, but the story has some how a special charm which I have alwaj-s had a desire to work out and set down in words. I have never met an old inhabitant without seeking materials for framing a connected and cohesive narrative of the Bodie case, and I never, even now, visit the much-changed spot but I feel that I am treading haunted ground. Bodle's Farm. \u2014 Permit me then to relate the facts as I have found them. George Bodie was a flourishing farmer in the days when farming and ruin were not familiar terms. Those who have handed the legend down testify that Bodie and Budgen were the \" two kings of Plumstead,\" the latter, besides being a banker at Woolwich, holding the Manor Farm and practising agriculture on a large scale in the village, which was then a mile clear of the town. In \"Montague House\" Mr. Bodie lived a long and excellent life, and it was there he died, even at a far-advanced age, the premature death of assassination. The house, now almost shrouded and set fast in an overgrowth of bricks and mortar, had in its loneliness a prim and stately appearance on the outside which betokened peace and order and comfort, within. The gate, at which the old farmer was often to be seen, stood beside the house, exactly where the Workhouse gate is now, and a cart-road wound upwards through the garden, bending to the left as it still does, until it reached a back gate (the present back gate) opening into Riddel's (corrupted into Skittles) Lane.* This lane was overshadowed with fruit-trees, and in the angle where the watercourse flowed over it was a dark pond which was never dry. It was a pretty and a quiet spot in which to have one's home, and just within the back gate of the orchard (the Union stables mark the spot) there was a cosy-looking cottage, the * See note, page .\"556."], [214, "536 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. abode of John Bodie, son of the old churchwarden and father of two sons, George and John. There was another older John Bodie in the family, and to dis tinguish the three John Bodies one from another the villagers named the first \"old- John,\" the second \"middle- John,\" and the third \"young- John.\" The cottage, and the road down which the young man walked on that eventful day \u2014 An hour before tbe worshipp'd sun Peered forth the golden window of the east, were both to be seen, scarcely altered, until the Workhouse was built in 1870. Westward to the vicarage (which is now the Volunteer Inn) the whole frontage was covered by Bodle's bullock-sheds, and beyond the vicarage there were no houses until one reached the corner of Cage Lane and saw the Cage and the stocks in the road and the little Work house round the corner. Eastward, extending beyond Hull Place, was the farmer's kitchen garden (his favourite haunt) elevated on the bank by the roadside, and backed by the granaries and other buildings of a well-to-do yeoman. The household at the farm consisted of Mr. George Bodie, who was eighty-one years of age ; his wife, also advanced in years ; Mrs. Evans, who was daughter of Mrs. Bodie by a former marriage ; Elizabeth Smith, a deaf and dumb girl and Mr. Bodle's granddaughter ; and Sophia Taylor, a servant. One of the men on the farm also slept on the premises, and a cowboy assisted in the housework. On the morning of Saturday, November 2nd, 1833, the whole of these persons were simultaneously seized with similar symptoms of illness, but, suspecting nothing, they did not call for medical assistance until the evening, when Mr. Butler, surgeon, of Woolwich, attended, and was informed of their belief that they had been attacked with cholera. He asked what they had had for breakfast, and was told that they had taken coffee. It had been the practice to give the remains ofthe coffee to a female, named Lear, but, fortunately, she had not used it for her family as usual, and she gave it to Mr. Butler. It was immediately handed to Mr. Marsh, the practical chemist belonging to the Arsenal at Woolwich, who analysed it and found it to contain arsenic. Mr. Bodie died on the following Tuesday. The deceased had resided in Plumstead all his life, and was greatly respected, having held the churchwarden ship continuously for twenty years. His property was estimated at \u00a320,000. On the day after his death, his son, middle-John Bodie, attended before the magistrates, and said he thought his servant, Mary Higgins, could give some information. She was summoned before Dr. Watson and Mr. Stace, the magistrates, and deposed that on one day"], [215, "537 PLUMSTEAD. in the previous week she overheard her mistress in conversation with her son, young-John Bodie. Said the mother : \u2014 \" John, I wish your father was dead.\" \" I wish,\" replied her son, \"that grandfather was dead.\" \" What for ? \" exclaimed the mother. \" Because,\" said John, \"we should then have hundreds or thousands a year.\" This girl added that she had heard young-John tell his mother that he would not mind poisoning anyone he did not like, and he had also said that he wished his father and grandfather would die one day after the other. On the Saturday morning at six o'clock she saw John take his milk-cans and go down towards the farmhouse. He was accustomed to go there for a supply of milk every morning, but she had never before known him to go so early. On this evidence inquiries were naturally made for young--Iohn Bodie, and it was learned that on the Saturday he had left his home and gone to the house of his sister, Mrs. Andrews, who kept a coffee-shop at 82, St. John Street, Clerkenwell. The magistrates soon learnt that the young fellow had purchased arsenic, and placed a warrant for his apprehension in the hands of Constable Morris, who went to the Clerkenwell coffee bouse and there found his man. \" John, I want you,\" said the constable. \u2022' You can't want me,\" replied John ; \" you mean my brother George.*' \" No,\" said Morris, \" it is you I want. I arrest you in the King's name.\" .John instantly fainted, but was soon brought to his senses, handcuffed, taken by the omnibus to Woolwich, and locked up in the Cage. The Inquest. \u2014 The inquest on old Mr. Bodie was held at the Plume of Feathers Tavern by Mr. C. J. Carttar, coroner, and the following jurors, most of them being residents at Woolwich: \u2014 John Ward (foreman), Richard Flick, Charles Milligan, John Bailey, Thomas Mills, Wilham Parsley, Samuel Harwood, John Mitton, William West, Thomas Bickerdike, Wilham Stoneham, John T. Knight, Joseph Lever, Thomas Chiswell, Richard Rixon, Peter Macdonald, and Joseph Peilatt. Mr. William Nokes, solicitor, attended the inquiry on behalf of the parish of Plumstead, and the first witness was \u2014 Mr. John Butler, jun., surgeon, who stated that he was called to the house of Mr. Bodie by a servant on Saturday, and tit once concluded that the whole family were suffering from poisoning by arsenic. He prescribed some remedies, but next morning lie learnt that old Mr. Bodie had taken a pint of ale instead of his medicine, which had aggravated his case and rendered it almost hopeless. He never recovered from the effects of the poison. Sophia Taylor, the servant, gave her evidence in her apartment, being still suffering, and said :\u2014 I got breakfast ready and made the coffee. Mr. Bodie had one cup, and when he and Mrs. Bodie had finished, Mrs. Evans, Elizabeth Smith, and I went into the same room to breakfast. We put more water into the same pot and boiled it again,"], [216, "538 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. and half an hour after breakfast I was very sick. Mr. and Mrs. Bodie were also very ill. The w-ater to make the coffee was taken from a kettle, which it is the duty of the cowboy, Parker, to fill in the morning. He did not do it that morning, because it was done before lie came. The Coroner. \u2014 By whom ? Witness.\u2014 By young-John Bodie. He came into the kitchen between six and seven, which was unusual, and asked if he could do anything for me. I said, \" Nothing that I knew of,\" and he said he would fill the kettle. He never offered to do so before, but I thought he did it from good nature. I then went and fetched him some milk, and he hung the kettle over the tire. He had been in the habit of coming for some milk in the morning this fortnight past. After I gave him the milk he went home. He filled the kettle from the pump in the yard. I filled the coffee-pot from that kettle. I have lived in Plumstead two and a half years, and always on good terms with John Bodie. Cross-examined.\u2014 I am twenty years of age. I never found the prisoner other than a good-natured lad. We have gamboUed together and joked, and once he dressed himself in women's clothes. He is a nice young man, and I have nothing to say against him. For all I know he was on good terms with the family. Mrs. Bodle's married daughter, Mrs. Evans, lives at Bostall, but stayed with us occa sionally. Henry Parker, the cowboy, said he had been in the service of Mr. Bodie for nine years. His first business in the morning was to fill the kitchen kettle, but on Satur day he found young Bodie sitting in the kitchen, and he said, \" Parker, I've done all your work.\" The witness was severely cross-examined concerning a conversation which was supposed to have taken place between him and the prisoner subsequent to the time of which he had spoken, but he declared that the prisoner only said he was sorry that old Mr. Bodie was so bad. Prisoner in Court. \u2014 During this examination the prisoner was brought into the inquest room, and the jury saw before them a tall young man, apparently only twenty years of age, but said to be twenty three. He seemed to be perfectly calm and unembarrassed. Being told that he might ask questions of any of the witnesses he declined to do so. The evidence was then continued : \u2014 Mr. Evans, chemist, of Powis Street, Woolwich, said that the prisoner had twice purchased arsenic of him during the previous week, and said he wanted it to poison rats. Mr. Watts, master of the National School at Plumstead, said that he went with the prisoner on one of the occasions when he purchased arsenic at the shop of Mr. Evans. Mary Higgins, servant at middle-John's cottage, repeated the conversation wliich she had heard between young John and his mother, and said that her master had bidden her tell all she knew. Evidence was also given to show that arsenic was found in the prisoner's box at his father's house. It was also proved that old Mr. Bodie had made his will only a fort night before his death, but the disposition of his property was not stated. Before he died he took an affectionate leave of his son, but forbade young-John to enter the house. Mr. Marsh, the Royal Arsenal chemist, described his test for arsenic, some of which was found in the body, and some in the remains of the coffee, but no traces in the kettle, which had been scrubbed."], [217, "539 TLUMSTEAD. Elizabeth Smith, the deaf and dumb girl, was examined through an interpreter and deposed to seeing the prisoner in the kitchen on the morning of November 2nd. Elizabeth Evans, daughter of Mrs. Boille, was also a witness, and, amongst some others examined were Mrs. Lear, who had the coffee remnants given to her and pro duced them. \" Wilful Murder.\" \u2014 The coroner's jury found a verdict of \" Wil ful Murder \" against young Bodie, and he was committed to Maidstone Gaol on the coroner's warrant. The Trial. \u2014 'The trial took place at the Maidstone Assizes on the 12th of December, 1833, and made a great sensation, public sympathy having been largely invoked in the prisoner's favour by tbe doubts which surrounded the case and the suspicions thrown upon other members of the family. The court was crowded to excess, and upon the bench were many ladies and gentlemen. The prisoner was dressed \"very genteelly in deep mourning.\" The judges were Mr. Justice Gazelee and Mr. Baron Vaughan, and the counsel engaged were Mr. Adolphus and Mr. Vaughan for the Crown, and Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Bodkin for the prisoner. In addition to the witnesses at the inquest \u2014 John Bodie, the prisoner's father, was called and said in his examination : I live at the top of the deceased's garden, and work upon the land. I believe that I am entitled to the bulk of my father's property after the death of my mother. I have not heard that he altered his will shortly before his death. Cross-examined. \u2014 I object to answer whether I was charged with felony, and whether I have three different families, or whether I ever attempted to cut my wife's throat. Samuel Baxter, the prisoner's uncle, deposed : I am one of the executors of the deceased. I have known the prisoner ever since he was born, and I never saw any thing but good of him, or I should not have allowed him to come into my family (witness here shed tears). He was at my house frequently. Henry Mason, of Plumstead, said : I also am executor to the deceased, and have known the lad at the bar from his infancy. I have never known anything against him in my life. He has been respected and beloved generally. The Defence. \u2014 At the conclusion of the evidence, the prisoner was permitted to retire with his counsel and solicitor (Mr. Colquhoun), in order to prepare his defence. On his return he handed in a long statement in writing, which was read aloud by the clerk of the court. Counsel were not at that period allowed to address the jury on behalf of their clients, but it was understood that the written defence had been compiled under the prisoner's instructions by Mr. Colquhoun. It was an able reply, and made a strong impression, but it must be noted that the prisoner, who had when first arrested endeavoured to fasten sus picion upon his brother George, made no scruple in casting the crime upon the neck of his father. In the course of his statement he said \u2014 It is the peculiar, the distinguishing feature of this cruel case, that a variety of circumstances have unhappily combined to place my conduct at the time this event"], [218, "540 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. occurred in a doubtful light. Some were the result of mere accident, but others have been fabricated in pursuance of a deliberate design so to mix up falsehood with truth as to make me the victim of an unjust accusation, and by sacrificing the innocent to shield the guilty. ... My father is the first person to accuse me of this crime. It is he who produces Mary Higgins as a witness to procure my condemnation. What can be the motive which has induced a father thus to conduct himself towards his child ? Gentlemen, I grieve to say my father has not set a fit and worthy example before his family. It has been the lot of his children to see him imprisoned for malicious injury, and guilty of profligacy of all kinds, but still, the voice of nature cannot be dead within him. What is his overwhelming motive 1 Can .any adequate reason be suggested except the desire to avert from himself the terrible consequences of this horrible offence I What a light does not this throw upon the whole mystery ! ... My father had the run of the house, and could do what he pleased with the <-offee-jar. In his anxiety to throw suspicion from himself, he eagerly accuses his own child, misrepresenting facts, swearing to a fabricated conversation with his servant, and exhibiting a line of conduct wicked, unnatural, and irreconcilable except by the dreadful explanation I suggest. Verdict. \u2014 The judge summed up impartially, but was interrupted by the jury, who announced that they had resolved to find the prisoner \u25a0' Not Guilty.\" This caused immense excitement in court, which resounded with demonstrations of satisfaction and applause, and hun dreds of people shed tears. Handkerchiefs waved from the galleries and the prisoner was cheered loudly as he left the place. He was received outside with open arms by the widow of the deceased, and all the jury followed to shake him by the hand. A coach drove up to take him back to Plumstead, where he was received with a hearty ovation from the populace, headed by Mr. Young, a local brewer, who took up his cause with great zeal. The young man attended the parish church on the following Sunday with the family of Churchwarden Cleeve. The vicar, the Rev. H. J. Shaekleton, and his curate, the Rev. Mr. Kimber, entered the pew and shook hands with him, and during the prayers special thanks were offered for his delivery from the peril of death. The Family. \u2014 What became of old Bodle's money? The old villagers never found out, and history sayeth not. But it is pretty certain that very little of it went in the male line direct. The widow lived for some time longer at Plumstead,* and afterwards the Baxters came to reside in a house just beyond the farm, a big house with a queer chimney, at the corner of Riddel's Lane, pulled down some years ago.t \"Middle-John\" and his family remained at the cottage, and George, his son, went on working upon the same land as a labourer for * She was the old man's second wife.

He died there (in the workhouse), in 1886, the last of his race. Young-John's Career. \u2014 But something special was done for the hero John. As soon as Woolwich and Plumstead had finished worship ing him, his relatives, vowing that he should become a good member of society, placed him in business in Bishopsgate Street, but he soon failed, owing to his disreputable way of living. His brother-in-law, in St. John's Street, Clerkenwell, then took him into employ, but he had not been long in his service before he broke open his sister's box, stole \u00a380 therefrom and absconded, and was not heard of by them for eleven years. After he had disappeared for seven of these years, during which he was probably in gaol for other offences, his mother died, and it was currently reported that on her death-bed she made some impor tant revelation concerning the murder, but the nature of the statement was not published. It was generally understood, however, that she exonerated her husband from the guilt, and threw it upon her errant and unnatural son, and she probably explained her own part in the matter, which was not quite free from suspicion. Four years later, (October, 1843), her husband died at Gravesend, and his last words were \u2014 \" I have been a profligate I know, but I leave the world unstained by crime ; ,; a declaration which satisfied those who already believed in his innocence, and nobody else. Confession. \u2014 Now comes the solution to all the mystery in a report which was printed by a London newspaper in February, 1844 \u2014 four months after \" Middle-John \" had died \u2014 and it ran as follows : \u2014 During the past week much interest has been manifested in the vicinities of Plumstead, Charlton and Woolwich, in consequence of a report that John Bodie, who was tried and acquitted eleven years ago for the murder of his grandfather, had confessed to being the individual who perpetrated the atrocious deed, which, from inquiries that have been instituted, turns out to be too well founded. On Tuesday afternoon last, John Bodie, who assumed the name of John Bardon Smith, was convicted at the Central Criminal Court before Mr. Justice Coleridge, for extorting money bv means of threats of a most abominable description from Mr. Robinson, the butler of Lord Abingdon, some particulars of which appeared in our Marlborough Street police reports a few weeks since. There were two indictments laid against him ; the court, however, only went into one, of which he was found guilty ; but it is only right to say that if the second had been investigated it would have further showed the systematic course of villany wdiich he has tor a length of time carried on ; and the learned judge in passing a sentence of twenty years' transportation upon him, strong^' commented upon the diabolical manner in which he had chosen to stigmatise his innocent victim. He had admitted his guilt in a letter which he had written in Newgate to Mr. Robinson, the prosecutor, praying that he would forego the prosecu tion, as his conviction would cause the death of an only sister and prevent his union M M"], [220, "542 RECORDS OE THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. with a respectable young lady of some property ; and in conclusion that the charge he had made against him he had completely trumped up in the hope of extorting some money. Since the prisoner's incarceration in New-gate, it has been communicated to the friends of the unfortunate deceased gentleman Mr. John Bodie, that of the crime of murder of wdiich he was accused and at his trial acquitted, he was the guilty party, and no one else but himself was engaged in the horrible transaction. The prisoner is in his 33rd year, about five feet six inches in height, and of slender stature, and his manners are somewhat pleasing. According to the law of England, the prisoner could not be a second time tried for the murder, but he was transported beyond the seas, and happily was never again heard of; and so ends the story of the famous Plumstead murder."], [221, ""], [222, "[To facp page 543 ] View from site of Central Schools, 1849.

West Plumstead. \u2014 The portion of Plumstead in which its inhabitants have probably most concern is that portion which adjoins Woolwich, and is known as \" West Plumstead,\" or \" Burrage Town.\" This also has its special history, beginning at a period long remote, but capable by diligent research of clear delineation. \"Burrage Town,\" which would be more correctly written \" Burghesh Town,\" takes us as far back as the early days of Edward III. and the Black Prince. In the year 1330, a Norman nobleman known as Lord Bartholomew de Burghesh,* had his seat at Plumstead. He died in 1355, and left his mansion and estate to his son, who, by virtue of that remarkable freedom with which people changed their names in the early days, called himself Bartholomew, Lord Burwash. The next heir did not retain the property, but in 1370 sold it to Sir Walter de Pavely, Knight of the Garter, in whose family it continued until some period in the reign of Richard II. (1377-99), when it was sold to William Chichley, f an alderman of the City of London. John Chichley, son of the alder man, inherited the estate, and is said to have passed it to his daughter Agnes, who bestowed it, together with her hand,:}: upon Mr. Tattersall, of Well Hall, Eltham, by whom, at the beginning of Henry VI.'s reign, it was conveyed to the Boughton family. The Boughtons. \u2014 In this family, which has many historical associations with Woolwich and Plumstead, the estate remained until the time of Phillipots, the historian, who relates its transfer to Rowland Wilson, of London, by whom it was bequeathed to his daughter. * Lord Bartholomew de Burghesh of Plumstead was the son of Robert de Burghesh, Warden of the Cinque Ports, who died in 1306. His son, Sir Bartholomew (afterwards Lord) de Burghesh, who died in 1369, had part of the Manor of Charlton. The family pedigree goes to show that the poet Chaucer, who was a knight of Kent, and Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk (1470), were among his descendants. The connection of the House of Suffolk with Suffolk Place, Bostall, is referred to at p ige 527. The Earl of Westmorland is Baron Burghersh, and comes of a Kentish tamily. The eldest son has the title by courtesy of Lord Burghesh. t Query, Chichele : see page 20.

The Maxeys and Pattisons.\u2014 In 1702 Nathaniel Maxey, merchant, of London, bought the house and estate, consisting of three hundred acres, known as \"Burwash, Burrough Ashe, or Borage,\" and about the same time, Mr. James Pattison married Miss Mary Maxey, and ultimately obtained for himself and posterity the now valuable Burrage Estate. Mr. James Pattison died on the 22nd of March, 1761, aged eighty-five years ; and there is an entry in the vestry register of March, 1770, of the burial of \" Mrs. Mary Pattison from Burwash.\" James was succeeded by his son Nathaniel Pattison, who died 22nd of April, 1784, aged seventy. The next possessor was Nathaniel Maxey Pattison, of Congleton, Cheshire, whose only son was James Pattison, merchant and M.P. for the City of London, who died in 1849, aged sixty-three, leaving the estate under his will as a family settlement. He was followed by his eldest son, Mr. Frederick Pattison, a distinguished Freemason,* who died without issue on the 10th of May, 1877, when the property became vested in his brother and sister, Major Charles and Miss Helen Pattison, the latter of whom, having survived her brothers, is now sole possessor.

Tradition and the oldest authorities concur on this point, and I venture even further with an assumption that the church itself, or some monastic building eonnected with it, spread at one time over this spot. Extensive vaults, which now do duty as cellars, support Mr. Russell's house, and contain carved arches and doorways of stone which could never have been designed for mere cellars. This is mere surmise, but the fact of the vicarage having once stood here is fully established by the early maps. Our plan of 1720 shows the vicarage by the side of the road, where it remained until the Rev. Mr. Acworth's time, when the centre ofthe parish was moved to St. Margaret's and the old parsonage turned into the Volunteer Tavern ; the maps which place the parsonage next the church are of much older date. Shrewsbury House. \u2014 Shrewsbury House will be found treated of when we reach Shooters' Hill, but it may be here mentioned that the Herbert Estate, or Shooters' Hill Estate, was laid out by the British Land Company about 1861. Nearly the whole area was previously occupied by the pottery and farm of Mr. Gates, access to which was by a bridle lane opposite the Fox and Hounds and by the road called West Lane at the bottom of Fox Hill. There was a very pleasant walk from the Fo.r across the fields, in which a windmill stood near the site of the Eglinton Road Board Schools, and a romantic little valley had to be crossed where we now cross Whitworth Road. Herbert Estate. \u2014 The first road made here was Herbert Road, the name of which was, I believe, derived from the good Lord Herbert of Lea, Secretary at War ; and, following suit, the owners of the land took most of their other street names from the Peerage \u2014 Llanover, Paget, Whitworth, Ripon, Eglinton, &c. Respecting Cantwell Road I have only to say that in 1817 there was a Cantwell on the Plumstead ratebook as an owner of land. In August, 1861, referring to the then recent census, the Kentish Independent remarked : \u2014 The rapid growth of what may be termed the \"town\" of Plumstead, is scarcely paralleled by any other result of the late census. New streets and roads have sprunZ up suddenly in all directions, and the houses are all tenanted. The Estate of the British Land Company, which comprises a large tract in the neighbourhood of Gate's pottery on the way to Shrewsbury Lane, is likewise to be devoted to building pur poses, and a road is being made which leads directlv from the Fox and Hounds at Sandy Hill to the Royal Military Academy on Woolwich Common, a thoroughfare which will undoubtedly be one of considerable importance."], [231, "549 PLUMSTEAD. Twenty-three years later the same paper spoke of \" the last step \" in making Herbert Road of its full width throughout by the removal of a projection near the north end, as An occasion of sad memories of pleasant walks along the old lane which led from the top of Sandy Hill to the Royal Military Academy, of the gates and stiles at either end, of the blackberry bushes across the fields, and the dip down in the midway valley, of the old windmill on the hill, the wild rose hedges, the nightingales in the West Lane woods, and the purling stream, now buried under the Lord Clyde Tavern. The Painter of \" The Foundling.\"\u2014 At the angle of the Herbert Estate where it touches the Woolwich boundary at Nightingale Vale was the only cart road which invaded the region prior to the formation of Herbert Road. This was the now familiar West Lane, but it was a thoroughfare no farther than the farm buildings which occupied the site of the Lord Herbert Tavern and adjacent houses, and had no dwellings beside it other than a picturesque cottage among fruit trees at the lower corner. Perched upon the high bank now occupied by Edgehill Road there were a few smaller cottages, and the eastern side of West Lane was an expanse of strawberry gardens. On the western hill we may still see the remains of a rugged wood. This in 1850 was included in the grounds of Mrs. Tanswell, an elderly lady who lived in the house which is now No. 5, Nightingale Vale, and the wood was known as \" Tanswell's Roughs.\" It was provided with pleasant paths and spread from the brook in the valley all the way up West Lane, enclosed within a hedge of wild roses. In the house of Mrs. Tans well Mr. G. B. O'Neill,* the artist, painted his picture of \"The Foundling,\" which was exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1852. I present an engraved copy taken (by permission) from the Art Journal, and I give it place not only because it is an admirable work,t but because the characters represented are all portraits * Mr. G. B. O'Neill was one of three brothers who lived for many years in the Nightingale Valley, and they had a sister with them. Their father was storekeeper in the Royal Carriage Department, and they were conspicuous in such pious works as Holy Trinity Sunday School and the Ragged School, which was held in the upper room of the Woolwich soup kitchen. t The subject represents a village vestry meeting and is founded on the following lines from Crabbe's \" Parish Register\" : \u2014 \" To name an infant met our village sires, Assembled all as such event requires.

The features of the benevolent-looking old nurse are those of Mrs. Tanswell, and the artist, who was apt at choosing his models, has surrounded her and the infant with a lifelike group. The chairman is in the likeness of Mr. J. M. Boddy, bookseller and stationer,* who lived at 68, Wellington Street, Woolwich ; of the two behind him, the one with his back turned, who looks like the village doctor, was drawn from Mr. Niven, formerly a sergeant-major of artillery, and afterwards beadle of St. John's, while the other (who faces us) is believed to have been sketched from the life presentment of \" Daddy \" Eves, a resident at Plumstead Common. He who is so positive in laying down the law to the chairman has the face of Mr. Edwin Crowther, a learned barber who dwelt at No. 56, Artillery Place ; the vestryman who studies the infant through his glasses was Mr. .John Frederick Wolff, a clerk in the Engineer Office, who resided at 84, Wellington Street, and at his back stands Mr. Samuel Watts, of Henry Street, the Woolwich beadle, bellman and crier. In the foreground sits the parish clerk, an interesting figure in wig and gaiters, with the features of Mr. Handcorn, a retired Ordnance Storekeeper.

Brambleberry House. \u2014 \" Bramblebriars \" is one of the best remaining houses of last-century Plumstead. It stands in Vicarage Road, formerly Deadman's*!: Lane, or Brambleberry Lane, and is the Vicarage of St. Margaret's parish. The mansion, which is now known as \" Braniblei'ov/ House,\" is of long standing. A cypress-tree in the ground is said to be one hundred and fifty years old, and to have been planted by a relation of Captain Thomas Dickinson, R.N., who resided here in 1811. Captain Dickinson was Superintendent of Ordnance Shipping, and after his death his widow, who was known as i.ady Dickinson, lived there for a number of years. The house is supposed to have been the residence of officers connected with the Navy since the Navy was first established.

Plumstead Ague. \u2014 The removal of Vicar Acworth from the Vicarage on the marsh level to the Vicarage on the uplands was, un- Bramblebriars about 1820. questionably, a judicious proceeding. The marshes, although so long reclaimed from the river, were yet wanting proper drainage, and still remained, for the most part, a swamp and a source of malaria and ill health to the neighbourhood. Hughson, writing in 1808, describes Plumstead, with only partial truth, as \" an unwholesome marshy parish adjoining Woolwich,\" and most of the older guide books when they speak of Plumstead speak also of \" the Plumstead Ague.\" Between 1830 and 1850 attempts were made to deal with the evil, but agues and fevers continued to be characteristic of Plumstead, and even of * Park : an enclosure fur deer or public amusements. \u2014 Webster."], [236, "552 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Woolwich, until 1854-5, when a select committee was appointed by the Government to investigate the subject. The cause was traced directly to the bad drainage of the marshes, and the committee recommended a more perfect system to be carried out by the Commissioners of Sewers at the cost of the landowners, who would, they declared, be fully recouped by the improved value of the soil. These works were executed, and, in combination with the great main sewer which now bisects the marsh, has made the land some of the most fruitful in the district, got rid of the ague, and converted the parish into one of the healthiest in the metropolitan area. The \"Plumstead Ague,\" which was once a proverb, has almost ceased to be a memory. The Marshes in '44.\u2014 The following description of Plumstead marshes prior to these improvements was written by Mr. Ruegg in Canal proposed to be made from Erith to Woolwich through Plumstead Marshes. Survey and Plan made by Joseph Steeren, Tower Royal, Sept. 1812. 1847, showing that something had been attempted and accomplished even then \u2014 Within my recollection, morasses, the abode of snipe and lapwing, and pools which were the breeding places of the teal and mallard, have been reclaimed from the dominion of solitude, and are now yielding the first-fruits of an abundant harvest .... In 1844 I strolled down one of the manor-ways and never shall I forget the scene. At the side lay a field which, for the first time, perhaps, was under the do- minion of the plough. The autumn rains had made its surface a succession of pools and bogs, and the field swarmed with a countless multitude of birds-a few lapwings were m one corner, while starlings, field-fares, redwings, blackbirds, thrushes larks sparrows, and other birds made the ground absolutely dark with their numbers the winged multitude rising and falling at each alarm in undulating masses. Not' less numerous were the snipes who thronged every pool and swamp, and while I stood, a flock of a hundred more alighted on the surface. Till January they abounded in the marshes, and a few days afterwards, when shooting there, myself and a friend fired at least a dozen times over a small swamp before we roused the whole of the birds it contained. The swamp was not more than about fifty yards in length, so that our shot must have gone over the heads of the birds as they were feeding. . . The"], [237, "553 PLUMSTEAD. pheasant is scarce, as there is no cover in the marshes ; partriilges are tolerably abun dant. The pigeons which breed in the neighbouring woods come down somewhat numerously and drink at the pools and dykes. We have no grouse, though the moorlike uplands present a fine breeding ground. It was the intention of the late Lord Saye and Sele, whose mansion at Belvidere is a prominent feature in the scenery, to have turned out some black grouse in his grounds, but the idea was never carried into effect. Rapacious birds, principally of the smaller kind, abound. We are sel- dom without the kite ; the kestrel and sparrow-hawk are plentiful. The beautiful little martin is sometimes seen, and once or twice in Spring I have observed the com- mon shrike, or butcher-bird, and the red-backed shrike. The two common British species of owl are numerous, and the marshes are seldom without a pair of ravens.

But, turning: to the eastward at Plumstead Common Road, we saw one or two houses on either side, and on the left hand was nearly all hedgerow until you reached a farmhouse with a pond in front (on the site of the Central Schools) occupied by Mr. Jen ner, who farmed much of the land upon which the Burrage Estate now stands. The lower end of Burrage Road was still a country lane, and at the top was a footpath across fields to Plumstead Common.

Save for a few scattered cottages occupied by farm labourers, there were no dwellings until we reached Plumstead Common, and the triangle which lies between Park Road and Park Street was a green knoll much frequented by children, \" school treats,\" and merry-making parties from Woolwich. Park Road was the highway, but the Richmond Place footpath, after passing the back of the AVater-works, continued by way of Park Street to the Common. At the lower end of Vicarage Road (Deadman's Lane) was a mud hut, and from this point to the village there were only two or three houses on the right hand. The Borer Castle and Cole Fields on the left were followed by a plantation of trees stretching Plan illustrating the First Growth of Plumstead, 1855. as far as the Manorway, with an ordinary five- barred gate leading to the inner marsh. Virtually the whole of Plumstead has been built since 1840. Much the same as Plumstead had been for centuries it remained until the coming ofthe passing generation. Most of the older streets and roads in Plumstead have historical associations. Plumstead Street Names. \u2014 As we have done in Woolwich, we may read something of history in their titles. Burrage Road and Burrage Grove take their names, as we have seen, from the house, park, and estate founded by Lord Burghesh about 1330. Nothing remains to us of his nobility beyond a corrupted title, but that, with variations, has endured for"], [239, "555 PLUMSTEAD. more than five hundred years. 'Burrage Road was laid out about 1849. The areas of the houses on the eastern side at the upper part show the extent to which it was necessary to raise the road. Pattison Road and many more are associated byname with the family which lias owned the Burrage estate since its acquisition by their ancestor, Nathaniel Maxey, in 1702. Maxey Road thus explains itself, for it is the family name of the Pattisons on the female side. Congleton Terrace and the Oongleton Arms in Maxey Boad are derived from the Cheshire town whence the Maxeys came. Swetenham Place is named after an old Cheshire family connected with the Pattisons. Comberbach Terrace takes the name of another Cheshire family. Sandbach Place (pronounced Sandbatch) is called after a Cheshire town. Chester Place, of course, has the like origin. Parry Place immortalizes Col. Parry, who married into the Pattison family. Frederick Place is named after Frederick Pattison, who was in our time, besides being owner of the estate, Grand Warden of English Freemasons under the Prince of AVales. Zetland Arillas and Yarborough Villas, which were early names in Burrage Road, were so called in honour of distinguished Freemasons. St. James's Church and St. James's Place commemorate Mr. James Pattison, M.P., who died in 1849, just before the estate developed. Charles Street and Arthur Street are called after other of the Pattisons. Willenhall Road is named after the country seat of Major Charles Pattison, near Coventry. Hudson Road was so called from the name of the late senior solicitor and also the surveyor of the estate. Coupland Terrace bears the name of the present well-known solicitor and agent of the Burrage estate. Oliver Street owes its derivation to that great poetic genius, Oliver Goldsmith. with whom the Hudsons are related. Dawson Street stands on the site of Dawson's brickfield, and the hill at the eastern end marks where the houses were run up a clay bank and pug-mill, in the burr}- of building, without a thought of levels. Vicarage Road is an old thoroughfare, and was, in 1850, called Deadman's Lane.t Its name of Brambleberry Lane was taken from \" Bramblebriars,\" which is now the Aricarage.J Richmond Place in its diagonal course is the relic of an ancient footpath leading from the Manorway through the AA'arren to Plumstead Common at the Old Mill. It ran behind the AAraterworks, but was diverted up Park Boad about 1860.\u00a7 The name was given to it from a family association of the Pattisons. It will be observed that at the top of Richmond Hill appropriately stands the Star and Garter. Bramblebury Road, formed about 1882, is a survival of the old name of the Alcarage. It should have been Bramble&ern/. Burwash Boad (1884) revives an old name ofthe Burrage estate. Baglan Boad grew out of the small beginnings of Somerset Terrace, adopted by family association, when the houses were built, about the time of the Crimean War, 1854-5, while Lord Baglan commanded the British forces. Anglesea Boad was cut through Campion's garden about the same date, and took its name from the tavern, and the tavern was christened after the famous Marquis. || Ann Street, Bose Street, Robert Street, and Thomas Street were named by Mr. Lewis Davis after his children. * The estate has at various times been described as Burghest, Burghesh, Burwash, Borough-ash, Borage, Burrish, Burridge, and Burrage. t See note, page 550.

Conduit Road has a natural source, for the spring or conduit from which, until about 1858, water was drawn and hawked about Woolwich, was near the junction with Crescent Road. Crescent Road necessarily is named after its graceful form, which was a consequence ofthe sandpits on the western side. Mars Terrace in Crescent Road was the property of Mr. Sales, the lighterman. He had a barge named \" The Mars,\" and built Mara House, Wood Street, Woolwich. Crisp Terrace, recently added to the Burrage Estate, is named after Dr. Crisp, who owned the estate in 1702. Badgemore Terrace, adjacent, for some time a puzzle, was the name of a residence which Major Pattison had on the banks of the upper Thames. Lee Street was laid out by Mr. T. Lee, a retired Woolwich publican, who built and lived at Oaklands. Bloomfield Road was named after the tavern at the top, which was so caUed in honour of the distinguished commandant who ruled at Woolwich in 1838. Cambridge Place had a similar foundation, being in honour of the Royal Duke. Armstrong Street, Whitworth Place, &c, were named after the rival gunmakers during the war with Russia. Eton Road was so named by Mr. Tongue on completing a successful contract at the school town. Griffin Road was borrowed from the adjacent and ancient Griffin Manorway. I cannot say who was Griffin. Orchard Road and Orchard Place (the latter obsolete) mark tbe positions of the plum and cherry orchards to the south of the high road. Cage Lane takes its name from the old Cage which stood at the lower end. It was formerly known as \" Water Lane,\" from the stream which crossed the high road at its foot.* The Slade means the \" slade \" or slide or slip of the ground, and aptly describee the picturesque ravine. Timbercroft Lane,t Swingate Lane, and Plum Lane are all relics of agricultural days. Swingate Lane is shown as a well-defined road from Plumstead Common to \"Wickham Street,\" in the plan of 1720.J The road from Timbercroft Lane I believe to have formerly extended to Wickham Lane and thence to Abbey Wood. Skittles Lane\u00a7 was, in 1849, known as \"Riddel's Lane,\" from Mr. Kiddel, who owned a small farm upon it. Strand Place in the village is a vestige of the ancient river \" strand \" or beach before the marsh-lands were reclaimed. Speranza Street, adjoining, may serve as an example of many other new streets The owner, in his heart's emotion, wished to call it \" Hope Street,\" but the Metro politan Board, just for a change, turned it into Italian. Wrottesley Road was laid out by Mr. William Farnfield about 1877 at which time Colonel Wrottesley was Commanding Royal Engineer at Woolwich \u25a0 but this was one of the last of the street-names selected for their appropriateness. Most of the newer streets and roads in the parish have been named at hazard or caprice by the prosaic clerk at the Metropolitan Board and have no historical connection. * See page 521. + See page 522. t See na^es 521 9 \u00a7 By request of the residents who did not relish the name of \" Skittles,\" the old lane was renamed Riverdale Road,\" m March, 1889.

Here and there amid the ancient documents we meet it again and again, bowed down with sorrow and oppressed with care.

Simony in the Stuart Days. \u2014 The church living was the subject of a law suit in the days of Charles I., and the Rev. Mr. Clapham seems to have secured it to himself by a rather shady proceeding. * On Feb. 21, 1664, Christopher Pett, master shipwright at Woolwich, rep.jrted that \" Isaac Sanderson, minister of Plumstead, has sent in a sample of broom which is large and fit for service.\" t Dr. Benjamin Barnett was prebendary of Gloucester, died 1707. % He gave the communion plate. \u00a7 At a meeting held on Monday, June 7, 1841, at the Plume of Feathers, Plum stead, for the settlement of the tithe question between the Rev. J. Shackleton and the tithepayers, it was resolved \" to exceed (accede) to the proposal made by Mr. Colqu houn and on the part of the vicar, for an increase of 20 per cent, upon the sum now paid.\" N N"], [244, "558 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The only facts we can gather concerning it are contained in a letter to the unfortunate Archbishop Laud by the Lord Chief Justice. The Archbishop had desired to know what the Lord Chief Justice thought of the trial which had taken place \" against the king's clerk, Mr. Bough ton, by Mr. Clapham, for the vicarage of Plumstead in Rent, at the Common Pleas bar.\" The Chief Justice replied that tbe case had had a fair hearing, but that he was in no way satisfied with the verdict. He states the case thus : \u2014 Clapham, finding the incumbent to be dangerously sick, obtained a grant of the next presentation for \u00a3150, with articles that if within the year the grantee disliked his bargain, he should have his money again with interest at 8 per cent. Within the year the church became void, and then he liked bis bargain. If the incumbent had lived, it is more than probable he would have disliked. This playing at fast and loose is a witty way of liuying a presentation, and it is feared that if this prosper, others will follow this track, but the business is concluded, and our law cannot now help it. Another Delinquent. \u2014 On the 4th of June, 1647, (when Charles I. was a prisoner), the inhabitants of Renilworth petitioned against the induction of the Rev. William Morice into the vicarage of that parish, alleging that \u2014 William Morice was formerly sequestered and removed lor delinquency from the livings of Wickham and Plumstead in Kent, by the Committee for Plundered Ministers, and thereby rendered incapable of holding any other living ; but the Earl of Monmouth, not knowing of this, presented him to the living of Kenilworth. He was again sequestered for contempt and disobedience to their orders by the same committee, and when brought before them, was ordered to be kept in custody till he should give good security for giving up possession of the vicarage. Articles were at the same time exhibited to the Committee for Plundered Ministers against William Morice, declaring that \u2014 He is a swearer and drunkard ; has drunk Prince Rupert's health in an ale-house with malignants on a fast day, and kissed the mistress of the house ; has neglected to read the ordinances ot* Parliament, &c. On the same paper is a copy of an order of the Committee for Plundered Ministers of the 11th of May, 1647, sequestering Morice from the living of Renilworth. The rev. gentleman appears to have been not only turned out of Renilworth, but, being accused of calling various orthodox ministers \" factious fellows,\" \" fools,\" &c. ; of using wicked words, and of threatening to keep possession of the vicarage in spite of any orders to tbe contrary, he seems also to have been put under bail for his good behaviour. More Stir.\u2014 Tbis Morice bad evidently stirred up some trouble all round, for there are several state papers on the subject of Plumstead Church about the same date. Thus, on September 25th, 1645, there was a petition of Mathias Milward, Bachelor in Divinity. He had"], [245, "559 PLUMSTEAD. been presented to the vicarage of Plumstead, Rent, and prayed for an order from the House of Lords for his institution and induction, as the Bishop of Rochester was absent, and there was no Chancellor of the diocese. And only a short time after, March 2nd, 1647, there appears an application for an order for Dr. Heath to institute and induct, not Mathias Milward, but Isaac Sanderson, to the vicarage of Plumstead, Rent. I cannot find that Mr. Milward was actually inducted, but as he had charge for a time I include him in the Hst of rectors. Most of these early records are vague and obscure : some give us but inferential information, and some provokingly fall short at the most interesting point, such as the letter which Secretary Cecil wrote in 1600, from the court of Queen Elizabeth to the Bishop of Rochester, saying \u2014 The son of Auditor Curl has petitioned you, as the lawful patron, for institution to Plumsted vicarage, co : Kent, for a man of learning and good parts; I request his admission. The Church Three Hundred Years Ago. \u2014 This is all we hear about that matter, and there is altogether a dearth of information concerning the church and its rectors in the olden days. We are carried, however, a little farther backward by the inventory taken for Henry VIII., after the Dissolution (in 1552), which informs us that Plumstead Church had at that time \"three bells, also one bible, with Paraphrasis of Erasmus, and a silver chalice weying ix ounc's.\" Civil Marriages. \u2014 During the suspension of the Established Church, under the Commonwealth, we find the following entry in the Plumstead vestry book : \u2014 James Stanley and Anne End, both of this parish, had their marriages solemnized by John Twistleton, Esquire, Justice of Peace at Dartford, upon November 4th, 1654. Gossages. \u2014 The old church has been repeatedly patched up and restored, and it bears on its body the traces of many operations of various kinds. It seems to have suffered in the Civil War. Inside the church is preserved a black marble tablet which says : \u2014 Here lyeth the body of Mr. John Gossage, who by his care and greate indvstry cavsed this chvrch to be repaired after above twenty years lying waste and rvinous.

History has not left us much information concerning these good people. In the Index Villarus, published in 1690, it is recorded that the number of gentlemen resident in Plumstead was two only. One of these we may suppose to have been the vicar, and the other we may assign to Burwash Court (or Burrage House), which was then in the occupation of a descendant of Dr. Crisp. The Gossages were probably well-to-do farmers.* Lidgbird, Cook and Pattison. \u2014 I must quote two other pairs of churchwardens from the period at present under notice. In 1727 John Lidgbird and John Cook were churchwardens of Plumstead, and in 1739 there were in conjunction John Lidgbird and James Pattison. Of the Pattisons much has been already said. This Mr. James Patti son was the founder of the Pattison (or Burrage) Estate. Mr. Lidgbird, high sheriff of Rent in 1741, resided at Shrewsbury House, Shooters' Hill, and died in 1771. lie has a handsome monument in the church, and his descendants are still amongst us.f There is reason to suppose that the John Cook here mentioned was an ancestor of the Cooks of Bostall, one of whom was the last parish constable of Plum stead, and died in 1881. Free School. \u2014 The free school house in the vii- lage was built by Mr. Henry Lidg bird in 1797 ; and in 1808, Mr. Wil liam Cole of Dul wich endowed this same school with Plumsteael Free School. \u00a31,000. It is now a mineral water manufactory and the bequests are diverted to other schools. The Church in Ruins Again, \u2014 The church did not always find * Helen Greenwell, wife of the first-named Gossage, was daughter of a London Morehsuit. t See \" Shooters' Hill.\""], [247, "561 PLUMSTEAD. such friends as the Gossages, for about the end of the last century it was again in a ruinous state, as may be seen by the accompanying illustration from an old print, and by plate LXL, page 557, which is copied from an original drawing, date about 1780. Brayley, writing in 1808, says : \u2014 Plumstead Church is an old structure, partly dilapidated, and now consisting of one piece only, with a neat tower of brick at the north-west angle. These illustrations show that the north wall was left an isolated wreck, and the parishioners must surely have felt scandalized at seeing trees spring up in the ruins of their venerable church. It was n ot until Plumstead Church with tree in the ruins. Drawn and engraved about 1800. 1820, as we have seen, that the north nave was rebuilt, while the ancient floor, which had long been buried, was not laid bare until about 1870. Ancient Dimensions. \u2014 The whole edifice as it stands is probably not more than one-third of the dimensions of the original structure. Traces remain which indicate that there was once a south nave as well as a north nave, and the projecting vestry was apparently a part of it. The spring of the arches in the south wall which correspond with those on the north side are clearly visible, but the style of workmanship and appearance of the walls and windows show that the operations of removal and repair must have taken place several centuries back. At"], [248, "562 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the chancel end alone the building has lost more than it has retained altogether. Where the ground falls abruptly in the churchyard, twenty-five paces eastward of the present external wall, the sexton in digging graves finds a solid foundation of brickwork, which proves to demonstration that the church extended to that spot, notwithstanding that the east wall, as we now see it, might be regarded as equal in age with the oldest portion of the structure. Scarcely any part of the church, however, can be examined without conviction that the materials have been used for rebuilding, perhaps repeatedly. Even the west wall, where the tower stands, has not an exterior mien, and, as the tower is not more than a few hundred years old,* we may conjecture that a clergy house, or some other erection, continued the building westward, probably covering the crypt which we have seen at Mr. Russell's \" manor-house. \"f The most ancient parts of the church are to be traced in the walls on the south, west, and part of the east sides. They are believed to be Norman on ac count of their mas siveness, the Nor mans having built solidly for strength and without but tresses. The present buttresses are of much later date. Three lancet win dows may be seen in Plumstead Church after its Restoration, 1870. the south wall, one glazed and two bricked up. These also are of Norman type and give to the church an apparent antiquity of 800 or 900 years. The Rev. J. K. Walpole, who was curate in 1860, wrote a pamphlet + in which he said : \u2014 Like all ancient churches, ours is divided by pointed arches, springing from octagonal columns into the nave in the middle and north and south aisles. The pavement seems to have suffered much from the ruin of the church, as various grave stones may be seen laid down anyhow, or only in fragments. One of Purbeck stone, which is unbroken, is remarkable ; it has an inscription round the edges, in characters which were in use in England before the Norman Conquest, some of which, from its position in the doorway of the vestry, have got trodden out. An antiquarian has presumed it to be some eight or nine hundred years old. Beneath the pews there * The roof and the tower were a portion of the restorations effected by Mr. John Gossage in the reign of Charies II. + See pages 547-8. X Historical Sketch of Plumstead, by the Rev. J. K. Walpole : 1860, ls."], [249, "563 PLUMSTEAD. may be other curious relics of bygone ages. There are no sepulchral brasses in the pavement, but the trace of one may be seen in a slab just outside the vestry door. The outline shows it to have been of a woman, and the brass nails and lead which fixed it to the stone are still remaining. This stone is not entire, nor, of course, in its original place, but seems to have been laid there as a threshold when the old stones were being worked up for all sorts of purposes. That stone, now being continually walked over and being gradually worn away, once lay over the very spot of the burial of some dear one now utterly forgotten and unknown. The panelled work which now terminates the eastern end is probably a portion of the Gossage restoration, as it appears to be of seventeenth century handicraft. The painting in the centre represents the Virgin and Child, and was presented in 1821 by Mr. G. T. Gainsborough to complete the restorations. Mr. Walpole discovered under the spring of the south-easternmost arch an ancient pointed stone shield, the armorial bearings of which are almost obliterated by coats of white wash. There was a gallery at the west end, with an organ (now on the chancel floor). In front was a clock, above which the children of the old village schools sang the hymns. The organ was removed and the gallery abolished during the ministry of the Rev. W. Acworth. Masons' Marks. \u2014 We are invited by Mr. Walpole to look up at the sturdy oak tie-beams which cross the interior. In these he says \u2014 We see the rude carpentry of primitive days. The beams have the appearance of having been roughly finished off with the adze. Their supports rest upon projecting stones or corbels, and across one of these, the second from the westward, is cut in old English letters \"BHuJ.tBI, and something else which is not very decipherable. On one side ot* the westernmost is a sort of hieroglyphic, the two being probably Masons' marks. In ancient times the Freemasons used to travel about Europe, building churches wherever they were required, and these may be records left by the fraternity. The tower serves as a beacon for ships on the Thames, and is a Conservancy mark for clearing shoals in Barking and Erith Reaches. It is also of service in the practice of military surveys, for which reason the Government recently provided it with a new flagstaff. The tower consists of four stages and contains four bells, the largest cast in 1796 and the others in 1686, as shown by dates upon them. The height of the tower is 85 feet. Poetical Tomb-Stones. \u2014 Oft quoted and familiar as it is, I must not omit to mention the grave-stone which says : \u2014 James Darling, died 23rd July, 1812, aged 10 years. Weep not for me, my parents Dear There is no Witness wanted here. The hammer of Death was given to me For eating the Cherris off the tree. Next moning Death was to me so sweet My blised Jesus for to meet."], [250, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 564 He did ease me of my pain And i did join his holy train. The cruel one his death can't shun, For he must go when his glass is run, The horrows of Death 'isure to meet And tak his trial at the Judgment Seat. The brief facts of the tragedy, as related in Warlike Woolwich, are as follow : \u2014 Little Darling, who was a cartridge boy in the Arsenal, was caught stealing cherries in an orchard, somewhere near the spot where the Queen's Arms stands in Burrage Road, and died next clay, as alleged, from the punishment he then received. His captor was tried and acquitted for lack of a witness to prove the charge, but the dissatisfied friends of the youth devised this novel method of stinging him with an epitaph. An earlier poetical effort was essayed by the widow of John Titherson. He died in 174-3, and his gravestone is carved with this couplet : \u2014 In this dark bed doth he A husband dear, and so must I. The widow's name, however, does not appear on the stone, but there has recently been added the name of another Mrs. Titherson who died in 1864. Church Tablets.' \u2014 Scraps of local history may further be gathered from the memorial tablets in the church, of which the following are the most important : \u2014 Peter Denham, Esq., died April ye 19th 1736, aged 64, leaving John, his only surviving son, and Elizabeth, wife of John Lidgbird, Esq. To the memory of that truly valuable man, John Lidgbird, Esq., of Shooters' Hill, who died 1771, aged 70. Erected by his son Henry, who died unmarried 1820, aged 76. Among the later tablets are memorials to Henry William Gordon, 1870, son of Sir Henry Gordon ; General Douglas, R.A., 1827 ; John Martin, Esq., of Burrage House, of which he was an inhabitant for 65 years, died in 1813, aged 93 ; and General Sir Thomas Blomefield of Shooters' Hill. The sun-dial over the church porch is dated 1818, and bears the names of Martin Johnson and Samuel Harwood, churchwardens. It was about their time that the ruinous state of the church was rectified, but the rubbish, which buried the floor three feet deep, was not removed, as already stated, until about 1870. The accumulation must have marked a long period of decay and neglect \u2014 at least 100 years. It is probable that the \"restorations\" of 1662 did not extend to the original floor, as long-existing vaults and interments were found above the ancient surface. Amongst many fragments of moulded stone, caps of columns, and carved arches, there was near the eastern end the leaden coffin of a child ; and this was reburied at the western end opposite"], [251, "565 PLUMSTEAD. the door. There were also two large vaults, substantially built and having arches above the old floor. One of these was quite full of adult coffins, some of which were removed to the other vault, and then the upper portions of both were cut down to the present level. The Churchyard. \u2014 The older part of the churchyard, surrounding the church, has unquestionably been used as a burial ground for many centuries, during not a few of which the Thames tide ebbed and flowed close beside it. A convenient meadow south of the churchyard, which ought to have been added to it much earlier, was on the afternoon of August 29th, 1860, taken into the sacred enclosure by the act of consecration. The Bishop of London* performed the ceremonial, attended by the Rev. W. Acworth, Vicar, and the churchwardens, Capt. Steele, R.A., and Mr. W. Lenton. The newly formed Plumstead Artillery Volunteer Corps assisted in preserving order. In Plumstead churchyard, especially in the older portion now closed against interments, t there are many tombs and grave-stones which may interest us. Near the porch is the tomb of the Lord Bishop of Cloyne (William Bennett) who died in 1820, also of Beveridge Clendon, curate of this parish, 1783, and the Rev. S. Watson, senior chaplain, R.A., for many years curate of Plumstead, who died 1837. East of the church will be found the family vault of the Pattison family, inchuling the \"Martin branch, beginning with James Pattison, 1761, and including General James Pattison, 1805.

Plumstead was transferred to the diocese of London in pursuance of the Act 6 and 7, William IV., cap. 67, and reunited to Rochester in 1867 by the London Diocese Act, 1863. On August Sth, 1845, an order in Council was made under the William IV. act, in accordance with a recommendation of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, directing that on January lst, 1846, the following parishes should be transferred from the diocese of Rochester to the diocese of London : \u2014 Plumstead, Woolwich, Charlton, Eltham, Greenwich, Lee, Lewisham, and Deptford. The London Diocese Act, 1863, enacted that these parishes should be restored to the See of Rochester on its next vacancy, which occurred 6th April, 1867. + An order dated August 16th, 1859, forbade burials in the church, and closed the gTave-yard with modifications.

But even in Mrs. Artfill's cottage, and the smaller chapels of its infancy at Plumstead, the brightest lights of Methodism have shone, and very few of the great preachers of the Wesleyan order have failed to aid in tbe great work of extension which has been continuously progressing here for eighty years. The circuit, which formerly included Green wich, Deptford, Chiselhurst, Woolwich, Charlton, Plumstead, and all tbe district to Gravesend, is now condensed into the three towns of the Woolwich Poor Law Union. The Rev. William Morley Punshon was a local preacher in this circuit, and his uncle, the Rev. B. Clough, was its senior minister. Conduit Road Baptist Chapel. \u2014 The origin of Conduit Road Chapel came from a few friends meeting in a room in Raglan Road, under the pastoral care of Mr. G. E. Arnold, who travelled regularly from London to conduct the services,* but afterwards settled here. As numbers were continually being added it became necessary to find better accommodation, and then the present site was secured with a resolve to build. A commencement was made in 1864, and the opening took place January 12th, 1865. A Sunday-school was started, and the cbapel hou^e was used until it became too small, when recourse was bad to the chapel, where for several years it continued to prosper. In 1873 and 1874 the chapel was taken by the London School Board during the erection of Bloomfield Road Schools. On their leaving for the new premises it was resolved by the chapel committee to add to the money received from the Board and improve the interior, which, though well built with gault bricks and cement, was very cold and cheerless. A new floor and joists were laid, new pews fixed, walls were coloured, and a gallery erected at the end ofthe building. These improvements made * See page 154."], [258, "572 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DLSTRICT. it necessary to find fresh accommodation for the children, and funds were raised to erect a new school. Land was secured at the rear of the chapel, and with the money collected and the proceeds of a bazaar, opened by Mr. J. E. Saunders, J.P., M.B., M.L.S.B., which realised \u00a3240, the building was commenced, the foundation-stone being laid by Mr. W. H. Stone, November, 1880. The total cost of building and land was about \u00a3600. It is a model school, containing ten class rooms at the end, opposite a moveable platform, all of which rooms can be used in case of lectures, concerts, &c. The building was opened by Mr. H. M. Bompas, Q.C. The next move was to see about improv ing the interior of the chapel. Another bazaar was held in 1884, which was opened by Sir E. J. Reed, R.C.B., M.P., and realised about \u00a3230. The build ing was then completely reno vated. Increasing business en gagements compelled Mr. Arnold, who had for twenty-one Conduit Road Chapel, Plumstead. years held the pastorate, to give up the work in 1886, and it was then that the committee secured the services of the Rev. C. W. Townsend, \u25a0of Inskip, Lancashire, who commenced his labours in June, 1886. Primitive Methodists. \u2014 The Primitive Methodists are a seedling, rather than a splinter, from the parent stock, the Wesleyan Method ists. Mr. Hugh Bourne and Mr. William Clowes raised the young growth in Staffordshire in the year 1810, but it was not until 1825 that it reached the Metropolis. For many years its people laboured under great disadvantages and formidable difficulties, so that in the year 1835 they had not any chapel property and very few members in society. But by strenuous and persevering efforts great advancement has been made, until they now have many chapels in London and its surroundings and some six thousand members in church fellowship. In about the year 1846, Mrs. Salter, the sister of the late Mr. Alfred Day, and sister of the present Mr. Henry Day, came from Chippenham to reside at Plumstead, and she, being a Primitive Methodist and finding no society in the neighbourhood, sent an invitation to the ministers in London to"], [259, "PLUMSTEAD. 573 come and mission Woolwich and Plumstead. She died at the age of eighty-three in the year 1885, in the fifty-second year of her member ship with the Primitive Methodists. The work was carried on under the following superintendents in succession for many years : \u2014 The Rev. Messrs. Austin, Lamb, Toulson, Penrose, Pindar, Symonds, Phillips, Danzy Sheen, Allen, and Langham. The Rev. John Phillips in the year 1868 made the station into an independent circuit, and in the following year this new circuit was called to sustain a most trying ordeal by the closing of the Woolwich Dockyard, but under the prudent and persevering efforts of Mr. Phillips it out lived the storm. After the Rev. Danzy Sheen had been on the station three years, Mr. Phillips was invited to return, and did so in the year 1874. He laboured very successfully for five years more, but, his health failing him after forty-three years' work in the ministry, he was superannuated and located in Plumstead. This circuit embraced Plumstead, Woolwich, Belvedere, Erith, and Wickham, until 1889, Tlie Per. John Phillip when Woolwich was made a separate circuit under the Rev. T. Peat field and the Rev. J. Phillips. Robert Street Chapel. \u2014 Robert Street Chapel was built under the superintendence of the Rev. Thomas Penrose in 1863. Union Chapel, Sun Street, Woolwich, was procured by the Rev. Danzy Sheen and Mr. Henry Day, while the Rev. John Phillips built an excellent chapel at Belvedere. There is also a good chapel at Erith, and a hired one in Wickham Lane. The present minister is the Rev. J. Turley. Eglinton Road Chapel. \u2014 The chapel in Upper Eglinton Road was built by the Rev. John Phillips and the Rev. William Allen in 1881 after about a year's labour both out of doors and in a small room in Ripon Road. There was till then no Nonconformist place of worship on the Shooters' Hill estate, and a person having offered to give the site on condition that the Primitive Methodist Society would raise at least \u00a3600 in three years, it was accepted and the money raised in one year. The land was then presented to the trustees, and the chapel built, above \u00a31,000 being laid out on the building. But about two years after the opening the trustees were astonished to learn that the person assuming to present the land was never possessed of it, and that the land was the property of the British Land Company. However, in December, 1884, an amicable arrangement was made, but the trustees had to pay \u00a3100 for the land and expenses. Crescent Boad Chapel. \u2014 Crescent Road Chapel was built in o o"], [260, "574 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 1860 or 1861, as an Independent Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, by the friends of the Rev. Thomas S. Wilson, who was the first minister ; he died July 28th, 1863. After his death the chapel was taken over by the Rent Congregational Association and Home Missionary Society, the late Mr. Samuel Morley finding the funds. Tbe Rent Association appointed to the charge the Rev. T. Davies, who resigned after a ministry of two years, and was followed successively by the Rev. J. B. Pike, the Rev. J. R. Stallybrass, and the Rev. F. Haydn Williams. Mr. Williams resigned in 1880, and the chapel was sold to the Wesleyan Methodist Free Church, who still possess it. The first Free Methodist preacher was the Rev. J. E. Shepherd, the second was the Rev. J. Pitchford, and the pastorate is at the present time under the direction of the Rev. J. Layland. The Tabernacle. \u2014 Plumstead Tabernacle, at the corner of Maxey Road and Dawson Street, was built by the Particular Baptists in 1861, and was first opened under the leadership of Mr. Leech. To him succeeded Mr. Hembridge from Tenterden, and then came an anxious period in which the light was kept burning for a while by supplies, and then put out altogether. This was about 1869, but in the follow ing year Mr. George Webb, from Eynsford, came to Plumstead and reopened the Tabernacle, resuming and carrying on the work with all his energies and with greater success than it had ever previously attained. Mr. Webb remained until a few years since, when he claimed the privilege of rest. Mr. Warner and Mr. Lee ministered after this on Particular Baptist principles, and at the present time the doctrine of the Gospel Standard, which is another form of Particular Baptism, is held by the congregation of the Tabernacle under the leadership of Mr. Waller. Union Church. \u2014 Union Church, Park Road, was built by the Baptists in 1885, an overswarm from Conduit Road Chapel having for some months previously been established under the lead of the Rev. J. W. Cole at the Raglan Assembly Room in Raglan Road. The rapid extension of Plumstead in the direction of the new church rendered it exceedingly welcome in the neighbourhood, and a large congregation immediately gathered round the nucleus which accompanied Mr. Cole from the Raglan Hall to Park Road. Bible Christians. \u2014 The Bible Christians' Church in Herbert Road is an architectural ornament which has no superior in church or chapel at Plumstead. It is said to have cost \u00a34,000, and, although some hundreds were expended in securing a foundation, the money appears to have been made the most of. Notwithstanding the ornate character of their temple, the Bible Christians are an unassuming sect, with a primitive service, simplified from that of the Wesleyan body,."], [261, "PLUMSTEAD. 575 whence they have descended. The Bible Christians, or \" O'Brienites\" as they were at first called, came out in 1815, and a branch was estab lished at Woolwich about 1830, worship being carried on in the disused theatre on Church Hill, now a pair of dwelling-houses next the church yard. The society afterwards purchased Zion Chapel in Upper Market Street, Woolwich, of Mr. Bossey, who was forty years constructor in the Royal Carriage Department, and father of two local surgeons. Mr. Bossey built Zion Chapel in 1828. It was in 1887 converted into a school, the Bible Christians having abandoned it for their new home at Herbert Road in 1886. Mr. I. B. Vanstone (who came with the congregation from Woolwich) having completed the four years' ministry allotted by the rules of the connection, was on the opening of the new church invited to remain. The Clifton Castle, Plumstead. Clifton Castle Mission House. \u2014 The large house which is the centre of the excellent work carried on under the name of \" The Clifton Castle Mission,\" stands conspicuously in Cage Lane, and owes its origin to a strange individual familiarly known as \"Billy Canoe.\" His patronymic was properly Edwards, but when I first beheld him, in the old steamboat days of the eighteen-forties, he was styled \"Robin son Crusoe.\" He always lived, I believe, at Woolwich, but he frequented all the piers up-river, and his favourite \"pitch\" was old Hungerford, now transformed into Charing Cross. To the boys of that day he was a marvellous hero. In his little canvas-decked boat he would paddle round about the steamers and vanish \u2014 boat and all \u2014 oo2"], [262, "576 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. under water, to reappear on the other side of the vessel. I was taught to believe that he and his craft dived under the keel, and I have believed it to this day. He was certainly a good swimmer, and, being constantly on the water, was instrumental in saving some lives, his rule in such cases being to ask for his reward \u2014 a silver crown-piece, on which he would have engraved a record of the event. This career he followed for probably thirty years ; the holiday-makers on the steamers gave him liberally of their support, and, as he lived frugally in the humbler part of Woolwich, adding to his income by keeping a lodging house or two, he saved a good sum of money, part of which he lost in building the tavern in Cage Lane, which he called the Clifton Castle, but had to close for want of trade. About this time, trouble coming double, the police were set at him by some moral or envious informer, and \" Billy Canoe \" was arrested on a charge of begging. We then learned his real name, and in his own person he promised the lawgivers at Woolwich Police-court never to offend again. But he was further accused of defacing Her Majesty's coin, and his five shilling \"medals,\" which he had had engraved and proudly wore in public upon his breast, were produced as witnesses against him. It was somewhat harsh, I thought, to make all this solemn fuss about a man who was at worst only an amusing marine mountebank, but the powers of the law were probably actuated by a correct motive when they confiscated his medals, and sent them to the Mint, at the same time severely admonishing poor crestfallen Billy concerning his future behaviour. He kept his promise to give up his profession on the water, and for the rest of his days devoted himself to the less romantic avocation of lodging poor travellers at fourpence a night. He died at Woolwich, aged 71, in June, 1884. Miss Russell has for a number of years conducted the schools and mission work carried on at the Clifton Castle. The work has been exceedingly prosperous, and there are in the schools at the present time more than 700 children. Plumstead Charities.\u2014 The following account of the Plumstead Charities was prepared in 1853 : \u2014 - Wilham Cole, by his will, dated the fifth day of June, 1807, gave to the ministers, churchwardens, and overseers of Plumstead the sum of one thousand pounds, to be placed out, and the interest to be from time to time applied towards supporting the Sunday schools in the same parish. This legacy was invested, 4th April 1808 in Navy five per cents., in the names of the vicar and parish officers of Plumste'ad John Budgen, Esq., on the 21st of October, 1807, granted a lease of a piece of ground for a term of nine hundred years, at the nominal rent of one penn3-, for the purpose of building a school-house, conditioned to be void if the schools should be discontinued for eighteen months, or the budding be used for any other purpose A school-house was accordingly built, the charges of which were defrayed by private subscription. It contains separate rooms for the instruction of the boys and girls and"], [263, "577 PLUMSTEAD. for the residence of the master and mistress. The national system of education was adopted in 1817, and in April, 1819, fifty-seven boys and fifty girls partook of the benefits of the establishment, when the expenditure consisted of: \u2014 \u00a3 s. d. Salary to the master 60 0 0 Do. to the mistress 20 0 0 Books and stationery . . . . . 10 0 0 Coals and repairs 10 0 0 besides annual subscriptions, occasional contributions, and a quarterage of a shilling from each of the children who attend the school.* Henry Kipling, by will dated the 12th of January, 1821, gave to the minister, churchwardens, and overseers of Plumstead, five hundred and eighty-two pounds, ten shillings, and sixpence, three per cent, consols, towards supporting and keeping up the Sunday school in the said parish. This bequest stood in the names of the Rev. Baden Powell, George Bodie, and John Budgen. Edward Smith, by will dated March 24th, 1654, settled an annuity of forty shil- lings out of a messuage and lands at Orsett, in the county of Essex, which premises and land he had since sold, having undertaken to discharge the same annuity, directed his executors to pay to the churchwardens, &c, of Plumstead, a sum not exceeding fifty pounds, and therewith to purchase lands or an annuity of the value of forty shillings, and that in case the said churchwardens, &c, should not agree, he then bequeathed to his executors fifty pounds in trust that they should purchase the same, aiipf until they had done so, that they should pay forty shillings as interest of the said fifty pounds, in discharge of the said annuity. Jeoffrey Smith, executor to Edward Smith, shortly after died, and Edward Smith, his executor, proved his will, and entered into possession of lands mentioned in the said will, and had for divers years after his death paid the said forty shillings per annum, but that the said forty shillings at this date, 1678, for six years last past amounting to twelve pounds, he refused to pay it, when it was ordered by the com missioners of charitable use at that time existing to be paid, and that he and his heirs, owners of the aforesaid lands, should thenceforth yearly on Michaelmas Day pay to the churchwardens and overseers of Plumstead for the time being the sum of forty shil- lings to be by them employed for the uses of the said will. John Gossage by his will, dated the fifth day of October, 1699, bequeathed fifty- two shillings a year, that is one shilling on each Lord's Da)-, in bread to the poor of the parish. This is paid as a charge upon a piece of land in this parish, belonging to St. Thomas's Hospital and in the occupation of Mrs. Wren. Hannah Scott, by will dated the 17th day of September, 1677, bequeathed to the parish one hundred pounds, to be laid out by the churchwardens and overseers in the purchase of lands, and the rents thereof to be distributed in bread every Sunday, between \"Michaelmas and Lady Day, and receiving that by lease and release, bearing date 18th and 19th June, 1690, between Thomas Willey and Robert Poyner, and five others ; said Thomas Willey, in consideration of one hundred and twenty-two pounds, of which one hundred pounds was given by the said Hannah Scott, and ten pounds \"by John Scott, her executor, conveyed to the said Robert Poyner and others certain premises called Logg's Hill and Barclay's Croft, in the parish of Bromley, containing nine acres, with a provision that as often as the number of trustees should be reduced to two, the survivors should convey the premises to the use of themselves, and such four others, substantial inhabitants of the said parish, as the churchwardens and * Under an order of the Charity Commissioners the bequests to the old schools in the village (page 560), and the rents arising both from that building and the schools subsequently erected in Crescent Road (now headquarters, 3rd Kent Artillery Volun teers), were transferred to other schools in the parish."], [264, "RECORDS OE THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 578 overseers should appoint, and reciting indentures of lease and release, dated the 28th and 29th of September : John Budgen and five others, the then trustees, of the first part, Jeremiah Milsted, and three others, churchwardens and overseers of Plumstead, of the second part, and John Wells of the third part ; whereby John Wells proposed to become the purchaser of the said premises for eight hundred and forty pounds, which was considered a manifest improvement of the trust. With the approbation of the said churchwardens and overseers, the premises were conveyed to the said John Wells and his heirs ; the purchase money was invested in tlie names of the said trustees, and employed in the purchase of nine hundred and seventy-five pounds, fifteen shillings, four per cent, consols. It was declared that the said stock was purchased in their names in the first place, to indemnify John Wells and his heirs for twenty years, and on trust that the trustees might sell and apply the produce of the stock in the purchase of land, if they should think fit. This stock stands in the names of John Budgen, William Stace, Thomas Cleave, and Henry Mason. By an entry in the vestry book, 27th of October, 1812, it was agreed that James Ward, of Shooters' Hill, should from Michaelmas, 1808, pay two pounds yearly for two pieces of waste land, containing thirty- seven perches, adjoining the London Road on the north,* one half to the poor of the parish, the other half to be paid to Queen's College, Oxford ; there is also another quit rent of one pound, payable out of a portion of Plumstead Common, south-east of Edmund's t Lane, containing about half an acre. The Almshouses. \u2014 The new Almshouses at the upper part of Park Road were raised by a public subscription promoted by Col. Edwin Hughes, M.P. They were built upon a site given by Mr. Robert Rersey, in 1884. The first committee of management was elected at a meeting of subscribers, held at the Parochial Offices, Plumstead, in 1883, and was composed as follows : \u2014 Trustees :\u2014 Mr. Edwin Hughes, Mr. Thomas Boxshall, Mr. Robert Low, Mr. Thomas Nelson Moors, Mr. Francis Alfred White. Members elected by the Donors : \u2014 Mr. William Thomas Vincent, Mr. John Kettle Paine, Major William Martin Frobisher, Mr. Frank Smith, Mr. Wilham Tongue.

Secretary : \u2014 Mr. William Godfrey Thomas. The High Schools. \u2014 In 1879 a movement was originated for the establishment of middle-class education, and, after some preliminary meetings at the house of Mr. G. E. Arnold, the Woolwich and Plum stead High School Association was enrolled, Mr. W. Tongue being * This land was probably situate on the Shooters' HU1 Road, near the boundary of East Wickham.

A beginning was made in September of the same year by opening a Boys' School at the disused premises adjoining the Scotch Church in New Road. In October, 1881, the foundation-stone of the Boys' School at Brook Hill was laid by Lord Mayor McArthur, and on March 4th, 1882, the place was opened by Lord Mayor Ellis. The Girls' School in Cambridge Place had previously been built, and was opened on May 3rd, 1880. In 1888 the whole property was transferred to the manage ment of the Church Schools Company. ' Mr. G. Whale, solicitor, subsequently became chairman and Mr. A. Bayly secretary."], [266, "CHAPTER XLV. GROWTH AND GOVERNMENT OF PLUMSTEAD. Population. \u2014 In following the advancement of this parish the only figures on which we can base The River Wall at Plumstead. an estimate prior to the first census in 1801 are the registers of the baptisms and burials, and these are even less reliable than usual, in consequence of the large extent to which Plumstead Old Church and churchyard were resorted to by residents at Woolwich. However, they may be taken at a discount value. From these returns it may be gathered that, like its neighbours, Plumstead has had a healthy growth from the beginning, with occa sional stimulations. In 1795 there were 120 houses in the parish, in 1801 they had increased to 214, and in 1810 the number was 320. The increase was almost entirely in the corner nearest the gates of the Royal Arsenal.

Local Government. \u2014 The government of Plumstead was of a primitive kind until 1856, when the parish was brought within the authority of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and formed, with the parishes of Charlton, Eltham, Lee, and Ridbrook, into the Plumstead District. First Steps. \u2014 Before the passing of the Metropolis Local Manage ment Acts and the formation of this district, the various parishes in cluded in it were under the ancient government of overseers, Boards of Guardians, and Highway Boards, the latter often spreading over a wide area. It was considered a great move forward when Mr. Tongue, who was surveyor of highways for Plumstead under the Dartford Board in 1849-50, purchased two water-carts to lay7 the dust, which was an inch thick in the Plumstead Road. Mr. Tongue obtained leave to draw water free from the Arsenal Canal and put a three-inch pipe through the canal bank for the purpose. The foreman of the roads at that time was about eighty years of age, and was also Vestry Clerk, but a young man named Bray* was sent, by request, from Mr. Howard's office at Dartford to keep the Plumstead highway accounts. A new road fore man, named Eves, also came from Dartford, some better metal than the native gravel was found for the main road, and, under the lead of Messrs. Cook, Cay, Jessup, and others, matters were beginning to mend before the new Board came into being. The First Paving. \u2014 The first curbstone was laid in 1850 by Mr. Tongue in Plumstead Boad, and he it was who eleven years later intro duced into the parish the now universal tar-paving, laying down a speci men in front of his residence at Montem Villa, Burrage Boad, in 1861. This was the very first bit of tar-paving laid in the London district. Old Habits. \u2014 The overseers of Plumstead opened a banking account about 1850, previous to which it was customary to retain in their own possession the money received from the rate collectors. The Poor Law. \u2014 Although much benefited by the introduction of the District Board in 1856, the parish remained, for Poor Law purposes, in the Lewisham Union until 1868, when it was amalgamated in the new union of \"Woolwich. Parish Offices. \u2014 The parish offices in Maxey Boad were built on a site leased from the Burrage Estate in the year 1865. The overseers, by authority of the Vestry, purchased in 1862 a piece of freehold land on Plumstead Common, known as Sot's Hole, for the site of a Vestry Hall, but this was sold to the Metropolitan Board and added to the * Mr. Bray was afterwards for many years known throughout the County as the proprietor of the Bull Hotel and Corn Exchange at Dartford."], [273, "583 PLUMSTEAD. Common in 1886, and the purchase money was employed in enlarging the offices in 1887. Sot's Hole. \u2014 Sot's Hole was used as a dust shoot until it became level ground, but it was formerly a hollow place on the northern side of the highway, left when the road was raised, perhaps a hundred years earlier. There were a couple of old cottages standing in it, one of which had been a tavern, and was said to have given to the place its ugly name. In the Kentish Independent of February 13th, 1858, it was stated that \u2014 On Monday afternoon a man was collecting road scrapings with a horse and cart on Plumstead Common opposite a place called Sot's Hole, where two cottages are built in a hollow by the roadside some dozen feet below the level, and attempted to back the cart into the channel. The cart, wliich was loaded, crossed the footpath (an inclined plane), and, breaking through the hedge, feU over, and went through the front waU of the old building, horse, cart, and contents alighting in the family par lour. Three children who were sitting by the fire escaped almost by a miracle, and it was two hoius before the horse was extricated. Plumstead Common as it was. \u2014 Now that we have reached Plumstead Common we approach a stirring theme. The subject of Plumstead Common has already been mentioned in reference to the supposed barrow which stands on the eastern plateau and was used as a butt by the early artillerymen.* To that military adoption, the Com- mon may trace much ofits misfortune. As early as 1784 the firing of mortars and cannon and the erection of platforms on Plumstead Com- mon was objected to in a memorial to the Board of Ordnance from the inhabitants ; but the Government, ever since troops were first garrisoned at Woolwich, have claimed and maintained the right to make use of this Common as an exercising ground, and to the assertion of this privilege we may attribute the present ruinous condition of the remoter half. In the early part of the present century, when Woolwich Com- mon was purchased and cleared of its bushes, Plumstead Common began to be let alone, and no place could have been more wild and picturesque than it was when the boys of 1850 roamed thereon. From one end to the other \u2014 that is, from Burrage Boad to Wickham Lane \u2014 it was clad in yellow furze and heather and verdure. Its surface was scored and scarred here and there by the gravel diggers, but it was a delightful spot, no less on the eastern side of the Slade ravine than at the nearer end, where the boys were wont to storm the rocky \" castle \"t which has * See page 13. t A projecting geologic formation of a conglomerate commonly known as \" pud ding\" rock. Viewed from various aspects it presents in several shapes the outline of a human head."], [274, "584 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. happily been saved from utter demolition by a timely fence. The lines of Sir Walter Scott may be applied to the heath \u2014 \u2022 On whose uncultured breast Among the broom, and thorn, and whin A truant boy, I sought the nest,- Or listed, as I lay at rest, While rose on breezes thin, The murmur of the busy crowd, And from his steeple jingling loud, Saint Nicholas's din. If we want to see what the Common was like forty years ago we may judge from the steep fragment at the extreme east, which has aloneescaped the ravages of the despoilers. The furze and broom and heather are as beautiful there as they ever were. But over the rest of the Common, even though much has been done to rescue and restore it, time has written devastation. The Plumstead Common Shindy. \u2014 Let us now discuss for the benefit of future generations the bloodless but long and bitter battle of Plumstead Common. One of the chief morals learnt from that memorable contest may be summed up in the following quotation : \u2014 Mine son, don't you never have no opinions about nothing. This was the advice of the old Dutch innkeeper, Nick Vedder, and other philosophers, before and since, have come to the same conclusion. In the great hurly-burly of Plumstead Common in 1876, nearly all the population within the area of its influence took a more or less active interest, many who entered the controversy in its smooth beginnings were drawn by force into the vortex of as fierce and bitter a strife as ever waged within these townships, and only they who were wise and fortunate remained neutral and unbiassed or kept their opinions to themselves. Time, the great healer, has long assuaged the enmities and prejudices begotten of that memorable struggle. Later events have helped to dispel the rancorous spirit of the conflict, and, now that nothing is left us but the best of its fruits, we can afford to enjoy the more pleasant of its reminiscences without the fear of disturbing any of the dregs which for a long while after the trouble had ended imparted to the subject a disagreeable flavour. Whatever may have been said and suspected at the time, whatever may have been the motives and the objects of the contending parties, it must now be allowed on all hands that the effect of the commotion was to bring a flood of light upon the question at issue, and to accomplish eventually the preservation of the great playground which we happily possess on Plumstead Common, some years at least before that purpose could have been gained by more peaceful and less powerful measures."], [275, "585 PLUMSTEAD. Distant Rumblings. \u2014 Almost as long as we can remember there had been an agitation concerning Plumstead Common. \"Until the Cri mean War time (1854-5) the parish had scarcely emerged from its infancy. The little village was still the centre of its old-fashioned business, and the villagers did all the public work there was to do in a village kind of way. But even then the boy-reporter who was accus tomed to attend the vestry meetings in the old church took note of cer tain murmurings regarding enclosures of odd corners on Plumstead Common, and heard vaguely of requisitions for courts-leet and settle ments which never came. The ownership of the soil being vested for educational purposes in the hands of the Trustees of Queen's College, Oxford, was a circumstance which complicated the subject, both by reason of the difficult distance for striking, and the natural reluctance there was to attack so excellent an institution, whose acts of spoliation were, moreover, generally covered by some charitable excuse. Many of the bits which were nibbled off the fringes of the Common were bestowed in the early days of the present century upon poor widows to keep them from the workhouse. The Challenge. \u2014 But larger and less defensible perversions took place subsequent to 1850, and the Trustees of the College, grown reck less by impunity, began to assert their title as freeholders to the whole of the soil, and actually sold large plots of the land in several places. Among these was a tract of some acres to the east of Cage Lane (which, however, was never enclosed), a portion of the garden lands at the Slade, and the plot which lies between the Central Schools and Burrage Boad. This last-named was the chief bone of contention when the collision came. But for a long while the College met with no resistance stronger than verbal protests from the local vestry and strong speeches at public meetings, for the parish had begun to grow then, and was in its vigorous youth \u2014 wanting experience, perhaps, but passionate and strong. Law. \u2014 At length the cudgels were taken up by Messrs. Warrick, Dawson, and other men of public spirit, and legal action was com menced. The action was brought by John Warrick, Julian Goldsmid, Wilham Edward Dawson, and Joseph Jacobs, on behalf of themselves and all the other tenants of the manor of Plumstead, against the Provost and scholars of Queen's College in the University of Oxford and the Bev. Wm. Jackson, and the cause was filed in the Court of Chancery on August 4th, 1866. The following is an abbreviated statement of the case from the pleadings : \u2014 Mr. Warrick was a resident at East Wickham, Mr. Julian is now Sir Julian Gold smid M.P., and Messrs. Dawson and Jacobs were well-known Plumstead inhabitants."], [276, "586 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The plaintiffs' statement alleged that in 1720 the whole of the lands in Plumstead and East Wickham were held from the Lord of the Manor, who was at that time Mr. John Michel, of Richmond. Mr. John Warrick proved his title to be regarded a tenant of the manor by ownership of the Plume of Feathers tavern, and traced the succession backwards to 1741 . The title of Mr. Jacobs was similarly asserted by his lease of the windmill and other premises on Plumstead Common, and it was shown that the windmill was built in 1788 on two acres of land lying open and waste, but distin guished by a trench dug round. Sir Julian Goldsmid claimed in respect'of land at East Wickham, and Mr. Dawson for \"divers parcels\" which were traced back to the Lords of the Manor in 1712. All the plaintiffs alleged that they had the right of pasture on Plumstead Common, Bostall Heath, and Shoulder-of-Mutton Green for cattle, geese, &c, the right to cut turf and furze and fern, and the right to dig sand and gravel. They also asserted the privilege of using these open spaces for \" lawful village sports, games, and pastimes.\" The accusation was that the College had about the year 1816 enclosed two plots (the one is now Blendon Terrace, .and the other a strip at the south-west corner of Bramblebury Road) without any serious objection being made. And on August 6th, 1846, a court-leet was held at wliich the jury (Mr. W. E. Dawson dissenting) resolved upon the entire enclosure of Plumstead Common and Bostall Heath under the powers of the General Enclosure Act. In 1848-9, meetings in furtherance of the project were held at the Plume of Feathers, but, from legal defects, the scheme was abandoned. Some years afterwards, however, the College enclosed a large plot at the Slade (extending from Cage Lane to beyond Chesnut Road) which had formerly been held by the churchwardens as allotments for the poor at a nominal rent of 15s. a year, and the same was advertised for building. About 1857, the site of the Central Schools was taken in, and from that year until 1866 several other enclosures took place in the same locality, now covered by the Prince of Wales alehouse and the houses in St. Margaret's Road. Proceedings were taken when the school site was appropriated, but the act was held to be justified by the purpose in view, and the Slade Schools * were afterwards built on the Common with out dispute. The intention of the College, however, was apparently to take gradual possession ofthe whole Common, and the inhabitants saw with dismay in 1866 that fences were put up to enclose the triangular patch in front of Heathfield, the pictu resque piece east of Bleakhill, the whole of the hollow fronting the Central Schools, and a small strip in front of Mr. Dawson's pottery. The Plumstead Board knocked down part of the fence near the Central Schools under a claim of right to dig gravel, and an action for trespass resulted, but the main issue was not raised, and it was simply settled that the Board should have gone to some open part of the Common for its gravel. Under these dispiriting circumstances, the inhabitants saw preparations making for fencing off another shee (behind the present workhouse), and a post and rail actually put all round Bostall Heath at one bold move. At the same time it was found tha '\u25a0' pposals were afoot for selling part of the Common to the military authorities for a ] .'-ground, and to entirely shut in the remainder ; and the inhabitants of East am saw a fence put completely round about their little \"green.\" These acts, which happened in March, 1866, roused Mr. Warrick and others, who pulled down part ofthe fence at Shoulder-of-Mutton Green, and were served with notice of action, wliich was not followed up. Then the plaintiffs, Warrick, Goldsmid, Dawson, and Jacobs, entered their action against the College, alleging all these acts as invasions of their rights as tenants of the Manor, and asserting that the College had already, in 1862, executed a conveyance of some portion of the \" waste \" to the War Office, to the pre judice of the tenants. * These old schools were associated with the church of St. Nicholas. They were superseded by the Board schooj* near Garland Street a few years since."], [277, "587 PLUMSTEAD. Judgment. \u2014 On April 25, 1870, judgment in the suit was given by the Master of the Bolls (Lord Boniilly), and it was in favour of the plaintiffs with costs. This was appealed against, and on Aug. 2, 1871, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Ilatherley) also pronounced judgment, which ordered the College to remove all the fences which they had erected since the commencement of 1866, that being the year in which the action was brought, costs again to be paid by the College. These decisions affected only Plumstead Common and Bostall Heath ; they did not touch Shoulder-of-Mutton Green, which was, however, included in the later negotiations. The Military Claim. \u2014 By the Lord Chancellor's judgment, the indolence and indifference of the inhabitants prior to 1866 was inten tionally punished, and the decision would doubtless have been accepted as a satisfactory settlement of all disputes if the quarrel had not been turned to account by another adversary, and this no other than that puissant minister of the Queen, the Secretary of State for War. From time immemorial the War Office had undoubtedly enjoyed the prescrip tive right of exercising troops on Plumstead Common, but availed themselves of the privilege only to a slight extent, such as in the occa sional training of a few horses, or the rare occurrence of a sham fight, in one of which, as already told, the upper part of the Old Mill was used as a grand stand and broke down under the unaccustomed strain. In the early part of 1S71, the outburst of the Franco-German War stirred England to defensive action, and the garrison at AVoolwich was full of soldiers, horse and foot. Woolwich Common was not enough for all the drilling there was to do, and it was never a good drill-ground at the best, being of a soft and swampy character ; and thus it came to pass that first a squad and then a battery, and at last whole brigades of artillery were sent on to the Common at Plumstead. The Common Destroyed. \u2014 Every furze bush and bramble soon vanished ; every blade of grass speedily followed, and in a year or two the whole area of the once beautiful Common was a barren desert. Then the indignation of the people culminated. A few clan destine and gradual encroachments might have escaped observation, but the wholesale destruction of their recreation- ground was past endurance. Tardy Rescue. \u2014 Urgent entreaties and indignant demands went up from the local authorities, first to the War Office, and then to the Metropolitan Board, but the former evaded the question, and the latter, though constantly goaded by Mr. Lloyd, the Plumstead representative, moved but slowly forward with a measure for the Common's preserva tion. In 1876, negotiations were taking place with Queen's College for the purchase of the manorial rights, and with the War Office to abate the privileges of all the Queen's horses and men ; but the people were"], [278, "588 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. getting impatient, and an angry fire of discontent was smouldering which only needed a puff of wind to fan it into flame. John De Morgan. \u2014 The breeze came personified in the hero famed in history as John De Morgan. Of Mr. De Morgan little is known before or since the period in which he flashed meteorlike through our section of the atmosphere, but he was indisputably a remarkable man. He has been stigmatised as a professional agitator, but the same thing might be said of many public men, and it must be confessed that during his connection with the Plumstead Common disputes nothing more dis honourable than inflammatory speech was ever laid to his charge. He was appa rently a young man of thirty or so, with a good-looking, intelligent, and well satisfied face ; his long dark hair had a disposition to curl ; and, like some other John de Morgan. great men, he was small. He was possessed of a wonderful tongue, which quickly won his position as leader of the people, and put all the other chieftains out of sight. The Tichborne Association was the means of his introduction to the neighbourhood, and the \" tyrranny of the land grabbers\" opened a free subject for his eloquence. He was not long without a following, and soon came the first blow. The Attack.- \u2014 It was on Saturday the lst of July, 1876, that hostilities began. Popular dissatisfaction, however general and com prehensive it may be, must have a focus, and the public avengement for all the wrongs done to the Common was centred upon the one enclosure at the western end, which had been purchased of the College prior to 1866 by Mr. William Tongue, and fenced in by a close boarded fence from end to end.* Part of this ground had been more recently purchased of Mr. Tongue by Mr. Edwin Hughes, and added to the garden of his house, and it was probably due to Mr. Hughes's public character as a politician that his name was to so large an extent associated with the dispute. Mr. Jacobs, who leased a sandpit from the College at the eastern end ofthe Common, was also in special odium, and the expedition of July lst commenced by operations on his fence, continued in the removal of some posts surrounding Mr. Russell's field close by, and concluded by * It is now covered by the houses on the north side of St. Margaret's Road."], [279, "PLUMSTEAD. 589 an assault on Mr. Tongue's palings at the western extremity of the Common. Through this western enclosure formerly ran two footpaths, one into Maxey Boad and the other into Burrage Boad by way of Conquest Lane. To the latter De Morgan led his train, and cleared away suffi cient of the fence to give access to all who might wish to walk once more through Conquest Lane to Burrage Boad. There were several stormy Saturdays, and some stormy Sundays, after this, the gathering point generally being opposite the western enclosure, and many acts of violence were committed. Numerous charges and summonses came before the magistrate, the police were called out in great numbers, and even the fire brigade men, who were brought on the scene to extinguish the burning furze, got into collision with the people. For half a year the tempest raged, and many things were said and clone which are well forgotten. We will pass them over and come to the trial at Maidstone on Friday, October 20th, 1876. The Trial. \u2014 In all there were eleven defendants, and they were charged with riotous assembly and disturbing the public peace on the lst of July. There were more than a dozen barristers and solicitors engaged in the case. The prosecution was conducted in the name of the Crown, and the evidence was of considerable length. One of the witnesses in support of the charge said : \u2014 I was present at the meeting in the Arsenal Square, and joined the meeting on the Common later. That was at the Olel Mill, near the centre of the Common. There was a band of music playing, and De \"Morgan was in a waggonette. There were some banners, with devices on them. One of the mottoes was, \" Long live De Morgan.\" (Laughter). There were about 1,000 persons present \u2014 mostly artisans of the Arsenal from Woolwich and Plumstead. The crowd continued to increase to such an extent that before the day was over there were 2,000 persons there, including a great number of boys. After the band had ceased playing, De Morgan addressed the people. He said he came there to support the Commoners of Plumstead in the assertion of their rights, according to the promise he had made them. He led the way in the waggonette for a part of the distance towards Jacobs's fences, which were soon afterwards destroyed. About 80 feet were destroyed entirely. There was a speech from De Morgan about every five minutes. De Morgan indicated Russell's fences and led the crowd thither. De Morgan actually pulled up the fences with his hands, stating that he \" undertook his share of the responsibility.\" A small chopper and axe were used for wrenching the wire off. The wire was freshly tarred. Before leaving Russell's, De Morgan said, \" We shall come here next Saturday and finish the work, and we shall now go on to Hughes's.\" He advised them to bring choppers, axes, ropes, crowbars, &c. I told him that I knew Russell's land had been enclosed for many years, and that he had no right to go there. It has every appearance of being enclosed for 100 years. The enclosure of Tongue's land was made before the Lord Chancellor's decree in 1866. De Morgan said, \" Remove six feet of this fen to make a right of way.\" Some one suggested that it would be better to go round to the Burrage Road side, and they went, De Morgan accompanying. On getting there they turned into Conquest Lane, wliich runs out of the Burrage Road, and then went? PP"], [280, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 590 down towards Mr. Tongue's property. There is a gate at the end of he land belonging to Tongue, and De Morgan said, \u00ab Lift that gate off.\" That admitted them to Tongue's property. It was formerly part of the Common, and is wild m its character. The fence was knocked down about 10 feet, and there was knockmg and hammering, after wliich the people went through. The people then went back towards the Arsenal. I was not on the Common on Sunday, but was there on Monday evening about five o'clock. On the Monday and Tuesday evenings there were 10,000 people there. The furze was on fire on Tongue's land and boys and men were running about with firebrands. I never saw a scene so disorderly and lawless. The broken fences were burnt and fire engines came, but the firemen were stoned. Several other witnesses having testified to the law and the facts, counsel for the defence waived the right of calling evidence in order to have the last speech. Sentence, Remission, and Release.\u2014 After a two days' trial, the jury returned a verdict of \" Guilty \" against De Morgan, but all the others were either acquitted or so far exonerated as to be let off with trifling penalties. De Morgan was sentenced to two months' imprison ment. At Woolwich the news of his conviction was received, by his friends with consternation, and their hero was at once exalted to the rank of martyr. Strenuous efforts were made to secure his release, and on the seventeenth day of his incarceration (Sunday, November 5th) he was set at liberty by an order from the Home Secretary. A Great Demonstration. \u2014 The following narrative of the events on the day following caused some amusement at the time, as it was known to have been written by a witness at the trial : \u2014 When it was rumoured on Sunday that De Morgan was out of prison nobody believed it ; it was against all reason and precedent to liberate a prisoner on a Sunday, even supposing one could conjecture ground for his release. Impossible, however, as it seemed, it proved to be true. De Morgan had passed through Woolwich by the train which leaves Maidstone at 2.30 p.m. on Sundays ; had revealed liimself to the officials at the Arsenal Station, and left a note for the chairman of the Plumstead Common League. The joyful intelligence was forthwith proclaimed by a bulletin in the window of the committee's headquarters at the Queen's Arms, Plumstead, and one of the committeemen published it from the well-used roof of the Ordnance Arms to the crowds surrounding the teetotal lecturers and street preachers in Beresford Square. As a natural consequence, the great demonstration which the committee had resolved to make on the anniversary of Gunpowder Plot, which by reason of Sunday being the Fifth was to be held on the Monday, had immense momentum imparted to it by De Morgan's liberation on the very eve of the event. It seemed as though he had been set free on purpose to give eclat to the proposed manifestation. Monday, November 6th, was a day to be remembered in AVoolwich and Plumstead. The weather was propitious. The streets were muddy with recent rain, and the air was chilly with the north-west wind, but the sun had shown himself at intervals, and altogether it was a fair specimen of an English November day. The liberation"], [281, "PLUM.STEAD. 591 of their champion had made the De Morganites exultant in their glee, and their most prominent chiefs were busy all day preparing for the evening reception of De Morgan and the degradation of his adversaries. I was informed that the effigies intended for cremation were exhibited in the parlour of the Queen's Arms, and I was on the way thither to inspect them with a public eye, when I was warned by a friendly traitor from the De Morgan camp that visitors were regarded with suspicion, and that it might be unadvisable to provoke the determined watch-dogs who guarded the sacred fetishes. I accordingly requested my informant to assure the committee of manage ment that I would be with them in the evening, which promise was received with an incredulous smile, and forthwith proceeded to make preparations for performing a public duty with the least risk of personal inconvenience. A trusty hair-dresser furnished an ample beard, and by half-past six o'clock in the evening I was, by the aid ppf an amateur costumier, so transformed that my dearest friends and nearest relations would have utterly disowned me. Beresford Square was a sea of heads. The multitude was even larger than the gigantic assembly wliich gathered in the same place one Saturday afternoon when England's statesman and orator, Mr. Gladstone, addressed the electors for their suf frages. There were, according to my estimate, some twenty thousand people present, the roughs getting the best places, and the more decent people remaining on the outside ; for the crowd got thinner and the crush less severe as the distance from the centre of observation increased. This centre was the parapet of a low projecting part of the Ordnance Arms, which Mr. De Morgan chose haphazard as his rostrum when the Plumstead Common excitement began, and towards this centre I, as one of the roughs aforesaid, squeezed my way, contriving by a little perseverance and ingenuity to get into a dark corner where I could see nothing but could hear all and jot down a few notes without attracting observation. \"Vehement and protracted cheering announced that De \"Morgan had emerged from the window and climbed over the pent-roof to the front, and then somebody, I pre sume it was the chairman, said a few words of introduction. Then spoke the hero of the hour. Said he \u2014 \" The last time I had the honour of addressing you from this balcony I told you that we were engaged in a fight between John De Morgan and the commoners of Plumstead on the one side, and the strongest Conservative Govern ment the country has ever seen on the other. And I also said that whichever way the fight ended it would be a victory for the people. After my two month's imprison ment (for I had said that I would remain to the end of my sentence, and that any one who paid the fine would be an enemy to the cause and to myself) I promised you that I should come back again to Plumstead with more vigour to battle for the people. And the strong Conservative Government had to acknowledge, after seventeen d.ays, that the poor prisoner at Maidstone was more powerful than they. (Cheers.) I was yesterday morning writing in my cell when a warder called in a sepulchral voice that I was wanted I was taken to the governor of the prison, who informed me that he had received an order to discharge me before ten o'clock. I wanted to pack up some things, wliich I had in my cell, but the Governor said, ' No, you must not stop. I will lock and seal up your cell if you like, and take care of your things, but out you go.' (Laughter.) Finding there was no train till two o'clock, I asked if I might not go to church. ' Outside if you like,' said the governor, ' not in here.' (Laughter.) I asked him what was the meaning of my discharge \u2014 was it a Queen's pardon I ' No,' he said, ' it is a complete remission \u2014 a blotting out \u2014 of the sentence.' (Cheers.) The chief warder told me it meant that my sentence was a -wrong one. (Cheers.) If it had been a Queen's pardon they could have put me out by force, but I would have gone out under protest, for I have done nothing to be pardoned for, and I do not regret a single act or word which can be laid to my charge. (Cheers.) In the thirteen clear days I spent in Maidstone Gaol I received 310 letters and I pp2"], [282, "592 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. answered 295. (Cheers and laughter.) I was treated very well in there, for I was ar first-class misdemeanant, and had a good many privileges. Though they convicted me they did not give hard labour. They would if they dared, but it shows that the Government was frightened of me. (Cheers.) .... I am more determined than ever to persevere in the cause I have undertaken, and so long as I have life the encroachers\u2014 I will call them what I have done before\u2014 the land thieves of Plum stead\u2014(cheers)\u2014shall not deter me, nor shall any power in the world alter my opinion. .... I want you to show the Government that you can hold a peaceful demonstra tion. (Hear, hear.) Let there be no stone-throwing, no fireworks, no ill word, no rioting. There are two strong divisions of police gone up on to the Common, but if you keep order they will not interfere with you. I ask all in this meeting who will obey me to hold up their hands. (A perfect forest of hands ascended.) If you have confidence in me, in Parliamentary language say ' Aye.' \" (A great shout of \" Aye\" arose.) Then Mr. Kimber, solicitor, spoke, and Dr. Baxter Langley was addressing the assembly when I made my way out of my corner in the gateway. The advent of \"the guys \"hail ten minutes later drawn off all interest in the speeches, and the speakers, therefore, climbed back over the roof and in at the window. An open carriage and four grey horses with postilions arrived about the same time to serve as the conquering hero's triumphal car. While the procession was forming, I strolled quietly away in tbe direction of Plumstead Common, diverting myself and testing the efficacy of my disguise by frequent converse in a feigned tongue with intimate daily acquaintances, not one of whom recognised me or had a doubt as to my genuine appearance. The sensation of speaking face to face with the friend of your bosom, whose features, instead of the usual smile of interest, wear a blank indifference which you have never seen before, is an experience remarkable and interesting, as well as novel. The private opinions enunciated in some of these interviews were also of interest. Most of the people were there out for curiosity, many of them, like myself, disguised, though not so carefully, nor for such good reason. The windows along the line of route, though darkened within, were full of spectators, and the event was of peculiar and delightful excitement for the children. I was posted near one group as the procession passed, and heard a little voice exclaim, \"Isn't it pretty? what is it for, mama ? \" \" They are going to bum your father, dear, but it won't hurt him.\" \" Ohr how nice, mama ! I wish they would do it every day ! \" The procession really was a very effective one, and, considering its object, and the class of people who took part in it, a creditable one. The whole street was a moving mass of people, in the midst of which the limits of the regular column were marked by a double line of torch-bearers, about fifty in number. Foremost came a cart, the occupants of which were all well-known costermongers from the lower part of Woolwich, surrounded and followed by their kindred and familiars. Next, another cart, contents of which were undiscoverable, and then someone mounted, but not very high \u2014 he was either on a donkey or a small pony. Then there was a band, and then De 51 organ ! He stood on his feet the whole distance, bowing and smiling right and left hke a real M.P. ; it was an ovation in the fullest sense, and, whatever the people may think of it hereafter, De Morgan ought to be a proud and happy man. Seated in his carriage were Messrs. Baxter Langley and Kimber, and the members of bis committee were in close attendance on their chief. Some distance behind came another band, and then the guys ! Having promised to assist in the iconoclasm which was to follow, and being ex ceedingly anxious, from a personal as well as professional view, to be in at the death, I hurried to the front, and, by a very easy method, found myself marching close behind the music, with a broomstick-torch in my hand, just as we reached Plumstead Common.

We were halted in front of Ebenezer Terrace, and we thought we were going to bum the effigies down in the broad sandpits opposite the house of Mr. Hughes, which would have been a capital spot, with good accommodation round the banks for all the thirty thousand people who had been by this time gathered. But the halt was only to relieve and refresh us with another groan, and we marched on, orderly as before, and I must say that although there was a good deal of strong language .amongst us, and a determined spirit which boded ill for any spy we might have discovered in our vicinity, we were a very orderly and good-humoured mob. Most of us thought it a \"jolly lark,\" and, in a conversation with one of the committee when the band took breath, he was good enough to agree with me that after this was over we would let our adversaries alone \u2014 \" though, mind you,\" he said, \" some of the blokes is bitter.\" The scene of execution was, for some mysterious cause, the very worst that could have been selected, being in the centre of the plateau on this side of the Slade, where the ground has been cut up by the troops into a dreadful swamp. Here the gibbet had been erected and the funeral pile prepared. The great doUs were brought under the affair\u2014 which was only a clothes-prop laid across two erect ones, like a rickety gymnastic cross-bar\u2014 and then the Commoners of Plumstead, as represented by the costermongers and coal-heavers from Woolwich, and some of the more youth- ful of the Royal Arsenal labourers, proceeded in high glee to the sacrifice. The figures were soon suspended, amid continuous laughter at the grotesque spectacle, and I had the extreme pleasure of making myself exceedingly useful at this interesting moment. The order to light the fire w-as promptly obeyed, and it burnt merrily ; but the wind drove the smoke and flames away from the effigies, and nearly suffocated some of the committee who were to leeward. Not wishing to prolong the situation, or delay the destruction of the coats and trousers, I assisted with the handle of my torch to arrange the burning embers so as more effectually to promote that object, and the stuffed guys were speedily ignited, though they burnt but slowly. Then I gave the fire a stir with my extinct torch, and had the satisfaction of seeing the ill-stuffed effigy in which I had the predominating interest dissolved into its component gases, except some fragments of old clothes which I poked away into the warmest places. The better-prepared companion- model was longer a-burning, but at length, with a swinging motion, which looked hke a graceful bow, the figure, its features wearing their accustomed calm under the most trying circumstances, disappeared from the view of the throng. Some fireworks had burst it, and we saw it consumed before we turned away. I was sorry to leave good company, but had no difficulty in evading the crowd ; and, throwing my torch stick over a hedge, I hurried down to the telegraph office at Woolwich, where I wrote a message which the clerk, who had been watching me suspiciously, read with considerable astonishment. Peace once more. \u2014 The great demonstration was happily the beginning of peace. There were a few more meetings, and when the Sth of November came round again there was some attempt to repeat the display, in which certain other individuals, who had rather sought the distinction, were \" effigied ; \" but the Metropolitan Board had just decided to purchase the Common and Bostall Heath for \u00a316,000, and some other things had happened which took the spirit out ofthe affair.

Lost in Snow. \u2014 The least regrettable of the enclosures upon the Common are those which were made for the Central Schools and the Slade Schools, two institutions which, prior to the advent of the Board Schools, came as blessings to the gathering population of Plumstead. A sad event stands out among the early recollections of the Slade Schools. On the 23rd of January, 1865, a little boy, named George Dednian, a month less than four years old, left the school to return home, and disappeared. Search was made in all directions, but the snow which was falling hid all such traces as there might have been, and it lay thick upon the ground for thirteen days. Then, on February 3rd, it removed its mantle, and the lifeless body of the poor child was dis- covered under a hedge at Clock Farm, Shooters' Hill. It is supposed that he wandered down Swingate Lane and so into the woods and fields. Poor-Law Unions. \u2014 Plumstead and Charlton were included in the Lewisham Union at its formation in 1836, being thus associated with Lee, Lewisham, Kidbrook, Eltham and Mottingham. The following was the return of indoor and outdoor relief for the quarter ending June, 1838 : \u2014 \u25a0 In 1868, Plumstead, Charlton, ancl Kidbrook were separated from Lewisham and joined to the Woolwich Union, in the references to which they will be found associated at page 113.

A Canal Projected. \u2014 It is, however, a matter of regret, in a commercial sense, that our predecessors did not preserve the stream which once penetrated from the river to Wickham, or that a canal had not been made before it was too late. There is in the British Museum a plan printed in 1812 on the survey of \" Joseph Steevens, Tower Royal,\" for a cutting described as the \" Royal Clarence Canal \" proposed to be carried in a straight line through Plumstead Marshes, entering just below the Arsenal and emerging north of Erith Church, where a large basin and dock were to be constructed. The plan, which is reproduced on page 552, does not appear to have been approved by Parliament. No Water-way. \u2014 But a parish which has a river frontage extending for miles and no means of access whatever to the water has a chronic grievance.

As the invert of the main sewer, which is 11| feet in diameter, is 28 feet below high water, the whole of the sewage has to be raised, and stored in a reservoir of 6^ acres and 14j feet deep. It is divided into four compartments, and the level of the floor is a little below the level of the land outside the works. The engine and boiler house form a substantial and handsome building and the engines are very massive. They are four in number, and each is of 125 nominal horse-power, with double that amount indicated, and each, working at 11 revolutions, raises 4,257 gallons per minute. Extensive additions to the reservoirs are now being made. The out-fall works are generally supposed to be in the Plumstead marshes, but they are actually in the parish of Erith, having been purposely placed beyond the boundary of the metropolitan district, which is at the Harrow Manorway, Abbey Wood.

It is eighteen minutes to seven, and the day is Saturday, October lst, 1864. Looking from my window at Eleanor Road, across the Royal Arsenal towards the east, I see a great column of black smoke ascending until it seems to flatten against the firmament in mushroom shape, and cower above the marshes like a hideous monster. That cloud was all that remained of two magazines of gunpowder measured by hundreds upon hundreds of tons. How much there was of it no one could tell, but it was certain that a quantity so enormous had never before been at one time fired, and never were the consequences of an explosion so widespread and fearful.* This know- ledge did not come at first sight, for, like the agonized people whom I found rushing about the streets, I concluded that the calamity had happened in the Royal Arsenal, and I hurried thither to trace the source. On all sides the effects were terribly visible. Broken win- dows, torn shutters, and such-like proofs showed everywhere the path of the concussive wave which had passed over Woolwich, and presently showers of scorched paper descended, some of which bore the name of \"Hall & Son,\" and we knew from these messengers that the Erith marshes was the spot at which we must ask for more information. A down train was due at the Arsenal station, and I with others soon reached Belvedere, whence a brisk run across the fields, strewed with bricks and debris, brought us on the scene of the disaster about half-an-hour after its occurrence. Early on the Spot. \u2014 There were only some twenty people yet arrived, and among them were two or three medical men mercifully engaged in attending to the poor wounded creatures who lay scattered about among the general ruin. Ruin ! It was annihilation ! Of the two great magazines which had stood by the river bank not one stone or brick remained upon another. Tbe jetties which had led from their doors over the river shore had disappeared as completely as if they had never existed, and the powder barges alongside had been * The daring attempt to destroy Fort Fisher during the American Civil War was suggested by this disaster. General Butler (Mr. Howard Paul tells us) had read in the English newspapers of the earthquake-like shock produced along the Thames by the explosion of gunpowder in the Plumstead magazines, the concussion of which was distinctly felt at a distance of fifty miles from Plumstead. The idea struck him that by exploding a powder-ship at midnight under Fort Fisher, he could blow down the cliff or bluff wliich supported the fort, and carry terror into the hearts of the survivors among its garrison. With great secrecy General Butler caused a propeller of 300 tons burden, called the Louisiana, to be loaded with 430,000 pounds of powder, placed in barrels with their upper ends open, and the remainder in ba^s carrying about 60 pounds apiece. The explosion took place shortly after midnight\u2014 that is to say, m the early morn of Christmas Day, 1864. The \"shock was terrific, but no damage was sustained by the earthworks ; only one man was killed and about thirty were wounded. It was believed that only a small portion of the powder had caudit fire. \u00b0"], [291, "601 ERITH blown to atoms. Of tbe two magazines the larger belonged to Messrs. Hall & Son, of Faversham, and had two floors used solely for the storage of gunpowder. The storekeeper in charge was Mr. George Raynor. The other magazine was the property of Messrs. Daye & Barker, otherwise the Lowood Company, and was under the direction of Mr. Walter Silver. The Victims. \u2014 Raynor and iSilver and various workmen resided with their families in cottages about a hundred and fifty yards from the magazines. Tbe body of Raynor was found lying near the place where his house had stood, for a bit of the wall and a door-frame alone remained. Poor creatures lay groaning and dying on all sides, while others had been blown into fragments which scattered the field. The number of the dead was reckoned to be eleven, and there were fifteen seriously injured. The former consisted of Raynor and two magazine men, named Yorke and Wright, Yorke's son John, aged thirteen, and Wright's daughter Elizabeth, also thirteen, two workmen, named Hubbard and Eves, employed in repairing the river bank, and four men belonging to the barges which had been lying at Hall's Wharf. Of the bargemen no trace which could be identified was ever found. A few limbs and other morsels were picked up far and near, and a ghastly collection of these dreadful relics were placed beside the bodies of the dead at the Belvedere Hotel. The wounded were surgically treated as they lay, and were as soon as practicable conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where one or two afterwards expired. Mr. Silver had a miraculous escape, being buried in the ruins of his house. The Cause. \u2014 How the calamity came to pass was never ascertained, although there was an inquiry extending over several weeks. It is believed, however, that the two barges were delivering powder from Faversham Mills at Hall's Magazine, and that it was on one of them or on the jetty that the fatal spark originated. Some of the witnesses stated that there were three distinct explosions \u2014 the second being the most tremendous. I heard only two reports, but I was not quite awake. Supposing that the barges went first, it is probable that the concussion shook down Hall's building and the burnt embers fired the powder, the greater explosion thus created igniting the Lowood magazine. A New Peril. \u2014 After the explosion came another danger. The river wall or bank had been blown away, and there was a yawning gap of one hundred yards in the barrier which guards the marshes from the Thames. Fortunately the tide was at its lowest ebb, but in four hours it would rise high enough to pour in, and, if unchecked, would flood all the low-lying parts of Erith and Plumstead. Another favourable circumstance was the presence within hail of considerable help. Mr."], [292, "602 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DLSTRICT.

LESNESS AND ERITH. Neighbours. \u2014 Plumstead, being large and widespread, with a breadth of five miles, comes in contact on the land side (not to mention its river borders) with five other parishes, namely, Woolwich, Eltham, East Wickham, Bexley, and Erith, and very nearly touches the only other places which go to form the Woolwich district \u2014 Charlton and Kidbrook. These contiguous parishes are, in consequence of their con nection one with another, all embraced within the province of these Records. With Erith the boundary of Plumstead keeps company from No. 2 Powder Magazine at the river bank, along the Harrow Manor way across the Marsh, and up Knee Hill to the junction of both parishes with Bexley at Bostall Heath. Abbey Wood. \u2014 The Abbey Wood portion of our story is dealt with under tbe head of Plumstead, from which I could not conveniently disassociate the history of the ancient Abbey,* Erith proper having been at the time of the Abbey's existence comparatively remote. Abbey Wood (West Wood) is mentioned in Domesday. Origin of Names. \u2014 The name of Erith is supposed by Lambarde to have been derived from the Saxon words \" arre hythe,\" or the old haven. \" Erith \" is also said to have been probably compounded of Abbey Wood, page 493."], [296, "604 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. \" ear,\" or spike of corn, and hythe, haven ; meaning the harbour for shipping corn, which is hardly so feasible as the other explanation. The whole parish at one time bore the name of \" Lesness.\" In certain ancient documents it appears to have been written \"Illiesnes.\" But this was probably a mere variation of Lesse-nesse or Lessness, the term applied to the manor of the aforesaid abbey, meaning simply the \"little nose\" of land which we now call \"Crossness Point.\" It is described in the Domesday Book (1086) as \" Loisnes,\" and the postal authorities in insisting as they do in classifying all the area hereabouts (\" Belvedere,\" \" Abbey Wood,\" \" Picardy,\" \" Beadonwell,\" &c.) under the generic title of \" Lesness,\" have good historical warrant. The name of Erith itself has been spelt in a variety of ways. Thus we have Aerre-hythe, Eareth, Erefe, Earhea, Earhith, Earithe, Earrife, Erehithe, Erith. Belvedere. \u2014 Belvedere takes its name, which is modern, from that of the still existent mansion, the origin of which was the French belveder, a turret or terrace. Until 185S Belvedere was always known by its more correct, but less poetic, name of Lessness, in which manor, as just stated, the whole parish was at one time embraced. Writers have puzzled over it many times, for it has been severally thus presented : Illiesnes, Leisnes, Lesens, Lesnes, Leswes, Leosne, Leosness, Liesnes, Liesenes, Lisnes, Loisnes, Lysness, Lessness, Lesness. (In Textus Roffensis \u2014 Lisna.) It has been suggested with some confidence that Lesness comes from the Saxon \"laes,\" a pasture land, but the interpretation which we see in the smaller of the two nesses which form the bay of Erith is to my mind much the more acceptable. However, \"lees\" (meadows) and \" nesse \" (a promontory) would well describe the physical features of the spot. \" Ness \" is often used in the same sense, as in Sheerness, Shellness, Blackness, ecc. The Manor. \u2014 The ecclesiastical affairs of this Manor of Lesness having been fully treated, it will be sufficient to say that William Tischerste, the last abbot, signed the instrument of resignation April lst, 1-525, and in the October following was instituted to the rectory of Horsemonden in the diocese of Rochester. Lesness Abbey, with the appurtenances, was, about the middle of the last century, settled by a Mr. Hawes on the Hospital of St. Bartholomew, London. The Manor of Erith. \u2014 The manor of Erith was at the time of the Domesday survey in the possession of Odo, Bishop of Baieux, but after his disgrace it reverted to the Crown. We next learn that in the reign of Henry II. Richard de Lucy was the owner of it. His son and grandson regularly inherited it, and after their death it devolved to Roisie de Lucy, who was married to Fulbert de Dover."], [297, "ERITH 605 Roisie, her granddaughter, married Richard, son of Robert de Chilham, and in the twelfth year of Henry III. she recovered possession of the manor from Robert Fitzwalter, as Hasted states it, on trial by battle. On her second marriage with Richard Fitzroy, the natural son of King John, the manor of Erith was assigned to her as a maintenance. She afterwards took a third husband, Richard de Dover, having paid a fine to the King for permission to marry whom she pleased. By this marriage she had a son and a daughter, the former of whom dying without issue, John, Earl of Athol, became the heir, and on the death of his widow, in the thirty-second year of Edward I., obtained possession of the manor. Two years later the King seized his estates, the Earl having been executed for assisting at the coronation of Robert Bruce of Scotland. Belvedere House in 1777. Erith was afterwards granted to Bartholomew de Badlesmere, who obtained licence to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs there as well as to have liberty of free warren. He was executed for high treason, but his estates were restored by Edward III. to his son Giles de Badlesmere, on whose death, in the twelfth year of that reign, they descended to his four sisters and co-heiresses, to one of whom Elizabeth, wife of Wilham de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, this manor was assigned on a partition, and on her death it descended to Roger, after wards Earl of March, her only surviving son by Edward de Mortimer, Q Q"], [298, "606 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. her first husband, whose descendants obtained the crown in the person of Edward IV. Henry VIII. granted Erith to Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, whose daughter Anne (by her first marriage the wife of Peter Compton, Esq., and by her second, the wife of William, Earl of Pembroke) died seized of this manor in the thirty-first year of Queen Elizabeth. Henry, Baron Compton, her only son by her first husband, succeeded, and settled Erith on Sir Thomas Compton, her second son who married Mary, Countess of Buckingham, relict of Sir George Villiers, but he, dying without issue, left it to Sir William Compton, a valiant officer in the service of Charles I. That gentleman disposed of it to Nicholas Vanacker, a merchant of London, from whose family it passed by the female line to Sir William Hodges, whose son bequeathed it at his death in 1734 to John Wheatley, Esq. Erith Church. \u2014 The church is an ancient structure of venerable simplicity. It contains an alabaster tomb to the memory of Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, who is represented in her robes and coronet, lying on a mat, with her head on a cushion and a hon at her feet. On the sides of the tomb are various shields of arms, with numerous quarter - ings, displaying the intermarriages and alliances of the family. The inscription is obliterated, but has been preserved by Weever, who, as we have seen, was the rector of the parish in the reign of James I. There is also an interesting inscription that perpetuates the sepulture of Rogerius Sender, who was a servant in the Abbey. The record states that he died on New Year's Day, 1421. Magna Charta. \u2014 The church is chiefly celebrated as being the place where a treaty was discussed, in the seventeenth year of Kino- John between several Commissioners appointed by his Majesty, and Richard, Earl of Clare, and others on behalf of the discontented barons respectino a peace between the King and them, and for which purpose the latter had a safe-conduct, dated 9th November in that year. We may imagine, if we like, that here was drawn the first rough draft of Magna Charta. A Venerable Record. \u2014 There is another, and much older, record of Erith, dated almost a century before the Conquest, when England was under Saxon law. A certain rich man, Anno 970, being owner of Cray, Erith, Ainesford, and Woldham, and having no issue, devised the same lands by his will, in the presence of Dunstan and others, to a kinswoman of his own for life, the remainder after her death to be divided ecpially between Christ Church, Canterbury, and St. Andrew's Rochester. But his widow married one Loefsun, who outlived her and retained the land where upon complaint was made to Wulsic, the \" scyreman,\" or county judge, before whom Archbishop Dunstan and the other parties to the suit, with a great multitude of"], [299, "607 ERITH people, assembled at Erith, when the archbishop, taking a cross in his hand, made \" a corporal oath upon the Book of Ecclesiastical Laws,\" a thousand other persons taking their oaths also upon the cross after him. And in the judgment the two churches were brought into possession and the wicked Loefsun discomfited. The earliest mention of Erith, according to Archdeacon Smith, is in a charter for granting forty pieces of land and a dwelling-house on each plot, in the parishes of Swanscombe and Erith dated a.d. 695. Mayor Of Erith. \u2014 Erith appears to have been once a corporate town, with a mayor, and no other town west of it had the like honour until we reach London. The authority is an odd old book called \"Lawyers' Logik,\" published in 1588, and it says, \"The mayre of Erith is the best mayre next to the mayre of London, and the very next to London, because there is none between.\" From what sove reign Erith obtained this privilege, and how Erith lost it, history saith not. Old Names. \u2014 Picardy, in the parish of Erith, may have some con nection with the Thomas Pycard, yeoman, of Erehithe, who was among the pardoned rebels in the Jack Cade rebellion. In the same list are Edmund atte Wode, yeoman, of Erehithe, and Thomas Jonson, Richard Jonson, Roger Ridley, John Hychcok, and John Bolton, all of Ere hithe.

This to acquaint the Public, that on Whit-Monday, and during the holidays, the under-mentioned diversions will take place.

Belvedere Park.\u2014 Belvedere Park, including tbe house which is now an asylum for sailors, was once the seat of Lord Saye and Sele. The first mansion was built by a gentleman named Hayley, who, after a residence of some years, sold it to Lord Baltimore. This nobleman Belvedere Hospital for Seamen, 1868, died here on 24th April, 1751, and soon after the estate was bought by a gentleman named Gideon, whose son was created Lord Eardley in 1790. The house is situated about a mile from the river and the same distance between Erith and Lesness Abbey. It is a spacious, brick mansion, which was rebuilt towards the close of the last century by its then possessor, Lord Eardley, but retains an elegant drawing-room of the former edifice. On the death of Lord Saye and Sele about 1845 the property reverted to Sir Culling Eardley Smith, who then assumed the name of Eardley ; at his death in 1860 it passed to his son, who soon lost it. It was then purchased by Lieutenant Lean, R.N., for a hospi tal for decayed merchant seamen."], [301, "609 ERITH, Erith as a Royal Dockyard. \u2014 -Although the discovery of a record in the Rolls House settles in favour of Woolwich * the long-standing contention between that town and Erith to be regarded as the birthplace of the first great ship, the Great Harry, in 1515, there is good reason to believe that the vessel was \" hallowed \" by King Henry VIII. at Erith, where that monarch certainly established a royal dock, and was several times a visitor. The dock does not appear to have been used for the national service after the king's death, but some portions of it still remain west of the ballast wharf, which is opposite the end of the road leading to the railway station. Nonconformity at Erith. \u2014 A small Independent chapel was built at Erith in 1823, and for many years supplied by ministers from Woolwich and elsewhere, but about 1837 the Rev. John Simpson took charge and remained until 1842, when the Wesleyan association under- took the supply of ministers. About this time Sir Culling Eardley exerted his influence and sympathy for evangelical teaching and engaged at his own cost an agent of the city mission, besides erecting a school- house in connection with the chapel. In 1848 Sir Culling Eardley erected a commodious building in his park and adjoining his house, and it was dedicated to divine worship on July 12th in that year. The Rev. J. P. Dobson was engaged as minister of the \" Tower Church,\" as it was called, and he was succeeded by the Rev. E. Cornwall. The congregation were known as \" Independents,\" using a modified form of the Established liturgy, but opening the pulpit to all Christian denominations. Some very celebrated preachers, foreign as well as native,\" found a hearing in this place, and the church made remarkable progress. All Saints', Belvedere. \u2014 Sir Culling next erected \" All Saints' Church\" on the Heath beyond his park, and it was dedicated Oct. 20th, 1853, when the Rev. James Stratten and the Hon. and Rev. Baptist W. Noel both preached. The Rev. T. Gilfillan, formerly a missionary in China, was the first pastor, but in 1855 the vicar of the parish proposed that the church should be associated with the Establishment, which was accomplished on May 10th, 1856, by the Rev. H. Alford, Dean of Canterbury. The Independents. \u2014 The Independents thereupon turned their attention once more to the old chapel in the village of Erith, and thither the Rev. Chas. Gilbert, who had settled in Erith, transferred the energy and devotion which he had already displayed at Bexley, completely refitting the old edifice and reopening it on May 5th, 1857.

Wheatley, Lord of the Manor, the church and schools were built. Northumberland Heath Chapel. \u2014 Northumberland Heath Chapel is in the parish of Erith. A Sunday-school and prayer-meet ing was estabhshed here in 1855, and a city missionary was planted on the spot at the cost of two gentlemen. A chapel was erected and dedicated April 23rd, 1857. Houses and Population. \u2014 The 1881 census supplies the follow- ing figures relative to the parish of Erith* : \u2014 Area in Acres, 3,860. For a fuller description of this parish, I would refer to the works entitled \u2014 \" The Parish of Erith in Ancient and Modern Times,\" by John Harris, 1855. \" Erith : its Natural, Civil, and Ecclesiastical History,\" by the Rev. Archdeacon Smith, Vicar, published in 1873. Each is a volume perfect of its kind, and is so readily accessible as to render superfluous a more extended recital in this place. * See also page 628.

BEXLEY AND BEXLEY HEATH. Bexley Parish. \u2014 Bexley is a parish in the lathe of Sutton-at-Hone, hundred of Ruxley, Union and County Court district of Dartford, and diocese of Canterbury. Within the civil parish of Bexley are included Bexley New Town, commonly called Bexley Heath, and the villages of Blendon, Bridgen, Halfway Street, Hurst and Upton. The River Cray crosses the centre of the village of Bexley in its course to Crayford. The parish has largely increased in population during the last half century. In 1821 there were only four hundred houses and two thousand three hundred men, women, and children recorded in its census return, and there are now nearly nine thousand inhabitants. The population in 1881, including Bexley Heath and part of Welling, was 8,793.

It is not a large parish, being about three miles square, but it can boast of some of the loveliest scenery in Kent. Old Name. \u2014 Anciently the name was written Bekesley,* and was derived from Bee or Beke, a stream, and ley or lea, a pasture. It is called Bix in William the Conqueror's rate-book. A Marvellous Baby. \u2014 Among the records one of the earliest and most curious is that relating to the miraculously precocious St. Run wald, a Saxon saint. He was a son of the King of Northumbria, and his mother was daughter of the King of Mercia. As soon as he was born he exclaimed, \" I am a Christian,\" and chose his god-parents and his name. He celebrated his infant baptism by a learned and eloquent discourse on the articles of the faith which lasted for three days ! The remainder of this chapter will be truth. Lord Bexley. \u2014 For a brief period Bexley had its name in the peerage. The Right Hon. Nicholas Vansittart, the friend of Percival and Lord Liverpool, having held the Chancellorship of the Exchequer and other ministerial offices, was created \" Lord Bexley of Bexley, in the county of Kent,\" in 1823. His peerage became extinct on his death in 1851. Members of the family still hold property in the parish. Bexley Church. \u2014 The church, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, is very ancient, having existed on this spot prior to the advent of the Normans. Domesday Book mentions it as standing in the reign of Edward the Confessor, between 1041 and 1066, and the ecclesiastical documents show that still earlier, just after the con quest of Kent by Cenulph, King of Mercia, a church w7as erected here. We also learn that the manor of Bexley was given by Cenulph, as an appurtenance of the monastery at Canterbury, to Wilfred, who was archbishop from 803 until his death in 829. Between these dates Mr. Walrond thinks the first church was built at Bexley. The same authority supposes, from a finely moulded Norman archway over the early-English south door of the nave, that the Saxon structure was superseded by a Norman one, and, if so, there is reason to believe that the present walls were built in the eleventh century. The church, however, shows numerous signs of restoration and improvements in various ages, and no two windows are alike. The chief beauty of the interior is its screen, which has been carefully reconstructed of the original design. The edifice is a structure of flint, chiefly in the early- * A trade token is preserved bearing this inscription :\u2014 Obv.\u2014 John Thorndell in Becksley = an Ox and Axe. Rev.\u2014 In Kent.

The whole build ing was thoroughly restored in 1882-3 under the hand of Mr. B. Champ neys, at a cost of nearly \u00a34,000. The screen now supports a new organ, and both were the gift of Mr. John Flower Jackson, of Bourne House. In the early days the screen was crowned by the holy rood and the figures of the Virgin and St. John, as appears by the inventory taken by Henry VIII. Among the old carvings are the arms of the Lucy family, possibly from association with the monks of Lesness Abbey, of which the Lucys were the founders. Several old brasses long buried have also been brought to light, one being a memorial of Thomas Sparrow, 1583, inserted in an inscribed stone of much earlier date. His daughter appears to have carried the estate of Laniienby, now called Lamorbey (or Lamb Abbey), by marriage, into the Goldwell family. Monuments are erected to Mr. Oswald Smith of Blendon Hall, Sir John Champneys, Lord Mayor of London, who died in 155G, and the families of Sir Edward Brett, Austen, Hereworth, Huntington, Gerard, Brinton, Whitmore, Shelley, and Woolryche. The registers date from 1565. Five Times Wed. \u2014 There is a monument in the church to Mr. John Styleman, who died in 1734, after having been five times married. His wife Mary, who was three times a bride, died in 1750, and founded almshouses for twelve poor people. These almshouses are at the west end of High Street, and are endowed with a rent charge of \u00a3100 on the Danson Park Estate at Welling, where the founder resided. The New Church. \u2014 In 1882 a new church was consecrated at Parkwood for the use of the western end of the parish. It is well built in the Gothic style, and cost \u00a34,000. It is dedicated to St. John. Old Parsonage. \u2014 Opposite the upper gates of the churchyard once stood the timber-built parsonage, thought to be as old as the time of Edward IV. It was built of chestnut, and enclosed a square court with wicker gate. In its declining days it was the habitation of poor families, and, becoming ruinous, it was demolished in 1776. Manor-House. \u2014 The old manor-house adjoining the church was rebuilt about 1750 by John Thorpe, who purchased the property from the Austens of Hall Place. Camden, the celebrated antiquary and his torian, was formerly owner of this manor, and devised it with the house to the University of Oxford for the endowment of a professorship of ancient history."], [306, "G14 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Church Districts. \u2014 The ecclesiastical district of St. Mary the Virgin, Bexley, contained, in 1881, 429 inhabited houses, and 2,199 souls ; Christ Church district was formed in 1866, when its houses were 1,178, and the population 5,933 ; and Holy Trinity, Lamorbey, was formed in 1878, with 113 houses and 661 people. Charities. \u2014 There are several charities existing in this parish. The Charity Commissioners have issued a scheme for their management.

Many improvements have been carried out in the parish since the Board was established, notably, better roads, pavements, watering, and lighting.

Hall Place. \u2014 Hall Place, about half a mile north-eastward from the village of Bexley, on the road to Crayford, is a quaint old Tudor mansion belonging to the Dashwood family. It rises out of a lawn of the softest and greenest turf, and its grey stone walls and square mullioned windows tell at once of its hoary antiquity. The entrance corridor is enriched with a fine Jacobean staircase, with massive oaken balusters. Dene-holes.* \u2014 The following reference to the so-called \"dene holes,\" or chalk-holes, which abound in this part of Kent, with collateral notice of an old Bexley custom, appeared in Notes and Queries of May 20th, 1882 : \u2014 Speaking of the singular shafts, some of them a hundred feet deep, found in the chalk about Bexley and other places in Kent, and which are supposed to have been made by our neolithic ancestors in the quest for flints for their weapons, the Rev. J. G. Wood remarks : \u2014 \" At the bottom of each shaft is a globular chamber, so that the whole mine somewhat resembles an exaggerated claret-bottle without the handle. By a curious coincidence, the shape of the Bexley shafts is exactly that of a local beer measure which is held in great estimation. In several houses may be seen an advertisement that beer is sold by the yard.\" And so it is, in accordance with a local custom. There is a glass vessel exactly three feet in length, with a very narrow stem, slightly lipped at the mouth, and a globular bowl at the bottom exactly resembling the pit, the lipped mouth representing the conical entrance to the pit, and the bulb answering to the domed chamber. This is filled with beer, and any one who can drink it without spilling it may have it for nothing, but if he spills one drop he pays double. It looks so easy, and it is so difficult, not to say impossible, to a novice. You take the vessel iu both hands, apply the lip to your mouth, and then gently tilt it. At first the beer flows quietly and slowly, and you think how admirably you are overcoming the difficulty. Suddenly, when the vessel is tilted a little more, the air rushes up the stem into the bowl, and splashes about half a pint into your face. The cheapest plan is to treat the barman to a \" yard \" of beer, and see how he does it. * The term dene-hole, being in common employment, is adopted for convenience, but it is palpably a corruption from the original word Dane-hole. Mr. Roach Smith, whose opinion on the subject is to be regarded, writes as follows : \" In the sense of dene, as a den or pit, we can find no authority for the word. They have been called Dane-holes in the same sense as the word Dane is often applied, as Dane-field, from some vague notion of a connection with the Danes as scourgers of the land in olden times. Similar inexplicable objects to the ignorant are attributed to the devil. In some parts of Kent they are called lift-holes, or draw-holes, terms perfectly correct, for some are in use at the present day for drawing up chalk for manuring the land. This, we suggest, is the origin of the whole of them, and it is obviously impossible they could ever have been, as asserted by some, used for dwelling places or for the storing of corn.\" \u2014 Letter to G. 0. Howell, July, 1889. The error seems to have come down from a remote age. An early Roman writer (Diodorus Siculus), in speaking of the aboriginal tribes of Britain, says : \" They have mean habitations, constructed for the most part of reeds and of wood, and they gather in their harvest by cutting off the ears of corn and storing them in subterranean repositories.\" See also page 531."], [308, "616 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Nonconformity.\u2014 Freedom of worship has prevailed at Bexley from a very early period. In the early part of the last century the Rev. H. Piers, an Evangelical clergyman, was vicar of the parish, and was visited by the Rev. Charles Wesley in 1737. In consequence of this intimacy the Rev. Mr. Whitfield also visited Bexley and preached on Bexley Heath to three hundred persons on June Sth, 1739, preaching also at Bexley Church on the following day, as recorded in his journal : \u2014 jime 6th.\u2014 About ten in the morning read prayers and preached at Bexley Church ; Mr. P., the vicar, my brother and fellow-labourer in Christ, having given me a pressing invitation. The congreg.ation was large. The Rev. John Wesley also visited Mr. Piers at Bexley on Septem ber 22nd, 1740, and it is remarked in the \"Life and Times of Lady Huntington,\" that \"the Rev. Henry Piers, vicar of Bexley, an awakened clergyman,\" attended the first Methodist conference. Such dissenters as there were at this time attended the Independent Church at Dartford, or joined the Baptists at Crayford. Bexley Heath. \u2014 Bexley Heath is conspicuously situated on the high road from London to Dover (the ancient Watling Street), and is .about a mile and a quarter from Old Bexley, three miles from Dartford, and five miles south-east from Woolwich. Bexley Heath also touches Plumstead on the south-east, pushing in a promontory between East Wickham and Erith. The broad street of which it consists was once the open heath, but its character and appearance during the past thirty years has quite changed under the hands of the builder. Looking to the south, fine scenery extending over the valley of the Cray presents itself for many miles. In 1866 it was formed into a separate ecclesias tical district from the mother parish of Bexley. Christ Church (formerly a chapel of ease), the first church ofthe new district, was a brick building with a tall spire, approached by a fine avenue of lime-trees on the south side of the road , but it has been superseded by a much larger one, also called Christ Church, on the other side of the way. It was commenced in 1877, it has already cost about \u00a310,000, and when the north transept and spire are completed it will be one of the finest churches in Kent. The building, in the Gothic style, is of stone, and consists of a lofty nave, chancel, aisles, and south transept, with a choir vestry. The aisles contain twelve stained glass windows, presented by Mr. JohnEdensor, of Upton Lodge, three stained glass win dows in the chancel and the baptistery window in memoriam ofthe Rev. William Henry Pincott, the first vicar of the parish, and another to the memory of a late sidesman. The church has over 900 sittings. The living is a vicarage in the gift of Earl Sydney, and held by the Rev. Henry Lawrence Fry, M.A., of Trinity College, Dublin. Adjacent"], [309, "617 BEXLEY. to the church is the new cemetery, managed by a Burial Board of nine members. The population of this district numbers over 5,000. The First Chapel. \u2014 It was not until 1850 that Bexley Heath Congregational Chapel came into being. The Baptists had, however, been'established since 1826. It was in 1850 that the Rev. C. Gilbert, of Islington, while on a visit, engaged the building known as \"The Athen\u00e6um,\" fitted it up as a chapel, and, aided by the Independent Ministers of Woolwich and other places, opened the place for worship on January 15th, 1851. Supplies were provided until the following October, when the Rev. W. R. Noble was appointed pastor of the church, which was fully organized on November 19th, Messrs. Lane and Sanderson being appointed deacons. So successful was the work that in October 19th, 1853, the foundation of the new church was laid and the building was opened on June 14th, 1854. Mr. Noble, for the sake of his health, resigned the pastorate, and removed to Plymouth, November 23rd, 1854, and the Rev. James Barfitt, from Plymouth, succeeded him on December 4th, 1854. He resigned June 30th, 1856, and for the next six months there was no regular minister, but on November 27th, the Rev. Charles Gilbert, secretary of tbe London Congregational Chapel Building Society, undertook tbe pastorate for one year, and succeeded in reducing a heavy debt of \u00a31,800 to \u00a3270. Mr. Gilbert then removed to Erith, and was followed by the Rev. John Adey, of Union Chapel, Southwark, on February 7th, 1858, who was succeeded by the Rev. James Geddes, the present pastor. Modern Buildings. \u2014 Within the district \"of Bexley Heath is a public hall, built in 1870, at a cost of \u00a32,000, for concerts, public meet ings, &c. It is a Gothic brick building and capable of seating 500. A pretty cottage hospital has recently been erected in the Upton Road, on a site given by Mr. A. W. Bean, of Danson Park. The Foresters have an asylum here, erected in 1872, for sixteen pen sioners, who are allowed 6s. per week with firing. A fountain of granite, in the form of an obelisk, with a drinking trough for cattle, erected to the memory of the Rev. W. H. Pincott, by public subscription, forms a prominent object in the centre of the Market Place. Market Gardens. \u2014 Here, on high ground (says Mr. Walrond), we come upon the market gardens. Strawberries, raspberries, and tomatoes, are the chief production of this district, which supplies a large part of the demands of Covent Garden with fruit, vegetables, and flowers. One grower in this neighbourhood, Mr. Ladds, has upwards of five miles of glasshouses, under which be raises tons of tomatoes and strawberries for the London market ; he has also at Dartford Heath"], [310, "618 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. about fifteen acres of garden, where tomatoes are grown hke hops. The outlying portions of the estate of the Dashwoods, of Hall Place, comprise large fields of strawberries and raspberries, and the picking season brings down from London hordes of families, each member of which can earn about eighteenpence a day. Blendon. \u2014 Blendon Hall stands in the hamlet of Bridgen, about mid-way between Sidcup and the village of Bexley. It was anciently in the possession of Jordan de Bladigdone, a name which in process of time became corrupted into Blendon. In the reign of Richard II. the estate was conveyed to the Walsinghams, with which family it con tinued till the close of the reign of Henry IV. In the time of Charles I. the estate was held by the family of Sir John Wroth, Bart., and later on it passed to the Bretts. Blendon Hall subsequently under went several changes of ownership, and about ten years ago it was purchased by Mr. W. Cunliffe Pickersgill. Near Blendon Hall is another seat, called Bridgen Place, the residence of Mrs. Arbuthnot."], [311, "East Wickham Church, 1790. CHAPTER XLIX. EAST WICKHAM AND WELLING Kent next London. \u2014 Anywhere beyond the parish of Plum stead we are over the border of the Metropolitan district and out of the jurisdiction of the London Council. We are clear also of the town, and in the midst of the country. The scenery at once becomes charac teristic of the \" garden of England,\" for the richly cultivated land and pastures, the flowing undulations and the plenitude of trees which we meet at East Wickham, are to be found wherever we go throughout the beautiful county of Kent. But the county is not only supreme in its picturesque attributes, for it has, by reason of its position, played an early and pre-eminent part in our national history. Gavel-kind. \u2014 In evidence of this I have already quoted the law of gavel-kind.* This system, which is almost peculiar to Kent, is clearly a survival of the old Saxon law, by which the lands of the father were at his death equally divided amongst his sons, or the land of a brother amongst his brethren, if he had no issue. f This was the tenure of all lands in England prior to the Conquest, at which knight's * Page 9. t Sir William Lambarde conjectured that the term gavel-kind may have been derived from give-all-kyn or give-all-kynd \u2014 kynd in Dutch signifying a male child."], [312, "620 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. service superseded the Saxon sj-stem of heritage, and the descent was restrained to the eldest son. From this change, we are told, Kent was exempted by the courage and tact of her yeomen, who surrounded the invaders with a moving wood of green boughs and obtained from the Conqueror a concession of their ancient privileges.* Hence the old rhyme \u2014 When counties round, with fear profound, To mend their sad condition, Their lands to save base homage gave, Bold Kent made no submission. The hardy stout freeholders That knew the Tyrant near In girdles and on shoulders A grove of oaks did bear. Whom when he saw in battle draw And thought how he might need'em He turned his arms, allowed their terms, Replete with noble freedom. The promised land of blessing (For our forefathers meant), Is now in sight possessing For Canaan sure was Kent. Hear, also, Thomas Hughes : \u2014 The Norman William knew their lofty claim, Nor dared to check the current of their flame, Signed all their Saxon charters with content, And fix'd a friendship with the men of Kent, Confirmed their charters, for full well he knew Their spirits noble and their friendship true, \u2014 Customs resulting from the deepest thought, Upheld by justice, and by virtue taught, That if for crime the father bent the bough, The guiltless son should hold his land and plough ;f But best, a balm to soothe the sorrowing mind, The orphans' firm support, blest Gavelkind ! The traditional privilege, whatever its origin, has always been held in favour by the people of Kent, and, notwithstanding some incon veniences, it is still the general law throughout the county. By this law of gavel-kind \u2014 (1) A tenant can alienate (or dispose of) land by feoffment (granting possession) at the age of 15. * The scene of this exploit is laid at Swanscombe, but the legend is unsupported. Ine green branches look hke conciliation rather than defiance. t Alluding to Ihe county proverb \u2014 The father to the boughe, The son to the ploughe."], [313, "EAST WICKHAM AND WELLING. 621 (2) A tenant can alienate land in escheat (forfeit to the lord of the manor), or on attainder for felony. (3) A tenant can dispose of land by will. (4) In case of intestacy, the estate descends, not to the eldest son, as by common law, but to all the sons in equal shares.* Most persons neutralise the last of these conditions by making their wills, but the law is almost universal in Kent. I have, however, the assurance of one of the best living authorities for saying that much of the land in Kent, probably two-thirds, has at some time or other been held by knight's service and not gavel-kind, and it is certain that various acts of Parliament have been passed to override tbe custom in particular cases. But the mere presumption that the system applies to all Kent has caused vast quantities of land to be treated as gavel- kind which ought really to be exempt, for the task of identifying the knight service land has been impossible to accomplish, and in many instances, after the owners have taken the trouble to disgavel by statute, the lands have been suffered to fall back again upon the old prescriptive law. In the reign of Edward VI. a return was made, which showed that there were only forty persons in the county who held property other than by gavel-kind, and at the present time there is very little of the soil of Kent to which the custom does not extend. From many inquiries which I have made I am disposed to say that there is no disgaveled land whatever in the Woolwich district. Wealth. \u2014 The county of Kent, from the position which it occupies in relation to the continent of Europe, has always been held of the highest importance in English history, and it is, moreover, as it has been from immemorial time, the wealthiest county of the kingdom. An ancient rhyme declares that \u2014 A Knight of Cales, t a gentleman of Wales, And a laird of the north countree ; A yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent, Will buy them out all three. The poet Drayton also speaks rapturously of this county Oh famous Kent ! What county hath this Isle that can compare with thee ! Thou hast within thyself as much as thou canst wish \u2014 Thy wines, venison, fruit, thy sorts of fowl and fish : As what with strength comports, thy hay, thy corn, thy wood, Nor anything doth want that anywhere is good.

It is of small extent, covering but seven hundred acres, principally arable and woodland. It extends about a mile south of the Dover Road, on which it is eleven miles from London. The soil is chiefly gravel, in some parts clay. It has lost little of its agricultural features under the outward expansion of London, and it needs only a railway station to become a favourite residence. In 1795, according to Lysons, the parish paid \u00a377 to the land tax at the rate of about two shillings in the pound. It contained only thirty-four houses. The reader may refer to the old and interesting plan of the Plumstead Manor at page 520, for the condition of East Wickham in 1720. The principal residence at that time appears to have been the Mansion of Sir John Leigh, just south of the church, and Sir John figures as the chief landowner. In 1795 this house had disappeared,\"- and we read only of East Wickham House, then (and now) occupied by the family of Jones.

From him they descended, with the estates in Eastham and Westham, to the families of Handlo and Lovell. * Its foundations were uncovered some years since, and are still conspicuous in tlie held or orchard south of the church, occupying a lar^e space t The sign of the \"Fighting Cocks\" at East Wickham is mentioned iu the manor s of 1 1 71 and also in 1829."], [315, "623 EAST WICKHAM AND WELLING. William Lord Lovell died seized of the manor in 1455. On the death of his son, Francis Viscount Lovell, who was slain in battle, 1488, it was inherited by Henry Lovell, Lord Morley, and on his decease in 1490, it escheated to the Crown. Henry VIII. granted it in 1512 to Sir John Petche for sixty years, and, in 1514, gave the reversion to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, whose great-grandson, in 1562, conveyed it to Richard Carell and John Hutchinson, who, by his direction, aliened it to John Olyffe, Esq., Alderman of London. Mr. Olyffe's daughter and sole heir married John Leigh, Esq., of Addington, in the county of Surrey, in whose family this manor continued till the death of Sir John Leigh in 1737, when a suit in Chancery commenced relative to the inheritance of his estates which, in 1742, was determined in favour of Mary, wife of Joint Bennett, Esq. and Anne, wife of Henry Spencer, Esq., daughters <pf Wooley Leigh, Esq., younger brother of the deceased. The decree was confirmed by an Act of Parliament. In 1767, a division ofthe estates took place, when this manor was allotted to the Bennett family, and is now (1795) the property of the Rev. John Bennett. The old manor house, which was for some time the residence of the Leighs, has been pulled down. Hamlet of Welling. \u2014 Mr. Lysons continues to say that \u2014 At Welling, a hamlet on the road to Dover (partly in this parish), is a house which was for merly the seat of the Denhams. The houses on the south side of the road, nearly twenty in num \"ber, are in East Wickham, those on the north side ofthe road in Bexley. The Rev. Thomas Cookes, who married Anne, only daughter and heir of John Denham, Esq., sold it to Mr. Benjamin Hinkworth. In the village of Wickham is the seat of the late Richard Jones, Esq., now (1795) in the occupation of his widow. The Supplement to Lysons' \" Envi rons \" published in 1811 adds : \u2014 The Rev. John Leigh Bennett is proprietor of the manor. The house, which is occupied by the family of Jones, was some time the residence of Sir J. Eardley Wilniot, Chief Justice of the Com mon Pleas. Ancient Brass in Wickham Church The Church. \u2014 We may still quote Lysons as to the church, for ninety years has not changed it greatly. He says :\u2014 The parish church, dedicated to St. Michael, is a small ancient structure of flint and stone, consisting of chancel and nave. At the west end is a small turret and a wooden spire. The font is octagonal, ornamented with quatrefoils. On the floor of the chancel is a brass plate (with small half-length figures) in memory of John de K E 2"], [316, "624 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Bladigdone, and Maud, his wife.* Some brass plates in memory of Wilham Payne, Yeoman of the Guard, 1568, and his three wives, Elizabeth, Joan, and Joan, have lately been covered with a pew. On the fourth wall of the nave is a monument in memory of Catherine, daughter of John Barton, Sergeant at Law, wife, first of John Leigh, Esq., of Addington ; secondly, of William Walsham, Esq., ofthe Inner Temple. She died in 1715, and her second husband, William Walsham, in 1728. t In the churchyard are the tombs of Henry Kipling, Esq., 1780, and Mary, daughter and heir of Christopher Skegness, by Mary, daughter of Tooley, 1790. The illustration of East Wickham Church, given at page 619, is from a MS. sketch drawn in 1790. Within the last few years the church yard has been enlarged and some other improvements effected. Parish School. \u2014 Mr. William Foster, of Croydon, in the year 1728, founded a school at this place for the education of twenty poor children of East Wickham and Welling, endowing it with some lands at Croydon, worth, in 1790, about \u00a320 per annum, as a salary for the master. The value of his endowment has greatly increased. In 1811, it was \u00a342 a year, and it now amounts to \u00a3247. The present schools, with residence for master, were erected in 1879 for 400 children, not far from the old building, still standing, in Wickham Lane. Anonymous Charity. \u2014 Some cottages at Welling (situated within the adjoining parish of Bexley), let in Mr. Lysons' time at \u00a311 per annum, were given to the poor of East Wickham by a benefactor now unknown. * In 1887, the ancient brass of Johan de Bladigdone, and Maud, his wife, hi East Wickham Church, was restored by a subscription as shown on the previous page. The brass consists of two half-length figures, male and female, within a handsome floriated cross, on the long shaft of which remains part of the inscription, in Nor- man French: ''Johan de Bladigdone et Maud sa feme.\" The word \" feme,\" being missing, had to be supplied. The continuation of the inscription, together with half the shaft and base of the cross, have long disappeared. The brass is very old ; the date is probably 1325, and it is believed to be the oldest example extant of a male figure clad in civil costume. From a drawing made of it in 1809, the brass appears to have undergone little change in the interval, except that three finials of the cross are missing; but, at some time since 1809, the brass became detached from the stone and was placed in the drawer of a table in the vestry. When, subsequently, the church was broken into by thieves, the cross was used by the burglars to prise open a cup- board, and was thus broken into several pieces, all of which were found and preserved. The grave which it honoured is in the aisle at the entrance to the chancel, and it was fixed in the flagstone cover. This stone being chipped and rotten and underfoot, it was decided at the restoration to insert the brass in a new Portland slab, and fix it on the south wall opposite the grave, with the inscription, \" Restored, 50 Victoria R., 1887.\" Johan de Bladigdone (or Blendon) is believed to have rebuilt the church, the architecture of which is about his assumed date. The church which preceded it was probably Saxon, and of wood. The last resident member of the family was Jordan de Bladigdone, who sold Blendon to the Walsingham family towards the end of Richard II.'s reign (1399). The old house is said to be the same as was afterwards occupied by the Leighs, a little south of the church. t A three-light memorial window was erected in 1888 by the family of Mr. John Thomas, of Bellegrove, and Sarah Elizabeth, his wife, in memory of their parents, whose tomb is in Woolwich Cemetery."], [317, "625 EAST WICKHAM AND WELLING. The Name of Wickham. \u2014 Wickham probably signifies \"the home place ; \" trie meaning indifferently a dwelling, a castle, a road, &c.,* and ham standing literally for home. There is, however, a Wick ham in the West of England, which a highly imaginative writer has interpreted meg, Anglo-Saxon for \"horse,\" and ham, \"a home :\" i.e. a home for horses ! Well-end. \u2014 Welling is called \" Well- end \" in all the old maps, and is supposed to have derived the name from the satisfaction of travellers who had here completed half the journey between London and Gravesend. Hasted, the Kentish historian, says : \" It was called Well-End from the safe arrival of the traveller at it after having escaped the danger of robbers through the hazardous road from Shooters' Hill.\" \" Rather, perhaps,\" observes Mr. James Thorne, in his \" En virons of London,\" \"from half the dangerous way having been passed, as Bexley Heath must have been nearly as hazardous as Shooters' Hill.\" Danson, Welling, by Corbauld, 1794. Mr. Walrond, in his \" Greater London,\" says that \"Welling con sists of a few small shops, one or two good roadside inns, and the usual heterogeneous assortment of dweUings \u2014 good, bad, and indifferent \u2014 which go to make up a roadside village.\" Towards the western end ofthe village is a small temporary iron church, erected in 1869 at the expense of Mr. Alfred W.

It was erected about the year 1770 by Sir John Boyd, Bart., who then owned the estate, from the designs of Sir Robert Taylor. The park is pleasantly undulating, well timbered, and has a large lake towards its southern extremity. Under the heading of Bexley, in Hughson's \" London,\" published in 1808, we find the following description of Danson : \u2014 Among the seats in this parish the principal is Danson Hill, lately the seat of Sir John Boyd, Bart. It was originally the property of Archbishop Parker, and, after various owners, came into the possession of John Boyd, Esq., merchant, of London, who erected the present mansion from designs of the late Sir Robert Taylor, though these were departed from in the course of building. The principal floor contains large and elegant apartments, and the grounds are laid out in a masterly manner by Capability Browne, who also formed a fine sheet of water at a small distance from the house, which is at once striking and beautiful. Mr. Boyd was created a baronet in 1775, and his grandson disposed of the estate and mansion to John Johnston, Esq., for the sum of \u00a350,000. The estate remained in the hands of Mr. Johnston's family down to the year 1865, when it was purchased by Mr. Bean. Welling Chapel. \u2014 Welling Chapel was built by a few friends who held a meeting for the purpose under a tent in a field on September 7th, 18-30, Mr. John Moginie presiding. Before that the only Noncon formist services had been conducted in private houses, assisted by ministers and friends from Woolwich and other places. About \u00a340 was subscribed towards the cost of the chapel, which was built on a leasehold site in the village, at a cost of \u00a3450. Various ministers filled the pulpit, but the debt was a distressing incubus, and in 1846 the chapel was closed for eighteen months. The Greenwich District Association then came forward, and, finding the creditors willing to accept half the \u00a3200 which was their due, raised the money and cleared off the incumbrance on August 31st, 1857. Several preachers then took up the work, amongst them being the Rev. T. Tuffield, of Woolwich, who conducted the service for many years. East Wickham and Welling, though still in a primitive state, are not without evidences of past changes. Swingate Lane. \u2014 The plan of 1720 (page 520) shows plainly the old road (Swingate Lane) to Wickham Green from Plumstead Common, now nearly obsolete, and also the road (even then in process of decay) from the Slade eastward across the fields to Wickham Lane and Abbey Wood.* Two or three other roads across the fields between Plumstead Common and the Dover Road are traceable, but the whole of this tract is left bare on the plan of 1720, being of no concern to the estate for which it was prepared. * See page 500."], [319, "627 EAST WICKHAM AND WELLING. Wickham and Plumstead. \u2014 The connection between East Wick ham and Plumstead at this period (1795) is described by Lysons as follows : \u2014 East Wickham is a chapel of ease to Plumstead, being always held by the friar of that place, who i3 instituted to his Vicarage with the chapel of East Wickham an nexed. The great tithes of this parish passed with those of Plumstead till the year 1575, when they were conveyed by Sir Edward Boughton* to John (afterwards Sir John) Hawkins, who settled them on his hospital for decayed mariners at Chatham. They are now (1795) in the tenure of Mr. Christopher Chapman. Population. \u2014 There is no register of baptisms earlier than 1730, nor of burials than 1715.

The Roman Road. \u2014 The long straight highway over Shooters' Hill to Dover is part of the Roman road called Watling Street,* forming an important section of the great military thoroughfare which bisected the country as far as Chester, and is supposed to have been constructed by Julius Agricola (a.d. 71-85). Why the Bomans should have climbed up and down high hills, when they could have found their way upon the level plain (through Eltham, for instance), would surprise us but for the consideration that each eminence was probably occupied as an observing station, and possibly as a fortification, keeping up a chain of defence and communication along the whole route. Shooters' Hill, Dartford Hill, Windmill Hill at Gravesend, Chatham Lines, and the other heights on the direct road to Dover are believed to have been all thus utilized. The road was not, however, a broad thoroughfare as we now see it, but its width may be compared to that of its original continuation, the Old Dover Road, and the lane through Westcombe Park.f The * The Kev.

History, however, affords us little information respecting the early days of either the road or the hill. The Shooters. \u2014 We may safely conclude that the name of \" Shooters' Hill\" was derived from the archers who were accustomed to resort thither in the olden time for the practice of their craft. Every man and every youth learned to draw the bow, and some of the experts could propel an arrow with good aim a distance of four hundred and fifty yards. The target in the time of Henry VIII. was a hazel rod set up at a space of four hundred yards. Henry VIII. a-Maying. \u2014 An entertaining description is given in \" Hollinshead's Chronicles \" of a Mayday festival, in which Henry VIII., his queen, and his nobles indulged in the year 1-511. The queen referred to is the King's first wife, Catherine of Arragon. Hollins head says : \u2014 The court lieng at Greenwich, the king and the queue, accompanied with manie lords and ladies, road to the high ground of Shooters hill to take the open aire ; and as they passed by the waie, they espied a company of taU yeomen clothed all in greene, with greene hoods and bowes and arrowes, to the number of two hundred. Then one of them which called himself Bobin hood, came to the king desiring him to see his men shoot, and the king was content. Then he whisteled, and all the two humlred archers shot and losed at once ; and then he whisteled againe, and they likewise shot againe. Their arrows whisteled by craft of the head, so that the noise w.is strange and great, and much pleased the king, the queene, and all the companie. All these archers were of the kings gard, and had thus apparalled themselves to make solace to the king. Then Bobin hood desired the king and queene to come into the greene wood, and to see how the outlaws lived. The king demanded of the queene and hir ladies if they durst adventure to go into the wood with so manie outlawes. Then the queene said that if it pleased him, she was content. Then the homes blew till they came to the wood vnder shooters' hill, and there was an arbor made of boughes with a hall and a great chamber ; and an inner chamber, verie well made and covered with flowers and sweet hearbs, which the king much praised. Then said Robin hood : \" Sir, outlawe's breakefasts is venison, and, therefore, you must be content with such fare as we vse.\" Then the king and queene sat downe, and were served made their way. This was necessarily before the Thames was bounded, narrowed, and deepened by the river-wall. There is a divergence of opinion among the modern authorities as to the spot at which Julius C\u00e6sar crossed the river, but it is improbable that he touched London, which was then a town of inferior importance. C\u00e6sar's own account of his progress leads us to infer that after passing Crayford he made haste to the river, and it is almost certain that just after crossing he turned his back to London and advanced upon and captured the royal city of Colchester. It is contrary to reason to suppose that he flew off at a tangent to pass over Blackheath and march parallel with the river for any number of miles, and yet, so far as I can ascertain, no writer has looked in the direction I have indicated for the passage. I submit as feasible that he con tinued in a straight course from Shooters' Hill to the Thames, and crossed either at Charlton or Greenwich \u2014 probably at Blackwall point."], [323, "631 SHOOTERS' HILL. with venison and wine by Robin hood and his men, to their great contentation. Then the king departed and his companie, and Robin hood and his men them conducted ; and, as they were returning, there met with them two ladies in a rich chariot drawn with five horeses, and every horsse had his name on his head, and on every horsse sat a lady with her name written, and they saluted the king with diverse goodlie songs, and so brought him to Greenwich. At this maieng was a great number of people to behold it to their great solace and comfort. Anne of Cleves. \u2014 Over Shooters' Hill on a later occasion came Anne of Cleves to a pavilion of cloth of gold at its foot. The king Henry VIII. Maying at Shooters' Hill. went from Greenwich to meet her with great pomp. Henry was also present at many of the archery contests and other sports which went on at the butts on the hill. The Civil War. \u2014 During the Great Rebellion (1648) Fairfax and his Roundheads had an adventure at Shooters' Hill, which Colonel Colomb has engrafted upon his story of \" For King and Kent ;\" which is, by the way, attributed allegorically to \" Lovelesse of Woollage.\""], [324, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 632 The authority is a MS. in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, which quotes a letter from Rushworth to the Parliament as follows : \u2014 As the General (Fairfax) was marching over Shotover Hill (i.e. Shooters') to see how the enemy had placed their guards, a trumpeter came from them desiring my lord to grant a pass to their commissioners to treat, according to the order of Parlia ment, signed Peyton. The trumpeter said Squire Hales was their General, Sir Thomas \u00b0Peyton Lieut.-General, and Sir John Mainy Major-General. His excel lency returned answer by a trumpeter of his own. Major Husbands was sent with a party of horse to Dartford, and the General quartered this night (May 30th) at Eltham.* Another letter of the same date says : \u2014 Colonel Rich and Colonel Berkstead possessed themselves of the heath (Black heath) betimes. The enemy is on the other side of Shooters' Hill. They have killed one of Colonel Rich's men and we have taken thirty, with their arms, but none hurt. Another letter in a diurnal says : \u2014 They shot one of our troopers, who is dead, as gallant a stout man as any in the army. We neither killed nor wounded any of them, but took about thirty prisoners, and them the soldiers changed clothes with, and brought them away bound with matches. The dead man is known as Sergeant Lobb in the narrative of Colonel Colomb, who speaks of him as being buried in the wood, and says in a note : \u2014 The Kentish Independent a few years ago reported the discovery of a skeleton in Shooters' Hill Wood, and advanced a theory that it was some victim of Dick Turpin. It seems just as likely to have been the trooper in question. The Road a Border-line. \u2014 Shooters' Hill Road, according to our historian Lambarde, was in the olden days the boundary line of kingdoms. He says : \u2014 Furthermore I find in historie that this Watling Streete hath heretofore not onely served for the free passage of the people, but that it hathe beene at times also a marke and bounder between some kings for the limits of their jurisdictions and authoritie, for so it was betweene Edmund and Anlaf, Alfred and Guthram, and others. * In Majr, 1648, the Royalists of Kent at Canterbury petitioned Parliament to treat with the King (then at Carisbrook Castle) and raised a body of six thousand horse and one thousand foot, who advanced to New Cross under Edward Hales and Sir Thomas Peyton, where General Fairfax met them with offers of pardon if they laid down their arms, and menaces in case of refusal. The majority, having aban doned eight guns, retreated to Dartford. Fairfax, with four regiments of horse, three ol foot, and some companies of Colonel Ingoldsbie's regiment, bivouacked all night in the fields of Eltham. Next day three hundred cavalry and one hundred foot set out in pursuit, under Major Husbands, and encountered at Northfleet six hundred Royalists, who fled and created such dismay that the pursuers found not a man in Gravesend. Fairfax attacked Maidstone on Friday, 2nd June, slew two hundred and captured fourteen hundred, and the Royalists of Kent never recovered the blow. \u2014 Hasted: Dr. Drake's edition."], [325, "shooters' hill. 633 The Beacon Fire. \u2014 A beacon formerly blazed on the summit of Shooters' Hill as a signal to the other hills around \u2014 Knockholt and Gravesend hills in Kent, Leith Hill in Surrey, Hampstead in Middlesex and Purfleet in Essex. The beacon was erected either during or prior to the sixteenth century, for it is mentioned by Lambarde in 1570.* It is also marked in Ogilby's Roadbook of 1720. Mr. Hewitt's \" old villager \" told him that he remembered it standing on the south or Eltham side of the road about 1810, and this position is thought to be favoured by the payments to be found in the accounts of the Eltham churchwardens for \" watchinge the beacon on Shuters Hill.\" Telegraph. \u2014 The meadow adjoining Mr. Tongue's house in Eltham parish is still known as \" Telegraph Field,\" and the beacon fire lighted therein to celebrate the Jubilee in 1887 was fixed at the very spot on which the beacon was supposed to have stood. But I am convinced that there has been some misconception on the part of Mr. Hewitt and his old villager, and others who have formed their i in clusions on the hke premisses. Where Stood the Beacon? \u2014 In the first place it is necessary to declare that the name of the \"Telegraph Field\" is not in evidence regarding the beacon ; it has a different origin. In a little book which I have previously quoted, called The Water Companion from London to Gravesend, published in 1802, I find it stated that \u2014 A distant view of Shooters' Hill presents the high tower built thereon, and, to the ight (left ?) of the tower, the late-erected telegraph. This was a semaphore station from which messages were transmitted by signal in various directions. Remains of a similar station are still to be seen on the hill known as Cox's Mount, near Sand Street, Wool wich. It was the Shooters' Hill telegraph, and not the beacon, which Mr. Hewitt's villager saw \u2014 as we now see it at page 628. Then if we examine the Eltham vestry-book we find one of the entries to be in form thus : \u2014 (1614.) Paid to Wilham Leadsham, Constabell of the Hundred, the monie that Ealtham was sessed at for the reparation ofthe beacon at Shuters' Hill, and he to pay Sir Timothie Lowe, 3s.

His orthography, however, is amusing. In the same writing as the foregoing is another reference to Shooters' Hill which shows how little importance the writer attached even to consistency in his spelling. (1614.) Paid to a poore man that was robbed at Shoutershelle of all that he had, and a hundred mile home, 6d. Amid all its vicissitudes the name of the hill has never undergone a stranger transformation than this. The Beacon in Plumstead. \u2014 Where, then, stood the Shooters' Hill Beacon ? That it was near to the imagined spot is undeniable, but, notwithstanding the evidences quoted, I fix the site not on the south, but on the north side \u00b0f the road on the very summit of the hill and in t]ie parish of Plumstead. I have lighted upon an 0\\^ roa(j map; probably of about A.D. 1600, from which I have copied and enlarged the The Beacon on Shooters' delineation of this spot. There can be no doubt that this map, which, though small, is carefully drawn, correctly represents the situation of the old beacon, t The beacon consisted of an iron cage suspended from a gibbet by a chain. Fires of faggots and even of coal were burnt in the cage. The Use of Beacons. \u2014 The reference to this beacon by Lanibarde, the Kentish historian, in 1570, is contained in an instructive argument on the general subject, in which he says : \u2014 As in warre celeritie availeth no lesse than force itself, so the officers of hir majesties household, seeing how necessarie it was to have the forces of the countrie speedily drawn together for the encounter of any hostilitie, and finding that upon fiering of the Beacons which are erected for that service, not only the common sort, but men of place and honour, were ignorant which way to direct their course, and thereby through amazednesse as likely to run from the place affected as to make to the succour of it, caused the true places of the beacons to be plotted in earde, with directorie lines, so many sundrie waies, by which any man by little labour may be assured where the danger is and thereof informe his neighbours. For example, supposing our first beacon, standing on Shooters' Hill, to be light, he that will go thither may know by the watchman from whence they receive their light, wliich must be from the west * The Hundred of Blackheath. Contributions were probably required from the adjoining Hundred of Lesness (including Plumstead), and possibly of the whole \"Lathe\" of Sutton, or Dartford. t The lane which went to \" Chiselherst \" may be noticed in this sketch.

Kentish Beacons. From Lambarde's Map of 1596, Watch and Ward. \u2014 In the year 1593 a statement was presented to Queen Elizabeth showing \u2014 Reasons why those of Kent desire moderation in the assessment of purveyance for her Majesty's household. Kent is a maritime country, compelled to watch the beacons, and keep watch and ward on the coast, and, on every approach or show of the enemy, driven to put on arms and keep the field oftener than any other shire of the realm. The Royal Navy continually Res in harbour within that shire, and the storehouses of Deptford, Woolwich, Rochester, Chatham, &c, are chiefly served by the shire by commission, as weU with victuals as timber, labourers, carriages, &c, for building and repairing ships. Macaulay's Armada refers to these beacons, and to the same period, as follows : \u2014 And eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand went, And roused in many an ancient hall the gaUant squires of Kent. Southward from Surrey's pleasant hiUs flew these bright couriers forth ; High on bleak Hampstead's swarthy moor they started for the north. And on and on without a pause, untired they bounded still ; All night from tower to tower they sprang ; they sprang from hiU to hill. Shrewsbury Park. \u2014 There are several goodly mansions planted on Shooters' Hill, the most interesting of which is Shrewsbury House, centred in beautiful and extensive grounds east of Shrewsbury (or Plum) Lane. The house is chiefly noted as having been the residence"], [328, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 636 of Princess Charlotte from 1799 to 1S01 (?).* Hasted's \"Kent,\" of 1796, records that \u2014 The Earl of Shrewsbury has lately built a smaU but elegant house on Shooters'' Hill for a residence \u2014 a statement which explains its title, but does not satisfactorily account for the date of erection. In Lysons' Supplement, published in 1811, it is said that the house was built by Mr. John Lidgbird, and that it was some time the residence of the then late Earl of Roslyn, Shrewsbury House, Shooters' Hill. when Solicitor-General. The same authority informs us that in 1794 it was in the occupation of Mr. John Stanley, and we also learn that after it was vacated by her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte (in 1801 ?), it was taken by Mr. Winser, who was succeeded in it about 1811 by Colonel Hay, of the East India Company's service. Mr. Lidgbird, who was an important personage in the county, resided for many years on the hill, where his descendants, Mrs. Dallin and Mrs. W. Jackson, have been well known in our day and generation. Mr. Lidgbird died in 1767, and his monument is in Plumstead Old Church. I have reason to conclude that the house was built in 1741, and was the seat of Mr. John Lidgbird at his decease, when his son Henry let it to Mr. John Stanley. * The journal of Dr. Porteous, Bishop of London, says : \u2014 \" Yesterday (6th August, 1801), I had a very pleasant day at 'Shrewsbury House, near Shooters' HiU, the residence of the Princess Charlotte.\""], [329, ""], [330, "PLATE LXIV.

John Smallman Masters, vicar of Christ Church, Shooters' Hill, occupied Shrewsbury House and Park for a good many years, and has informed me of his belief that the Princess Charlotte resided there in 1802-3, whilst her mother, Queen Caroline, lived at Old Charlton. The unhappy dissensions of the by gone Prince and Princess of Wales and the lamented end of the Princess Charlotte are well-known matters of history. Charlotte was tbe only child of the Regent who became George IV. Some references to her and her parents will be found under the head of Charlton.

A Gaming Affair. \u2014 Shrewsbury House and Park have the dis credit of having been at one time lost and won in a gambling bout, not unconnected with persons of exalted rank, but the place has a white record in tbe character of those who have for several generations lived unblemished lives upon the lovely spot, and the guileless happiness which the park has afforded to thousands of innocents at the summer school fetes has been sufficient to efface the stain of deeper follies than the extravagances of a bygone age. It is now hallowed still more as a home for the restoration of convalescent children. Gas Invented. \u2014 Shrewsbury House may also claim our respect as the birthplace of an invention which has been almost equal in value to any other discovery ofthe present century. Here the Mr. Winser just mentioned spent a fortune in experiments with gas, prior to the intro duction of the now indispensable illuminant, and is said to have erected in his grounds the first gasometer ever seen out of a laboratory. The invention was greatly ridiculed and opposed, and Mr. Winser received very little sympathy in his misfortunes, though they led the way to the affluence of thousands and the convenience of millions all over the world. A Prehistoric Monument. \u2014 Opposite the lodge of Shrewsbury Park, and within the enclosure of Tower House, is the mound which s s"], [332, "638 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. I have described as having the appearance of an ancient barrow.* In 1850, tbe whole of the ground now enclosed hereabout was known as \" the Furze-field,\" a broad and open waste, and this mound, with its beautiful coronet of trees, was the favourite spot for a picnic. Shrews bury Lane, then more than now, afforded magnificent views of the river scenery for miles in each direction. Several times have I when a lad watched with awe from niy bed at Woolwich the incendiary fires of the Furze-field. To light the furze on Shooters' Hill and Plumstead Common was a youthful amusement which, though forbidden, was scarcely checked in the early Victorian era. Tower House. \u2014 Tower House was built on the Furze- field about 1855 by Mr. George Hall Graham, for his own residence, but it long lay empty and was stigmatised as \" Graham's Folly.\" Among its occupants has been \" Lord Teynham,\" formerly of the Royal Artillery, a pious philanthropist whose special delight was a tea-party of cabmen at Tower House.

The top of the tower and the top of St. Paul's were nearly on a level.* There is a magnificent view from the summit.

A Pleasant Resort. \u2014 Severndroog Castle, according to the testi mony of Mr. F. Hart in his \" History of Lee,\" was a favourite resort of families in the early part of the century, at which time it was well taken care of by the lodge-keeper, under its liberal owner, Mr. John Blades, ex-sheriff of London, who purchased it about the year 1816, it being a conspicuous object eastward of his mansion at Brockwell Hill, near Dulwich. It was a festive resort in 1836, in which year we find the following advertisement of a gipsy party to be held on July 12th : \u2014 July 12th, 1836. \u2014 Mr. John Smith solicits the company of his friends to join a select gipsy party at Shooters' Hill on Tuesday, to be continued annually.

The public found no difficulty in gaining admission to the castle until about the year 1850, when the privilege was withdrawn, and the road which led through the wood past the tower was at the same time closed. The tower has three floors, an entrance vestibule and a gallery, which t Page 204. * Page 647. SS2"], [334, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 640 was originally painted with scenes from the investment of Severndroog. In the vestibule were arranged trophies of arms taken from the robber's fortress by Commodore James, who is known to history as the \" Welsh ploughboys\" The Story of Severndroog.\u2014 The following is the story of Severn droog, as told in Orme's \" Hindostan\" : \u2014 Conagee Angria was a notorious freebooter, belonging to the Morattoe pirates, who had declared war by sea and land against the Grand Mogul, because he had employed an admiral to protect his Mahometan subjects against their depredations. By means of his prowess during this war, Conagee Angria had raised himself from a private man to be not only commander-in-chief of the Morattoe fleet, but was entrusted with the government of Severndroog, one of the strongest holds belonging to the Saha Rajah, or King of the Morattoes, and, having seduced others of his fellow subjects, set up a government against his sovereign along the sea-coast, to the extent of one hundred and twenty miles, and an inland country of from twenty to thirty miles towards the mountains. The successors of this fortunate robber took the name of Angria, and so fortified themselves that the rajah consented to let them have peaceable possession upon acknowledging his sovereignty, and paying a small tribute. In the course of fifty years this state, by means of piracies exercised indiscrimin ately upon ships of all nations, had rendered itself so formidable to the European traders to India that the British East Indian Company alone were compelled to keep up a maritime force, at the annual expense of i'50,000, as a check upon Angria, and a protection to their ships and colonies. Attempts had frequently been made by different nations to overturn this piratical system, but Angria's successes had made him insolent. He threw off his allegiance to his sovereign, and slit the noses of his ambassadors who came to demand the tribute. Under these circumstances the rajah made proposals to the British to attack this common enemy with their united force. Commodore James, at that time commander-in-chief of the Company's marine force, sailed on the 22nd of March, 1775, in the Protector, of forty-four guns, with a ketch of sixteen guns, and two bomb-vessels, but such was the exaggerated opinion of Angria's strongholds that the Presidency instructed him not to expose the Company's vessels to any risk by attacking them, but only to blockade the harbours, whilst the Morattoe army carried on their operations by land. Three days after, the Morattoe fleet, consisting of seven grabs and sixty gallivats, came out of Choul, having on board ten thousand land forces ; and the united fleets proceeded to Comara Bay, where they anchored in order to permit tlie Morattoes to get their meal on shore, since they are prohibited by their religion from eating or washing at sea. Departing from hence, they anchored again about fifteen miles to the north of Severndroog, where Rama-gee Punt with the troops disembarked, in order to proceed the rest of the way by land. Commodore James now receiving intelligence that the enemy's fleet lay at anchor in the harbour of Severndroog, represented to the admiral of the Morattoe fleet that by proceeding immediately thither they might come upon them in the night, and so effectually blockade them in the harbour that few or none would be able to escape. The Morattoe seemed highly to approve the proposal, but had not authority enough over his officers to make any of them stir before the morning, when the enemy, discovering them under sail, immediately slipped their cables and put to sea. The commodore then flung out the signal for a general chase, but as Rttle regard was paid to this as to his former intention ; for, although the vessels of the Morattoes had hitherto"], [335, "shooters' hill. 641 sailed better than the English, such was their terror of Angria's fleet that they all kept behind, and suffered the Protector to proceed alone almost out of their sight. The enemy, on the other hand, exerted themselves with uncommon industry, flinging overboard all their lumber to lighten their vessels, not only crowding all the sails they could bend, but also hanging up their garments, and even their turbans to catch every breath of air. The Protector, however, came within gunshot of some of the sternmost ; but, the evening approaching, Commodore James gave over the chase, and returned to Severndroog, which he had passed several miles. Here he found Rama gee Punt with the army besieging, as they said, the three forts on the mainland, but they were firing only from one gun, a four-pounder, at the distance of two miles, and \u25a0even .at this distance, the troops did not think themselves safe without digging pits in which they sheltered themselves, covered up to the chin, from the enemy's fire. The commodore, judging from these operations that they would never take the forts, determined to exceed the instructions which he had received from the Presidency rather than expose the English arms to the disgrace they would suffer if an expedition in which they were believed by Angria to have taken so great a share should mis carry. The next day, the 2nd of April, he began to bombard and cannonade the fort of Severndroog, situated on the is land, but, finding that the walls on the western side, which he attacked, were mostly cut out of the solid rock, he changed his station to the north - east, between the island and the mainland, where, whilst one of his broadsides Severndroog Castle in 1876. plied the north-east bastions of this fort, the other fired on Fort Goa, the largest of those upon the mainland. The bastions of Severndroog, however, were so high that the Protector could only point her upper tier at them, but, being anchored within a hundred yards, the musketry in the round tops drove the enemy from their guns, and by noon the parapet of the north-east bastion was in ruins ; when a shell from the bomb-vessels set fire to a thatched roof, which the garrison, dreading the Protector's musketry, were afraid to extinguish. The blaze spreading fiercely at this dry season of the year, all the buildings of the fort were soon in flames, and amongst them a magazine of powder blew up. On this disaster, the inhabitants, men, women, and children, with the greatest part of the garrison, in all near one thousand persons, ran out of the fort, and, embarking in seven or eight large boats, attempted to make their escape to Fort Goa ; but they were prevented by the English ketches, who took"], [336, "642 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. them all. The Protector now directed her fire only against Fort Goa, when the enemy, after suffering a severe cannonade, hung out a flag as a signal of surrender ; but while the Morattoes were marching to take possession of it, the governor,. perceiving that the commodore had not yet taken possession of Severndroog, got into a boat with some of his most trusty men, and crossed over to the island, hoping to be able to maintain the fort until he should receive assistance from Dabul, which is in sight of it. Upon this, the Protector renewed her fire upon Severndroog, and the commodore, finding that the governor wanted to protract the defence until night, when it was not to be doubted that some boats from Dabul would endeavour to throw succours into the place, he landed half his seamen, under cover of the fire of the ships, who with great intrepidity ran up to the gate, and, cutting down the sally-port with their axes, forced their way into it, on which the garrison surrendered. The other two forts on the mainland had by this time hung out flags of truce, and the Morattoes took possession of them. This was all the work of one day, in which the spirited resolution of Commodore James destroyed the timorous prejudices which had for twenty years been entertained of the impracticability of reducing any of Angria's fortified harbours. Medicinal Springs. \u2014 Shooters' Hill appears to have been long famous for its mineral wells, and there is abundance of water still to be found just under its surface, even on the crown of the hill, where a few ponds exist to attest the fact. As early as 1673, William Goodbird published at his printing-office in London an account of \" The Mineral Well on the top of Shooters' Hill.\" I find in the Record Office that John Guy, who was in 1675 tenant of the ground on which the wells existed, claimed to have discovered their medicinal qualities, and called them the \" The Purging Wells.\" They were three in number, and his successor, Charles Goodcheafe, of Plumstead, yeoman, built over one of them a small house. On the Hill-top.- \u2014 -Hughson, in his \"Circuit of London,\" as recently as 1808, also speaks of \"the spring on the top of Shooters' Hill,\" which, he says, constantly overflows the well and is not frozen in the sharpest winters. John Evelyn, in his \" Diary,\" tells us in August, 1699, \" I drank the Shooters' Hill waters,\" and we learn from the London Dispensatory that the mineral well of Shooters' Hill was resorted to for sulphate of magnesia (or Epsom salts) in 1700. Our Mineral Well.\u2014 \"The Mineral Well \" at Shooters' Hill, as known to the moderns, was, however, not \"at the top,\" as described by Goodbird and Hughson. Our mineral well was and is on the eastern edge of the waste ground behind the Royal Military Academy, and was seen until about 1870 under a shed in the garden of a cottage (in rear of the Eagle Tavern) occupied by a sapper, who had charge of the well on behalf of the Government, and was happy to supply visitors at a small fee. The shed which covered this well seems to connect it with Charles Goodcheafe aforesaid, but the shed has now disappeared, and the well is seen in the garden under a flat stone. An analysis of its"], [337, "SHOOTERS' HILL. 643 water was made in 1840 by Mr. James Marsh, chemist, Royal Arsenal, who found that a quart of it contained the following ingredients : \u2014 Grains. Sulphate of magnesia, or Epsom salts .... 88 Muriate of magnesia 10 Muriate of soda, or common salt 32 Sulphate of lime 8 Carbonate of lime ........ 10 Argil, or common clay, with a little calx of iron, both diffused but not dissolved 3 Total 151 aud likewise some carbonic acid and vegetable mucilage. Other Wells. \u2014 A wayside well existed on the south of Shooters' Hill road until recently, but is now filled up and obliterated. It occu pied the south-east corner of the castle approach, and was opposite \" the Limes.\" This was virtually, if not actually, at \"the top of the hill,\" the remainder of the ascent being scarcely perceptible ; but it was not generally regarded as medicinal. It was a dipping well, into which there was a descent of one or two steps. The three wells owned by John Guy, being of similar character, were probably near to each other, and, as the water on the summit is free from the chemical qualities which mark the product of the mineral well behind the Academy, it may almost be concluded that the three wells were upon the latter spot. As this is at the side rather than the top of the hill, the description of Goodbird and Hughson maybe taken figuratively. A Lost Chance. \u2014 In any case it would appear that Shooters' Hill might without much effort have rivalled the more fashionable watering-places of the last century. A Town on Shooters' Hill.\u2014 Although it has escaped the fortune of Bath and Tunbridge Wells, attempts have not been wanting to turn tbe attractions of Shooters' Hill to profitable account. In 1769 a grand scheme was propounded, and on January 17 of that year, people were invited to come forward and make their fortunes by it. They were informed that \u2014 In the circle of the new town to be built on Shooters' Hill is to be a Bason of Water, and in the Centre of that Bason a Circular Island on which a Coffee House is to be erected, and over it an Assembly Room, the entrance to which is to be by Four Bridges, and from which there are to be Four Grand Streets, leading to form different High Roads to be made for Greenwich, Woolwich, Gravesend, and the High Road over Shooters' Hill. A Crescent. \u2014 In July of the same year appeared an advertisement stating that \u2014 - Several eminent surveyors are engaged in drawing and settling a plan for con structing and building an elegant circus and several other houses on Shooters' Hill, in the prosecution of wliich several sums of money will be wanted."], [338, "644 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Toiled hopes. \u2014 But there were no building societies in 1769, and all these grand ideas came to nothing. In 1808 Hughson disposes of the business thus : \u2014 A scheme was lately in agitation to build a town at Shooters' Hill, and several houses were erected, but for want of encouragement the speculation did not succeed. A Big Bore. \u2014 A still more magnificent enterprise was projected in 1810. Notices were published of a proposal to make a tunnel under Shooters' Hill and improve the road to Blackheath, which was said to be \" deep in sand.\" An article appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine of the same date ridiculing the scheme, and nothing came of the pro posed tunnel through Shooters' Hill. Sun-in-the-Sands. \u2014 The mention of the road deep in sand reminds me that this fact originated the curious name of The- Sun-in-tke- Sands borne by a well-known tavern on the Blackheath Road, the title being applied to it by the Kentish drovers. This tavern, by the way, was badly associated with the exploits of the highwaymen. Proposed Fortress. \u2014 We bear of various propositions to construct a great fortress on Shooters' Hill, but reasons of strategy have of late precluded the subject from serious consideration. The most recent attempt we read of was in 1837, in which year a newspaper paragraph informed the public that \u2014 The military survey of Shooters' Hill is proceeding rapidly, but it is feared that the mercenary demands of the landowners will compel the Board of Ordnance to alter the whole plan of the contemplated fortifications. Linn\u00e6us and the Gorse. \u2014 Shooters' Hill is much the better for being let alone. A century back the sylvan beauty of tbe hill was enhanced by the open woodlands, and the broader expanse of the waste land to the westward stretching down a bank of golden furze from the edge of the wood to the bottom of Kidbrook Common, where it is now covered by the Herbert Hospital. It is said that here the great Linn\u00e6us, beholding the scene \u2014 Wrapped in a golden fleece of blossoms. fell on his knees and worshipped. Roadside Strips. \u2014 The high road crossed the open waste at the upper part of Woolwich Common ; and Kidbrook Common, just men tioned, extended along the roadside far towards Blackheath. It is easy to see where its patches of sward have been enclosed in various places and at various times. These green fringes by the roadside were originally left for the pasturage of cattle moving from place to place, and ought always to be preserved for the good of the public, to whom the law has decided that they rightfully belong."], [339, "SHOOTERS' hill. 645 The Road Transformed. \u2014 And now, seeking among the records \u25a0of the ancient highways, I discover that the familiar road is not, in its integrity, entirely and absolutely, the old \"Watling Street\" after all. On the whole it may fairly represent throughout its course the original Roman way, but, strictly speaking, a part of it has taken new ground, and this is on Shooters' Hill. Tbe present road down the eastern slope towards Welling was certainly not made by Agricola, nor Adrian, Antonius nor Severus. It did not exist a.d. 100 nor a.d. 1000, but was constructed only the other day, in 1739, and it was solely due to the highwaymen. Robbers. \u2014 Always a favourite haunt of robbers was this hill, and half its stories, if we could have them, would tell of cut-throats and cut-purses. In order to secure the lives and property of the travellers by this road, the most important in the kingdom, wealthy and influen- tial persons were usually attended by armed escorts, while others journeyed if possible in company for their mutual protection. But, in spite of all precautions, the travellers were always in jeopardy, and the robbers flourished. From an early date a remedy was sought in road improvements, for the thoroughfare over the hill, besides being narrow, was oftentimes out of repair. Thus, in the sixth year of King Edward II. (a.d. 1313), an order was made for \"enlarging the highway\" on \"Shoter's Held,\" which was \"a place of great dread to travellers, owing to the narrowness of the road over it and the continual lurking-nests of robbers in the woods and coppices.\" So also Edward III., soon after he came to the throne (1327), granted leave to Thomas Chapman to \" cut down, burn and sell, all the woods adjoining Shooters' Hill on tbe south side, and bestow the money upon the highway.\" But all these measures were of no permanent advantage, and, for the next 400 years the road continued to be so hollow and so slender as to be a mere defile, from which a passenger, if waylaid, found escape impossible ; and continual robberies were committed, even at noonday. But in 1739, for the first time,* vigorous measures were taken to cope with the evil, by the appointment of trustees, with power to execute works and levy tolls, and it was resolved, instead of tinkering with the old road any longer, to reconstruct it altogether. This drastic cure was, how- ever, confined to the eastern side of the hill, which was the chief source of danger, the slope towards London having been previously widened and improved for the convenience of tho people who had made it their place of residence. Accordingly, the trustees abandoned the old road from the crown to the foot eastward, laid out the present road a little to the south, and cleared away much of the wood beside * In 1701, one William Paine, of Eltham, willed 6s. 8d. a year to the repair of \" Shuters Hill,\" with power to the surveyors of Eltham and Plumstead to distrain."], [340, "646 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. it. The superseded road remained in existence until 1796, and, although ploughed up and cultivated now, can still be traced on the north side of the descent. Few, if any, of this generation, have heard of this metamorphosis, but we are within touch of it by some dealings with the trustees aforesaid, for the New Cross Trust and its vexatious turnpikes ceased to exist as recently as 1868. Our elders well remember the interruption and the tax which they had to endure at the turnpike gates, and they were glad enough when these were removed by an act of Parliament, which at tbe same time swept away the toll bars at Charlton and Greenwich, and all the other obstructions of the Lower Road Trust. They were, however, not born soon enough to appreciate deliverance from the highwaymen, although these gentry still lingered about the neighbourhood some way into this century7. Knights of the Road. \u2014 -Of the crimes committed by desperadoes at Shooters' Hill many instances might be quoted. Tbe fellows are said to have grown so daring and so much feared that they actually organised a system of supplying passes at a certain fixed tariff to such as chose to recognise their authority and pay tbe stipulated tribute. When Dr. Watson was tutor to Princess Charlotte at Shrewsbury House in 1S00, he was furnished (for a handsome consideration) with a certificate from the knights of the road which carried him safely past their masked videttes upon the hill, and was respected by every bush ranger from end to end of the dreaded highway. Smugglers. \u2014 Mr. Hewitt discovered that smugglers succeeded the highwaymen in the possession of Shooters' Hill Wood. I have cited his \"old inhabitant,\" but I have my suspicions, and Mr. Hewitt, and not the author of these records, must be responsible for the thrilling tales of this diverting villager. Cargoes of .spirits and tea and tobacco, he says, were brought up hither from the Thames and hidden in the bush and fern. On one occasion, we are told, a country fellow stumbled on a hoard of tea, and filled his pockets. The smugglers, who were on the watch, did not object to anything in reason, but when the rustic returned with a sack he found that the rule of \" do\"- rob-dog \" is to be tolerated only within limits, for the smugglers beat him nearly to death. The \"Old Bull.\"\u2014 On the very crest of Shooters' Hill stood the Bull Hotel, one of the most famous of the halting places on the London and Dover road, and a place of resort much patronised by the neighbouring gentry. It stood on the spot occupied by the present tavern, and reached to tbe position of the Old Bull, now removed, which was the hotel \" tap.\" I fancy that originally it must have been a private mansion. At all events, a large building which was not a"], [341, "shooters' hill. 647 tavern occupied the spot in 1720, as may be seen by reference to the Plumstead plan at page 520. It may have been a school, but so large an establishment of an educational character could hardly have existed near Woolwich without being mentioned by some of the chroniclers. The Bull was at the height of its glory from about 1790 until early in the present century. It had a grand salon in which balls and public dinners were held and entertainments given ; and it was the place selected for most of the banquets given by the officers at Woolwich before they bad their own mess-rooms. The main building was pulled down before I saw Shooters' Hill in 1849, but tbe tap at the eastern end remained, in the shape of a rather mean tavern, until a few years since, when it was superseded by the new Bull at the corner of Shrewsbury Lane. The Ambulator, in 1808, speaks of the Bull as \" a handsome km with gardens for the entertainment of those who visit this delightful spot.\" The First Church. \u2014 After the Bull was closed as an hotel, i.e. about 1820, it became a private residence, and before there was any regular place of worship on the hill the Rev. Thomas Dallin com- menced a service in the assembly room, but first removed the heavy enrichments of the ceiling, which were considered unsuited to religious exer cises. The house was at that time tenanted by the mother of Mr. Dallin's wife. I have often desired to see some representation of the old hostelry and was at length gratified by finding it in a geometrical survey showing the altitudes of London, presented to King George IV. by Frederick Wood and William Moffatt, in 1825. In the description which accompanies this sketch it is stated that the height of the hill, measured at \" the sill of the principal south entrance door of Dr. Barber's Academy, late Bull Inn, is 411 feet 9 inches and 85 points ; \" while the height of the cross of St. Paul's, which is figured below it, is \"406 feet, 8 inches and 85 points.\" Shooters' Hill The \"Old Bull\" Hotel and St. Paul's Cathe dral \u2014 their relative altitudes. is therefore exactly 5 feet 1 inch higher than St. Paul's Cathedral. It is, however, not the most elevated point in the metropolis \u2014 Highgate Hill being 414 feet 7 inches high, and Hampstead Heath, at Jack Straw's Castle, 433 feet 3 inches. The Catherine Wheel. \u2014 The predecessor of the Bull stood on the opposite side of the road, by the lane through the wood to Eltham. It is shown in the plan of 1720 (page 520), and was called the Catherine. Wheel. The spot is now occupied by a private house."], [342, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 648 The road at the summit, as may be plainly seen, has been reduced some feet in height, the banks at the side remaining at the original altitude. This work was done by the New Cross Trust when the road was remade in 1739. The surface ofthe road has been at all times repaired with the gravel of the hill, which is of an exceptionally excellent quality, and many depressions exist to show whence it has been quarried. The Bull was probably the halting place referred to in a curious poem entitled \" A Tour through Kent by a West-country Party,\" printed in 1771 :\u2014 At Zhooters' Hill we made a halt, for Polly's zaddle was in vault; And Joe was dry, and so was I, but George was wondrous testy ; Then Dolly said, \" As I'm a maid, Ize travel not so hasty.\" We calls a pot Of piping hot, but Couzen wodna taste it ; Zo George and she Had gin and tea, and Zister called for rattifee.. But I warrant they didna wast it. Zo we went, Cherry, merry, into Kent, into Kent, Winking, blinking, down we went. Red and Golden Lions. \u2014 The Bed Lion Tavern, lower down the hill, has the aspect of antiquity, but it did not exist in 1720. The Eagle in Red Lion Lane is still a mere fledgling, but the corner of Constitution Hill, upon which the Eagle looks, was occupied in 1720 by tbe Golden Lion, probably the Red Lion's ancestor. The straight cut past the Eagle, which we call Red Lion Lane, does not appear in our map of 1720, and it is shown in quite a rudimentary stage in Lysons' map of 1810. Tbe original road from Woolwich went up Constitution Hill, and through the Castle Wood to Eltham. Dick Turpin. \u2014 In connection with the Bull I have to do an act of justice. The notorious \" Dick Turpin \" is credited with some exploits at Shooters' Hill and round about it, and I fear that I have helped to give currency to one or more of the fables which are related of the historic highwayman. I have now searched tbe oldest and most authentic sources, and I find that Turpin was but a commonplace miscreant, who was hanged, some years too late, in 1739. His brutal act of putting tbe landlady on the tavern fire was perpetrated, not at the Bull on Shooters' Hill, but at Loughton, in Essex. The Bull, as the song says, \" wasn't born till after that.\" Nevertheless, there is some colour of fact in the assumption. The rascal undoubtedly frequented the district, and the true story of his life relates the following incident as having occurred close by : \u2014 * The next robbery of note they committed was about seven or eight o'clock in the evening. Rust, Turpin, Fielder, Walker and three others, came to the house of Mr. * The scene of the event here described is the house known as Springfield, Old Charlton, now occupied by Colonel V. D. Majendie, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Explosives. He writes : \u2014 \" It has occurred to me thai, it may be of interest to you to know that this house, which I at present occupy with my brother-in-law, Sir Fleet wood Edwards, was robbed by Dick Turpin.\""], [343, "SHOOTERS' HILL. 649 Saunders, a wealthy farmer at Charlton, in Kent, and, knocking at the door, inquired if Mr. Saunders was at home. Being answered he was, and the door opened, they all rushed in, went directly to the parlour,* where Mr. Saunders, his wife and some friends, were at cards ; they desired them not to be frightened, for that they would not hurt their persons if they sat still and made no disturbance. The first thing they laid hands on was a silver snuff-box, which lay upon the table before them, and, having secured the rest of the company, obliged Mr. Saunders to go about the house with them and open his closets, boxes and escritoire, from whence they took upwards of ,\u00a3100 in money and all the plate in the house, a velvet hood, mantle and other things. While this was doing, the servant-maid got loose and ran upstairs, barred herself in one of the rooms, and called out of the window for assistance, in hopes of alarming the neighbourhood ; but one of the rogues ran upstairs after her, and with a poker broke open the door, brought her down again, bound her and all the rest of the family ; then they rifled the house of divers other things of value, and, finding in their search some bottles of wine, a bottle of brandy and some mince pies, drank a bottle of wine, ate mince pies, and obliged the company to drink a glass of brandy each. Mrs. Saunders fainted away with the fright : they got her a glass of water, and, putting some drops in it, gave it to her, and were very careful to recover her. They stayed a considerable time in the house, after feasting and packing up their booty; and when they departed they declared that if any of the family gave out the least alarm within two hours, or even advertised the mark of the plate they had taken, they would remember them for it, for they would return and murder them at a future time. This robbery was concerted at the George, at Woolwich, from whence they proceeded to put their design into execution ; and when they had effected it they crossed the water and brought their goods to an empty house in Ratcliffe Highway, provided for them by one of Dick Swift's acquaintances, where they deposited the plunder and divided the products. A Bad Name. \u2014 Generally speaking, the ancient reputation of Shooters' Hill may be pronounced an evil one. A few of the many reports which appear in the old newspapers on this subject may be appended, and the following should be associated with the history of the Bull Hotel :\u2014 July 22nd, 1785. \u2014 On Thursday evening, exactly at nine o'clock, eight gentlemen of a respectable character in the city, having been at an annual dinner at the Black Bull on Shooters' Hill, returning in two coaches to town, were stopped by two high waymen, well mounted, who thrust their pistols into each coach, and collected upwards of twenty pounds. Not being satisfied without their watches, they were opening the door to search, but, a postchaise suddenly coming by, the villains rode after the postboy, who not stopping directly they ordered liim, one of the robbers discharged his pistol at the lad, and then took a small sum from the passengers, and treated the driver with great inhumanity for what they called his inattention. The passengers by the AVoolwich stage-coach were no safer than tbe gentlemen who dined at the Bull : \u2014 September, 1752. \u2014 Last Thursday, in the afternoon, between five and six, a young gentleman was robbed in the Woolwich stage-cnach by two highwaymen, genteely mounted, near the Artichoke on Blackheath. They both came up to the coach door ; one of them clapped a pistol to his breast and demanded his money, on which * The present hall."], [344, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 650 he delivered all he had, but desired that they would return him one shilling to pay his coach fare, which they refused, but otherwise behaved very complaisantly, shook hands with him, and wished him good-night. They demanded money of a woman that was in the coach, but she having only two shiUings, they thought that not worth their taking ; they were both young men and went off towards Shooters' Hill. Of about similar date are the following : \u2014 Mr Swift butcher, of Sheerness, going from Rochester to London, was stopped by three footpads between Welling and Shooters' HiU,and robbed of twenty-five pounds and his watch. * * * About eight on Saturday night, four ladies and a gentleman, going down Shooters' Hill in their carriage, were stopped by three footpads armed ; one of them stood at the horses' heads with a blunderbuss, while the others got into the carriage and demanded their money, which they took, amounting to about forty pounds. \u00bb * * * Mr. Patterson, of Doctors' Commons, in company with another gentleman, going from Sittingbourne to London, in a postchaise, were stopped on Woolwich Common* (near Shooters' Hill) by two highwaymen, and robbed of twenty-five pounds, but refused their watches. A, * \u2022 * * Capt. Dempster, accompanied by a lady, was returning to London from Gravesend, on Friday night, about half after ten o'clock : at the foot of Shooters' HiU the chaise suddenly stopped ; the captain let down the front glass, and called to the postboy to know why he did not proceed 1 when, after a few groans, he replied that he had been suddenly knocked from off his horse, and that he was at first so stunned by the fall as to be unable to reply, and that the darkness of the night had pre vented his observing any one coming towards him, but that a man had hold of the horses' heads. The chaise door on the side the lady sat was in a few moments after opened, and a man appeared at it, at whom the Captain discharged a pistol : the fellow fell backwards, but whether from fright or from any wound he might have received is not ascertained. The other door was now opened, and the Captain fired a second pistol at the fellow who stood at it, but who, from the flash, Mr. D. observed kept rather towards the back part of the carriage, by wliich he probably saved his life. The captain had no ammunition left, but refused to deliver his money, and one of the footpads discharged a pistol into the chaise. In about two minutes after, on his still refusing to deliver, a second pistol was fired through the carriage, and so on every two minutes, until six pistols were fired, they always keeping rather behind the chaise door, in order as well to conceal their persons as to protect themselves. At length, owing to the fright the lady who accompanied Captain Dempster was in, he was induced to comply with their demands. They then ordered him to throw his watch and money out of the window into the road. He threw them one guinea and a half and his watch, which, with the chain and seals affixed to it, was valued at one hundred guineas, and by their direction the chaise drove on. These narratives should make us enjoy the happier era in which our lives are cast. Similar stories from all the outskirts of London are frequent in the early newspapers, and the following humoursome con fession was printed in the year 1674, under the title of \" Jackson's * See \" Roadside Strips,\" page 664."], [345, "SHOOTERS' HILL. 651 Recantation ; or the Life and Death of the Notorious Highwayman now hanging in chains at Hampstead \" : \u2014 Mr. Jackson and his associates were hovering about Shooters' Hill expecting the paid-off seamen from Chatham on their way to town. After easing the pockets of a great many stragglers, but carefully avoiding those who came three, four, or five in a body, they met with a parson coming from London, from whom they took fifteen pounds, generously returning him twenty shillings on receiving his promise that he would inform none what had happened, but he, meeting with a seaman, warned him to turn back lest he should meet with the same misfortune. The remainder of the story we tell in Mr. Jackson's own words : \u2014 The resolute seaman would not believe the parson, thinking it some idle chimera of his own invention, and so went on his way, and the parson on his. Coming up to the seaman, we told him to stand, who asked us what we meant ; we told him we wanted money. \" Alas, gentlemen,\" said lie, \" it is true I have some, which I received for my pay in his Majesty's service, and therefore it is pity to take that from me which I am carrying home for the mainten ance of my poor wife and children.\" If he had persuaded an angel to be his orator and pleaded in his behalf, it would have been all one, for no other sound pleased us but that of his money. When he saw that there was no remedy, he delivered all that he had, which was sixty-five pounds. \" Now, gentlemen,\" said he, \" let me beg one request of you, and that is, since I dare not go home to my wife, and at present know not what course of life to steer, admit me into your company ; yon see I am limbed well enough to qualify me for your occupation.\" We asked him whether he was in earnest ; he swore a hundred oaths he was in earnest, and was ready to be tried at that instant, insisting farther that lie was greatly in love with a trade that could get as much money in six minutes as he could do in three years. I was then the purse bearer, and, finding we had done enough for that day, we appointed a place to meet at and so distributed ourselves for the present ; only I had the charge of the seaman, who was wretchedly mounted, and therefore I needed not to fear him : besides as we rode along, I bound him over and over again by oaths to stand to what promise he had made us. At length, riding in a lane, suspecting nothing in the least, he turned his little hobby on me, and, seizing my bridle befpjre I was aware, clasped to my breast a little ugly brass-barreled pistol, and swore as savagely as if he had been one of the trade above twenty years if I would not instantly dismount he would send a bullet to my heart. I saw by his frightful countenance that there was no dallying, so I dismounted and gave him my horse ; and he in kindness bid me take his : such a beast I never saw on a common, so poor, so weak, that I was thinking to commit my safety to my own, and not to his, legs. You may imagine what a sweat I was in, being thus dismounted , for, having committed so many robberies that day, should I be met by any of the country, they would conclude me one of the robbers, seeing a man so splendidly accoutred riding on a beast hardly fit to feed crows and ravens. The night coming on favoured me, and I got among my associates ; and now I shall leave vou to guess whether their laughter or sorrow was greatest. First, that a stout thief (for so I was accounted) should be robbed by a hobbyhorse and a pot-gun; and secondly, so much money (about \u00a3180) lost, when secured beyond the probability of retaking. We heard the seaman, after he had paid himself, summoned in such brethren as had been robbed by us, and none else (but the parson), and returned them their money. The following advertisement appeared when newspapers and adver tising were just coming in vogue.

Hanged and Gibbeted. \u2014 It is satisfactory to know that the lives of the highwaymen were not \" all beer and skittles.\" They were assiduously hunted and always in terror of the fate which in nearly every case over took them. I have met with old inhabitants who remember two ruffians being hanged and gibbeted at the top of the hill and two others by the cross road at Eltham Bottom. These latter were Russell and King, a couple of desperadoes who resided at Blackheath, and suffered the penalty of their crimes in 1809. Their bones were discovered Highwayman in Gaming-house.

A Serious Frolic. \u2014 The following narrative, which is declared to be well founded, is hardly to be classed in the category of crime, but it affords a vivid illustration of the severity with which the law at one time visited even the suggestion of highway robbery. The date of the event is uncertain, but the account is quoted in Jones's Woolwich Journal of January lst, 1851, from the St. George's Chronicle and Grenada Gazette. The hero of this story was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and esteemed by all as a youth of courageous, talented, and sportive disposition. A sort of mess had been established among the senior cadets, to which officers holding His Majesty's commission received and accepted the invite. On one occasion the robberies which frequently took place on Shooters' Hill and Blackheath absorbed the conversation, and one party contended that it was folly to decide that a man was a poltroon because unarmed he did not relish the attack of a determined ruffian ; while the other side maintained that odds alone could clear the attacked from disgraceful submission, and, moreover, that no one possessed of presence of mind would allow himself to be taken by surprise. A military friend of our hero was one of the loudest in upholding the latter assertion, and swore that no single being should ever rob him. The cadet, perceiving that it was fruitless to discuss the subject, retired witli an arch smile, and took with him a brass candlestick from the sideboard. His friend shortly afterwards quitted, to return home. Though it was summer the night was rather dark, but the officer knew well the way across the fields to Blackheath, and had just bounded over a stile when a man advanced, presenting a weapon at his head and demanded his money. Without resistance he delivered up his cash and also his watch and pursued his journey. At the Academy tbe remainder of the cadets were continuing their carouse when their comrade, who was supposed to be in bed, entered the room laughing, and placed upon the table his brass candlestick, a watch and a purse, ejaculating, \" WeR, my boys, whom do you think this purse and watch belong to . \" None knew. \" To my friend F ,\" he said ; \" and how do you think I obtained them f Why, with this dreadful weapon, my candlestick ! \" He then informed them of the whole transaction and the laughter became general. At the earliest opportunity the cadet visited his friend, and waggishly introduced the subject, when the victim related his adventure with much confusion. Then the cadet returned the watch and purse and spoke of the brass candlestick, but the jest, instead of being relished, produced the contrary effect. Some angry words ensued, and the cadet, after suggesting a duel, returned to the Academy. Next morning two police -officers came and enquired for \" Gentleman Cadet P ,\" and arrested the practical joker on a charge of committing highway robbery, producing their warrant and the affidavit of Captain F , sworn before two Kentish magistrates, into whose presence they took their prisoner. His explanation of the frolic was clear, but the accuser persisted in his charge, and the young fellow was sent to gaol, where he remained T T"], [348, "654 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. without bail until the assizes, when he was tried as a felon, and condemned to death I Petitions were sent to the King by his agonized friends, and his sentence was com muted to transportation for life. He was sent to Botany Bay, but his deportment gained him the love of all, and he was weR treated, though a convict. Twenty years elapsed, and, having his partial liberty, he amassed a tolerable fortune, when his term of banishment was rescinded and he returned home, where he was received into good society. As to his accuser, his brother officers and aU people of feeling turned their backs upon him in consequence of his vindictive conduct, and, seRing out, he em barked in trade, but failed, and died a beggar. The story shows how serious was the law, and how ill the fame of Shooters' Hill. The \"Hill of Blood.\"\u2014 The name of Shooters' Hill has, indeed, been associated with crimes worse than highway robbery. In tbe reign of Elizabeth it gained the description of \" The Hill of Blood,\" consequent on a particularly wicked murder which created a great sensation in London and the provinces. We have the following par ticulars given us by John Stow: On the 25th of March, 1573, being the Wednesday in Easter week, George Brown cruelly murdered two honest men near unto Shooters' Hill, in Kent ; the one of them was a wealthy merchant of London, named George Sanders, the other John Beane, of Woolwich. On Tuesday the said George Brown, receiving secret intelligence by letter from Mistress Ann Drewry that Master Sanders should lodge that same night in the house of one Master Barnes, of Woolwich, and from thence go on foot to Saint Mary Cray the next morning, lay in wait for him by the way a little from Shooters' Hill, and there slew both him and John Beane, servant to Master Barnes,* but John Beane, having ten or eleven wounds and being left for dead, by God's providence revived again, and, creeping away all four, was found by an old man and his maiden, and taken to Woolwich, where he gave evident marks of the murderer, who was afterwards hanged up in chains near unto the place where he had done the fact. Woolwich in the Drama. \u2014 There was an old play written on the story. Just as Brown and an accomplice named \" Trusty Roger \"* arrive at the murdered man's house, two children are idling at the door : \u2014 Boy. Go to, where shall we play ? Young Sam. Here at our door. Boy. What if your father finds us 1 Young Sam. No, he's at Woolwich and will not come home to-night. Enter Brown and Roger. Roger. How now, captain . Why stop you on the sudden ?

Christ Church. \u2014 Turning to a more modern and more pleasant subject, we see half-way up the hill the picturesque group of Christ Church and Schools. Tbe church has a district formed out of parts of Plumstead, Woolwich, and Eltham. The church, which is in tbe parish of Eltham, was erected in 1854, together with the school buildings adjacent, on a part of tbe War Department ground known as \"The Roughs,\" or Eltham Common.

The service which had originated in the assembly room of the extinct Bull Hotel had been continued in a private house by the Rev. Thomas Dallin, who was appointed first incumbent of the church. The Rev. J. S. Masters succeeded him in 1865. The services are choral, and there is a fine organ by Robson. Shooters' Hill Church and Schools, 1876, Cottage Hospital. \u2014 A recent and gratifying event connected with Shooters' Hill has been the establishment of tbe Woolwich and Plumstead Cottage Hospital on part of the government plantation north of the high road. This work originated and was mainly accomplished by Mr. William Woodford, and the building was erected from designs by Mr. J. 0. Cook in 1889, by a public subscription raised to celebrate tbe Royal Jubilee of 1887. On Sept. 7th, 1889, the memorial stone was laid by H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge in the presence of a great assembly of people."], [351, "Geological Section of Shooters' Hill and District. CHAPTER LI ROUND SHOOTERS' HILL Springs and Valleys. \u2014 Before the streams begat the footpaths the hills created the streams, and all the undulations which form tbe physical features of the country round about us owe their origin more or less to the influence of the watershed of Shooters' Hill. Its springs at one time fed many\" rivulets, which are now dried up or diverted underground, leaving us only the little valleys which were their beds. Several of these have been mentioned, such as tbe watercourse which flowed down Woolwich Common and formed the dell of the \" Seven Sisters,\" the only remaining evidences of which are the contour of the ground and, perchance, the testimony of some old map or writing. The necessities of modern life have turned most of these ancient rills into sewers, and more than one have thus disappeared under the trans forming band of man even in our day. Nightingale Brook. \u2014 Witness the extermination of the ever running stream which, as lately as 1854 or thereabout, made music under the hedges by the grassy side of Brookhill Road ! This small river came into being amid the swampy waste behind the Royal Military Academy (the overpouring, doubtless, of the mineral wells just debated), where, in spite of drainage, the moisture still oozes out of the Shooters' Hill soil. The whole hill is a mass of this dark sea-mud (commonly known as the \"London clay\"), lodged on the terrace of gravel which we call the Commons of Plumstead, Woolwich, and Blackheath, and crowned with a cap of foreign gravel, perched (pos sibly by some giant iceberg) on its very head. Shooters' Hill is known to be \"full of water,\" and the springs cast forth from its clayey fountains have for all ages sluiced the valleys"], [352, "658 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. with streams. Even the springs which we see trickling down the remotest dip of Plumstead Common have this source, and the water which once supplied the whole town of Woolwich from the conduit at Conduit Road may be traced to the same cause. But the Brookhill watercourse was above ground and palpable. It trickled across Red Lion Lane just below the iron chapel, and, passing behind the enclosure of the non-commissioned officers' quarters (where are the remains of an extinct road), it descended the ravine of the once delightful Night- ingale Vale. Gathering strength as it flowed, the streamlet splashed across tbe foot of Fox Hill, naming the road \" Ditchwater Lane,\" and then swept along the eastern side of Brookhill Road, leaving its name there also, and probably baptising in like manner the \" Water \" (or \"Waterman's\") Fields. Then through the sandpits behind New Road, it created yet another ford (crossed by a foot-bridge*) as it passed over Plumstead Road into the Arsenal, where it filled a moat about a barbacan, and finally fell into the bosom of Father Thames. A Reservoir. \u2014 The valley of this brook is still to be seen in several places, but the brook itself was drained away into the sewers thirty years ago. It bad been passed in culverts under the roads long before, and it is as far away as 1740 1 that we see the foot-bridge crossing the Plumstead Road ; but that the inhabitants kept it purposely in view and turned it to practical account is seen by tbe reservoir in the map of 1800,+ which stood just on the site of the Anglesea Arms at the corner of Waterman's Fields. Below this spot the stream vanished early in the century, when the Ordnance sewer was constructed for the purpose of draining the Barracks, and the engineers annexed it for flushing purposes ; but every middle-aged native remembers it rippling past Sir Edward Perrott's park, and gurgling down from the hiU beyond. The Border Line. \u2014 This is the brook which constituted the primi tive boundary mark between Woolwich and Plumstead, and, with only a few eccentric variations, the boundary still follows its ancient line.\u00a7 The Lord Clyde Tavern and other houses adjacent in Brookhill Road were built over the brook and the greensward, and are consequently in both parishes. This waterway may well be cited on behalf of the theory which attributes so many old roads and footpaths to the course of streams, for a roadway undoubtedly pursued its almost entire length. Boundary of Charlton.\u2014 The same may be said of the companion bourn which went down Woolwich Common, and through the Lower Wood Street valley, before it was swallowed up in another Government * Illustration next title page. t Plan of East Woolwich, page 40.

This, too, formed a border line, being the boundary of Charlton, now very considerably distorted. Boundary Of Plumstead. \u2014 Plumstead also has a water boundary on its outer edge, and it still remains visible and active, tbe only existing rivulet we have on the north of all tbe many affluents of Shooters' Hill. This is the brook over which we pass by a bridge at the foot of Bostall Hill, occupying the centre of the valley which was, in earlier days, the bed of a tidal river.* It may be followed along the eastern base of Shooters' Hill into Eltham, at which place it is shown as a river in some of the old maps. The Slade. \u2014 It is unnecessary to enumerate all the descents by which the drainage from Shooters' Hill reaches the Thames, but I may remark that by far the largest area of rainfall gathers towards the Slade, on Plumstead Common, which, though sewered, still becomes an open watershed during heavy storms. Source Of the River Quaggy. \u2014 One more attribute of Shooters' Hill must be mentioned, especially as, I believe, it has not been noticed The Source of a River. or pointed out by any one. Shooters' Hill is the source of a true river, not a large or important one, but, nevertheless, a real existing river, which flows through Lee, and, after uniting with the Ravensbourne at Lewisham, drops into Deptford Creek and joins the Thames. This stream may be seen to rise in springs at tbe back of the Shooters' Hill police-station, to pass under the Eltham road by an arched bridge, and descend the Kidbrook Fields, crossing Kidbrook Lane, gaining bulk as it meanders through the Lee meadows, and becoming a res- * Page 494 and 531."], [354, "660 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. pectable river by tbe time it reaches Lee Bridge. It is here known by the unpoetic name of \"The Quaggy,\" probably from the swampy pastures on its route ; and, even towards its source, its ancient designa tion, \" The Ket,\" has been lost. The farm folk of Kidbrook speak of \" the brook \" only, forgetting that the brook was the \" Ket brook,\" which gave its name to all that quarter. The Chalk Scarp. \u2014 In addition to its streams, many other natu ral features of the locality are ascribable to tbe slope of Shooters' Hill. The abrupt fall which ends it as it approaches the Thames \u2014 and seen at Hanging Wood, Plumstead Common, and elsewhere \u2014 will be shown by tbe diagram at p. 657 to have resulted from a rupture in the under lying crust of chalk. The River Thames itself appears to have been thus created, the fault in tbe chalk having produced the valley through which it flows. On these subjects the reader may profitably consult the works of our friend, Mr. Wil iam Topley, whose eminence as a geologist, and especially in his Wealden researches, have done honour to his birthplace, Woolwich. Geological causes have, however, had other influences on the locality than the shaping of its physical features, and it may not be out of place to show what is under our feet.

Water Supply. \u2014 One advantage which we derive from our super abundant chalk is an excellent water supply. Until 1852, the Kent Company, like other water companies, obtained its supply from a river, tbe Ravensbourne, and with tbe river they had tbe usual impu rities. But the inhabitants of Woolwich and Plumstead (and we may add Charlton) were aware of the chalk outcrop in their district, and at a certain moderate depth they knew they should come upon water, ample and pure. They therefore started their own waterworks, and bored a well at Plumstead, whereupon the Kent Company, with much astuteness, sunk a rival well into the chalk at Deptford with the bene volent object of draining Plumstead dry. They succeeded in getting plenty of water, but they made not the slightest difference to the Plumstead well, and they were only too glad when the chance came of buying, instead of drying, it up. The lesson, however, had been learned, and now tbe chalk yields, in many places and in great abun dance, the healthy water we drink. Plumstead Water Works. \u2014 The story of the Plumstead, Wool wich, and Charlton Pure Water Company is not a happy memory. On Monday, July 31, 1854, the directors and the shareholders of the company, which had been but a short time in existence, assembled in high glee at the newly formed works in Ann Street, Plumstead, to witness the first filling of tlie reservoirs preliminary to commencing the public supply. There were present most of the lead ing men of the district, Mr. Lewis Davis, the chairman of the company (and owner of the land) presiding. There was a dejeuner at which toasts were given and speeches made, and the guests all tasted the water, and something else. Everybody rejoiced that the three parishes were to become independent of the Kent Company, and delighted at the plentiful spring rising out of the chalk ; but there was, unhappily, a skeleton in the cupboard, and it did not come out. The funds were never subscribed, and Mr. Lewis Davis, six years afterwards, bought the whole concern for ,\u00a320,400, and, the district being slow to redeem its property, sold it to the rival Kent Company within a month. From the wells of the old Plumstead company the Kent company obtained the best of the water which has established its reputation. Revealed Strata. \u2014 There are good opportunities of studying the chalk formation at Charlton Pits and Wickham Lane, and tbe section of the fault as seen in the excavation made for the railway at St. John's Station should be noticed. These faults are occasioned by the outcrop having at some time been broken across and left at different levels. The lower fault in our diagram follows almost exactly tbe line of the Greenwich and Woolwich Lower Road, and therefore forms the edge of the marsh \u2014 tbe ancient river-margin. The \" Woolwich Beds.\" \u2014 Geologists are well acquainted with the \" Woolwich Beds,\" so named because the best sections are here"], [356, "662 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. disclosed, but actually extending for many miles. The Thanet and tbe Reading beds (similarly named) are also well seen in the outcrops at Charlton, Woolwich, and Plumstead, and there is another good section in the road leading up from Abbey Wood Station to Bostall Heath. The influence of geology as a factor in modifying vegetable life is also to be remarked at Bostall Hill, the flourishing state of tbe pine wood on the summit being attributed to the sandy soil. The Woolwich beds consist of laminated clay, full of shells, a carbonaceous clay, containing lignite intermixed with sand, and clayey limestone. Over these are the Oldhaven and Blackheath gravels, which may be studied in the escarpments of Bostall and Plumstead Commons. The latter has the pebbles sixty feet thick.

At the Conquest. \u2014 Beginning with Domesday Book (see page 8) we find that Charlton was held in the time of Edward tbe Confessor by two brothers, named Godwin and Aluard, but after the Conquest it was given, with tbe rest of bis prizes, to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who was balf-brotber to William I. and was created by him Earl of Kent. It was attached to tbe Priory of Bermondsey until tbe Dis solution, and passed through various hands, until it was purchased in 1607 by the great Sir Adam Newton. A Royal Manor. \u2014 In the Rolls of Parliament there is a record of tbe manor of Charlton being assigned by an act in jointure to Eliza beth, Queen of Henry VII. Charlton is spelt in these rolls variously as Cbelrton, Cheorleton, Cherleton, Cberlton and Cborleton. The Name. \u2014 The origin of the name is doubtless ceorle, tbe Saxon term for husbandman, and ton, a town. Ceorl (from which charl and churl) meant a man, a husband and also a busbandman. It also meant a freeman, and was apparently tbe mas culine gender of tbe generic \"man.'' Ceorl-boren was country-born. Tbe term was also used to signify low birth ; ccorl-folc were the common folk, and ceorl-cynge was king of the commons. Karl in the Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic, and kerl in tbe German, have gone through the same gradations."], [362, "664 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The common suffix ton, or town, was at one time applied to any kind of enclosure \u2014 the husbandman's homestead standing alone, or in a garden fenced off from the waste, being each described as a ton or tun, which in time got applied to a cluster of cottages, a village, and all kinds of human settlements under the Anglo-Saxons. Tbe simple meaning of Charlton, therefore, is a country place or village. King James and Sons. \u2014 Charlton has on more than one occasion been a Royal residence. King James I. dates several of bis warrants and edicts from Charlton. It may have been some other place of the same name, of which there are in England just twenty-two, but it is an article of faith in the Wilson family that his Majesty actually dwelt at Charlton House, and tbe ceiling of tbe principal saloon is adorned not only witb the plume of the Prince of Wales, but also witb the Royal Arms of England. At any rate, James had a special interest in tbis same Charlton, for it was bere that his son Henry, the much-beloved Prince of Wales, and bis second son, the unfortunate Charles, were educated. King James had granted the manor to John, Earl of Mar, who in 1606 sold it for \u00a32,000 to Sir James Erskine, by whom it was transferred in tbe follow ing year to Sir Adam Newton for the sum of \u00a34, -500. Sir Adam not only built the noble manor-house,* which is now the seat of the Wilson family, but he also in great measure rebuilt the church. Prince Henry. \u2014 With Sir Adam Newton, Henry, Prince of Wales, here spent a considerable portion of his short life. The young prince had a brave and noble character, and his premature death is the more to be regretted because it placed the crown on the weak and hapless head of Charles, and brought forth a disastrous series of events. Newton, though a disciplinarian, encouraged the youthful spirit of his royal pupil, and an amusing incident of this is recounted. One July day the two were seated in a recess,f which we still see overlooking tbe breezy valley of the Thames, and playing at shuffle-board. \"Well thrown, sir,\" cried the prince, in a tone of banter, at a move of the game by his opponent. Master Newton bit his lip and replied, \" I will strive no more with a prince at shuffle-board.\" \"And yet yon gownsmen should be best at such exercises, being no meet for those more stirring,\" quietly answered the prince. \" Yes,\" said Sir Adam, \"meet for whipping boys.\" * The architect was the famous Inigo Jones. On the outer walls of the stable buildings are Adam Newton's initials, \" A.N.,\" in iron letters. t The recess forms a dais or platform in the west window of the saloon, many times since used as a stage or platform for private entertainments."], [363, "665 OLD CHARLTON. \" You need not vaunt that,\" the other replied ; \" that any ploughman can do better than you.\" \" I can do more,\" retorted the angry tutor, \" I can govern foolish children.\" Thereupon, seeing the good man was disturbed, the prince turned to others present and said, with a smile, \"He had need be wise himself who can do that.\" The Prince and the Butcher. \u2014 At another time the prince was out with a gay party hunting the stag over the waste land about Charlton, when the hind, leaping a boundary fence, was dragged down and killed by a butcher's dog. The dog's master, seeing no one by, seized the venison, and was making off with his prize when the prince and his party rode up. Some of the attendants rated the fellow in round terms, and the prince bade them refrain. \"If thy royal father had been here,\" said they, \"he would have sworn the fellow off his feet.\" \" My friends,\" replied the amiable young prince, \" all the pleasures of the world are not worth a vain oath.\" Prince Henry's Wit. \u2014 Once when amus ing himself with golf Henry was about to strike tbe ball, when his A Staircase at Charlton House. tutor came within the swing of his club. A bystander exclaimed, \" Beware, sir, that you do not hit Mr. Newton.\" The prince, with reminiscences of the rod, replied in an undertone, \" Had I done so I had but paid my debts.\" His love of active amusements drew forth the remark from the king that his brother Charles would outstrip him in learning. When Henry beard of this, he observed, \" Well, then, I will make brother Charles Archbishop of Canterbury.\" It is supposed that Henry died a foul death, and a life full of promise was severed at the early age of seventeen.* \u2022 For more of Prince Henry, see Eecords of Woolwich Dockyard, pp. 229-246."], [364, "666 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Old Church.\u2014 Sir Adam Newton died January 13, 1629,* before be could accomplish bis wish to restore the church, which was, however, performed with money left by him for the purpose. This was done, observes Phillipot, by Sir David Cunningham, Knight and Bart., late cofferer to Prince Charles, Mr. James Newton, his brother, and Mr. Peter Newton, gentleman usher to Prince Charles, who have most amply discharged the trust, and in a manner new built a great part thereof, and erected the steeples new from the ground, and furnished with a new ring of bells, decorating the said church without and within that it surpasses most in the shire. The church is more fully dealt with in the following chapter The Charlton Estates. \u2014 The Charlton Manor came into posses sion of the Wilson family from the Maryons, who removed hither from Paxhill in Sussex. The descent was in this wise : \u2014 Sir Henry Newton^ (second son of Sir Adam), who had taken the name of Puckering, aliened the Charlton Manor in 1659 to Sir Wilham, second son of Sir Richard Ducie, the banker of King Charles I. Sir William was made Knight of the Bath at the coronation of King Charles II. , was afterwards raised to the peerage as Viscount Downe, and died here in 1679. His representatives in 1680 sold the estate to Sir William Langhorne, Bart.,\u00a7 who by his will entailed this and other estates upon his nephew (son of hi3 sister) and heir, Sir John Conyers, Bart, and his heirs male, which failing by the death of Sir Baldwin Conyers and his son without * Sir Adam Newton had charge and education of Prince Charles after the death of Prince Henry. His allowance was -\u00a3200 tor the lives of himself and his wife, and a gift of \u00a3300 in 1604 from the royal purse. But he died wealthy, having the privilege of certain tenements in the Tower, and being made Clerk of the Council in 1628 at a salary of \u00a32,000 a year. He was appointed Dean of Durham in 1606, and was created baronet in 1620. By his will he left \u00a325 to Charlton and \u00a320 each to Greenwich, Deptford and Woolwich for the poor. Horace Walpole conjec- tures that only the great gate of Charlton House was the work of Inigo Jones. Dr. Drake, however, inclines to the belief that this genius designed the whole struc- ture, and it is locally believed that he resided during the progress of the work at the cottage which he built in the Cherry Orchard. [I am indebted to Dr. Drake for permission to quote these and many other particulars from that valuable work, \" Hasted 's History of Kent, corrected, enlarged and continued to the present time from the MS. collections of the late Rev.

Here is a faire monument in black marble of Sir Adam Newton, who built that faire house neere it for Prince Henry, and where my noble friend Sir Henry Newton succeeded him.\" On the 9th of June, 1653, Evelyn further writes :\u2014 \" Went to visite my worthy neighbour, Sir Henry Newton (at Charlton), and consider the prospect, which is doubtless for city, river, ships, meadows, hill, woods and other amenities, one of the most noble in the world : so as, had the house running water, it were a princely seate.\" This is high praise coming from the sage of beautiful Wotton. \u00a7 In 1690, according to \" Index Villarus,\" there were in Charlton but two persons entitled to rank as gentlemen, one of whom was a baronet and probably Sir William Langhorne ; the other we may conclude was the rector.

John Maryon, rector of White Roding, who devised them to his niece, Margaretta Maria (only daughter of his sister Mary by her husband, William Peers, Esq.). Margaretta was the wife of John Badger Weller, Esq., of Horn church, in Romford, Essex, and after his death she married John Jones, Esq., of Ireland.* The estates at her decease fell to her only daughter, Jane, the wife of Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson, Bart., sixth Baronet, in whose family they have since remained. The Wilsons of Old.\u2014 The pedigree of the family is a long and honourable one. One of the most distinguished of the line was Dr. Thomas Wilson, lawyer and physician and afterwards Dean of Durham. He was greatly honoured by Queen Elizabeth, who made him a Secretary of State. He died in 1581. \"Master John Wilson, Esquire,\" settled at Searles, in the parish of Fletching, Sussex, in 1589.

Ainonc the ablest of the race was Sir John Maryon Wilson, Bart., who resided at Charlton House in 1704, and, as we learn from a commission on historical MSS., has left a goodly collection relating to his ancestor Dr. Wilson, secretary to Queen Elizabeth, and a variety of subjects.

The Wilsons of To-day. \u2014 Coming to our own times we have bad \u2014 Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson who died in 1869, wearing the uniform of a West Kent Volunteer. He was the eighth baronet ; he died unmarried, and was the last of the race who was buried in the vault at Charlton Church. His brother, Sir John Maryon Wilson, who succeeded him, died in 1874, leaving his son, Sir Spencer \"Maryon Maryon-Wilson, who now holds the title and estates. Tbe pedigree of the family dates from 1250, and there are enumerated fifteen successive heads prior to the baronetcy. Sir Spencer is tenth baronet.t Charlton House. \u2014 The Rev. Charles Swainson, M.A., Rector of Charlton, thus describes Charlton House : \u2014 The mansion is very pleasantly situated, and affords one of the best specimens extant of the domestic style of architecture and building which prevailed during the reign of James I. Originally commenced in 1607, from the designs of Inigo Jones, it was completed in 1612. It is constructed of red brick with stone architraves to tbe doors and window's, and stone coigns, forming an oblong, with projections at the end of each front, surmounted by two lofty turrets (one of which contains a clock), and an open balustrade along the summit of the west front, whose centre, containing a richly decorated porch, also projects. This porch, which is entirely of stone, is ornamented with arabesque pilasters and columns of the Corinthian order, while above it is a niche containing the bust of a female figure. X The spacious entrance hall, which is oak-panelled and furnished with a minstrels' gallery of somewhat later date at the western end, has its walls and roof decorated, and conspicuous with the crest and monogram of Sir Wilham Ducie (first Viscount Downe, who in 1659 made considerable alterations to the house), also with the Prince of Wales's plume and monogram. A vestibule at the north-west corner leads to the grand staircase, at the bottom of which are the dining room and chapel. The dining room, a very handsome apartment, has its north side overlooking the garden, and forming a kind of arcade, separated from the room by a row of marble columns with semi-circular arches. Adjoining the dining room, and separated from it by folding doors, is the chapel, which appears, by the original document under the hand and seal of John * Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson, of Charlton, in August, 1798, was Colonel of the 50th Regiment of Foot (now the Queen's Own Royal AVest Kent Regiment). t The Lord of the Manor has not always occupied Charlton House, having other estates in Sussex and Essex. John, Earl of Egmont, resided here for many years and formed a valuable library (1742). He is buried, with many of his race, in the old church. The Marquis ot Lothian occupied the house at a later date.

The subjects in the north window are the Annunciation and the Nativity ; those in the west being the Agony in the Garden, the Falling of our Blessed Lord on the way to the Cross, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, the Ascension, and the Descent of tbe Holy Spirit. The upper floors are reached by the spacious and richly ornamented staircase of chestnut, its arabesque balusters being surmounted by capitals of the Tuscan, Ionic and Corinthian orders, and also by the armorial bearings of the Wilson family. The principal state apart ments are situated upon the second floor. The first of these, which is entered from the great staircase, is the gallery (on the north side of the house), which was fitted up by Sir Adam Newton, containing many curious and interesting objects of natural history, minerals, fossils, insects, &c, chiefly brought together by Lady Wilson, but aug- mented by the late Sir Thomas Wilson during his travels in the North and South of Europe, and also a valuable collection of old china. It measures 76 ft. by 16 ft. and extends the whole depth of the building. In the room adjoining the gallery, called the north sitting room, the ceiling of which is also very rich, is a most elaborately carved chimney piece, representing the story of Medusa, beneath which are two allegorical bassi relievi. From this room we enter the saloon, 48 ft. by 22 ft., lighted at either end by large mullioned windows : in the ceiling of the western recess are the royal arms of James I., the ostrich feathers (the cognisance of the Prince of Wales) occupying a similar position opposite. The chimney-piece in tbis room is of unusually large dimensions, and has on one side a figure in oriental alabaster of Vulcan, and on the other of Venus. The ceiling, which is in its original state as finished by Sir Adam Newton, is enriched with arabesque ornamentation, intermixed with fruit and flowers, and decorated with elaborate pendants. In the room next entered, called the south sitting room, is a Fireplace in Charlton House. chimney-piece with a slab of black marble in wliich Lord Downe is said to have seen the reflection of a robbery committed at Blackheath. The present possessor, Sir Spencer Maryon Wilson, has caused the entire building to be thoroughly repaired and restored as nearly as possible to its original condition, and has also added a billiard room and other apartments in keeping with the rest of the mansion. In a recent tour of the house, under escort of Sir Spencer M. Wilson, I have been able to verify the testimony of Mr. Swainson relative to tbe care which has been taken not to impair the venerable features of tbe place by \" restorations.\" A whole volume might be written upon tbe interesting mansion and its curious contents, but our present TJ V"], [368, "670 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. limits forbid further enlargement of the subject. I ought to mention, however, the two young reindeer, which I do not think have ever been publicly noticed. They were imported alive from the Arctic regions during the time of the late Sir Thomas Wilson, and were said to have been the first acclimatised in England, but unfortunately they both met their deatbs by accidents. They are stuffed and preserved in a glass case. A Roman Relic. \u2014 Another curiosity is a very large and well formed Roman vase, which is stated to have been discovered in Hang ing Wood. Cypress Trees. \u2014 -The cypress trees in Charlton Park are believed to be the oldest in the kingdom. (.See note, page 680.) Legends of Charlton. \u2014 At Charlton House is preserved a declara tion as to one of the misfortunes which has afflicted tbe family. It describes \u2014 A dream by a gentleman in Devonshire (several days before the event) three times in one night, in which he seemed to see the act of assassination and the place of it. On going to London after the news came down he recognised, from inspection, the place, the murderer and his victim, and the dresses worn by them at the time. Of equal historical value are other of tbe records of Charlton. It is because they are records, and not because they are true records, that they find a place here. The following is mentioned in Mr. Swainson's account, at page 669. Once upon a time, so the story goes, Lord Downe, who dwelt at Charlton House in the reign of Charles II. (from 16-59 until 1679), was seated at the great fireplace of black marble, which is always kept polished like a mirror, when he saw the reflection of some villains engaged in a robbery on the Heath.* He called his servants and despatched them with such promptitude that they arrested tbe ruffians and brought them to justice. Horn Fair. \u2014 Another and much older tradition relates to the origin of Charlton Fair,t which, after a long existence and disreputable old age, expired under a load of sins in 1872. Where the great tree stands opposite the old church, it is said, there once stood a mill, and in the mill dwelt a burly miller and his dainty wife. In one of his hunting excursions Blackheath is generally described as the scene of this adventure, but, as it is more than a. mile off, the assumption is preposterous. De Plot, in one of his MSS., says that the robbery took place on Shooters' Hill, and if we include in the hill the upper part ol \\\\ oolwich Common, which stretched nearly to Charlton House, we may brin\" tlie story within range of belief. t A weekly market was held at Charlton on Mondays, uniler a grant from Henry III. (a.d. 1220) to the monks of Bermondsey, who had possession of the Manor from the eleventh century."], [369, "671 OLD CHARLTON*. from Eltham, King John is supposed to have entered the mill for refreshment, and, surprising the young wife alone, he is presumed to have made love with such indiscretion that he did not notice the return of the miller. The infuriated husband threatened the life of the intruder, and, to save his skin, the king discovered himself, and satisfied the miller with a promise to give him all the land he could see from the mill-door. This, according to the story, made him lord of a manor stretching from Cuckold's Point at Rotherhithe to Woolwich town. Tbe fair is said to have been established by charter. Its name, \" Horn Fair, \" is attributed by Phillipot, in his \" Villiare Cantianum\" (1659), to \" the plenty of Winding-Horns, and cups, and other vessels of horn, there brought to be sold.\" The inn at the corner of the fair-ground was called the Horns, and is now the Bugle Horn. The origin of the term, whatever it may have been, was undoubtedly associated by the vulgar with the flimsy legend from a remote date. At one time the revellers who frequented the fair adorned their heads with horns, and processions came down from London to open the revel. The people, we are told, wearing horns upon their heads, would walk three times round the church, on tbe green in front of which the shows were erected and the sports were held. The Fair in the Olden Time. \u2014 Horn Fair is mentioned by many early writers. It was always held on St. Luke's Day, October 18th, and the two days following, and its name was apparently as old as its existence. Hentzner, a foreigner travelling in England in the year 1598, mentions horns having been con spicuously displayed in its neighbourhood at that period : \u2014 Horn Fair Procession. From an old ballad. Upon taking the air down the river (from London), on the left hand lies Ratcliffe, a considerable suburb. On the opposite shore is fixed a long pole with ram's horns upon it, the intention of which was said to be a vulgar reflection upon the founder ot Horn Fair. The same writer remarks : \u2014 It was the ancient custom for a procession to go from some ofthe inns in Bishopsgate Street, in which procession were a king, a queen, a miller, a counsellor, &c, and a great number of others with horns on their hats. This was accompanied by so many impro prieties on the way that it gave rise to the proverb of \" All is fair at Horn Fair.\" IT V 2"], [370, "672 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. A curious biographical memoir (\"Life of Wm. Fuller,\" 1703) refers to the custom of men going to Horn Fair in women's clothes. I rememl >er being there upon Horn Fair day ; I was dressed in my landlady's best gown and other women's attire, and to Horn Fair we went, and as we were coming back by water all the cloathes were spoiled by dirty water, &c, that was flung on us in an inundation, for which I was obliged to present her with two guineas to make atonement for the damages sustained. Mr. Brand, who cites these notices, and observes that Grose mentions this fair, adds that \u2014 It consists of a riotous mob, who, after a printed summons dispersed through the adjacent towns, meet at Cuckold's Point, near Deptford, end march from thence in procession through that town and Greenwich to Charlton, with horns of different kinds upon their heads ; and at the fair there are sold rams' horns, and every sort of toy made of horn ; even the gingerbread figures have horns. The same recorder of customs mentions the tradition assigning the origin of tbis fair to a grant from King John, which he very properly remarks is \" too ridiculous to merit tbe smallest attention.\" Mr. Brand a Ids : \u2014 \u25a0 A sermon is preached at Charlton Church on the fair-day. This sermon was afterwards discontinued : the practice was created by a bequest of twenty shillings a year to the minister of the parish for preaching it.* The Name of Horn Fair.\u2014 Hone's \"Everyday Book\" of 1827 says :\u2014 The horn-bearing at this fair may be conjectured to have originated from the sym bol accompanying the figure of St. Luke : when he is represented by sculpture or painting, he is usually in the act of writing, with an ox or a cow by his side, whose horns are conspicuous. These seem to have been seized by the former inhabitants of Charlton on the day of the saint's festival, as a lively mode of sounding forth their rude pleasure for the holiday. Though most of the painted glass in the windows of the church was destroyed during the troubles in the time of Charles I., yet many frag ments remain of St. Luke's ox with wings on his back, and goodly horns upon his head ; indeed, with the exception of two or three armorial bearings, and a few cherubs' heads, these figures of St. Luke's horned symbol which escaped destruction, and are carefully placed in the upper part of the windows, are the only painted glass remain ing ; save also, however, that in the east window there are the head and shoulders ot the saint himself and the same parts of the figure of Aaron. The same writer says : \u2014 The procession of horns, customary at Charlton Fair, has ceased ; + but horns still continue to be sold from the lowest to the best booth in the fair. They are chiefly those of sheep, goats, and smaller animals, and are usually gilt and decorated for their less innocent successors to these ornaments. The fair is still a kind of carnival or * Dr. Warren was paid but 6s. 8d. for this service in 1723. See page 694. t Lysons says the procession did not take place after 1786."], [371, "673 OLD CHARLTON. masquerade. On St. Luke's Day, 1825, though the weather was unfavourable to the customary humours, most of the visitors wore masks ; several were disguised in women's clothes, and some assumed whimsical characters. The spacious and celebrated \" Crown and Anchor \" booth was the principal scene of their amusements. The fair is now held in a private field : formerly it was on the green opposite the church, and facing the mansion of Sir Thomas Wilson. The late Lady Wilson was a great admirer and patroness of the fair ; the old lady was accustomed to come down with her attendants every morning during the fair, \" and in long order go \" from the steps of her ancient hall to without the gates of her court-yard, where the bands of the different shows hailed her appearance as a signal to strike up their melody of discords. Richardson always pitched his great booth in front of the house. Latterly, however, the fair has diminished ; Richardson was not there in 1825, nor were there any shows of conse quence. \" Horns ! horns ! \" was the customary and chief cry, and the mostconspicuous Opening Horn Fair, 1745. From a painting. source of frolic : they were in the hat and bonnet of almost every person in the rout, A few years ago it was usual for neighbouring gentry to proceed thither iu their car riages during the morning to see the sports. Horn and Ladle. \u2014 A pamphlet of 1700, written in the coarse style allowed at the period, speaks of the ladle as another fashionable article at the fair, and describes the purpose to which it was put. The writer says : \u2014 Every fool was become a Tom Ladle, and we had to arm ourselves with ladles as a protection from the rabble's insolence, who were afterwards as civil as could be expected, and let us pass with a little knock on the elbow not much harder than"], [372, "674 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. woidd crack a filbert. The fair stands near the church, and, though it is the rudest fair in England, it begins with a sermon. All that is sold at the Fair of use are shooes, pattins, and leather-breeches, the rest are horn-toys and fool's-baubles. The whole place is a commonwealth, where the rabble make laws, and all that approach must keep 'em. Tt is an ill place for a proud man to walk with his arms akimbo, for they have more spight against the elbows than any other part of the body. He that brings money to this fair must look after his pockets. Here is a great deal of furmity to be sold, but few people that buy any. Here are a great many thieves, but few that have any to lose, and abundance of beggars, but few or none to relieve 'em. The fair seems to stand bounded between God and the Devil, for the church stands at one end, and a musick-house at t'other. Another Source. \u2014 The anonymous author of Pasquil's Nightcap, published in 1612, discredits tbe supposed connection between the fair and tbe horns of tbe ox which symbolise tbe patron St. Luke, and does not mention the legend of King John, but creates a whimsical origin for the revel, viz., that the followers of AVat Tyler, who \u2014 Escap'd the halter and the fatall tree, were punished by Dame Fortune, for destroying her temple at Cuckold's Point, by having to wear tails \u2014 Cover'd with haire, which growing pendent down, Shew'd like the taile of Munckie or Babowne. And\u2014 The least was longer than an oxe's taile, At length a compassionate sprite advised the long-tailed Kentish men to propitiate tbe Dame by erecting a pillar or post in her honour on the site of her temple. Accordingly the long-tails mustered at Canterbury ; some \u2014 In comely sort theer foreheads did adorne With goodly coronets of hardy horn ; and the bells of Faversham, Sittingbourne, and other Kentish towns rang out in honour of a procession that passed through Rochester, Gravesend, and Dartford, on its way \u2014 At Cuckold's Haven to erect the post. * * * * Just in the place where Fortune's Temple stood There stands the forked pillar, stout and tall. * * * * Thus was this famous monument extolled, And on the fruitfull bankes of Thames erected, Wliich when the goddesse Fortune did behold Perceiving how devout they her respected ! Her anger vanisht, and with gracious eye, Shee took compassion on their malady ; And all their forms, so infamous before, Unto their pristine beauty did restore ! As the tails fell off they rooted in the ground and were changed into"], [373, "675 OLD CHARLTON. willow-trees, which so delighted the Kentishmen that their joyous cries shook London Bridge and C\u00e6sar's Tower at Dover; and they enacted \u2014 * * * * that for ever once a yeare On St. Luke's Day, they should assemble there, To feast and frollicke on those pleasant bankes, And give to Fortune her deserved thanks. Long time this solomne custome was observed And Kentish men with others met to feast But later times are from old fashions swerved And grown repugnant to this good behest. For now ungrateful men these meetings scorn And thanklesse prove to Fortune and the horn, For only now is kept a poor goose-fair Where none but meaner people do repair. Even in 1612 Horn Fair seems to have fallen in esteem. Evil Prosperity. \u2014 The fair, however, was once more at the height of its popularity in tbe middle of the eighteenth century, and degenerated only in its character, not in its attractions, so long as it was permitted to survive. Ward thus describes the fair in its \" better days : \" \u2014 It stands near the church to make good the old proverb, viz., \" The nearer the church the farther from God.\" Tho' it's the rudest fair in England it begins with a sermon, which makes another old saying good, viz., \"In the name of the Lord begins all mischief.\" . . . It's good for nothing, as I know on, but to humble the conceit that a proud man may have of his person ; for it's enough to make a man out of love with human shape to behold the folly and rudeness of so many reprobates that were at it. 'Tis a sanctuary for ill manners, a protection for all rudeness, an encouragement of wickedness, a revelling of young libertines, a looking-glass of confusion, hurtful to good manners, and hateful to all good men. The Safest Theory. \u2014 We have seen that neither St. Luke nor Dame Fortune nor the hypothetical miller can be allowed tbe undis puted claim to the title of Horn Fair. There is left the more reason able surmise that it originated as other fairs did, and that the name arose from the custom of selling articles of horn at it. This custom, however, prevailed at most of such gatherings in the olden time, so that a \"horn fair\" may have been but a general term. But none of the ancient authorities, I find, advance so commonplace an explanation. Suggested Source of the Legend. \u2014 It is unnecessary to quote more of the many who have written on this favourite subject, and I will refer again to the traditionary origin of the fair only to sug gest an idea which has occurred to me. King John is said to have given to the man whom he made Lord of the Manor all the land he could see in one direction, and tbe boundary mark was a pair of horns set upon a pole at a place called \" Cuckold's Point.\" This spot was commonly sup posed to be above Deptford, which was contrary to reason, and entirely unsupported by evidence. The manor does not even lie in that direction, and there is nothing to show that it ever did. Bat if we turn to the"], [374, "676 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. early view of Woolwich drawn in 1588 (page 298) we shall see a pair of horns upon a pole. This was probably a mere beacon for mariners, but it is worth remark that to this spot, which is near the site of High Street, Woolwich, tbe estates of tbe Manor of Charlton (somewhat inter rupted) have extended even unto tbis day. Regarding the story as pure invention, I think that this circumstance gives weight to an otherwise empty tradition. The juxtaposition of a pair of horns and the boundary of the manor affords quite as reasonable a foundation as we might expect in a rustic legend. If it were but said, \" Tbe horns at Woolwich are the Cuckold's mark, and the manor stretches thither,\" the rest of the story might naturally develop in the rural mind. I may add that there is in existence an itinerary, showing the where abouts of King John on every day of his seventeen years' reign. I have searched it through and find that it contains no mention either of Charlton, Woolwich or Eltham. Corniculate Masonry. \u2014 It will be seen that the obsolete archway which marks the former entrance and boundary of Charlton House is surmounted by two emblems in stone which seem to represent the cornucopia, or horn of plenty. Can the sculptor have caught tbe per vading influence and given to the horn tbis spiritualised presence as an oblation to the genius of the locality ? The Later Years of Horn Fair. \u2014 Of the later history of Horn Fair we find, from the testimony of various writers, that in the early part of this century the fair was much patronised by tbe better-class people of the district, and splendid carriages with whole families and liveried servants might be seen driving up between two and four o'clock on the first day, and returning laden with gingerbread and cakes, chiefly from the stall of Boniface, a confectioner who had his home in Church Street, Woolwich, and was well known at every fair in England. Very old inhabitants speak of seeing ladies ride to and from the fair on pack-saddles or pillions, and hence perchance the popular rustic ditty : \u2014 As I was a-riding to Horn Fair, So green were the fields and so cold was the air, I met a pretty damsel riding on a grey mare, And I asked this young damsel to take me with her ; \" Oh no, oh no, I cannot, sir, although I much deplore, For my father he will scold me, and will never let me ride on the grey mare any more.\" The Fair Removed. \u2014 The venue was transferred from tbe Green to the Fair-field in 1819 by Sir Thomas Wilson ; his mother, Lady Wilson, who had always venerated the ancient institution, having died in August, 1818. The chief reason assigned was the damage done to the highway by fixing the poles for the booths and shows. But when a"], [375, "A Corner of Horn Fair in 1860. Drawn from a sketch by R. L. Aldridge at the age of ten years. [To face page 076.] PLATE LXVI."], [376, ""], [377, "OLD CHARLTON. 677 heavy snowstorm fell upon the fair in the first year of its new location the popular understanding was that the spirit of the lady resented the innovation. Long after the fair was driven from tbe Green into the Fair-field \u2014 indeed unto the end \u2014 its revelries extended to and almost absorbed the whole village, the taverns providing dancing rooms and other attractions, while most of the cottages supplied food and drink of inoffensive kinds. A Cadet's Pastime. \u2014 The Fair-field was in 1840 the scene of an alarming riot consequent on a conflict between the cadets of the Royal Military Academy and a section of the public. The business, though serious, was not much noised abroad, and I cannot find any allusions to it in tbe papers of the day, other than the report in The Times of a police enquiry at Greenwich before Mr. Grove, on November 5th, 1840. A gentleman cadet was summoned for damaging a stage-carriage belonging to John Matthew Munyard, who claimed \u00a34 10s. Police -Sergeant McGill deposed \u2014 I was in the fair at Algar's booth and saw about fifty of the cadets enter armed with heavy bludgeons, and most of them wearing masks. I was informed that it was the intention ofthe cadets to get up a row that night. They conducted themselves in the booth in a most disgraceful manner ; I was struck vio lently over the hat, and they were beating people indiscriminately. They also knocked down gingerbread and other stalls, and destroyed a considerable portion of the property. Many persons were severely beaten, and I was obliged to send to Woolwich for assistance. Mr. Grove, the magistrate, said \u2014 It is a most respectable and well-conducted fair. I attended with my brother magistrate, Mr. Broughton, who remarked that he con sidered it one of the most respectable fairs in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, and, but for the shameful conduct of these young gentlemen, it would continue to be so. Captain Burnaby, R.A., adjutant of the Academy, said that previously to the fair he had called the cadets together and cautioned them to avoid such disgraceful pro ceedings, upon which occasion as many as seventy bludgeons were delivered up to him. Notwithstanding this they obtained others and armed themselves to do mischief. The defendant, after a severe lecture from the magistrate, was ordered to pay the bill and costs. Colonel Dray son's Tale of Horn Fair. \u2014 In the story of \"The Woolwich Cadet,\" now becoming scarce, Colonel Drayson has the following narrative : \u2014 * Horn Fair day was a kind of Derby Day, at which all the elite of the neighbourhood were to be seen from about two till five on one particular day out of the three that the fair lasted. From the entrance to the fair to the branch roads, where the cemetery is now situated, the carriages used to stand two deep during the time their occupiers strolled about the fair. Since those days, however, the railway has given such facility for the * Colonel Drayson was at the Academy from February 6th, 1843, to August 6th, 1846. It should be observed that his book professes to be a work of fiction."], [378, "678 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. east end of London to send down its unwashed hundreds, that first the fair was deserted by the ladies of the neighbourhood, next by the gentlemen, and finally was done away with as being detrimental to the neighbourhood. During the three days that the fair lasted the cadet company were confined to the enclosure, and were not allowed to visit the village of Charlton. Such a restriction was ordered on account of a row which some years previously had occurred between the cadets and some of the fair people ; but it was very obnoxious to the old cadets, and particularly to one who had been reduced from the rank of Corporal to that of cadet. This individual had a great deal of influence among the seniors, and on the morning of the second day of the fair he paid a visit to the majority of the rooms, in order to ventilate his ideas and organise a plan he had in his mind for the evening. The cadet, who was named Prosser, came to our room to see Forester, and said, \" Don't you think it's an awful shame to confine us to barracks like a set of school boys, instead of trusting us to go to the fair i I want your opinion about it, Forester.\" \" Well,\" replied Forester, \" I think it's bad taste, and a mistake, for it seems to say, 'If you go to the fair you will get into a row,' but I don't see what's the use of complaining.\" \" I'll tell you what the use is,\" said Prosser, \" I've got a lot of fellows who are game to fall in after tea, and go straight away to the fair \u2014 that is, if everyone will go. You see, if everybody goes they can't break a few fellows only, and they can't pitch into everybody, and I believe they will see it won't do to shut us up like sheep, but that we shall get more liberty.\" \" I won't join,\" said Forester, \" if I can help it, and I think it's not the right way to go to work to remeily a grievance.\" During that afternoon a paper was passed round the Academy, saying'that the whole of the first and second class would fall in on the centre parade at half-past eight, and ilouble off to the fair, and the third and fourth class were to fall in at the same hour and place. This came as a kind of order from the old cadets, and we all signed our names as willing to agree to go. Everything was kept very quiet during the afternoon, for fear the authorities might hear of the plot, and at half-past eight every cadet fell in quietly on the grass inside the Academy, and, the words of command being whispered from file to file, we broke into a double, and ran across the common towards Charlton. There were present on that occasion every cadet except the eight corporals on duty, who thought they were bound in honour not to leave their posts. This was a sort of compromise with duty, for these eight corporals were per fectly aware that the break-out of barracks was going to be attempted, and had they done their duty they would have reported this, and put a stop at once to the affair ; but the moral courage to do so was wanting. Still none of these cadets liked to leave their posts, \u2014 an indication of the right feeling that prevailed at that time in many things at the Academy, and at the same time a proof of the inconsistency in the ideas of the cadets. Forester declined to join the \"mutiny,\" as it might be termed, on principle, but he left Fenton and myself to do as we liked, and we both went. The \" cadet company,\" as I might term it, having got well clear of the Academy and across the common, came to a quick march, and the word was then passed down the ranks as to our proceedings at the fair. On nearing the fair we were to form four deep and double through the fair. We were then to enter one of the large dancing booths, and clear it of its occupants, and finally \"pitch into\" any persons who opposed us. Under the influence of the excitement and companionship of the senior cadets, I thought the proceeding a brilliant one. The effect of charging through the fair would be grand, something like a real battle, and the people of the fair would see what a fine set of daring fellows the cadets were. With such ideas I approached the Fair-"], [379, "OLD CHARLTON. 679 field, little dreaming that three days would not elapse before I had come to the con clusion that a more foolish, stupid and ridiculous proceeding could not have been proposed or carried out than this one, and that even the most enthusiastic of the party would admit that it was a contemptible and childish display. On nearing the entrance gate we formed closely in fours, and at a double charged down between the booths. Men, women, and children were knocked over right and left, and sent sprawling on the ground, whilst we were saluted with stones, sticks and other weapons seized impromptu by the indignant public. Having made our way down the fair we entered the largest dancing-booth, which was immediately deserted by the occupants. Seizing the chairs, a few of these were smashed, and shots were then taken at the many-coloured oil-lamps, the majority of which were knocked down, but not broken. There was then a shout to extinguish all the lamps in the fair, whilst one or two of the most reckless cadets 'housed, \" Turn out the menagerie ! \" By this time, however, there was an organised resistance to us. The sticks used for knock-'em-downs were seized by a number of men, who commenced using these very freely, and we were soon compelled to retreat, which we did in tolerably good order ; not, however, without those in rear receiving some very heavy blows. At the Academy matters had not been idle. The cadets having left the Academy, there was a silence that, to the experienced ears of the officer on duty, at once indi cated that something was up. Coming out of his quarters, he found the divisions deserted, and, on entering the library, found the corporal on duty, who informed him the cadets had left the enclosure. The assembly was immediately sounded, and was obeyed only by the corporals on duty and two cadets who were ill, having just left hospital. Taking with him the corporals on duty the officer at once started for the fair, giving orders that each cadet seen was at once to be placed in arrest. Now, as a cadet wras bound in honour to obey an arrest, this plan would have been effective for sending home the company. When, however, the officer was within a hundred yards of the Fair-field he met the cadets returning, and at once ordered the whole of them in arrest to their rooms. For many hundred yards from the fair we were followed by a rabble, who de lighted in pelting us with various missiles and .abusing us, as they now could do with impunity. On reaching the enclosure we all went to our rooms, relating our individual experiences, escapes and performances. One cadet had exchanged blows with a supposed prize-fighter, and had held his own ; another had knocked down a burly rough who was just going to smash the head of a cadet with a life-preserver. This cadet had tripped up a peeler who was trying to collar a cadet ; that cadet had rescued a snooker* who was actually in the grasp of two roughs. The feats performed were reall)' marvellous \u2014 at least in their accounts \u2014 and for that night we were well pleased with ourselves. Forester listened to Fenton's account of the affair, put a few questions, and then pronounced his verdict, that we had all made a set of fools of ourselves, and that probably the company would be decimated, every tenth cadet being discharged. During the next two or three days there were endless speculations as to what would be the punishment given us for our conduct, and as the excitement of the affair wore off the corporals and seniors began to get anxious for their prospects, for it was feared a severe example would be made of at least the corporals and under officers who had gone to the fair. The whole company was confined to barracks, and could not therefore go beyond the \" ha-ha,\" so that groups of twenty or thirty cadets used to assemble every day and walk about arm-in-arm discussing the proceedings at the fair, and the probable results. * A snooker is a first-term cadet."], [380, "680 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. About ten days after the breaking out the whole company was assembled on parade, and the \"decision of the Master-General made known. It was to the effect that every under-officer and corporal present at the fair was to be reduced to the rank of a cadet, all leave stopped till the end ofthe half, and the question left open whether or not the commission of these should be delayed six months. By many this punishment was considered slight, for they had expected to be rusticated, and to lose, consequently, a term ; so that, as soon as the order had been read out, there was a subdued murmur of satisfaction among those who had been the ringleaders of the affair, and whose position as the seniors rendered them responsible. The End. \u2014 Until 18-5.5, or thereabout, it was usual for decent people to visit the Fair-field with their children during the afternoon, but even then the nights were nights of licensed iniquity, in which hosts of people, clad in various disguises, gathered from the towns of Woolwich and Greenwich, and, after hours of excesses in the drinking booths, carried their revelries homeward, to the scandal and annoyance of the surrounding inhabitants. The evil increased to such an extent that a vigorous effort was roused for its suppression, and, despite the protests of the poor cottagers who paid their year's rent out of their profits from the carnival, it was put an end to by an Order in Council in March, 1872.* Charlton Green. \u2014 The fortunes of the historical fair were so long associated with Charlton Green that it is a pleasure to have rescued from oblivion two views of the old Green, tbe first of which shows it as it appeared about a hundred years ago. Plate LXV. (page 663) is dated 1787, and is copied from a coloured drawing, which may, without much doubt, be ascribed to Paul Sandby. Judged hj this evidence the space was not extensive, and we have seen that tbe fair overflowed down the village street. Tbe Green, however, spread out then to the very porch of the church, and the front wall of Charlton Houses ran from the guardhouse at the corner of the village in a line with the stone archway which now stands amid the lawn. Tbe road which then proceeded direct to Woolwich Common is seen in this picture. The present road occupies the site of the houses on the left, which have long disappeared. An old inhabitant informs me that they stood there until 1820, and consisted of two tenements, one in the occupation of Mr. Henry Swabey, a proctor in Doctors' Commons, and the other tenanted by bis brother, Major Swabey, of the Royal Artillery. The * Credit is due in this connection to Mr. Charles Curtoys, who voluntarily took a lease of the Fair-field at the fancy rent of \u00a340 a year (that being the sum yielded by the fair) as an inducement to Sir J. M. Wilson to put a stop to the nuisance without loss. The lease will shortly expire, and the Fair-field, which might well be preserved as an open space in lieu of the Village Green, is threatened by the builders. t The whole of the park was walled round prior to 1776, as shown by Seymour's \" Survey of Kent \" of that year, which says \" Charlton Park joins Woolwich Common and is walled round.\" Seymour adds \u2014 \" On the outside of the wall is a long row of the oldest cypress trees in England.\""], [381, "681 OLD CHARLTON. two houses are supposed to have been at one time tbe rectory and at another a school, perhaps the establishment which was the forerunner of tbe Military Academy at Woolwich. Another Witness. \u2014 Plate LXV. is agreeably confirmed by Miss Eliza Lowther Crofton, who sends me tbe following letter and a pencil sketch from which this pleasant picture of the Green is taken : \u2014 \" 25, AVood Street, Woolwich, \" September 28th, 1888. \"Sir, \" I enclose a little pencil sketch of Old Charlton as it was about 60 years ago, thinking you might perhaps find it useful for your very interesting work. In the background is St. Luke's Parish Church ; in the foreground the old Village Green before it was enclosed in the grounds of Charlton House ; to the right is the square brick orangery (still standing just within the railings of Charlton House), and to the left are two or three houses which formerly stood facing the Green (in the hollow opposite Charlton House). One of them was occupied by a French gentleman, a Monsieur Degville. These houses were pulled down about 60 years ago. There are still two or three lilac trees growing in the hollow which mark the site of the old gardens. \" I am, Sir, yours faithfully, \" Eliza Lowther Crofton.\" Charlton Green about 1828.

The Fate of Charlton Green. \u2014 The confiscation of Charlton Green was not accomplished all at once, but it was carried out with"], [382, "682 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. great determination ; and the Charlton people have always been thorough. Take the case of old Dobeson : \u2014 In 1660 King Charles II. received a memorial on behalf of Mr. Dobeson, \" a loyal sufferer for the late king \" (Charles I.). To show his joy for the restoration Mr. Dobeson \" would needs burn down his windmill at Charlton to make a bonfire ! \" The First Slice off the Green. \u2014 Charlton, however, showed some deliberation in the sacrifice of its small Green, and for once did a thing by halves. A good slice of the ground quietly disappeared between 1819 and 1824, when the main enclosure took place. In the re-issue of Hasted's \"Kent\" by the Rev. T. Streatfeild, the Rev. L. B. Larking and Dr. Drake, it is stated that until 1824 \u2014 The Green had the church at one end, and a house, which was turned into a rectory, at the other, and was bounded on the east side by Charlton House grounds, which then were confined within a boundary line drawn from the guardhouse opposite the church, along the front of Inigo Jones's gateway, and continuing flush with the western face of the pile of outhouses or stables to a road leading to the bull pit, and thence over to the main road to Woolwich Common. The bull-pit, where bulls were once baited, is said to have been surrounded by a fence composed of the jaw-bones of whales, some of which still remain in place. The Green, the road, the Rectory with its gardens, and the bull-pit, were laid into the grounds in 1824. The Last Morsel. \u2014 That did not absorb the whole of the Green, but such innovations, though silently acquiesced in by the inhabitants, rankled in the minds of some of them, and, when attempts were after wards made to enclose the remainder of the Green, there was a vigorous though futile opposition. A newspaper of 11th September, 1840, says : \u2014 Mr. Turtle, a tradesman of Charlton, was summoned for removing notices. It having been found necessary to enlarge the parish churchyard and to turn the public road for the purpose, notices were issued by the magistrates, and one of these was stated to have been torn down by defendant's son, aged 11 years. This was not proved and the case was dismissed. The inhabitants generally, however, were quite supine about the matter, and on the 3rd of April, 1841, we find this item of news : \u2014 The present burial-ground of Charlton having become quite full of inmates, the parishioners last summer applied to Sir Thomas Wilson for permission to enclose a portion of the Green on the south side of the present ground. Sir Thomas gave permission, but wished at the same time to have a certain portion of a contiguous highway stopped up. To this the parishioners had no objection, and the usual steps were taken to carry the plan into effect. The alterations were begun, when Mr. Roupell, a lawyer in London, proprietor of an adjoining estate, declared the stopping up of the highway illegal, and the vestry, intimidated by his threats, stopped the works for some months. However, two or three weeks ago, the falling in of some graves gave such dangerous proof of the state of the ground that another vestry was called, and it was determined that the enclosing of the ground should go on at all risks. Accordingly the workmen recommenced on"], [383, "683 OLD CHARLTON. Monday last, but on Wednesday night Mr. Roupell sent some men to knock down a portion of the new-made wall.* After this matters appear to have taken their course unobstructed. On March 10th, 1843, we are told\u2014 The consecration of additional ground for interment attached to the old church at Charlton took place by the Bishop of Rochester. The ground formed part of the waste of the manor of Charlton and had been granted for this purpose. A curious testimony must be fitted in with the foregoing record. It is the accompanying sketch which I have borrowed from the Illustrated London News of February 4th, 1843, where it appears as a representa tion of Charlton Church on the occasion of Mr. Drummond's funeral. It seems to have been taken from the Green on the south of the church, for there is something like the glimpse of the river in the distance, but, if that be the aspect, the drawing has been re versed by the engraver, a not uncommon acci dent in the early ex perience of woodcuts. The view will not suit the northern side ofthe church, and I give it as evidence, such as it is, of the existence of the Green in February, 1843. Only a month later, as we have just Charlton Church, as represented in \"Illustrated London News,\" on occasion of Mr. Drummond' 's funeral, 1843. seen, the churchyard extension was consecrated, and at this time the enclosure must have been in progress. In the Ecclesiastical Records, the final spoliation is thus described under date of 1842 : \u2014 1842. In this year the parishioners purchased a piece of the Manor Wastrel from Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, Bart., to enlarge the churchyard. * Mr. Stuart Roupell writes : \u2014 \" Horn Fair no doubt would have been a great nuisance to Sir Thomas Wilson and his family. He, therefore, claiming it as Lord of the Manor, proceeded to enclose it as part of the waste of the manor. It was opposed by my father on behalf of the parish and the public\u2014 and I believe carried into court \u2014 the result bein\", I presume, in favour of the lord, since he at once enclosed it and so it has remained ever since. That part by the church at the top of Church Lane where the old tree stands was enclosed about the same time.\"\u2014 (Letter written in 1888.) The enclosures actually covered a period of more than twenty years."], [384, "684 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. This extension cost \u00a3100, of which \u00a313 went as \"compensation\" to the Lord of the Manor, and the remainder in fencing and expenses. The amount was defrayed out of the rates. In earlier times such bargains were not so difficult, and the contrary operation of deducting from the churchyard appears to have been accomplished by the admirable Sir Adam Newton in the time of King James I. The following is tbe official declaration : \u2014 lst August, 1609. The parson, churchwardens, sidesmen and parishioners of Charlton, certified to the Diocesan their consent that Adam Newton, Esq., Lord of the Manor and patron of the living, should enclose, for bis private use, ten perches in length and two perches in breadth of the churchyard ground. Cage and Stocks. \u2014 When the churchyard was extended and the road diverted, the Cage and Stocks, which stood in the corner, were abolished, and the tree which bad occupied the middle of the Green found itself enclosed within a fence on the western side, where we now see it. The records of the Cage and Stocks, containing the names and offences of the prisoners from an early date, were sent to Charlton House when the buildings were removed, and were afterwards destroyed. The First and Second Rectories. \u2014 We have Part of Charlton Green, showing the Cage and Stocks, 1840. distinct records of three successive rectory -houses at Charlton. Of the first of these, which stood in the north-west angle of the Fair-field Road, I shall have more to say presently. It is sufficient to notice here that in 1713 Robert Warren, Rector, exchanged this place (at that time let to James Craggs at \u00a320 a year) for the second Rectory, which was tbe property of Sir AVilliam Langhorne, patron of the church, and valued at \u00a32-5 a year. The second Rectory appears on a map drawn in 1822, to explain tbe then proposed changes in the roads. It stood west of the stables of Charlton House, on the opposite side of the old road which, skirting the Green, passed between, touching the south-west corner of the stables on its way by the bull-pit to enter the road to Woolwich Common. The house may be seen in the plan of 1748 at page 33 of this book."], [385, "685 OLD CHARLTON. But, though the Rectory is demolished, and its garden and site laid into the grounds of Charlton House, it has left a pleasant monument. In passing through Marlborough Lane we see, within tbe park fence, a splendid avenue of trees which seem to have no motive for existence. This was the approach to the old Rectory house. The Third Rectory. \u2014 For the last fifty years the Rectory of St. Luke's has been in its present position on the Blackheath Road. Cherry Orchard. \u2014 The \" Cherry Orchard \" stood and still stands in Marlborough Lane, a little removed from Charlton Park. It com prises a comfortable house already surmised to have been built for his own residence by Inigo Jones. Royalty at Charlton. \u2014 The house described as the first Rectory, which stood in the angle of tbe Fair-field, and has vanished within the last twenty years, had a remark able history. While the property of Mr. Craggs, it was for some time occupied by Mr. James Moffat, the promoter of aeronau tics, and it was also for several years the country retreat of the fascinating Mrs. Fitzherbert, which circumstance frequently brought George IV., when Prince of Wales, to Charlton. Its next occupant was George's unhappy wife, the Princess of Wales, who resided bere for some years. The Prince's visits, however, ceased on its vacation by Mrs. Fitzherbert. More of this later. Tbe same house has subsequently been tenanted by Alderman Atkins, and by General Sir Thomas Hislop, Bart., G.C.B. George IV., when Prince of Wales. Sir Thomas Hislop died in 1843, and was laid in tbe first vault built in the new ground of the churchyard, just then extended. He was the last tenant of the great house, which gradually fell into ruin, until it was pulled down by the lessor, Mr. Curtoys, in 1872. Tbe parish of St. Paul had then been formed, and arrangements were made by which the site was conveyed as a free gift to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the parsonage. x x"], [386, "CHAPTER LIII. CHARLTON, OLD AND NEWr. H.R.H. Princess Louise at Charlton. \u2014 Princess Louise, accom panied by her husband, the Marquis of Lome, paid a visit to Charlton on July 11th, 1887, to inaugurate a bazaar which was organized in aid of one of Her Royal Highness's charitable institutions. The stalls were ranged in a noble avenue within tbe park, and were presided over by graceful and aristocratic dames. The great house and the village hall were the scenes of entertainments, and Shakespeare's comedy of \"As You like It\" was played au nature! in the shrubbery by the lawn. Far happier and brighter this brief royal record than that of another connected with Charlton nearly ninety years before. The Story of Queen Caroline. \u2014 The story of Queen Caroline, briefly referred to in the previous chapter, was a leading feature in the eventful times of our grandfathers, and the old Charlton folk in our youthful days cherished fond memories of that unhappy lady, who for several years at the beginning of the century resided in the old house at Charlton Lane.* It is probable that she took up ber abode bere about 1800, t and we read in The Ambulator of 1807 that she \"makes Charlton her constant country residence, and is much respected and beloved by the neighbourhood.\" At this time she was Princess of Wales; her husband, afterwards George IV., being made Prince Regent in 1811, and crowned on the death of bis father in 1820. He was not popular either as prince or king, and his harsh treatment of his wife helped her in the favour of the people, while it also embittered the greater part of his own life. Marrying her with reluctance, the princess soon became tbe object of his undisguised aversion. Her appearance was repugnant to him, especially as he knew that the marriage had been forced upon him in order to pay bis debts, and, although she gave him a daughter, the ill-matched pair separated soon after they were wedded. * George III. made her Ranger of Greenwich Park in 1800, but the Duchess of Brunswick occupied the Ranger's Lodge. t The grounds extended to a considerable distance in rear, including the site of Lansdowne Road (which was formed in 1842) and the pond behind it. Cold Bath Cottage, which stood near the pond just mentioned, was the residence of Mr. Carver, who died in 1841. He was the predecessor of Mr. E. L. Burnett in the office of vestry clerk."], [387, "PLATE LXVII. East Combe, Charlton, 1777. Woodland House, West Combe, 1795.

Various charges of a highly scandalous description were preferred against her and she came home to meet them. She was accused before tbe House of Lords, and some startling evidence was given, but tbe witnesses were themselves of bad repute, and tbe general feeling of the country was on tbe side of the queen. The case against her broke down and there was a great national rejoicing, in which old inhabitants testify that Charlton took part by a general illumination of tallow candles in all tbe windows. Parliament voted Queen Caroline an annuity of \u00a350,000. She demanded to be crowned with the king at his coronation in 1821, but this was refused, and she was even forbidden to be present as a spectator. She died the same year, August 7th, at the age of fifty-two, and, her death being everywhere ascribed to her persecution, there were some serious riots at her funeral, the mob compelling the procession to pass through the City of London. George IV. died June 26th, 1830. The Roupell Estate. \u2014 In rear of the church (where the Dutch Almshouses now stand) was a mansion built about 1700 by Sir Richard Raynes, who had a considerable estate in this parish. Dr. Raynes, son of Sir Richard, bequeathed this house and estate to his wife's brother, Joseph Kirke, Esq., who devised it to the Rev. Mr. Harris, of Chevely, Cambridgeshire, with remainder to Mr. Brown, and after him to three nephews (sons of three sisters). This is now the Roupell Estate. Lord Cholmondeley took a lease of the grounds, and built another house near the chalk pits,t having pulled down the old mansion in 1793 or 1794 ; the new residence was known as Grove House, and immediately adjoining were tbe grounds belonging to the house occupied by the Princess of AVales. It was Lord Cholmondeley, Controller to the House hold of the Prince of Wales, who obtained this mansion as a residence in the first place for Mrs. Fitzherbert, but she lived there only a few months. The Princess of Wales was unaware that her rival had dwelt there until she had herself been some years in occupation, and as soon as she made the discovery she removed to Montague House, Blackheath. There was a brook which divided the grounds of Grove House from the grounds belonging to the house in which the Princesses resided, * There is reason to believe that this property and Shrewsbury House, where the young princess resided for her education, both passed through the hands of the Prince Regent by the turn of the tables at high play (page 637). t Ninety years' digging of chalk and sand has now eaten into the heart of this hill, and much of the old estate is in the ballast pit. xx 2"], [390, "688 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. (the brook disappeared when tbe sewers were made a few years since), and Lord Cholmondeley had a rustic bridge erected so as to enable tbe Princesses to pass from their own grounds to those of Grove House. Fifty years back the remains of this bridge, being in a decayed state, were removed. It was known as the \" Queen's Bridge.\" In 1802 Lord Cholmondeley sold the lease of his house to Mr. Balfour, who lived there until 1840. The grounds were very romantic and ver}' extensive, reaching from the church to below Cedar Lodge,* which was built by Mr. Balfour for his nephew, Lieutenant Balfour, who died there, after a residence of a few years. After Mr. Balfour's death Sir William Gossett, Sergeant-at-Arms, took the house, in which he also died. He and Lady Gossett lie in a vault in rear of the church. Charlton Chalkpits, 1800. The Great Chalkpits.\u2014 A volume of poems published by T. Noble in 1804, entitled \" Blackheath,\" is dedicated to Princes Char lotte, who we may assume to have been at that time a resident of Charlton. The view here presented is from a sketch made by Mr. Noble, and represents Charlton Church from the chalkpits on the west. These pits are quite distinct and divided by the road from those just mentioned. An immense hollow, which lies between Church Lane and Victoria Road, now marks the spot. It has been for some years a * Near the railway."], [391, "689 CHARLTON. cricket field, but was formed entirely by the removal of the chalk, either for lime and ballast,* or for conveyance across the river by thousands of tons, to fructify the marshy flats of Essex. Tbe following lines by Mr. Noble refer to tbe subject : \u2014 Or would'st thou wander where the turrets rise Of Charlton's fane, where deeper foliage spreads, And cultivation, with luxuriant vest, Robes the rich heights ! There oft within some cavity obscure, Where the chalk crumbles and the sallow smoke Rolls heavy from the calcined lime below, The wizard gipsies and their bantling crew Huddle together through the stormy night. This chalk quarry was worked and had its limekilns in operation some way into this century, and tbe hollow was deeper even than we find it now until the road in Church Lane was lowered. \" Hone's Year Book,\" of 1838 describes a walk through Charlton, and gives an illustration of the church, which shows the lane to be on a level with the churchyard. It was reduced to make an easier gradient about 1842, when the church yard was extended. Charlton Old Church. \u2014 Of the original parish church of St. Luke, Charlton, we have no distinct record, but it was probably a very ancient building. It may, however, be inferred to have been erected of chalk and flints (of which materials there are an abundance close at hand), for while tbe church was under repair a few years .since, a portion of the old foundation walls was laid bare, and was found to consist of chalk and flints entirely. The earlier church appears to have been encased with brickwork when rebuilt by Sir Adam Newton in 1629. The revenues belonged from time immemorial to tbe priors of St. Saviour's, Bermondsey, but were surrendered, with other possessions, at tbe dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII. in 1-537. t The church patronage lay vested in the Crown until James I. bestowed it upon Sir Adam Newton, and thus it descended through the hands of the manorial lord until 1714, when Sir William Langhorne, of pious memory, gave it to the famous rector, Robert Warren, from whom by various stages it again reached the holders of tbe Charlton estates at the beginning of the present century. J The living is consequently at the present time in the gift of Sir Spencer Maryon Wilson, Bart. * Most of the lime used in the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of 1666 came from this spot. This brought some welcome labour, for in the Plague of the previous year Charlton suffered very severely. t The King's Inventory, taken for Imperial purposes in 1552, states that there were three metal bells and a saint's bell hanging in the \" steeple.\" t In the supplement to Lysons' \" Environs,\" published in 1811, we read that \" The advowson has lately been purchased by Lady Wilson.\""], [392, "690 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

The foregoing list shows two between Charities. \u2014 The parochial charities consist of the following gifts and bequests. The almshouses beside the Fair-field were founded by someone unknown. They were rebuilt by Sir Richard Raynes,* four tenements of one room each. The alms people are selected by the rector and churchwardens, and each of them receives 2s. 6d. a week.

In 1654 Thomas Russell, of Charlton, devised his lands, worth \u00a33 a year, to the poor of the parish, but in 1688 some tenant of the property repudiated the obligation and the charity was extinguished. The Old Vestry and Parish School. \u2014 The new edition of Hasted's \" Kent \" says that the chancel was extended in 1840 over the site of the vestry room and charity school, erected, as just stated, by Sir William Langhorne, Bart, (the patron), in 1713. The church was repaired, re-arranged, enlarged, and a new vestry built by voluntary contributions in 1873-4, when the north-west aisle was repaired by Sir John Maryon Wilson, Bart., patron, and lord of the manor. The chancel and north aisle apjpertain to the mansion. The present vestry room was built in 1873. + The communion plate was given partly by Sir Richard Raynes, Kt., in the reign of Anne (1710), and partly by Mrs. Elizabeth Craggs in 1711.

Charlton, from Blackheath Road. From a Drawing by Sandby, 1787. The Charlton Guard. \u2014 Charlton organised its own police force 19th Jan., 1812. Resolved that a watch or guard is necessary for the preserva tion of our lives and properties. That all parishioners whose annual rent is \u00a310 be requested to subscribe or give their personal assistance instead. That keeping watch one night in twelve shall be a fair equivalent to a money subscription. That two men shall keep watch each night from 8 till 5, and that the watchmen be provided with a dark lantern, a rattle, and firearms. That each watchman shall be paid not exceeding 4s. per night. The Charlton Guard did not long endure."], [398, "696 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Jan. 21st, 1S27. (Sunday*) a meeting of parishioners was held ; present, Sir T. M. Wilson, Captain Lindsay, Messrs. Floyd, Tavernson, Noble, and Dobbs. It was resolved that in consequence of the depredations in the parish a watch should be estab lished, and that the watchmen should be paid 2s. 6d. a night when on duty, \" and be under the direction of such parishioners as volunteer their services for that night.'*t A Poorhouse Wanted. \u2014 There is nothing except the entry in the minute book of 1721 to show that Charlton has ever had its own work house, but, at a later period, it has bad thoughts about it : \u2014 29th June, 1820. This vestry having heard that there formerly existed a poor house in this parish, which has been demolished by a gentleman named Jones, Lord of the Manor at that time, and in consideration that Sir T. Wilson, Bart., is now his representative, it is resolved that application be made to Sir T. Wilson for a piece of ground to erect a poorhouse. Mr. Jones, who married into the Manor in 1761, was sfry-great-grand father of Sir Thomas, but the baronet could not admit the inherited liability, and there was no \"house\" for the Charlton poor until the parish joined the Lewisham Union in 1836. We see by tbe following entry the valuation of the Government property : \u2014 1S2(). The Board of Ordnance is rated for 102 acres of common in Charlton at \u00a31 per acre, and for the soldiers' hutsj \u00a3100 for the whole. \u00a7 Hanging Wood Robbers. \u2014 Highway robbery is the theme of many paragraphs relating to Charlton in the old newspapers, and Hanging WoodJI through which travellers on foot were wont to pass, was the scene of numerous adventures. We read \u2014 Aug. Wth, 1732. On Sunday morning the Rev. Mr. Richardson, who keeps a school at Lewisham, going to preach at Woolwich, was attacked by a footpad in Hanging Wood, who robbed him of a guinea (leaving him but twopence) and then made off. * It was usual to hold these business meetings at the church on Sundays after morning service. t The \"guard-house \" at the north-west front of Charlton House probably derived its name from its employment in this service. X The Duke of York's Cottages, built in replacement of mud hovels for soldiers who preferred to live out of barracks, were always known as \" the huts.\" See page 397. \u00a7 In 1803 the vestry appointed commissioners to value the rights of the parishioners in Charlton Common, which was found to contain 102 acres and 6 poles. The herbage was valued at 10s. 3d. per acre, worth \u00a352 a year, \u00a31530 ; gravel for roads, worth \u00a312 a year, \u00a3360, each at thirtv years' purchase. The Crown rejected the claim for herbage, but paid \u00a3360 for the gravel rights. || There is an early reference to \" the wood of Woolwych \" in the Assize Rolls of the 39th year of Henry III. (a.d. 1255), and there is reasonable presumption that Hanging Wood is meant. It says : \u2014 \"John, son of Henry Juventus, was found dead without any mark upon him in the wood of Woolwych. The first finder and the dead man's four next neighbours were attached and not suspected. Verdict, mischance. Vill of Woolwich was amerced (fined) for not holding an inquest.\""], [399, "697 CHARLTON. June 2nd, 1762. Several people have been robbed this week in Hanging Wood, near Woolwich. One gentleman, belonging to the Warren, was robbed of three guineas and a half, and a medal. 1782. Three men robbed a boatswain of a man-of-war, near Hanging Wood, of his watch and ten guineas, but some gentlemen coming up, they took to the wood. Sept. 20th, 1783. On Saturday last as Mr. Young, surgeon, was riding towards Woolwich he was accosted by a genteel-looking young man, who entered into further conversation, and it was agreed to eat a chop together at Woolwich. Having passed a social hour or two, on their return the young man produced a pistol and demanded Mr. Young's money, with threatened destruction in case of delay. Mr. Young, having no arms, was obliged to give up near twenty pounds. 1812. On Tuesday last a poor boy was murdered in a wood near Woolwich by a ruffian who, having robbed his master and being pursued, fled for refuge to the wood, where being seen by the boy, the latter screamed with terror of him, on which the villain seized and strangled him. Fossil Beds. \u2014 Altogether Hanging Wood bad an evil reputation, but it was always a lovely spot. Geologists have derived much know ledge from its borders, for the cliff which runs from the top of Upper Woodland Terrace in a north-west direction is very full of fossils. Tbe deposit overlies the sand bed. Examples of the shells, &c, found here and in the neighbourhood, including those of the chalk, may be seen at tbe Geological Museum in Jermyn Street, or in tbe Museum of the Royal Artillery Institution. Much valuable information on the subject is contained in the fourth volume ofthe \" Transactions of tbe Geological Society,\" by Dr. Buckland and others. Woodward's work on fossils says \u2014 - In this pit the first stratum is gravel, from 5 to 15 feet deep ; beneath are various strata of gravel, loam, and marl ; running parallel, and in the stratum of marl, are found a prodigious quantity of extraneous fossils. The vein is 6 or 8 feet thick, and the shells in it are so numerous that the mass seems almost wholly composed of them. Ancient Camp. \u2014 The vestiges of ancient earthworks which occupy the summit of the high land, near the same spot, are referred to at page 10. Hanging Wood Lane. \u2014 The lane through the wood, although curtailed, has lost little of its original beauty since Lysons in his \" Environs of London,\" 1796, wrote \u2014 There are in Charlton about ninety acres of woodland called Hanging Wood, belonging to the Lord of the Manor, through which there is a very pleasant walk to Woolwich. The wood, the variety of uneven ground, and the occasional views of the river, contribute to make the neighbourhood remarkably picturesque. In 1761 someone thought it was worth while to say in a newspaper that \u2014 The right kind of hypericuni for the cure of worms Wood, near Woolwich. grows wild in Charlton"], [400, "698 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. East Combe. \u2014 On the north of the Blackheath Road, half a mile east of Charlton Church, is East Combe, which became in 1819 the seat of the Dowager Countess of Buckinghamshire, who died in 1851. A few years later, when in the occupation of Mr. Mott, it was burnt down, but was at once rebuilt. The estate was formerly called Nether combe, and, with the manor of Lewisham, belonged to St. Peter's Abbey at Ghent. On tbe suppression of the alien priories Henry V. trans ferred it to his new priory at Sheen, whose property it remained until the twenty-third year of Henry VIII., when it reverted to the Crown, and was disposed of. Some years afterwards it became the property of tbe Sandersons. Sir William Sanderson, created baronet in 1720, lived here, and Lady Sanderson, who survived her husband, died possessed of the property in 1780, when it came to the Right Hon. Frederick Montague, heir at law. The mansion, which is on the summit of the \"combe,\" overlooks the Thames and commands a picturesque view. The Duchess of Athol resided here in 1777. (See page 686). Sir W. Congreve. \u2014 The house adjacent on the east, and now the residence of the Dowager Lady I. M. Wilson, was formerly occupied by Major Congreve, the inventor of the rocket which bears his name. He was then Superintendent of the Laboratory at Woolwich Arsenal. On one occasion the Prince Regent came down with others to witness the practice of the Congreve rocket, and on his return to London he called by arrangement to lunch at the house of the Major, who was at the time unfortunately laid up with the gout and could not join his guests. After partaking of his hospitality, and washing it down with an ample quantity of good wine, the Prince and party left for London, commis sioning Mr. Dobbs, who was in attendance, to inform tbe Major that the Prince Regent had knighted him. On Mr. Dobbs going to so inform him, the Major said, \" But is he not coming up to see me ? \" On being told be had left for London, the Major exclaimed, \"Well, well, who would have thought the first gentleman in Europe would have acted so ! \" Sir William soon after left this house and went to live in the .south of France, where he died. Westcombe Park. \u2014 Woodlands lies to the west of East Combe, and is now embraced in the growing suburb known as Westcombe Park. The mansion was built by John Julius Angerstein, an opulent Russian merchant and underwriter, who collected many valuable pic tures, which he sold to the Government, and they formed the nucleus of the collection now in the National Gallery. About 1815, when advanced in years, Mr. Angerstein had an apartment fitted with hot-air flues to preserve for himself an even temperature of 65\u00b0, and he invited King George III. to inspect it. The King accordingly paid a visit to Woodlands, and wished Mr. Angerstein many years' enjoyment of his"], [401, "699 CHARLTON. invention, but added, \" For my part I prefer a good old English fire place and Wallsend coals.\" Mr. Angerstein lived into his ninety seventh year and died in 1823. His son William, who succeeded him, removed to Norfolk about 1875, and the estate was laid out for building. Charlton in 1748. \u2014 -We may learn a good deal about the old highways and byways of Charlton from the plan of Woolwich and Charlton Commons which was drawn in 1748, and is copied at page 33, from the original in the Royal Artillery Institution. We see that the direct road from Charlton village to Woolwich by way of Little Heath was not then formed. It was not formed in fact until 1806, but existed in embryo long before in the shape of a footpath across fields from Love Lane (see plan, page 385). Little Heath. \u2014 Little Heath was a small clearing on the edjje of the wood from very early times. It is described as \" Little Heath Common\" in 1803, when it was claimed by Lady Wilson as her free hold of the manor, under a consent given by twenty landowners in 1763. The carriage-way from Charlton to Woolwich was round Charlton Park, and the drivers had a choice of routes on either side, but they could not cross Little Heath until 1806. The Soldiers' Mile.- \u2014 A simple understanding of the thoroughfare past Charlton House was afforded me by the late Mr. E. J. Saunders,* who resided at the Bugle Horn for a good many years prior to 1835. He stated that before the road past Charlton House was diverted it marked almost exactly a mile radius from Woolwich Garrison, and that the soldiers, being at that time allowed to wander no farther than a mile from barracks, made tbis their favourite walk, passing through Old Charlton and round the upper part of the Common, every point being within the stipulated distance. But the stoppage of the thoroughfare past Charlton House diverted the traffic to Marlborough Lane, and the increased radius not only spoilt the perambulations of Tommy Atkins and his Mary Ann, but also had a material effect upon tbe weekly profits of the Bugle Horn. The road is shown in a parish plan of 1821, running north and south, and the plan of 1748 (page 33) indicates it very clearly. A Road through the Park. \u2014 Our plan does not reveal so \u2022distinctly the road which at one time bisected the park from east to west, crossing from the point marked by tbe gates in Park Lane to the gates in Marlborough Lane, whence it doubtless proceeded * Better known as \"King Saunders,\" from his predominance in his youth at athletic games."], [402, "700 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. in a direct line to the Dover Road and to Blackheath. A row of worn-out trees still stands in the park, showing the course of this extinct highway ; and the reader in passing along Park Lane may, at the spot where the sudden end of the wall marks the commencement of the newer enclosure, make out at a glance the lines of both the abolished roads. Bull Pit. \u2014 Just inside the Park Lane gate is the deep hollow known as the \" Bull Pit.\" Tbis was at one time outside the park and on the verge of \" Charlton Common.\" It has the appearance of having been excavated for gravel, and, although it has been occasionally resorted to for materials until our own time, the apparent age of the trees which grow abundantly within it seems to show that it ceased to serve its original purpose quite a hundred years ago. In its present shape, its great depth and perpendicularity appear to render it unsuitable even for the torture of bulls and bulldogs. It has been said that when the pit was enclosed (or its use forbidden) the \" sport \" of bull-baiting was transferred to the hollow ground at the corner of Kidbrook Common in Shooters' Hill Road. Bull-baiting remained the fashion until the end of the last century, and was at that time prevalent throughout England in more or less degenerate form. Struts, in his \" Book of Sports,\" published in 1801, says: \u2014 Bull- and bear-baiting is not encouraged by persons of rank and opulence in the present day ; and when practised, as rarely happens, it is attended only by the lowest and most despicable part of the people ; which plainly indicates a general refinement of manners and prevalency of humanity among the moderns. On the contrary, this barbarous pastime was highly relished by the nobility in former ages, and countenanced by persons of the most exalted rank, without exception even of the fair sex. When Queen Mary visited her sister, the Princess Elizabeth, during her confinement at Hatfield House, the next morning, after mass, a grand exhibition of bear-baiting was made for their amusement, with which, it is said, \" their highnesses were right well content.\" The same princess, soon after her accession to the throne, gave a splendid dinner to the French ambassadors, and baiting of bulls and of bears. And again, twenty-seven years posterior, Queen Elizabeth received the Danish ambas sador at Greenwich, who was treated with the sight of a bear- and bull-baiting, \" tempered,\" says Holinshed, \" with other merry sports.\" The manner in which these sports were exhibited towards the close of the sixteenth century is thus described by a foreign writer, who was present at one of these performances : \" There is a place built in the form of a theatre, which serves for baiting of bulls and bears. They are fastened behind, and then worried by great English bulldogs, but not without risque to the dogs, from the horns of the one and the teeth of the other ; and it sometimes happens that they are killed on the spot ; fresh ones are immediately supplied in the places of those that are wounded or tired. To this entertainment there often follows that of whipping a blinded bear, which is performed by five or six men standing circularly with whips, which they exercise upon him without any mercy, as he cannot escape because of his chain ; he defends himself with all his force and skill, throwing down all that come within his reach and are not active"], [403, "701 CHARLTON. enough to get out of it, and tearing the whips out of their hands, and breaking them.\" A writer of our own, speaking of a bear-baiting exhibited before Queen Elizabeth, says, \" It was a sport very pleasant to see the bear, with his pink eyes leering after his enemies' approach ; the nimbleness and wait of the dog to take bis advantage, and the force and experience of the bear again to avoid his assaults ; if he were bitten in one place, how he would pinch in another to get free ; that if he were taken once, then by what shift with biting, with clawing, with roaring, with tossing, and tumbling, he would wrek and wind himself from them ; and, when he was loose, to shake his ears twice or thrice, with the blood and the slaver hanging about his physiognomy.\" Horse Infirmary. \u2014 Near the Bull Pit, but on the opposite side of Park Lane, is a blind cartway. This is the remnant of the road which formerly went from Charlton Church across the site of the Horse Infirmary on the Common. (See plan of 1748, page 33.) The Horse Infirmary was built in 1804, and the free communication of the village with the upper Common was thus finally and effectually cut off. Charlton Common. \u2014 Numerous references, some of which we have just seen, appear in the vestry books relating to Charlton Common,* but the most surprising disclosure is found in this plan of 1748, in the appearance of tbe hedgerow down tbe middle of tbe open ground, dividing the Woolwich and Charlton Commons one from the other. This has been referred to in connection with the sister parish (page 389), and we have seen that by the side of the hedge was a road and stream, which was the ancient conduit from the springs of Shooters' Hill to the ponds and rivulets below, now supplanted by invisible drains and sewers. t Through the Wood. \u2014 The plan does not show distinctly the high way across tbe Common from Nightingale Yale, nor the road, still traceable by its relics, which stretched from Shooters' Hill down tbe Common and through Hanging Wood to the Thames, both of which roads are clearly shown in earlier and later maps. (See page 129, Plate XIX.) Tbe road was not allowed to pass directly through the wood in 1832, but even in that year a right-of-way skirted the eastern side of \" tbe Swamp,\" from the spot where we see the iron cottage at Little Heath Gate to the older cottage at Woodland Terrace, following the course ofthe old road at the north end for 150 yards.+ Pound Park. \u2014 At the same time another thoroughfare extended * See pages 694 and 696. t A large brick sewer now follows almost the same course, and is used to drain the Herbert Hospital and Royal Military Academy. The stream, however, divided, one branch going towards the Commandant's Pond, while the other may still be traced by the willows at the back of the Repository. t I believe that this old road went over the site of Col. W. J. B. Graham's resi dence at Woodland Terrace, and straight through \" the pits \" down to the old ferry. A footpath from Little Heath across two fields to Cemetery Lane survived until 1860. Y Y"], [404, "702 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. along the valley east of Pound Park,* from the spot where the railway crosses Charlton Lane to the dip of Hanging Wood Lane. Graham's Flower Show. \u2014 A bappy remembrance of Hanging Wood is tbe annual flower show and fete, which were given by Mr. George Hall Graham at Little Heath. Mr. Graham combined with a genial philanthropy a passion for floriculture, and it was bis delight in the spring of each year to remove from his conservatories in Brewer Street, Woolwich, to tbe grounds of the outer park t his stock of pelar goniums and other specimens for free exhibition. In great marquees the flowers wer\u00bb displayed, but they were but a small part of the attrac tions, various amusements being provided for jroung and old, culminat ing in a display of fireworks and a monster bonfire on the crest of the slope. Being always the first fete of the year, and invitations being liberally distributed by the generous donor, the populace assembled in great numbers, and the beautiful grounds have been the scene of many such memorable meetings, which ceased only on the death of Mr. Gra ham in 1872. Mr. Graham was agent to tbe Wilson estates, and raised the Charlton Rifle Corps, of which he was many years commanding officer. Charlton Village in 1800. \u2014 Two interesting sketches of the village as it appeared in tbe early days of the present century are here presented. (Plate LXVIII.) Tbe originals were entrusted to me by tbe late Mr. Saunders, before mentioned, who was born in 1800, and who stated that they quite agreed with his earliest recollections. It will be noticed that the cottages and footpath on the north side were at that time below the level of the road. This was consequent on an earlier improvement which had rectified the natural hollow of tbe surface and made the way smooth, but had left the houses at their original depth. These cottages have since been entirely replaced by modern houses and shops in proper trim with the highway, but we may see the former depression of tbe surface by glancing into the back gardens. Mr. Saunders told me that a man standing in the roadway could peep into tbe upper windows of the cottages. In the south view, beyond the Bugle Horn and the two butchers' shops which supported it and are now absorbed into it, we see the Cage, in which Mr. Saunders and other young villagers of sixty years since have often sat all night on the * Known as Pound Field, from the pound in the south-west corner until about 1870, when it was dignified with the more sounding title, to serve as a scene for holi day festivals. t The name of \"the Swamp,\" which was sometimes profanely applied to the whole of the beautiful grounds, was derived from the stream which soddened the lower valley."], [405, "PLATE LXVIII.

The Cage and stocks were, as we have seen, abolished about 1842. Departed Landmarks. \u2014 In the \" Water Companion,\" published in 1802, it is remarked that \u2014 In sailing through the reach called \" Bugsby's Hole\" we see on the left bank of the river at Charlton a whimsical building with three high towers and a rotunda on the top. Mr. Perry's high building for placing and replacing the masts of ships also attracts your notice to admiration. The Gibbets. From Hogarth's \" Idle Apprentice.\" The Gibbets. \u2014 A little higher up the river on the marsh banks were gibbets upon which malefactors convicted of murders on the high seas were hanged. One of these horrible gallows is shown in a per spective view of the river Thames taken from the King's Arms, Black wall, in 1712; and Hogarth's well-known picture of \" The Idle Appren tice \" doubtless has reference to the same spot. Just beyond the Anchor and Hope there was a three-armed gibbet about the year 1835, and upon it were suspended the bodies of several pirates hanging in chains for a very long while.

The old cottages in tbe vignette stood until within the last twenty years, when they made way for the bouse of Mr. Martin. A Native Poet. \u2014 In one of these bouses was born Mr. Charles Jolly7, the author of many poetical effusions, chiefly on local subjects, of which the following, suggested by the yew-tree in Charlton Old Houses next Charlton Church Drawn in 1847. Churchyard, is a good example THE OLD YEW-TREE. A yew tree stood in the hallowed shade Of an old grey church, half overrun With mosses, and ivy interlaid, Like sorrow and hope grown into one ; And its heavy folds drooped softly o'er To the beds of the sleeping things that rest In the long-hushed sleep of the evermore, Like the mother would to the child at her breast, When a fretful moan from its lips would start Into life all the fears of her innermost heart. The gentle winds of the evening came And lifted its heavy tresses, so That through them the yellow-tinted flame Of the western clouds gleamed to and fro ; Or shook out its berries, ruby red, On the turf beneath, till they looked like tears That a mourner's broken heart had shed In the passionate grief of its fullest years. Ay ! tears of blood for the loved one, flown From the life that but lived in its love alone. And the rustling ivy on the wall, That ever creeps on like the sleepless time, Sang softly one night, when it sang at all, And low, as the distant city's chime ; For under that yew-tree's deepest shade, And close to the eastern porch that day The sexton another green heap had made, And the mourners had wept and had gone away. But the yew-tree bent down its passionate head, For it loved so the beautiful life just fled. For oft she would come when a little child As meek as the angels well might be, And the sun on the western turrets smiled, To the slumbrous shade of the old yew-tree. And she read in the marble volumes there Of many a beautiful hope and trust,"], [409, "705 CHARLTON. Till the place to her seemed like a temple where Might dwell all things perfect, and pure, and just. And the yew-tree would whisper, when she was gone, To the ivy about her till early dawn. And when after many years she grew Into her beautiful maidenhood, With deep eyes full of that dreamy blue That you could not help loving so if you would, She would linger awhile in the old loved place, And the yew-tree trembled with joy to see The smile on her innocent angel face That bloomed like a bud on a young rose-tree, But alas ! for the rose's tender glow When the wintry winds begin to blow. So the winds bowed down her gentle head, And piled up the snow on her velvet cheek, Like winter does when the summer's fled And the blasts from the northern seas are bleak. And they laid her down where she loved to rest, In the quiet shade by the eastern door, And the yew-tree drooped upon her breast With a tenderer shadow than ever of yore : And whispers all night to the ivy, \" Love, Our beautiful one is enthroned above ! \" Admirers of \" Our Local Poet \" may also be pleased with the follow ing selection from his works. The poem was due to the circumstance of a poor old dog following him borne one wintry night, and it is called \u2014 THE SUPPLICANT. Poor old dog, you may come, for I know what you mean By the eloquent look of your pitiful eye, For the breath of the winter blows chilly and keen, And the white flaky snow drifts so drearily by. Yes, come, poor old fellow, and lie by my hearth And I think I've a bone I can give thee to gnaw, For the hunger that drives thee, poor dog, in my path Hath never, thank God, yet o'ershadowed my door. Poor old dog, thou art lame, and I see by thy form Nor beauty nor breed hath a claim on thy birth ; Ah, well, there are men, dog, who starve in the storm, And women, and children, faint down to the earth ; Yes, like thee, all lowly, all hungry, and sad ; All timidly asking for shelter and food, The image of God cowers, patient, or mad, 'Neath the scowd of the selfish, the scoff of the rude. Do you know me, old fellow ? You fawn at my knee Like an old friend new found after many long years ; And I feel a sweet sympathy, doggie, for thee, Till there flows to my eyelids the tenderest tears."], [410, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 706 Then lay thee to sleep ; thou art weary and worn And thy eloquent gratitude saddens my heart, For I tell thee thou must with the break of the morn On thy sad weary pilgrimage quickly depart. The Churchyard Closed.\u2014 The church and churchyard were ordered to be closed against burials on January lst, 1854, but the order was extended by several grants until June 29th, 1855, and the nominal date of closing was July 31st in the same year, but, by special licence, some fourteen years subsequently, tbe burial of Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, Bart., who died May 5th, 1869, aged sixty-nine years, was per mitted to take place in the family vault under the church, with the express condition that this should be the last of such interments. The Wilsons have now a vault in the cemetery. Charlton Cemetery. \u2014 The consecration of the cemetery was per formed by the Bishop of London on July 26th, 1855, and the cemetery Charlton Cemetery. From the original design, 1862, was opened on August 1st, 1855. The first interment was that of a lad who was killed by the kick of a horse at Manor Farm, Kidbrook ; and the first burial service was performed by the Rev. Francis Cameron, who was then curate of St. Luke's, and became rector in 1862. Charlton Cemetery, which is unexcelled in beauty by any in the vicinity of London, was one of the earliest established under the Burial Act, and the ground originally taken for it covered rather more than five acres, purchased of Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson at \u00a3500 an acre, but it has recently been enlarged by the addition of a plot of three more acres on the north side, purchased of Sir John Maryon Wilson at \u00a31,000 an acre.

Tasteful planting of trees and shrubs, careful gardening, and constant attention, have preserved and enhanced its superlative cha racter, and a somewhat high scale of fees for non-parishioners has had the effect of attracting the wealthier orders of society. Its monuments are consequently handsome and numerous. Tbe two chapels, Episcopal and Nonconformist, stand on the rising ground and are seen to advan tage from the public road. Both are built of Kentish ragstone with Bath-stone dressings. The contracts for laying out, building chapels, lodge, entrance gates, and front wall amounted to \u00a32,612, but works and additions involved further expenses, and the Burial Board has at present a loan unliquidated of \u00a33,800. Mr. E. L. Burnett was clerk of the Board until August, 1886, when Mr. R. C. Ratcliff succeeded him. St. Paul, Charlton. \u2014 The church of St. Paul, Charlton, was con secrated on March 19th, 1867, the district or parish having been created November 4th, 1862. The Rev. W. H. Pritchett, M.A., was rector until his death in 1885. He was succeeded by the Rev. C. J. Witherby, the present rector. A few years after the church was built the founda tions subsided on the north side, and Mr. Barry, the architect, strengthened tbe structure by a new inner arch over the chancel. A substantial porch was erected in 1885 in memory of \" The Rev.

They have a fair almshouse built by themselves, standing in Moorfields, to contain twenty-six poore, together with a very handsome room for their elders and overseers to meet in to consult together for the good estate and ordering of these poore as occasion may require. The old almshouses were purchased by the London and North- * Immemorial. + See Woolwich, page 171. X In 1881."], [413, "709 CHARLTON.

The demand increasing, and there being some charity money left in Chancery, the Dutch Churchmen came down with liberal subscriptions, and built the new block, which was publicly opened on July 9th, 1886. This building is designed for a convalescent home, more particularly for the children of Church members. The People. \u2014 In population and rateable value Charlton has shown a relative increase corresponding with the latter-day growth of its neighbours. Even in its earlier days it made progress, for the inhabi tants, though sew, were nearly doubled between 1680 and 1780. Of such pre-census times we have only the registers for our guides, but these are fairly reliable, and may be tabulated thus : \u2014 The foregoing estimate is calculated on a death-rate of twenty-four per thousand, a high figure at the present day, but probably not excessive, even for Charlton, in dealing with the last century. It will be remarked however, that in the short interval between 1795, and the first census in 1801 there is wide difference, the population increasing from an esti mated 384 to a positive 747. t But, to test the accuracy of our calcu lation, we take the vestry records of 1805, and find therefrom a corres ponding increase, the baptisms being 29, and the burials 31, indicating a population of 744, and fairly verifying our deduction.^ The census returns for the several decades of the present century are as follow : \u2014 * The foundation-stone ofthe first block was laid on August 18th, 1868. t AVoolwich and Plumstead show a like increase at the same period. X Counting the houses does not help us so well. In 1795 there were 95 houses in the parish. In 1801, according to the returns under the Population Act, there were 117 and in 1811 there were 128, \"exclusively\" (says Lysons) \" ofthe almshouses, and the establishment belonging to a large infirmary for sick and lame horses, erected by the Board of Ordnance on Charlton Common in the year 1804.\" I Baptisms.

Once a Parish.- \u2014 Kidbrook is not a parish, but a liberty or hamlet attached to Charlton, having, however, tbe \" liberty \" of performing parochial functions under its own separate vestry, churchwardens, and overseers. It was probably in the early times a distinct parish, but, its parish church having decayed and clerical government departed, it was driven to take shelter under tbe wing of its neighbour. Constitution. \u2014 Now that it has once more a parish church, and with it a population, Kidbrook might again assert an independent exis tence, but it occupies, nevertheless, a somewhat anomalous position. It was taken from the Lewisham Union and joined to tbe Woolwich Union when formed in 1868, and it has been part of the Plumstead District since the district was created in 1856. To each Board it sent at first but one member ; at tbe Union it now has two Guardians, and it has been recently granted three representatives at the District Board. Growth. \u2014 Tbe houses which make modern Kidbrook are all more or less handsome and valuable, and have all been built within the com pass of tbe living generation. Forty years since Kidbrook contained only the manor farmhouse, and less than a dozen labourers' cottages, and in 1811 there were officially stated to be only six houses within its borders. In 1861 the houses numbered 116 ; in 1871, 208 ; and in 1881, 284. The whole area lies between Blackheath and Shooters' Hill, and covers 756 acres."], [416, "712 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Tbe growth of the population is thus shown in tbe census returns : \u2014 Name. \u2014 The \" liberty \" was formerly described as \" Ketebrook \" and \" Kedbrook,\" and it was also anciently written \" Chitebroc.\" Its name is undoubtedly derived from tbe \"Ket\" brook which, as we have seen (page 659), takes its rise at Shooters' Hill, and broadens into the river Quaggy. There is a very antique record of Kidbrook in a deed in Latin, dated 1203, wherein Ailman de Badefern acknowledges an acre and a half of land in \" Ketebroc \" to be right of Gunilda, wife of Robert Parmenter. But, though we may feel certain that the brook named the place, we cannot so positively trace the origin of the brook's own name. Kette in Anglo-Saxon was to cut (Halliwell's Archaic). Ket in the north is a term for dirt ; thus, a slut or untidy person is called a ket. Kitte in Anglo-Saxon was a tankard, bottle, or water- vessel (hence kit, a milk-pail \u2014 Bosworth's Anglo-Saxon). The Ket-brook has not the appearance of having ever been an unclean stream,:*: and its title is more likely to have been derived from one of the other two sources \u2014 probably meaning the kette or cut-brook. The Ancient Church. \u2014 So long as Kidbrook could boast of a church it could also boast of some records, for, although it seems to have been without endowment, it was not without a patronage. In Dr. Drake's edition of Hasted it is shown that the church had seen its best days as long ago as 1494. In that year on July 3rd, a jury, sitting at Deptford, found \u2014 \u2022 That the Prior and Convent of the convent church of St. Mary Overy, Southwark, held the manor of Kedbroke in the vill of Kedbroke, with its appurtenances, under Shorters' (sic) hill, on condition of finding a fit resident priest to celebrate in the church of St. Blazy \u00a7 there, and to minister when necessary. That in default the church had been allowed to lapse, and the chapel only remained, without any priest. The parishioners worshipped at Charlton, or some other parish church. When in * A number of harvest workers are included in this figure. + In 1815 the assessment of Kidbrook was .\u00a32,028, and in 1881 it was \u00a321,316. X Orders were given in the reign of Edward II. (1307) to attend to \" the brook between Greenwich and Woolwich.\" \u00a7 St. Blaise is the patron saint of wool-combers, because he suffered martyrdom by being torn to pieces with combs.

The church or chapel here mentioned was demolished about 300 years ago. It was situated a little south-east of the present church ; and its remains were incorporated among the outhouses of tbe manor farm. The Church Ruins. \u2014 The remnants of the church walls, which were of great thickness, were demolished a few years since (1882) ; tbe fragments of a holy water stoup in the ruins gave evidence of their ecclesiastic character. History of the Manor, \u2014 The manor of Kidbrook with the ad vowson of the church is stated in the new edition of Hasted to have been \u2014 Given to the Priory of St. Mary Overy, by Cecilia, daughter oi Pain Fitzjohn, and wife of Miles Fitzwalter, Earl of Hereford, and at the dissolution of the monastery (being then on lease to John Rychemonte) it came into the hands of the Crown. Queen Elizabeth granted a lease of the rectory of Kidbrook, anno 1579, to Brian Annesley, Esq. King James, in 1604, granted the manor and rectory, in fee, to John, Earl of Mar. From him they passed to Sir William Garway, who, soon after wards, conveyed them to his son-in-law, Edward Blount, Esq., of Wricklemarsh. Mr. Blount sold the fee-simple to Brian Annesley, Esq., above mentioned. Mr. Annesley left three daughters ; the youngest of whom, Cordelia, brought this estate to her husband, Sir William Hervey, a naval officer, who had distinguished himself in the memorable engagement with the Spanish Armada. He was created by King Charles, in 1628, Baron Hervey of Kidbrook. His only surviving daughter and heir, Eliza beth, married John Hervey, Esq., of Ickworth, who sold this estate to Edward, Lord Montague of Boughton. John, Duke of Montague, his grandson, having procured an Act of Parliament to vest certain of his estates in trustees, in order that they might be sold, this manor (with the rectory) was purchased by James Craggs, Esq., joint Postmaster-General [see his monument at Charlton], whose only son having died before him without male issue, his three daughters, Anne, Elizabeth, and Margaret, became his co-heirs. Anne married lst, John Newsham, Esq. ; 2nd, John Knight, Esq. ; 3rd, Robert Nugent, Esq. (afterwards Earl Nugent). Elizabeth married Edward Eliot, Esq. Margaret married lst, Samuel Trefusis, Esq. ; 2nd, Sir John Hinde Cotton, Bart. Margaret died in 1734, and, having no surviving issue, left her share between her sisters. Anne died in 1756, having vested her moiety in trustees for divers uses, with remainder to her husband in tail. Mrs. Eliot died in 1765, having bequeathed her moiety in like manner, with remainder to her nephew James, (son of her sister Anne by her first husband, John Newsham), who had taken the name of Craggs, with remainder to Edward Eliot, Esq., of Port Eliot, in Cornwall. Mr. Newsham Craggs died in 1769 without issue. This manor then became the property of the Right Hon. Edward Craggs, Lord Eliot.* The manor house is now the farm residence of Mr. George Maxwell.

Sir John Morden, founder of Morden College, purchased the estate in 1669 for \u00a31,950, and resided in the man sion, the site of which was near to the present Blackheath Park Church. He died in 1708, and Sir Gregory Page came into possession, also by purchase, in 1723, and erected a magnificent edifice of stone, which, with the noble park more than a mile long, constituted one of the finest private seats in England. His great-nephew, Sir Gregory Page Turner, succeeded him in 1775, and in 1783 he sold tbe property (which had cost \u00a390,000) by auction for \u00a322,550 to Mr. Cater, of Beckenham. He resold it in lots, and the house, which was dismantled and left to ruin, was pulled down in 1787. The park was laid bare and ploughed up, but a small portion of the building remained at the beginning of tbis century.* Two other still more remarkable buildings are associated with Kid- o brook by attachment, though neither building is strictly within its boundaries. These are Morden College, on the Blackheath border of Charlton, and the ancient manor house of Well Hall, on the Woolwich Boad to Eltham, and just within the last-named parish. Morden College. \u2014 The following description of Morden College is appended to the original design of which the illustration (page 717) is a copy : \u2014 The west prospect of Morden College in the parish of Charleton, in the county oi Kent, now erecting at the sole charge of the Honoured Sir John Morden, of Rickle marsh, in the said parish of Charleton, Bart. ; who hath liberally endowed it for the maintenance of forty decayed merchants, in a more than usual manner, as well as to dyet and apartments to themselves, as to their stipents or salaryes for their support in a gentile livelyhood, this being tbe noblest, greatest, and most charitablest guift of any subject of these Three Kingdoms, especially in the life-tinie of the Donor, to his eternal glory and for the good example of others to follow soe pious a worke. In Hughson's Circuit of London, 1808, it is stated that \u2014 Morden College, on the east side of Blackheath, for the support of decayed merchants, was erected by the before-mentioned Sir John Morden, Bart., a Turkey merchant, previously to his death, which happened in 1708.

There was arable land of four teams, and in demesne two teams, four acres of meadow and wood of fifteen hogs, the whole worth 100 shillings. Eleven villans and two cottars had two teams. It was described as Writelmarsh in 1283, and in 1493 John Fulthorp of \" Wrytelmarsshe \" desired to be buried in Charlton Church before the high altar of the Blessed Mary, and left legacies for that purpose : 6s. 8d. to the church and the image of St. Luke, 10s. to the rector to pray for his soul, and one cow, valued at 8s., which will give a fair index to the value of money. In 1549 the estate was described as Wryklemarsh or Writelmarsh, and in 1594 \" Robert Veere, of Ricklemarsh, in the parryshe of Charlton, Esquier,\" left 20s. to the Charlton poor. (This Robert Veere was third son of John Veer, Earl of Oxford, \" lord of the manor of Wricklesniarsh.\")"], [420, "716 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. is of brick, with two small wings. The entrance is decorated with Doric columns, festoons, and a pediment, over which rises a turret, with a dial : the inner square is surrounded with piazzas. The chapel is neatly wainscotted, and has an altar-piece. This structure Sir John erected at a small distance from his own habitation of Old Court, and endowed it, after his lady's decease, with his whole estate, to the value of about \u00a31,300 per annum, and placed here twelve decayed Turkey merchants during his lifetime. Lady Morden, however, finding that the share allotted her by Sir John's will was insufficient for her support, on account of a diminution in the value of the estate, was obliged to reduce the number of pensioners to four. Upon her death, the whole estate coming to the college, the number was increased ; and the number not being limited, it is to be increased as the estate will afford. The building will conveniently hold forty decayed merchants. The treasurer has .\u00a340 per annum ; the chaplain, who reads prayers twice a day, and preaches twice every Sunday, had at first a salary of \u00a330 per annum, which Lady Morden augmented to \u00a360 at her death. This lady was, in other respects, a benefactress of the college, and the trustees placed a statue of her in a niche adjoining to that of her husband. The pensioners have each an annual stipend of \u00a320. They have a common table in the hall, and each has two convenient rooms with a cellar. The treasurer, chaplain, and pensioners are obliged to reside in the college, and, except in case of sickness, no other persons are to reside or lodge there. No person can be admitted as a pensioner under sixty years of age. Seven trustees of the Corporation of Turkey Merchants have the direction of this hospital and the nomination of pensioners. The Rev. Moses Browne, author of \" Piscatory Eclogues,\" \"All-Bedevilled,\" and other pieces, was a chaplain to this college, and was buried here at the age of eighty two, in September, 1787. Old Court. \u2014 The manor-farm of Old Court, which is supposed to have been the original site of the Manor of Greenwich, was one of tbe estates bequeathed to this foundation by Sir John Morden, who, baving purchased the unexpired term of a lease of it from tbe heirs of Sir William Boreman in 1699, procured in the same year a grant from the Crown of the perpetuity. Romantic Legend. \u2014 According to a tradition current in tbe College, Sir John Morden resided many years at Aleppo, and returned to England to settle. Having shipped the whole of his merchandize on board three of his ships, he sent them on a trading voyage, after which they were to proceed to the port of London. Years passed without tidings of them, till they were given up for lost, and Sir John, being reduced to extreme poverty, was employed by a tradesman to procure orders from customers. While waiting in the hall of a gentleman's house, he overheard him exclaim, \"Here is an astonishin\u00b0 circumstance ! \" and read from a paragraph in a newspaper stating that three ships had just arrived, supposed to be lost, for they bad not been beard of for ten years or more. Sir John rushed into the city and found they were his own long-lost vessels ; and in the joy of tbe moment he vowed to build an asylum for decayed merchants."], [421, "717 KIDBROOK. Well Hall. \u2014 Well Hall stands at the corner of Kidbrook Lane, on the road from Woolwich to Eltham. There is a new house and the remains of an older one among the adjacent farm buildings, with a picturesque moat in the rear. The place is of venerable age, for it was described as Wellynghall in 1100, when Henry de Briset gave tbe nuns of Clerkenwell ten acres of land here for ten acres at Clerkenwell, on which he founded the Hospital of the Knights Hospitallers of St, John of Jerusalem.* In 1346, we find it spelt Wolball, and in 1428.

The road from Woolwich to Eltham did not exist, except as a bridle-path, until about 1790. t Kidbrook Lane. \u2014 Kidbrook Lane is a very old thoroughfare, and the late Mr. Greenep, who was a good authority, considered that it was the high road from Eltham to London before the Lee Boad was made. * The St. John's Ambulance Association and the spread of knowledge in theatre of giving \" first aid to the wounded \" are thus traced to this spot. t This is the date of the earliest map upon which the road appears. z z"], [422, "718 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. I cannot, however, find any evidences to support his view, the road through Lee having- existed for several centuries. Lee Road. \u2014 Mr. F. H. Hart tells me that the footpath on the Kidbrook side of the Lee Boad was formerly twelve feet wide, four feet high, and partly covered with furze and brambles ; but when the new road was made from the Tiger's Head to Eltham Green by Horton Ledger, surveyor to the New Cross Trust, in 1829, he lowered the path and used the materials to fill up the old road, which was very low and narrow, only twenty feet wide in some places. From tbe Harrow Cottages the footpath in Mr. Hart's recollection went through the meadows to Eltham Bridge, but it was purchased by the New Cross Trust in order to make the road straight, which can be seen by the old bridge baving been taken down to build a new one in a higher position. On the right-hand side from Lee Green, near the bridge, where the Eltham surveyor deposits materials for road repairs, a part of tbe old road can be seen. Mrs. Roper and Sir Thomas More. \u2014 At Well Hall in the early part of tbe sixteenth century resided Mrs. Margaret Boper (remarkable for her knowledge of Latin and Greek) eldest daughter of Sir Thomas More, Lord High Chancellor of England, who was barbarously beheaded on Tower Hill by Henry VIII. on the 6th July, 1535. It is related of Mrs. Boper that she begged her father's body, and had it interred in the chancel of Chelsea Church. His head, also, which was exposed for fourteen days on London Bridge, she procured, and it was buried on her arm at her decease in 1544, in St. Dunstan's, Canterbury. Mr. Boper,* the husband of this lady, wrote a life of Sir Thomas More, which was published at Oxford.

New Well Hall. \u2014 Sir Gregory Page of Wricklemarsh * is credited with having pulled down a great part of Well Hall, and built the newer block upon its site in 1733, with a miniature colonnade in imitation of the one that was at the splendid bouse of Wricklemarsh. Well Hall Farm. \u2014 The land surrounding Well Hall, comprising two hundred acres, was purchased by Sir Gregory in 1733. It was known as the Manor of \" East Home,\" and was for several centuries held by the Roper family. t In 1775, the property, in conjunction with Wricklemarsh, fell to Sir Gregory Page Turner. The farm was let in 1818 to Major Nichols, at about \u00a31 per acre. A Famous Watchmaker. \u2014 For many years the bouse was occupied by Mr. Arnold, watchmaker to King George III., who made a chronometer so small as to be worn in a ring on his Majesty's finger. * There is in Bunhill Fields Burial Ground, Finsbury, a large stone tomb at the grave of his mother, with this inscription : \u2014 \" Here lyes Dame Mary Page, Relict of Sir Gregory Page, Bart. , She departed this life March 11, 1728, In the 56 year of her age.

Tbe property is at present in the occupation of Mr. George Russell of Manor Farm, Plumstead, whose courtesy in permitting steeplechasing and drag-hunting over his land has been frequently acknowledged by the officers of Woolwich Garrison. The Battle of Kidbrook. \u2014 Kidbrook had a share in the strug-o-le between Henry VII. and the Cornish rebels in 1497, concerning which I quote a vigorous ballad written by Mr. Richard Ruegg in 1839 : \u2014 Down Ketbroke tbe rebel came, Wasting and burning ! * * * * # \" Arise up, my comrades, Take sire and take sword.

The \"Old Home.\"\u2014 Eltham, literally the \"Old Home,\"* was the favourite residence of the early English kings.f There remain but few evidences of its ancient grandeur, but in these there is much that will gratify the antiquarian and the student of history. All tbe interest, however, is centred in the remnant of the old palace, now known as \" Kins: John's Barn ; \" to such degradation has it sunk through cen turies of neglect. Tbe remains, how ever, attest the soundness of the old and unknown builders' handiwork, and tbe romantic bridge of four arches, Bridge over the Moat at Eltham Palace. which leads across the moat, does equal credit to the architect and workmen of King Edward IV. who constructed this approach in lieu of tbe wooden drawbridge. Ancient State. \u2014 The whole space enclosed was about an acre. Towards the west the moat is very wide, being in front of the principal face of the palace. In addition to the hall, which has oft resounded with revelry and the clang of arms, and witnessed many a gathering of all the noble and illustrious sons and daughters of old England, there were at one time seventeen sleeping rooms above stairs on the \" King's side,\" twelve others on the \" Queen's side,\" and nine on the \" Prince's side,\" with various smaller rooms. There were thirty-five \" bayes\" of building round the courtyard, containing seventy-eight apartments used as offices. There were also thirty-six rooms and two cellars below stairs.

The hall is 101 feet long, 36 feet broad, and 55 feet high. Beside two great bay windows at the upper end, there are ten others, in pairs, on each side. Tapestry. \u2014 The height of the windows from the floor was to admit of the display on the walls of magnificent arras, or tapestry, such as we now see at Hampton Court. Shakespeare refers to this custom, as when Hamlet stabs Polonius, hidden behind the arras \u2014 Dead, for a ducat ! dead ! and when Falstaff falls asleep while hiding from the sheriff : \u2014 A gross fat man, as fat as butter .... Fast asleep behind the arras and snorting like a horse. The two end windows are recessed to form the sideboards on which plate and valuables were displayed at the state banquets. These win dows, fourteen feet in breadth and ten in depth, are ornamented with beautiful tracery, in which the falcon and fetter-lock badge of Edward IV. may be traced. Through them entrance was obtained to the B,oyal rooms beyond. Underground. \u2014 About 1840 search was made for underground passages, which tradition said were carried from the old palace to Greenwich and even under the river. Stairs and shafts were discovered leading in various directions, some being merely decoy passages, while others were traced for a considerable distance. One leading to Middle Park has been explored for five hundred feet. A ring was found in the ruins about seventy years since, and is supposed to have been an amulet once worn by a crusader to the Holy Land. It bore the inscription : \u2014 Who wears me shall perform exploits, And with great joy return. Antiquity. \u2014 When and by whom Eltham Palace was built is not known. Tbis is regarded as proof of its antiquity, for had it been \"rected since the Norman Conquest there must have been some record. It is supposed to have been the residence of the early Saxon Kings, and may therefore have seen fourteen centuries. It is first mentioned in history when Edward I. kept open house here for the Christmas holi days about 1280. Edward II. made Eltham his chief residence, and Edward III. entertained at this palace his royal prisoner, King John of France, with banquets, balls and tournaments.

The Virgin Queen, \u2014 Queen Elizabeth when an infant was, bow ever, frequently taken from Greenwich to the old palace of Eltham for the benefit of the air, and she visited it again in after-life. But thence forward tbe place went to decay, and the whole property was sold in the reign of Charles I. for \u00a32,753. More recently the Government interposed to prevent its entire demolition at a time when it was pro posed to remove the carved woodwork of the roof to decorate a new college at Oxford. The Parks. \u2014 Timber from the royal parks around has helped to build many a mighty ship at Woolwich Dockyard.

St. John the Baptist, the mother church, is an ancient foundation. It was enlarged in 1767 ; the old tithe barn, in which the vicars formerly collected tithes of hay and corn, was burnt down in 1872, and the church was rebuilt in 1873-4, the old spire being replaced in 1879. Eltham is in the diocese of Rochester, and the rural deanery of Woolwich. The present vicar of the parish church is the Rev. W. J. .Sowerby. In a vault under the church are the remains of John Doggett, the comedian, who died in 1721. He instituted the coat and badge called by his name, which is annually contested on the Thames by watermen's apprentices. Holy Trinity Church, South-end, Eltham, was built in 1868. The Rev. Thomas Norman Rowsell has been tbe incumbent from the beginning. St. Peter's Church, Eltham Road, has been built about twenty years Tbe vicar is the Rev. T. Simpson.

Preaching commenced in a cottage, and a neat chapel was erected in the centre of the village in 1799. For some years the pulpit was occupied by the Rev. Mr. Wigbtman, who became a Baptist minister at Exeter. Difficulties arose, and the chapel, being badly placed at the back of some houses, was ultimately closed and converted into three cottages. The Greenwich District Associa tion of Congregational Ministers then came to the rescue and decided to build a larger chapel in a better situation. Land was taken on lease in tbe names of the Bev. T. James, of Woolwich, and Mr. W. Joynson, of St. Mary Cray, the latter of whom advanced the necessary funds, and the new church was completed and dedicated October 22nd, 1839. Supplies were obtained from Greenwich, Woolwich, &c, and for four years tbe students of Hackney College carried on the work, assisted by local friends, until in 1854 the Rev. W.

FitzHerbert Grant, R.A., who died in 1882. Eltham Park was purchased by Mr. Thomas Jackson in 1849, and occupied by him till his decease in 1884. It is still in the hands of his family. He was born at King's Norton, near Birmingham, and from a humble origin he became tbe architect of his own fortune, having attained great eminence as a railway and dock contractor. Amongst some of his undertakings in connection with his partner, Mr. Bean (subsequently of Danson, AYelling), are the construction of the Cale donian Canal, and the breakwater and harbour at Alderney, in the Channel Isles, which finally had to be abandoned as impracticable, after more than a million sterling had been spent on the work. Park Farm Place. \u2014 -This is the name of the house situate in the valley between Eltham Park and Shooters' Hill, and was at one time the residence of Sir William James, Bart., of Severndroog fame (see \"Shooters' Hill,\" page 638). It was here, on the occasion ofthe marriage of his daughter with Thomas Boothby Parkins, afterwards first Lord BanclifTe, that Sir William James, then in his sixty-fourth year, was rejoicing in the midst of his family and surrounded by troops of friends, when death, which had faced and spared him in many an hour of storm and strife, came to the gallant sailor ; he was seized with apoplexy, and died, loved, honoured, and regretted. He is buried in Eltham Churchyard in a handsome vault erected by his widow. Eltham Lodge. \u2014 Eltham Lodge was for many years held by the Shaw family, on a long lease granted by King Charles II. , at the expiration of which it reverted back to tbe Crown,* and in 1827, when the accompanying sketch was made, it was the residence of Lord Bivers. It was subsequently leased to Mr. Benjamin Wood, formerly an Alderman of the City of London, whose widow survived him for many years, and died in May, 1889, at the advanced age of ninety-seven. Avery Hill. \u2014 The mansion at Avery Hill was rebuilt and much extended by Colonel North in 1889. He at the same time diverted the old road to Bexley in front of his house, making a new road 40 feet wide, and a much easier gradient, at a co9t of \u00a35,000. The name of North, so prominently connected with this place at the present time, has old associations here. In 1597 tbe keepership ofthe Great Park and Little Park at Eltham and custody of the New Park of Home, together with the stewardship of the manor, bailiwick of the town of Eltham, and surveyorship of the woods, was granted to \"Sir Boger North, Kt., Lord North.\" * See \" Eltham Manor,\" page 390."], [437, "PLATE LXX.

But in 1636 the vestry sold all the trees on the Common for \u00a3200, and afterwards leased the land. In 1811, however, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests professed to sell to the Board of Ordnance all the manorial rights of the Crown in Eltham and Kidbrook Commons \u2014 the former con sisting of 42 acres and the latter of 11 acres. But when the Board of Ordnance attempted to encroach upon the ancient rights Murder in Kidbrook Lane, 1871. of Eltham, which was in 1815, the vestry protested, and, after a lengthened correspondence, an arrangement was made in 1822, and has since continued, by which the parishioners are allowed to dig clay and loam* on Eltham Common by payment of 20s. per annum. Kidbrook Lane Murder. \u2014 Within the parish of Eltham, but only a stone's-throw from the stream which marks the boundary of Kid brook, was perpetrated on the night of April 25th, 1871, the most atrocious and exciting crime which has come under the immediate notice of the district during the lifetime of the present generation.

It was truly murder most horrible \u2014 Other sins only speak \u2014 Murder shrieks out ! The element of water moistens the earth, But blood flies upwards, and bedews the heavens. \u2014 Webster. All London \u2014 all England, read with eager eyes the story of the foul deed committed in Kidbrook Lane ; half London and thousands of folk from distant parts paid pilgrimage to tbe spot just over the little brook in the deep secluded lane where Jane Maria Clousen met her tragic fate. Kidbrook Lane is, or was, a solitary green road turning out of tbe road between Woolwich and Eltham, close to Well-hall. It led through fields to Kidbrook and Blackheath (at which end there is now a populous neighbourhood), and it was little used except by the farmers' men even in daylight. At night it may have been regarded as quite deserted by all of humankind. But, on the evening of Tuesday, April 25th, 1871, a young man and young woman walked in loving fashion along the lane from Blackheath, and they were seen not only by a cottager resident in the lane, but by another pair of lovers who were walking there too. This was between eight and nine o'clock, and soon afterwards screams were heard, and a young man was seen to run back towards Blackheath, but no one seemed to suspect any wrong, and the murderer, for such he was, made his escape. It was not until four o'clock in tbe morning that Policeman Gunn, passing through the lane, heard groans and sobs, and found the poor girl on her hands and knees, bleeding away her life from great gashes in her head. She was taken to Guy's Hospital, where, after some days, she was recognised as a servant girl barely seven teen years of age, belonging to Greenwich, and recently in the service of Mr. Pook, printer, of that town, who formerly resided at Woolwich. She died on the last day of April, quite conscious, but unable to articulate in consequence of the shocking wounds which had maimed the organs of speech. On the day after her death Edmund Walter Pook, son of the Greenwich printer, was arrested for the murder, and thenceforward [owls Jane M. Clausen. the question of his guilt or innocence became the great question of tbe hour."], [441, "ELTHAM. 733 The young man was twenty years osage, of excellent character and good intellect, an active member of the Literary Institution, fond of taking part in amateur theatricals, and well liked by his companions. As the evidence filled columns of the papers day after day only a brief abstract of tbe case will appear in this place. Mr. Poland prosecuted for the Crown. Mr. Henry Pook, solicitor (no relative of the prisoner), defended. A surgeon from Guy's Hospital said there were a dozen wounds on the poor girl's face, and that they were probably produced by a lathing hammer like that produced. This hammer was proved to have been found on the morning after the murder in the grounds of Morden College, through which the murderer was supposed to have run towards Blackheath. There was blood upon it, but it had been hastily washed, and signs were observed at the brook in the lane where the murderer had stopped for this purpose, and to cleanse his hands from their guilty stains. The surgeon's evidence also proved that the unhappy victim had \"turned to folly and learnt that men betray.\" This fact suggested a motive for the crime, though it did not help to fix the criminal. Several female friends of the deceased were then called who had seen her just prior to the murder, and related the statements she had made. These were to the effect that she was about to be married to young Mr. Pook and that she was o-oincr to meet him on the Tuesday night to make arrangements. Thomas Lazells, who lived at the cottage in Kidbrook Lane said that on the evening of the murder, about seven o'clock, he saw young Mr. Pook, the prisoner, walk along the lane with his arm round a young woman, but the witness admitted that he had only seen the prisoner twice during twelve months and had never spoken to him. The young man and woman previously mentioned, who saw the murderer and his victim in the lane, heard the screams and saw a man running away, were also called, hut could not say that the prisoner was the man they had seen. Evidence was also given to show that the lath hammer was bought at the shop of Mr. Thomas, at High Street, Deptford, but by a man who did not resemble the accused. It was further stated that on the night of the murder young Pook entered the shop of a confectioner, Mrs. Plane, at Royal Hill, Greenwich, and borrowed a clothes brush, that his trousers were dirty, and that in explanation of his warm appearance he said he had run from the Lewisham Road. The evidence of the police-officers who searched the house of the prisoner's father was very much criticised. When arrested, the prisoner informed them that on the Tuesday night in question he had been to Lewisham to see a lady, but had not seen her, and that he had not met the servant, Jane Clousen, since she left his father's house. The police asked him for the clothes which he wore that night and took what he gave them, including a shirt which had blood-stains on the wrist. These he said had been caused by a scratch. There were also spots of blood upon his hat and trousers and a long hair Hke deceased's was upon the latter. There was no blood upon the coat which the prisoner gave up, and it was suggested that all the stains might have been results of injuries which the young man suffered during an epileptic fit. A feature in the case was the appearance of Miss Alice Durnford, of Lewisham, a young lady to whom the prisoner had intimated that he was paying his addresses. It was to watch a supposed rival that he had, he said, gone to Lewisham on the night of the murder. Her evidence was not very material to the case. 3 A"], [442, "734 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. At the inquest at Guy's Hospital the jury, by a majority of sixteen to six, found a verdict against the prisoner, and he was also committed for trial on the capital charge by Mr. Maude at Greenwich Police Court, but at the trial in the Central Criminal Court on July 15th, the presiding judge ridiculed the evidence for the prosecution, everybody abused the police, and the jury found the prisoner \"Not Guilty.\" And so for a time at least has ended the most memorable trial with which I have ever had to do, and thus seems to end all hope of un ravelling a mystery and crime which have had no parallel in our generation. Perhaps the murderer still stalks abroad, with the guilt upon his head and the fear of discovery ever in his heart, but the wretch who could conceive and execute a crime so heinous is hardly likely to be troubled witb many qualms. A tablet to the memory of Jane Maria Clousen was a short time since to be seen in a mason's yard at New Cross. It was the result of a public subscription which fell short ofits object. The inscription upon it was as follows : \u2014 In Memory of JANE MARIA CLOUSEN, a Motherless Girl, who was murdered in Kidbrook Lane on the night of Tuesday the 25th of April, 1871. She was taken to Guy's Hospital where she died on Sunday night the 30th April, Aged 17 years. She was gentle and respectful in manner, amiable and affectionate in disposition. Her last words were \"Oh! Let me die.\" May God's great pity touch his heart and lead My murderer to confess his dreadful deed ; That when the deeds of all our hearts are known, Guilt and repentance may alike be shown."], [443, "CHAPTER LVI. SOME MEMORABLE EVENTS. Many remarkable occurrences appear upon the face of these records, forming for the most part the chain of incidents upon which our history has been strung. The following sketches narrate briefly some other events which could not fitly appear among the foregoing chapters, though they may hereafter be fitly incorporated within the ordinary rolls and annals of the local log-book. They are now, for mere convenience' sake, presented in separate form, and with little attempt at arrangement. Royal Visits. \u2014 Of Royal visits many have been recounted, and of such, it is needless to say, there have been many more, not only by members of the reigning family of this country, but by nearly every sovereign of Europe, and of even more distant lands. But in a few special instances the desire to make an impression (probably for reasons of State) rendered such occasions particularly remarkable. The greatest of these was \u2014 The Visit of the Shah of Persia. \u2014 It was on the 21st of June, 1873, and the longest day was none too long for all the grand doings at Woolwich on the occasion of this memorable visit of the Persian sovereign. The Shah was, for high political motives, not difficult at the time to fathom, received by this country with all possible honour and attention, and every effort was made to impress him with the wondrous works of Woolwich. It was Saturday, and fine weather graced a general holiday. Great numbers of the public were admitted to the Royal Arsenal, stands were erected in all manner of places, and the roads were lined with tbe visitors and workmen. Woolwich was never so crowded before, and it was estimated from the traffic returns by rail and river that the assembly was double that of any previous juncture. The Shah drove down from Buckingham Palace, and was accompanied by the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Connaught (then Prince Arthur), Mr. Cardwell, Sir John Pakington, and other officials. Tbe party arrived at twelve and saw no part of the Arsenal except the Gun Factories ; the Shah, having 3 A2"], [444, "736 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. come without bis breakfast, dispensed with tbe other departments in obedience to bis appetite.* REFERENCES TO PORTRAITS, PLATE P. 136.

A Royal Drink. \u2014 That which he did see was sufficiently trying under such circumstances, and at the ten-ton hammer, the heat arising from the furnace and the white-hot metal under the big hammer made him call for a drink. His cup-bearer was not at hand with the custo mary sherbet, and the only available vessel was a half-pint pewter pot used by the Vulcans of the forge, and in this His Majesty was fain to quench his thirst, which he did with an amused smile and a nod of thanks. He was afterwards entertained at a splendid luncheon in the Royal Artillery messroom, and in the afternoon witnessed a grand review of Artillery on Woolwich Common. The Czar. \u2014 Another momentous day for Woolwich was that on which tbe Emperor of Russia (Alexander II.) visited the Royal Arsenal, took luncheon at the Royal Artillery barracks, and witnessed a great review on the Common. It was \"Wednesday, May the 20th, 1874. The streets were crowded with people, and the authorities of the Arsenal courteously provided stands for their numerous visitors. His august Majesty (who was afterwards so foully murdered in his own capital) was accompanied by the Grand Duke Alexis, and escorted by the Prince of Wales, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Cambridge, Prince Christian, and tbe Duke of Teck. Prince Arthur was present as Captain in charge of two troops of the 7th Hussars. The Arsenal was the perfection of order. Everything had been polished or painted, the roads had been sanded, and the place was at its best show form. Through all the departments the Emperor threaded his way for two hours without apparent fatigue, and then drove to tbe Royal Artillery messroom with tbe Prince of Wales and the rest to luncheon. Tbe troops reviewed consisted entirely of Artillery, and there were ninety four guns on the field. The Gladstone Day. \u2014 Perhaps no date in our local history is moro notable than that of Saturday, Jan. 31st, 1874, a day to be remembered as the occasion of the greatest political gathering Woolwich has seen, for it was on that day William Ewart Gladstone, Premier of Great Britain, delivered his famous election speech in Beresford Square before twenty thousand people. Although the right hon. gentleman had represented the constituency as part of the borough of Greenwich since 1868, this was his first official visit \u2014 the only previous record of his being at Woolwich appearing on July 16th, 1862, when, with Lord Palmerston and other distinguished persons, he was present at a fete given by the Viceroy of Egypt on board his state yacht at the Royal Arsenal. It was only three days the day of election, and not alone the town and the borough, but the whole nation, were excited by tbe"], [448, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 738 event of Mr. Gladstone's appearance, thousands of people coming down from London to see the world-renowned statesman, and listen to his marvellous oratory. A hustings was erected on a garden plot at the corner of the square nearest Green's End (now covered by the Elephant and Castle tavern), and there were desks in front, at which worked forty reporters. Mr. Gladstone drove from his town resi dence accompanied by his wife and daughter, and when he reached Lower Market Street, the horses were removed, and fifty workmen from the Royal Arsenal proudly drew their illustrious repre sentative to the rendezvous. Mr. Gladstone spoke for Mr. Gladstone, J 'runt photo by Elliot and Fry. an hour on the topics of the day, chiefly relating to the criticisms of bis great antagonist, Mr. Disraeli, and, although there was at first some opposition, the right hon. gentleman's reception was royal and triumphant. On the day of election, Mr. Gladstone was again returned to Parliament with Mr. T. W. Boord, but he left the borough at the general election of 1880 to fight for his party in Mid-Lothian. The Specials of 1867. \u2014 Patriotic fervour, somewhat akin to the enthusiasm displayed on behalf of the Liberal chieftain, invoked the special constables of '67. In December, 1867, the first of the Fenian explosions destroyed the wall of Clerkenwell Prison, but did not succeed in its object, which was to aid tbe escape of a noted convict. The Government, startled by the occurrence, sanctioned the establishment throughout the country of a special constabulary, and the manhood of England came forward to be enrolled in this vigilance guard. Five thousand of them were sworn in by the magistrates at Woolwich, with Mr. H. Shersby as superinten dent, Mr. G. Hudson as assistant, and Captain Elliott and Mr. J. Edwards as deputy-superintendents. A large number of these attesta-"], [449, "MEMORABLE EVENTS. 739 tions were also made by Arsenal workmen in the model room of the Royal Laboratory. The following is the oath which was administered, and it is worth preserving as a curiosity, together with the special constable staff and armlet, which some have kept in remembrance of the scare : \u2014 \" lj 7 do swear that I will well and truly serve our Sovereign Lady the Queen in the office of special constable for the parishes of Plumstead, Woolwich, Charlton, Eltham, and the Liherty of Mottingham, without favour or affection, malice or ill-will ; and that I will to the hest of my power cause the peace to he kept and preserved, and prevent all offences against the persons and properties of Her Majesty's subjects, and that whilst I continue to hold the said office, I will, to the hest of my skill and knowledge, discharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to law. So help me God.\" Swearing in Special Constables in Royal Laboratory. The specials were called upon for very little duty on this occasion, and when a similar call was made at tbe time of the Trafalgar Square riots in 1887, Woolwich was omitted. Tumult. \u2014 Occasions on which our own peace has been disturbed have been happily few and not very perilous. Even with the trouble some but harmless eruption of Plumstead Common, already related, there is nothing very serious to record in the way of local riots, but we have had a few little affairs of the sort which may here be appended. We read that \u2014 In the year 1730 a prize-fight was \"being held at the Tower alehouse (prohahly in Warren Lane, \"behind Rupert's Tower), and an officer of the Dockyard had words concerning the fighting with one of the Train of Artillery, who gave him several blows with liis list. The other said he would fight him with swords, or any one of the"], [450, "740 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. Train ; upon which several of the Matrosses knocked him down, and, running out of the door with their swords drawn, swore they would kill all the Townsmen they came near. All this created much indignation and commotion, the drummers beat to arms, and the Artillery Company marched up from the Warren m a warlike manner. The Riot Act was read, and orders given to fire on the people, but not obeyed. Four files of musketeers, however, were ordered to march round the town and to make everybody go indoors, and if they refused, to \" knock them down. This instruction they obeyed so implicitly that the \" parish constable and his watch ordered them to their barracks, which they not only refused, but stabbed one of the watch, Mr. Thomas Smith, in the left breast.\" The Gentleman's Magazine of April, 1757, says\u2014 A strong party of the Guards marched from St. James's Park to Woolwich to quiet the disturbance of the workmen in that yard, who to the number of 150 have thrown down their tools and refused to work. This disturbance was temporarily allayed, but it broke out again a month later. A newspaper reports under date of \u2014 May, 1757.\u2014 Yesterday a detachment of 400 men belonging to the footguards marched to Woolwich to quell the riotous workmen in that Dockyard. It seems it has been the custom of these workmen to take away the chips they make as oiten as they go to their meals, but tins, like most other customs, has been greatly abused ; for under the denomination of chips they take away large solid pieces of real use and value ; and many of these they quite load themselves with, three or four times a day, and secret among it large nails and pieces of iron, part of the King's stores ; a stop being put to this practice was the occasion of much grumbling and dissention, and increased into a story that they would not work any longer till they received their wages ; this plausible pretext has made them very riotous and 'tis feared must end in some mischief. But in the month of March, 1770, we read \u2014 March 9th, 1770. \u2014 Wednesday last being the birthday of the Earl of Egmont, the morning was ushered in at Woolwich by the ringing of bells ; flags and colours were displayed, and every possible demonstration of joy was shown on the occasion by the shipwrights, &c. The reason is that a few years since an attempt was made to debar the shipwrights from taking away their daily load of chips, but which his lordship got secured to them, as also a salary of \u00a320 per annum for such as might become incapable ; whereas they formerly were dismissed as soon as they became incapable, and left to the care of the parish. The chip privilege was, however, abolished not many years after, Buffaloes and Hyenas. \u2014 When ships were paid off at Woolwich, in tbe \" good old days \" of wars and prize-money, there were frequent fights. We find the following report under date of \u2014 April 8th, 1773. On Thursday evening a quarrel arose between some ot the crew of the Buffalo man-of-war and the Hyena frigate at Woolwich, when a desperate battle ensued in which three of the Buffalo's men had three arms broke, and the Hyena's men terribly bruised. On Friday they landed in number upwards of 100, armed with bludgeons, pokers, &c, and paraded the streets threatening revenue on the Hyena's people ii any came ashore. The cook's mate went ashore and was killed by them. On Saturday all was quiet, but on Sunday a party of both ships met at the"], [451, "741 MEMORABLE EVENTS. Jolly Tar, a public-house near the church, where they renewed the action, and six of the Buffalo's men were so much bruised that they are not expected to live, and ten of the others were taken on board the Buffalo sorely bruised. Murphy Riots. \u2014 We now step down nearly a hundred years to \"the Murphy riots.\" Mr. William Murphy was a self-elected apostle of Protestantism, and he went up and down preaching a hot crusade against the Roman Catholics, vowing that he was ready to lay down his life, as his father had done, for bis faith, which at length unhappily he did, being stoned to death by some brutal colliers in Monmouthshire. Amongst other strongholds ofthe enemy he invaded Woolwich, and for a fortnight in 1870 (April 4 to 18) tbe town was in a lively state. The Irish Catholics were as ready as be for battle, but they did not stop at furious criticism, tantalising lectures, and irritating pamphlets. They attacked him with curses and groans, and sticks and stones, ani every night the whole of Beresford Street, from the lecturer's lodging at the one end to the Lecture Hall at the other, was in a terrible disorder. Mr. Murphy as well as bis opponents had his sympathisers, who guarded him to and fro, but the disturbance got worse every night, and at last a whole squadron of mounted police and a battalion of foot constables were required for the public safety. Only two or three people were arrested and fined, one man was sent to prison for a month, and when Mr. Murphy took his departure for other fields, quiet returned like a sweet sleep. A Godly Death. \u2014 Let us conclude this chapter by narrating the solemn and saintly story of the death of Rector Brown. Hale, vigorous, and cheerful, no stranger would have suspected the Rev. Canon Brown's seventy years as he walked to his accustomed duties at the parish church of St. Mary, Woolwich, on the first May Sabbath of 1875. He took his seat in the chancel while the prayers were offered by bis curate, the Rev. F. S.

Moore, the sexton, followed, and to him the rector complained of faintness, for which remedies were at once procured. The rector's eldest son and other members of tbe family also left the church, and tbe good divine stood at the open porch awhile to get air, but death had stricken him, and he peacefully breathed away bis life in tbe loving arms of his kindred and friends. He died in the sanctuary which he loved, with the robes of his holy office about him.

The hazardous operations incidental to the Royal Arsenal doubtless answer for many of the sad accidents which have embittered our local history, and a full proportion of the crimes which have horrified us have certainly been the work of casual"], [456, "744 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. residents and strangers. Yet, with every allowance for peculiar causes, the list of sad events which I have drawn up in tbe following pages, added to those already reviewed in their inseparable connection with localities, make up a fearfully heavy roll of affliction to place to our account. Gigantic Disasters. \u2014 Remembering that the greatest calamity that has afflicted the whole nation within our time, the wreck of the Princess Alice, occurred at our very doors, and brought upon the town of Woolwich a sorrow, a duty, and a reputation, which will never be forgotten ; that the most fearful explosion of gunpowder ever known occurred close by, and yet not in, the Government works ; and that many other \u2014 the majority \u2014 of our records under this head have been \" sensations \" in their day \u2014 remembering all this, it will be hard to find another locality with a chronicle so dread. The explosions alone would make up a long catalogue, and tbis without going beyond tbe living generation. There were, indeed, very sew accidents of the kind until the busy years about the middle of the present century, and those I have incorporated with the ordi nary historical records of tbe public works in which they may have occurred. Slight accidents, of which there have not been many \u2014 for explosions are seldom slight \u2014 are scarcely included in the category, and I think the following series will comprise the whole of those which have been attended with serious consequences. A Lesson Dearly Taught. \u2014 At ten o'clock on the morning of Wednesday, September 17th, 184-5, an explosion was heard in the Laboratory Department of the Royal Arsenal, followed by a cry of fire. The calamity was found to have occurred in a small building near the southern end of the model-room, the work on hand being the breaking up of unserviceable fuzes. Mr. Carlisle, master turner, was one of the first on tbe spot, but found the doors shut, and it was only with great force that they were burst open, and then was witnessed the horrible sight of seven dead bodies lying in a heap close to the entrance. The doors opened inwards and all the poor fellows at work in tbe building miserably perished in their attempt to escape. The engines were called, and the fire was extinguished without damage to any other workshop than the one in which it originated. Tbe inquest was held at the Mortar Tavern by Mr. C. Carttar, coroner, and a jury of twenty inhabitants, with Mr. Matthew Smith for their foreman, was empanelled. Seven Dead. \u2014 The bodies when viewed presented a fearful sight, being badly burnt. The names of the victims were John Crake, master rocket-maker, who had been upwards of fifty years in the service ; Henry Butters, sen., Henry Butters, jun. (his son), Robert Burbage,"], [457, "EXPLOSIONS. 745 Michael Purtill, and two youths named Samuel Rendley and Alexander Leonard. Colonel Cockburn, Director of tbe Royal Laboratory, gave evidence at the inquest, but the principal witness was \u2014 Lieutenant A. Oldfield, R.A., who was engaged with a party under instruction at the Royal Arsenal. He said that on the morning of the explosion, shortly before ten o'clock, he visited the room in which the men were at work breaking up unserviceable fuzes, and saw several of them taken to pieces. The method was to cut with a copper knife the string which fastened the paper folded over the cap end of the fuze, and disengage the paper, which was done by the principal man, Crake. The fuze was then handed to a boy to take out the meal powder, after wliich it was passed to a man to break up, which was done by means of a steel chisel erected in a block of wood, on the end of which the fuze was placed and struck by a wooden mallet to split it in two and afterwards into quarters, when the composition was taken out and thrown into pans of water. The block of wood in which the chisel was placed was standing in a copper pan. The floor was of stone, wet all over, and the men had hides to stand on. He noticed large quantities of composition in pans of water. The room had folding doors and both were wide open when he left . In a few minutes after he left he heard two distinct explosions, and saw that the doors had been found closed. About thirty thousand fuzes had been broken up there during the previous month. He saw two men breaking up the fuzes and one of them put first one end and then the other upon the chisel and strike it each time, which he understood was wrong to do, as the small end only should have been put upon the chisel to prevent any grains of meal powder coming in contact with the steel. Colonel Cockburn said the fuzes had been sent home damaged from Gibraltar, and were broken up to save the saltpetre, which was of value to the Government. They were ten-inch fuzes. The smaller ones were usually buried, not being worth the trouble of breaking up. (They were, of course, wooden fuzes.) The method adopted was the best he knew, but the small end only should have been put upon the chisel. He would have no objection to breaking up a thousand so. Steel chisels were not always used but the foreman Crake preferred them. The witness added that he thought the accident had been caused by an ignition of the accumulated meal powder. Lieutenant-Colonel Dansey, R.A., fire-master at the Laboratory, gave the like evidence, and said that after the powder was removed there was little danger in the fuze, the composition not being so inflammable or likely to ignite by concussion. The men worked ten hours daily and destroyed about three thousand fuzes a day. Doors usually opened outwards hi rooms where powder was used, but this room was only in temporary occupation. Benjamin Rowland, a foreman, who supplied the fuzes to be broken up, and William Field, a labourer, who removed the fragments, gave evidence, the latter saying that he had frequently seen the fuzes split from the cap end. William Caffin, Esq., deputy storekeeper, Royal Laboratory, said if he had seen men so acting he should not have allowed it. He did not regard the steel chisel as particu larly hazardous, for sparks had been seen to fly from copper hoops when driven on to a wooden barrel. Much more work could be done with a steel chisel than with a copper one. The jury consulted in private, and returned a verdict that the accident arose from circumstances of which they had no knowledge, but they recommended that the steel chisel should be discarded for a copper knife, and that men should not be employed upon such work wearing nailed boots."], [458, "746 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Colonel Cockburn said he would in future have the composition boiled before removal. Funeral. \u2014 The funerals of all but Crake took place on tbe Sunday after the accident, and all were buried in tbe parish churchyard of Wool wich, except Kendley, who was interred in the ground at the Wesleyan chapel. Crake had a public funeral on the following Wednesday, and all the expenses attending the interments were borne by the Government. It was stated that there had been no previous explosion of a fatal cha racter since 1814, when four persons were killed during the preparation of fireworks for the peace rejoicings, but that there had been several explosions not of a serious nature, Crake having himself, on more than one occasion, averted evil consequences by his presence of mind. Crake's widow was awarded by the Government \u00a325 per annum, the widows of the Butterses, father and son, were allowed 14s. per week, and Burbage's widow 9s. per week. Gratuities were given to the friends of the others. Rocket Shed Explosion. \u2014 Ten years passed, and the next serious explosion took place at twenty minutes past eleven on the morning of Monday, December -3rd, 1855. Tbe accident originated in one of the rocket sheds in the East Laboratory, and communicated with a mealing shed adjacent, both standing in the midst of a number of such sheds near the canal-end. The ruins ignited, and several of the sufferers were fearfully burnt before they were extricated. Eight of them were con vejred to the Royal Ordnance Hospital, there being at that time no sufficient accommodation at the Royal Arsenal medical establishment, and the spectacle, first at the rocket sheds and then in the hospital, made a painful and ineffaceable impression on my meniorv. Four Victims. \u2014 The following died of their injuries \u2014 the two first named on the day of the explosion : \u2014 Henry Stephen Langham, aged 25, foreman of the rocket sheds ; John Kirwin, 40, labourer in the mealing shed ; James Wallace, 25, labourer in rocket shed ; and Thomas Holland, 40, labourer, mealing shed. The inquest was held at the Old Gun Tavern, and the evidence showed without doubt that the explosion was caused by the ignition of a Hale war rocket while the putty was being \"rymed\" out of the holes in the base. The rymer was a small gouge of steel, and the witnesses stated that copper and brass had been tried but would not answer the purpose. About thirty-four Hale's rockets were supposed to have been in the shed which first exploded, and in the mealing shed were about one hundred lbs. of powder, each of the seven men employed there having seventeen lbs. served out for his day's work. Thomas Wheelwright, one'of the injured men, was examined in bed at the hospital, and said that he was boring out the holes of a 10-lb. rocket with a tool like a bradawl"], [459, "747 EXPLOSIONS. when it suddenly flew out of his hand alight, but he could not tell what fired it. He blamed the steel rymer for the accident, and said he had often expressed a wish to have copper or brass tools, which would do just as wyell. The men were allowed to go into the sheds with their boots on, and he had hobnails in his boots. The floor was never wetted, and there was always composition scattered about by the sifting. Captain E. M. Boxer, R.A., superintendent of the Laboratory department, after wards gave evidence. The rockets in question were, he said, experimental, as the making of Hale's rockets had been for some time discontinued, and was now being resumed. The ryming instrument had been in use for forty years and had never been objected to. A very hard metal was required to stand the work. It was possible that if driven in too far when clearing out the holes it might strike against the wrought-iron side of the rocket. The work was necessarily dangerous. It was always possible that such accidents might happen, but fifty years might pass without another. All the instruments used in making rockets were of steel. He thought it was an error to suppose that brass or copper tools would be safer, for the ignition of gunpowder might be caused by friction or pressure even with tools of wood or lead. Steel would take a very sharp edge and therefore require less pressure and friction. It was, he said, a singular fact that all the accidents which had occurred in the making of rockets at the Arsenal, so far as the causes had been traced, were proved to have originated in the compression of gunpowder by gun-metal tools. The sheds were new, and only temporary, lt was hardly possible to get all steady men for the work, as before the war broke out there were only two hundred men in the department and now there were three thousand five hundred. The foreman Langham was a steady and trustworthy man. The practice of men going into the sheds wdth hobnail boots on was decidedly wrong, and the composition ought not to have been sifted in the finishing shed where the explosion occurred. In all the mealing sheds the men wore slippers, but in the rocket sheds this was not thought necessary. There was a rule to keep the floors watered. The establishment was not yet well organized, but steps were being taken to put it on a proper footing. By the jury. The men were paid 14s. a week and worked about eight hours a day, and each had to do a certain amount of work. Mr. William Tozer, superintendent of composition, and some other witnesses, having been called, The jury after a two-days' enquiry returned a verdict that \"the explosion was caused by the use of an improper tool in the finishing of a rocket. The jury are of opinion that due precaution has not been taken by the authorities in the supervision of the tools in use and also in not providing slippers for the use of the men employed in the rocket sheds. The jury are also of opinion that the sheds are placed too near to each other, and that the processes of sifting and finishing ought not to be carried on in the same shed.\" Penalties of Peace. \u2014 Two explosions occurred at the Royal Arsenal in May, 1856, both due to the hurry of preparations for the peace rejoicings at the close of the Crimean War. The first of these was on Tuesday, May 6th, at a quarter-past seven in the evening, and took place in one of several newly-erected corrugated sheds in the Royal Laboratory Square. Twenty-one persons were at work in this shed, preparing turbillon rockets, when one ignited, probably from the friction of the \" rymer \" used to bore holes in the composition. Fortunately, the doors were hung on india-rubber hinges and afforded a ready means of egress, but nine men and three boys were more or less in-"], [460, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 748 jured, and were taken to the Royal Ordnance Hospital. One of these, William Powell, died ten days afterwards, and at the inquest it was explained that he was working at a lathe on a 10-lb. turbillon, when it exploded and fired one hundred bags of squibs, and a quantity of star- Hghts. Twenty Thousand Squibs.\u2014 There were twenty thousand squibs ! The doors were without fastenings and flew open. The rymer was of steel and was said to have got heated at the work, and the men had frequently to be cautioned to cool it in water. Captain Boxer, the superintendent, said steel was in his opinion the proper metal for boring, as it had to cut through paper, and would not involve so much force or friction as a tool which was not very keen. Many new hands had been put on to pre pare these fireworks. Mr. William Tozer, foreman of the composition sheds, gave similar testimony and said the men had to do a fair day's work, but were not overtasked. The jury sat for two days at the Old Gun Tavern (which stood on the site ofthe Catholic Schools in New\" Road) and returned a verdict \" That William Powell died from injuries received by the explosion of a turbillon rocket, upon which he was operating with a tool or drill, and the jury deeply lament that an operation attended with so much danger should be carried on in a shed where so many articles of a com bustible nature are being manufactured ; and the jury strongly recommend that men only of known skill should be employed in these dangerous operations.\" Another Explosion. \u2014 The second explosion was on Saturday, the 17th of May, 1856, and the same jury investigated both cases. Tbe scene of this accident was also the Laboratory Square, the explosion occurring in the percussion-cap composition shed, and the victims were Mr. William Flack, the foreman, and a workman named Taylor. Captain Boxer was the chief witness at the inquest and described the composition and the work. The shed was close to his office, but he left the work entirely to Mr. Flack, who had been fifteen years engaged in it and had his utmost confidence. He went into the shed to speak to Flack about ten minutes before the explosion. The work was dangerous, but not more so than many other operations, and he was quite unable to explain how it was caused ; there was not more than thirty pounds of com position in the shed. Captain Boxer also announced that this and similar processes would soon be removed from the Laboratory Square to the \" Marshes.\" At this announcement the jury expressed satisfaction, and they returned a verdict of \" Acci dental death.\" The next catastrophe, passing over the Erith disaster already related, was in the East Laboratory, or Composition Buildings, situate in the walled enclosure at the eastern end of the Royal Arsenal, spoken of in the enquiry just noted as \" the Marshes,\" but on the inner side of the canal. The Deed of a Thoughtless Boy. \u2014 Nothing more sorrowful in the nature of an explosion has ever occurred at Woolwich tban that"], [461, "EXPLOSIONS. 749 which played havoc among the boys in the East or Lower Laboratory on the .5th of October, 1867. In one respect, in its origin, it stands almost alone among explosions, for the cause was clearly traced, whereas the rule in such cases is mystery and doubt, or at most, vague conjecture. The site ofthe Lower Laboratory was \"the Island\" formed by the canal in the eastern part of the Arsenal, and the buildings were a number of cartridge sheds of the usual class, about 60 feet by 30 feet, and 30 feet apart. They formed a neat street ; all built of brick with corrugated iron roofs, and the whole were enclosed by a high wall. Fifty-five in Peril. \u2014 In one of these buildings, No. 6, fifty-five boys were at work on Saturday, October 5th, making blank cartridges for the Snider rifle. Work benches ran round the walls, while other benches were arranged crossways, and at all these busy hands were filling and \"crimping\" the new Boxer cartridge. The cases pro vided at that time contained the percussion cap, fixed in tbe base, and the boys were supplied with naked pellets of powder previously compressed, and these they had to insert in the cases, and then crimp tbe top by a slight squeeze of the hand. There was never much powder allowed in the workshop, but some of the pellets got broken, and it was calculated that there was about thirty-two pounds altogether on the tables, exclusive of the filled cartridges, very few of which exploded. The presence of a percussion cap in the base of each case rendered the work hazardous, but it was not thought that one of these could be fired without extreme violence, and that such violence was scarcely possible by any theory except the unlikely one of an intentional blow. This, however, was just what happened, as was afterwards shown. The explosion originated in a corner to the left of the principal door, and in this corner were twelve boys at work. They had only a small supply of pellets before them, and many of the other lads had ceased work, as tbe hour was near to end the week's labour. It was ten minutes to eleven when a rumbling noise told the tale, and all the Arsenal ran out of tbe workshops in alarm. Those who were near heard, first, a noise like the crack of a percussion cap, and then a bang, and then a series of small explosions as the fire ran round and across the benches. The windows were blown out, and through them and the doors the poor lads endeavoured to escape. Many were successful, and, the doors being constructed to open outwards, nearly all might have been saved but for a blunder in fitting the gaslights outside the building in such a manner as to prevent the doors from being fully opened. Twenty-four Burnt. \u2014 Half ofthe little fellows were burnt, and 3b"], [462, "750 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. twenty -four were conveyed to the Arsenal Infirmary. In the shop were two overlookers, a storekeeper, and William Brown, the foreman, whose conduct was highly commended, for he refused to leave the burning shop until every boy was out, and saved several himself, groping about in the fire and smoke, and dragging out some who were insensible and burning. The workmen outside tore the smouldering canvas garments from the bodies and limbs of the sufferers, some of whom were fearfully scorched. The inadequate accommodation at the Infirm ary was painfully demonstrated by this accident, and its enlargement some time afterwards was the consequence. There were only nine beds, some of which were occupied by other patients, who were at once sent home, and, with the help of bedding from the Herbert Hospital, fourteen in all were provided for, the remainder being attended to at their resi dences. Five Deaths. \u2014 'Three deaths occurred within the first day or so and two others afterwards. The names of the victims were Walter Pigge, Hubert Newby, Garret M'Callaghan, Henry Thomas Webb, and Charles Reightley. At the inquest, which occupied several days, and was adjourned from time to time over several weeks, the first witness was \u2014 Colonel Boxer, superintendent of the Royal Laboratory, who described the process in which the boys were engaged. There were at the time about sixty millions of cart ridges made in a year. He said that since the accident the doors and windows had been made to open freely and the workpeople had been supplied with woollen garments instead of canvas. William Brown, the foreman, said he heard the snap of a cap at the end table and saw the powder blow up. He called out \" Fall down,\" and fell on his face, by which means he was unhurt in the explosion, but he was afterwards burnt in assist ing the boys out. As the injured lads got well enough they were seen by the jury in the Infirmary and gave their evidence. The most important witness was a lad named John Lee, who (his life being despaired of) had made his deposition before Mr. Traill, the magis trate, while under fear of death. He said : \" I was standing at the end of the shop, and Pigge stood on my left. I can tell you how the explosion occurred. Pigge took a mallet and hit the cap. It did not go off and he hit it a second time, when it went off. He said first of all that he was going to hit the cap, and I said, ' Don't hit it, Pigge.' The cap which he had struck had fallen out of one of the cases.\" Dr. Briscoe said that the boy Pigge was badly burnt all over and was the first who died. Other evidence, tending to corroborate that of Lee, was adduced, and the jury, on the 13th of November, came to the following verdict :\u2014 \" That the deaths were occasioned by an explosion caused by the act of Walter Pigge, who, with a mallet, struck and caused to explode a percussion cap, but the jury believe such act to have been not maliciously done. The jury regret that the means of egress from the build ing were to a great extent impeded by the erection of fixed gas appliances outside the doors of the building ; and in conclusion they hope that better hospital accommoda tion will be as soon as possible provided.\""], [463, "751 EXPLOSIONS. Explosion not of Gunpowder. \u2014 Explosions have arisen from many causes other than gunpowder \u2014 gas, steam, fire-damp, fermenta tion, and even from the ignited dust of a flour-mill \u2014 but those which have happened at Woolwich have all originated from \"villanous salt petre\" in one or other of its compounds,* with the exception of the mishap which befell a \"Whitehead\" or \"fish\" torpedo on Saturday, the 24th of January, 1874, in which case a lamentable disaster was produced by nothing more dreadful than the air we breathe. The Fish Torpedo.\u2014 The \" fish \" torpedo had only recently been brought out, and the Government, satisfied of its marvellous powers of attacking ships, had purchased the patent at an enormous sum of Mr. Whitehead. t Its secret was preserved with the utmost vigilance, and the trials took place at that time in the short length of the Arsenal canal, near the middle gates, a shed being erected over a small jetty to conceal the machine and its method of launching.? All that observers on the bank could see was a body of steel, twelve feet long by one foot in diameter, darting like a big fish through the water, but it was well known that the motive power was supplied by a small pair of engines in the body of the thing actuated by a store of compressed air abaft. The practice was to charge the torpedos with air at the Royal Laboratory and bring them down to the range on trucks. This had just been done with one of them, and it was standing inside the open door of the launching shed, when the air chamber exploded with a violent sound. A young man, named Herbert Edward Baker, who was standing in rear, was carried twenty yards away, and one of his legs, with part of the body, blown into the timber field fifty yards behind ; but, by great mercy, his was the only death. A man named Fishenden was, however, seriously injured, and several were wounded, while many more had marvellous escapes, including Mr. Miller, chief engineer, R.N., who was superintending the work. The cause of the explosion was the weakness of the diaphragm, or front wall, of the air chamber, which gave way, but as it had been previously tested up to 1,200 lbs. on the square inch, it could hardly have been expected to break down under a pressure of 1,000 lbs. per inch, which was all that it had to endure when the accident happened. Tbe hinder part of the torpedo was found forty yards in rear. At the inquest, which was concluded on February 21st, Fishenden and the other injured men were witnesses. Mr. Miller, Mr. R. Low, * I do not include in the category of explosions the bursting of a machine for bending timber, which happened at the Dockyard in 1812.

Milward also gave evidence, and the jury returned a ver dict of \" accidentally killed,\" expressing perfect satisfaction with the conduct of all concerned. Gun-Cotton Explosion. \u2014 Charles Young, a foreman of long experience, and John Walstow, his assistant, were victims of science. Their lives were sadly sacrificed on the 24th of May, 1875, through the overweening confidence enjoyed by the deadly but deceptive gun cotton, an explosion occurring under circumstances which nobody considered in the least degree hazardous, and from causes which could never be determined. Gun-cotton, we bad been taught to believe, could not explode without a detonator, and yet, without a detonator it did explode, and Young and Walstow paid for the lesson with their lives. So little was the gun-cotton dreaded that they were working with it in the open workshop of the cap factory, amongst a number of others engaged in ordinary labour. Their duty was to charge some shells with tbe gun-cotton for experimental purposes, and they were using a hydraulic press to fill a 7-inch Palliser, when the shell burst. Young was killed on the spot, and Walstow died next morning. A third man named Barton, who was at the press, was also hurt, but not dangerously, and it was a miracle that other persons, of whom there were forty-eight on the same floor and a hundred on the floor below, were not involved in the disaster. But they all knew what had happened, and despite assurances of safety, had long dreaded it. The universal cry was, \" The gun-cotton at last ! \" At the incpiest, the injured man Barton was a witness, and said he was attending to the hydraulic press under Walstow's orders. Walstow put some pressure on in ramming the gun-cotton into the shell and said to Young, \" The drift does not seem to go down.\" Young answered, \" See how your pump is leaking,\" and then the explosion took place. The drift was a steel bar fifteen inches long and one and a half inches thick. Mr. Robert Pollock, foreman of the small-arm branch, Royal Laboratory, said the work was under his charge, and thought it was possible that the drift had been over driven. Professor Abel said he found some of the granulated gun-cotton on the floor, and that it was in a wet state and uninflammable. He believed, however, that the drift had squeezed the moisture out of some part of the cotton in the shell, and also created friction with the shell, which would have engendered a great heat. Under such circumstances the gun-cotton would ignite and smoulder, but gas and steam would generate, and, the shell being perfectly closed by the drift, the shell would ultimatelv explode. Only three shells had been charged there, but the compression of gun cotton into discs had been carried on for ten years in the room below, without any thought of danger. Colonel Fraser, the superintendent of the department, said such operations would thenceforward be conducted elsewhere. The jury returned a verdict that the explosion was accidentally caused by <he fnction of the drift, and added that sufficient care was not adopted in the manipu-"], [465, "EXPLOSIONS. 753 lation of gun-cotton, and that the practice of carrying on such operations in a building containing more than one hundred persons was highly reprehensible. The Great Explosion of War Rockets. \u2014 A day ever to be remembered as one of the most remarkable in the experience of Wool wich and Plumstead is Monday, tbe 24th of September, 1883. It was a day of deadly peril, of marvellous preservation ; of fearful terror, and of hairbreadth escapes. For the space of an hour a hail of war rockets descended upon tbe houses of the inhabitants and swept over the district in all directions ; yet, wonderful to say, beyond the two poor creatures who alone knew the cause of the outburst, no living soul was hurt. A \"Witness. \u2014 As an eyewitness of the event it was my task to record at the time that which I saw, and the following account was written while the impression was fresh. It was 10 a.m., or, perhaps, three minutes after the hour, as I passed the Marsh gate within a stone's throw of the principal cartridge factory on the outskirts of the Royal Arsenal. I was startled by a hissing and whistling sound, which could only have arisen from the flight of a large rocket, and, looking up, I saw the missile whirling on high, leaving its path below marked by a coil of white smoke. Instinc tively the eyes of all beholders were turned towards the rocket factories, a series of long and strongly-built brick sheds or workshops, extending by the side of the canal down the practice range towards the proof butts, and from one of these, almost the most distant, a cloud was seen to rise, while at almost the same moment a dull report, as of a slight explosion half smothered, reached the ear. Universal excitement instantly prevailed, for everybody who knew the Arsenal knew also that a burst never takes place in any of these hazardous works without consequences dire and threatening. Policemen ran to their telegraph stations and sounded the alarm, and the workpeople, throwing away their tools, hurried to the spot to help. Running down the canal bank past a number of the cartridge and rocket factories, with the men and boys at the doors, dazed and frightened and uncertain what to do, we saw the flames burst through the roof of Factory No. 16, and the workpeople were bring ing up a fire-engine along the raised wooden platform which runs from shed to shed all through the congeries of workshops. We could see that the building on fire was the one used for painting, stencilling, and packing the rockets, in which building two or three men only were employed except in busy times, and that lying broadside to it was another similar factory, used chiefly as an armoury and workshop by the men employed on the rifle range. Simultaneously with the flight of the rocket we had seen in the air, several others which had been lying on the work-bench had, it transpired, gone off point-blank, and as two men who were known to have been employed in the painting process were missing, it was at once concluded that they were past hope. The persons in the adjacent armoury, barely forty yards distant, had a narrow escape, for several of- the rockets struck that building, and almost the first one went through a window at which the foreman, Mr. Buchanan, was sitting at his desk, passed within a few inches of his head, and flew out straight through the opposite window. The inmates of this armoury, at the risk of their lives, took out with them all the explosive material there deposited and threw it into a ditch out of harm's way. As many of the live rockets afterwards entered this place, its destruction and the further spread of the mischief were doubtless arrested by these prompt precautions."], [466, "754 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. At first the extinction of the fire was the only apparent concern, and the engine was brought close to the burning building, into the doors and windows of which men and boys were throwing pails of water ; but as the fire spread new explosions occurred, rockets began to fly through the roof and walls on every side, and the men were ordered to take the engine behind the solid brickwork of the armoury, and wait till they could hope to do some good without the certain peril of their lives. The people on the bank of the canal also took flight and sought cover where they could, and for three-quarters of an hour no one but the most foolhardy would have thought of standing on the open ground anywhere within a mile of the burning factory. Every two or three seconds an explosion was heard, followed perhaps by a flight of mere signal rockets, of which no one need have any fear, but quite as frequently by the whistling overhead of a great iron Hale's rocket, sometimes at a great height, sometimes low down and close to the terrified spectators. There seemed to be hun- dreds of them going to all parts of the compass, but chiefly, I thought, into the town of Plumstead. One of the earliest I saw, well poised upon its axis, shoot along the course of the canal quite near to the water, break through some garden fences, and rebound from a paved road to the top of the Arsenal wall, whence it projected great blocks of masonry into the windows of Mr. Parker, grocer, and fell exhausted on the tramway line in Plumstead Road. Many flew across the Marshes, and some into the river. They fell like hail upon the stores and workshops of the Royal Arsenal, to the extreme danger of its thousands of artisans, and many more reached distant parts of Woolwich. This we heard from breathless arrivals as we stood in groups by the side of our chosen cover, looking on at the quickening flames and ready to hide at every warning. A sergeant of artillery, with a coolness begotten of practice, was endeavouring to convince his hearers that there was perfect security in walking about provided you watched and dodged the coming shells ; but, although he remained a living example of his doctrine, he made no converts. One of the rockets fell near where we stood. It was a 24-pounder of the usual kind ; an iron carcase with an ogival head and a twisted tail. Rockets of this kind cany no sticks to balance them, as the explosive composition in rushing out behind (the three vents being prolonged in the shape of curved shields) secures the rotation of the projectile and some degree of accuracy of flight. Not very many, however, flew straight, as they might have done if fired in the ordinary way from a tube or trough ; most of them spun over in their course, and by such as knew the proverbial eccentricity of rocket fire, even under favourable circumstances, the jeopardy in wliich they stood was not the least felt. The proximity of the gas-works, which were several times struck, was the cause of some anxiety, and the various magazines in the Marsh fields, including the cannon cartridge factory, only half a mile away, were sources of considerable anxiety to the officers of the Laboratory Department but it was afterwards learned that to these scarcely any damage was done. Super intendent Hindes and Inspector Keevil were seen to arrive early with a large body of police, and they w-ent forward with extreme caution. In all directions the sight of men throwing themselves upon their faces to escape from threatened peril was at intervals to be seen, and the police creeping along under the shadow of the plat forms towards the point of danger were really brave men, carrying their lives in their hands. Several times the building described as the armoury was on fire, and each time it was extinguished by a daring effort, and more than one man had his hair and whiskers burnt by the fierce fire of the passing rockets. A greater wreck than this armoury presented to the view when the fire abated it is impossible to conceive short of its utter destruction. Rows of rifles standing in their racks had been cut in twain, and the whole contents of the place had been heaped up in pic turesque confusion. The fire in the other factory had burnt itself out by eleven o'clock, and then the bodies of the two unhappy victims were discovered, the one"], [467, "EXPLOSIONS. 755 inside the building, and the other midway between that and the armoury, whither he had doubtless been blown by the first explosion. Both must have been instan taneously killed. Outside the Arsenal. \u2014 The people of Woolwich and Plumstead were mercifully preserved from the awful peril which attended tbis bombardment. The narrowest escape occurred at the Plumstead Road Board School. Several of the scholars were sitting at a desk just where the missile came through the wall, but none were hurt. Teachers and scholars were, however, greatly alarmed, and school was discontinued for the day. A second rocket fell on an outbuilding in the school-yard. A spectator at North Woolwich saw a rocket, weighing about 28 pounds, 18 inches in length, come across the river and bury itself about three feet in the ground a short distance from here. On looking towards the river he saw numerous other rockets, probably about twenty, which were thrown a great height and then fell into the river. One rocket buried itself in the gardens of the North Woolwich Hotel, and another penetrated the wall of No. 6, Elizabeth Street. One reached the height of Artillery Place at full speed, and scored the wall of the Royal Artillery Barracks, where the scar will be seen for many a day ; one went through two or three walls into the counting-house and shop of Mr. Paine, draper, High Street, and many were found in places remote from the scene of explosion. One was dug out of two feet of earth in the garden of Mr. Hanson, dairyman, Plumstead Common, into which it was seen to pitch after passing over St. Margaret's Church ; and another, travelling yet farther, crossed Plumstead Common, and descended in a field belonging to Mr. Jeans, at Wickham Lane. One was found on the Government ground in rear of the Royal Military Academy, and near to Shooters' Hill Police Station. It must have passed directly over the Academy buildings, and was quite two miles and a half from the rocket factories. Another broke through tbe wall of a house in Keemor Street, and numbers were seen to fall which were not recovered. False Reports. \u2014 Serious and alarming as were the facts, exag gerated reports appeared in some of the papers within a few hours of tbe explosion. One paper stated that \" ambulances were carrying out the dead and dying in the town ; \" and from all parts friends came hurrying home. The authorship of the falsehoods was not traced. The Inquest. \u2014 The inquest on the bodies of Richard Stevenson and Arthur Edward Carlick (a lad), who lost their lives in the explosion, was held at the Town Hall. Tbe Royal Laboratory Department, in which the rocket factories are situated, was represented by Col. Barlow, Royal Artillery, assistant superintendent, and Professor Sir F. A. Abel, the War Department chemist, was also present."], [468, "756 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. There was a full enquiry, but the jury were unable to determine the cause of the catastrophe, and returned an open verdict. Shoeburyness Explosion. \u2014 One of the most disastrous explosions which Woolwich has to its debit occurred, not at Woolwich, but at Shoeburyness. On the evening of Thursday, February 26th, 1885, the terrible tidings reached Woolwich that an experimental shell sent down to Shoeburyness for trial bad unaccountably burst, scattering death and destruction among a group of well-known officials both of the Royal Arsenal and the School of Gunnery who were present to witness the trial. The object of the investigation was the fuze rather than the shell. Colonel Lyon, R.A., superintendent of tbe Royal Laboratory, had invented a sensitive fuze of a very delicate character, and it was to test this in action that on the morning of the disaster he went, accom- panied by Mr. Robert Low, then assistant manager, but afterwards manager, of his department, down to the range at Shoeburyness. At half-past three in the afternoon, accompanied by the staff of the school, and the usual assistants, he went on to the Marsh to try his invention. Colonel W. A. Fox-Strangways, the commandant at Shoebury, and Captain T. W. Goold-Adams, another highly scientific officer, were present. From Woolwich, in addition to Colonel Lyon and Mr. Low, was Mr. Frederick J. Ranee, a skilled mechanic of the Laboratory Department, selected for his special knowledge and experience, and the remainder of the party were non-commissioned officers and gunners of the Royal Artillery. The fuze was screwed into the shell (one of tbe 9-inch pattern, weighing nearly four hundred lbs.), and everybody stood about, not dreaming of danger, when the shell burst. Gunner Allen was killed on the spot; Colonel Fox-Strangways had both feet shattered and died before next morning ; Colonel Lyon had both legs blown away at the thigh and succumbed at 8 a.m. on the following day; Captain Goold-Adams, who also lost both legs and was terribly mutilated about tbe face, and Sergeant-Major Dawkin, who had one leg destroyed, both died within a few hours of tbe explosion ; Mr. Ranee was severely wounded in the groin, and, though there was at first some hope for him, he ultimately died on March the 6th ; and Gunner Underwood, who had one leg carried away, made the seventh life sacrificed in this terrible disaster. Mr. Low was seriously injured in the foot, but his life was providentially saved, and the coroner's jury assembled at his bedside on the 6th of March to take his evidence. He said :\u2014 I live at Powis Lodge, Plumstead, and am assistant manager of the Royal Laboratory On February 26th, I was at Shoeburyness with Colonel Lyon and Mr. Ranee, one of our artificers. I came to run a rocket-float torpedo. After that was done Colonel Lyon took me to the battery to see his fuze fired. It was the duty of Ranee to fuze the shell, but he could not get it in. He went to the workshop for a drift to get some"], [469, "757 EXPLOSIONS. loose powder out of the way, and while he was gone I turned the shell on its nose, pushed the pellets of powder away with my finger and screwed the fuze home. Captain Goold-Adams then gave orders to place a lead disc over the fuze at the base of the shell. Sergeant-Major Dawkin tapped it, very lightly indeed . We were all close to it. Similar shells had been fired that morning with these fuzes attached when I was not present. I have a diagram of the fuze. There are three rows of little balls in grooves, three of which run upwards, three downwards, and three in a horizontal direction. They hold the pellet in position. The idea is that if you turn the shell on its nose, while three run out another three run in, and tliis applies tij every direction in which you hold the shell, as the balls are to secure the pellet from falling, no matter what its position. It was considered an absolutely safe fuze. But when the shell is fired and a rotary motion set up, the centrifugal force should send the whole of the balls outward and release the pellet, which, when the shell strikes, flies forward and fires the charge. The witness explained by the diagram that he thought the rotation of the fuze in screwing it in had thrown three of the balls out of their places, and that the tapping had caused the others to jump and slip out of their places until the pellet got free, fell forward and fired the charge, which consisted of nine pounds of powder. The shell exploded as it was being tapped. After hearing other evidence, the jury returned a verdict of \" Accidental Death.\" All the victims were buried with military honours, and their families were compensated as though they had died in action. Mr. Low returned home on the day of the inquest, March 6th, and was for a long while more or less disabled. He returned, however, to his duty until April, 18S8, when, being dissatisfied with his treatment by the Government, he resigned his post without pension, and was appointed manager of a private establishment."], [470, "CHAPTER LVIII. THAMES DISASTERS. The Greatest Affliction of the Age. \u2014 No calamity which has afflicted the generation to which we belong can compare with the loss of the \" Princess Alice \" pleasure steamboat, and the six hundred lives sacrificed at the close of a summer-like day in the autumn of 1878. The fearful suddenness of the catastrophe and the social condition of many of the victims, the awful proportions of the death-roll, and the new peril which seemed to come home to all the thousands who were wont to travel by water \u2014 all contributed to the horror of an event which shook Great Britain like an earthquake, and sent a shudder vibrating through the world. When the Furies planned this dire misfortune why should they have laid the scene at Woolwich ? Were we not sufficiently notorious for deeds of evil \u2014 murders, explosions, fires, floods, fogs, wrecks, and riots, not to speak of a reputation founded and established on the fiendish trade of war ? Most of our visitations we could have accepted as natural consequences of a risky profession and unholy commerce, but there was nothing in the nature of Woolwich any more than in any other part of the river Thames, and no special predominance even in sin over many other large towns, to justify the sorrow and stain cast upon it by the most overwhelming calamity the nation has seen in all the years which we call our time. Looking back through the seasons that have since passed we recall rebellious murmurs such as these, amid the toil and suffering of that great trial, and there seems still a strange fatality about it which we can only set down to the unsatisfactory explanation, which has often had to answer for a better reason, that \" AVoolwich is always remarkable for remarkable things.\" The < ' Princess Alice \" Sunk.\u2014 Tuesday, the 3rd day of September, 1878, had been sultry, and the evening was warm and \" muggy.\" Weary with a troublesome day's work I was preparing for an early rest when a message came that there had been a collision on the river, and that a big steamer had gone down with an untold freight of precious lives. Casting off fatigue with my slippers, I made all haste to reach Ross's Pier, enquiring of such acquaintances as I chanced to meet, a sew of"], [471, "( \u2022ollision between the \" Bywell t astir \" and the \" Princess Alice,\" Sept. 3, 1878.

On the wharf and pier a small crowd had collected, not more than fifty as yet, and among them were several well-known townsmen who, from that moment to the end of the long and heavy strain, devoted themselves day and night without pause, without thanks, and without reward, to do all that was in the power of humanity, if not to lessen the evil, at least to fulfil its sacred obligations, to bear a share of its burdens, and to bring lasting honour and renown for its humanity and public spirit upon the town of Woolwich. Ghastly Sights. \u2014 Soon policemen and watermen were seen by the feeble light bearing ghastly objects into the offices of the Steampacket Company, for a boat bad just arrived with the first consignment of the dead, mostly little children whose light bodies and ample drapery had kept them afloat even while they were smothered in the festering Thames. I followed into the steamboat office, marvelling at the fate which had brought the earliest harvest of victims to the headquarters of the doomed ship, and, entering the board-room, the first of the martyrs was pointed out to me as one of the company's own servants, a man employed on the \"Princess Alice,\" and brought here thus soon to attest by his silent presence the ship's identity. The lifeless frames of men and women lay about, and out on the balcony, from which the directors had so often looked upon their fleet through the fragrant smoke of the evening cigar, there was a sight to wring out tears of blood from the eyes of any beholder. A row of little innocents, plump and pretty, well-dressed children, all dead and cold, some with life's ruddy tinge still in their cheeks and lips, the lips from which the merry prattle had gone for ever. Lovely in death the beauteous ruins lay ; Far lovelier ! Pity swells the tide of love. Callous as one may grow from frequent contact with terrors and afflic tions, one could never be inured to this. It was a spectacle to move the most hardened official and dwell for ever in his dreams. Then to think what was beyond out there in tbe river. It was madness ! On horror's head horrors accumulate. But somebody must collect the facts together and tell the affrighted universe the desolation. Tbe task was mine. Telling the Dread News. \u2014 It was near midnight when I reached the post office with my budget of adversity. I had previously warned the telegraph clerks, as agents of the press are privileged to do, and"], [474, "760 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. they were ready. The following is the story (somewhat shortened) which at morning light was told in more than three thousand news papers, to the people of every civilized land throughout the earth : \u2014 APPALLING CATASTROPHE ON THE THAMES. LOSS OF MORE THAN 500 LIVES. (by telegraph.) (From our oicn Correspondent.) Woolwich, Tuesday, Midnight .' One of the most fearful disasters of modern times occurred this evening on the river Thames at Woolwich. The Princess Alice, one of the largest saloon steamers of the London Steamboat Company, with six or seven hundred souls on board, left London about ten o'clock this morning for Gravesend and Sheerness, the fine weather tempting aboard many excursionists for their holiday trip. She left Gravesend on the return journey soon after six o'clock in the evening, and arrived within sight of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, about eight, when a large screw steamer, said to be named the Byivell Castle, was seen approaching on the opposite course. The two steamers were near the middle of the stream just off the well-known City of London Gasworks at Beckton, and just below North Woolwich Gardens, almost the precise spot, in fact, where a fearful collision took place some ten years ago. What happened it is impossible accurately to detail. All that is known amid the maddening excite ment is that the screw steamer struck the Princess Alice on the port side near the sponson, and a scene which has no parallel on the river ensued. A few, very few, clambered on the other vessel ; nearly all rushed to the after part of the steamer as the bow subsided gradually under water. The shrieks were fearful, and nothing could be done to save life. There were a dozen or more lifebuoys on board, and some boats were swinging in the davits ; but, even if they could be got at, what were they amongst so many * The Princess Alice sank deeper and deeper, and within five minutes of the fatal blow she heeled completely over and sank in deep water. Some small boats which happened to be near hastened to the dreadful scene ; and the Duke of Teck, another steamer belonging to the same company, wliich was also on her passage up with a party of excursionists, made haste to the rescue ; but the river for a hundred yards was full of drowning people, screaming in anguish and praying for help. The only coherent account your Correspondent was able to obtain came from a passenger on board the Duke of Teck \u2014 Mr. Warren Hawkes, landlord of the Steam Packet, Woolwich, who, assisted by Mr. Plaisted, also of Woolwich, saved several of the passengers. Some half-dozen women, wrapped in blankets, before the fire in the Steam Packet kitchen, and about a dozen, who are supposed to have gone to their homes by rail, composed the full roll of survivors that I am able to account for ; but the dead are being brought in \u2014 men, women, and little children. The board-room of the Steamboat Company, on Ross's Wharf, is turned into a temporary mortuary, and the gas is lighted in the Town Hall to receive more of the ghastly tenants if need be. But even of the recovered dead there are not many \u2014 a score or so, all told. The floor of the scanty board-room is almost covered with the bodies as they lay wherever they are put down, for shells and stretchers are bringing them up from the Duke of Teck and the small boats. All the police of the town and the arsenal are helping in the work, laying the corpses in order, putting labels on their breasts, and doing all the little that there is to be done when all are impatient to do much. Outside the board-room window is a balcony, upon which lie, as in repose, the bodies of three or four little children \u2014 mere babies. The majority of the"], [475, "PLATE LXXIII. The Crowd at the Steamboat Offices, Ross Pier. [To face page 760.]"], [476, ""], [477, "THAMES DISASTERS. 761 dead are women. A body has been identified, that of Joseph Freeman, the steward, who has been with the company all his life. The engineer was saved, but the captain, William Grinstead, and all or nearly all the remainder of his crew, are amongst the lost\u2014 in the dark river. Mr. Towse, the superintendent of the company's fleet, was on board with his wife and five or six children, but he went on shore at Gravesend. The body of his wife is one of those brought lifeless to Woolwich, and there is too much cause to fear that all the children are drowned, though a rumour prevails that one has been saved. Amongst the others supposed to be lost are Mr. John Hawkes (brother of the Mr. Hawkes aforesaid) and his wife, who were both on board the Princess Alice, and have not appeared. The officials at the Plumstead Workhouse made prompt preparation to render any help in their power, and half naked survivors were about midnight taken in cabs to the infirmary. Doctors, police, parish officials, and others rendered aid, and the whole population of Woolwich seem congregated in the streets about the water-side eager to hear a scrap of news or gain a shade of comfort over the addition of one more to the list of saved. At North Wool wich Gardens, where the usual gay scene was in progress, the news fell like a black pall. Mr. Holland at once stopped the music and dancing, and the grounds were very rapidly cleared. A Lodge of Freemasons at the Henley Arms at once adjourned, and the most intense feeling of sorrow, sympathy, and excitement prevails on all sides. 12.30. \u2014 I have just learned that about twenty-five passengers were landed on the north side of the river near the Beckton Gasworks, and a few may have been picked up and carried on to London or Erith. I am afraid that, making all allowances, the loss of life must be set down at fully five hundred souls. The following is the statement of the second steward : \u2014 My name is William Alexander Law, living at 37, Wansey Street, Walworth Road. I was second steward on board the Princess Alice. We left Gravesend at about six o'clock. At the time of the collision I was in the saloon and there were about fifteen people there. The time I should say was about a quarter to eight p.m., when I heard a crash. It was not very heavy the first time, and I said to the stewardess, \" There's some barge along side,\" when immediately there was another crash. I ran upon deck, and, amid the confusion and screams of the passengers, I heard the water rushing in below, and saw that we were sinking. I then rushed to the top of the saloon gangway and shouted, \"Come on deck, we are sinking.\" The scene on board I shall never forget. I ran to a young lady with whom I was keeping company, and took her on my shoulder, being a good swimmer, and jumped overboard, and swam to the shore, but as I was going my poor girl slipped off my shoulders, or was dragged off, and I lost her, although I dived for her. I saw a gentleman (Mr. Talbot, of Forest Hill), who was sinking, and caught hold of him and held him till we were picked up. In answer to inquiries Mr. Law said that the steamer that run them down went on. He saw hundreds in the water drowning, but could not help them. He thinks there were about seven hundred on board. One young woman, now at the work house, says that her baby was washed out of her arms, and that she has lost her husband and three little ones. One man reached the north shore with a life-buoy round him. He states that he jumped overboard, after telling his wife to throw their children and jump after him, but he lost them all. At the Beckton Gasworks Mr. Trueby and Mr. Bush, the manager and assistant-manager, provided warm clothing and nourishment for the survivors, and, like the helpers in the town of Woolwich, did all that in them lay to restore animation to the lifeless bodies, all of whom had been too long immersed to give hope of restoration. Some of the living were, however, in such a prostrate condition that but for the help they received they, too, must have been added to the long list of dead. The vessel which ran into the Princess Alice was a screw collier going to the north,"], [478, "762 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. light in ballast, and she was in charge of a pilot named Dicks. Captain Grinstead was not seen after the accident, but he was observed at his post shortly before the collision. A large proportion of the passengers were on the upper or saloon deck, and must have seen beforehand their impending doom ; but those in the stem of the vessel had no warning until they heard the crash, and found the fore passengers running aft. Beyond the fact that the tide was about two hours ebb, which would enable the Princess Alice to ease and stop sooner than the screw, which would be borne on the tide, it is impossible to discover any of the circumstances immediately preceding the collision. Before the boats struck there were cries from one to the other to keep out of the way ; but as usual in such cases the accident is probably due to a misunderstanding, the one misinterpreting the intentions of the other. All the rules of sailing are cast to the winds in the moment of peril, each taking the wrong course to avoid each other's blunder, and, like the meeting of two embarrassed pedestrians on the footpath, rushing into each other's bosom. The Newspapers. \u2014 The foregoing statement represents the first impressions derived from such hasty and excited narratives as a reporter could gather among the wailing and turmoil, and it is to the credit of my informants that there was very little written down which I have since wished to amend. Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office ; and his tongue .Sounds ever after as a sullen bell Remembered knolling a departed friend. Tbe loss of life was nearly six hundred instead of five hundred as conjectured, conjectured without any certain evidence of the number on board, and I was told that the Alice was struck on the starboard, not the port side, but there was little else to correct, little else to reveal. The gloom and misery and despair of the next day and the days which followed, who can describe ? The newspapers of course were full of minute details on every possible phase of the frightful theme. Some of the editors had been telegraphing to me all through the wretched night to \"keep on wiring,\" and the first train down in the morning brought an army of reporters. One \" daily\" alone had nine special correspondents at work in Woolwich for the best part of a week, so eager was the public appetite to feed upon the caviare news. Seekers for the Dead. \u2014 Crowds of others beside tbe pressmen also flocked hither, mostly mere curiosity-seekers, but among them anxious and agonized friends vainly seeking those whom they had lost. It was more dreadful to see these survivors than to look upon the dead. In the next fortnight we were familiar with the sight of strangers, generally in couples, walking with dazed and melancholy aspect through streets, waiting for their dead to be brought on shore; and every7 day we saw the same sad faces as they passed down the dread array of corpses in tbe Dockyard, looked for the loved ones, who would see them never more on earth."], [479, "PLATE LXXIV. At the Town Hall, [To face page 762.]"], [480, ""], [481, "THAMES DISASTERS. 763 The Funerals. \u2014 It was fortunate that there was a large place like tbe Dockyard available to meet the emergency, and the authorities not only granted its use, but sent down large parties of soldiers to render help. As soon as a body was identified it was coffined and promptly buried, and long processions of army waggons bearing tbe dead to the cemetery were seen day after day. One of tbe latest of tbe bodies re- The Inquest. covered was that of Mr. Frederick Whomes, the talented organist of the Dockyard Church, who, being a well-known Woolwich man, was followed to the grave by thousands of the townspeople. The Inquest. \u2014 The inquest was held in tbe Board room at the Town Jlall, before Mr. C. J. Carttar, coroner, and occupied more than thirty"], [482, "764 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. days. The identification evidence alone took up much time, and was of a very melancholy character. Most of tbe witnesses were persons well-to-do in life, and many of them told one after another of whole families lost, with bere and there a husband and father left mourning alone, his household robbed of all the rest \u2014 All, all the pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop. The testimony as to the accident was as conflicting as such testimony usually is, but every one who was thought capable of shedding a ray of light upon the case was called before the jury. Diverse Verdicts. \u2014 At the end Mr. C. J. Carttar made a long and lucid summing up, and the magnitude of the disaster affected even the deliberations of the jury, who sat from seven at night until five in the morning before they could agree upon a verdict. I have a sheet of foolscap on which the scribe of the jury drafted a dozen or more verdicts before his terms could satisfy even a majority, but it concludes with the decision which fifteen out of the nineteen jurors consented at last to sign, and tbis was a verdict against the Princess Alice. However, another jury at Millwall bad also gone into the facts and found that tbe blame was due to the Bywell Castle, and, sour days prior to the Woolwich verdict, a legal opinion had been given in tbe Admiralty Court against both the Princess Alice and the Bywell Castle, so that the net result was of very questionable value. The Number of Dead. \u2014 The Princess Alice Memorial in Woolwich cemetery was erected by a sixpenny subscription throughout tbe king dom. The inscription states with sufficient accuracy that tbe victims numbered 5-50. As nearly as I have been able to ascertain, and I have endeavoured to make tbis record precise, there were 544 inquests at Woolwich, and 46 elsewhere, making the total 590. Some of the dead may have been washed out to sea and never recovered, but this is not probable. Woolwich spent \u00a31,380 in recovering and burying the dead, and tbe county justices, who had always previously paid such expenses, repudiated the charge and escaped by a quibble.* The Treasury voted \u00a3100 towards the bill, and the ratepayers paid tbe rest. Memorial Cross. \u2014 The memorial just mentioned consists of a handsome ornamental marble cross of the Irish order, and the base has an inscription which says : \u2014 \" It was computed that seven hundred men, women, and children were on board. Of these about five hundred and fifty were drowned. One hundred and twenty were buried near this place.\" * A special Act of Parliament has since been passed rendering the county liable for expenses incurred in recovering drowned bodies."], [483, "PLATE LXXV. Scene ofthe Wreck ofthe \"Princess Alice (from the North). [To face page 764]"], [484, ""], [485, "THAMES DISASTERS. 765 On another face of the pedestal it is stated that the memorial was\u2014 \" Erected by a national sixpenny subscription, to which more than twenty-three thousand persons contributed.\" The Graves. \u2014 The subscription was organized and conducted by the Eector of Woolwich, tbe Hon. and Rev. A. Anson, afterwards Bishop. The graves of the victims lie in four rows to the north of the memorial cross, and have diminutive head-stones. Many of these when first set up were without names, those of the deceased not recognized being indicated by some word and number, such as \"Barking, 7,\" or \"Erith, 12,\" a similar record being kept with their clothing; but all except a dozen or so were ultimately identified. Captain Grinstead.\u2014 Quite adjacent is the grave of the captain of the Princess Alice, and his relatives who were drowned on the same fatal occasion : \u2014 William R. H. Grinstead, aged 47 ; John J. Grinstead, 14 ; Charles T. Grinstead, 56 ; and Jane Grinstead, 53. Terrible Tale of a Fog. \u2014 Until the wreck of the Princess Alice, one of the saddest of our river disasters dates from the winter of 1873-4 \u2014 a gloomy winter indeed for AVoolwich. All the winters about that time were trying to those whose business led them on the river, on account of the frequency and density of the fogs which prevailed, and the need of sufficient facilities for counteracting their obstructive malevolence. Hundreds of workmen had to cross from South to North Woolwich in the early morning to reach their work, but when the heavy mists obscured everything the steamers were unable to run, and then the watermen made harvest, hazarding their own lives, and jeopardising the lives of all who ventured in their frail wherries upon the Stygian stream. The fare was 2d., and each boat was licensed to carry eight persons, making the poor recompense of ls. 4d. for tbe daring journey. It was, however, notorious that the boats were often over loaded, but nobody seems to have thought of danger, the only anxiety felt in regard to the venture being as to the good or bad luck which the boat might have in reaching the opposite shore, for it was a frequent experience to find, after rowing about in the dark for half-an hour, that the boat came back to the spot from whence it started. Some of the boats carried compasses, but tbe utility of the compass depends to some extent on knowing how to read it, and also on being able to see it, conditions which were not always present on these occasions. 3c"], [486, "766 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. At five o'clock on the morning of Saturday, October 25th, a pitchy darkness hung about the Thames, and the usual crowd of from five hundred to a thousand people who had left their beds to seek their scenes of toil, sound themselves practically cut off from their labour. Most of them wisely returned home, preferring to lose part of a day's earnings than to risk their lives in tbe voyage of a small boat. But some, more reluctant to sacrifice their family bread, resolved to brave the consequences. Isaac Charles Digby was one of the watermen engaged in the fearful work, and was known to be an experienced and a careful man. But, somehow or other, more than the legal comple ment of eight passengers crowded into his little craft. Probably he could not count them accurately in the fog, and there is no reason to suppose that the boat was seriously overloaded. There seems to have been ten passengers and the waterman on board, but no one certainly made any remark or objection on this score. At a quarter-past five, Digby and his party rowed off from Bell Water Gate. He had a compass of large size, being ten inches in diameter, and it was tied by a piece of yarn to the thwart in front of him as he pulled the stroke oar, the bow being taken by one of the passengers, presumably a young fellow named Lanna. Who the others were nobody knew. It was a spring tide, about quarter ebb, and running down full speed. To allow for the set of the stream, Digby took his boat up alongshore nearly to the Dockyard, and then struck out, hoping to \"fetch\" the causeway' on tbe north bank, steering by aid of the compass, occasionally illumined by a fickle match. There were several vessels belonging to tbe Steamboat Company at their usual moorings near the Dockyard ; the wherry was supposed to have gone clear of these, and, as the compass showed at every inspection that they were steering due north, it was thought at length that they were near their landing and the danger past. Then they saw close to them the light of a vessel at anchor, and one exclaimed \u2014 ' ' All right ! thank God, we are safe ; it is the ferry-boat at NortL Woolwich Pier ! \" But the tide was running as fiercely as the sluice of a mill-stream, and bore the boat towards the bows of the vessel, the hull of which became more visible, and, being white, was at once discovered to be the saloon-ship Princess Alice (Ugh ! the Princess Alice!), lying at her moorings. The boat, therefore, instead of having crossed the river as supposed, was still near the south shore, amid the dangerous moorings of the steamers, into which it had been swept by the torrent. Tbe resistless tide had complete mastery, and the boat was instantly cast into the vortex of a whirlpool. Perhaps some of the affrighted fellows rose from their seats and precipitated their fate. Perhaps it was of little consequence whether they did so or not. The wherry went"], [487, "THAMES DISASTERS. 767 under in the dreadful gurge, and all its passengers were left struggling in the rapids. Digby could swim, and managed to reach the paddle\u00b0 wheel of the Princess Alice, but only one other was spared to tell the tale, a young man named John Wright, who chanced to touch the up turned boat, and hung on to the keel. A Dreadful Day. \u2014 A day of awful anxiety and suspense was that. Nobody could tell who or how many were drowned, and as the news flew round, wives and mothers and children felt a fearful dread. The Victims. \u2014 When the hour came at which the workpeople should return, nine were missing. One of these was a well-known, worthy, and useful man, Thomas Smith, aged 50, a storekeeper at the Silvertown Indiarubber Works, and an official at Rectory Place Congregational Church. The others were George Gray, 64 ; Patrick Martin, 45 ; Henry Tanner, 25 ; Joseph Jocelyn, 65 ; Samuel Jones, 26; William Piper, 39; Patrick Lanna, 16; and John Taylor, 15. These nine were all sacrificed to the Demon Fog. Wasted Research. \u2014 The bodies were not recovered for several weeks, and the first turned up at Poplar, where a hasty and unsatis factory inquest was held, and resulted in a vague and uncertain verdict. From frequent delays, two months elapsed before any real inquiry took place on the spot, and the calamity had become an old story. The lessons of the accident, and the leverage which it might have given to such projects as a subway or steam ferry, were thus to some extent lost, and the jury contented themselves with a simple ordinary verdict of \" Accidental Death.\" Public Generosity. \u2014 A public subscription was, however, started by the Local Board of Health as soon as the accident was known, and the public, deeply sympathising, quickly raised a fund of \u00a3777, which was divided among the bereaved families according to their needs. Mr. C. Jolly wrote a poem on the sad subject, and six thousand copies were sold on behalf of the fund. The Training Ships. \u2014 Two winters later and we had the burn ing of the training ships.

This carried me only to Dartford, where I could learn nothing except that the ship on fire was a training vessel, and, knowing that there were three or four of these lower down, I made use of the few hours which were usually wasted at Dartford station to walk over to Greenhithe. There I met an officer of the well-known Arethusa or Chichester, those admirable \" Rescue \" ships to which so many boys owe their better lives to-day, and picked up some of the facts of which I was in quest.

The boats of the Chichester and Arethusa had been down to help, and, baving collected all the information which I could at Greenhithe, I wanted to get across to the wreck at Grays. This desire I modestly hinted to one who has not usually hesitated to lend a hand under the pres sure of public duty, but be did not seem to think that the occasion was one demanding the risk of a boat's crew, not to speak of myself, in the face of a furious tempest, and, as the down train was just about passing for Gravesend, I thought I would go on and take the steamer across, spend an hour of investigation at Grays, and then carry my budget to town by the four-something train, after which there was no other until eight or nine. But Gravesend revealed the mortifying fact that there would be no steamer across until just before four ; the one, in fact, which took passengers to my train, and it was now but 2 p.m. What was to be done ? Three times the legal fare I offered tbe watermen to put me just on the other side, that I might walk up the bank to the ship, but they coolly intimated that I should have to multiply by twenty before I got them to drown themselves ; and there was no help for it but to spend the time in scraping up such thin materials as Gravesend could Artillery, 1870.

But, sorrowful as it is to confess the fact, I never reached the Goliath. Had I alighted from the train at Grays I must have trusted to the doubtful talents of the rural telegraph-office, totally inexperienced in press- work, and possibly obstructive on tbe question of tariff, or I must have waited till late for the next train, which would have been a wrong done to the papers and the public, who expect early news. So, concluding that some people from the ship must be going up to town by the same train, I resolved to go with it; and, taking particular observation of the people who came \"on board\" at Grays, I was enabled, by changing from carriage to carriage at tbe stopping stations, to get a fairly accurate and comprehensive account by tbe time we stopped at Stratford, where I found the help of experienced telegraphists in sending off my first despatch, followed by fuller details later on, with many stirring illustrations of perils, escapes and heroism. All this has been set down here partly because it is preliminary to the story of the Warspite, and partly to show the straits to which misfortunes and emergencies may reduce even the most faithful and truthful of correspondents ; and, although I have always felt that the exigency of tbe moment justified me in turning my back upon the Goliath, without one look at that which I had spent the day in going to see, there is just a sense of relief in having made a clean breast. The \"Warspite.\" \u2014 The burning of the Warspite brought some sort of penance, for I was knocked up out of my first sleep between one and two in the morning, and had the detestable task of leaving a warm bed, and facing, half dead with sleep, the horrors of the winter midnight. It was Monday the 3rd of January, 1876, pitch dark and pinching cold. When I reached Charlton Pier, I could make out the fine old training-ship at her old moorings, and, except for a puff of smoke forward, looking just like ber ancient self. A police-boat put me on board, and I ascended the companion ladder so often trod at festive times by royal feet. Reaching the deck and descending to the state room, I found the well-known commander, Captain Phipps, in conference with Mr. Sadler, the secretary of the Marine Society, and Mr. A. Castles, of the adjacent ship-breaking yard. The Ship on Fire.\u2014\" Thank God, the boys are safe,\" was the captain's first salute, and then I learnt that the fire had broken out in the fore-cockpit, used as a store-room, that the two hundred lads had quietly risen from their hammocks, worked at the pumps till half suffocated with smoke, then marched in order and silence to tbe boats alongside,"], [493, "771 THAMES DISASTERS. and rowed ashore. Some were there provided for in the premises belonging to the ship on the bank, but the majority were taken to the workhouse at Plumstead in vans and cabs.

If I could get only one hose to play on the under side of the orlop deck, I believe I could stop it, but it is quite impossible. We must pump in all we can and try to drown the fire out ; if that don't answer we must scuttle her.\" \" How long before you do that ? \" \"Some hours, I expect. We can keep the fire down if we can't put it out.\" \" Would it not be better to scuttle her at once and save all you can\"!\" I asked. \" No, that is the last extremity. We must not give it up because it is a hard job. I'm afraid we shall not save much any way, but never mind that. Thank Heaven the boys are all safe ! They can get another ship.'' The Pent-up Fire. \u2014 Still no fire to be seen, and the firemen as they descended the ladders disappeared in the darkness as of a coal mine. But occasional reports came to tbe captain, as he was coolly collecting his papers in the saloon, that tbe fire was gradually working aft, and we knew that all the splashing of water which we heard under our feet could not long delay the flames from bursting through. Tbis went on until nearly five o'clock, and I was walking about the deck waiting for the dawn, wondering when the volcano would belch forth, when I heard with some relief the voice of Captain Hamlin. \" Off with the lights from the stern-hatch ! \" \" You know your duty of course,\" said the courteous secretary, \" but it is quite contrary to naval usage to open a hatchway to give vent to a fire.\" \" I am well aware of it, sir,\" said the superintendent, \" but my men down there cannot breathe, and I must either give them air, or call them away.\" Down the Hold. \u2014 Off came the covers from tbe hatchway, and we peered down. A little smoke cleared away and we could see right through tbe three decks to the hold of the ship. There was a bright glare, but still no flame. Down there at the bottom was a large model of the doomed ship, used to school the boys in rigging and nautical nomenclature, and there it stood unscathed for hours afterwards, even in the midst of the raging holocaust. Tbe firemen were on the main deck, just below us, pumping streams of water into tbe hold, hoping to swamp the fire out where it bid, and beating it back whenever a tongue of flame attempted to lick the edge of the hatchway. But the effect of the ventilation was soon seen in the increasing glare of the reflection beiow, and by-and-by sparks began to fly about, and the firemen, no longer safe upon their perch a dozen feet above the burning deck, were summoned to \" give over.\" Then every one was mustered on the upper deck. \" She is done for,\" was the verdict of the firemen as they passed over the side \" Scuttle the ship ! \""], [495, "THAMES DISASTERS. 773 cried the captain, just as he would in happier times have given the order to \" pipe for breakfast.\" Men were waiting in boats alongside with adzes and augers, but it is no simple matter to cut through the 12 or 14 inch planks of an old man-of-war ; and, what with the ebbing tide and the heavy ballast of water in her, the ship was soon aground and careened slightly over to tbe port side, away from shore. Abandoned. \u2014 The tide fell away, and before it rose again the ship had scuttled herself, for the fire, once free to roam, soon spread itself The \" Warspite \" Hammocks. along the decks and burst out at the stern through the state-room windows. By 10 o'clock the vessel was a mass of flames, and those of the multitude who rowed round her, and looked into the Inferno from its stern gate, experienced one of the grandest spectacles which have ever greeted my eyes. The Finish. \u2014 Soon after twelve the mizen-mast fell with a crash over the port side, and an hour later the main and fore masts followed suit. At three o'clock only the charred ribs of the good ship Warspite"], [496, "774 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. were left, and the rising tide had very little of the fire left to extinguish. The Cause. As to the origin of the fire there were unpleasant rumours from the first. The gallantry of the Goliath boys had been resounding through the land, and what so likely as that the Warspite boys should long for the like fame ? The idea of incendiarism was scouted from beginning to end by the officers of the ship, but the In the \" Warspite\" School-room. The young Princes signing the Register.

Accordingly a group of the quill-men waited all day"], [497, "775 THAMES DISASTERS. in the ante-room, and some surprise was expressed at seeing me alone busy while all the rest were idle. But they did not know that I had a friend in the street, who met tbe witnesses one by one as they came out and collected from them the nature of the evidence which they had just given before my Lord Mayor and the court inside. It was not a creditable artifice, I know, but neither was it justifiable of the court to investigate a matter of public importance with closed doors. If I did wrong, I did it for the sake of the public, and it is a long while ago. The column of evidence which appeared next day somewhat astonished the court and puzzled my colleagues. It was naturally set down to the treachery of someone on the Board, but the immediate effect was to throw open the enquiry, and the reporters were all admitted. Nothing Traced. \u2014 In the course of the evidence several lads were called who said that they saw two boys come up from the cockpit just before the fire broke out and run along the deck, but they either could not or would not identify them, and the story was not considered proved. In fact, nothing at all was proved, and the burning of the Warspite remains a mystery to this day. The sketches which illustrate this narrative were made on the occa sion of the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales and the Princes Victor and George to the new Warspite on June 21st, 1877."], [498, "CHAPTER LIX. MISHAPS AND TRAGEDIES. An Icy Grave. \u2014 A great impression was produced in the winter of 1831 by an accident on tbe ice, which has a tombstone record in Woolwich Churchyard, close by the public footpath, that all who run may read. Tbe following is from a newspaper of the period : \u2014 February 6th, 1831. On Sunday last a number of children, belonging to soldiers of the Royal Artillery, were sliding on Mulgrave Pond at the back of the Artillery Barracks, which is twelve feet deep and used for the Arsenal, and while thus engaged two youths, named Bell and Moseley, in order to ascertain if the ice was of sufficient strength to bear them in skating, caused the boys to congregate upon it and threw halfpence among them to scramble, when the ice gave way and seventeen were precipitated into the water. All were with difficulty got out alive, except five. At the inquest Bell and Moseley were severely censured and seemed to suffer great remorse. A verdict of \"Accidental Death \" was returned. The tombstone in the churchyard is inscribed with several verses, of which tbe following form part : \u2014 ;' Stop, thoughtless youth ! nor heedless pass this stone ! Mark well their end ! You know not what's your own ; In early life, thus quickly caught away To meet their Maker on the Sabbath day. \" That holy morn, in blooming health they rose ; But on their bier were laid before its close ; For, scorning God's command and friend's advice, They sunk and died beneath the faithless ice.\" And on the other side ofthe stone it is stated that \u2014 \" The jurors who were present at the coroner's inquest on the melancholy occasion have caused this memorial to be erected by public contributions to commemorate the mournful event, and more especially to impress upon the young the necessity and im portance of remembering their Creator in the days of their youth, and to excite them to avoid the sin and danger of violating the Sabbath day.\" An 111- winged Bullet. \u2014 Another fatality which old Woolwichers have been fond of relating was that which befell Charlotte Rees in the month of March, 1839. The following is the reporter's account : \u2014 9th March, 1839. \u2014 The town of Woolwich was thrown into most intense excitement on Monday last in consequence of a report that a woman had been found murdered in a cottage which is situated near Powis Street. The body of the deceased was found"], [499, "MISHAPS AND TRAGEDIES. 777 by her mother, lying on the floor quite dead, weltering in her blood. Her name was Charlotte Rees, aged seventeen, the daughter of a gardener. A young soldier who was often in her company was suspected and taken into custody, but speedily released in consequence of a young man named James Woolley, one of Mr. Furlong's work men, voluntarily surrendering himself as having been the cause of the poor girl's death. At six o'clock in the evening Woolley and two others were amusing them selves in their master's yard by firing at a butcher's block as a target with a carbine, which they had taken from Mr. Furlong's warehouse without his permission ; hut Woolley fired it at too elevated a degree, and thereby occasioned the bullet to enter the boarded side of the cottage, and thence into the room where the deceased was ironing, and striking her on the back part of the head, passed through the brain and out at her forehead. An inquest was held on Tuesday, and a verdict of \" Man slaughter \" was returned. The innocent cause of the mischief was, however, not punished. The Tomb. \u2014 Charlotte Rees was buried close by the footpath which crosses the old churchyard, and a tombstone was erected over her grave, presenting on the one side a long address on the uncertainty of life, and on the other a series of verses in the following strain : \u2014 Here lies, cut off amidst her youthful bloom, Consigned to dwell in darkness and the tomb, The last remains of one who had not seen The winters and the summers of eighteen. No one was present when the fatal ball Entered by accident the cottage wall ; But in a moment she who lies below Sunk prostrate under Death's relentless blow. The Cat-o'-nine-tails. \u2014 It may perhaps be permitted to class as misadventures two or three fatalities connected with Woolwich Garrison. Of such was the death of William Saundry, a private in the Royal Marines, which occurred in 1836, and was alleged to have been brought about by the cruel punishment of a hundred lashes under sentence of court-martial. There is scarcely a doubt that Woolwich was at one time distinguished for the severity of these chastisements, and there is furthermore reason to believe that the abolition of the lash was due in a large measure to the persistent protests of its inhabitants. The case of Saundry appears indeed to have stimulated in a considerable degree tbe crusade against the flogging custom, and the final and successful attack certainly emanated from our garrison town. On the 20th February, 1836, the inquest on William Saundry was opened at the King's Tavern, near the Royal Marine Barracks. Henry Parker, military surgeon, said deceased was twenty -four years of age. He was flogged on the 8th and went into hospital on the 9th inst. He was a man of very full habit. He was put to bed and his back got nearly well, but on the 18th he complained of pain in the groin and could not sleep. He was feverish and was bled repeatedly. Symptoms of effusion on the chest and of inflammation of the nervous membrane of the bowels followed, which witness believed were the cause"], [500, "778 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. of death. He did not attribute it to the flogging. A post-mortem examination showed that he died solely from fever. A juror asked if deceased had been flogged before, and witness replied that he was sentenced to two hundred lashes in the previous September, but only one hundred and twenty were inflicted, and the man soon recovered. He was a hale and hearty man. Juror. \u2014 Is it usual for men who are flogged to have fever after ? It sometimes occurs, but it depends a good deal on the constitution. The inquiry was adjourned and caused much excitement. At the next sitting nine other medical men, who were present at the post-mortem ex.imination, attended the inquest, and several of them gave evidence in confirmation of the foregoing. Eight of the seventeen jurymen, however, expressed their strong belief that the man's death was due to the flogging, and the jury were locked up for two hours. Eventually thirteen agreed to a verdict of \" Died by the visitation of God.\" The Strange Verdict. \u2014 The case and the curious verdict led to much discussion throughout the country, and an official enquiry was held at the War Office. The cat-o'-nine-tails used in the Marines was examined and found to be shorter and stouter than the usual military pattern, and therefore more formidable. Conflicting opinions, however, prevailed as to the severity of the lash, and the Duke of Cambridge was one amongst many authorities strongly opposed to its abolition. There were repeated discussions on the subject in Parliament, and there was great diversity of feeling among all classes of the people, while in the army it was notorious that all good soldiers supported the system. Conversion was therefore slow and gradual, and it took many years to banish the cat from the barrack yard. The Shooting of Bombardier Grice. \u2014 Some of the more terrible tragedies of the Garrison must form another chapter. But there was the case of Bombardier Grice, which, whatever may be its criminal character, undoubtedly created an immense amount of excitement in its time. On Monday, June 14th, 1841, Woolwich was roused by a report that a bombardier in the Royal Artillery bad been shot dead by a gunner in the barracks. The gunner, by name James McGarity, had been drink ing at the canteen and there quarrelled with another gunner, by whom he was severely maltreated. This was at half-past seven in the evening, and McGarity then went to his barrack room in the eastern wing of tbe great arch. The Crime. \u2014 The unfortunate bombardier, whose name was John Grice, wTas standing writing at a window, when the gunner went to the place where his musket was, and, taking it down, fired it at his victim, who was taken to the Ordnance Hospital close by and died at three o'clock next morning. He had no difference whatever with his assassin and was highly respected in the corps. He was thirty-two years of age and married."], [501, "MISHAPS AND TRAGEDIES. 779 McGarity was arrested, but his officers refused for a time to give him up to the civil power, although a magistrate's warrant was issued, their excuse being that they had been told by the coroner to detain him. He was produced at the inquest by a guard of the Royal Horse Artil lery. He was about forty years of age. To Sergeant-Major Porter field, who arrested him, he said, \"I have been a good soldier till now, and now I am a murderer. I was vexed and maddened, but not by the bombardier ; he was the best friend I had in the world. I hope he will not die.\" Tbe jury found a verdict of \" Wilful murder \" against McGarity, who was committed to take his trial at Newgate on the coroner's warrant. A Good Defence.\u2014 At the trial Mr. Clarkson ably defended the prisoner, and contended that the unfortunate affair was only an accident. The judge, Lord Abinger, expressed a belief that the prisoner had loaded his gun for the purpose of shooting his assailant in the canteen, and that it had gone off by accident. If this were so, although the intention was illegal, the crime did not amount to murder. The jury returned a verdict of\" Manslaughter,\" and the prisoner was sentenced to a year's imprisonment with hard labour. A Crime in the Cambridge Barracks.\u2014 While the Wiltshire (62nd) Regiment was at Woolwich in 1882, a sad business happened, which for a time, although the town had the Plumstead poisoning case on hand, made a painful sensation, in which some sort of sympathy for the offender was mingled witb tbe natural horror of bis dreadful deed. Corporal James Edgar and Corporal Alfred Harris were friends as well as comrades, and had served together in India and in Aden, from whence they came to Woolwich. Edgar was a soldier of twenty-three years' service and was soon to have had his discharge from the army, but Harris had been only five years in the ranks, two of which he served with the 99th Regiment in India. He was usually an abstainer from strong drink, and a member of the Good Templars' Society, for strong drink was his foe, and had conquered him to his hurt more than once. For fifteen months prior to November, 1882, he had not tasted the liquor which was madness to him, but some demon tempted him, and it came to pass that on Saturday, November 4th, he was suffering all the tor tures, mental and bodily, which follow an unaccustomed debauch. Some motive, never explained, induced him to purchase a swordstick for half a-crown at the shop of Mr. Gray, tobacconist, in Green's End, and, with tbis in his hand, he returned to the barracks about 7 p.m. He began flourishing his new sword in tbe presence of his comrades, one of whom broke tbe blade in two, but Harris took away the fragments, and went roaming about in a dangerous mood. In one of the rooms he fell in with a sergeant, named McCully, and began to use violent"], [502, "780 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. language towards him. Sergeant McCully and the prisoner usually occupied the same room, and the sergeant, knowing that discipline must be enforced, called on Corporal Edgar to make Corporal Harris a prisoner. A Death-blow. \u2014 Edgar proceeded reluctantly to arrest his friend, when the light-headed idiot drew the blade of his swordstick and plunged it dagger-wise into Edgar's breast. Tbe weapon sank deep, and the death-blood from the heart and lungs of the unfortunate man sprang from the fountain of his lips. He stood for a little while speech less and then sank on his cot and died. The wicked deed was witnessed by several other soldiers, but the assassin ran out of the room, and for an hour afterwards there was a hue and cry all over the town in pur suit, but at the end of the hour he walked into his own room and was made prisoner by McCully. He used some threats towards the sergeant while he was in the guard-room and said, \"It is quite a mistake that you got off ; \" but there was no evidence of previous malice, and, though apparently sober, he was clearly in a state of frenzy, and scarcely knew bis words. He was exceedingly violent and broke two pairs of handcuffs, and when the police came to remove him he had to be carried down to the police-station strapped to a stretcher. On the way, getting calmer, he said to his custodians : \u2014 \" What is my crime \u2014 murder or attempted murder . I have done it on the drink, and I shall go to the gallows like a man. I am not afraid to meet my Maker. I have suffered and been flogged, and I can suffer again.\" The prisoner was committed for trial, was convicted at the Old Bailey of \" Wilful Murder,\" and sentenced to death, but, under consideration of all the circumstances, his sentence was commuted to one of penal servitude for life. Mark Councill' S Vengeance. \u2014 The next story is of a different complexion and owed much of its local notoriety to the local knowledge of the individuals concerned. \" Woolwich, October 5th, 1858. \" Dear Friend, \" I thank God for all his mercies, although my misfortunes have been so great, but before you get this all this will be at an end. I had hoped it would have been finished before, but the time had not come ; I hope the opportunity will occur to-night. I give you as a last remembrance my medal and three clasps. . . . Pity your murdered friend, Edward Mark Councill, who ought to be the Hon. E. H. Scott, for his grandfather was the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1798, and Earl of Clonmell. May I be permitted to take the life of my perjurer and I shall die happy.\" Before the Act. \u2014 Thus wrote an old man of sixty-three years who had been a sergeant in the Royal Sappers and Miners, and subsequently armourer in Woolwich Dockyard ; and the day after it was written"], [503, "781 MISHAPS AND TRAGEDIES. saw him in prison under peril of death for murder. His judgment was undoubtedly defective, but he was swayed by a strong will, and so far as such a man could be held responsible for his deeds, his troubles may certainly be laid only to his own charge. In October, 18-54, while holding the office of armourer, he was detected by Police-Inspector J. W. Budd in the act of leaving the Dockyard with some copper bolts in his possession, for which offence he was committed for trial and sen tenced to four months' imprisonment. In consequence he lost his appointment and his pension also, and he did nothing afterwards but brood over his sorrows. At last he determined in a blundering way to set matters right by shooting Inspector Budd, and then committing suicide. A heap of papers, addressed to the coroner, he left at his lodgings, 5, Cross Street East, on the afternoon of Wednesday, Octo ber 6th, and sallied forth on his murderous errand. In Church Street he knew that he should probably meet the inspector, and there he waited until half-past four, when Mr. Budd appeared, on his way to the Dockyard. Observing Councill, and being aware of his ill-will, be kept an eye upon him, but had to pass on in front, and could catch but a glimpse of his enemy's reflection in the shop windows now and then as he followed. The Shot. \u2014 Mr. Budd was close to the Dockyard gates when the assassin suddenly sprang forward ; the inspector turned, but a loud re port rang in his ears and a pistol ball struck him on the side ofthe face. Tbe weapon had been held close to his head, and the movement frus trated the murderer's intent, which was to send the bullet through his victim's brain. Mr. Budd at once seized his assailant, who was cocking his second pistol for his second task, when a policeman caught the hand that held it and disarmed him. Happily Mr. Budd was wounded only in the cheek ; the ball when extracted showed that it had been flattened against the cheek-bone. The principal accuser, however, was the prisoner himself, and the evidence lay in the sealed packet which he had left for the coroner. \" I have petitioned the Government,\" he said, \" and after taking away my former pension they have given me ninepence a day, though they know my full pension was not more than sufficient for existence. But a day of retribution will come. 1 write these lines to the coroner and jury who will sit on my body, and trust that they wiU consider the vile wrongs that have caused my murder. Mr. Traill, the magistrate, is an unjust man, or he would not have refused my application for a summons against Inspector Budd for wilful and corrupt perjury. But he could send me for trial on the word of a perjurer, who knew that I was not a thief. He is my murderer, backed by a rotten and infamous Government. William James Budd has worked my ruin, and I hope he has now wrought his own. I am tired of this life of persecution, and have determined first to shoot my perjurer and then myself. If this be called murder and suicide, then will it be for my persecutors to answer the crime. Mr 3d"], [504, "782 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Coroner and gentlemen of the jury, forgive the unfortunate wretch upon whom you are holding this enquiry. I trust I shall succeed in my intention and die in peace.\" There was a great deal more of the same kind of writing and a letter to Lord Palmerston of twenty-four pages, setting forth the unhappy man's claims and grievances. In this be said that the copper found upon him when arrested in 1854 was given to him for the purpose of making a soldering implement for a sailor in the Dockyard. The attempted murder was the subject of much attention in the town, and the police-court, as usual at important trials, was crowded whenever the prisoner was brought up. Mr. Budd recovered in a few weeks sufficiently to give his evidence on the last remand, October 30th, and the prisoner cross-examined him very astutely. The inspector said he had always expected the prisoner would do him harm, for he had heard him mutter, \" Revenge,\" as he passed him in the street. Trial. \u2014 Councill was tried at the Old Bailey in the following month and found guilty of wounding with intent to murder. Sentence of death was pronounced by Baron Bramwell, but was commuted to one of penal servitude for life. The man finished his miserable days in a criminal lunatic asylum. A Sad Affair. \u2014 Five years later the town was agitated by another remarkable event. It seems hard to account at this distance of time for the extraordinary excitement produced in the month of May, 1863, by the suicide of Mr. Roberts, a baker, of Coleman Street, Woolwich. True, he was well known and much respected, having been in business for twenty years, but had there been only suicide in the painful story it would not have made half the sensation it did, nor would it have been embalmed in the pages of this book. \" Who is the woman ? \" a philosopher has taught us to ask in every calamity, and, to begin at the beginning, I ought to introduce a servant girl named Frances Eliza Paxton, who had been in the employ of Mr. Roberts for about eighteen months. On Wednesday, May 13th, 1863, this young person presented herself at the police-station in William Street, accompanied by her father, and made a startling statement to Inspector Linvell. She said that on Sunday night ber mistress was out when her master took a bottle from a shelf, a bottle which she knew to contain vitriol, and told her to put some of it into the beer left for her mistress's supper in order to \"settle her.\" This injunction she cheerfully obeyed and then went to bed. Mrs. Roberts came home a little later and found her husband asleep on the sofa. She tasted the beer but could not drink it, and put it into a cupboard until next day. It should be stated that the police, judging as much from the girl's manner as from the improbability of ber story, disbelieved her from the first, but next morning the inspector"], [505, "783 MISHAPS AND TRAGEDIES. called upon Mr. Roberts and told him what his servant had said, adding that he had arrested her on her own confession for attempted murder. Mr. Roberts was much affected by the accusation, and said that the girl, having been discovered in her wicked act, had admitted her crime and charged one of the journeymen with suggesting it. The inspector asked him to attend the court in the afternoon and clear his character. Mr. Roberts promised to do so, but went and hanged himself in his stable. When the facts became known there was general sympathy for the deceased and his widow, and indignation towards tbe girl who had occasioned the trouble, and turned the head of her too-sensitive and unhappy master. At the inquest Mrs. Roberts was chief witness. She was in deep grief and seriously ill, but bravely defended the good name of her excellent husband. He was forty-four years of age and had been married to her twelve years. He was, she said, a healthy, sober, and good-tempered man. On the Sunday night she had been to her sister's, and returned home at twenty minutes to eleven. She did not wake him up, as he lay on the sofa asleep, and she did not have any supper. Tbe beer, having a bad taste, she put it into the cupboard until next day, when the servant girl wanted her to drink it at dinner. Witness took it to the Railway Tavern, where ihe girl said she had obtained it, and then it was discovered that vitriol was in it. Thereupon the girl was taxed with the crime and immediately confessed, saying that a man in her master's service had told her to poison her mistress. She was at once discharged, but was not given into custody. Two days later the girl sent her mother to say that Mr. Roberts had instigated the offence, and witness went with her husband to see her, when the girl first repeated this accusation and then said that neither he nor the journeyman nor anyone else had anything to do with it \u2014 that she did it of her entire free will. Verdict. \u2014 Much other evidence was given, and two days were con sumed in the inquiry. At the end of the first day the coroner summed up, but the jury could not agree as to the state of the deceased's mind. On the second it was clearly shown that his conduct had been that of a man who could not be held responsible for his actions, and the j ury returned a verdict of \" Temporary Insanity.\" Nemesis. \u2014 The girl Paxton was committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court, where an independent jury found her \" Guilty,\" and she was sentenced to imprisonment for three years. The Story of Laura Wilson. \u2014 A little more than twenty years passes and it is almost to-day. Now \u2014 3d2"], [506, "784 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Who comes here with noiseless tread Creeping to the lady's bed, With pallid cheek and fiery eye, Like wintry meteor in the sky ? \u2014 Wilmott. There are many amongst us to whom the memory of that gloomy Christmastide of 1884, ensanguined by one of the most fearful tragedies that Woolwich has ever encountered, will come like a shadow over their Christmas festivals so long as life endures. It was on the morning of Monday, December 22nd, that I received a call before daybreak, and found myself abroad in the raw winter morning, face to face with one of the most exciting and romantic events which it has been my fate to investigate and to chronicle. A young girl had been slain, stabbed in ber bedroom in the dead of the night ; the assassin had escaped ; her lover was suspected. This in brief was the story, but brevity in such a case is no virtue in a reporter's eye, and the details were eagerly sought out for the ears of the news-longing public. The Lovers. \u2014 Laura Wilson was seventeen years of age, and had from her childhood helped in tbe shop of her father, a carver and gilder, whose window ex hibition of pictures had for twenty years attracted the passers-by at No. 13, Beresford Street, not much more than a hundred yards from the main gate of Woolwich Arsenal. Frederick Marshall was aged twenty-one, and he had paid his addresses to Laura for nearly a year. He was the son of some excellent people (no one can better testify to their worthiness than myself), and he, too, had been piously trained, being regular in atten dance at his church and Sunday-school in Plumstead. But there was something un settled about his disposition, and he bad the repute of being always out of employment, which necessarily made the Wilsons solicitous for their daughter's welfare ; and, having some grounds to doubt his motives, the father of the girl denied the young man the house and forbade Laura to have any further ac quaintance with him. This was in the early part of December, when Laura Wilson had been for a week or two located under the roof of the next-door neighbour, Mrs. Hewitt, a widow, who kept the \" Beresford Cigar Stores,\" No. 14. Frederick Minshall."], [507, "MISHAPS AND TRAGEDIES. 785 The Shop Next Door.\u2014 Mrs. Hewitt had recently lost her husband, and, having an infant, took Laura as companion and help in tbe house and in the shop, an arrangement which was thought to be of advantage to Laura, whose knowledge of household duties had been gained only in the intervals of the picture-frame business, and was but slight. Mrs. Hewitt seems to have acted as the true friend of the young people, and it was understood that she was to keep the girl for a year, in which time it was expected that she would have had experience enough to be married and manage a home of her own. Just then, however, tbe parental edict of estrangement went forth, and, without introducing any collateral matters, it is only fair to say that the interference was quite justified by tbe circumstances. Laura was as obedient as she could be to her father's order, and avoided Marshall as far as she was able, but the young fellow was constantly haunting and watching the two adjoining shops, and even the interposition of the police, who were invoked, was unavailing to quell his passion. To the fierceness of his love he added the stimulant of jealousy. Another young man, named Charles Merritt, a second or third cousin, living in London, bad been accustomed to visit the Wilsons, and him Frederick Marshall suspected of supplanting him in the affections of his sweetheart. He had been heard to vow vengeance against both \"Charley\" and Laura, and to several of their mutual friends he boasted that he carried a dagger, which he also to some of them openly displayed, though, strange to say, no one suspected that he was in earnest. Several times he stole a momentary interview with the young girl, who treated him conside rately, but implicitly obeyed her father's instructions in refusing to renew the acquaintance, and there is little doubt that his brain, already weak, suffered increasing tortures and disorder at every such repulse. Sunday Night. \u2014 On the night of Sunday, December 21st, Charles Merritt was on a visit to the Wilsons, and Laura spent some time with him and some other members of the family in her father's house. Of this the watcher in the street was well aware, and he was goaded to the quick. There appears to have been some idea on the side of the Wilsons that he meditated mischief, for precautions were taken for Merritt's security as he returned to London by the railway, but he was unmolested, and Marshall remained watching in Beresford Street. If Mrs. Hewitt was a kind neighbour on the one side of the Wilson shop, there was another kind neighbour on the other. Mrs. Allen kept a coffee-house at No. 12, and to her on this same Sunday night young Marshall opened all the bitter vials of his grief. Tbe heart of the woman and the mother opened in sympathy towards him ; she gave him comfort and counsel, and be left the coffee-house about 11 o'clock, promising that he would go home and sleep away his troubles."], [508, "786 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. It was asserted at the subsequent enquiry that he did go home and to bed, but he seems to have arisen and returned to Beresford Street, where he was seen by witnesses as late as one o'clock in the morning. Stabbed to the Heart. \u2014 Mrs. Hewitt and her small household kept early hours, and soon after ten, having closed the cigar-stores, she and Laura and the baby went to bed. Laura slept alone in the front room over the shop ; Mrs. Hewitt occupied the bedroom at the back. Nothing to disturb them happened until half-past two in the morning, when Mrs. Hewitt, who was sitting up giving her babe some food, heard a scuffling noise in the front room, and had just time to call out, \" What is tbe matter ? \" when Laura rushed into her presence, exclaiming, \" I am stabbed, stabbed to the heart ! \" The poor girl fell fainting to the ground and expired almost immediately. Greatly agitated, Mrs. Hewitt knocked on the wall of Wilson's house, and in a few minutes Wilson and his wife and others came to her assistance. The Open Window. \u2014 The front room window was found open, and the means by which the assassin had entered and escaped were thus revealed. When the police arrived they found on the footpath fragments of mortar which had been broken from the facia, and, although it required an effort to suppose that anyone could have climbed up without assistance, the feat was afterwards accomplished by more than one person with comparative ease. Marshall had been a sailor for some time, and it was thought that, by the aid of a bit of lead pipe which protruded from the shop-front next No. 15, anyone so trained could at some risk have reached the poor girl's window. After the Crime. \u2014 At six o'clock on Monday morning Frederick Marshall returned home to the house of his parents at Majendie Road, Plumstead, and there he was apprehended by Police-sergeant Leonard. I saw and recognised him when he arrived at the police-station, silent, but calm and self-possessed. He spoke but very little, said that he did not know what he had done with his dagger, and that some slight stains of blood upon his shirt-cuff proceeded from a graze on his wrist. No symptoms of insanity were then apparent, and, even when his broken-hearted friends afterwards told of his strange ways, his delu sions, his head-pains and attempted suicide, it was difficult to detect any signs of mental deformity. On the afternoon of tbe same day he was taken before Mr. Balguy, and after a short enquiry was remanded. The same day also the inquest began at the Town Hall, and the two investigations proceeded side by side, at intervals, for several weeks. Frederick Marshall was committed to take his trial at the Central Criminal Court, but on January 29th, 1886, a few days before he should have stood at the bar,"], [509, "Shops in Beresford Street, Woolwich. A Sketch, to illustrate \" The Story of Laura Wilson.\" [To face page 786.] PLATE LXXVI."], [510, ""], [511, "787 MISHAPS AND TRAGEDIES. he was pronounced insane by the surgeons of Newgate, and sent to the Asylum for Criminal Lunatics at Broadmoor. This interference with the apparent course of justice created some excitement throughout tbe country, and in point of public interest no deed of blood at Woolwich has equalled in our time the love and murder romance of Laura Wilson. Such disasters are but one pace removed from murder, and might fairly be transferred to the calendar which follows. The events therein recorded commence with an almost forgotten story of Woolwich nearly seventy years ago. It is to this generation one of those Tales that have the rime of age, For scarcely any who now survive can remember the circumstances."], [512, "CHAPTER LX. W I L F II J, M U R D E It. Murders and Arson in Mulgrave Place. \u2014 A gravestone half- decayed, bearing the remains of a nearly obliterated inscription, stands in Wool wich Churchyard within a few yards of tbe vestry door, amid many other ancient and decrepid companions. If we can decipher it, it will tell us of the virtuous life and lamented death of Mr. John Thomas Parker and his faithful house keeper, Sarah Brown, who were both foully murdered, and their house set on fire, March 3rd, 1820. We may regret that time and neglect have left so little to be read of the words which were once so lovingly inscribed upon the stone, and it is only with pains we make No. 5, Mulgrave Place, 1820. out some fragments to inform us that Mr. Parker was in his lifetime- \"An affectionate husband, a kind father, and an unblemished man, who was barbarously murdered, his house plundered and burnt, and his body nearly consumed, by the atrocious act of an inhuman neighbour, who at the same time slew his faithful housekeeper, who hail for seven years ministered to her master's comforts.\" Even this partial quotation is of doubtful accuracy, but I have copied and interpreted it as carefully as I can before it quite disappears. The stone informs us clearly that Mr. Parker had passed his seventy-eighth year, a circumstance which is not referred to in the printed accounts of the tragedy. I cannot ascertain from this or any other available source the precise age of the housekeeper. Squire Parker. \u2014 Mr. Parker was reputed rich, and with good reason, for at his death, his daughter, who lived at Walthamstow, inherited \u00a31.5,000. \" Squire Parker,\" as he was called by the poor people of the locality, had lived for twenty-four years the life of a retired gentleman at the house which is now No. 5, Mulgrave Place, Woolwich, at that time a quiet rural spot, surrounded by fields. He"], [513, "789 WILFUL MURDER. had formerly been in business as a jeweller in Wilderness Row, Goswell Street, London, and was much respected both in tbe City and at Wool wich, being courteous, generous, and benevolent, living in comfortable style, at peace with all the world, and apparently without an enemy in existence. The house No. 5, Mulgrave Place, had, when I first knew it, become a shop. But, a year or two since, the shop was removed and betrayed the remains of the original front, which was that of a roomy abode of three floors, with wooden bay-windows, such as may be seen in other old houses adjacent, and were the outward and visible sign of gentility at the beginning of the century. The Midnight Assassin. \u2014 The murders are supposed to have been committed about midnight, and there is no doubt that the motive was avarice. The probability is that the assassin broke into the house expecting to find a large sum of money, and, being discovered by the inmates, killed them one after the other. He must have spent an hour or two ransacking the drawers, and fastening blankets against the windows, by which means be hoped to avert discovery until the evidences ofhis guilt were destroyed. lie then set fire to the house and walked away by the front door. The crime was so deliberately planned and cunningly executed that its perpetrator evidently hoped to escape detection, and there is every reason to believe that he remained close at hand all the night, watching tbe progress and extinction of the fire and the removal of the bodies. Inquest. \u2014 The inquest was held at the Red Lion, Mulgrave Place, before Joseph Carttar, Esq., coroner. The first witness was : \u2014 Thomas West, one of the Woolwich watchmen, who stated that about half-past two on Saturday morning, as he passed Mr. Parker's in Mulgrave Place, his attention was attracted by a smoke issuing from the top of the house. He rapped at the door, but there was no indication that he was heard. He listened and heard the crackling of wood, and then he sprang his rattle. The neighbours were alarmed, and soldiers came from the barracks. Fire was then seen raging in the parlour, and the soldiers broke in the door. John Hay, barrack master of AVoolwich Barracks, said he arrived at the house of Mr. Parker with an engine soon after the alarm was given, and went up-stairs. In the bedroom on the first floor there had been a fire, but it had gone out, the curtains of the bed being burnt. He went up to the room over and found that the bed there had also been in flames. The feathers were strewed .about, and there was a substance among them which looked like pitch. [The jury examined this and thought it was produced by the burning of the feathers.] Several drawers were open and articles of linen strewed about. At half-past two the fire in the parlour was got under. The door of the parlour was forced open and he went in. He saw a heap behind the door, which proved to be two human bodies, one stretched across the other. A man attempted to lift one of the bodies, but it came asunder. They were afterwards laid upon a table. One was a female, and he discovered two dreadful wounds over the eyes. She bled at the mouth and nose, but was quite dead. The other body was so"], [514, "790 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. much burnt that he could scarcely distinguish the human figure, except for the leg and foot, which remained perfect. Stephen Hannard, carpenter apprentice to Mr. Hudson, deposed that he resided with his mother in Mulgrave Place. He was alarmed by the cry of \" Fire,\" and went out. He fetched an adze and knocked the parlour door off its hinges. He broke the window from the outside and knocked in the shutters. He afterwards went up-stairs and found blankets nailed against the windows. The back door was fastened on the inside with a piece of timber. William Campion, a constable, said he went to the house after the fire had been extinguished. He found drawers and boxes open all over the house and property thrown about. A bunch of keys was found where the bodies lay. WiUiam Raven, shoemaker, was called to identify the bodies. He had known Mr. Parker and his housekeeper for several years, but it was impossible to recognise their remains. There was a black silk stocking and shoe on the foot of one of the bodies and he could swear to the shoe as being Mr. Parker's. He also felt certain that the other body was that of the housekeeper, Sarah Brown. Mr. Rideout, the high constable, said the shoe produced was taken from the remains of one of the bodies. W. Heaven, a shop-keeper in Mulgrave Place, said he was sure that the female body was that of Sarah Brown. He could not speak to the other. Isabella Jointure, living opposite Mr. Parker's house, said she saw the housekeeper on Friday at one o'clock carrying some meat from the butcher's. She saw Mr. Parker about four standing at the window with his spectacles on. She did not know his age. His housekeeper was at least fifty. Mr. William Patten, a surgeon, said he had examined the bodies and found an extensive fracture on the back of the head of the woman, and another fracture above the right eye. The face was disfigured by repeated blows. The other corpse was in a most dreadful state. The skull was still preserved and he discovered a piece of the parietal bone broken and depressed. These injuries were sufficient to have caused death, and had apparently been produced by a hammer. The wounds on the woman might have been given with the claw of a hammer. A cooper's hammer and a claw hammer were produced. These were found in the cellar under the parlour, the floor of which was burnt through. The jury found a verdict of \" Wilful Murder against some person unknown.\" The inquest concluded at midnight. The Murderer's Arrest. \u2014 Suspicion soon attached to a man named John Nesbit, a tailor. He was a native of Ireland, aged thirty-eight years, and had a wife and six children. His residence was within a few doors of Mr. Parker's house. He disappeared on the day of the murder, but the hue and cry went through the country, and a few days after wards he was arrested at Portsmouth. He had armed himself with two loaded pistols. Mr. Rideout, the high constable of Woolwich, went down to Portsmouth and brought him by the stage-coach to Woolwich ; a gold watch and several other articles belonging to Mr. Parker were found in his possession, and his guilt was clear and almost confess. A Bad Career. \u2014 It was proved that Nesbit had previously served for fourteen years in the Royal Artillery, and, although a man of superior intelligence, he had led a profligate and dishonest life. This was especially the case after he got free from the wholesome restraint"], [515, "WILFUL MURDER. 791 of his military service, and, at the very time of the murder, be was wanted by the watch for a burglary committed at Woolwich. When he fled he was traced and discovered owing to his infatuation for a woman with whom he had previously formed an acquaintance in France. She gave some remarkable testimony against him, stating that he had confessed to her that some time previously he had killed two men and a woman, an admission which he subsequently endeavoured to explain away by saying that the men fell in a duel and that the woman was but slightly hurt. Brought Back. \u2014 When the chaise brought him back to Woolwich, the whole population assembled to look at and to execrate the monster. It being necessary to take him before the bench of magistrates at the Castle Inn, a strong guard of artillery was called out to keep the street. The fellow was so overcome with fear of the mob that he had to be carried up to the justice room, saying that he could not bear the shouts of the people. He admitted that the property found upon him was \" Squire Parker's,\" but weakly declared that he had purchased it. Justice Avenged. \u2014 On the completion of the evidence the prisoner was committed for trial, and was walked, we are told, through \"an overwhelming mass of people\" to the Cage, where he had an affecting interview with his family, and whence he was taken in a chaise to Maidstone. There in due course he was tried, condemned and executed. There was much comment on the conduct of the Wool wich watch in not apprehending him for the burglary and thus have saved the crime, for he was proved to have been walking openly about the town for three or four days while the warrant was out against him ; but at that time there were only two constables to the whole population, and they were not a match for one such rogue. Remember that this all happened in 1820. A Murder on Parade. \u2014 The foregoing was certainly the most enthralling enormity of the penultimate generation, but those who remember 1839 will agree that a depth of horror seldom equalled was produced by the assassination of Sergeant-major Sheppard, Royal Artillery, on the parade ground in front of the barracks one peaceful Sabbath morning in the month of May of that year. Tbe following account of that lamentable tragedy was published on the succeeding day:\u2014 Yesterday (May 26th, 1839) .an atrocious murder was committed at the Royal Artil lery Barracks, Woolwich. The; victim is an uncommissioned officer of the name of Mr. William Sheppard, belonging to the second battalion of the Royal Foot Artillery, a man held high in the estimation amongst the officers in that garrison, and deeply respected by those whom he had command of. At Woolwich Garrison the men"], [516, "792 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. connected with the different regiments are every morning inspected by the sergeant majors of companies prior to their going on parade. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock the inspection had taken place and the men were assembling on the parade, Sergeant major Sheppard being in attendance and standing on the gravel walk gazing at his men. A private under his command, named George Williams, was on guard for the day, and was seen to come out of the west side of the garrison. He had his rifle in his hand, and looked about all the time. Directly he perceived Sergeant-major Shep pard he stepped back two or three paces, and placing his rifle to his shoulder, took aim from 18 yards' distance and fired. He then threw down his rifle and looked with a horrid grin upon his victim, whom he had stretched on the ground, dead. From a wound in his breast the blood gushed freely. Williams was seized by his comrades and exclaimed, \" I have shot him ; I have done for him.\" Dr. Richardson found that the bullet had passed completely through the body. Sergeant-major Sheppard had been thirty years in the regiment and in several of the Duke of Wellington's cam paigns. He was forty-nine years of age and left a wife and seven children. Williams was but eighteen years of age and had en- listed ten months before. The inquest was attended by Lord Bloom- Sergeant-major Sheppard's Tomb. field and other officers, and Lieutenant George William Bingham was called as one of the witnesses to the murder. The prisoner was described as a sullen man and a bad soldier. A Public Funeral. \u2014 The funeral of Sergeant-major Sheppard was attended by the Commandant and most of the officers, and the high constable and a posse of peace officers led the procession. The appear ance of the deceased's children as chief mourners excited much com miseration. The procession was a mile long. The body was buried in Woolwich Churchyard, and the monument represented above was erected by subscription. Six days after the lamentable event the widow of the sergeant-major died of grief. The prisoner was tried, condemned and executed. A proposal was made to Lord John Russell by the Commandant that the prisoner should be hanged at Woolwich as an example, but it was not thought desirable to act upon the sugges tion, and the feeling of sorrow and aversion throughout the garrison was so great that no example was believed to be necessary. The murderer therefore met his death at Maidstone Goal, and died unre pentant."], [517, "PLATE LXXVII. View of the Royal Artillery Barracks in 1820, (Facsimile of old Print.) [To foce page 792.]"], [518, ""], [519, "WILFUL MURDER. 793 The Murderous Bayonet.\u2014 It was formerly the rule that soldiers should wear their side-arms whenever they were in uniform. The folly of the custom was forcibly illustrated by the murder of Mrs. Elizabeth Browning, the landlady of the Britannia Tavern, at Wool wich, on Monday the 27th of April, 1835. That custom has long been discontinued, but only after a hard struggle against prejudice and habit, and after many more examples of its fatal consequences. Its advocates thought it an insult to deprive the soldier of his arms, and ignored the ready means which the weapon so often suggested of turning a hasty quarrel into the sorrowful sacrifice of human life. Widow Browning and her Customer.\u2014 The Britannia stood, as it now stands, at the junction of Henry Street and Chapel Street, near the Dockyard Station, and, being convenient to the Royal Marine (now the Cambridge) Barracks, was the resort of a corporal of that regiment named Patrick Carroll, who appears to have been enamoured of the widow landlady, by whom his addresses, if not encouraged, were not rejected with sufficient firmness to repel her admirer and customer. Not many months before, her husband had committed suicide, and her mother lived with her as companion and helper in the business. The other circumstances are explained in the following evidence. In Court. \u2014 -The murder made a great consternation in the town. During the morning, as it became known, hundreds of people flocked to the Castle Inn, where the magistrates held their petty sessions, and intense anxiety was manifested by the crowd to get a sight of the prisoner as he was conveyed from the Cage to the court. He arrived shortly after one o'clock and was with difficulty got through the throng. On entering the dock he hung his head and appeared bitterly to feel his position. He was a native of Ballyboy, Ireland, and thirty one years of age. He bad previously served seven years in the 7th Regiment of Fusiliers, and on his discharge joined the Marines, where he was made corporal. It was rumoured at first that the prisoner and Mrs. Browning were married, but this proved untrue. William Chittenden deposed : \u2014 I am one of the police-officers of the parish of Woolwich. This morning about 11 o'clock, from information, I went to the Britannia public-house, and saw an escort of Marines. I said, ' ' Where is the man who has stabbed Mrs. Browning i* \" and the prisoner said, \" I am the man ; I stabbed her. It is a bad job ; I know my doom.\" I conveyed him to the watch-house, and then returned to the Britannia. In one of the chambers I found the body of Mrs. Brown ing. She was lying on a sofa undressed, and I saw five distinct stabs in her bosom. I received the bayonet, now produced, from the deceased's mother. (The weapon was covered with blood except about an inch of the hilt.) William Owen, said : \u2014 I am a discharged marine, and reside at the Britannia. Last night the prisoner was there nearly all the evening and was very riotous. I called a watchman and we got him out. This morning about ten o'clock I saw the prisoner in the house ; he was stabbing away at everybody with his bayonet. I saw"], [520, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 794 him stab Mrs. Browning two or three times with it. Before I could get at her she was almost dead. I picked her up and she died in my arms. I have seen the prisoner at the Britannia for a long time. I have seen him strike the deceased, and he has ill-used her once or twice before. Elizabeth Blake deposed :\u2014 I am a lodger at the Britannia. This morning about ten Corporal Carroll came in. Mrs. Browning was at the bar and the prisoner asked her if she would speak to him. She said she did not wish to speak to Mm nor any such brute as he was, after calling her what he did last night. He asked her twice or three times to speak to him, but she would not. He then went inside of the bar, and began to abuse her. She wanted him to go out, but he said he would not. He then toned about and began striking her. I heard Mrs. Browning say, as I left the bar, \" Don't begin to ill-use me.\" In about ten minutes afterwards I heard a scream, and ran to the bar, where I saw the prisoner with the bayonet in his hand. Sir John Webb : When the prisoner came into the house had he the bayonet in his hand 1\u2014 No, he had a belt on and the bayonet in the sheath. What do you think gave rise to the quarrel .\u2014 Last night Mrs. Browning had some persons to tea and the prisoner was angry because he was not asked to join the party. He said he would pay her for it and would do for her. She had kept the Britannia eight years and had known the prisoner two years. Were they married or in the habit of associating together as man and wife 1\u2014 Not to my knowledge. The prisoner was committed to Newgate for trial and taken to London by steamboat. At the inquest held next day great surprise was expressed at the prisoner not being present, according to the prevailing custom. He was executed at Maidstone on the 23rd May, in the presence of four thousand persons, some of whom were females with infants at the breast. After the rope was round his neck he read distinctly a long written confession, in which he acknowledged the justice of his sentence and warned others to avoid his example, to refrain from evil passions and shun drink. Among the curiosities of literature in the National Library is a collection of broadsides, chiefly the pro duction of the \"Catnach\" press in Seven Dials. One of these catchpenny sheets is devoted to a wretched report of the \" Life, Trial Mrs. Elizabeth Browning, from a broadsheet ofthe murder, 1835. and Execution of Patrick Carroll,\" with the customary \" Last dying"], [521, "795 WILFUL MURDER. speech and copy of verses written by the criminal.\" From this \" autho rity \" I copy the accompanying \" portrait \" of Mrs. Browning, and extract the following lines : \u2014 In Woolwich as may plain be seen I did belong to the Marine, And never thought my Fate woidd be, To die upon the Fatal Tree. (Chorum) \u2014 Then pray a warning take by me, Think of the Woolwich Tragedy. A chorus on such a theme as that ! A Sailor's Vengeance. \u2014 The bayonet was again the instrument of death in the next case, but under very different circumstances, which are most strongly impressed upon my mind. Was it because Woolwich was so much smaller then than now, that my recollection of the stir which the crime of George Bave created is so vivid ? Or is it that the inexperience of tbe narrator led him to mistake for public interest that which was merely excitement within his own untutored mind ? Probably the latter, for it was in the Days when I was green in judgment ; and as there had been no capital offence brought within the scope of my avocation, I was awe-struck at my first view of a murderer. Tbe event, however, was certainly strange for the town, as there had been no such serious charge for nearly twenty years, and consequently \" The Woolwich Murder \" was a less familiar line than, alas, it has been of later years. The Receiving Ships. \u2014 It was during the peaceful early months of 1857, which followed the Crimean War and preceded the Mutiny in India, that two hulks were lying at the Dockyard, above the flagship Fisgard, and these were generally employed as depots for seamen pend ing their disposal among the ships in commission. One of these hulks was the Hebe, and she was the scene of murder. The Murderer. \u2014 George Bave had led an adventurous life, and, although he was said to be, and appeared to be, of a mild and kindly disposition, had undoubtedly acquired the corrupted manners which come of evil communications. After joining her Majesty's Navy as a seaman at about the age of twenty years, he had for eleven years lived among uncivilised tribes in the interior of Africa, having deserted from one of her Majesty's ships on the coast, and fled into the heart of the country, where he may have become imbued with the vengeful customs and disregard for consequences which are characteristic of most untaught savages."], [522, "796 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Twelve months before the murder on board the Hebe he made bis way, by a series of strange experiences, to one ofthe British stations, and gave himself up, and, as he wanted, and was wanted, \"to fight the Rooshans,\" he was, with some slight punishment, sent back to his duty. Arriving in course of time at Woolwich Dockyard, he was attached to the Msgard with the crew of the S/aney gunboat, then in dock preparing for China, the whole of the crew being berthed on board the Hebe. He was a big, rough, good-looking fellow, with a dark complexion and bright, intelligent eyes. What he lacked in polish he made up in courage, for he never shrank during the terrible ordeal through which he had to pass. He deeply repented, however, of his anger, and his chief anxieties were for the friends of his victim and for bis own Woohcich Dockyard in 1857, showing the Guardship and Hulk-depOt. relatives, two sisters and two brothers, who had not seen him for many years, but were attracted by the report of his arrest in the papers, and came sorrowing to his cell. Revenge, at first though sweet, Bitter ere long back on itself recoils. The Victim. \u2014 Samuel Long was a corporal in the Royal Marines. He was thirty-three years of age, had been fourteen years in the regiment, and was a good steady soldier. He was a finely built man of nearly six feet in height. As ship's corporal he was responsible for the preservation of order and discipline, and there is no question that the wild and wilful habits which Bave had contracted brought the two"], [523, "WILFUL MURDER. 797 men into frequent friction. On tbe 6th of April, Bave broke his leave on shore, and returned to his ship two days late. This was reported in the ordinary course by the corporal, and the captain stopped the offender's leave until further orders. Two days after, being Good Friday, the prisoner took a boat from alongside, went on shore and brought some beer on board, which was altogether a serious crime against naval discipline, aud the consequence was a lecture from the captain and the revocation of a promised promotion. On the 20th of April the man went on shore again without leave and was again reported by the corporal. For this he was sentenced to be put in irons for twenty-four hours, and the corporal had to administer the punishment, which still further excited the hatred and vengeance of the miserable culprit, who was heard using bitter language towards tbe man who was but the instrument of the law. The Sin Of Cain. \u2014 Murder, deliberate and premeditated, was the fruit of all this stubborn insubordination, this hot hatred and uncon trolled resentment \u2014 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind The savageness of unreclaimed blood. On the night of Thursday, April 23rd, about nine o'clock, George Pave obtained possession of the corporal's own bayonet, taking it secretly from the place where Long had left it, and, instead of turning into his hammock as he should have done at that hour, concealed him self behind a coal-box on the main deck, waiting in a treacherous and vengeful mood until his victim should come round to see \"lights out.\" As the corporal passed, the murderer plunged the bayonet into his right side, piercing nearly through the body. Long cried, \" I'm murdered ! \" and several of the crew appeared, but Bave stood forth with the blood stained weapon aloft, saying \u2014 \" I am the man who has done it ; defend if you can ; my neck for it ; to-morrow I could die.\" He stood gazing at the dreadful work he bad done, and after a while quietly gave up the bayonet, saying \u2014 \" I have had my wish; I don't want to hurt anyone else.\" Lighting his pipe, he smoked, standing by the side of tho prostrate corporal. Then he was made prisoner and sent on board the Fisgard, while the injured man was taken on shore to the Royal Marine Hospital, where he died just twenty-four hours after the wound was inflicted. Justice.\u2014 At the inquest and examination of the prisoner there was no witness who actually saw the fatal blow, and it was suggested that there might have been a quarrel between the two men, in which the 3 E"], [524, "798 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. corporal had first drawn the bayonet, but the circumstances were too clear, and the prisoner's admissions too convincing of the facts, and he was in due course convicted, sentenced, and executed. A Ghastly Relic. \u2014 On the day in which the murderer was hanged at Maidstone a boy prisoner on remand showed me in the cells at Wool wich a sailor's cap, which he said had belonged to Bave, who had given it to him in the gaol. He offered the cap to me for a consideration, and I thought it was probably spurious, but bare suspicion made it too horrible a thing to touch. A Murder in the Arsenal. \u2014 The blood-guilty act of Edward Bave may be set down as a record of Woolwich Dockyard. Tbe history of the Royal Arsenal also furnishes us with an instance of that crimo which is the most dreadful in the category of human sins. In 1801 the military still did duty in the Arsenal, and it was usual for the pickets to \"run in \"at that convenient station any soldiers whom they might make prisoners during their perambulation of tbe town. Thus it happened that on the evening of Monday, July Sth, 1861, Peter Masterson, a gunner belonging to the Royal Artillery, was arrested by a party of the Garrison Military Police, then just established, and conveyed to the Arsenal guard-room. Sergeant Martin Murphy, R.A., who was doing piquet duty, was in the guard room at the time, and asked Masterson his name, when the prisoner, who was under the influence of drink, exclaimed \u2014 - \" You knew my name when you gave me three months.\" Another sergeant interposed, and to him the man was more courteous and gave his name, but he added \u2014 \" I have had three months for throwing a quart-pot at Sergeant Murphy, but I'll serve him out yet before I go to India.\" Sergeant Murphy, who was about thirty years of age and had been fourteen years in the army, said nothing to provoke the prisoner, but took down his name and sat writing at the guard-room table, while Masterson lay for a while on the sloping planks of the guard-bed to await removal to the barracks. Nobody seems to have taken further notice of him for nearly half an hour, and Murphy was still sitting at the talole, when suddenly Masterson was seen standing behind him with a heavy bar of iron upraised in his hands. Several of the bystanders rushed forward, but too late. The iron descended with fearful force upon the head of the unfortunate sergeant and proved to be his death blow. The weapon was a crowbar used as tbe guard-room poker, and the prisoner bad secretly taken it from the coal-box. He only struck one blow when he was overpowered, and then be said, \" I wish I had killed him.\" His wish was accomplished, for the sergeant, after linger-"], [525, "799 WILFUL MURDER. ing between life and death for four days, died from the effect of his injury. He was to have been married on the following Sunday. The murderer was twenty-three years of age, bad in character, and evil-looking. Oft of the soul the body form doth take, For soul is form and doth the body make. When he was handed over to the police he said \u2014 \" It can't be helped ; I did not mean to kill him.\" \" Worse Luck.\" \u2014 The evidence, however, was too strong for him, and, though an effort was made to reduce the crime to one of man slaughter, he was convicted of \" Wilful Murder \" at the Central Criminal Court and sentenced to death. Ho laughed when the judge finished, and said \u2014 \" Worse luck ! \" He was executed at Maidstone on .September 19th, 1861, and carried out his resolution to \" die game.\" The Slave and her Master. \u2014 In the catalogue of capital crimes must be included the case of George Durling, who was hanged at Maidstone on tbe 23rd of August, 1881, for the murder of a hapless woman in a low lodging-bouse at Cannon Row, Woolwich, on the 26th of the preceding month. The details of the story were vile and almost lacking in interest, for the actors in the tragedy were of the most degraded and despised order of human kind, and the evidence was precisely such as is commonly met with in the accounts of brutal con flicts which come so frequently before the police-courts, plus the mere accident of a fatal termination. The \"Dusthole.\"\u2014 George Durling was one of the rough and depraved fellows who live among the \"miserables\" of tho region yclept \"the Dusthole,\" and his victim, Fanny Mussel, was his slave. Tyranny and torture are the ordinary laws of such a sovereignty, and Fanny appears to have had ber share of sorrow under the yoke of her hard master. At length she rebelled, refused to provide him with some paltry pence which he wanted for his customary refreshment, and even dared to defy his authority. In pursuance of this rebellion she took herself out of his presence, and he followed to chastise her. Pur suing her into tho back-yard of a house adjacent, where she had fled from him, the man seized an iron rod (a slender substitute for a poker), which lay too ready to his hand, and struck at ber in his blind resentment. The rod appears to have slipped from his hand, for the point of it penetrated the brain of Fanny Mussel, and she died next day at the Union Infirmary. Durling was arrested, and within a month be had paid the direst penalty which the law enacts. 3e2"], [526, "800 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Was it Wilful Murder ? \u2014 The case was undoubtedly one of man slaughter rather than murder, but there had been many cases of bru tality to women of the same class about this time, and the need of a salutary lesson probably underlay the verdict and tho sentence. A few weeks before, a man who kicked his wife to death at Eltham was let off by a blundering judge with six weeks' imprisonment, a circum stance which had created a strong public seeling against sucb intolerable leniency, and this also had something to do with George Durling's fate. However, his conduct, and character were such as to deprive him of tbe slightest sympathy, and it was felt that, whatever were his intentions when he raised the iron rod to smite his cringing serf, be thoroughly deserved his punishment. Fanny Mussel, wdio had several aliases, was a well-favoured girl, and the prisoner was said to have been, in spite of his cruelty, very fond of her. She came from Weymouth, and had been in Woolwich six years when she met her end. The Plumstead Poisoner. \u2014 That Louisa Jane Taylor was a murderess of the blackest dye there can be no question, and she went to her doom without a sigh of pity from anyone acquainted with even the least of her villainies. Her very sex enhances her cruelties, and tbe enormityr of ber crimes, though but half-revealed, renders her quite unworthy to be called woman. Wc are told that \u2014 The whole storm is one injurious woman. The lightning, followed with the thunderbolt, Is marble-hearted woman. But happily she stands alone and unapproached in these Records. Louisa Jane Taylor, nee Scott, has a claim, wliich no one will dispute, to occupy a special pinnacle as the most venomous and infamous creature that the Woolwich district bas ever brought forth within its written history. She is said to have been born in Warwick Street, near tbe Dockyard, about the year 1840, her father being a dockyard workman ; but no thing certain is known of ber parents, and it may be hoped, for the sake of finding even this slight excuse for her, that they died when she was very young. Louisa Jane Taylor. A Strange Character.\u2014 Yet \" Lou Scott,\" as she was called, was a remarkable woman, clever and well-informed, having a masculine rather than a feminine brain, and a man's courage. Her training, amid scenes of vice, served to cultivate in sin a disposition naturally bad, and yet, even in her deepest depravity and degradation, she con-"], [527, "801 WILFUL MURDER. trived by her shrewdness of intellect to make a way for herself through the world where less daring spirits would have succumbed. Companions of her own sex, only less vile than herself, dreaded \" Lou Scott,\" and marvelled at her power of fascination, for she was but an ill-favoured creature, tall and powerful, with her manlike mind revealed in a face frightfully scored by smallpox ; and still she held a place in the first rank of her profligate class. The portrait shows her at the age of forty. Addison, paraphrasing Martial, once said of an ill-favoured follow : \u2014 With all these tokens of a knave complete, Should' st thou be honest thou'rt an awful cheat, But Miss Scott made friends in spite of her face. She even induced a man to marry her \u2014 a man fairly respectable \u2014 for Thomas Taylor, her husband, was an engineer and had held a commission in the Royal Navy. Once in her frequent appearances at the police-court she was charged with attempting to poison herself with sugar of lead ; and sugar of lead was her atrocious instrument of murder all through her wretched existence. There was very little doubt that several murders might have been laid to her charge, and the circumstances of ber husband's death, in the earljr part of 1882, left no question when they came to be investigated that he was one of her victims. The crime for which she was ultimately brought to justice and cut short in her shameful course was perpetrated for a motive so slight and uncertain, and with such open and reckless daring, as to show a contempt for consequences only to be accounted for by a familiarity with the poisoner's dreadful practice, and a fancied immunity begotten of frequent escapes. The mainspring was, however, as will be seen, \u2014 The lust of gold, unfeeling and remorseless. The Cottage at Plumstead. \u2014 An aged couple, William Tregellis and his wife, lived in a cottage beside the railway at Plumstead, just behind tbe Railway Tavern, and called No. 3, Neyler's Cottages. Tre gellis had been an Excise officer and had a small pension, which, as he was eighty-six years of age, he could not have hoped long to enjoy. Thomas Taylor was also at one time in tbe Excise, and henco the parties became acquainted at a period when tbe Taylors were residing at Little Heath, Charlton. In August, 1882, six months after her husband's death, Louisa Jane Taylor, his widow, paid a visit to tbe cottage of Tregellis, and, being in need of a home, proceeded to establish herself there and be comfortable. Two months later she was arrested on some trifling charge of robbing the old man, and she was never free again until she received her quit tance at the hands of the executioner. During her examination for the theft she stood smiling contemptuously in the dock at Woolwich Police-"], [528, "802 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Court, for no one had as yet spoken of anything beyond the paltry charge, but she had upon her soul the consciousness of deeper sins, and may bave heard the inward accuser's warning : \u2014 Tremble, thou wretch, That hast within thee undivulged crimes Unwhipped of justice. Whilst she was under remand, the police, who knew her well, sound it desirable to make some enquiries respecting her habits. A Death-bed Accusation. \u2014 Old Mrs. Tregellis, who was slowly and contentedly dying, as she thought from natural decay, was visited by a magistrate, Mr. Marsham, on Tuesday, October 10th, and gave her death-bed testimony. Mrs. Taylor was also present in charge of the police, but, notwithstanding tbe commotion among the neighbours, and the hooting which greeted her, she wore a defiant air and smiled. She did not know then, that which she learnt soon afterwards, that her poor victim had been medically certified to be suffering from lead poison, and that a chain of evidence had already been woven which would lead her to the scaffold. The prisoner was arraigned at the bed's soot, and tbe invalid kissed the book, and said \u2014 My name is Mary Ann Tregellis. The prisoner, Louisa Jane Taylor, has been staying here as a visitor. I was in good health before she came, but then I got ill and had the doctor, and Mrs. Taylor always gave me my medicine. I was generally sick and in pain after a dose. Magistrate. \u2014 Did you ever see anything done to the bottles ! Yes ; I saw Mrs. Taylor once put a white powder in the medicine, and when she gave it to me it was so hot and sour that I could not drink it. She said, \" You must take it,\" and I did, and it made me very bad. Have you tasted anything like it at any other time ? Something like it, only not so strong. Prisoner.\u2014 You often used to say there was powder in the medicine when there was no powder at all. I only know that I never had a powder. Mrs. Tregellis.\u2014 You had a powder, Mrs. Taylor ; don't you remember I Prisoner.\u2014 It's no use asking her any questions. She is not sensible enough to know what you 6ay. A Bide. \u2014 The court then adjourned from the sick-room, and tho prisoner was taken back to the police-station. There should have been a cab waiting, but there was not, and Mrs. Taylor was led away through a yelling and pursuing crowd, gathering in multitude as it went. Luckily the workhouse bread van was passing, and was pressed into the police service. Gilham, the gaoler, hoisted his prisoner on board, and, with Inspector Phillips, a few detectives, and your humble servant, to form the poisoner's retinue, the queer conveyance soon left the crowd behind. Strange event in the day's diary : \" First ride with a murderess.\""], [529, "803 WILFUL MURDER. The Motive of Murder. \u2014 There were several remands and a great deal of evidence, amongst the other proofs against the prisoner being the purchase of sugar of lead on two or three occasions at the surgery of Mr. John Smith, the very surgeon who had been attending the deceased. The husband (Tregellis) also informed the court that the prisoner had proposed to him that after his wife's death he should take her for his housekeeper, and let ber manage his pension ; and this was the only apparent motive of the crime. Mrs. Taylor bad some of the old man's money in her possession when apprehended. Equity. \u2014 Mrs. Tregellis died on October 23rd, and the Woolwich Brinvilliers, Louisa Taylor, after being tried at the Old Bailey, and convicted of \" Wilful Murder,\" was ignominiously hanged at Maidstone, on January 2nd, 1883. She made no statement of confession or con trition, and she went to her fate without a shudder of fear or a word of repentance, as hardened and as foul a fiend as ever sullied the gentle name of woman."], [530, "APPENDIX. Page 14. \u2014 The Name of Woolwich. Mr. Ehodes offers the following conjectures :\u2014 The local nomenclature of the Thames is Danish from London to the Norc ; each reach of the Thames is a survival of the Danish r\u0153hke, to unwind, which is the exact meaning of the word when applied to a river. (See Streatfield's \" Lincolnshire and the Danes,\" p. 201.)

You have Less-ness (Loisness formerly), the Ness or nose in tho waters (L'eaux), as in several other places in England.

If the name is English, we can only derive it from Anglo-Saxon JTull, \" wool\" and win, \"village.\" You say, however, at page 146, \" the church chronicles go back to a.d. 400.\" This would imply that tho town was of British foundation, and we may suppose that when the pa \"an English came (some time perhaps in the latter part of the fifth century) they adopted \"the old name. AVc know that this is what happened in the case of York. There the British name of Ebranc or Efranc was adopted by tho English invaders, who twisted it into Eoforwie, to make it easier to say. Some such borrowing and altering may perhaps have happened to the original of the name of AAToolwich. In any case wold has nothing to do with the matter \u2022 it is an unusual form ioi weald, or wala. \"I cannot find that wo; ever means \" gloom.\" And ivolic and u-ulice (not woliclie) are out of the question, for they are derived, not from tool, but from wo or u-u/i, \" crooked,\" or \"wrong.\" Isolde meaning old is not Anglo-Saxon at all, but illustrates the peculiarity in some dialects at a later date of prefixing w to words beginning with o. I am glad to air the theories of my critics and leave the reader to decide. It would ill become mo to contend with such authorities, but I may point to tho use of wold, for old in its application to Eltham (tho old ham) at pago COG, where it is spoken of as Woldham in connection with an event so far remote as a.d. 970, and well within the Anglo-Saxon period. In our caso I have thought that tho prefix Wol had probably broadened into Wool before tho Domesday Book was written. Then the transition from Wool with the Saxon \" uric\" to Hoot (hid) with the Norman viz (Hulviz in the Domesday) would have been an easy process. Wool is still IIool in the west country, where they say : \u2014 Put the ship's-head (sheep's head) in tho pot The /tool and the horns together. The word wolanche, \" unjustly,\" I found in Ilalliwell's Archaic Dictionary, and is probably a mere coincidence. It is spelt, perhaps more correctly, u-olicc in Bosworth's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. Tho samo author translates toolcn \" a cloud,\" which is figuratively \" gloom.\" Page IS. \u2014 The Royal Manor. Edward III. proclaimed that tho men of Wool wich, Eltham, and Modingham wero to be exempt from repairing Deptford Bridge. They wero also freed from various tolls and liabilities from timo immemorial as tenants of the royal manor. Page 20. \u2014 Chichele. Tho Eev. H. R.

There is a legend which tells us that St. rotor descended in the seventh century to dedicate tho now church which tho King of tho East Saxons had built at Westminster on the ruins ofthe temple of Apollo, but alighted on tho Surrey side, and had some difficulty in finding anyone to carry him over. This pious service was rendered hy Edric, a fisherman, who was consequently rewarded with a miraculous draught of salmon, and a promiso that if ho would givo a tenth of his possessions to the church he should never want for plenty of fish.

In \" AVriothesley's Chronicle \" (vol. 2), wo aro told that \u2014 About the 7 and S Oct. 1552, two great fishes called whirlpooles (or whales) were taken and slavne about Wollwich, which were chased 2 dayes and 2_nightes ere they were shine, and they were drawne at 2 barges through London Bridge the ix. of October, and so brought to the Kinge's bridge at his place of \"Whitehall to ehewe the Kinge, who came thither after his progresse the x. of October at night. Tho \"terrible monster taken by a fisherman near Woolwich in 1642 \" (pago 31), is suggested by Mr. P. F. Thomas to have been, not an octopus, but a stray siren or manatee (tho origin of the fabled mermaid), which has an approximation to human hands and fingers, and some approach to a toadlike or human form. p;1R0 34. \u2014 Barne or Barnes. Sir George Barnc was Lord Mayor, 1552 ; another Sir George Barno was Lord Mayor, 1586. The s was added to tho namo hy Sir William Barnes, of AVoolwich, who died in 1619. He was father of Annio, who becamo tho wife of Sir William Lovelace, and mother of Richard Lovelaco, the poet (vide pedigree at page 200). Sir William was probably grandfather or great-unclo of \"Master AVilliam Barnes, a Cavalier.\" Tho family ceased to bo connected with Woolwich in the seventeenth century. Pago 35. \u2014 The Woolwich Stone. As the deep sandpits at Lower Charlton gave tho namo of tho \" Woolwich beds \" to the strata thoro exposed, so it may be sug gested that tho fossils therein discovered may have been designated \"Woolwich stones.\" Mr. P. F. Thomas, of Plumstead, thinks they wero tho small coin-liko Nummulites, one of which was probably given to Pepys. Pago 44. \u2014 The Green Dragon, Woolwich. Mr. W.

I usod to catch eels besido it from Bull's (now Taylor's) wharf.\" Pago 47. \u2014 The Co-operative Mill. Tho mill built by the shipwrights appears to bo the first co-operative effort of which this country has any trace In Holy oako's Self-Hip a Hundred Years Ago it is stated that tho Bishop of Durham was tho inventor of tho principle, and that he applied it to a village-shop at Monge woll in Oxfordshire in 1794, for the benefit of tho poor, his example being followed in 1800 by Rev. Dr. Glasse, of Greenford, near Harrow, Middlesex. Mr. Holy oako also says that the oldest co-operative corn mill was established at Hull in 1795, another being commenced a year later on Barham Downs. But tho co operative mill of the Woolwich shipwrights was certainly in existonco as early as 1760, and I have obtained positive proof that this was the same mill which stood in Mill Lane as shown in Mr. Clifton's picturo (Plate XVI., page 90). Tho pro perty was sold about sixty years since, and the proceeds divided among the descendants of the Dockyard people who founded it. Pago 51. \u2014 Woolwich Market. The market in Beresford Squaro was legally established on tho lst of September, 18S8. Tolls, varying from 6d. upwards, were imposed, and realized \u00a3620 in the first year, or nearly \u00a312 a week. Mr. Hunt, an cx-police constable, was appointed collector and market keeper, and the regulations were accepted as a welcome improvement upon tho previous disorder. Page 56. \u2014 Green's End.

It occupied part of the site of the Red Barracks and was approached by a remnant of tho Bowater House Road shown on tho plan at pago 52. The Government pond was called simply \" tho reservoir \" in 1806, when tho land upon which tho meat storo stands was taken as a right of way to it from John Burkett and his wife (lato Mary Wellard), for ninety-eight yoars at \u00a314 12s. 6d. per annum.

When, in 1834, the Woolwich Steam Packet Company was established, there was no pier for some time provided, and tho watermen charged a penny to carry each passenger to and fro between the land and tho boats. According to the minutes of tho Watermen's Company an agree- ment was come to between tho Steamboat Company and the watermen, by which a small toll per passenger was to bo allowed the latter as compensation, provided the watermen would build a pier and assist tho steamers. The watermen accordingly purchased a barge, steps, etc., to form a floating pier, and petitioned the Navigation Committee of tho Watermen's Company to construct the pier. Mr. Roff, wharf- inger, also made a similar application, but was refused, while tho memorial of the watermen was granted and their pier erected. Some time afterwards Mr. Roff renewed his request and it was acceded to. Tho two piers seen in tho drawing at page 117 existed together, and tho Steam Packet Company, after trying Mr. RofFs for awhile, returned to tho older landing of tho watermen at Bell Water-gate. Thereupon Mr. Roff sold his shares in the company and formed the Eagle and Falcon Company, whose boats used his pier on the journey to Gravesend, but soon ceased to call there. In 1S35 a bill was promoted for a new pior at Woolwich, but it was not proceeded with. In 1S36 a new company was formed in the name of \"the Black wall and Woolwich Steam Packet Company,\" and its boats commenced running to and from London in Juno, but it does not appear to have had a long existence. In 1839 tho competition between tho two piers continued, and in the year previous Mr. Roff lowered his pier dues to a halfpenny a-head, which tho watermen were compellod to do likewise. Mr. Druett then applied to the Naviga tion Committee for leavo to construct a pier at Hog Lane (Nile Street), and the watermen opposed. Tho committee thereupon gave permission to the watermen to build the proposed now pier on condition that both thoir piers should be open to all steamboats. Mr. Kofi's pier had then been somo months closed, and the"], [534, "808 APPENDIX. watermen, to extinguish tho possibility of a rival, purchased it, but in 1840 the AVoolwich Steam Packet Company leased Roff's Wharf for twenty-eight years at \u00a3150 per annum, and tho present pier was erected. The watermen appealed to tho Lord Mayor's Court for redress, but were defeated, and then formed the ill-fated Watermen's Steam Packet Company. Pa\"e 119. \u2014 Water Journey.

The baths were of advantago in teaching the youth of tho town to swim, and for a good many yoars the hall, being the only large room in tho locality, was used for public meetings and entertainments, accommodating about seven hundred persons. But as an investment it was never a success, aud as other halls were provided the old lecture hall was deserted, and the baths were closed in 18S8. The whole building is now used for a furniture repository. Page 122. \u2014 Goldsmiths' Almshouses.

In that cottago lived Widow Gordon, who was at AVaterloo with her husband, and nursed tho Marquis of Anglesea when ho lost his leg. Sir Edward's mother, Lady Perrott, was first cousin of the Marquis and favourite niece of his father, the Earl of Uxbridge.

Page 22S.^Our Lady Hill. The apparent blunder of connecting \" Our Lady Hill\" with St. Mary's Church in 1545 has not escaped the notice of several critics, seeing that tho patron of the church is Mary Magdalen (pago 148) and not \" Our Blessed Lady tho Alrgin.\" But the solecism is probably an ancient one, and. seems to have deceived Thomas Heth, who was in 1455 buried, according to the terms of his will, in \"the porch of the Blessed Mary, AA'oolwich \" (pago 167).

That error dies hard is proved by the following extract from a leading article in a local newspaper of the recent date of October 5th, 1888:\u2014 \"Every school-boy knows that AAroolwich originated through the capacity of a workman. In the beginning ofthe eighteenth century (about 1716 or thereabouts) there happened to visit the then Government factory in Moorfields, a young German named Andrew Sehalch. He was doing his u-anderjahr, his year of travelling to see the ways of other countries, which was then considered, in Germany, essential to make an artisan perfect in his craft. The German apprentice, watching the moulds being prepared for the metal in the Moorfields factory, saw that they had been left damp, and that on the metal being poured in nothing could prevent an explosion. He warned those present, and sent a message to the Duke of Richmond, then the head of the department. The warning was disregarded. The roof of"], [537, "811 ArrENDix. the Moorfields factory was blown off, London was alarmed, and Andrew Schalch was sent lor. lie fixed on AVoolwich as a safer site.\" Pago 301.\u2014 Money Values in the Seventeenth Century.

Marsh's test for arsenic still holds first rank. It is thus described by a writer in the Globe newspaper of August 10th, 1889 : \u2014 \"In all the tests an essential is that the chemicals and apparatus employed should be themselves first tested to prove the non-existence in them of arsenic. Marsh's test consists in placing together pure distilled water with some metallic zinc and pure sulphuric acid in a bottle with three necks, so arranged that the gas, hydrogen, which conies ofi may bo lighted at a jet. If a cold piece of white porcelain be depressed into the lighted jet of issuing gas, and upon the surface of the porcelain no mark or discoloration appears, the contents of the bottle are free from all traces of arsenic, and the apparatus is ready for use. Through one of tho necks of the bottle is then pom-ed a few drops of the suspected fluid ; it may bo tho expressed juice of the kidneys or liver, a little of the bile or of tho stomach juice. Tho cold, clean surface of porcelain is once again depressed into the jet of gas, and the presence of the poison is indicated in the shape of a deposit. In the centre of this deposit on the porcelain is metallic-looking arsenic, around is a deposit of tho same mixed with white arsenic, and outside this again a ring of arsenious acid m octahedral crystals. This deposit is further proved to be the poison in question by its solubility in a solution of chloride of lime, which is then turned yellow by ammonium sulphide, after heinc evaporated. This, on the addition of strong nitric acid, is evaporated again, neutralised with ammonia, and when nitrate of silver is added, a brick-red colour is obtained, the arseniato of silver.\""], [538, "812 APPENDIX. Pago 341.\u2014 The Royal Gun Factories in 1841. Jehanger Nowrojee, an Indian who visited AVoolwich Arsenal in 1841, wrote a description of the place, in which he says : \u2014 The cannons are first east into moulds and then bored with machines, moved hy three horses ; these animals are so trained that they stop and go on by the ringing of a bell. It takes about four or five days to boro a large gun ; the process is extremely simple, and upon our remarking why a steam-engine was not used to propel the machinery we were told that the present plan is so perfect that eighty years have now elapsed since its adoption, and that during this long period it has not cost \u00a3100 to keep it in order. Notwithstand ing this an engine is to be erected very shortly. This was the first introduction of steam into the Royal Arsenal. Pago 350. \u2014 The Arsenal Middle Gates. The middle gateway in Plumstead Road, at first known as \"the lower gate,\" was formed in 1830, as indicated by a stone let into the wall on the eastern side of tho entrance. A hundred yards within is a tablet beside tho approach to the cartridge buildings, inscribed \u2014 W. iv. R. 1S32. Pago 361. \u2014 Convict News. In \"The Convict's Complaint,\" which is said to have been written on board tho hulks at AVoolwich in 1815, tho writer murmurs, not at his imprisonment, but at his vile associates : \u2014 Just was my sentence ; nor do I complain Of daily labour, or the galling- chain. Placed by the law beneath a gaoler's sway, His rule without a murmur I obey. But that I should from fellow-prisoners bear Insult or blow or in their vices share, That I should do their will or dread their ire, Nor law hath said nor justice doth require. When evening o'er the ship her shadow throws AA^ith aching heart I hear the hatches close ; On the same deck confined, a various crew Employment various as their choice pursue. No keeper nigh, their conduct to behold, Eree are their words \u2014 their actions uncontroll'd. Here works are carried on of lawful trade ; Here implements of vice and fraud are made ; The coiner's hammer sounds upon the ear And picklock keys are manufactured here. Here sleepless gamblers pass in play the night, Dispute for petty stakes, and swear, and fight. Here arts of fraud are taught ; here leagues are made Of blackest guilt and plans of mischief laid. The young offender with amazement hears The sins and outrages of riper years, But soon familiar grows with every crime \u2014 A veteran hi vice while in his prime. Let justice rather strike her victim dead Than send him here the path of sin to tread ! 'Twere better doom him to the lion's den Than to this curs' t abode of wicked men !

On tho subject of pensions it should be mentioned that in 1889, a commission of enquiry was obtained, by the persistent demand of Colonel Hughes, M.P., and the circumstances under which pensions were abolished at the Royal Arsenal in 1862 wore investigated, with the result that all the workmen who joined prior to 1871 were declared to be entitled to superannuation.

A correspondent of Notes and Queries states that on August lst, 1814, there were festivities in the parks and the miniature representation of a sea-fight on the Serpentine in honour of the Allied Sovereigns. The ships were the long-boats and jolly-boats of men-of-war, brought up from Woolwich, and rigged as ships, and some dozen lads were placed in each with pistols and toy-guns. In the Green Park a fortress was besieged, and there was a wooden pagoda and bridge across the canal in St. James's Park. The pagoda was accidentally burnt. Page 420. \u2014 Royal Reviews. The jubilee of George III. in 1811 was celebrated at Woolwich with especial marks of loyalty. A salute of 50 guns at sunrise announced that the festival had begun. Divine service took place during the morning, and the whole garrison attended. Handel's \" Coronation Anthem \" was played by the band of the Royal Artillery with very fine effect, and afterwards \" God save the King \" was sung in full chorus. At one o'clock the whole of the troops were under arms, amounting to about 2,500 men; a salute of fifty guns was fired from the front, the line presenting arms, and, after giving three cheers, the whole marched past tho commandant. The officers dined together. The time of drinking His Majesty's health was noticed by another salute of 50 guns, and by the discharge of an immense number of very fine rockets, sent up into the air by fifties, which had a happy and pleasing effect. The day went off with that harmony and conviviality with which such a remarkable epoch should be celebrated. A liberal subscription was entered into by the officers for the relief of the widows, wives, and families of soldiers belonging to the corps, to which Lord Eardley added 100 guineas. A ball was given the following evening by the officers to the families in the neighbourhood. All the ladies wore an elegant scarf, with \"Long live the King \" in gold or silver embroidery.

The Royal Horse Artillery Band was the first mounted band in the regiment, having been raised and trained by Mr. James Browne, formerly a member of the Royal Artillery Band.

There is a disease of language as there are other diseases, and some demented words survive like the idiots who have no sense. So in this case : cadets became \"cats \" by orthographical abbreviation, and from cat to puss is less than a step. Hence \" pussy.\" Page 453. \u2014 Guest: Quist. For \"Colonel C. A.

Such was the good conduct and high state of discipline maintained by tho Regiment that the commandant at Woolwich specially requested that the East Kent Militia might bo again stationed there on return from Malta ; and the regiment was quartered at Woolwich for the second time from November 16th, 1857, to June 15th, 1858.

The minute books of the Watermen's Company show that tho watermen of Woolwich were greatly dissatisfied with the monopoly given to the western ferry by the act of 1811 and the amending act of 1815. The position was stated to be half a mile from the town, and its promoters asserted that it did no prejudice to the inhabitants or watermen, but as a penalty of forty shillings was levied upon every one who should within half a mile of it carry over any person, carriage, beast or chattel, the watermen petitioned for a repeal of the act, and in 1816 this was accomplished. The proprietors of this ferry paid to the Lord Mayor's Court a bonus of \u00a310, and a rent of \u00a3o a year while it lasted. Page 476. \u2014 Ham Creek, North Woolwich.

In the other, dated January 20th, 1200, Alexander Fitz Osbert acknowledges one knight's fee in Plumstead to Roger Percesvil. Page 4S7. \u2014 The Name of Plumstead. In a state paper of 1658 mention is made of a certain Henry Hurst of \"Plum Street, AVoolwich,\" evidently referring to Plumstead. Mr. W. G. Dawson says : \u2014 I give you my idea as to the origin of the name of Plumstead. In the olden days all this district was a shooting one, and, being marshes, large quantities of wild duck, &c, would be found here. Flump means \"a quantity,\" generally of wild fowl. Stead means \"home.\" I take it therefore that Plumstead or Plumpstead may mean \"the home of the wild fowl,\" which no doubt was true in the olden days. Mr. P. Z. Pounds makes the following observations relative to the origin of the name of Plumstead : \u2014 There is no express mention of the abbot in King Edgar's grant (see page 489), which is printed in Kcmble's Codex Diploma iicus, vol. iii., p. Sd. He grauts \"to Saint Augus-"], [543, "817 APPENDIX. tine, Apostle of the English, and to the brethren abiding in that holy convent, the land of four ploughs, which is called Plumsted, .\" It is very doubtful whether the first syllable of the name has anything at all to do with the adjective plum, plumb, or plump,\" meaning originally \" firm \" or \" hard \"\u2014literally \" swollen,\"\u2014 for the form of this word seems to he of a later date. .See Skeat, Etymological Dictionary, concerning plump. It may also be remarked that^itm, meaning the fruit, is good old Anglo-Saxon, plum-feder being \"plume-feather,\" and plum-sla \"plum-sloe\" in Bosworth's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. Page 488.\u2014 Hops at Plumstead. Several correspondents tell me that \" the fickle hop \" still flourishes in various gardens in and near Plumstead, and I have seen luxuriant bines richly festooned with blossom. But isolated successes in special situations do not disprove the general argument that Plumstead is not adapted for the commercial cultivation of the hop ; occasional exceptions only justify the reproach of \" fickleness.\" Page 489. \u2014 Plumstead. Old Church. I am glad to be informed that the Roman stone in Plumstead Churchyard and the gravestone here described are distinct, and that the latter is still in the church. The inscription upon it is said to com memorate one Ludovico, a Saxon Christian. Upon the same authority I learn that the \" Roman coffin \" was dug up in the churchyard, and was for many years employed as a horse trough at the Plume of Feathers, but was ultimately broken up. The cross upon the lid is almost certain evidence of a Christian interment. \u2014 Letter in Kentish Mercury, November 2nd, 1889.

Mr. Froude says that in the reign of Henry VIII. a penny would buy as much beef, bread, beer, or wine, or could do as much towards finding a lodging, as a shilling will do in the nineteenth century. An act of Parliament was passed in the sixth year of that reign providing that employers of carpenters, masons, bricklayers, and other skilled workmen should pay each man sixpence per day for half the year, and fivepence per day for the remaining half. Labourers were to have fourpence and threepence. Farms of a size to give employment for half-a-dozen men were rented at \u00a33 a year. \"When, therefore, we speak of a penny in the sixteenth century we must think of a shilling of our currency, and a noble of 7s. 6d. should be estimated at something like \u00a34 10s.

Mr. Bounds says : \u2014 It is somewhat doubtful whether lu',s is really Anglo-Saxon. But in any case its meaning is not ox or cow, but stall or crib. The Latin bos (\"ox,\" \" bullock,\" \" cow \") has probably led to some confusion, but it is singular, as stated by Halliwell and others, that borse should be the Hamp shire description of a six months' calf. Page 543. \u2014 Burghesh, Burwash, Burrage. The Earl of Abergavenny, who is closely associated with the county of Kent, is, like the Earls of Westmorland, in the direct line from the Barons of Burghesh. The first of them, described as \"Baron Bobert de Burgersh,\" derived his title from \"Burghersh,\" afterwards called \" Burwash,\" near Hastings, in Sussex, being summoned thereby to Parlia ment in the thirty-second year of Edward I. (a.d. 1304), as a Baron of the realm. He was the father of Stephen, who was the father of Bartholomew de Burghesh, the owner of the Burrage Estate at Plumstead. Bartholomew de Burghesh was knighted at Caeiiaverock. It is asserted that his grand-daughter Maud married Thomas, son of Geoffry Chaucer, the poet. Page 544. \u2014 Martin.

Mr. AA'alpole and others have conjectured that the present high level of the churchyard, the surface of which is several feet above the church floor, is due to successive interments of the dead extending over a period of many centuries. This theory will not bear investigaticn, and is most improbable. Finding the same peculiarity in the churchyards at Erith and other places which are situated near to the water's edge, I prefer to believe that tho ground in every such case has been puiposely raised as a barrier to protect the church from inundation. The dimensions of Plumstead Churchyard prior to its extension in 1860 are seen in Plate LXIL, Page 580. Page 570. \u2014 JIrs. Artfill. I am informed by Mr. W. E.

Page 604. \u2014 The Name of Erith. Mr. P. X. Rounds writes : \u2014 The earliest form of Erith seems to be Edrhith or Earhyth. Erenwald, bishop of the East Saxons (in a charter dated by Kemble a.d. 695), bestows on the nuns of Barking lands at Suanescamp [Swanscombe] and Earhyth given to him by King Aedilred and comprising xl cassat\u0153. [Cassata means a dwelling, along with land enough to feed a house hold.] This is given by Kemble, Codex Diplomatics, vol. i. p. 43, from MS. Cotton, Vesp. A. ix., and is the document referred to at p. 607 of the Records. The other docu ment in which the name occurs is that of which a paraphrase is given on pp. 606, 607 ; it is in Anglo-Saxon and in it the name is written Edrhith. In view of the discrepancy between the vowels we cannot derive car from \u0153rre, as has been suggested ; but there is an Anglo-Saxon word car, of extremely rare occurrence, meaning \" ground \" or \" earth,\" and this may possibly be the word wanted. The wicked man's name in this document is Leofsunu. Page 606.\u2014 Erith Church. Mr. P. W. Cradock is of opinion that Erith Church was built in the time of King Stephen, upon older foundations. Many traces of Norman architecture \u2014 an aumbry, piscina, rood staircase, and an ancient stone coffin, with the wooden door and metal work, still exist. Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, who is buried here, is said to have died in the tenth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. AVeever, the famous antiquary, was rector in 1605. Page 615. \u2014 Hall Place, Bexley. Mr. W. F. Tritton, of Bexley Heath, writes :\u2014 Hall Place contains sixty rooms, and is supposed to have been a hunting box of Edward the Black Prince. One large room is hung with tapestry, representing scriptural subjects, the figures being life-size, and has a handsome ceiling. There is, or was, a subterranean passage said to connect the house with Bexley Old Church, which I when a boy have ventured to explore, but after a short distance found bricked up. The mansion at that time was used as a boarding school, one of our number being the present King ot Bonny in Africa. The schoolroom, of large dimensions, appears m your illustration, being the whole front of the house between the wings; it was no doubt formerly the great hall, having high oak panelling, largo bricked-up fireplace, and two heads of stags with antlers hanging on the walls. The house is now used as a private residence : no lack of room I should imagine. Pa\u00ab-e 623.\u2014 Hamlet of Welling.

Of these five are to be elected for five years \u2014 two by the Board of Guardians, two by the vestry, and one by the vicar and churchwardens. The other six are co-optative trustees appointed for seven years, namely \u2014 the Rev. J. M. Beynon, vicar ; Messrs. George Brown, William Hardige, John Turtle, Robert Williams, and Charles Edward Moreton. A system of pensions is established for the benefit of parishioners who have lived in tho parish for at least three years without poor relief (this condition not to take effect for five years), preference being given to those who have been reduced from better circumstances. The amount of the pension is to be not less than six shillings aud not more than eight shillings per week, and the number of pensioners cannot exceed five. All that remains of the charity can be voted by the trustees to hospitals, provident and clothing clubs, sick nursing, emigration, and some other stipulated objects. Page 629. \u2014 The Roman Road. The spot at which C\u00e6sar crossed the Thames is oven more uncertain than his landing-place, which several writers claim to have been on the Sussex coast, although the balance of testimony seems certainly to favour the traditionary preference for Deal. It must be confessed, however, that if C\u00e6sar landed at Dungeness or Hastings his inland march would probably have led him to the Thames many miles above the Old Dover Eoad\u2014 perhaps through Dorking and the valley of the Mole to Kingston, which would coincide with the legendary crossing at Coway Stakes. C\u00e6sar says that he found the Thames fordable in one place only, and that his infantry crossed with only their heads above water ; also that a great number of the enemy were seen on the opposite bank, which was fortified with stakes. But prior to the embankment, the Thames was probably fordable at low tide even at AVoolwich, and still more probably at Blackwall, where the bend slackens the stream. It seems incredible that, when there were no locks, the Thames was fordable \" at one place only\" so far up as Kingston and Walton. The stream would have been passable anywhere. It is more probable that tbe spot which the invader found so exceptionably favourable was on the line of his advance from his landing-place. If we believe, as we have warrant for believing, that the landing was at Deal, then we may well suppose that he forded the Thames from the Charlton or Greenwich marshes. Page 633. \u2014 Cox's Mount. The only vestige of the telegraph station on Cox's Mount, now part of the recreation ground on the north-east borders of Charlton, is the trench of the foundations, showing the line of the brick-wall which faced .Shooters' Hill, and was painted with gigantic numerals, reversed for the telescope. Page 613. \u2014 A Cemetery proposed on Shooters' Hill. In 1S47 a proposal was advertised by which a cemetery was to be established on Shooters' Hill in the name of \"The Shooters' Hill Necropolis and United Service Mausoleum.\" It was to have occupied the sito of Severndroog Castle, and to have been raised in a series of terraces, which would have afforded space for ten thousand catacombs. Page 645. \u2014 Shooters' Hill Wood. The new road on the eastern slope of Shooters' Hill was commenced in July, 1739, and a great many hands were employed upon the work, so that it was speedily accomplished. The wood was unfenced and open and extended from top to bottom of the hill both right and left. A writer of the period (\" Tour through Great Britain \") sajrs : \u2014 \"Here they make those faggots which the woodmongers call ostrey-wood, and in par ticular those small light bavins which are used in taverns in London to light their faggots, and are called in the taverns a ' brush,' and by the woodmen ' pimps.' It is incredible what vast quantities of these are laid up at AA*\"oolwieh, Erith, and Dartford; but since the taverns in London are come to make coal fires in the upper rooms the trade declines, and, though the article would seem to be trifling in itself, it is not immaterial to observe what an alteration it makes in the value of those woods in Kent, and how many more of them than usual are yearly grubbed up and the land made fit for the plough.\""], [547, "821 APPENDIX.

Mr. Stuart Roupell says : \u2014 The story of Dick Turpin at Charlton corresponds in many particulars with the account I received from my mother, who hved in her girlhood at Cherry-tree House (so called from an old and large cherry-tree which grew in front of it). Her bebef was that Turpin robbed that house and that ho was alone, fastening his horse to the gate and surprising the farmer's family at dinner. The two narratives may relate to separate trans actions, but probably they are the same story. Page 652. \u2014 Highwaymen at Shooters' Hill. \" Shooters' Hill,\" writes Mr. Stuart Eoupell, \" had not lost its favour with the highwaymen and footpads when I was a small boy, in 1813 or 1814. I remember seeing my mother and sisters going off to a ball at Danson (vide page 625), when they were obligod to have four horses to their carriage on account of the badness of the road, and two men, as guards, in the rumble, who came into the hall before starting to examine the priming of their huge pistols and to see that their flints were in good order. AVe were glad to see them back next morning unmolested.\" Page 656. \u2014 Henry Coxwell. The famous \u00e6ronaut, Henry Coxwell, tells us in his biography that he resided in his youth at Eltham, his eldest brother being on board a ship at AA\"*oolwich. It was near Shooters' Hill that he had his first balloon adven ture. He says : \u2014 \" A school was selected for myself and second brother in the vicinity of Woolwich Com mon, where young gentlemen were prepared for the Military College. I was walking out one evening, when an object emerged from the clouds and was rapidly descending. I per ceived a grapnel at the end of a rope, and knew all about it in a moment. Here was a chance of witnessing a descent. My heart leaped with joy, and I stood still until I had made out the balloon's course. That being settled, I struck out like a hunter over hedges and ditches, and came in at the death before the gas had been exhausted. It was Mr. Green's balloon ! \" Mr. Coxwell in after life made four ascents a week from North Woolwich Gar dens, a peculiarity of these occasions being the passage across the river of the inflated balloon, which was towed from the gasworks to the gardens by a steam-tug.

In 1753 it was said of Charlton House by the writer of \" A Tour through Great Britain '' \u2014 \" The Court before the House is spacious, at the entrance of which are two large Gothic Piers to the Gates, and in a Line on the Outside of the Wall is a long Row of Cypress trees, which are some of the oldest in England. The House is now in the Possession of the Earl of Egmont.\" Page 687. \u2014The Roupell Estate. The author of \"A Tour through Great Britain \" (1753) says : \u2014 \u25a0 \" Near the Church are Two fine Houses, one of which was built by the late Lord Romney, who married a Daughter of Sir Cloudesley Shovel ; the other was in possession of the late Governor Hunter before he went to Jamaica. These Houses stand on the edge of the Hill, having their Gardens sloping down towards the River, which, though it renders the Pros pect to the River very delightful in the Heat of Summer, yet, as it exposes their Gardens to the North AVinds, their Fruit-trees are generally blighted; and in the Spring, when the AAlnd usually blows from tho North and East, these Gardens are so much exposed to them that there are very few days during that Season that Persons can walk with any pleasure in them.\" The Eoupell estate is not confined to the ten or fifteen acres comprised in the ground held by Mr. Balfour, but extends to nearly three hundred acres at Charlton, and embraces a large part of Woolwich lying between the Royal Arsenal and the Dockyard. Page 689.\u2014 Chalk Pits. A traveller in 1750 remarks that\u2014 \"From Woolwich the whole shore is low and spread with marshes and unhealthy ground, except at some few places where the land bends inward and the chalk hills almost join the"], [548, "822 APPENDIX. river, and from thence the city of London, the adjacent counties, and even Holland and Flanders, are supplied with lime, or with chalk to make it. From these cliffs on the river side the rubbish of the chalk is bought and fetched away by lighters and hoys andcarried to all the ports and creeks of the opposite shores of Essex, and even to Suffolk and Norfolk, and sold there to the farmers to lay upon their land, which they do in prodigious quantities, and are glad to give from 2s.\" 6d. to 4s. a load for it, according to the distance.\" Page 698. \u2014 The Congreves. Mr. James Browne states that it was the elder Sir AVm. Congreve who lived and died at Charlton, and was made a baronet (not knighted) by the Prince Regent. He was eccentric, if not insane, during his later years and committed suicide in 1812. His son, Sir William Congreve, who invented the rocket, died under abject circumstances at Toulouse, in May, 1828. Tage 702. \u2014 The Bugle Horn, Charlton.

Page 716. \u2014 Morden College. \"A Tour through Great Britain by a Gentleman,\" written in 1753, describes Morden College as \"one of the most comfortable and elegant pieces of charity in England.\" The writer alludes to the fact that the merchant-pensioners originally wore gowns, but says that they had discontinued tho practice for some years. He also says : \u2014 ' ' The chapel within the College is neatly wainscotted and hath a costly altar-piece ; and it has a burying-place adjoining for the members ofthe College. The founder, according to his own desire, was buried in a vault under the communion-table of the chapel.\" Page 726.\u2014 Eltham Palace. Professor Greenhill informs me that it was to form the roof of the great hall in Windsor Castle that Wyattville proposed to carry off the roof of Eltham Palace, but finally a copy was made instead. Page 752. \u2014 Gun Cotton. I have been reminded that under exceptional circum stances gun cotton will explode witho.it detonation, as it did during a fire at Stow-"], [549, "823 APPENDIX. market. I well remember also being present at tho Home Office Magazine in Erith Marshes with half-a-dozen others when Sir Frederick Abel destroyed tho dynamite* taken from London Fenians, and as it was burning away, a quantity exploded so near to us that it blew off our hats ! In that case it was explained that a portion of the compound must have become confined in a crevice of tho earth and created a resistance equivalent to a violent blow. Page 757. \u2014 Explosions. Mr. William George Brown adds to tho chapter of explosions two of a minor character which he thinks should not be omitted, at each of which he was present. He says : \u2014 In October, 1868, at 6 p.m., as I was crossing the bridge to take charge for the night of the drying-house of the gun-cotton, situate in the marshes (opposite the buildings where girls were then employed making cases for snider cartridges) I met Burgess, who had just left the drying-house, and while I was speaking to him the blow took place. The girls were frantic, several fainted, and I had all my work to keep them from jumping into the canal \u2014 happily no one was hurt. Another serious affair occurred at the Home Office Magazine in the marshes at Abbey Wood in July, 1879. Mr. Dibblin, an inspector of police (McEIHgot), myself, two constables, and two of my workmen were there. Colonel Majendie had con demned about 2S lbs. of fulminate of mercury which had been seized on board a Hamburg steamer, and we were ordered to destroy it. I put the explosive into a large earthen pan and poured about six gallons of water upon it, and a man named Burke was ordered to pour half of the acid to the water. The mass soon began to effervesce and I begged all present to stand away, but the explosion occurred, blowing Dibblin at my feet punctureil in three hundred places. The inspector had his head split open and Burke was on fire; I was stunned, but, thank God, who has so mercifully preserved me in four explosions, I was uninjured. Dibblin obtained his pension, the inspector lingered for some months and died, and Burke lost the sight of one eye. After continuing in charge of explosives for a little time longer I was permitted to leave upon a pension of 14s. per week for life. Page 791-2. \u2014 Murder of Sergeant-Major Sheppard. The account given of the murder of Sergeant- Maj or Sheppard was taken from the first reports published in the London papers, but, like many first reports, they seem to have been inaccurate. The assassin's name was Willis, not Williams ; the weapon used was not a rifle, but a smooth-bore musket ; and Mrs. Sheppard did not die a pre mature death, but lived for many years, and died onty recently at Plumstead. She was for a time matron of the Cadets' Hospital, and two sons are now retired commissioned officers. * Dynamite, gun cotton, and many other explosives are of similar character. PRINTED JY 1. f. VIRTUE AND CO., LIMITED, CITY ROAD, LONDON."], [550, "POSTSCEIPT. Like twigs raked from the surface of a stream, these Records have been gathered together, and presented to a generous public ; but the stream flows on and the Records are unfinished. Such a work as this must be always incomplete, even though it be again and again renewed after long years, and I sever it here without any need to apologise for leaving it a fragment. There has been, doubtless, much omitted which ought to have been included in the historical remains of the District, and I trust that the emergencies of space may be accepted as my excuse for all such shortcomings. If on the other hand, anything has been inserted in these pages which were better eliminated, I have only to ask forgiveness for unpremeditated sin. I have a heavy, an impossible, task in attempting to express the grati tude I feel for the support which has been accorded to me throughout my labours. To all the many who assisted me in the collection, compilation and cor rection of these Records, I can only say that but for them my work would probably have been never attempted, and certainly never accom plished. If I could I would name every friendly act which has helped me on and encouraged me, but time and space forbid. Here and there in the text or the Appendix, the reader may meet with references to names which are revered and honoured in my breast by untold kindnesses, but to render individual thanks to all my sympathisers and collaborateurs is more than I can perform. They are doubtless satisfied in seeing the fruits of their disinterested service in the book which they have helped to create, and I will say no more than that I shall hold them in affec tionate remembrance so long as I have life. For the liberal support which my neighbours and the general public have given me in the publication of the work, my deep and earnest obligations must also be expressed. Although the costly character of the production and the necessarily limited circulation rendered any hope of a profitable issue out of the question, I have been amply rewarded by a host of intelligent subscribers far beyond my expecta tion; and, in tendering them my thanks for the cordiality with which they have supported me from beginning to end, my only regret is that I have not been able to give them a better return. Hoping, in conclusion, that I have been enabled to supply some slight information concerning the District, and succeeded to some extent in my design of quickening the interest of the people in the scenes which surround them, I now take leave of my readers with a heart full of gratitude.
