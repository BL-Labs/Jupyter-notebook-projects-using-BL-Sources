It dips here and there hito a cutting, and then ascends again slowly to the top of a gentle hill.

But if you are looking the other Avay, you will see nothing of Shel bourne, except the chimneys of the red inn AA*hich stands some way out of the village, at three cross roads, and from whieh you have to turn sharp round to the left if you want to find Shelbourne. The monotony of the long chalk road is broken here and there by an elm wood, that comes down to the roadside, or by a sheet of hyacinths, lying like a blue bay in the heart of the wood. And earher in the year the copses are carpeted with primroses and violets, and the little children of Shelbourne, with hot hands and dirty \\vhite thread, come to pick them and tie them up and carry them home to their mothers, or to Mrs. Myse, or \"the minister.\" Aaron Falk and his boy Ben Brewer often see them, as they pass along in the >"], [13, "AARON FALK. 3 gig from Hepreth market on Tuesdays. But it is somehow in keeping with the laziness and stillness of this evening- that there should be no children in the copses : and that the only sound that breaks the stillness should be the lazy rolling of the gig wheels up the hills that billow this part of the way, and the far-off cawing of building rooks, at a farm half a mile distant. Aaron Falk is in the gig, holding the reins loosely ; Bess, the mare, is taking her time, going from side to side to make the little hill less ; and Ben, the boy, is walking aloncr whistlinos behind his master, and flickina- the heads oft* the \"lords and ladies\" with his whip. There is one other living\" thing in the still picture. At the top of a rising mound to which the hyacinths have climbed, a girl's figure is moving among them. She is gathering the hyacinths in lapfulls and putting them in her apron. 1\u20142"], [14, "JONATHAN. 4 \" I warrant she thinks she's gleaning,\" said Ben from the road, looking up at her. The girl, hearing the sound of wheels, turned round, and followed them with her eyes. Ben shook his whip at her. Then Mr. Falk drew up, and told him to get in, for they were at the top of the hill. And Bess, the mare, struck into a brisk trot, which she kept up till they had turned the corner by the Blue Dragon, and were close to the school. And the o'irl anion<_; the hyacinths watched them tdl they were out of sight. \"Take this to Mr. Byles,\" said Aaron Falk to Ben, stopping at the schoolmaster's gate. \" I've not forgotten it, you see, Mr. Byles,\" said he from the gig, as that person appeared at his door, and leant agamst the post at the entrance."], [15, "AARON FALK. 5 He Avas a shambling cadaverous man, AA*ith lanky legs upon Avhich the trousers of tAvo Mr. Byles seemed to be hanging \u2022 his chest was about a foot across, his cheeks fallen in, his jaw and temple bones pro truding, his colour mottled, and a look of the most extreme despondency that was not imnatural rested on his face, and showed itself even in his limbs. On this warm May evening he was AATapped round the throat with a red com forter, from which only his large blue ears and his melancholy face appeared. He held his hand pressed tenderly upon his person, as he ansAvered Mr. Falk in broken sentences. \" I am sure I thank you, Mr. Falk, sir, \u2014 very kindly. It is a real char \u2014 ity, sir, to such as me.

There could hardly be a greater contrast than the Avell-to-do good-looking brewer, and his melancholy dyspeptic friend. And yet in a way they Avere friends.

Joe can put up the mare.\" Ben, Avith a large parcel, got down obe diently. Mr. Falk turned through a green gate that Ben had opened and drove up a trim little avenue to his oavii door. A neat elderly servant-Avoman was there to receive him : Joe, the horsekeeper, touching his hat, was at the horse's head in a moment. \"The fish, sir?\" said Sarah. \"I hope you remembered the fish for your dinner.\" \" Fish ! yes. You'll find it in the gig.\" Aaron Falk kicked off his boots and threAv himself into the arm-chair to read the Hepreth Chronicle.

He was a very good boy, Ben ; the one son of his mother, he had no cares and no regrets, and he was always well fed, well clothed, and well housed : the latter, because \" he was only one, instead of bein' a dozen,\" as his father used to say ; so there was room for them to live decently,"], [21, "SHELBOURNE PLACE. 11 as feAv of the other folk could, in over croAvded Shelbourne and the neighbouring parishes. It spoke much \u2014 but was it good or ill ? \u2014 of the condition of the people, that they should be content to stay and overcrowd Shelbourne. There was a proprietor, who never lived there : the OAvner of three good houses, and as many fine estates, it was no wonder he did not care for the old \" Place \" at Shelbourne. To the artist it had some beauties : its fine old trees, its once lovely garden, the quiet httle pond at the large gate where the cattle stand whisking their tails through long summer afternoons, and Avhere the swans (that Aaron Falk has given to Mrs. Myse, and that he feeds, because Mr. May cannot afford to keep them,) go diving for fish in the clear water among the bright green weed : the little trout stream that runs along in its clear gravel bed, from the other side ofthe viUage,"], [22, "JONATHAN. 12 feeding the pond, and running through under the arched stone bridge to turn a mill and wash clothes for the villagers on the other side : all these are pretty, and SAveet to see, but it is not enough for some people. Yet, after all, the squire has per haps done better with bis house than to live in it : for he has given it to Mr. May, the curate, who lives there with his aunt, Mrs. Myse. Shelbourne is one of those parishes, for tunately now few, but still too many, that, being in the hands of college consciences, fares badly, and stands still, Avhile all the rest of the world goes on. The great tithes of Shelbourne are four or five hundred a year : the glebe is let : there is no vicarage. The preferment is refused by each felloAv, until the feeblest and most despairing, Avhoever he may be, seizes the straAV and accepts it. A hundred and fifty pounds a year and no house is not a tempting bait,"], [23, "SHELBOURNE PLACE. 13 still less is it so Avhen a man is in ill health, and when doctors and raihvays are alike far off. But out of the hundred and fifty pounds, the neAv vicar may employ a curate to do his work, and pocket fifty or sixty pounds a year. This curate is Mr. May : and through Mr. Falk's intervention, and because the squire has someAvhere a kind corner in his heart, the big empty unfur nished \" Shelbourne Place \" is put at his disposal. The httle bridge over the pond is the beginning of the approach to the house. It curves round through fields, one sloping down to the water, the other, studded with large elms, losing itself in shrubbery to the left of the house. At this part of the grounds, left to itself and nature like all the rest, such a sea of daffodds comes up in spring that it looks like a little forest : and here the village children are allowed to come and pick them on Saturday afternoons."], [24, "JONATHAN. 14 Ben goes along the moss-grown approach and rings the front-door bell. It has become the custom for people to go to the front door Avhatever their errand may be, because Mrs. Myse generally opens it herself. And they don't hke the idea of a lady, \" let alone Mrs. Myse,\" coming to the back door. The baker and the butcher alone driA*e round to the back. \"It 'ud never do for strangers to see per- A*isions goin' in at the front,\" they agree : though strangers are as rare as comets at Shelbourne Place. \" And though she's as 'umble as 'umble, it ain't for us to be a umblin' of her more, and a 'arrogating from her position, like.\" So the butcher in his bright blue smock, and the baker in his Avhite hat, vie with each other in gallantry to Mrs. Myse.

But it was also true that Jael, the poor charwoman, would not touch more food than she could go without, in the house where she knew poverty had set its seal. \" And a big house don't go to fill ye,\" she would say, \" no more than a thatched roof.

Certainly it meant more than the little soft child-sigh of pretty Priscilla, that said nothing more than \" it is bed-time,\" if it said as much. Jael had a history : that sad history that belongs to so many women of her class. She had been loved, as she thought ; plain, ungainly, and free-spoken as she Avas, some one had been found to loA'e her : at least he said he loved her, and Jael, avIio was true, beheved him.

He made some sort of sound, but it did not reach the dull ears of his Avife. She was used to it. She only rubbed her spectacles Avith the corner of her apron, snuffed the candle, and dreAv it a little nearer, blinked a little at the bright light, then sighed, and went on patching at her son's jacket.
