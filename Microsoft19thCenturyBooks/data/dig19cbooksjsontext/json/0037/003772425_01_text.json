It has been found that a romanc is most interesting to the public generally, when it is interspersed with a certain quantity of national history just enough to give it the character of usefulness**) extrinsically of any merit which may be due to an Author for the perspicuity with which his work is written. The knowledge of this circumstance has induced the Author of the \"Orange Girl of Venice,\" to choose, from the Tast quantity of materials before him, a sketch from that, till lately mal-governed country, Italy ; and he assures his readers that the anuses practised there were greater, rather than less, than he has described them in the volume now before them. That the Author has been successful in the present production cannot be doubted, if he take as a criterion the unusual demand which has been created for it, for which he begs to thank his patrons. To those who may not already have read the work, the Pub lisher confidently commends it to their notice, having no doubt that they will feel amply compensated for the time spent in its perusal. London, October, 1847."], [10, ""], [11, "CHAPTER I. THE STUDENT. In alow vaulted chamber, in the upper story of a humble building, situated in a disreputable section of the fai-famed queen of the Adriatic, sat a youth of some three and twenty years. A low, broad, cross-legged table was before'him , on wbich, in careless disorder, some ten or twenty volumes, bound in parchment, and ornamented with metal clasps, were scattered. Sheets of unstained parchment lay here and there, while directly before him was a sheet half filled with annota- No. 1."], [12, "HE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. tions-{ dates, &c,, apparently) for reference. A saucer of brass, containing a'dark iquid, restsd within a feu inches of the spotted parchment, *hile a long grey quill, cut at the tip, and stained with writing fluid, lay on the edge ofthe table, as if just put down. Tlio youth leaned lack ward ill his low-seated but high-backed chair, his right l'.and supporting his pale, high brow, while his left hung listlessly over he cioss -piece of his chair. The features of the youth were more of the feminine hen fcf the masculine cast, the forehead being high and pale, the eye dark .lustrous yet soft and meltinz, the cheek pale, the eye arching, the nose small, and with but h slight show of nostrils ; the lip slight ; and the chin small but pointed. He wore a small, silky mustache, and a slight pointed tuft adorned his chin. His hair was dark and redundant, and fell in long, wavy curls on his narrow shoulders. He wore a tunic of ordinary grev cloth, square at the neck, and bordered with daik velvet. His pantaloons, fitting tightly to the skin, were of a blue colour, but somewhat faded by cbnstant use. His shoes were ofa russet hue, and ornamented with rosettes of the same colour. The apartment was small, containing one window only, through which the moon light entered, and fell upon a low, rude couch in a corner, which gave evidence of the lateness ofthe hour when its master rose. Hanging on a peg, over the couch was a cross-hilted sword, sheathed in a scabbard of bright vellow metal, while a, belto' dark velvet ban\" down its side. A slouched cap of grey stuff, with a full, jetty plume, hung against the wali, a short distance from the sword, while a mantle of dark cloth rested beside it. The rest of the apartment was chillingly bare. The student appealed rapt in meditation, his eye falling vacantly upon thc parchment before birti. A small three-uornered iamp burnt dimly beside the saucer, giving u his countenance the appearance of cue oveiwoiked with mid night toil. A knock at his chamber door roused him fiom thought, and, in a deep stern voice, as he turned shghtly round in his chair, he bade the knocker enter. The door opened, and a tall, majestic person, enveloped in a mantle of dark and glossy velvet, of the finest texture, entered the apartment. A slouched cap, of the same material as his mantle, surmounted by a cluster of raven plumes, adorned his head. He wore mustachios, and his bold chin was hid beneath a thick, jetty beard. His eyes was large, black, and piercing as an eagle's; his forehead was high and massive, and there was an expression of sternness and re solution about his broad nostrils and firm upper lip, calculated to strike a be holder with awe. On perceiving the garb and rank of hi- visitor, the student sprang hastily from his seat, and offered it to the stranger. The latter took it in silence, and mo tioned the student to be also seated. \" Thou art called Calvari, the scribe, art thou not ?\" said the stranger. \" I am, my lord,\" replied the student, bowing in surprise. \" Thou dealest in ancient and modern lore, dost thou not ?\" \"A little, my lord.\" \" Canst translate me this ?\" said the stranger, drawing from his girdle a letter and handing it to ihe student. \" I will try, 111/ lord,\" replied the student, advancing towards the Iamp, and opening the parchment. The face of the student grew pale, as he glanced at the characters traced on the page. \" Thy cheek i lushes,\" observed the stranger, resting his sharp eye upon the student. \" Dothit.my lord .'\" said the stud- nt, falteringly. \" Ay, it doth. The meaning oft ?\" \" Take back the parchment, my lord.\" said the student, with increased agitation. \" I \u2014 I \u2014 dare not translate its language !\" \"Dare not!\" exclaimed the other, ironically. \"Whatfearest thou J\""], [13, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 3 \" Death !\" answered the student, holding the parchment towards the stranger. \" Ha ! is it so ?\" cried the latter, starting up, and seizing the document. \" Lies the wind that way?\" he added in irony, glancing with a curled lip and contemp tuous eye at the pale student. \" Go to, I took thee for a man !\" \" I am no coward, my lord !\" answered the student, in a deep, aud half re proachful tone, \" but 1 will not rashly throw away my life. The contents ot that document are not for my eyes : to read it were sealing my own doom.\" \" Wherefore ?\" \" 'Tis signed by the ' Ten,\"' was the reply \"By the 'Ten!'\" \" As I do live, my lord, 'tis true.\" \"Well?\" \" The usual warning, my lord, is given in the first part of it : ' Whoever dares to read this document, save he to whom it is directed, shall be visited by the ven gance of the ' Ten.' \" '\u2022 Ha I is it so ?\" exclaimed the stranger in a deep voice, \" is it so ? Then it is a sentence ! No matter \u2014 I must know its contents. Look you, sir,\" he continued, \"I'll give the choice of gold or instant death to resolve methetenour of this parchment.\" Saying which, the stranger flung the letter and a purse upon the table, and drawing a dagger from beneath his cloak, he pointed the student to the table. Calvari remained motionless. \"Wilt thou obey, or perish ?\" demanded the stranger, in a voice which made the chamber echo. \" Perish !\" answered the student boldly. The noble looked at him with apparent astonishment, then sheathing his dagger, he advanced towards the student, and in a voice in ill accordance with his words, exclaimed \u2014 \" Fool ! thou art only fit to mingle with the herd that 60 cravenly fear the ' Ten.' Thou hast a form and face that belie thy soul. I took thee for a man ; one who had suffered, still suffers, and had heart enough to dare a struggle for his freedom. But I mistook thee \u2014 thou ait a worm ! The 'Ten ' will rule thee, in sunlight and in darkness \u2014 at all limes, in all places \u2014 thou art only fit to be a slave ! Fear not me ; I would not stain my blade with blood like thine. But, sir, a word with thee. If thou would'st henceforth revel in gold, go thou to-morrow to St. Mark's ; seek the house of Count Foscari, and tell him, all potent as he is, there is another man in Venice, \u2014 one Count de Galliano, \u2014 who will overthrow him and the ' Ten.' Tell him this, and tell him too, that a plot is now afoot, to drive all tyrants from the soil of Venice, and that Count Galliano is at its head. Tell him, too, that we meet to-morrow night, in the vault of St. Mark's, and that eur watchword is, ' The Orange Girl of Venice,\" The student uttered a cry of recognition, Jand fell on his knees before the strangei. CHAPTER II. THE GONDOLIER. On the day following the incidents in the preceding chapter, a nobleman approached a group of gondoliers, who were rattling dice on a little round table, in front of a low hostel, which stood in a long, broad street, leading from the grand square of St Mark's, and fronting the sea. Small heaps of copper coin lay here and there upon the table; and it was evident, from the excited features. of the players that the stakes, to them, were of an unusually large amount. One tace of one ofthe party evinced but little symptoms of excitement, although, to the"], [14, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 4 dsep observing, there was more meaning, more real language, to be detected in his passionless features, than in those of his more frothy, and more talkative com panions. His eyes were large, dark, lustrous and full ; his forehead high, his hair thrown bai.k, and falling in careless disorder adown his swarthy, sunburnt neck ; his nose was Roman in its shape, with the nostrils wide and heavy, de lict oig the deep, fearless, and violent nature of their owner; his chin was bold, pom ted, and covered with a heavy tuft of black and glossy hair ; a heavy moustache covered his firm, upper lip, and his thick bull-like throat was exposed to the effects of the sun and atmosphere from the shoulders upward. He wore a loose, red shirt, with abroad, rumpled collar; thr sleeves rolled up to the elbow, revealing a pair of stout, muscular, sunburnt arms, which seemed to bid defiance to the best stalwart compeer in the struggle for gondolier or wrestling fame. Yellow shoes, blue trowsers, fitting tightly to the skin, a rough, short, canvass frock, j ust reaching to the knees, and a leathern belt, with an enormous steel buckle in the front, completed the gondolier's attire. His height was slightly above the common, and his figure, as he half stood by, and half sat on, the edge of the rude table, displayed a suppleness and muscularity of limbs not often found among the everyday tenants of this habitable house, the world. The garb of his companions was similar to that of the bold gondolier, with the exception that, in general, his habiliments seemed tidier and cleanlier than theirs. The master of the inn stood at the door, smoking his long, reed-like pipe, appa rently with great satisfaction. Ever and anon, he cast his eyes furtively upon thc gainesters, as if watching the progress of their games ; and, at each result ofthe \" last throw,\" a sickly, sarcastic smile would play around his mouth, revealing a set of teeth which seemed made to contrast in their whiteness with his dark aod swarthy complexion. Judging him by his appearance, he could not have been far from five-and-forty years of age. He wore an apron of coarse, dirty muslin, ar.d looked every inch the landlord of \" the inn of St. Mary's.\" A stout, ill favoured knave he seemed, and though while smoking, he paid, apparently, but little attention to the oaths and other exclamations of triumph or disappointment of those at the table, still a keen observer could easily have seen that not a word escaped his car, nor a gesture of the gondoliers his eye. As the noble approached, two or three of the gamesters threw down their dice, and, running towards him, proffered their services to row him out into the Lagoon, \" if it was the noble signior's pleasure.\" Passing them by unnoticed, the noble motioned the stout gondolier already de scribed, to jump into his boat. Tbe latter, with a respectful silence, sprang into bis gondola, which lay moored beside a small flight of land stairs, directly in front of die hostel. The noble followed slowly, and took his seat in the stern, with a dignity which impressed the group on shore with an awe they could scarcely banish, even when the fleet bark had rounded the quay. \" Lie to,\" said the noble, when the boat had reached the centre of the Lagoon. \" Dost thouknow me?\" \" 1 knew thee at the first,\" replied the gondolier, resting on his oars. \" How speeds the cause ?\" demanded the noble, in a low voice. \" Bravely, my lord ; the innkeeper, Marco, hath a daring and patriotic heart. He hath gold, too, and will loan it to the cause, without interest.\" \" Good ! and the rest ?\" \" They wear their dirks in their bosoms, 'twixt their flesh and shiits. Three hundred of them, as brave hearts as ever pulled oar or wielded knife, are ready to march at word of mine. When do we strike ?\" \" That will be determined to-night. I think 'twill be on carnival night ; though I speak without authority. The number of men we can surely count on ?\" \" Three hundred.\" \"And all determined V \" Every one, my lord.\" * Speak lower,\" and title me not,\" said the noble, leaning forward in his seat.

Therefore, lest our voices betray us, speak thou in whispers : the lagoon, though broad and deep, hath, ere now, been the doom of many a votary of its bosom. Remember the fate of De Gama, and title me not. The ' Ten' are everywhere.\" \"Were it not better I should row about?\" said the gondolier in a \"low tone. \"If we should be watched from the shore by any of the spirits of the tribunal \" \" Right,\" replied the noble, \" row on \u2014 but guide her farther from the shore.\" \" What success from abroad ?\" inquired the gondolier, slowly pulling out ward. \" None,\" responded the other ; \" we must depend upon ourselves. Physical help is hopeless ; although, in one shape, it is certain. I have raised twelve thou sand ducats, in sound yellow coin, from certain citizens in Rome, Verona, and Cyprus, which now lies in a corner of the vault of St. Mark's : it will be shown to night at our meeting.\" \" Gold may do much,\" observed the gondolier, meaningly. \" It will rouse the hearts of the desponding, if any be among us, when convened,\" said the noble, quickly ; \" for, to the vulgar mind, there is a power, yea, an eloquence, irresistible in a sack of shining dioss. But, be that as it may, we have a doom even for the weak-hearted.\" \"Aye \u2014 the cord and knife!\" observed the gondolier, with a slight curl of the lip. \" Bah ! 'tis too like the \" Ten.' \" \" Can they be dispensed with ?\" demanded the noble, quickly. \" They can,\" replied the gondolier, impetuously. \" How?\" said the noble, earnestly. \" By depending on the honour of all who choose not to proceed,\" responded the gondolier. \"Pshaw! you know not men !\" exclaimed the noble, hastily. \"When men league themselves together for a mighty work, there must be a fear held out to bind them to be true. Else doubts and fears as to the success of the enterprise would be the forerunners only to desertions and betrayal. Men are not all true, all brave j and the weak nerve must be held in check, must be kept true, by the known brave, and tbe known true beside them ; which latter failing, there mutt be a doom for apostates, which they must fear, to keep them true. For great ends, we must not scruple to employ small means. And what end, what enterprise more glorious than the freeing of one's country from a horde of villains tbat make all fear ! They scruple not to shed our blood, they scruple not to tear away from life, on most trivial and uncertain causes, too, those they deem dangerous to them selves or to their power \u2014 and should we risk our lives, the lives of all united with us, by sparing one who knowing all our secrets, would depart on dastardly excuse, and peril the safety of us all ? No ; once colleagued, we must not risk life \u2014 perpetual freedom, and life's life \u2014 not for one, but all \u2014 high and low, the wealthy and the low born : and such an acme were endangered, to spare a craven's life, for sake of mercy !\" \" I fear not betrayal,\" observed the gondolier, proudly. \"Nor I,\" replied the noble, \" while we have a dorm for traitors. But, enough of this. I called last night on our spy in the eastern section. Wouldst believe it \u2014he knew mo not.\" \"Ha! not know thee!\" exclaimed tbe gondolier, leaning forward on his oars. \" Has he turned traitor?\" \" In good faith ! not he,\" replied the noble, \" It was my beard and face, and dress he knew not,' \"By St. Mark! I feared something else!\" sa$ tbe gondolier, half 8{ni(ing- P Wb\u00ab*t number reports he ready for trial hour?*"], [16, "6 THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. \" Four hundred and twelve,\" answered the noble. \"Their names are registered on parchment. In truth, that same student is a brave worker ; his parchments contain the names of every member of our order, in characters as plain and bold as ever came from tbe- hand of man. Our constitution and our laws, our rewards and penalties \u2014 the progress of our order and its history \u2014 the causes of our existence \u2014 the wrongs we have suffered, the injuries forborne \u2014 in fine, our order's whole history \u2014 are traced in characters of truth upon his parchments. His daily journal keeps he ; of the proselytes made, wrongs suffered, the day and hour of the deed, and the names of the wronged and the wrougers. A terrible history of life lies in those parchments ; a terrible history of blood, lust, murder, and oppression, which cries aloud to Heaven for vengeance.\" \" Aud it will come, ere long i\" exclaimed the gondolier, with a savage smile. \" Aye, it will,\" cried the noble, in a deep tone, though without stirring a hair, \u2014 \" it will \u2014 aye, it shall ! \u2014 and when it does, woe, woe to the doers of dark deeds ! woe lo the tribunal I woe to the ' Ten !' \" \" Amen!' with all my heart !\" exclaimed the gondolier, slowly pulling his oars. \" Now, to what I would tell thee,\" added the noble, leaning forward a little, and resting his elbow on the rim of the boat. \"The old Count of Romagna has been missing these three days ; and his motherless daughter, the Lady Isabel, is all but mad in consequence. The count's friends speak of his absence with a pallid cheek and a faltering tongue. 'Tis evident that they suspect, and yet \u2014 the cravens ! \u2014 they dare not give utterance, with their tongues, to that which is seen so plainly in their eyes !\" ' \" Hast thou no suspicion of his fate?'' said the gondolier, earnestly. \" I have,\" replied the noble, drawing a small roll of parchment from his belt. ' The Lady Isabel herself did, but yesterday, put into my hands this note, traced in characters recognisable only by those familiar with the handwriting of the president of ihe infernal tribune. Listen : it runneth thus, \u2014 \" This day, Friday, the 9th, 4 of the dial. \" Thomaso Romagna, we summon thee to appear before us within the hour. (Signed) \" The Ten.\" The gondolier turned pale. \" Thou seest the necessity of action,\" said the noble, on perceiving the change in the countenance of his companion. \" Thou seest the manner in which we live > we, the rightful inheritors of our beloved Venice \u2014 we, the strong-armed and lion- hearted \u2014 we, the descendants ofthe fathers of the Adriatic's chosen isle \u2014 we, the favoured and the gifted of nature and of God ! Shall we endure it \u2014 shall we suffer these upstarts of power to trample upon the God -chartered rights of Venetians, and crush us at their will ? Shall we live on, in base and abject fear \u2014 shall we crawl, like worms, before these soulless heart-spotted lepers, till either nature, acci- dent, or tyranny, tears us from such mind and body vassalage ? Shall we endure to have the bravest and purest blood amongst us rifled from our midst, and not raise a hand to smite the murderers ? Forbid it, God of my fathers ! while there yet exists a son of Venice wise enough to detect, and brave enough to strike at, villany and her myrmidons !\" The gondolier pulled his oars lustily, fearing that the excited gestures, and bold loud voice of his companion would be observed by those on shore. \" Think'st thou he is dead ?'\" asked the gondolier, striving to tum the excite- ment of the noble back to its former cautious current. \" Think he is dead!\" exclaimed the count, in a lower tone. \" If I thought so if I thought there existed the slightest shadow of a hope that the old man was yet alive, all Venice should ring with the war-cry of Galliano! TMnk he is dead ' the summons of the victim of the ' Ten' is but another word for ' Thou art marked and doomed \u2014 come to thy death !' \" \"But the cause?\" inquired the gondolier, pale with terror at the loud voice of his companion, and rowing rapidly larther out from the shore. \" Foscari's sou!\" was the reply; \"Foscari's son,_that insolent, purse-prouc}"], [17, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 7 dastard, \u2014 proposed to the Lady Isabel to become his mistress !\u2014 Dost hear it, his mistress\u2014 she, the daughter of a race of nobles, old as Venice itself, and whose scutcheon had never known stain ! His mistress! his! aye, the mistiess of a mongrel heart, that never had courage enough to strike a whining dog ! His mistress! Ha! ha! ha! Oh, that I had been by, to have smote him for the word! He proposed, I say, in dastard speech, to Lady Isabel, and was ejected from the lord's house he had insulted. Stung with rage and mortification, he forged a lie, and told it to his father. In an hour, the black messenger of the tribunal summoned him before the \"Ten.\" He bowed, and seizing his hat and cloak, left the house, in company with the note bearer, without even taking leave of, or bidding adieu to, his daughter. While leaving the room, be dropped the summons, which the Lady Isabel picked up. She tried to read it, but the warn ing seutence was the first that met her eye, and though she kept, she did not dare to read it. But yesterday, she gave it to me\u2014 but yesterday, I saw her, like a lily which once had reared its head in towering pride, now bowed to the* earth with the shafts of sorrow and despair! She sits now, in her home, a motherless, father less girl ; with no friend nor brother to save her from the importunities and insults of the dastard, who robbed her of her father !\" The cheek of the gondolier crimsoned a moment, with rage and scorn; when the blood fell back into its channels again, leaving his features pale as marble. Dark and terrible were his thoughts ; and, though he grasped his oar, till the nails almost entered the wood, he spoke not. The noble felt conscious that he had touched a string in the breast of bis companion, which would not soon die away ; and, pointing silently to the shore, the gondola was soon back to the spot from which it started. As many were lounging about the door of the hotel, the noble sprung hastily from the boat, saying, in a low voice, as he passed the gondolier, \u2014 \" Remember to-night ! The vault of St. Mark's !\" CHAPTER III. THE PRIDE OF VENICE. It was a night of beauty and of music, in Venice. The vault of heaven seemed like an eternal canopy of darkest velvet, thickly gemmed with silver, and crowned with a ball of fire. The housetops, tbe balconies, tbe vestibules, the gardens, streets, and quays, were thronged with the young and old, of both sexes, drinking the evening ether. The moon-kissed waters were covered with fantastically arrayed gondolas, from which arose the ripe, rich voices of the gay young roysterers and ca valiers in melodious song : while from others the flute and guitar mingled their music with the floating zephyrs, rendering the whole a fairy scence. It was a night of harvest to those who loved the bright and beautiful ; it was a night of harvest to the maidens whose lovers had been coyish in naming the hour for betrothal before high Heaven ; it was a night of harvest to the aged and infirm, for their pains and rheums were dissipated by the mellowness and liveliness df the air ; it was the harvest night of gondoliers, and musicians, and drink venders; and it was the harvest night of the sorrowing ones ; the beauties of earth, air, and sky \u2014 the veriest beauties \u2014 made their sorrow lighter, their griefs less piognant, their woes less dark, less terrible ; it was a night when the grief-stricken could smile with out deeming it a sacrilege ; it was a night when foes thought kindlier of each other, and were half disposed to forget injuries past, and to look kindly on accidents of the future. Who has not seen such nights in the course of life's travel \u2014 but who"], [18, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 8 has ever si-en them in such perfection -js they were found in Venice in the merry month of June? On the night described, two young females, evidently of high rank, were walking up and down the gravelled walks of a private and beautifullv-finished garden, adorned with statues and a small fountain. They were dressed in darkest mourning, and without ornament of any kind. Their hands were linked together as they walked, and their voices were low as doves, when whispering the feelings rf their hearts. A wall of some ten feet guarded them from the intrusion and observation of those without ; when an old, white-headed servant, who sat on a cushioned bench on the porch of the house, attested at once the fearfulness and chariness of character of the females. The appearance of the elder \u2014 for there was evidently a discrepancy in their years \u2014 was that of a maiden of about twenty summeis. She was slightly above the common height of her sex, and had a full, high and beauti fully polished forehead ; her nose was Grecian, and the mould of her lips like unto a perfect bow ; her chin was slightly pointed, yet dimpled ; her eyes large, and black as night ; her hair, of which there was a profusion, was black and silky, and was parted tastefully in the centre of her brow, and hung in wavy masses adown her snowy neck. A narrow collar of the whi'est lace, hemmed the neck of her dark velvet frock, and gave to her figure a beautv which could scarcely be idealised by a painter. Her dress fitted tightly to her waist and arms, and her hands were hid by gloves of white kid. The costume of her companion was precisely the same ; but though the features and figure of the latter were smaller, less imposing, less striking, less beautiful, still they had in them something more winning something more pleasing, something more congenial to the humble soul. Her brow was of a moderate height, and its complexion was like that of one accustomed to wander in the sunlight, fearless of the effects of such exposure upon the skin ; her lips were small, her eyes moderately large, but full of lustre, full of love, full of gentleness, confidence, and kindness. Her chin was bold, but it was a softened boldness ; her neck was beautifully shaped and full, but it was of the shape that artists love to draw from, not the neck which creates passion in the sensualist. Her form was perfect in its proportions ; but it was one of those forms which strike the eye of the gentle heart, not the proud, the brave, the impassioned. It was a short, delicate form ; and one which seemed to tell the looker-on, 'hat it was a .-pirit-sojourner here, not a human one ; that it was a tender plant fomed bloom in the most carefully cultivated and most tenderly watched plats, not in the rough, wind-exposed spots, of God's green garden \u2014 earth. They were, evidently, no' sisters in kin, but it wis also evident that they were more than sisters in love. Perhaps suffering had made them such ; perhaps, trial ; but whatever the cause, though strangers in blood, they were, without question, sisters in heart. The old servant who sat on the porch kept his eyes upon them with a look of love and affection, which attested his anxiety for their welfare. And when any thing like a smile played around the lips of either, his own heart bounded and his own cheek3 were enlivened more cheerily than theirs. It was something worth looking after, we opine, or the old man Would not have watched so earnestly for a smile from either of the females. Whatever the subject of their discourse, it was dis\u00abipated by a servant, who entered from the house, stating that a gentleman would see the Lady Isabella. \" His name?\" demanded the elder of the ladies. \"He'll not reveal it, my lady,\" answered the servant. \" His age?\" inquired the lady. \"He is turned of sixty, lady,\" replied the servant. \" Say I will wait on him,\" responded the lady, majestically. The servant bowed and withdrew. \" Shall I remain here ?\" inquired the younger lady. \" Yes Eugenia,\" replied Isabel, with emotion, \" talk to aged Philippo, on the porch yonder though not an Adorns, he is yet a merry talker ; and, in good"], [19, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 9 truth, he can while an hour away as pleasantly as many a younger of [his make.\" Though the Lady Isabel spoke with an attempt at pleasantry, there was yet a sadness in her tone which touched the heart ot her companion, and brought a tear into her eye. They kissed each other, and the elder slowly entered the house. When the Lady Isabella entered the reception room, an old man, sitting on a high eushion near the window, and dressed in a gay and flashy suit illy becoming bis years, met her eye. A crafty and sinister expression played around his small thin lips, and sharp, ferret-like eyes. He wore a pointed beard, and musrachios, white as the driven snow,Jand both, to all appearance, cultivated with the ex tremest care. His eye-brows were white and sloping, which gave to his visual organs the appearance of having been set in without regard to taste, propriety, No. 2."], [20, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. or fashion. His forehead was low, but the absence of hair upon tho crown made it, at first view, appear lofty. He was dressed in a scarlet jacket and shoulder cloak, and trunks and hose of the finest and whitest silk. He wore slippers With white rosettes, and a long, slender rapier was slung around his waist, upon the hilt of which both his hands rested, as Isabel entered the apartment. \" Your pleasure, sir ?\" demanded the lady, sitting on a raised cushion, oppo site him. \" I have called on an errand, lady,\" said the stranger, \" which involves thy safety, and the lives of all thy kin. I would first ask if thou art aware of the existence of a young noble called Galliano ?'' \" I am,\" replied the lady, slightly blushing. J. \" I would further ask, lady,\" continued the old man, \" if thou hast seen him within three days?' \"Why these questions ?\" said the lady, turning slightly pale. \" 'Tis thine office to answer, not to question, lady,\" replied the old man, with a sarcastic smile, and rivetfing his bold and crafty eyes Upon the lady. \" What if I tthSWer not i\" inquired Isabel, proudly. \" Means Will be found to make thee answer, lady,\" responded the old man, smiling, and in a tone which made the young lftdy*9 heart sink with terror. \"There ate tneans for the performance of everything, lady,\" he continued in the same bitit)_;, sneering tone, \" and it will argue wisdom in thee not to provoke the engines of wrath. Thy father did, and thou now wearest sables for his impru dence.\" The cheek of Isabel new tamed ghastly white; her bosom panted with emotion, and a tear leapt into her eye ; but, after n silent but violent struggle, she forced it back, and, rising, approached the table, as if to ring a little bell, which stood upon it. The stranger, divining her intent, suddenly rose, caught her by the wrist, and exclaimed, in a low but biting tone, \u2014 \" Lady, be not in haste to call your servants, \u2014 I can leave your house without their aid. Besides this is not a question of politeness, but one of life and death. So, oblige me taking my blunt speech as it suits you, till I am done, Pray, be seated !\" And he led her, with scrupulous politeness back to her seat. \" The gallants of our sea-girt isle, call thee the Pride of Venice,\" continued the old man, seating himself opposite Isabel, and gazing at her with a cold and brazen eye. \" See what it is to be beautiful, lady, \u2014 see what it is to have an angel's stamp on human lineaments! Reflect what it is to have youth and hot blood and all the appetites for the luxuries and pleasures, invented by man to charm youth and the summer of life ! And ponder over the beauties and luxuries, generously accorded to all human kind by Nature, to make man, from his first to his second childhood, feel the enjoyments created for his sole benefit. Connect them with the luxuries conceived and perfected by man, and then feel the poignancy of the thought that human hands have doomed thee to taste no more of either \u2014 \u25a0 have doomed thee to the eternal sleep found only in the grave!\" Isabel spoke not ; though her cheeks blanched every moment paler, her eyes quailed not at the steady and brazen gaze of the man now before her, but her heart throbbed painfully rapid. \"What if thou wert doomed, lady ?\" continued the old man, in a tone indi cating, in spite of himself, his disappointment in not receiving any response to his observations. \" I \u2014 \" said Isabel, faintly, as a sickly pallor darted across her features. \" Ay, lady,\" added the old man, \"what if thou wert doomed t ' \" I'd meet it, like my father,\" replied Isabel, firmly. \" So thou say'st now,\" said the old man, with a quiet and cold smile ; ''but, if thou stood'st in a chamber whose walls were bare as thine own limbs of vesture, with the engines of death girding thee around, while the grim forms of scurvily elad and masked executioners stood waiting the signal of their master to rend thy bones asunder,\u2014 thy speech would falter as thy cheek now doth blanch !\" \" What is thy errand here ?\" demanded Isabel, in a low, deep voice."], [21, "THE ORANGE GICL OF VENICE. 11 \" Te warn thee beware a traitor,\" answered the old man, \"to warn thee cease all communication with one to whom thou givest too free licence with thine ear and lip. For shame on thee I that one so highly burn \u2014 an orphan, too ! \u2014 should think so lightly of her honour as to permit the free addresses of a known libertine and \u2014 \" \" Stop thy dastard tongue!'' exclaimed the Lady Isabel, starting up, and pointing the old man to the door, \u2014 \" whoe'er thou art \u2014 whate'er thine errand \u2014 I care not ! Begone.\" \" Lady, \" \" Not a word ! This house\u2014 this roof is mine \u2014 mine, by heritage and law \u2014 mine, by the legal codes of Venice \u2014 and, while beneath my own roof, no low born hind, nor creature of birth or power, shall assail mine ear with insolence, or bravado. Begone !\" The old man leaned upon bis cane, between her and the door, his feathered cap hanging in his left hand, and his eyes gloaming maliciously and sharplv at the fair speaker as she stood, stern, bold and erect, her finger pointing to the door. \" Lady, I am here for a purpose,\" said he, in a low, soft voice, and with a smile which was an index to his nature, \" I am here fora purpose, and till it be accomplished, thy threshold shall calmly await my inclination to cross it.\" \" What ho, Martino I\" exclaimed Isabel, loudly, and ringing a silver bell which rested on the circular table, \" what ho, Martino ! thy mistress needs thy help !\" The object of her wrath, smiling, quietly resumed his seat. A hurried step was heard in the entry \u2014 the door opened hastily, and a young servitor, of seven and twenty yeirs, entered the apartment. \" The matter, lady !\" he exclaimed, hurriedly and bowing. \" Turn yon hoary wretch from out of my doors !\" she cried, pointing to her visitor. The eyes of the servitor and the old man met \u2014 a hasty sign from the latter, un observed by the Lady Isabel, but which the sharp eye of the servitor detected, silenced the latter and caused his cheek to blanch to the hue of ashes. \" Leaves us,\" said the old man, in a calm and silvery tone. Without a word \u2014 without an upraised look \u2014 without a glance at his astonished mistress, the servitor bowed, and, his eyes resting upon the carpet, slowly retired from the apartment. Isabel looked after him in astonishment. \" Thou seest the enuines of thy house,\" observed the old man, sardonically, \" thou seest the faith of its small pillars I\" The Lady Isabel heeded him not, but clasped her hand to her forehead, staggered, pale aud ghastly, to a cushion, and sank upon it speechless. CHAPTER IV. The sun was playing through the casement when the Lady Isabel awoke, and the hum of voices mingled with the winds. She looked round. The door was closed ; and save herself, no human thing breathed in the chamber. The apart ment seemed smaller than usual, and the drapery around the walls seemed darker than on the preceding day. A large and heavy lock was on the door too ; and the door itself had changed its colour since yesternight. The entire aspect of the apartment seemed changed. A picture \u2014 a small one \u2014 hung between the windows which she could not recollect. She sprang up, and advanced towards it \u2014 she di ' not know it. Her brow felt heated \u2014 her eyes weak and nervous. She sat dow on a cushion, and tried to think \u2014 she could not. A short pain shot athwart h n brow, and scattered the loose leaves of her memory. She felt sick at heart, chil, e'"], [22, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 12 n soul, vacant in mind. A phantom seemed to dance before her \u2014 a dim and shadowy phantom \u2014 yet could she not give it shape ; for when her eyes gazed intently and boldly at it, it vanished, and the sunbeams were before her. She arose, and paced the chamber vacantly. Something heavy was on her heart \u2014 an iron weight upon her brow. Air! air! Her tongue was parched \u2014 her lips seemed glued together. \" Water \u2014 water !\" she muttered, unconsciously. She paused \u2014 her eyes rivetted upon a narrow slit in the carpeted floor. It gradually widened, till a square hole, of some four feet, revealed a dark vault beneath. She stood fixed, gazing into the depth, which appeared like the chasm of eternity. Presently, a slender and curiously carved wash-stand, with a snowy towel dangling at its side, rose, as if by some springy pressure, and, when its base had reached the carpet's edge, the wooden floor resumed its place, and the stand, surmounted by a circular basin of brass, filled with scented water, remained motionless. She gazed upon it half vacantly, a moment ; then plunged her band into the liquid and applied it to her brow. Memory seemed to return shadowingly with the first drop of the cooling liquid, and frantically seizing the towel and bathing it in the bowl, she applied it to her burning brow. A sob, a cry, burst from her parched lips, and she sank overpowered upon the floor. As if by magic, the stand immediately disappeared \u2014 the casements darkened, and a huge torch rose through an opening in the floor. The drapery on the wall opposite the windows was thrown aside, and a young and magnificently dressed cavalier entered and raised the inanimate lady in his arms. A smile hovered around his lips, as he gazed upon the fevered lip and ashy cheek of his burden. A smile \u2014 but it was not the smile of love nor guilt. Raising her in his strong arms, he silently and stealthily departed with his burthen, through the secret panel, behind the drapery. The torch still burned on. CHAPTER V. the kinsman's tale It was eventide j the stars shone dimly in the heavens, and the moon was pale The atmosphere after a warm and sultry day, was cool and pleasant, apd infused new strength into the feeble, and made the couch of the despairing invalid a couch of hope. It was one of those nights when the nervous mind feels settled, joyous, strong, and fearless; one of those nights when the timorous heart is sanguine of success, and fears not to make a venture ; one of those nights when the malig nant heart is so acted upon by the elements, that its dark conceptions centre on one spot, and that a bloody one \u2014 when it is in such a state that one kind word from its hated foe would change its venom into love ; one of those nights when the woe stricken and the trampled of God's mike half forget their wrongs, their injuries their sorrows, calamities, and woes, and feel cheerful, half joyous, more than re signed ; one of those nights, when, if ever, angels in heaven look down upon mortality with a hope and a smile ; one of those nights when earth has more laugh ing, joyous ones, and less weeping and groaning ones \u2014 one of those nights when the King of the eternities says to the recording angel, \" Cease thy recording labours \u2014 crime sleeps.\" Venetians of every grade promenaded the streets, squares, and quays. The tide was high, and almost on a level with the piers. The lagoons were covered with the richly caparisoned barges and gondolas of the nobility and higher classes of citizens ; while the humble gondolier, his bark freighted with young lovers, pulled his oars cheerily, as the ripe, rich voices of his passengers cbaunted their favourite"], [23, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 13 melodies. It was a night of univsrsal joy. Universal ? No, there were excep- tions. Despite tlie cool and delicious air\u2014 -despite the joy which seemed so universal there were two that night in Venice upon whose cheeks no joy. no smile, nor aught betokening mir h or happiness, could be detected. An old man, with locks snowy as the vesture of the highest Alps in winter, and clad in coarse, brown velvet trunks and a jacket of the same, sat on the edge of the Orfano canal, bathing his feet in the tide. Beside him, half-extended, his elbow resting on the earth, and his head supported by his broad, sinewy hand, was a young, stout, well-proportioned youth, of some four-and-twenty years, clad in the garb of a gondolier. ''What a beautiful night, Paulo!\" exclaimed the elder, glancing at his com- panion ; \" it half tempts one to forget his griefs, and think Venice a free land ! 'Tis a'shaine, boy, that thy barge was broken at the regatta on Monday last. It would have been money in thy pouch, to-night \u2014 for, look ! all Venice hath dis- gorged its living, and they float upon the lagoons like water-fish. The young maid leans upon her lover's arm, and, happy now, dreams that the future hath in it no more of joylessness. Umph ! she'll find her mistake out, ere the world hath done with her. Boy,\" he added, \" dost recollect thy sister? '' \" Ay, father,\" replied the other, sadly. \" Dost recollect her beauty, boy, her angelic smile, her heavenly eyes, her spirit- like form, her tiny feet, and lady-like hands, so small, so white ? We used to call her our ' little belle.' Throughout Venice she was called ' the pretty orange girl.' She used to sell her fruit on sunny days, in her little round basket, orna- mented with orange leaves. Everybody used to buy of her, she was so fair, and had such winning ways with her ! Dost remember her perfectly, boy ? \" \" Ay, father ay,\" replied the youth, in a deep guttural voice. \" And then her voice, too \u2014 so ripe, so rich, so mellow, that, when she pleased she could lull the sternest heart into the calmest, gentlest humoHr, and make it sad, or joyous, as she willed, Ah ! she was too fair, too beautiful for earth! \" A tear danced a moment on the lid of the old man's eye, then leaped upon his rough and hoary cheek. He brushed it off \u2014 a moment afterwards, and the snowy locks that covered his crown were not more pale than his tear-kissed cheek. \" 'Tis now three years since she was taken from us,\" continued the old man, as if speaking to himself, \"and yet no word, no trace of her ? Boy,\" he added sternly, \" had'st thou but the spirit, the fire, the bold blood that should mark thine age, thy father's spirit would, in ihe winter of its years, take its last look of Venice and of earth, with a smile ! \" \" What mean'st thou, father? \" cried the youth, starting up, with surprise. \" Wbat do I mean \u2014 what do I mean ? \" muttered the old man sarcastically, \"ay boy, what do I mean ? \" \" Speak out father,\" cried Paulo, earnestly. \"Foscari !\" said the old man, laconically. \"Well?\" \" He robbed thy sister of her honour, and yet lives.\" \" Remember his birth, father ! \" \"His birth?\" \"Ay, father, his birth\u2014 remember that.\" \" Too well, too well do I remember it,\" mutteied the old man, satirically. \" Too well do I remember it ; my heart is like a burning coal when I re member it.\" *' What would'st have me do, father ? \" \" Avenge her wrongs \u2014 hadst tbou the heart ! \" \"Have I it not, father?\" \" Thy conduct doth not show it, boy.\" \" The hour bath not yet come, father.\" \" Dost look for it, Paulo ? \" \"I watch for it, father.\" \" Watch for it! The brave heart and cunning mind make time, and for j revenge wait not for circumstance or accident. I'U tell thee a taje, boy. When I was"], [24, "14 THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. thine age, or near it, I loved thy mother. We were poor, both; we were young both ; we were comely, both. She had no superior in beauty among the haughties or lowliest, in Venice, of her sex. For her beauty's sake a young lord wooed her \u2014 wooed her, but wooed her not to wed her. He dazzled her eyes with his gold, rank, and promises. She was weak enough to believe that, she would disgrace his birth, pride, and rank, by wedding a lowly craftsman's daughter ; and therefore, though professin g much before to love me, discarded me. Knowing well thc motives of the noble's visits to her cottage, I confronted him one night upon the Rialto, as he was returning from her house, and charged him with his vile intents. He answered me with a look onlv \u2014 a look of supercilious scorn \u2014 and bade me stand out of his path. Persons were passing at the moment, and I obeyed him meekly. He passed on, with a loud, scornful laugh. My blood was up \u2014 but the hour had rot yet come. The moon was up, the stars were foith, in all their light and beauty \u2014 it was not the hour! Fearful of death, he did not venture to cross the Rialto again by night, for a week, when, conquering his timidity, he donned his plume and sword , ai.d cloak, and posted for her house. She had been expecting him, a nd was arrayed in her most glittering and showv attire. She looked beautiful, and knew it. She stood at the door anxiously awaiting bis arrival- The night was dark, and the streets and quavs were dimly lighted. Concealed behind the gate of an adjoining house, I heard every whisper that passed between them. She had pro mised to become his on the ensuing night. It was to be a secret marriage \u2014 to be kept concealed at first \u2014 then gradually broached to his family and hers. \" Thou understandest the meaning of such a marriage, Paulo. 1 heard it all \u2014 understood it all. My heart was rent with jealousy and rage, and yet I kept my post, till he quitted her to return home. Taking off my shoes, so that my foot falls should not alarm his ear, I stealthily followed him, till he had arrived within ten paces of the Rialto. Then drawing my knife, I rushed upon bim, and the blade had thrice entered his heart ere he could recover from his surprise. A groan \u2014 the faint groan of the despairing, escaped his lips, and he lay upon the pave ment, lifeless as a stone. No human ear. save mine, had heard his fall \u2014 no human eye, save mine, had seen the deed. I rolled him in his cloak, and dragged him to the lagoen hard by. A pile of stones lay near, from which I gathered a dozen of the largest, and placed them on the lody ; then taking a cord from my girdle, care fully tied the cloak around them all, and plunged the bulk into the watery tide. It sank, and, till now, no human ear hath heard of the fate of our doge's elder brother.\" \" 'Twas a base and bloody deed I\" exclaimed the gondolier, shuddering, as he turned his gaze away from the old man, and looked fearfully around to see if other ears beside his own had listened to the dark recital. \" A base and bloody deed!\" repeated the other, mockingly ; \" a base and bloody deed! Pah I He would have slain thy mother's honour, robbed me of peace for life, and made wanton with a score ot hearts as tond, as trusting as hers \u2014 perchance driven a hundred others into despair, like me\u2014 had I uot slain him. Pah ! He was a villain, and deserved it. He was a noble, and the trampler on peace, virtue, and honesty ; he had well nigh murdered my peace for ever, and for that act, I became mine own avenger. But mark, bow his kindred have avenged him\u2014 his nephew, the present young Foscari, beguiled, seduced my only daughter \u2014 thy sisler\u2014 and yet he is at large- branded eternal shame upon her erst inno cent forehead, and upon mine and thine, and yet he lives to play the same pranks upon others. Thou knowest that that vile deed of his sent the heart and hairs of thy mother with anguish to the tomb, and made a wanton of thy sister, and made the ruin of our house what it is, and all but broke the heart of him who wooed her ere Foscari laid his serpent eyes upon her to lure her on to ruin \u2014 and yet he lives arid so do I\u2014 I, in weakness and grey hairs ; and so dost thou \u2014 thou, in young manhood's vaunted strength and fire ! ' The hour hath not come,' thou say'st. Three years have flown since first the dastardly deed was consummated, and yet tor thee and vengeance, 'ihe hour hath not yet come!' Out upon thee coward, boy!\" '"], [25, "THE ORANGE GIRL Of VENICE; 15 \" Father, father,\" groaned the young gondolier, passionately* \" crush not my spirit by branding me with such opprobrious names. Coward! boy! Oh!\" \" What art thou else ?\" said the old man, gibingly, and glancing maliciously at his son. \"What art thou else ? Where is the bold spirit, where the lion-daring that should mark thy years i For three years hath the cloud of wrong floated over our house \u2014 for three long years hath the finger of scorn pointed at us as varlets that patiently submit to infamy, oppression, indignity, without the courage to raise a finger to smite the villain down. Three long years of shame, opprobrium, three long years \u2014 an old man, I \u2014 a young man, thou ! Three long years of una venged shame \u2014 three long years \u2014 think of that !\" The young gondolier groaned deeply. He buried his head in his broad, tanned hands, and wept like a child. \" Has thou a soul \u2014 a heart, a braiu, an eye, a hahd ?\" persisted the old man, hissingly. \" Hast either of these \u2014 and yet wearest shame, cowardice, upon thy brow ? Hast thou a heart, a hand, I say, and dost thou play the woman's game , \u2014 watching. Out on thee, craven !\" \" Father !\" \" Not a word ! \u2014 not a word ! and dare not call me by that name again, or I shall smite thee. ' Father !' Who gave thee the right to call me by that name ? Dost dare to call thyself of my blood \u2014 my name\u2014 my race? 'Father!' Now, as I live ! I do believe thee to be the spawn of some chicken-hearted dastard whose wily arts exchanged thee, in infancy, for mine own proud souled and fearless child, when my wife was absent. Go to ! thou art no son of mine I\" The chafed spirit of the young gondolier could stand no more. He sprang upon the old man, and, grasping him by the collar, with one stern ard sudden jerk, stretched him, lengthwise, upon the pavement ; then planting one knee upon his breast, he, with his disengaged hand, drew a long, narrow blade from his gir dle and, raising it aloft, exclaimed, \u2014 \" If thou wouldst have me an assassin, what subject so fit to dye this yet unstained knife, as thine own soul carcase ? Another word \u2014 another taunt \u2014 and though thou wert ten times my father, thou'lt find I am not the poor, patient, gibe-bearing spaniel thou deemest me.\" \" Let go thy hold !\" cried the old man, struggling and writhing, as the white foam of passion gathered around his lips. Let go thy hold, or I shall call for help!\" \"Call on, I care not!\" exclaimed the gondolier, huskily, \"call oh, I care not, even if thou shouldst be answered by the all potent ' Ten' !\" \" The Ten I\" said a low, deep voice beside him. \"The Ten! it is a terrible power to defy !\" The gondolier started at the unexpected and thrilling voice. Did he know it ? Was there a magic spell in its deep rich tone, that his ear recognised an old ac quaintance? His fingers let go their clutch of the prostrate fiuit-vendor \u2014 the knife dropped from his hand \u2014 his face lost its passionate flush, and was usurped by a chalk-like paleness. He rose from his threatening position by thc old man, and catching the eye and cloaked form of the stranger, dropped upon one knee before him, saying, \u2014 \" What wouldst thou, master ?\" \" Does such an attitude become a Venetian ?\" said the stranger impatiently ; \" To thy feet, man\u2014 to thy feet !\" The gondolier, crimsoning to tbe temples, started up, and suddenly doffing his plumeless cap, with downcast eyes, and in a voice husky with shame and emo- tion, inquired, \u2014 \"Att in need ?'' \" I am,\" replied the stranger, softly ; \" a burden not far from hence needs thy carrying. I have had a heavy task of it, myself, this hour, and need aid. Canst go ?\" \" I can.'' \" Then follow me.\""], [26, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 16 Thev lest the spot together ; and, ere the old fruit-vendor could recover from tbe effects of their sudden meeting and departure, the stranger and gondolier We\u00abr'eT\u00b0here'fs9molre in this than I can fathom,\" saicTthe old man, pondering over the stranc-e scene ; \" there is matter touching the state in't!

They walked on, the stranger and the gondolier. They kept side by side, and spoke in low tones. They walked on firmly, yet nervously, as if on each step the existence of an empire depended. The streets, and squares, and quays were now alive with tbe young and aged, of every class, returning to their homes. The deep-toned bell of St. Mark's fell upon their ears, and throughout Venice its heavy toll warned the populace that it lacked but an hour of midnight. Tbe moon and stars waxed paler and dimmer every moment, till the stranger and bis companion could scarce see their way. Still they walked on. Wished they for darkness? The moon and stars were hid. The whole vault of heaven was curtained with drapery, dark and thick and frightful. It seemed as if man's last hope had been cut off \u2014 as if Deity had drawn a sheet of darkness between his throne and earth, that his already offended eye might be no more offended by the deeds of darkness committed by man upon his fellow man. Yet the elements were not at peace : \u2014 the winds played bo-peep with each other on the Lagoons and throughout the corners of old Venice, as if to frighten the few still awake, and to arouse to wakeful fear the thousands sleeping. They wandered on, the gondolier and the stranger. They had already traversed half of Venice, and yet had not reached their goal, if goal they had in view. They had neared the Rialto, still in conversation earnest as when they had first set out, when the watchful eye of the stranger discerned lights ahead. He laid his hand upon the arm of his companion, and pointing to the advancing; torches, both noiselessly and cautiously drew back, and concealed themselves behind a broad, towering pillar at the base of the bridge."], [27, "TIIE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 17 Now, whispered the stranger to his companion, \" now, thou wilt see the scourge of our fair ,sle ; now, thou wilt behold the instruments of that power the very name of which makes the cheek of childhood turn pale, and the nerves of gay youth and stern manhood turn watery. Behold, but speak not\u2014 stir not\u2014 breathe not ; nay, utter not a word, though the victim be thine own sire !\" \" I will not,\" said his companion. \"Huah \u2014 they came !\" In silence, and with slow and solemn step, a double file of guards, six on each side, and each bearing a naked, double-edged sword, crossed the Rialto, and passed the pillar behind which the stranger and his companion were concealed. In th it midst, with ponderous and muffled chains around his wrists, was a^oung man of some seven-and-twcnty years, in the garb of a gondolier, A tall, half-naked, No, 3,"], [28, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 18 ,warthv-complexioned slave, bearing a torch in one hand, guarded either side of the prisoner ; while before and behind the little troop marched one in the costume of a cowled monk, with a long, white cross in his right hand, earned carelessly like a cane. , , , f \" Ha !\" exclaimed the gondolier, as his eye fell upon the prisoner s lace, \" 'tis \" , v But ere he could complete the sentence, the hand of the stranger was upon ms mouth. The procession with its victim passed on, and, turning an angle ot the square, was soon lost to view. \u201e,, \" Rash man !\" exclaimed the stranger, reproachfully, \" would'st betray us I But the latter answered not\u2014 a film was before his eyes\u2014 his whole frame shook with terror and emotion -and he sank into the arms of the stranger, speechless. The winds whistled, and the Rialto seemed almost on the point of giving way before the violence of the gale. CHAPTER VII the storm. The belfry of St. Mark's gave a solitary toll ; the gale swept around the old tower, and gave to i ts chime a heavv, stern, iron-like sound, which seemed almost powerful enough to re-awake to time and being the tomb-sleepers of old Venice. The wail of the increasing gale seemed like a dirge of devils over the corse of their king, in the royal chamber of the Shades. The Rialto shook as if an earthquake were coursing beneath its foundations. The gale was at its height. As if the ministers of Deity had been ordered to level their several shafts at earth and destroy it, the windows of heaven were opened \u2014 of lightning, flash succeeded flash, and peal followed peal ol thunder \u2014 the rain came rushing down upon the seemingly-doomed city \u2014 and the angry blast flew around the squares and lagoons as if determined to make a chaos of the isle towering above the waters. Mothers, with their infants in their arms, started out of their beds affrighted, and with their nurslings, crouched in corners and dark places to hide them from the broad, bright flashes of the red lightning, and the deafening roars of the booming thunder. Young and tender-hearted brides crept, shudderingly, from their couches, and dropped upon their knees, in prayer. Old men, hoary with age and crime, turned pale, and mumbled half-broken sentences of long-forgotten prayers. Widowed matrons, upon their knees, sent up suppli cations to the throne of the Most High, for sons exposed to the dangers of the angry deep; and youthful and hoary monks counted their beads and said earnest prayers that He would yet spare the criminal city for repentance. The waters of the lagoons were swollen to a fearful height, deluging the piers and streets, aod sweeping off into the tide of the broad Adriatic every floating thing that came within their reach. Yet all was darkness, save when, ever and anon, the gleam of some fitful flash exposed the havoc of the storm. The stranger, cloaked, bent over the senseless gondolier, who lay in a sitting posture, at the base of the pillar, and shielded him from the descending rain ; though drenched to ihe skin, thc noble cared not for himself, but had every thought centered upon thc peril of his companion. \" Terror hath uunen ed, unwitted him,\" he muttered, \"and the discord and battle of the elements have not in them enough of power to wake him !\" The tide roso%igher, and the noble felt the water entering his shoes. Quick as thought, he raised the inanimate gondolier from his perilous position, and dragged"], [29, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 19 him up the bridge. This sudden movement, together with the sharp, heavy and rapid beatings of the rain, roused the latter from his stupor. He started, and put out his hands wildly \u2014 for the darkness prevented his eyes from being of any ser vice \u2014 and he felt the cloak and hand of the noble. At this moment, a hrigh flash revealed the face ofthe latter, and the evening's events rushing through his mind, he cried out : \u2014 \" Still here ? Let us fly !\" \"Whither?'' responded the noble, as a chill ran through his frame at sight of the ghastly features of his companion. \"Whither? The streets and piers and squares are deluged, and the Rialto alone affords refuge from the waters. Here we must abide till the storm gives o'er!\" \" But we shall die here !\" \" Die! Fear it not : fate hath not yet spoken such decree ; and till it hath, why fear the mere playthings of fate? The rain may wet, the tempest rage, the lightning play in antics in yon clouds, but till the word is spoken in tones louder than yon rumbling thunder, Galliano shall bethink him of life, not death !\" Scarce had he spoken, when a broad, bright flash, that, for a moment, lit every thing around brighter than noon-day, struck the spire of the marble-pillar, which had been the concealment of the companions, shivering it in fragments. \"Lo, the warning ofthe waters!\" exclaimed Galliano, pointing to the ruins. But five minutes agone, thou and I were there, for shelter and concealment. Now, behold the wreck of our ark ! The lightning hath robbed it of its glory and its power, and we must here bide the peltings of the pitiless storm!\" All was darkness again, and yet the eyes ofthe two were rivetted in silence, in the direction of the shattered pillar. A dim, hazy light seemed to rise from its centre, like the faint rays of a lamp in some dark passage. The pillar, broken as it was, was still about three feet above the level of the fast rising waters sur rounding it. The rain fell ceaselessly, and yet that strange, dim light, still shone around the broken remnant of the pillar. Cautiously, tbe noble and his com panion advanced towards the spot. They looked down \u2014 the pillar was hollow, and a circular flight of narrow stairs, widening as they descended, met their* gaze. A lamp with five burners, was suspended from the ceiling, a small distance from the gap, apparently under the earth. The entrance was not more than five feet, but gradually widened in its descent. The walls were damp, and big drops of vault-sweat were continually falling to the bottom. A low, moaning noise saluted the ears of Galliano and his companion, as they bent their heads and listened. A sickly pallor overspread the features of the latter, and a momentary tremor ran throujh his frame. He glanced at Galliano, whose face was dimly seen by the reflection of the vault lamp ; but the latter, though gazing thoughtfully at the mysterious entrance, evinced not the slightest symptom of astonishment, or fear. \" What dost think it is ?\" said Paulo, gathering courage from the other's coolness. '' Think !\" answered the noble, with an exulting smile, \"think! why, that the elements have revealed to us one of the chief pathways to the dungeons ofthe 'Ten.' Had we now but twenty men, brave-hearted and true, we might storm this dungeon-entrance, and perhaps rid Venice of its tyrants, without the spilling of more blood than flows in the veins ofthe death-dealing 'council!' Dost thou not see through it all?\" continued Galliano, his face radiating with alternate scorn and pleasure at the discovery ; \" dost not see through it all ? For safety and escape, should they be assailed in their infernal council, lo! the staircase and the ma-nc outlet ! Would they, at midnight, enter, unobserved, their bloody caverns, lo ! the marble door ! When their fiendish tortures bave put to death a victim, lo ! the staiicase and the door \u2014 c-losc beside the canal \u2014 by which, at dark hour and solemn, to slide the mutilated corse into the deep lagoon! Who dies in Venice ? Who breathes his spirit out, among his kindred, on the calm and peaceful couch of home? We die not \u2014 we disappear ! and the Adriatic tide of an after day, finds us floating down fts current, our bodies crisped and headless \u2014 memorials of Blood,"], [30, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 20 pillar, and we, we the patriotic band, we ot the sworn body, shall rend the tyrants excited almost to delirium, yet the young noble's voice rose not said Paulo, looking earnestly around ; \"eyes, even now, may bC.\"rgood faS not L'CpL the noble, coolly ;\u00ab.; I \u00bb not hence till these eyes know more of the mysteries of yon staircase. Wilt follow me . \u2022* I have no weapon,\" answered the gondolier, halt tearlully. \"Thy knife?\" said Galliano, interrogatively. \"'I have it not.'' , ,,-.,.. .. \u2022_ \" Then fill thy pockets with scraps of yon strewed marble, said the noble, gaily, and springing into the pillar ; \"they will, I trow, be weapons enough to silence the clamors of any we may encounter ere our return. Hast got them .' \" I have.\" \"Stay, a moment, here is my dirk : thou may'st have need of it. Now, as thou hast a heart, follow me!\" . . . The noble drew his oft-tried rapier, and, throwing off his cloak, that it mignt not interrupt his activity, or speed, quickly, yet cautiously, descended the narrow stairs. The gondolier followed after him, noiselessly as possible, his heart beating painfully with excitement. CHAPTER VIII. THE OUNGEONS OF THE TRIBUNAL After descending the spiral staircase, our heroes, on verging to the Tight found themselves in a long, broad avenue, of an iron hue, dimly lighted by lamps with three burners, suspended by heavy chains from the ceiling. On either side of the passage were massive oaken doors, covered with heavy iron bars, rivetted transversely, and each fastened outwards by a ponderous padlock. The cells were ranged in pairs, \u2014 i. e. every pair formed one little block, or square, which was divided from the next by a narrow pathway leading into the avenue behind it. The passages were covered with a dark, yielding substance, which had the effect of killing the echo of a footfall ; so that, while one stood conversing with a com panion, a spy might, unheard, turn an angle, and, approaching within earshot, catch every word. The door of each cell was numbered, near the top, imme diately under a transversed pair of shoulder-bones, surmounted by a grinning sknll \u2014 tbe relics, doubtless, of the cell's last victim. The ceiling of this sub terranean vault presented a dark, spongy aspect, a3 if intended to drown the loudest sound, and thus prevent the groans of the tribunal's victims from being heard above. The noble, despite his natural nerve, paused and shuddered at the grim silence and appalling aspect of the strange scene. A dreary, heavy, choking atmosphere was around him, and he repented of having thrown away his cloak. Taking a few steps onward, a sudden and unaccountable feeling came over him. The iron of his nerves seemed gradually departing, and the invincible energy and indomitable resolution of his nature, by some mysterious process, appealed to be oozin\""], [31, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 21 through his pores, and his blood, weak and tremulous, felt as if converted kito water. His cheeks and lips blanched \u2014 heavy drops of hot sweat rolled rapidly down his limbs \u2014 his eyes grew haggard \u2014 his lips quivered \u2014 the moisture was fast departing from his gums \u2014 his knees smote each other \u2014 respiration grew, every moment, more and more difficult, and he felt as if the Icy-Hand were tugging with his frame to tear away his heart. A long, deep, agonising groan fell upon his ear, and, dropping on his hands and knees, his face close to tbe ground, he crawled, shuddering! y, backwards, in the direction of the staircase. His feet touched somethiBg heavy behind him, and, turning his face, Galliano beheld his companion stretched upon the pave, his mouth and eyes agape, his erst sun-burnt cheeks pale as chalk, his lips twitching as isa serpent were gnawing them within, his breast heaving with agony, and his arms swinging above his head frantically, as if to ward off some horrid phantom visible to his terrified eyes. With a bold and convulsive effort, the noble passed him, and, weak and faint, reached the base of the staircase. A few moments sojourn there partially recovered him ; when, anxious for his companion, and deeming his strength sufficiently restored for the task, he boldly rushed into the passage, and, catching the gondolier by the collar of his jacket, dragged the body, hastily, into the area by the stairs. The sudden change of atmosphere soon restored the latter to his senses, and re invigorated the strength of both \u2014 yet both were pale, very pale. Their eyes were strained and bloodshot with their recent terror and struggles to escape the empoisoned air. \" We have seen enough \u2014 let us now depart,\" said Paulo, half whisper ingly. \" Not I,\" replied Galliano ; \" life and curiosity are yet sufficiently strong within me, to urge me on to more than a glance at these infernal avenues. I must behoid in full, ere I again ascend to the world above us. The atmosphere of the avenues beyond is, perchance, better than that of tbe first. Did'st notice that it was not till we passed the third block of cells that the air changed so suddenly, and that it was when near the fourth that the deadly ether first saluted us?\" \" Methinks I did ; but what interference drew you from that?\" \" A plain one,\" replied the noble ; \" murder is going on in that cell \u2014 murder, not by the knife, nor by the pincer, nor by the thumb screw, rack or burning floor \u2014 but murder by robbing the poor victim of his feelings and senses one by one, that, with his last gasp, the victim may spring into the portals of Eternity with a thrill of agony unequalled by any other torture. Did'st hear a groan !\" \"I did.\" \" Be sure 'twas the victim's last ! No torture could drag from living clay such a groan as that; it, more than the sulphurous air, struck me to my knees !\" \" So did it me \u2014 I never heard its like.\" \" Hush !\" said Galliano, whisperingly, and placing his finger on his lip. A sound like tbe rumbling ofa door swinging upon its rusty hinges, now jarred upon their ears. The noble peeped into the passage, and beheld a sight which made his blood creep. Two stout, goodly sized wretches, garbed in long greasy, blood-stained tunics, without sleeves, and sandalled and capped, were dragging the remains of their victim on a broad board from the cell. The body was entirely naked, and by the process of the torture, reduced almost to a skeleton. The little flesh that remained upon the limbs was torn and ragged, as if by the violent struggles of the victim while writhing under the poisonous and sense-killing vapour. The wretches, after having taken out the body and the vapour box, threw in a powder to kill the effluvia remaining in the cell, carefully locked the door, and taking up the body, slowly and silently disappeared through an adjoining passage. \" The curse of a Venetian be upon ye, bloodhounds !\" muttered the young noble, shaking his doubled fist in the direction which they had taken. \" Follow"], [32, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 22 jne!\" he exclaimed, turning suddenly to his companion, and immediately dart ing into the vault, apparently with the intention ot hastening after the murderers, and inflicting upon them the punishment due to their crime. The noble ran with speed, but soon found himself bewildered in the countless and complicated passages. His sword was drawn, and, grasping it firmly in his hand, he darted from avenue to avenue, from narrow passage to narrow passage, his eyes the while, searching every lighted and dark spot for tlie myrmidons of the tribunal, but all in vain \u2014 they had vanished. Tired, panting and spent out, he leaned against a cell, in one of the avenues, for support. Having rested awhile, and bethinking him of his companion, he strode swiftly in, what appeared to him, the direction of the staircase. But in this he was baffled; for, notwith standing all his efforts, he could not reach the spot. Avenue after avenue, passage after passage he traversed, but all in vain, and he was forced to trust to chance in reaching it at all. In this critical situation, and pondering on the dangers to which he was exposed, he resolved to explore every avenue and passage till all the secrets of the vault were known to him, or till he stumbled upon some path leading to au outlet. Accordingly, he paced impatiently the lengthy avenue in which he stood, till he unexpectedly found himself within a few yards of an approaching personage, masked and enveloped in a long, dark mantle. Fortunately for Galliano, his own sombre costume, the sound-killing pave, and the darkness around, prevented him from being seen or heard, and he darted hastily into a side passage, where he overheard a voice demanding of the approaching figure the password. \"The cross of St. Mark's,\" was the response. *' Pass on,\" said the voice, in a satisfied tone. As Galliano was about leaving his concealment, a hand, from some one behind, was laid gently upon his shoulder, and some one whispered into his ear, \u2014 '\u25a0Stay! Death is before thee!\" \" Ha !\" exclaimed the noble, quickly recognising and grasping the hand of the gondolier ; \" I'm glad I've found thee. I thought thee lost in these infernal labyrinths.\" \" I have been searching for thee,\" sai*.! the other, in a hollow whisper. \" Knowest thou tbe direction of the staircase V continued Galliano, earnestly, \" for I have lost it.\" A despairiug groan escaped the gondolier, as he replied, \" and I, great God !\" \"Hush!\" exclaimed the noble, quickly, and clapping his hand to his com panion's mouth, \" thou'lt betray us !\" They plunged deeper into the gloomy pass, and stood mute as statues ; when, finding they were not overheard, they stole carefully into the avenue behind, and, after looking watchfully around, walked onward. As they passed on, a masked figure, holding a sharp-pointed spear, suddenly darted from an adjjining passage demanding sternly, \u2014 \" The password?'' \" The cross of St. Mark's,\" replied Galliano, carelessly, and passing ou. \" The password, thou?\" said the figure addressing Paulo. ''The cross of St. Mark's,' muttered the gondolier, in a tone, which nothing but the last, bold effort of the despairiug could call up. \" Pass on,\" was the response. Tremblingly, indeed, did Paulo obey the order, whiie the sentinel returned silently into the passage from which he had so suddenly emerged. \" Cease thy trembling man,\" whispered the noDle, \" else we are ruined ! By chance I learned the wat.-hword, and therefore was prepared for the fellow's challenge. Remember it !\" \" I shall ;\u2014 \" the cross of St. Mark's !\" \" Aye ! That knave was a watchman, and challenged us when we passed hia post. Be sure we'll meet with others, ere we reach our goal.\" \" Why not ask the next to lead us to the staircase I\""], [33, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 23 \" Umph ! I doub; if 'twould be safe. He would, for all our knowledge of the password, suspect us. Suspicion would be the forerunner of capture and certain death. No; we must trust to fortune for escape.\" \"The watchword,\" cried a figure, suddenly entering the avenue. They gave it, and passed on with throbbing hearts. \"'Tis a mercy he overheard us not,\" whispered Galliano; \"we must be chary of our speech. Tiiese villains must have their allotted posts, like the watchmen of our city. Count the dungeon-9ets we pass, ere we again are challenged.\" \"Six,\" whispered the gondolier, as soon as they had passed the next sentry. \"Right, my count exactly,\" said the noble, softly; \"could we now, thrrugb the dim light of these avenues, but learn the number of dungeon-squares from end to end of the vamt, and the number of avenues, we might easily compute the amount of sentries at all times on guard here.\" \" The advantage of such knowledge ?\" \" We then might guess the number of foes we should be likely to meet, in case we should storm the ' Ten ' in this, their den. I doubt much if their number is as great as the prevailing fears and reports of our countrymen would lead one to imagine. Their great weapons are mystery and fear. Venetians are prone to fear an unseen power, and that is an all- subduing sword when properly handled. And yet, after all how men, gifted with reasoning faculties and brave hearts, can be frightened by such paltry bug -bears is more than I can fathom. A mystery is easily made up by the simplest mind ; the lookers on may see the action of the mystery, but the mind that created it sees in't only the working result of his own mechanism ; tear away the cover, or the curtain, and the gaping spectators, seeing the machinery, no longer wonder. These dungeons look mysterious and terrible, and yet they are nothing more than thick wooden boards put together by the aid of iron nails and ordinary rivets. The head and bones of some poor victim are nailed upon them, for effect. Take away the human \u2014 human ? inhuman, rather \u2014 instruments, and of what danger can the dumb bones and painted boards be ? A frowning, elf-like visage and physique, like to the form and features of the last knave tbat challenged us, are easily made up by the aid of paint aud dirt and black cloth. They might be made on blocks, to frighten children with, and yet the scare-crow would be harmless ; so with these knaves on duty here ; disrobe them of their black tunics, shave them of their matted beards and lanky wigs, wash them of their stained hands and filthy faces, and what would their bare forms present of terror more than ours ? Pah ! that men should suffer wrongs, and let the perpetrators pass unpunished, because wrapped in mystery and paint !\" The gondolier acknowledged the truth of these observations, but, though physi- cally brave, he could not shake off the fears which his adventures among the dungeons thus far, had gathered round him. They passed on, giving the password whenever demanded, till they reached the end of the avenue \u2014 but no outlet met their view. \" What shall we do ?\" cried Paulo, whose presence of mind and courage now seemed to shrink at the hopeless prospect before them. \" Pass on to the next,\" was the cool response. \" But the sentries there may be the same that we have already met,\" added the gendolier, falteringly. \" We'll make sure they are not, by taking our path to the one beyond. Lo, our goal! see where the light gleams in yon area.\" continued Galliano, when they had reached the point proposed, and pointing, as he spoke to what seemed to be the entrance to the staircase. The hearts of both bounded, as they saw deliverance. They pressed forward hastily, but on reaching the threshold of the area, the cheek of the gondolier blanched as if suddenly converted into marble \u2014 they were on the threshold of the hall leading to the council chamber ; a sentry was on duty there \u2014 almost before them \u2014 pacing slowly, up and down the ball. His back was towards them, when they approached so near his post. He was about turning, when a sudden jerk o f"], [34, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 24 rhe gondolier, by the hand of Galliano, preserved both from the eyes ofthe sentry as he re-paced the pave by the door. \" Where is thy coolness \u2014 where thine eyes, man,\" muttered tbe noble, as they hurried into a conti nous and dark passage. They had been in their Concealment scarce a minute, when a cavalier cloaked and masked, and wearing a scarlet cap shaped like a sugar-loaf, which was ornamented by a tall, white feather, fastened by a glittering loop in front, passed them and entered the hall. \" The password ?\" demanded the sentinel, presenting his spear. \"The mercy ofthe Ten,\" responded the cavalier, laughing. \" Pass,\" said the sentinel, recovering his weapon, and resuming his pace. \" The watchword is changed !\" whispered Paulo, aghast. \" Aye, for that department,\" added the noble, in explanation. \" Fear not\u2014 another door than tbe one we entered, must be near at hand as the quick breathing and sudden entrance of yon cavalier plainly denote. Let us seek it.\" They emerged slowly from their\" concealment, and watching the moment when the sentinel had turned, strode hastily past the door. Turning an angle, some few yards beyond, they found themselves in a broad, high arched passage, whose only light was received from a torch, which stood in the centre of the pave, supported by three portable, upraised poles. \"We are near the door,\" whispered the noble; \" dost detect the coolness of the air ?* \" I do,\" responded Paulo, looking fearfully around. \"Have the dagger I gave thee at hand,\" continued Galliano, \" for if there be a pass word for the knave who stands sentry at the door other than the ones we have, we must fight for our egress.'' As they proceeded, the passage, at every step grew less wid e, till only one person could make his way. A faint light ahead encouraged them, and they trod swiftly on, when all at once, they found themselves in a large, semi-circular vault, lighted by three lamps, hanging by chains from the high arched ceiling, each about forty feet from the other. The atmosphere was cold and refreshing, and contrasted strongly with the confined air of the vault they had just left. A sound like the rushing of waters tell upon their ears, but no human object met their searching eyes. By the light ofthe burning lamps, they could distinctly perceive a semi-circular range of dungeons before them, each heavily barred and locked. Convinced, by the atmosphere and the noise of the beating surge, that either a door or wiudow was at hand, the keen eye ofthe noble searched every|-ipot around, till, glancing upwards, over the range behind him, he discovered a small, grated window, through the broken panes of which the night winds rushed, and revealed to him at once the cause of the refreshing atmosphere around him. While pondering on what part of Venice the grated window faced, his companion touched him gently on the shoulder, and pointed silently to a figure, with his back towards them, sitting on a low stool, in the extreme corner of the vault. Imagining, and with reason, that this man must be the sentry of the main entranee though, in consequence of the gloom around him, no door was visible, Galliano touched his lip with his finger, to his companion, and, grasping firmly the hilt of his drawn sword, advanced, on tip-toe, in the direction of the sentry, when he suddenly grasped him by the throat, and hurled him to the ground. It was the work of a moment, and so hastily and perfectly had the feat been executed, that the poor wretch fell without a mutter, or a groan. \" A word, a whisper, or the slighter movement, and this steel is in thy throat !\" exclaimed Galliano, in a hurried whisper, as he stood threateningly over the prostrate figure, his sword pointing to his breast. \"Seize his keys!\" added the noble, to his companion, who, dagger in hand, had now approached. Paulo stosped, and, from the girdle of the unresisting sentinel, wrenched a hugh bunch of keys, and handed them, in silence to Galliano, who, grasping them"], [35, "THE ORANGE GIRL OP VENICE. 25 firmly, bade his astonished victim rise. The gondolier assisted, and, in the act, bared, his dagger across the wretch's throat, muttering as he did so, \u2014 \"Attempt to struggle, escape, or call /or help, and my knife and thy gullet shall be quickly acquainted !\" The poor wretch made no attempt to disobey, but gazed sullenly at his captors. \" Now, knave,\" said the young noble, imperatively, \" where is the door that ends from these infernal caverns ? Speak, or I'll slay thee !\" The sentinel spoke r.ot, but pointed to the wall in front of which he had been sitting. The noble turned, and discoverd a broad, dark door, with a huge lock and three heavy cross bars. Seizing, instinctively, the largest key, he applied it cautiously No. 4."], [36, "THR ORA.NGE GIRL OF VENICE. 26 to the key-hole, and turned the lock. Then sliding back the bars, the door easily came open, revealing a flight of broad, winding stairs. \"On reaching the top of yon staircase, where shall I find myself?\" demanded the noble, sternly. \" In a bare apartment, lit by a single lamp, the door of which, fastened by a single lock, opens into the Grand-square, directly fronting St. Mark's,\" replied the sentry. \" And that door can be opened from without ?\" \"Ay \u2014 by a latch-key, of which every member of the council is provided with a duplicate. The exterior of the apartment represents an ordinary dwelling, and is guarded on either side by the habitation of a member of tbe Tribunal.\" \" Is this the entrance for prisoners?\" \"It is.\" \" The only one ?\" \" No ; \u2014 there is another.\" \" And that \" \" Is through a secret door in the white pillar by the Rialto.\" J \" How long art thou on guard here ?\" \" From dusk till dawn.\" \" Thy name ?\" \"Ugerto.\" \" How long hast thou been in the service of the ' Ten?' \" \" Three years.\" \" Stayest thou by force ?\" \" I do.\" \" Thy wages ?\" \" Bread, wine, raiment and couch.\" \" If thou desert'st ?\" \" The creatures of the ' Ten' dare not desert.\" \"And if they do?\" \"If caught, the 'Fire Chamber' is their doom \u2014 they are burned to a crisp and their ashes flung, at midnight, into the Adriatic.\" \" Have any prisoners been brought through this door to-night ?\" \"Ay, two.\" \" The first\u2014\" \" A woman \u2014 the daughter of a noble.'' \" Her name !\" \"I know it not.\" \"Where is she now ?\" \" In the next range.\" \" Through yonder passage ?\" \" The same.\" \" And the second victim- The sentinel's face grew pale, and his voice husky, as he replied\u2014\" A gondo 1 ier, I think.\" \" Ha ! and he\u2014\" \" Lies chained in yonder cell \u2014 number eight.\" \" Is the key in this bunch ?\" \" Ay \u2014 the key of every cell in the first range is there.' \" And this is tbe first ranue ?\" \" It is.\" \" The number of ranges in all ?\" \"Twenty.\" \" And, of cells, each range counts. \u2014 \" Fifty.\" \" Stay a moment, till I open number eight.\""], [37, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 27 \" Thou can'st not, without my aid. Except by a practised hand, the lock cannot be turned without alarming the bell watcher; in the next range.\" \" The distance is too far for him to hear.\" \"\u2022 Thou dost mistake : to every lock there is a wire attached, that r ings a bell in tbe watch-room, which none but an accustomed turnkey can prevent.\" \" The motive of that ?\" \"* ' Tis a safeguard against strange hands, in case a stranger should, by any possi- lity, find entrance here, and seek te set captives free ; and also to prevent pri biners from escaping by fore ing the doors.\" \" Wilt thou open number eight?\" \" Ay, if thy companion here will take bis dagger from across my throat ?\" \" Dost know the prisoner in nnmber eight ?\" \"I do.\" \" His name ?\" \"Gennaro !\" \" Ha ! Didst thou know him ? \" I did !\" \"Wert thou of his calling?\" \" Ay, my lord ! I it was who first taught him how to pull the gondolier's oar ; taught him how to brave the deep and angry tide when billowy waves ran high amidst the storm. We slept under the same roof, ate at the same table, prayed the same prayers, from his infancy, till I was summoned before the ' Ten.' \" \" Indeed ! Who art thou?\" \" Gennaro 's father !\" \" Ha! his father ? Swear it!\" \"tAs I do hope for Heaven's mercy !\" \"Enough; I trust thee ! Release him!\" Paulo let go his hold, and the old sentinel bowed his thanks. Emotion was plainly visible on his boldly delineated features ; but it was the emotion of one who had long since learned to curb the rising passions of his heart. His face was livid, clammy ; his eyes large, dark, but lustreless ; his hands broad, bony, and indicative of great strength ; his form about the common height, his shoulders broadband covered with a loose, coarse, dark-hued tunic, which reached but slightly below his knees, revealing the nakedness of his legs and feet, the latter being preserved from contract with the ground by a pair of rough, black sandals. His arms were bare, and his chin and upper lip covered with a profusion of dark bushy hair. His aspect was hideous, gaunt, and grim. As the light of the hanging lamp fell upon his face, the keen eye of Galliano detected a twitching on his wrinkled brow and cheeks, and a swimming in his lustreless eyes, which plainly told how deeply his heart was wrung with suffering. \" Shall I open number eight ?\" asked the sentry, his voice thicker aud hoarser than before. \" Thou meanst no treachery ? ' \" By all my hopes of Heaven, no !\" \"Enough \u2014 I'll trust thee. Take the keys.\" The old man took the bunch, and, selecting the proper key, advanced towards the dungeon. After cautiously turning the lock and shoving back the bars, the door swung open, and the old man entered the cell. A noise, like the falling of chains, was heard, and, a few moments afterwards, the old man reappeared, bearing in his sinewy arms the slumbering body of his son. He laid his burden softly upon the pave before the noble ; and, kneeling by it, pointed to the body and exclaimed, in a low, choked voice, \u2014 \" Behold, in the dungeons of the masters and rulers of Venice \u2014 behold a sight for a father!\" \" Hast thou a father's heart and permittest thy son to lie there, when an effort of thine could restore him to life and freedom?\" said Galliano, in a stern, reproachful tone, eying the sentry."], [38, "28 THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. \" That effort were death to him and me,\" responded the old man, in a low, hoarse voice ; \" the argus-eyed Tribunal would hunt us in the extreme corners of the earth, and drag us back to unescaping death!\" \" What ! lovest thou life?\" \"Ay, count \u2014 for' my boy's sake.\" \"His sake! Ha! ha! old man, what aid canst thou render him ?\" \"None, my lord, till his sentence be o'er. Then \" \" Ha ! and then ?\" \" Then, \u2014 that is my secret, my lord !\" said the sentry, suddenly recollecting himsalf, and raising the body. '' Follow me, and thou shalt see,\" he added, lifting his son carefully, and walking in the direction of the passage through which the noble and bis companion had come. \" Ha ! stay, whither goest thou ?\" demanded Galliano, sternly, and advancing towards him. The sentry answered not, but on reaching the entrance to the passage, paused, and pressing a stone, a door in the wall flew open, into which the old inn entered cautiously, Galliano and his companion following, wonderingly. The apartment into which they entered was,6quare, about six feet in height, and the same in length and width. A small lamp rested on a low cross-legged table, which stood in the furthest corner, beside a bed. It was a wretched, filthy-looking hole, and the poisonous stench arising from the bed was almost sufficient to stran- gle tbe noble. Having entered, the sentry placed his senseless son upon the rude couch, and then carefully and silently closed the door. A bolt soon made the latter fast, and the old man, though really deeply agitated, seated himself coolly upon the foot of the bed, and gave a loud laugh. \" How now \u2014 the meaning of this?\" demanded the noble, a suspicion of trea- chery flashing across his mind. \" Let me have my laugh, my lord,\" said the sentry calmly. \" No living soul, ourselves excepted, is aware of the existence of this chamber. Tt is the handi- work of these unpractised hands, and made during the few hours allotted to me for \u2022deep. I have robbed nature ofher dues to cheat the eyes and interests of men. It is a rare workmanship, is it not, my lord ?\" he added, with a chuckle and a smile which gave him more the semblance of a demon than a man. \" Look, my lord, how tastefully the hangings and the tapestry are arranged.\" As he spoke, he touched a cord beside the foot of the couch, when, as if by magic, the sombreness of the walls changed to a beautiful and luxurous appearance, each side having a portrait in its centre. The ceiling was as white as porphyry, and a number of circles, each smaller than the other, were painted with great skill, in its centre, giving it the appearance of a magnificient dome. The table, by some mysterious process, assumed the aspect of a card board, and the low couch became a couch of rare beauty. The floor alone remained unchanged, and its dark hue presented a melan- choly contrast with the rest of the apartment. The noble and his companion were muce with astonishment. The former at last broke the silence, by demanding of the sentry \u2014 \" Art thou man, or devil ?\" \"Neither, my gracious lord,\" replied the sentry, wilh a sardonic grin, \" nor magician, nor fiend ; but a simple man, one who has made use of his simple wits to outwit the craftiest ones of Venice.\" \" The Tribunal ?\" \" The same, my lord. For years, they have played upon each nerve of this poor frame, till they have broken \u2014 as thev think \u2014 the sole remaining links that bind me to man.

But a few minutes had elapsed when the sentry again entered the apartment. \" Thou must return to thy dungeon,\" said he in a low deep tone. \" There is danger that thy cell may be searched between this and the coming night, and if in such case, thou were not found, my life would answer for thine absence.

THE HOUSE OF THE USURER. With our kind reader's leave, we will now leap over time a week, during which interregnum some instances pertaining to this history transpired, which in their proper time and place shall find a fitting record. We'll change the scene, too, aud usher into sight one fair being whom we have already kept too far in the vista \u2014 our herione. Reader, hast thou ever been in the favoured land\u2014 the land of song and beauty; the land, above all others, where the Eternal One tarried the longest while creating his fair and beauteous earth \u2014 the land where every zephyr is an angel's whisper \u2014 whereevery rustling of a flower leaf is a flower's sigh \u2014 where the orange blooms with a moistening, golden beauty that almost shames the bright and mellowing sun \u2014 where the dews of dawn infuse new life, new strength, new blood, new nerve, into the weariest frame \u2014 where the pale cheek is made rosy and healthful asjthe first blush of youth, by the pellucid atmosphere \u2014 where, at night,\" the stars shine brightest, and the moon gleams purest \u2014 where the sky is bluer, the clouds lovelier, the atmosphere clearer, the flowers brighter, gayer, and more lovely iii their variegated hues, and the waters more blue and clear than in any other of the water-bound islets of God's fair garden, earth \u2014 where man is blithest, gayest, boldest \u2014 where woman is more the seraph, and \u2014 at the) same time syren, the syren conscious of the all-conquering attributes of her nature \u2014 where old men of three-score are glad, joyous, and fleet-limbed as the youth of eighteen of less favoured climes \u2014 where every gale hath music in it \u2014 where the very waves dash on the pale sands like murmuring lullabys, and are echoed by the busy, everflying zephyrs above \u2014 and where the full, loud, ripe, hearty laugh is heard from every honest heart, the isle around, for very mirth and gladness \u2014 Venice ? Hast thou been there, reader mine, and not felt thyself nearer the Paradise of eastern fable, or that truer, holier home spoken of in the Tome of Tomes, than ever, in reality, or in thy dreams before? What though dark dungeons and bridges, and narrow winding waters, confront thee at every turn ; what though mystic tales, and legends of terror and mystery, salute thine ear at dawn, high noon, and dusk, and even ; what though grim processions, and fiendish instruments of a power inhuman, warn thee to be mute in thy speech and thought, and ever inert in action ; what then ? The calm, refreshing, invigorating air ; the mellow haze, and inspirit!' g sheen, of earth's day-god ; the bright blue sky; the deep, broad, gay, sun-kissed minor of the clouds and sky; the Adriatic; are about thee still, telling thee of beauties so vast and glorious, that man, for all his powers of appreciation of the blight and beautiful \u2014 for all his scepticism of the works of the Deity \u2014 for all his loathing of the depravity of man \u2014 must first bow his head in worship to the bright and beautiful, ere he passes censure on the things of ill and villany around him. In an obscure quarter of the city, in a dwelling as humble in its exterior as the obscurity of the section in which it stood, dwelt Uberoni, the usurer. Though strongly suspected of possessing wealth, the humble exterior of his abode seemed to give such belief the lie. Though as well known throughout Venice as the Do^e himself, and equally a9 loathed, yet, for all his reputation for wealth, no man's doors were freer from the depredations of midnight thieves, nor the person of Foscari himself more safe from danger or insult. In fact, he was strongly sus- pected of being one of the numerous instruments, or spies, of the secret and dreaded Tribunal, and by not a few was he secretly deemed to hold a more important position in the eyes of that terrible body. Though the quarter of the town in which he lived was inhabited by the poorest and vilest, and therefore the section most populated, still for years previous to the opening of our tale, the rude, low dwellings on either side of tbe usurer's house, had stood tenant- less. Though their rents were, comparatively, nominal, still so great and so universal"], [41, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 31 was the dread of this man, that the dwellings in question were shunned by all, as if a curse rested upon them. Whenever the usurer was seen to leave his door, at what hour soever of the day or night, the inhabitants of the street, though sitting before their own doors, ceased speaking \u2014the laugh was broken \u2014 the merry jest sundered \u2014 the low whisper silenced, each eye bent fearfully to the ground, till he had passed from their sight. His door was ever closed and locked, and his small windows heavily curtained \u2014 precautions almost entirely useless; for scarcely a being, of tbe thousands dwelling in that part of the city, passing, would bave had the nerve to turn his eye in the direction of the house, though its door stood agape. A small, square, faded sign hung by the entrance, giving notice of the name and calling of the tenant, and also of his business hours; still, as was well known to the people of that neighbourhood, the usurer did his business elsewhere. On a bright morning, about a week after the incidents recorded in the preceding chapter, a young, handsome, and gaily-attired cavalier was seen advancing in the direction of the usurer's house. He wore scarlet trousers, fitting tightly to the skin, the outward seams hidden by a bright, gold-spangled stripe ; a jacket, of blue velvet, trimmed with white ermine and snowy frills, and a jewelled cross ; a shoul der cloak, of the same glossy material ; a circular, low-crowned cap, of a hue cor responding with his cloak and jacket, ornamented with a high, ostrich plume, fastened in front by a jewelled loop ; white kid gauntlets, yellow boots, and a long slender, silver-bumished rapier. His figure was slightly above the common height, and finely moulded, his step firm and proud, his features of the Roman order, and haughty as the noblest-born of that once martial race ; his head was covered with hair of the deepest jet, and was thrown backwards in ringletted masses, revealing in full his broad, highly-polished brow ; he wore small moustaches, and his jetty beard was trimmed to a point. His whole appearance at once proclaimed his rank, and as he passed, the obsequious and deferential bows and dotting of caps, by tbe people, attested their knowledge of his name, caste, and person. On arriving at the house of the usurer, the young noble tapped hastily at the door. It. was opened slowly by a tall, stout black, dressed in a long, daric tunic, fastened to gether, in rough, careless folds, round the waist, by a leathern belt, from which hung a long slender dagger, encased in a sheath of plain brass ; apair of well-worn sandals completed his attire. \" Is thy master at home, knave V demanded the noble, haughtily. The black answered by gestures that he was, but engaged. \" But I must see him,\" said the noble, brushing past him haughtily, and enter ing a door on his right. The black gave a significant shrug, closed the door, and disappeared hastily down the basement stairs. \" Ho, ho, my trusty man-of-gold,\" cried the noble, laughing, on entering the room, as he caught a glimpse of a female dress hastily disappearing through the door ofan inner room. \" Ho, ho so thou hast not forgot thy young years yet \u2014 a petticoat in thy house ! Ho, ho ! a precious sage and moralist thou art, my trusty grey-beard !\" The usurer coloured, and was stammering an excuse, when the noble, laughing, interrupted him, saying, \u2014 \" Nay, no excuses ; bring in the lady \u2014 I must see her \u2014 you know how fond I am of the fair \u2014 what pains I take to make myself agreeable, and how agreeable I can make myself when I try. So oblige me with an introduction.\" \" Pardon me, my lord,\" said the usurer, slowly, \" but I cannot oblige you, at least to-day.\" \" Why not, my youthful money-lender?\" inquired the other, laughing ; \"you must have the poor thing imprisoned in this little box, like a captive bird, and allow no eyes other than your own, and that dumb porter's and knave of all-work of thine, to gaze upon her beauty, or listen to her songs! And that, too, while Leonardo Foscari \u2014 ' the Prince of Gay Gallants' \u2014 as his companions term him, lives !

Come, my gay Adonis, do let me have one word with \u2014 one glimpse of thy Venus !* \" Not to-day, my lord,\" was the cool response. \" What ! you won't ? Ha ! ha ! ha I By St. Mark, I do believe tbou hast been cutting thy stale bachelorship, and that this is thy honeymoon !

I know your old excuse to drag out of me a higher interest than usual. But it won't do, my venerable child. I must have the money, and instantly \u2014 my honour is pledged for it.'' \u2022\"* But your lordship has had three hundred ducats within this fortnight.\" \" His lordship is perfectly aware ofthe fact, and his lordship now wishes another hundred added to the amount, and that without delay, as his lordship feels himself growing more and more choleric,\" added the noble, in a tone not to be misunder stood. \" But I have not the money,\" said the usurer, biting his lip ; \" but I might pos sibly raise it of a friend, if I could give him a pawn for security.\" \" Nay, but thoul't raise it without security other than what thou hast had on the other three hundred,\" said the noble, playing with the hilt of his sword. \" But \" \" Nay, no buts for me,\" said the noble, laughing, but his pale visage giving the lie to his seeming pleasantness. \" I want the money, or I know a tale shall jeopardise thy head.\" \" My lord,\" gasped the usurer, turning pale, and starting. \" Ho, ho ! it brings thy pale liver up, does it ?\" said the noble, with a quiet smile of triumph. \" I thought it would.\" At this moment a groan was heard. The noble started, and looked wonderingly around ; when he again turned, he beheld the usurer lying upon the floor, his eyes turned upwards as if io death, and his thin lips covered with white foam. Somewhat startled, and still more confused, the young noble instantly resolved to quit the house, and relurn towards evening for the money which he needed. So, summoning tbe black, and pointing out to the slave the condition of his master, he, with hasty strides, took his departure. '\u2022 Ho, ho !\" he muttered, as he passed up the street, \" how soon that hint of the murder of old Galliano brought him to his senses. The pale fool thought it was forgotten. But he laboured under a mis ake. That is my hold upon his purse and services \u2014 when he fails me in either when he dares again to look me so boldly and insolently in the face \u2014 the base murder of his white-haired victim, the noble Galliano, shall be a luxurious end to tbe one I have in store for him. Ha, ha, ha ! And then, when I have eased him of his saucy blood, how easy it will be, with a troop of disguised and masked confederates, to enter his crib at night, and take possession of his strong box. Ha, ha, ha ! The thought is quite refreshing. But that groan \u2014 what could it mean ? Spirits bide not themselves in holes and corners by day. So our worthy confessors tell us, and they, passing their days and nights in holy and spiritual studies, should know. And the mysterious petticoat, too \u2014 I must understand it, and that before long.

OF VENICE. 33 When the usurer recovered from his spasm, which he did in about half an hour, he found himself stretched on a low, broail, cushioned bench, his head supported by a high pillow. A young girl, of some e. ghteen or nineteen years, sat on a low bench beside him, wiping, with her handke* -chief, the saliva from his lips, and the cold moisture from his cheeks and brow. 1 'he stony eyes of the usurer fell on her fair, small, tanned features, and rested there in silence. She was small in stature, but of a contour of form and features that would strike a sculptor wit reverence and awe. Her lips were small, but shaped like a perfect bow, and were ripe aud rosy as the flower that, itself tbe loveliest, reins queen amid the fairest. Her brow was high, but, like the rest of her skin, bronzed by her Italian sun.

It consisted of a dark meriQo frock, fitting close to the shoulders , and waist, and reaching a little below the knees, while her small and delicateN .--shaped feet and ankles were encased in black silk stockings, and buskins of the same hue. She was pale, and the expression of her large dark eyes, as tb ey met the usurer's, was,; \u2014 \" Thou poor, suffering man, 1 can fed ;1 for thee ; for I, too, am a sufferer. The usurer interpreted tho glance, a nd the hard stoniness of his eyes imme diately changed into a moistening sof tness that, it was evident, was unusual to them. Finding this sudden change was visible to the young girl, and fearing that it might be seized by her for a purpose which would conflict with his interest, the usurer coughed to hide his feelings, and finding himself fully equal to the effort, started up with a brief \"th.jnks!\" and hastily left the room. Scarcely had he quitted the apar\\ment, \\vhen a hand from without, pushed by the curtain, and a small piece of parchm.ent was thrown into the room. The young girl picked it up, but ert she had tim e to read, the footstep or\" the usurer was heard, and in another miirjfnt he was befor. ; her.

The usurer smiled, and shook his head, as. he replied, \u2014 \"Thy friends cannot receive thee.\" \"Have they refused to?\" asked the young girl, weeping. \" They have not,\" replied the usurer, \"they would be glad, doubtless, to hav thee with them. Shall I tell thee a secret P and if so, wilt thou retain it ? \" \"I?\" She laughed, but a sob was mingled with it. \" Thou'rt ri?ht,\" said the usurer, catching the meaning of her laugh ; \"if thou hastno means of conversing, to whom canst thou reveal? Thou'rt right; and for that reason I will tell thee why thy friends cannot receive thee\u2014 they are not in Venice.\" \"No?\" \"No.\" \"But where, then?'' \" That remains a mystery.\" \u2022'Have they fled?\" \" By some strange means, they have,\" replied the usurer, \" but their flight is merely momentary, they will soon return.\" \" Thank Heaven for that !\" \" They would scarce thank thee for such offering.\" \" Ha !\" \" When they return \u2014 as return they must, they bu return to die !\" \" Are they then condemned ?'' \" The suspected in Venice are condemned before they are arrested.

Sooner than he wished, the old man stood in the council chamber, in the presence of those whose fiat vfrasas relentless asjtheir decrees were terrible. In a chamber eight- teen feet high, fifty broad, and fifty deep, the walls and ceiling hung with black, with devices of every torture used, curiously wrought thereon, each device being in itself a picture to fright the prisoner ere he has spoke a word, ere a word had been spoken to him, \u2014 with ten masked men, in black, sitting in a semi-circle, on a raised platform, before him, \u2014 pale,' but firm, the lord stood before his dooms- men.

Her features, indeed, changed, and, as the usurer paused, turned, shade by shade, -paler and paler, till her whole visage resembled a countenance of cold and frigid marble. Having exhausted his anger, and indifferent to the terrified feelings of his vetim, the usurer changed his tone, and added, in a bland voice\u2014 \"Time presses \u2014 I must"], [46, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 36 hence.

The hum of voices spread through the key -hole ofthe outer door \u2014 through the crevices in the crazy walls, and yet no sign, no token that the tenant of that little chamber lived and breathed.Jwas visible. There she sat, moveless asjnarble \u2014 her eye gazing on the spot where the usurer last had stood, as if unconscious of the absence of him she had seen standing there! Dnsk had stolen in \u2014 lightly at first \u2014 then heavier\u2014 even as grey hairs fall on the crown of man \u2014 until night had usurped the place of day. Night, with her stars and drapery, and clouds, and bright silver orb \u2014 night, fair and graceful and beautiful, without \u2014 night, all dark, and dreary, and cheerless within. She moved not, that beautiful, that terrified girl. The hours waxed on, and yet the usurer, contrary to bis word, did not make his appearance. Did his victim expect him \u2014 did she yearn for his arrival ? Midnight arrived \u2014 midnight : that hour when deeds unholy and dark and mur derous are perpetrated by God-defying hands ; that hour when the student's brightest conceptions flash athwart his vision, \u2014 when man ponders deepest on human schemes, and woman's dreams are holiest \u2014 midnight! The outer door swung back on its oiled hinges, noiselessly \u2014 the door of the chamber in which the orange girl sat, opened softly \u2014 a hand was laid upon her shoulder; the fear-spell was broken, and, without uttering a moan, or a sob, or a shriek, the orange girl turned her head slightly around. The unknown, at that moment, pulled aside the heavy drapery curtaining the window, when like a bright haze, the sheen of the moon fell upon her features, and the stranger beheld a fair, pale face, gazing at him, her eyes full and lustrous, and tears rushing, like a silent stream, adown her alabaster cheeks. \"Dost thou not know me?\" said the stranger, in a low, deep voice. \"Know thee !\" she repeated. \" Aye, thou poor, wronged girl,\" added the stranger, \" Dost thou not know me?

Bend low thine ear, and I will tell thee the name of him over whose grave I am to sleep and dream, till 1 have dreamt my soul away.\" The stranger obeyed. She whispered to him a word \u2014 but one \u2014 and, almost ere its final accents died upon her tongue, the chamber echoed with loud, wild, and thrilling laughter. ; \" Ha, h:\\ ha ! My father's ! Are circumstances and my suspicions at last verified ? Ha, ha, ha ! And am I in the house whose walls do hide his ashes ? Ha, ha, ha ! My father's grave foond at last \u2014 his murderer, too ! Ha, ha, ha ! Revenge, revenge, thou at last hast found out thine altar !\" He paced the apartment wildly, his brows knit, his cheeks pale, his hand clench ing the hfit of his oft-tried blade ; then, turning to the trembling girl, he cried, \u2014 \" But thou, poor victim of a coward's lust, and an assassin's tyrannv, thou mus hence ! I've pledged my honour to rescue and restore thee to tkose who, like thy self, bave felt the band of a villain. Nay, fear not \u2014 give me thy waist, girl. Time presses, and we must fly, while yet the tiger is absent from his lair.\" Throwing his arm around her. waist, and raising her like a feather from the ground, he was about rushing with his burden from the apartment, when his ear caught the sound of heavy and hurried footsteps, and the next moment the gigantic black mute stood on the threshold of the door, his h ft hand holding a burning torch, in his right a naked scimitar, while round his lips, and in his large sleepy looking eyes, there hovered a grin that would have answered for the chuckle of a fiend. The aspect of this personage was so revolting, that Galliano, despite his natural nerve, shuddered as his eye fell upon him. The orange girl crept closer and closer to the noble, twiuing ber arms tightly round his well-shaped neck, and gazed fearfully upon the hideous being before her. Conquering his momentary terror, and clasping firmer his burthen, the noble de manded, sternly, \u2014 \" Thf business, slave !\" The black raised his large dark eyes, and, pantomimically, ordered bim to set his burthen down and depart. The noble, now wholly self-possessed, laughingly responded, \" What if I obey not ?'' The black glanced significantly at his scimitar. \" Ah ! thou wilt make that acquainted with my breast ?\" The mute bowed. \" Thou art very kind, my prince of spades ; but, as I'm in no humoui for jest ing, I'll e'en disobey thee for the nonce. So give way, or I'll cleave thee to the head,\""], [48, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 38 The mute replied onlv bv planting the spear-pointed torch in the floor of the ball, and casti g on the noble a look of stem defiance. \"What!\" cried the noble, sharply, \" thou lovest sword-plav? Then taste the temper of mine ;\" and he aimed hasty blow at the head of the black, which was as quickly parried as given. A cold, heavy laugh warned the noble that he had no mean swordsman to deal with, and, setting hk burthen on a chair, he firmly, yet cautiously, reapproachel his antagonist in the hall. Their swords met, but so perfect was each in the art of handling his weapon, tbat neither could touch the flesh of his foe. At every thrust, the black warded off the glittering blade, with a derisive grin that called up all the pride and passion of the noble. Every trick of fence, every stratagem calculated to take away the other's guard, was resorted to, but without success \u2014 the black appeared invulnerable. On his part, the mute tried every move to bring his antagonist to disadvantage, but his efforts were vain \u2014 vic tory stood poised between them, not knowing the brow her garland yet should crown. Through the door the orange girl beheld the combat, which was to restore her to light and liberty, or plunge her deeper into misery. Told she not, in voiceless numbers, prayers to the Mighty One ? Tbe combatants paused spontaneously', as if to recover the muscularity of nerve spent in the all but silent trial. Lo! hand to liand, foot to foot, eye to eye, they are again. Every nerve is strained, every trick of fence again played o'er. Now, they thrust high \u2014 now low \u2014 now, round and round, like rings of gliteriDg steel dancing in the air, play their swords. O'er head and shoulders \u2014 -at breast and neck, they at -each-other aim.

Their eyes shoot fire and hate \u2014 their breasts swell with loathing and scorn which only those men feel who have a foe, yet know they cannot harm him, because his \u25a0courage and cunning are, at any moment, a full matc^i for theirs. \"Now, they eye each other doggedly, as if conscious that the third trial is victory to one, death to the other, or, perchance, death to both. Shrink they ? Mark the pale cheek \u2014 the clasped hands, the pnxious eyes of that poor, peril girt girl within, as they are rivetted upon the features of her champion ! Move not her lips ?

Yet would I give thee a chance for the retaining of thy life.

With Sff '\"if5 Withe as his, own, the noble, darted after bim, closely followed by the affrighted orange girl. As sbeflew pas t the distended black, a hasty hand attempt ed to grasp the skirt of her dress, but fear winged ber footsteps, and she escaped the death-clutch of the wounded mute.

The walls were thi .dc and* mouldy, and a chilly atmosphere pt irvaded its length and breadth. A small blind grating stood on one side of the vault, near the ceiling, while directly beneath it rose an earthy mound, shaped like a lowly grave. As the orange girl reached the foot of tbe rough, broad stairs ofthe vault, she started on beholding Galliano granping the distended usurer by the throat, with one hand, and, with the other pointing to tbe grave. The featiryea of the usurer were pale as ashes, his eyes seemed starting from their sockets, ar, d his whole frame shivered like one in the last throes of life. In his powerless, hand he grasped a broken blade, which plainly told the history of his last snort, h,ut hasty combat.

See \u2014 his hand is raised \u2014 'tis the signal for mine avenging sword ; Die, wretch ! Go, and join thy fellow-assassins in the realms of the Infernal !' Then dragging the body to the grave, he exclaimed \u2014 '* Father ! let thy troubled spirit rest : for here on the altar of thy grave, 1 immolate thy murderer.\" The sword of the frienzed noble passed thrice through the breast of the usurer, and the dreaded President of the Tribunal was no more. CHAPTER X. THE ROBBERY AND DISCOVERY. The night following the incidents of the preceeding chapter, two fashionably dressed young men were conversing in a retired room of an hostel well known in Venice, at the time of our tale, as the \"Inn of the Golden Grape.\" It stood on the broad quay Orfano, and was the favourite lesort of the young nobles and higher ranks, as its wines, edibles, smoking-reeds, and accommodations were said to be superior to those of any other hostel in Italy. A round table was be/ore them, on which two large waxen tapers burned, throwing a bright light on the spangled and jewelled gear of the gallants, as they quaffed their goblets of generous grape, during their whispered speech. '\u2022 1 tell thee, Leon, no harm can possibly come of it ; we proceed with despatch and secrecy,'' said the taller of the two, in a low, cautious voice, and draining his cup of its mellow y juice."], [50, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 40 \" But we need more help,\" responded his companion, half falteringly : \" if we should be surprised \" \" We need not be surprised,\" persisted tiio former, earnestly ; \" if we but take tbe proper hour, and use sufficient precaution, neither noise nor scuffle shall ensue. What need, then, of other confederates, to w.bom we must allow an equal share of the spoil ? Besides, how know we that they would keep their own counsel, after the deed ? They might betray us, and then shame and ruin would be our portion. No \u2014 no ! we must have no more sharers in i.hat rich booty There will be none too much \u2014 even though there should be a thousand times more than I suspect \u2014 in his strong box. Besides think of the girl \u2014 for, despite what I have said, I clo not believe she is yet wedded to the old man \u2014 is there not joy, rapture, more than bliss in that thought ? Speak, shall we hazard it ?\" \" I care not if we do,\" replied the other, slowly, \" provided thou art certain there is no danger in the attempt , and that, after the usurer is dead, thou wilt share fairly in the monies and jewels.\" \" I pledge myself to as much. Is it a bargain ?\" \"It is.\" replied his companion, giving him hia hand. At this moment, the door ofthe chamber opened, and a young fashionable pre sented himself to the eyes ofthe plotters. \" Ha! Lorenzo, my gay madcap,\" exclaimed the first speaker, his sober counte nance changing, all at once, to the loysterer's careless smile, \" I give thee good even! What circumstance indebts us for thy most welcome company!\" \"Have ye heard the news?\" said the new comer, 'seating (himself, and clear ing his throat with a draught of the tempting juice before him. \" In good sooth ! not I,\" replied the roue, \"I, for one, am no newsmonger. But to what do you allude?\" \"The usurer \u2014 the life of tbe money, mart \u2014 has not been seen 'on change' to day.\" \"Indeed! The reason?\" \" 1 have not heard. Some supposehim ill\u2014 others, that he is engaged in forming a contract with the devil how to get all the currency of Venice in his3grasp.

Why my merry hearts,\" he continued, re-filling his cup, a-;d emptying it at a swallow/as if to quiet the restlessness which had seized upon his nerves by the intelligence brought by Lorenzo, \" do ye not recollect how, some ten or twelve years agone the old wretch was absent from the mart two.whole days ; that, when he returned how desperatelely he plunged into thestocks.'outbidding all, till it seemed as if he' meant to buy up all Venice ?

They passed through the hostel, laughing, and nodding carelessly to those whom they met. They walked on, in silence, each busy with his thoughts, till they reached an unfrequented part ofthe quay. \" Hold'st thou still thy mind V said Leon, breaking the silence. \"Listen, and then judge,\" replied the other, with great coolness. \"For the ast eight months I have run out, in extravagance, upwards of four thousand No. 6."], [52, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF V ENICE. 42 ducats ; a thousand of which was furnished me by my father. The rest was ob tained partly fiom thc usurer, and partly from friends who must be paid. Most of the money falls due within a week, or my credit is lost. The notes held against me by the usurer I care not a straw for, as I do not mean to pay them ; and he dare not seize upon me, partly because I am son to the first man of Venice, and partly because he is aware ofa secret of his in my possession, which might harm him, if revealed.

A haughty s\u21221'*-* hovend round his lip, and a slight blue shade was visible under his eye. His whole aspect was terrible. His companion, who, so far as his means and prospects vere concerned, was scarcely a jnt better off, surveyed him, a moment, with awe. But as his nature was not i.bove temptation \u2014 as he loved pleasure, and cared but little for honesty, when she interfered With his dearer mistress, pleasure, \u2014 as, moreover, he bad been for years, the boon companion and co-mate ol Leonardo Foscari, in all his scenes of dissipation, \u2014 his awe 60on ga\\e way to impatience, and he flattered the bent ofthe young lord by exclaiming \u2014 \" Time wanes ; let us on !\" \"So be it!\" replied Foscari, laconically. They pa<;9ed on. A few minutes of travel brought them to the street in which the usurer's house was situated. Everything seemed to favor their purpose. The street was silent and, apparently, deserted. The moonbeams shone on the side opposite the house they were about to enter, and the house itself was shaded. Were not their pros pects bright P They neaied the door, and paused. Were they conscience-stricken ? Lo! they are masked. And now they press against the door, gently at first \u2014 anon, heavily. In lain: il yields not. A ihoUght strikes the noble \u2014 he whi.-pers to his companion, aud they leave the door. The house beside the usurer's is old, tenantless, and ruinous. They press against its door\u2014 it yields, and no*, they are in darkness. Hark ! voices are beard \u2014 low, confused, but still voices, aye, and human as their own. The sound of pickaxe and spade as they clash against each other, or strike into the earth, is heard. A faint gleam, like unto that of the solitary star sometimes seen in the heavily-curtained sky, at night, stole through a crevice in the floor Foscari bent over the spot, and, with his dirk, widened the crevice. Tbe sounds now were plainer, but naught was visible, save the torch-gleam. Foscari groped round the floor cautiously. Joy! his fingers touch an iron rinir. A trap-door is in his grasp \u2014 'tiB raised \u2014 and now \u2014 ! His eyes fall on a tableau that turns his naturally strong nerves into wavering reeds. In was a strange and startling picture. The vault was lit by a huge, flaming torch, which, iesting in the earth, near a pile of fresh dug earth, threw a broad brilliant glare around the terrific scene. Standing in a grave, and holding in his hand a fleshless skull, stood a m, sked figure, in the guise of a gondolier. A few feet from him, his left hand resting on the edge of a new made and open coffin which was muunted on a pair of cress-legged stools, stood another in the same garb and masked. Behind the latter, and near the coffin's foot, stood a tall jestic personage, enveloped in a mask and c oak, and wearing a low- crowned cir cular cap, sui mounted by a cluster of ravin plumes; while, at the side of the grave, his lelt hand holding a white waxen taper, and his left a long, slender ero <! stood a monk, also mar-ked and cloaked. As the skull was raised by the figure f the grave, the form of the capped figure was seen to tremble and turn away a8 if"], [53, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE, 43 shaken by some internal agony \u2014 but no word-no sigh, no groan escaped him ; his gvief was not for other's eyes. The grave-digger, after a moment's survey of the skull, handed it, silently, to the figure on his right, by whom it was laid silently iuto the coffin. Plying again his pickaxe and spade, the figure in the grave soon drew forth a few half decayed bones, which were also placed in silence. In the coffin. \" They are all there,\" said the figure, now leaping out of the chasm, and with the other counting the relics ofthe dead. \" They are,\" added he to whom the bones had been handed, arranging them in the shroud. \" Then, children,\" said the monk, advancing, \"let us (o prayer.\" On the bare eartii they knell, that little and solemn group ; their caps off, and their heads bent, and their hands clasped in holy and heart-feeling prayer. The holy words were o'er ; all rose, but that lone form whose heart wjis bent the most; whose cheek was palest, whose eyes most dim with tears\u2014 the loftiest, the bravest, the proudest, the noblest of them all.\u2014 From his pocket the monk drew forth a phial, containing holy water, and sprinkled the relics. Then opening his missal, read the prayers of his church for the dead ; which, being done, the water w;rs again sprinkled over the bones. The ceremonies being concluded, the most thrilling one to the noble youth at the foot of the coffin, novv presented itself; it was the closing and screwing of the coffin lid. During its operation, he rose from his kcees, aud leaning against an upright beam, near the staircase, gave vent to his o'ercharged heart, in a stream of mournful tears. The lid was closed \u2014 the last screw rivetted into the wood -when one ofthe figures drew from a sack, a black velvet pall, and threw it over the coffin. The noble resumed his stern bearing \u2014 the gondoliers raised the bier upon their shoulders \u2014 the monk seized the torch from its niche in the earth, and thus, the noble leading in silent procession, they ascended the staircase, and the vault was in darkness. The hall was reached \u2014 thr. door opened, and, slowly and so'emnly, the party marched forth. A few stragglers, fresh \"rom scenes of mirth and vice, were passing up the pave, singing snatches of low, lewd songs; but their minh was cheeked by the strange and sudden sight. On beholding the priest, as he marched in the rear, with crjss in one hand and the flaming torch in the other, their voices were hushed, and doffing their caps, bent their heads till the procession was passed and beyond their sight. The moonbeams shone on tbe jetty pall, as it was borne to the t^uay Mazolio, a few yards from the usurer's house, and the stars looked bright as it was placed carefully in the gondola, which was to bear it to the ancestral vault ofthe Galliano family. The noble seated himself sternly at the helm*\u2014 the bier rested lengthwise, o.n a bench, brought for the purpose, in the centre of the boat\u2014 the monk took his station forward \u2014 the gondoliers taking their seats near the stern, rai ed their oars, and the next moment the little barge was gliding rapidly over tie smooth waters, in the direction of a little island, where stood a mansion, towering above the rest, kpown as the home ofthe Gallianos. Return we, now, to the watchers. Foscari understood at once the meaning of the ceremonies attendant on the disinterment, and in the form of the masked stranger recognised the favourite of the metropolis, and his once beloved friend. His companion was not so fortunate in comprehending the scene, but Foscari enabled him to gather enough to form a dim conception of its mean'ng, bv pretended conjectures and exclamations. The darkness was no obstacle to Foscari, for he well knew, by repeated visits to the house, where to find appliances to furnish him a light, and, leaping down into the vault, groped his way to the staircase. Ascending, and searching an apartment iu the rear of the house, he found box, flint and tinder, by which he as soon in possession of a light. A portable lamp, with three small burners"], [54, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 44 stood on a mantle before him, and touching the igniting wick, he was soon in pos session of light enough to guide him back to the vault. \" Thou may'st spring,\" he exclaimed, to his companion, and holding the lamp under the trap. Leon leaped down, and for the first time, the horeful youths bad a full view of the objects around them. In one corner, cold and stiff, and gory, lay the body of the usurer ; his glassy eyes staring full upon them ; while at the foot of the stair- case, as if he had fallen headlong from thc top, lay the corpse of the gigantic black\u2014 its features betraying the last agonies of death. The youths started at the sight, and Foscari exclaimed, \u2014 \" By St. Peter ! there has been foul murder here. It would be well to inform the authorities of the matter ; what thinkest thou of it ?\" \" We had better see if his money bags have been jilted of life also,\" answered Leon, nervously. \"Right, business first \u2014 pleasure afterwards,\" responded Foscari, laughing. \" Let us examine yonder arch, perhaps, as the doors are fast, they have neglected to add theft to their crime.\" They proceeded to the first of the arches, but were somewhat staggered on finding no means of opening it, as the lock was on the inside. They then adranced to the next, and to the next, but the same unpleasant sight greeted them at each. '\u2022Where, in Satan's name, is the master-key of these treasure caves,\" said Fos cari, impetuously, and glancing uneasily around. \" The girdle of the black,\" said Leon suggestively. \" Psha !\" exclaimed the other, contemptuously, \" think 'st thou the cunning gray-bPard silly enough to trust the magic key of his whole wealth to that foul carcase V More likely his own breast.\" \" Then, try, thou that,\" responded Leon, \" while I examine the mute.\" \"So be it,\" said Foscari, hastily, and advancing towards the corse of the usurer. \" 'Tis not here,\" said he impatiently. \" But 'lis here,\" cried Leon, joyfully, holding up a bunch of cunningly-devised keys, which he cut from the leathern girdle of the mute. After several attempts, Foscari succeeded at last, in hitting on the right key, and in opening the first arch. But, nothing but shelves of parchment met their gaze. Giving vent to his disappointment in an oath, the roue proceeded to open the next, but with no better success. The third and fourth arches were opened, and found to contain little packages, evidently pledges, ot rings, and jewels of considerable amount. \" Cospetto !\" exclaimed Foscari, \" but the knaves have left us something, after all. Here,\" and he handed handful, after handful to his companion, after having filled bis own pockets first. \"But the gold itself,\" he added, impatiently, \"I must have that. This trash may do for those who want it.\" He did not, however, disencumber himself of what he had already in his pos session The fifth arch was opened, and then what a sight greeted his gaping eyes. On broad shelves, extending from side to side of the arch, lay heaped piles of glitteiiog coin. \" Ho, ho ! my merry heart.' he exclaimed rapturously, to his companion, who was busily engaged in helping himself to the little packages in the next cell, what thinkest thou of this ? Is it not a feast to the hungry. Look.\" Bnt he gave Leon little chance for sight, he commenced filling his own pockets with the tempting food. Leon exerted his utmost to grasp the golden coin, but so violently did Foscari repulse him, so eagerly did the roue seek to clutch it all, that he had but a small prospect of reaching any without a struggle. Desperate at the rapacity of his companion, and eager to seize upon a pile of ducats on the third shelf, he vio-"], [55, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 45 lenlly thrust the hand of Foscari aside, and, in the struggle, the stirred shelf gave way, and down tumbled coin, shelf and all upon their heads. A bag of gold of considerable weight, concealed behind some piles of ducats, fel with them, and with such force that, striking the young lord on the breast in its descent, it felled him to the earth, where he was soon covered with the coin swept from the shelves by Foscari. When the greediness and rapacity of the latter had somewhat abated, he exclaimed, \u2014 \" Now, Leon, take thy share, and let us be gone.\" But Leon answered not. '\u25a0 Leon !\" he exclaimed, looking around, \" Leon, where art thou ? ' No answer came. Springing over the heap of treasure before him, his heel grazed something fleshy beneath him, and immediately after a sharp cry rang through the vault, and all was silent. Half suspecting the actual state of things, Foscari hastily flung the heap aside, and, to his horror, discovered a gash on the head of his companion, and his face and neck all covered with blood. \"Great Heavens!\" he exclaimed, recoiling, \"have I slain him! Leon! Leon!\" No voice responded to his own. i \"Leon, 'tis I ; for Heaven's sake speak.\" No answer came from the lips of the prostrate man. Foscati knelt, and placed his hand upon the heart of his friend \u2014 it was still. Cold sweat rolled down the cheeks and limbs of the ro ie on this discovery, his knees trembled and his eyes grew moist. Flt a few mom nts, terror unnerved him and the finger of a child might have robbed him of his balance. Thought then came to bis aid, and he was himself again. In that dark vault, where death reign ed over three ghastly subjects \u2014 in that dark vault, where mammom yawned from his glittering cave \u2014 in that dark vault, with the lifeof earth before him \u2014 and three pictures of the king of terrors around him ; in that vault where fate seemed to level her shafts unerringly on all who entered it \u2014 in that vault of darkness and mammon, and death and terror, the strong heart of Leonardo Foscari did not desert him. He seized the spade, and, like a ceaseless and fearless worker, threw up the earth, till a hole of sufficient size to suit his purpose was made, when he flung the body of his late companion in, and covered him with the soil. Having filled up the gap, and strewed the superfluous earth around, to hide the evidence of his crime, he shovelled the treasure back into the cell, yea, every coin, fastened each arch, and, with his pockets sinking with his ill-gotten gold, dep rtedfrom the house. As he closed the outer door, he beheld two muffled and masked figures on the opposite side of the street. But careless of, or indifferent to, aught in the shape of danger, he passed on, regardless of their presence. \u2022' 'Tis my mine,\" he muttered, \" from whose depths I shall, henceforth, draw mine income. The master-key of the cells is in my possession, the house door secret spring is known to me, and the entrance to the vault through the crazy cot known tome alone. A week must elapse ere the suspicions of the \"Ten\" are aroused, during which time, those arches must be emptied, and then, what care I how soon the bodies are discovered ? They are not roy work. Bnt for Leon, the fool, his greediness brought his doom upon himself, I had no hand in't. Ere a week expires the earth around his grave will have lost its freshness, and then who willsuspect aught lies beneath other than common soil ? But if they do ? Wha then I murdered him not, 'twas an ill-timed accident, no more. Psha, I am reasoning myself into an assassin. Ha ! ha ! ha!\" He laughed, but it was a faint laugh. He journeyed home, and, as he sat beside his gay couch, he counted the gajns of his crime. A smile played aiound hi3 features. Wine was within his reach\u2014 1 e d1 ank, and the coin beiore him repaid him amply for his guilt."], [56, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 46 Hiding the gold in his dressing-ease, he wooed sleep. But did it come ? Hath guilt a charter to refreshing, balmy slumber? As the grey dawn first peeped through the lattice of his rhamber, sleep threw her folds over his physical orbs. But his mental vision\u2014 the conscience\u2014 slumbered that ? CHAPTER XI. THE HOUSE OF MOIRN1N*?. Ere yet the dial had told the hour of nine on the succeeding morn, the few domestics of the house of Galliano were assembled in the old reception Ball, to witness the last sad rites of \" holy church\" over the ashes ofthe dead. The bier stood in the centre of the chamber, upon two mounted stools, around wl ich on little circular tables, waxen tapers gleamed. A priest sat by tbe coffin, leading bis breviary in silence, while the parties who were priviledged to attend the service, were gathering. Two young females in deep mourning, sat together on a cushion of a muffled bench near the reverend man, while the few friends of the young lord of Galliano sat on muffled chairs in promiscuous groups around the bier. The young lord himself soon entered, attired in a suit of mourning, and took a seat at the foot of the bier. He shed no tears, but his features bore those unmistakeable traces of true grief, wbich command more attention than even tears; and, as bis large dark eyes fell sadly on the pall, every eye was moistened, every heart was touched in sympathy. There was a nobleness in his tearless eye, a majesty in his colourless cheek, yea, a solemnity on his pale, nervous brow which struck the assembled auditors with pity, and produced in each a willin-' readiness to die in his defence, if such sacrifice was necessary. There was scarce a being in that chamber who had not. within the past few months, felt the blessings either of his courage or his purse ; and there wus not one but knew his love of right, his ardour as a patriot and a man, his noble ness of soul under every situation, and willingness to bai lie even for the most friend less in the ho ir oi danger. Yet in his grief \u2014 iu that hour when he mourned over the new found relics of his murdered father \u2014 who could give him consolation? His mother had long since taken her place amid the ashes of the kindred of her lord \u2014 he was motherless. His father's bones novv rested in their cerements \u2014 he was fatherless. His only brother had sunk into the tomb in early youth, when the worm ot that fell destroyer of the fair and beautiful \u2014 consumption\u2014 had eaten up his heart he -was brotherless. His fair and angelic sister had pined and sickened, and died on tbe loss of her father \u2014 the young lord of Galliano was, in view of all the world, kinless. Unknown to the Tribunal, he returned to Venice, and now, in his ancestral halls was sole heir to his ancestral name, and mourner over his father's dust ! The sol.mn rites of the holy church weie now performed \u2014 and the remains of the,r.oblest of Venetian r obles were borhe, with measured step and solemn into the f.rmily vault, and placed among the ashe__ of its kindred. The rites were o'er; the guests returned to their homes, and the only pilhr of the Galliano house retired to his chamber to glean that repose which the exdtlhe incidents of the past three days had rendered doubly imperative."], [57, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 47 CHAPTER XII. THE HOUSE OF CONCEALMENT. An humble dwelling, in a retired quarter of Venice, was Mastachio Benedetti's ; and a merry heart Was Benedetti's; and a merry dame was Madame Benedetti; and a merry maid was Junetta, the daughter of these Benedettis. Benedetti was a respectable citizen ; Madame Benedetti was a respectable wo- man, and a respectable citizen's wife ; and Junetta Benedetti, being the daughter of two such merry and respectable people, was, of course, a very merry and a very respectable girl herself. But it is a dangerous thing for the young of the sterner sex, when a young lady of respectable parentage has found such qualifications to recommend her as respectability, wealth, merry-heartedness and beauty, because such tbing3 are apt to engross their attention, rob them of their sternness, and render them love-sick : i. e. tender. When a youth is once touched with the disease commonly nicknamed love, he degenerates in dignity and manliness, until he becomes the veriest bondman imagination can picture. With his love a change comes over his mental and physical parts, which has every thing but dignity in it ; and it is not until he is either noosed or loosed, that he recovers his former manly nature. The fact is, while the love fever is on him, a man is a sort of pliant sap- ling ; and the ooject of his affections a sort of ladle, whose coquettry draws from him the greater part of the natural sap in his cranium. When he is knotted, he begins to get an insight of the real state of things around him. Romance is very deceptive ; and until matrimony sweeps it aside, man is a laughable and ridiculous animal. The gentle sex understand this fact intuitively, and, through life, man is their victim \u2014 tieir play-thing: in view of which facts, we wonder where man's charter is for predominancy. These thoughs ran through the mind of Junetta, as she beheld, from day to day, how perfectly her beloved mother led her beloved husband round the matrimonial circle , and, as She fancied her mother's system of domestic government, she had made up her mind to run a cord through the nostrils of her beloved, whoever he might be, and lead him into obedience in th? same masterly manner. But, some- how, or another, the youth whom, out of all her admirers, she esteemed the most, looked very like one who would stand but little of this kind of government. His features and general hearing bore the impress of one born to command, not those of one born to be led. At least, so Junetta thought, and she sighed as she pon- dered over it. Now, when a young maiden sighs over the result of thought, it is a pretty good evidence that she is diseased around the heart ; and that that disease is the result of too much thought upon the object that created it. A young man, whose features proclaimed his recent entrance into manhood, knocked gently at the door ol the Benedettis. It was opened by a servant, and the youth, as if accustomed to the house, nodded familiarly to the servitor, and entered the sitting room witaout ceremony. When a youth is as far advanced as this, he is in a dangerous state indeed ; for he even forgets politeness. \" I am sure you might have knocb d Messer. Calvari,\" said Junetta, starting up \u2022n coqettish confusion, as though she had not seen him, through the curtained window, ere he km eked at the door. \" Indeed, my pretty lady.\" replied Messer Calvari, \"so I might, if my head had not been so filLd wiih thoughts of a certiin young lady.\" \" To whom does Messer Calvari allude?\" inquired Junetta earnestly, as though not aware, in the slightest of who that certain young lady could be."], [58, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 48 He took her hand in his\u2014 he turned his eyes on her's \u2014 he twined his arms around her waist \u2014 he drew her close to his breast \u2014 he put his lips to her's \u2014 and he gave her to understand that way to whom he alluded. Junetta appearod to be satisfied with the reply. This introductory busines fineshed, Messer Calvari inquired if one Eugenia and a certain lady Isabel were visible. Junetta pouted, as if jealous at the interrogatory. \" Nay, my beloved, 1 bear a message to them, from a gentlemau in whose fate they are interested : and I have promised to use despatch,\" said the youth earnestly. \"But do tel! me what all this mystery means, Calvari,\" said Junetta, inqui sitively, \" I can't bear to live in suspense. Do tell me who and what these strange ladies are, and who that strange man is that brought them here. \" Thou would'st not have thy Calvari forfeit his honor by a breach of faith, wou 'st thou, Junetta?\" inquired the youth, earnestly. \"What, there is a mystery about them then? I knew there was, from the stange manner in which they were brought here by that Messer Galliano In the night he brought them \u2014 in the dead of the night \u2014 and I knew nothing o heir presence till I met them at breakfast. Father, nor mother, would tell me tany thing about them ; and, moreover, enjoined me not to speak a word about them in the presence of strangers, on any account. I declare its a shame! so it is, that any modest and well behaved girl can't be admitted into a share of secret atters, as well as any one else !\" And the coquettish beauty appeared to be very indignant at her cruel treat ment. \" And of course Junetta has not periled the safety of the unhappy ladies under ber father's roof by disobeying her parents?'' inquired the youth earnestly and tenderley taking her hand. Junetta gazed fondly upon him, as she responded smiling, \u2014 \" Junetta loves her parents too much to permit any rash and idle curiosity of her's to bring them misery, or mar the happiness or safety of others. But,\" she continued in love's tone of tender reproach, \"how comes it thou <ioM play the truant from thy Junetta so much of late ?\" \" My studies \" \"Thy studies indeed ! As if they were so important to the world ! Ha! ha! ha! You used to come and take me out on the lagoons every fair moonlight, and compare my eyes to the bright stars, my brow to the snowy clouds, my cheeks and lips to the blushing rose, and my hair to the locks of an elfin. But now if I see thee once a week, 'tis wonderful ; and even then, thou never comest, unless on some such message as to-night, to these fair and unhappy ladies. It is not fair, Besides, how dost thou know how thine absence may operate against thee, if thou persist in this unloving course ? Are not our doors besieged, nightly, by brave and goodly formed gallants \u2014 and is it not possible that one of them\u2014 I need not say which\u2014 might steal away my heart without my knowing it ? Stranger things than that have happened. Thy allegiance to thy lady love demands a constant at tendance, and look that she exact it not !'' \" Hast thou done, Junetta?\" \" No, I have not done. Thou must pay me more attention, or I shall cut thee off from my savour.\" \" Must is a hard word, Junetta.\" \"I cannot help it.

Now lead me to the chamber of your fair prisoners : for what I have to deliver to them is of importance.\" \" Then tarry a moment, till I inform them of your arrival.\" She soon returned, and bade the student follow her. The back chamber on the second floor was closely curtained, and neatly furnished with white and red matting, three or four cushioned chairs, a picture of the virgin over the mantel, a guitar in one corner, a lute and a small circular table. The females were sitting beside each other, their arms around each other's waists, when our student entered, Junetta, after opening the dooi, immediately withdrew. The student bowing, advanced and handed the Lady Isabel a small leaf of parchment, neatly folded, saying, \u2014 \" This.ifrom the Messer Galliano to the Lady Isabel ; and this, from the Messer Genaro, to his beloved, the fair Eugenia.\" He gave an ivory cross to the orange girl. Isabel opened the note, it ran Beloved of my soul\u2014 these line? to thee, in haste, greeting : \"The hour when our country shall be freed from her oppressors rapidly approaches.

The latter, though well acquainted with Eugenia's historv, was too much of a novice in the study of woman, not to be surprised at this movement on her part, but he had the presence of mind enough to conceal its effect upon him. Eugenia, bursting into tears, exclaimed, \u2014 \" What should I do, lady?\" \" Give him a token,\" replied Isabel, smiling, \" but send notback his own. Thy ring for instance, or something that thou dost prize, and so prove thy willingness to make a sacrifice for the returning of his good opinion.\" Eugenia had a little golden cross around her neck, which she had worn since childhood. She gave it to the student, and, with an agitated voice, said, \u2014 \" Give him this \u2014 'tis all 1 have \u2014 but he will know how deeply I do prize it.\" She wore it in her days of innocence, ere yet the brand of shame was emblazoned on her brow. It was the only relic of her happier days. Was it a wonder, then, sbe sighed ob parting with it ? '' No word, no cheering sentence, to send with it ?'' said the student, interro gatively. \" Tell him, Eugenia is grateful for his fidelity,'' replied the orange girl, in a tremulous voice, and with downcast eyes. \"A world is in that sentence,\" said the student, smiling respectfully. \" Adieu !\" \" Think'st thou he can love me?\" asked the poor girl, when they were alone. '' Think'st thou\u2014 knowing as he does my shame \u2014 think's thou he can love me?\" \" If he be human, and aware of the vile aits by which Foscari first entrapped thy guiltless and too confiding heart, \u2014 if he is yet aware of thy sorrow, thy re pentence, thy trials and thy persecutions \u2014 if he ever loved thee, I say, and his heart still be human, fear not but his re-proffered love is honest as his first.\" \" But, lady, if thy case were mine \u2014 if thou hadst been lured away from virtue's path as 1 have been \u2014 if thy soft heart had been ensnared and wronged, as mine has been \u2014 if, after the shame, thou hadst awoke to sense and misery, \u2014 if, knowing the nobleness of the heart you forsook, he, forgiving your great fault, should offer you again his hand and home and honoured name, \u2014 wouldst thou forget thine own sense of right, the world's sneer upon thy former shame, and his weakness in affiancing thee in thy shame \u2014 wouldst thou so outrage his name as to accept bis new loyalty through thy short stay on earth ?' Isabel pondered a while with a pale cheekand throbbing heart, as the timid eye of the orange girl rested on her ; then, without raising he* eyes, replied, nervously,-- \" No, so help me. Heaven! I would not!\" \" I thought so \u2014 I knew so !\" murmured the broken-hearted girl, sinking back in her seat. That night was one of tears. CHAPTER XII. THE MEETING. The moon and stars shone brightly in the heavens ; the sky was like a blue arch he?e and there dotted with specks of snowy clouds. The air, after a sultry day was cool and refreshing to those within and without. The proclamation of aay, was iu*j | all the children of earth\u2014 \"Night reigns; c^asTyor til ' N?*\u00a3 kerned Vinvite thc house-dwellers forth, that in the rich and beautiful combination of the beautious sky, the silver night orb, the"], [62, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 52 bright and silent stats, the murmuring waters and the pellucid air, they migh enjoy a foretaste of thc Paradise of the holy. A white-haired man, of the middle height, with a proud step and a noble mien, was pacing the marble pave in front of thc ducal palace, and surveying the lofty pile of St. Mark's. His eye was large, dark, and bright ; his forehead was high, full and slightly wrinkled; his nose was ofthe Roman mould, and his ltp was small, and spoke much for i*s owner's firmness and decision ; his chin was bold and pointed ; he wore a small moustache and beard, and they gave to his features a venerable and sage-like expression. He was cloaked, as much to hide his cos tume as to prevent thc effects of the night, air upon his person. This was Foscari, the Doge of Venice. It was his custom thus to traverse the pave, fronting his palace, on pleasant nights, and no particular object, other than the beauty and calmness of the evening, called him forth on the evening in question. But it was not his custom to turn his eyes so frequently and so earnestly on one spot during these short wanderings. A strange form, cloaked and masked, and majestic as the pile itself, stood, in stern dignity, in the shade of the broad door of the entrance of tbe temple of St. Mark. A jetty cap, with a heavy clustre of plumes of the same colour, adorned his head. He stood there as motionless as a block of marble, contemplating, ap parently, the motions of the duke. Was he a spy ? The duke was hated by the \" Ten \" \u2014 feared for his impartial decisions in matter pertaining to justice, and his fearlessness in ao vocating and maintaining the rights of the poor against the insolence and tyranny of the rich and the noble \u2014 hated equally by the poor, because he spared no caste in his ad ministration of the laws. Was the stranger a spy ? If not, was he an assassin, awaiting the moment when the duke's back should be toward him, that he might plunge the cowardly steel, unseen, into the spine of his victim ? In either case, the duke had nothing to fear ; for his private guards stood on the steps of his palace, and within call at any moment, when he choose to summon them. The moonlight was no favourer of murder, if that was the stranger's object. The duke, to settle all uneasiness and gratify his curiosity, watched the moment, when the pave was clear of the throng passing to and fro the front of the palace, :md walked slowly towards the door of the temple. The figure budged not at his approach. \" AVho art thou ?\" said the duke, when within a few paces of the stranger. \" A man,\" was the reply. \"Thy business here?\" \"To feed my humour '\u25a0\" \" Less pertness and more politeness would better become thyself and me. Whose knave art thou?\" \"Mine own.\" \" It would seem so, indeed, from,the licence which thou givest thy tongue. What charter hast thou for standing in the portals of St. Mark's ?\" \" Every true Venetian's.\" '\u2022'_ SS ! 't0?, Usest stranSe language, Messer Braggart.

II till now, thy tongue hath spoke no falsehood, on peril of thy soul, chase not thy angels from thee !\" \" What meanest thou ?\" \" 'Twixt thee and me there is a current of tell-tale air, which, as Venetian ethet is dangerous to trust, might peril my safety, if my speeeh were in unison with my thoughts ; if thou wilt step into this shade, or go with me where our converse can be free and dangerless, I will open my mind to thee.\" \"What if I object?\" \" Thou canst, if 'tis thy humour ; but if thou dost, the thing concerning which I would speak to thee will remain unsaid \u2014 perchance to thy sorrow and mine !\" \" Strange man ! there is a mystery in thy speech and bearing, which doth tell me there is a connecting tie between thy fate and mine. Follow me : and fear not.\" The duke led the way, through a private door, and into the palace. It was a pleasant room for converse they entered. It was the private chamber of tbe duke, and situated in the rear of the marbl\u00ab pile, and looked out upon the broad sheet of the moonlit Adriatic. The casements, of which there were five \u2014 were furnished in the most gorgeous style of the middle ages. The walls were hid by heavy arras of blue and crimson velvet; and on one side, the ducal bed stood prominent, ornamented with gold and aiiure : beside it, the easy chair in which the reverend noble sat and meditated when released from the cares and troubles of his office. A few feet from it was a small marble altar, whose top was garnished by a silver crucifix ; in front of this, a low cushion, on which the old man knelt at morning, noon, and night, while offering up his prayers. A silver burner, rested on a toilet table of polished oak, between two windows. The floor was covered with a soft matting, ingeniously figured to represent the mosaic pave of a palace hall. \" Be seated,\" said the duke, on entering, and pointing to a high cushion near his favourite chair. The mask obeyed. \" Now, to thy business,\" said the duke, seating himself. \"To what doth it relate ?'* \" Thy son,\" replied the stranger, laconically. \" Indeed I \u2014 a new subject I Say on.\" \" He hath wronged a confiding heart \u2014 broken it\u2014 sundered it from all its ties"], [64, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE 54 and kindred \u2014 blasted its hopes and prospects \u2014 cut it off from all its earthly joys and the sunny days which, ere his presence blighted, promised a harvest.\" \"Her name?\" \" Eugenia.\" \" Her rank ?\" \" Ofthe fourth caste.\" 'Has she kindred ?\" \" She had \u2014 his crime sundered her from them.\" \" Her age when wronged ?\" \" Sixteen.\" \" So, so !

I would not in my travels allow a taint upon his nameto'pass unvindicated or unpunished. I fought for him when a boy, and in his wars with the Turks have borne his royal banner through seas of blood and carnage ; have ever loved him as a father ; reve rence him still, and would not let his glorious fame pass on to posterity blemished by his son. I would have him vindicate his fame and name when assailed by his dear est kin, as well as when attacked by those foreign to his eye and heart.

But she cannot live : for the worm, created by his hand, hath eaten up her heart \u2014 and she is nigh unto death. Do her sorrows justice, then, O duke ; lether not die with the blight upon her name and soul for ever ! Do it, and the prayers of her kindred, the prayers of ber friends, yea, the players of the poor victim herself shall be recorded by thy name on the archangel's record when thy soul seeketh for entrance into heaven !\" The duke pondered. \" What if my son refuse ?\" he asked, after a pause. \" Thou art his father,\" was the meaning response."], [65, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 55 \" Thou dost not know him,\" said the doge with a sigh. \" He does not!\" exclaimed a voice behind the arras. The doge started, and coloured to the temples. The next moment, Leonardo Foscari stood before them. \" Thou hast overheard us, then ?\" said the duke angrily ; \" thou hast been play ing the eaves-dropper. Shame on thee, son !\" \" Nay, shame on thee, father,\" responded Leonardo, coolly, \" who couldst give audience to the vituperation heaped upon thy son by yon vile slanderer !\" \" 'Tis well thou art in thy father's presence and 'neath thy father 's roof, \" said the mask, sternly, \" or thy base throat and degenerate heart should answer for thine insolence : as it is, 1 have no answer for thee other than scorn.\" \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the other, mockingly, \"then a time will come when we shall hold converse in terms more in consonance with our rank.\" \" Cease these idle threats,\" cried the duke, indignantly'. \"Go, myson \u2014 that I should call an eaves-dropper a son of mine ! \u2014 go hence, till my conference is ended with this stranger. When he is gone, I shall summon thee, and look that thou be ready.\" \"But father\u2014\" \" Not a word, I charge thee. Go, and play not the spy again upon thy sire's privacy, or a doom thou little dreamest of, shall be visited upon thee.\" Leonardo obeyed, with scowling brow, and wrathful step. \" Said 1 not thou didst not know my son ?\" said the duke, in a somewhat piqued tone. \"Thou saidst truly,\" rejoined the mask ; \" and I dare venture to assert your lordship hath never, till this hour, known how far his presumption could lead him from that manly path which honour hath ordained.'' \"I confess as much,\" returned the duke, testily ; \"and were it not for pity of his youth, T should have chastised his insolence on the spot. But enough of him ; return we now to his victim.\" \" Which one, my lord ?\" The duke glanced at the questioner \u2014 but the mask shrank not from his eye. '\" Which one? Hath he wronged more that one?\" \" That question, my lord, argues thy little knowledge of thy son. What would your highness think should I prove him a murderer and a thief, as well as a seducer ?\" The duke turned pale and gasped. \"Saidst thou ? \u2014 \" he muttered, feebly. \" A spy, too, on his father's every word and act\u2014a liar, and \" The mask paused : for the duke had sainted. The mask started back in confusion at his critical position, scarce knowing what to do. His eye fell on a small silver bell, standing on the altar. He rang it, and, a moment afterwards, a servant entered the apartment. \" Water, sirrah.-ic haste,\" cried the mask ; \" for lo ! the doge hath fainted.\" The servitor rushed out ; as if he had heard the order \u2014 as if it had recalled him to consciousness, Foscari raised his eyes feebly, till they encountered his com panion. \" Stay,\" he muttered, \"what need of alarming the knaves for trifles? 'Twas but a slight touch of the weakness of age ; but Heaven preserve me from them in future ! Another such, and this beating pulse would soon be still. Tell me all \u2014 stay.\" A host of servitors were now in the apartment. \" Beware, knaves !\" he cried, angrily ; \" and wait till ye are summoned.\" They departed in confusion. \" Tell me all,\" he repeated, addressing the mask ; \" tell me all, and spare not ; thou seest how firmly I can bear it, now the first shock of amazement is over. Tell me all\u2014 all thou knowest.\" ff I ljave no more to tell,\" relied the mask ; \" I have given thee the outlines of"], [66, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 56 his character : time will reveal to thee the minutiae. Meanwhile, as the hour grows late, I'll take my leave. But ere I go, a word with your highness : on the night of the coming carnival, leave not thou the palace.\" \" And why not, mysterious man ?\" \" Danger to thy person will then be avoided, your highness. More, I have neither the power nor the inclination to expose. But, as thou valuest thy life, pay heed to my warning.\" \" Explain thy meaning fully, strange man, or I shall summon and bid my ser vants to seize thee as one dangerous.\" \" Summon them,\" said the mask, coldly. \" Art thou so determined, so fearless in thy nature, then ? I implore thee to expound thy strange words,\" \" It would aid thee naught, and jeopardise myself,\" said the mask, with a stern laugh. \".Art thou my foe?\" 1 1 \" Doth my conduct of to-night lead thee to so think, doge ?\" \" Nay, I know not what to think : thy bearing is noble, thy voice manly, but thy conduct inexplicable.\" \" Time will unravel my mystery ; as neither force nor fair speech on thy part can enlighten thee now, take the wise man's alternative\u2014 time \u2014 and put thy faith in't!\" \" Thou dost not hate me ? \" No, doge.\" \" Dost thou love thy country's chief ruler V* \" With a patriot's love, ay. \"And thou dost know of a danger threatening his well-being, and yet concealest it from him ?\" \" I have told thee enough to preserve thee from all danger, if thou but followest my counsel.\" \" What wrong in me, if I should now order thy arrest ?\" \" What wrong, doge ? A foul wrong\u2014 a wrong that would blast thy fame through all time, and do thee not a jot of benefit \u2014 the base and treacherous wrong of in viting a stranger to thy house, and, taking advantage of thy power, robbing him of his chartered liberty. Durst thou do it, duke ? Thou durst not \u2014 it were too vile a deed for one so strictly just.'\" \" Thou art right, strange man \u2014 1 dare not.\" \" I know it \u2014 and, warning thee again not to quit thy palace on the night of the approaching carnival, I take my leave. Farewell!\" \" A word, ere thou goest : Shall we meet again V' \" We shall.\" \" Where ?\" \" E'en there where circumstance shall place us.\" \"Ere long?\" \" Ere long, doge. Shall the wronged girl of whom I spoke be righted ?\" \"If possible, ay.\" \" Without delay ?\" \" As soon as I can prevail on my son to right the wrong.\" \" Wilt thou not compel him, doge?\" *' Thinkst thou he can be compelled ?\" \" The man who, sheltered by small power, doth play the tyrant and the villain can, by a power greater than his own, be compelled to aught\u2014 be it base or godlike ?\" \" That is thy thought }\" \" 'Tis nature, doge.\" \" Thou hsst studied that ?\" \u2022'AU things befitting man to know that can be had for mental labour, kogw J,\" \" I fear me much, thou'rt but a braggart.\" \" Prince are privileged to doubt, and to speak their doubti.\""], [67, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 57 \"\u25a0 Thou art bold, too, as never a man in Venice is bold.\" \" He who would serve the cause of Truth must not enter her ranks with a timid heart.\" \" Thou art a courtier, by thy ready speech.\" \" Courtier I am not, your highness ; but a plain, unpretending man. The airs of court agree not with my humour ; at least those courts that I have seen. There is not enough of God's unpolluted essence sprinkled in their halls. I would not he a courtier, and am none,\" \" Thou art a strange, bold man.\" \" Your highness is at liberty to hold me in your thought as your inclination wills. I have performed mine errand \u2014 warned thee and advised thee ; and so, farewell !\" \"Strange, strange man!\" soliloquized the doge; \"brave and honest, noble and proud, young and wise, \u2014 ah ! whv, why was I not blessed with ason like him !

It shall be trje(j \u2014 my word is pledged, and justice must be done!\" He rang the bell \u2014 a servitor answered it. \"Go, and tell my son, his father awaits his presence.'' The servitor bowed and withdrew. \" I'll have no refusal,\" soliloquized the doge, \" be must consent to right his victim. I've borne his follies till they have ceased to be follies. I'll put up with them no longer. He hath a winning way with him, in excusing his errors ; but I'll be firm now, and insist on his giving them o'er for ever. If be braves me, I'll discard, nay, disinherit him. Iii be tender with him no longer.\" Footsteps were heard in the hall, near the door. \" He comes, but not alone,\" muttered the doge ; \" he fears my reproaches, and therefore comes in company. But I'll be stern and firm with him.\" The door was thrown open rudely, and a huge black, cloaked and capped, and attended by six masked figures in black, entered the chamber. The doge's heart sank, and his cheeks turned pale, and his nerves quivered and his voice trembled, as he demanded of the leader his business. The latter, without a word, placed a sealed packet in his hand. The doge broke the seal, and, with an effort, mastering his agitation, scanned its contents. When its perusal was concluded, the statues fronting his ducal palace, were not more white than he. His voice was subdued, his head bowed low to the dark bearer, as he responded \u2014 \" I am ready \u2014 lead on !\" CHAPTER XIII. THE EFFECTS OF TIIE ARREST. Pass we now three days. The faces of the nobility and citizens of Venice were marked with fear, mis trust, sadness. One might have read their thoughts in their eyes, without hearing a word from their ashy and quivering lips. As if an all-slaying plague were raging through thc streets, the citizens Itept in-doors, fearfully. The marts of trade were deserted, the shops closed, and the churches void of worshippers. Those whom stern necessity drove forth to traffic, did their business in laconic sentences, and downcast eyes, as if an universal edict had been issued, forbidding speech and action. Men met each other in the streets and squares, and, though their acquaintanceship and friendliness were unbroken, yet passed without a word or sign of recognition. A dark cloud seemed to hover over the fair city, although the sun shone glowingly, and the sky was lovely as ever. Doors were closed, windows heavily and closely curtained, as if the stricken ones within feared the eyes of the fear-stricken ones without. One form alone was seen traversing the streets boldly. One form alone, amid the Fear-contagion dared to Stalk through street and square, and look at the right and left, his large dark eye searching every face he met without a moment's quail ing. Pale was his cheek, though ; pale his lip, as he read the Fear in the closed doors and curtained windows and hasty steps and downcast eyes, and caught the laconic and fear-choked vyords of those whose stomachs forced them into traffic."], [69, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 59 Pale was he ! but not with that paleness which marks the wretch whose timidity is caused by fear : but pale with that hue which the strong heart wears when indignation at man's cowardice takes the place of pity. With hasty strides, his good sword hanging boldly at his side, he passed from street to street, from square to square, from quay to quay, from canal to canal, his eyes every moment searching each spot, before, behind and around him, as if in anxious pursuit of some loathed foe, or beloved friend. So passed the day. Night came ; night, with all her beauties and magical influences ; night, with her bright stars, sky drapery and moon, and soft, wooing aii ; night came, and one by one, as if ashamed of their cowardice, the inhabitants of Venice braved the outside of their doors. Still, the silvery laugh rang not in the air, and voices were not heard aloud, as in nights gone by. It appeared as if habit, not the loveliness of the night, brought them forth ; and more like funeral followers they seemed, than beings forth for pleasure, so whispering they spoke. On this night three men, guised as eommon gondoliers, met, as if by accident, at the foot of the quay Zechetti. '' Give thee good even, friend,\" said one, \"art thou fora sail on the lagoon to-night ?'' \" Customers are scarce,\" replied the other ; \" I know not if I shall pull an oar or pocket a piece of the mint.\" \" Nay, rather than pull not for reward, I'll e'en pull for mine own pleasure,\" said the third. \"I like thy spirit, friend,\" said the first, \" and if thou hast no dislike to my company, will join thee at a tug.\" \" So be it, an' thou wilt,\" replied the other, \"I've done nothing to-day, but sleep, and must have exercise. So jump in.\" \"Wilt thou not join us?\" he added, addressing the remaining boatman. \" I care not an' I do,\" responded the other, leaping into the boat. \" Then take thy seat astern,\" said the owner ot the gondola, arranging his oar, \"for, till we are tired, thou can'st not exercise thy skill. Now, then, my merry hearts, let's dive into the breast of our ocean mother, and sing our passage out in the merry strain of our craft. Hast thou thy pocket flute ?\" \" 1 have,\" responded the boatman at the helm. \"Then make the air ring with its tones,\" said the inquirer, \" while we follow thee with our voices.\" They pushed from the quay, and as they rowed forth, the flute led the strain and the ears of those assembled on the quay, caught the following song : ' SONG OF THE GONDOLIER. The night \u2014 the night \u2014 the night, When the sky is calm and clear, The night \u2014 the night \u2014 the night, When the tide and shore are near From the pier I leap, In my boat on the deep ; And with bark all full, To the lagoons I pull, Cheerily! Cheerily! The night \u2014 the night \u2014 the night, When the sky is calm and clear ; The night \u2014 the night \u2014 the night. When the tide and shore are near. \u2014 I'rom the crowded quay, To the deep broad bay, The lover with his love, To my gondola move, Cheerily! Cheerily!"], [70, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 60 The night \u2014 the night \u2014 the night, When the sky is calm and clear , The night \u2014 the night \u2014 the night, When the tide and shore are Bear.\u2014 Wbo will fly the quay, And in my bark away\u2014 Who will fly the pier With the gondolier, Cheerily ! Cheerily ! The song died away in the distance; the persons congregated on the pier drinkin\" the breeze of the sea, shrugged their shoulders at the temerity of the singers \"in disturbing the silence of the night ; and recollecting their own fears through the day, muttered to each other, as they glanced at tbe gondola, fast receding from the shore, \" Bold fellows ! bold fellows!\" Many expressive \" umphs !\" and meaning glances were directed towards the boat also, as though the Gondoliers had committed high treason by indulging in mirth. But example has a powerful effect, and our worthy cynics soon had sufficient courage to speak above a whisper, though their tones were not over loud at that. Return we to the boat. Soon as the gondola was far enough from the shore, to suit the purpose of the gondolieis, the owner of the boat exclaimed, in a low tone, \u2014 \" Enough of the song ; it hath done its office, in blinding those on the pier as to our real purpose. Now to business. How speeds the cause ?\" \" Bravely,\" replied the second oarsman, \" My men are ready \u2014 their knives are sharpened, their courage strong, their spirits buoyant, as the hour approaches.\" \" And tlrine, Gennaro?\" said he ofthe stern, in a voice not to be mistaken, how much soe'er his garb might do him wrong. \" They wait the hour impatiently ; each day but makes them more impatient. The days pass slowly.\" \" I thought so, to-day,\" exclaimed he of the stern, '' as I passed from street to street, and beheld the cowardice of our inhabitants, in hiding within doors. Scarce a man to a street ! and all because Foscari had disappeared so mysteriously. Is this the courage of our Venetians ?\" \" They have been used to terror for years,\" replied Gennaro ; \" rid them of the cause of that terror, and then see if their fears are greater than those of any other nation. The ' Ten ' have held our speech and action in check so long \u2014 have robbed us of our rights and privileges for so many generations, that it is no wonder that at this their last and mest daring deed, the people shrink aghast in terror. In fact, your lordship is not altogether free from the universal dread, else why that unseemly guise in which thou now art wrapt !\" \" Not from fear have 1 donned it,\" responded the noble, \" but faom a fancy that it would save me from rude remark in my perambulations. I would see without being seen, and hold converse with the leaders of our cause without being noticed by vulgar eyes. But this aside \u2014 have ye no suspicion, after what I'vt told you of my conference with thc duke, of the accuser's name ?\" \"Hast thou?\" \" I have.\" \" Whom dost thou think ? \" Leonardo Foscari.\" \" What \u2014 his own son >\" \"The same.\" \" Heavens ! Can he be so lost to filial love and honour ? The cause V \" Nay, I suspect it only. But I opine that fear of his father's anger and re* proaclies led him to the deed. You know he is the leading spy of the \u2022 Ten ' has, from that power, free license to do what he will against the laws, for his service as a spy upon those whom meaner spies cannot reach \u2014 and that he likewise receives reward for his unprincipled labours. Ye know all this ?\""], [71, "THE ORANGE GlRL OF VENICE. 61 \" We*have so heard.\" \" My intelligence is beyond a doubt, and {subsequently confirmed by witnesses whose probity is beyond a peradventure.

But to the main matter of this conference \u2014 how didst thou find thy sister ?\" \" 111 in health \u2014 lowly in spirits,\" replied the secoDd oarsman, whom the reader has ere this recognised. \" And the lady Isabel \u2014 thou saw'st her, also?\" \" Sad in spirit ; e'en as sad as my sister.\" \" Liked they their new abode ?\" \" 'Tis safer than their last.\" \"Sent they no message?\" \" Much the Lady Isabel blushed when your name was mentioned ; and much she trembled when I spoke of the sudden and mysterious disappearance of the doge.\" \"But no message?\" \" None.\" Galliano sighed, and for a few moments, gazed in silence toward the island1 where his beloved was concealed. \" All hope is o'er for thee, Isabel,\" he murmured, \" if this our glorious cause succeed not ; thy Galliano will not outlive his struggle for his country's freedom, and then, 0 Isabel ! what, what will be thy fate. Kinless, harmless, poor and friendless, what, what will be thy fate ! But shall we fail ? \u2014 after all our secret meetings \u2014 oar midnight watchings, our expenditure of time, and wealth, and blood, \u2014 our wrongs, our sufferings, and high hopes \u2014 shall we fail ? Great God forbid it !\" In good truth, the noble was sad at heart, yea, o'ershadowed to the very soul. The circumstances attendant on his father's death \u2014 the singular discovery of his father's grave \u2014 his burial in the old family vault \u2014 the scenes witnessed in the subterraneous dungeon \u2014 the sudden death of the father of his beloved \u2014 her own dependence, weakness, danger \u2014 his combat with and triumph over tbe black \u2014 his meeting with the usurer, and the latter's death over the grave of him he mur dered \u2014 the doge's disappearance, perhaps death, and all through his means, \u2014 the gloom he witnessed o'er the city \u2014 all this floated through the chambers of his mind in images darker than the facts ; \u2014 was it then a wonder he was sad? He thought of his own cheerless home \u2014 of the dark prospect before his beloved in case all his schemes for emancipation from the Tribunal's tyranny should fail \u2014 of the woe and ruin of all engaged in that great enterprise, if fortune, time and circumstance favoured not the cause \u2014 of the revolution in men and things, if the enterprise succeeded \u2014 of the blood that must flow, whether triumph or defeat was their guerdon for the peril \u2014 he thought of this, and he was sad, \u2014 very, very sad. \u25a0' Have ye any new proselytes ?\" said the noble, in a deep voice. \u00ab' Seventy in our section, since our last meeting,\" replied Gennaro. \" And thirty-three in ours,\" added the other. , \u201e '\"\u00a3 \" Good !\" [ \" When saw you last the secretary 1\" asked Gennaro. \" An hour before dawn of to-day,\" replied the noble. \" What addition to his ledger since last report V \"\"Ninety.\" \" The work speeds on.\" \" Aye, bravely,\" said Galliano, in a more cheerful voice. \" But as for the doge, he must not die. He is a friend to the people\u2014 opposed to the Tribunal\u2014 and loves freedom equal to the best of us; \u2014 he must not die.\" \" How can we save him ?\" said the gondoliers, anxiously. \" By hurrying on the hour when we strike for liberty,\" responded the noble. '"], [72, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 62 \" He is of too high rank for the Tribunal to hurry on his death,\" said Gennaro. \" We had better look to the cause first ; \u2014 the hour rapidly approaches\u2014 to hasten it were dangerous.\" \"Thou dost not know the 'Ten' for all that thou hast suffered,\" said the noble ; \" 'tis the Tribunal's policy, once their victims are in their power, to hurry on their doom. It lacks but a week of tbe Carnival, aud, ere that time, the chances are an hundred to one that the naock trial, sentence and death of the doge will be over. . In 'which case, what new tyrant will be planted on the ducal throne ! It were best to strike at once, - anil?, savfeg ourselves, preserve the duke.\" ' \" It were dangerous,\" said Gennaro, \" for any cause soever, to change the day or hour for striking ; our preparations are made for the Carnival night \u2014 our men have been told to look forward to that night for the signal \u2014 their minds have no other thought. To change the time, or for an earlier hour or later, would change their thoughts, mar their plans, and perhaps chill their patriotism. Knowing the minds ofthe rude ones in our section, 1 think a change would be dangerous to thy cause.\" \" Well, we'll let it pass,\" said Galliano, gloomily. \" Row in ; perhaps fortune may save the old man without our aid. I shall not see ye again till the last meet ing night, when, if forlune fail me not, I shall bring ye a proselyte ye little dream of. Row in.\" The gondola was turned towards the shore ; and, as it flew over the waters, a huge crowd was seen congregating on the pier from whence our heroes started. \" Something is going on there,\" said the noble, in an excited tone. \" I know not what it is, but my heart misgives me ! On your lives, row in !\" The gondoliers needed but little bidding ; for that natural fear which creeps over men when conscious that those they love may be in jeopardy, lent fiery strength to their arms and sped their bark with the speed of lightning to the pier. The noble sprang hastily from the boat, and made his way through the crowd ; and, when his companions had neared the spot on which he stood, they beheld him standing in triumph over the prostrate figure of one well known to, and loathed by, every son of Venice \u2014 Leonardo Foscari ! \" Coward ! dastard !\" exclaimed the excited noble, waving aloft the sword be had wrenched from the prostrate roue, \" are acts like these th*? charters for thy manhood? Hast thou neither soul, nor honour, nor shame left in thy foul, filthy carcase, but thou must play the dog for ever? What! steal women from their homes by night, when their defenders are away and beyond their cries ! Take that, cowardly slave!\" and as bespoke, the foot of the excited and indignant noble was plunged into the side of the wretch : \" take that !\" he added, \" and bear it as living mark of thy unworthiness to be punished by the sword !'' The miserable wretch groaned at the pain inflicted upon his person, and gasped with a demon's passion. Starting up, he ran up the pier with wild and hurried speed, and uttering threats of vengeance. All gave way fearfully before him, and many of the crowd, fearing lest snyi n eyes should be upon them, stole from the spot noiselessly, and soon were lost \"from view. Ere those who remained had time to recover from the sudden and startling incidents, the young noble, his companions and two young female forms were seen in the gondola, and rowing fast from the shore. The forms on the pier, as if aware of the danger of being found there after such a scene, were soon scattered over other parts of the city, and the quay was deserted all vvoudering when Venice would be like the Venice\" of olden time, free from broil and tyranny and wrong."], [73, "the Orange girl of Venice. 63 CHAPTER XIV. THE EXPLANATION. The boat swept over the water like a bird fleeting from the deadly gun of the sportsman. A little island, containing about an hundred houses, was the spot \u00b0n which the boat of the gondola was directed. Having reached a broad stair flight, the rescued females were hastily landed, and escorted by the noble, borne to aA obscure looking dwelling on the eastern part of the isle. The gondoliers, imme- diately afterwards, released their bark, and, again plying their oars, pulled for an island about three hundred yards distant ; on reaching which, they pulled their boat ashore, and, covering it with a quantity of old canvass, thus giving it the ap- pearance of a boat which had lain there for some days \u2014 fled, hastily, to a low- looking shed about forty paces distant from the shore. They were met at the door by one of their own caste and costume, to whom they hurriedly related the cause of their sudden appearance, and with whom they immediately departed to another dwelling, of the same rude caste, in another part of the island. Return we now to the rescuer and the rescued. When they had reached the dwelling, the noble conducted the females into a neatly furnished apartment on the second floor, where, after pointing out to them a secret door, and discovering to them the manner of its opening, in case of a sur- prise, he left them, saying he would soon return. Descending the staircase, the noble entered the front apartment, where he was met by a middle-aged man, whose costume at once proclaimed his calling. \" Oh, good master goldsmith,\" said the noble, smiling, \" I have used the pri vilege thou gavest me \u2014 and, lo! thy chambers are in my possession. Two fair beings, whose misfortunes and persecutions are only equalled by their beauty, are now in thy charge.\" \" Aught in my humble power to serve them, shall be heartily given, my lord,\" replied the goldsmith. \" At another time, my good friend, I will tell thee of the cause of my sudden appearance here, and of the wherefore of my guardianship of the ladies who now lodge beneath thy honest roof.\" \"It matters not, my lord,\" replied the goldsmith ; \"that they are under your protection is sufficient for me that they are ladies of worth. How speeds the cause?\" '\" Bravely ! our next meeting will make the most sanguine of ns leap for rapture. Meanwhile, thy lady will do me honour and great service by keeping close the fact of her knowledge of our fair unfortunates.\" \" I pledge myself for her secrecy, my noble lord.\" Enough, my honest friend. As time is precious, and as my fair friends may need my presence for a few minutes, I'll take my leave.\" The noble hurried up stairs. Isabel and Eugenia were in tears, by the window, as he entered. *' What ! weeping, fair ones !\" he exclaimed, taking a seat near them. \" Shall the villain have it to boast that lie can make us all weep, whene'er he lists ? Nay, cease, as ye love me ! I ne'er eould bide the sight of tears \u2014 they rob me of my manhood, and turn me back, in years and feeling, to a weak and timid child.\"- \" Have we not cause for weeping ?\" said Isabel. \" Nay, I'm no woman and cannot answer thee,\" said Galliano, with a smile. \" Men think not of weeping o'er a wrong \u2014 they redress it straight, and, in the joy O'er revenge, laugh till ajl remembrance of the deed is swept away. But tell m\u00bb"], [74, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 64 lady, how it chanced I found ye so far from that asylum in which I placed you. Methought my measures for preserving you from all further persecution by Foscari were most effective.*' The orange girl blushed, and exclaimed, \u2014 \" The fault was mine, my lord, and on me let your anger fall.\" \" Nay, fair trembler, responded the noble, \" your severe sufferings swallow up all anger. Give me to know how it all has chanced, that I may take warning and prevent the further visits of the princely libertine.\" \"The night was fair,\" said Isabel, \"and, weary of our room, we sought the garden. A small arbour invited us, where, as we inhaled the evening ether, we spoke of our several destinies, ourpast, our present, and our future. While speak ing thus, a strain of music, proceeding from the garden next our own, fell upon our ears. We paused to listen ; anon, arose, and approaching the fence, drank in the sounds of the melodious instrument, till our souls forgot their woes, and were wrapt in bliss. Thus we stood, entranced, when he, Foscari, suddenly stood before us. Palsied, by fear, we scarce could speak ; and when our tongues had found free utterance, we were being dragged from our house of refuge to thc beach. We screamed and struggled, but none came to our aid, for the villain had a band of fierce and armed knaves around him, whose bright swords awed the few that we encountered on our way. Brought to the beach, we were hurried into a boat filled with stalwart and masked rowers, whose stout arms soon bore us far from shore. The wretches gagged us to silence our screams, while he, the chief villain, held our arms, and with insulting words bade us struggle not, or we should be plunged into the deep. We were silent, unresisting, till we were landed. A crowd was gathered round the pier ; and in the hope that some brave heart would attempt our rescue, we screamed and struggled as they bore us up the pier. Nor were we mistaken ; for our young friend, Calvari, was among the' crowd, who, recognising our voices, and divining|the rank and intentions of our abductors rushed boldly forward and felled the foremost wretch, who held us to the earth. The rest catching the spirit of his courage and enthusiasm, rallied to our defence. Foscari at length declared his name and rank, ard bade them stand back on peril of their lives. They all gave way but Calvari, who, fearless of everything but our danger, seized me and bade the villains do their worst. The wretches paused, fearing lest the crowd should fall on them again ; when Foscari rushing forward and dealing him a blow, commanded his myrmidons to seize and bear us to the palace. They hesitated, and he, to inspire them, seized us, and bidding the crowd give way, was dragging us onward, when your timely arrival saved us from further outrage, and punished the foul dastard.\" \"Enough! enough!\" said the noble, gaily; \"yea, more than enough,\" he muttered to himself, \" I thought him base before, but knew not till now the per fection of his villainy. But the hour is coming for him, and for all his kind. Till then, we'll let him pass.

A few days and all shall be quiet, all at rest. Our friend, the goldsmith, and his kind dame, will be your guardians in my absence. Everything necessary to your well-being will be by them provided. I need not warn you of being careful to preserve your faces from strangers, nor of listening to music in neighbouring yards,\" he added, smiling. \" There are other cavaliers as dangerous as the gay Foscari. And now,\" he took their hands, and his voice faltered as he spoke, \" farewell ! for five days you must not expect to be visited by the gloomy Gal hano. Duties weighty and imperious will detain me from paying my respects to all save a few stern friends, and they reside not in this isle. Farewell, Isabel ; farewell, Eugenia, brighter days I trust are in store for us. The clouds are not always dark, and the sun is not always hid. But when I come to ye a\u00bbain I shall look for the smiles that adorn beauty and spur men on to high and gforio'us deeds !

The Lady Isabel accompanied the noble to the door, her band still lingering in hi;. Galliano trembled, as he felt the pressure of that soft hand. It sent a chill through his stern frame that robbed him of his collectedness. At last ,unaUe longer to withstand the force of his passion, he clasped the peerless, unresisting beauty to his breast, and, in one wild, long, burning kiss, told at once hia long con cealed and ardent love.

In a vault of some two hundred and eighty feet in length and about one hundred and twenty in breadth, were assembled a host (for they were countless) of masks. Skull caps adorned their heads, hiding the dark and grey locks of every member of the assemblage. A host, we say, a host of masked heads. Their forms were dominoed, so that it was impossible to catch the slightest sight of the gear they wore. Like one massive body of human forms conjo'ned they seemed, as they stood in close pn xim'ty to each other from wall to wall of the long, broad vault. A sea of human heads, silent and breathless as that assembly of old which waited the moment of the tyrant's entrance into the imperial hall ofthe capituline city that each \u2022' might kill his share of him.\" Silent were they, as if on each one's speechlessness depended the lives of the united throng, ln one direction ihcir eyes were turned, and there, on a rough and temporary sta-je, an altar slood ; a lamp, with fivs burners, suspended from the ceiling, threw a brght glare on the open leaves of a written volume, whose chaiacters symbolic, toge her with a bare dagger, a skull on each side of the books, struck awe into every heart of that mighty throng. Grim and gaunt and teiriffic, yea, and majestic was that altar. In gfczing on't, and on its eloquent symbols, a thrill ran through the multitode, entiiusiasiic as that, ot the pious pilgrim who has spent months in weary travel to bis favourite shrine. On one side of the ahar, and in view of the whole assemblage, sat a masked figure, with a large volume before him, over whose pages he appeared to be absorbed in patriotic earnestness. Like the rest of the assembly, he wore a domino, which enveloped him from head to foot. Ihe excitement was high, as was evinced by the quick breathings which, like the first swell of ocean, ever and anon, rose up and fell back inlo the losom ot the throng. Why was that multitude so s:lent? Feared they speech would betray them, if they dared to use il? Or. tarried they a leader to open their proceedings? The hour is late, and yet, though the assembly is huge beyond conception, no word bath been spoken, no form of meeting opened. Hark! a sound as of a muffled gong! lo! the assemblage breathe freer \u2014 that sound, what doth it betoken ? Lo I the front of the altar sinks, and within two forms are seen. Their rank is noble, or else nnture hath made men wear ihe aspect of nobility, without the silken charter given by man toman to proclaim him above the common herd. Hark to ihat shout, deafening as the sudden peal which the dark and angry clouds roll forth, when the elements would fling the fear pall over the'hearts of the Triune's images. Again the peal rings forth as if to split the eaith above inio countless fragments. And now, lo ! a masked but gallant form enters from the altar's bosom leading a weak and tremulous companion inio the presence of the mighiy throng. The face of the latter is bare, and on his reverend brow and cheeks a tale of recent and tenible agony is written, as if the veil which hides the caves of ihe Infernal King from human vision had been opened to him alone of all the breathers this side the abyss of eternities. The shout of the multitude ceases on his appearance, a: d mouihs are agape with wonder. Murmurs run through the vault, and whis pers of Lalf-believi-d treachery are audible. Concealed knives are half-drawn from their sheaths, and half-suppressed mutterings tell the dar gd* of the new coiner. The younger raises his haudalolt \u2014 and now the murmurs cease, the daggers are ieiurnei to their sheaths, and marvel takes the place of audible suspicion. The old man casts his eyes around ihe mighty throng, but masks masks-\u2014"], [77, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 67 masks greet his vision on every hand. .His cheek is pale with suffering, not fear. His limbs are tremulous, and his lips in vain essay to speak. His younger and more hardy companion leads him to a seat on the right of the altar, and, like a son humouring the whims of a feeble-minded parent, fears not, in sight of a thousand eyes, to do each little act which gives relief or feeds the humour of his sire. And now that kindness is acknowledged by the throng, for lo ! how lustily they shout. The hand of '.he mask is raised again \u2014 the assemblage is damb. Hark ! to the voice ofthe swayer ofthe multitude. \" Venetians, ye must not deem me faithle-s to the post which ye have honoured me with, because of the lateness of my arrival at this our last, most solemn r..eeting. But when ye have heard the cause of my detention, ye will pardon my lateness. Ye know well the features of yon old man \u2014 ye have known, ye have felt his kindness, justice, and humanity for years, when the dark power, for whose destruc- tion we are now assembled, held over us the hidden steel and midnight summons. Look on him, pity him, for he hath suffered, \u2014 welcome him, for I bring him to ye as a candidate for your voices. \" For the last five days, he hath suffered the infernal torments which onlv the fiends of Venice are capable of inflicting upon man. On a base, false, and cowardly charge he was summoned at midnight, by the dark messenger of th e tribunal to appear before the ' Ten' and answer to charges which none but a devil could invent. He was tried, condemned, and sentenced fo the 'sulphur death.' Venetians, he is your doge \u2014 ye are his loyal subjects, and now, fresh from the dungeon's torture, he comes to join us in our battle with the foes ofliberty an.l conscience. Shall he be one of us I it is for your voices to decide whether our cause shall be aided by the influence and worth of one so potent as our doge.' \" Who will vouch for his honesiy?\" demanded a voice in the throng. \"Galliano,\" responded the noble, boldly. A look of gratitude from the aged victim rewarded the young noble's generosity. \u2022' Shall he be one of us?\" demanded G.illiano energetically ; \" shall we proceed in the coming struggle with a star at our side, whose fame as a warrior, a states- man, and a man hath never been excelled by the brightest of our country's sons? Shall we go forth, with this brave man and true, this great man aid good, this sage and warrior, at our head, or shall we, trusting to his honour and fidelity, lit him depart, to be again seized by the dark tribunal, a victim to its rapacity. It is for you to say whether he shall become one of us, and live; or, return to the Ven- geance ofthe ' Ten,' and die !\" The assembly was silent. \" Your signal, friends, your signal,\" cried the noble. Every right hand ofthe throng was raised aloft, \" Enough, friends \u2014 I thank ye.\" Then turning to the pale doge, the noble added \u2014 \u2022' Father of Venice, Jacopo the Just, it is thp pleasure of these worthy citizens that you be admitted into our holy cause. Thou wilt now prepare to take the initiatory oath; it is a solemn and a huly one, and he who breaks it, forfeits all right to honour, manhood, yea, and life. Art thou willing to run such hazard ?\" \" I am,\" replied the old man, firmly. '' Then arise, and take thy siand with me beside this altar. ' The doge obeyed. \" Lay thy hand upon this holy volume,\" added the noble, \" aud follow me in the oath.\" '\u2022 By all my hopes of life on earth \u2014 by all the ties that bind me to kindred, friends and country \u2014 by all my hopes of heaven and fears of hell \u2014 I swear to be faithful and true to the cause of which 1 am a brother ; to hold myself in readiness to follow the orders of my officers ; to aid my brother members when in suffering or in danger ; to be ready at all hours, whenever snmn.oned, lo carry out the object of our institution \u2014 to keep secret ite secrets, to keep seciet its proceedings, to keep secret the names of its members, lo keep secret its place of meeting \u2014 10 advance its power, influence, and number by every means in the power of my hands, mind,"], [78, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 68 and tongue ; to give of my means and abundance all that can be given, to sustain and stfengthen our institution j to obey when ordered, though it were to sacrifice my dearest friends, my kindred in blood, or though it were to jeopardise mraeown life ; to obey its officers, though to obey were peril beyond conception : 1 his -ao I swear, in sight of heaven and earth, and will maintain my oaih before the courts of Life, Death, or Darkness !\u00bb , - Word for word, with trembling lips, he followed the speaker, till the last word ot the fearful and responsible oath was uttered. Then advanced the secretary with his ledger. Laying it on the altar.he opened its pages, saying, \u2014 \"Thy name?\" \"For what?\" demanded the doge. \" This book doth bear the name of every member of our order, signed, or marked, by his own hand,\" responded the secretary. \" Give me the pen,\" said the duke, huskily. It was put into his hand. _ , f Why paused he ? His son was one of the creatures of the \u00ab|Ten \u2014 the len , were terrible in their decrees, terrible in their tortures \u2014 but his son was allied to them\u2014 if the \"tTen\" were destroyed, his son, his darling, spoiled, but yet his son, would be swept away with them. He had suffered by both, terribly suffered\u2014 but he was a father, and had a father's feelings. E'en now, if his Leonardo stood before him, for all his wickedness of heart, he felt he could forgive him wholly, yea, heartily forgive him. Though his son bad forgot his duties, his loyalty, his manliness, his affection, still there was yet a pleader for him in his father s heart. He knew his boy to be marked\u2014 that many a heart in tbat throng thirsted for his blood, and would have it\u2014 and yet he, a father, was about to join a band of men whose solemn purpose was to slay, in cold blood, suddenly, and at midnight, the protectors of his son. He felt his eyes grow dim\u2014 he could not see the book Before him, his hand trembled. \"Why dost thou pause?\" said the noble. The lips ofthe doge moved, but no sound issued forth. \" The torture hath done its work upon him,'' thought the noble. \" He fears to sign, hut he has taken the oath,\" shouted a voice. \u2022 He must sign, or die, doge or no doge,\" shouted another. \u00b0 Aye, he must,\" echoed an hundred voices, at once. \"Silence!\" thundered Galliano, indignantly ; \" think ye the old man means us treachery ? For shame ! Scarce two hours have flown, since I with the conni- vance of one of the tribunal's instruments, rescued him, stealthily, from the dungeon where he was to linger till murdered by the torture ! Last night the tribunal stretched him on the rack to extort confession. 'Tis the agony of his tortured limbs that now makes him pause. His strength is gone. Would you add to his sufferings by harsh, unkind reproaches ?\" The throng was silent. The old man leaned against the altar, and, casting a look of gratitude upon his defender, said, feebly \u2014 \" Cease thy pleading, noble youth ; I am not popular with these stern men, and thy efforts will be of little or no avail . My hours are well nigh numbered,\u2014 my aidin your cause feeble, no matter bow heartily given. Still, go on ; go on, with an old man's dying blessing. Rid Venice of its plague \u2014 sweep them off, and be freemen once more. Posterity will do your efforts justice, whether fruitless or successful. If you succeed, go at once to an election and create your doge. Let the people's choice live and reign for the people ; not for himself, but for the great body of Venice, I\u2014 I \u2014 .\" His voice had now sunk to a whisper. Galliano rushed toward and supported him from falling. The secretary ran, and throwing the old man's right shoulder over his neck, sustained him on one side, as the young noble did the same on the other. The doge then turning his face toward the throng, and, running his eyes over th* multitude, as if to command their attention, said, in a tone feeble, but whisperingly"], [79, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF 69 udible, * Venetians, I have not enough of life in me to aid your cause physically; fresh from tbe torture bouse of the tribunal, with the effects of the rack now hastening me into the dark house of the lifeless, I can attest how high and how holy is the cause which has for its object the entire desWiction of so dark and terrible a power. I implore you to put a period to this fiendish tribunal. Its acts for an hundred years, as the archives of our royal library all attest, have been ofthe most remorse less and fiendish character \u2014 its dark pall falling alike on the tender maid, as on the time-hued matron : sparing none, but with mocking trials, and relentless tortures, hurrying all into the dark shades of the eternities. Shall this be longer borne, and we be called Venetians ? No; let us arise in our might, and, with one purpose, one thought, free ourselves from such cowardly dastards, such blood thirsty fiends. Their houses of torture are well known to this gallant gentleman beside me, whose strong heart and fearless arm rescued me from the death-cell. He knows their dark avenues and mazes, their mysterious doois and hidden traps, and can lead you through all their labyrinths as unerringly s*. s if he had traversed them since childhood. Let him be your guide. And, if an old man's prayer can aught avail, let him be your leader, too ; a more faithful, a keener, a bolder cannot be foand on earth.\" A burst of applause here informed the venerable speaker that the sentiments of the throng were in unison with his own. The duke proceeded, in a tone firmer than before : \" The counsels of your leader must be obeyed ; no murmurs must ascend to dis courage, no deeds performed other than be bas ordered, to baulk bis purposes. Be firm, courageous, and fear not ; in the hour ye choose for the attempt, let no thought of fear enter your breast ; but let each man strike as if a world's existence depended on bis bravery.\" Ask Heaven's slid on your enterprise, and fear not but the succeeding dawn will break on tbe overthrow of the tribunal, and be the birth hour of our freedom !\" Scarce had he finished, when a spontaneous shot from the huge throng, rang through the vault, and voices shouted, \" Foscari ! Foscari! be one of us ! be one ofus!\"' Over exertion, in his address, had weakened the doge, and he could scarcely master himself sufficiently to bow his thanks. He seized the pen, and, with a trembling band, added his name, to the long list : at sight of which, loud bursts of cheers again rang through the vault, and voices shouted \u2014 \" Foscari I Foscari ! Fascari tbe Just ! he is one of us \u2014 be is one of us !\" When the enthusiasm ofthe throng had somewhat abated, the President of the Patriots took his seat, andi with a little hammer, called all to silence ; and then called on the secretary for the list of new members. This being done, the latter were summoned to the altar, and there, hand in hand, the foremost having his hand upon the book, the formalities of initiation were gone through, and the rostrum was again cleared. The general histor yof the institution was then read by the secretary; all its transactions, the amount of funds loaned to arm and support its members in the coming struggle; the number of its members, and all and everything pertaining to its transactions. Speeches were made to strengthen and encourage tbe timid ; warnings were given to intimidate the doubtful, if any such were there. The place of gathering on the following night appointed ; a benediciction, by the doge, was pronounced ; and ten minutes afterwards, thevault was all dark, all silent."], [80, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 70 CHAPTER XVI. THE NIGHT OF THE CARNIVAL. The skies were dark and starless : the night queen, as if in anger, shed neither ray nor light upon the earth ; agloomy, solemn darkness pervaded the isles scattered over the broad Adriatic ! the Waters were still as if the Eternal's voice bad turnedlt into dark and solid glass ; the atmosphere was deadly calm and hot. The piers of Venice were crowded with continually arriving boats from the nume rous isles around ; the streets were thronged with citizens and strangers, all at tended by servants bearing flambeaux, and all hurrying towaHs St. Mark's Square. Torches and lamps festooned, hung beneath the windows of every house; music, from a thousand instruments, greeted the comers, now issuing from every corner in the square. The street, from side to side, was floored with close-grooved planks, and ren dered as slipperv as gla-_s by holistone ; and cautious was the foot lhat did not fall. Shoes, sandals, 'boots, slippers, and chopines, were chalked by the knowing ones ; whiile those who visited the scene fur the first time, afforded greaf diversion by their numerous falls, and awkward attempts to preserve their equilibrium. The sports commenced by the entrance of a hundred morris dancers, all dressed in tight-fitting pantaloons and jackets, with numerous small bells attached to their steeple caps and belted waists. Their grotesque dance biing finished, and confidence implanted in the breasts of the over- modest, the hilarity of the carnival began. Clowns, sober citizens, monkeys, villagers, tigers, usurers, and monks, all joined in one mirthful set, each figure dancing, as closely as possible, in imitation of the thing whose character he represented. The heat was oppressive, and cunning Wights, taking advantage of the holitime, carried about water, and choice wines, for which receiving whatever they de manded, they made enough to pay for tbe time lost in ptepariftg, and the expense incurred in costuming for the gay holitime. Nuns with everything but nun- like steps, might be seen, arm-in-arm, with a soldier ; a tiger with a monkey on his back, the monkey doing the roaring part, and the tiger, both through mistake, performing the monkey's squeak; a burly monk with huge chops, and laughter-loving eyes, dancing a comic couplet with a gay shepherdess; a king footing it wiih a huge, greasy looking Cook; and ten thousand other fantastic and laughable vagaries might be witnessed, as the sports and crowd increased. The b.ll of St. Mark's temple struck the midnight signal ; and, ere its sound had died away, the darkness was changed to the light of day, by the sudden dis charge of a thousand rockets, from all parts of the torch- lit square. This lasted for about five minutes, in which time a countless host of caps were raised aloft on poles, and swung round in the air, amidst deafening shouts. Pedlers of food, and wine, and water were now seen busily disposing of their articles to the hungry and thirsty, while the thousand antics of the merry throng kept the pave alive with boisterous delight. A tall form stood at the door ofa two- story house, opposite the temple of St. Mark, scanning, with scowling brows, the figures of the merry multitude. The bouse before which he stood had nothing in it to distinguish it from the buildings on either siUe of it, exetpt, indeed, that its facade was humbler in its pretensions. It was an ordinary building, and free from all the fancy of stucco and carved work which distinguished the majority of the buildings in St. Mark's Square. It ap peared to be the residence of some wealthy, but unpretending citizen, and had"], [81, "I THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 71 nothing to recommend it to the passing eye, but its simplicity. The individua' aUuded to was young in years, gay in his habiliments, handsome in figure and fea tures, and evidently one who had no small opinion of his own importance. His eyes were everywhere ; but an eye was on him, that he little dreamt of ; an eye, dark, large, sharp, and piercing as his own. Having satisfied his curiosity, and growing tired of gazing on sports in wbich neither his humour nor pride would permit him to mingle, he opened the door cautiously, though in an apparently care less manner, and disappeared. Whether h? had received a signal, invisible to all bu' himself, to hurry him from the scene where he was only a spectator, or whe ther he retired to avoid the eye or presence of some approaching foe, it matters not \u2014 he retired, and, a few moments afterward, a fancy masque was being played almost in front of the house, which was so attractive, that hundreds, aye hundreds on hundreds, gathered around to witness it. They gathered around to witness the mask, we say ; but many, instead of re maining to feast their eyes upon the farce, gradually drew back, and one by one, disappeared through the very door which the personage before mentioned had en tered. The mirth of the masque was at its height \u2014 the spectators were splitting their sides with laughter \u2014 their eyes were bent upon each feature of the gay per formance, when, Io ! hundreds Fell back, just as unpropped earth gives way before the press of dampness, and approached the open door. They disappeared rapidly, and when the masque was over, the remaining auditors were astonished at the thin ness of their number. They imagined that the play they had been looking on was poor, and that the greater part of its auditors had retired in disgust ; and so, like wise people, they left the spot too, in order that they might not be reproached with gazing delightedly upon a play oi parvenu ca3te ! CHAPTER XVII. THE DUNGEONS OF THE TRIBUNAL. The trial chamber of the tribunal was about sixty feet in length, thirty in width, and about sixteen feet high. The walls and ceiling were lined with black silk velvet, ornamented (or disfigured, if you will), with silver emblems of the dif ferent modes of torture used by the council to extort coniession, or silence the breathings of its victims. Near the head ofthe apartment stood an altar, covered with the same dark material, the front of which was garnished with a silvery cross, woven into the cloth. A semi-circular seat ran round the altar, on which the members of the tribunul sat when deliberating, or holding council on their victims. In its centre was up, upraised chair, for the president, and before it, lying on the altar, an open book, a uaked dagger, and materials for writing. At either end of the altar stood a table, covered with parchments and writing materials ; while directly before it stood a circular paling of iron, for prisoners when on trial. A huo-e lamp, hung from the ceiling, over the palling, whose bright light was calcu lated to fall directly upon the person of the prisoner. A rack, with all its infernal apparatus, was visible, a few paces from the altar. Such was the trial chamber, when its members were absent. But on the night of the carnival, it was tenanted, and hideous was the sight it presented. A white haired man, haggard and pale, stood in the prisoner's dock! \u2014 chains on his hands, and chains on his feet ; a pulley hung from the ceiling, the hook of whieh ran"], [82, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 72 through an iron circle attached to the back ofa broad, thick, leathern belt, which girded tbe waist of the prisoner; the end of this pulley was in the hands of a couple of fierce looking wretches, garbed in coarse dark frocks, reaching to their knees. The tribunal was sitting, each member bare headed, masked, and domi noed. The lamp before mentioned, threw a broad, bright light over the features of the half naked prisoner, over the bright trappings of the velveted walls andcell ing, over the parchments and altar and rack, and over the glossy masks and domi noes of the judges, . ,, , . .1 \" Jacopo Foscari,\" said be, who sat in the president's chair, what hast thou to say to the charge urged against thee?\" \" Not guilty,\" responded the prisoner. \" Not guilty ?\" repeated the judge, in apparent amazement. \" We have a wit ness against you.\" \" Produce him,\" said the prisoner. \" Behold him,'' said the president, pointing to one of the council, wbo had just rise n from his seat. \"Doth he accuse me?\" demanded the prisoner, faintly. \" He doth,\" responded the president. \" Of murder ?\" \" Of murder.\" \" Hath he sworn it?\" \" He hath.\" \" He hath spoken falsely, sirs. Jacopo Foscari arraigns him foi falsehood and perjury.\" '\u25a0 Thou are thyself arraigned, doge, and it behoves thee to rid thyself of the charges against thee, ere thou attemptest to bear witness against another. Thou art accused of the foul murder of Uberoni, the rich usurer, for the sake of his sup posed wealth. Sentence hath been passed upon thee. Why should it not be per formed !\" \" Ye have the power, dark men, as ye are,\" said the prisoner, boldly, \" ye have the power of murder in your hand, and ye may use it on me, soon as it consorts with your will ; but I am innocent, and sith there is no means of baffling ye in your humour for my blood, e'en take my life : 'twill be but another to the already long list of your crimes.\" ,<i\" Beware, rash man,\" exclaimed the president, \" less impertinence in thy speech would perhaps incline us to mercy.\" \" Mercy ! your mercy f\" cried the prisoner, in tones ofthe most withering scorn ; \" ye showed it me two nights agone, when, upon this same false charge, ye stretched me on yon rack, and, after glutting your sanguinary eyes upon my tor tures, ye bade your slaves release and plunge me back into the dungeon from whence ye took me. Your mercy ! the mercy of the ' Ten !' Ha ! ha I ha! \" \"Madman!\" exclaimed the president, \"dost beard us to our very throats ! Ho ! there, ye knaves ! lay him on the rack ! Wrench him limb from limb ? We'll see if his proud heart cannot be broken, or his unbridled tongue taught reverence and decency in its speech !\" Ab the minions of the tribunal obeyed the order of thc president, he who had s\u00abod up as witness against the doge, was seen to start and heard to groan as if an earthquake had suddenly opened before him. A hand of one beside him wa\u00bb laid gently upon his shoulder, and his presence of mind returning, he resumed his former seeming stolidity. \" Now,\" continued the president, rising, and gazing upon his victim, as he lay tretched upon the iron bed, \u2022' confess the means by which thou didst escape thy dungeon yesternight, and thou shalt escape the torture.\"' The prisoner was silent. \" Confess the name of thy accomplice, and thou shalt be pardoned the murder of the usurer,\" continued the president. Still the prisoner uttered not a word. *' Confess, ere I give the sign,\" thundered the president."], [83, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 73 \"I laugh at thee and thy threats, villain,\" responded tbe prisoner. The council rose in agitation, and hastily collected round the prostrate man. In faitb, they had good cause for trembling ; a traitor was within their gates, or else the secret of the entrance to their dungeons was known to some daring one unknown to the tribunal. He, the doge, their last and highest victim, had found some secret means of escaping his dungeon ; true, they had re-captured him, at dawn, as he was stealing, with a companion, through a bye-path, near St. Mark's cathedral, into the rear of the gardens of the ducal palace ; still, the secret of the entrance was known to another than themselves. The fact troubled them, and to find out the name of the being possessing this mighty and dangerous secret, caused the tribunal to dally with their victim ere they resorted to the last |deadly measure. \"Confess, and save thy life,\" said tbe president; \"give us but the name of No. 10."], [84, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 74 him our spies found thee with this morn, aud thou shalt live. Refuse, and thou shalt die.\" \" Do your worst \u2014 I'll betray no man,\" replied the prisoner firmly. \" Beware ! our vengeance is \" \"Laughed at, and at end,\" thundered a voice, without. A moment more, and a knight, in black armour, his vizor down, his sword drawn, and accompanied hy a hundred warriors, iu mail, each bearing a broad, bright blade in his right hand, entered the chamber, and confronted the astonished tribunal. '' Ho, there ! what treachery is this 1\" cried the president, starting back. \" No treachery, villains !\" replied the black knight ; \"we are Venetians, and your doomsmen ! Seize them !\" he added, pointing to his companions. \" Stand back, knaves !\" cried one of the judges, rushing forward, his sword drawn, and throwing off his domino, \" stand back, as ye do value life ! Give we but the signal, ye are on all sides hemmed in, and death, death in its most startling and terrible shape, is your portion. Think ye to come and beard us thus in our very den ? Fly, fools, fly, and save your wretched lives!\" \"Cease, thou foul-mouthed braggart! cease thine empty vauntings, for every passage, or entrance to this bloody chamber is filled with men thirsting for your blood ! Think'st thou, by this shallow trick, to intimidate hearts a thousand times more brave and cunning than thine own ? Fool ! thou, art too well begirt, though armies could now spring up on all sides of this chamber to aid thee \u2014 death, death, in its moat uppalling forms, have been marked out for thee and all thy fellow assassins! Seize them!\" The knights obeyed ; and, in five minutes, every member of tbe tribunal, together with the wretches who were about to strangle the aged man on the rack, were seized, bound and tied to the altar around which they had so often sat in sanguinary council. \" Behold, my friends,\" cried the black knight, pointing to the rack, \" behold the weapons of these midnight murderers. Behold the fearful engines we are called upon by reason, manhood, justice, aye, and fate, to destroy. Release yon noble victim, and bear him to the palace. We'll hear his thanks another time,\" he continued with averted face, as the doge, freed from his iron manacles, was about to throw himself on bis knees and thank his deliverers, for their timely arrival j \" we'll hear his thanks another time. Bear him hence, and see him well attended, ere ye quit your burden. Away !\" \" And now,\" continued the knight, \" pass the word for the oil, we'll teach these idle hounds tbe mercy they have taught to others.\" The oil was brought. \"Now, 6irs,\" said the black knight, turning to the judges, ffit is but the empty ing of these jars upon this pave, and the touching of this torch to the oil, and ye are in a human hell, built by your own death-dealing hands. What if we so act ?\" The judges were silent. \" What if, like yourselves, we, to satisfy our thirst for blood, fire these dungeons, leaving you, partners in blood and iniquity, to list to each other's cries and shriek s and groans, as the flames of vengeance hurry ye from this chamber of fire into that burning lake the other side the eternities which ye so long have laughed at ?\" \"Do it,\" said one of the judges, sullenly ; \"we fear not.\" \"Liar that thou art,\" replied the knight, \" 'tis thy fear that gives thee this sad show of courage in the dark hour pf death. Are ye then so brave, that ye will not ask for mercy ? Ho, there!\" he added, turning to his men, \" swathe these walls with oil. We'll e'en burn the villains into a crisp.\" A cry of terror, rose from the midst of the captive judges, as thev beheld the threat of their unknown captor being carried into effect. \" What ! ye come to your senses at last, eh V exclaimed the knight with a derisive laugh ; \"ye begin at last to have a foretaste of the dark doom which ye"], [85, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 75 have so oft inflicted upon your wretched victims ? Ho, there ! my brave hear s> seize these dastards, and convey them to the outer vault.\" His command was obeyed. ''Now then, friends,\" continued the knight, \"pass the word, to set all the captives free, swathe all the dungeons with oil and pitch, and when we reach the outer vault, let tbe torch fire the dungeons \u2014 if possible, we'll end our glorious work without shedding a drop of human blood.\" The dungeons were opened, and captive after captive released, till not a cell was left unexplored. The walls, floors, and ceilings were then bedaubed with oil and pitch, and all moved, hastily, to the outward vault. There the judges stood, chained, and, devoid of iheir cloaks, gazing sullenly on their captors, \u2014 their faces were well known, and the huge throng recognised many a favourite citizen among the now powerless judges The black knight advanced towards one who bore a torch, and seizing it, cried out \u2014 \" Seize these villains, and bear them to the ducal hall. Away, on your lives \u2014 for the brand must now end these scenes of blood!\" None needed a second bidding ; and making a rush for the stair flight, were, with their captives, soon beyond the reach of danger. The knight finding himself alone, flung the burning torch into the narrow passage; and for a moment paused to witness the result. The passage, swathed wiih oil and pitch, was instantaneously in a flame, and spreading like a sea of fire, till all before him was of one lurid glow. The heat drove' him to the stair flight, where stood a large jar of pitch and oil. A slight push sent it into the vault, where it was soon caught by the ap proaching fire. The danger was now evident, and, closing the door, the black knight ran, with his few remainii g companions, up stairs. A crowd was congre gated without the door ; which, on ihe approach of our hero, soon gave way, and all bent their steps towards the palace. In a square phalanx they moved, the black knights in the centre, till they reached the ducal mansion. CHAPTER XVIII. THE TRIAL. The reception hall of the ducal palace was filled (o overflowing. An oaken desk, carved in the fashion of the furniture of the middle ages, sloud in the upper end of the hall. Behind it, his vizor off, and his manly face exposed to the full view of the multitude, sat Galliano, the hero of the night Ranged on either side, were twenty knights in black armour, each nolding his helmet on his arm before his breast. On either end of the desk stood a large waxen taper, flinsring a broad light around. 'Ihe captive judges were in a line before the iesk, their faces towards the desk, and separated from the specators by an iron railin*?, whieh ran fiom side to side of the apartment. Silence reigned throughout the hall. \"Venetians,\" said Galliano, in a stern voice, \"the late foes of our beloved country, are now before you for judgment. The witnesses against them are your own eyes, and the sufferings .which we all have endured since nature gave us breath. Are ye prepared for judgment?\" \"We are,\" was the reply, as with one voice. \"Their crimes are known to ye \u2014 their villany as plainly graven on your hearts, as the memory of yesterday. Speak, what is the doom of the prisoners ?\" \"Death!\" was the solemn response. \" Without shriving \u2014 without preparation ?\""], [86, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE J 76 \" Without shriving \u2014 without preparation !\" \"Their mode of death?\" \" The block\u2014 the block I\" \" When, and where?\" \" This hour, and in front of the church of St. Mark !\" \" Who shall be their executioner?\" \" Their chief,\" was the reply again, as with one voice. ' Ho, there ! \" exclaimed the black knight, rising from his seat, \" let the hall be cleared ; and let the state block and axe, which have lain so long unused, be brought and placed on the portico of St. Mark's. It is decreed !\" The hall was cleared of all save the knights and their prisoners. Galliano whispered to his companions ; on which two of them hastily left the apartment by a side door. Silence reigned there some half hour ; at the expiration of which time, the knights returned, accompanied by a grey haired priest and a mantled female. Galliano led the latter behind an oaken desk. She trembled, and would have sunk, had not the arm of the noble sustained her. \" Courage, fair lady,\" he whispered ; \" courage, or else our pains will all be turned to naught. Command thy nerves with all thy might ; harm cannot come to thee, surrounded as thou art by those wbo know thy melancholy history well, and who would die for thee. Courage !\" She answered not, but bent her head upon his arm, and wept. The noble made a sign to those who had brought the lady, and they advanced; resigning the female to their charge, Galliano fixed his eye upon one'of the captives, and said, in a deep and solemn tone. '' Leonardo Foscari \u2014 on the verge of eter nity, as thou art, I summon thee in Heaven's name, to do one act of justice, which will, in part, redeem the infamy thou hast brought upon thy father's name.\" 'What is it?\" demanded Foscari, sullenly. \" Behold this tender form,\" said the noble, turning and pointing as be spoke \" and let thy once noble heart answer thee.\" \" I am no reader of riddles,\" replied the roue, sneeringly. \" Nor need'st thou be, to draw the meaning I would have thee,\" said the noble, stifling his anger at the insolent reply. \" Lead him hither ?\" he added, addressing the knights near the prisoners. The roue made no resistance. \" What think'st thou now ?\" said the noble, lifting aside the veil which had hidden the features of the female. \" Eugenia!\" exclaimed the roue, starting back at the pale coutenance of his weeping victim. \" The same,\" said the noble, indignantly ; \" Eugenia, the orange girl of Venice ! She, whom thy false tongue did first betray and afterwards malign. Behold her now, pale with misery and woe \u2014 behold her now, heart-broken, as thou hast made her ! \" \"Well, sir, the object of bringing us again together ?\" said the roue, with a sneer, and recovering his self-possession. \" To urge thee to do her justice, \" replied the noble, indignantly. \" As how, my gallant lord?'\" \" By wedding her, ere thou diest,\" responded Galliano. The roue laughed. \" Hast thou no heart ?\" said a feeble voice near him. Foscari turned pale and started \u2014 his sire was before him \u2014 his sire, pale with suffering in limb and brain. \" Hast thou no heart ?\" repeated the doge, in a low, feeble, sad, reproachful voice ; \" hast thou no heart, Leonardo?\" The roue heard the tones of that voice, and siw the mighty change in that face whose features almost till now were ever turned on him with parental love and pride. He shrank as he gazed, he trembled at the changed tones of that voice, as they fell upon his ear \u2014 changed, too, by his own ingrate heart."], [87, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 77 \" On the verge of that dread eternity, where we soon shall meet together,\" con untied the doge, \" I implore thee to do what thou canst, whilst yet the breath is in thee, by righting this poor girl. Lo ! death is near at hand, boy, and if thou'lt but do this one little act of justice, thy father's lips will pronounce his pardon for thy guilt towards him, and his last prayer shall ascend to Heaven for mercy on thy soul! Wit thou doit?\" Leonardo replied not. \" Hast thou no spark of manliness nor honour left in thee, boy?\" said the doge, in a choked voice. \" Shall thy poor father go down into his grave with the con viction that bis only begotten shamed the mother's breast that bore him ? Speak, Leonardo, \u2014 my boy \u2014 oDe word ! See, thy poor sire is on his knees before thee I\" The eyes of the roue were moistened \u2014 his lips trembled \u2014 his frame shook \u2014 he spoke no word, but his sire had conquered. The roue raised his father kindly up \u2014 then sank at his father's feet \u2014 then seized his father's hands in his, and implored his forgiveness. \" When thou hast righted her thou hast wronged !\" said th? old man, solemnly . At this moment, the solemn tongue of St. Mirk's steeple tolled a solitary chime. The doge staggeredagainst the desk \u2014 his face ashy, his eyes turned upward, and his lips murmuring \u2014 \" O God !\" \" The block is prepared \u2014 the axe whetted,\" said a solemn voics, at the door. What is that glossy stream now coursing down the old man's cheeks \u2014 tears, silent ones ? The roue advanced to the orange girl, and taking her hand, said, in a low, deep voice \u2014 \" Eugenia, thy hand is cold and icy ; unlike the hand which, in days long gone, I used to hold in mine without a sigh or murmur from thy lips : it is cold now, as thy betrayer's soon will be. I did thee foul and heartless wrong, for which, on the threshold of eternity, I implore thy pardon and the forgiveness of thy kindred. The priest is at hand to seal my repentance \u2014 let him approach, that my last act on earth may not add to the remorse which burns within this heart.\" The ceremony commenced, went on, was finished. Again, St. Mark's bell rang a warning note. \" The prisoners are summoned to the block,\" said tbe voice at the door. \" Let this my first, my last honest kiss, Eugenia,\" said tbe roue in a brusque tone, \" be the pledge of my repentance.\" Then rushing to his father, he knelt, and, seizing the old man's listless hand, exclaimed \u2014 \" Father ! father ! now forgive and bless me!\" The lips of the doge moved, but nought save a whispering sound was heard. \" Father ! father ! for God's sake ! speak to me !\" repeated the roue in agony. His father's eyes were raised heavenward \u2014 his lips were moving, as if in prayer The bell pealed again. \" Thc hour lor death is struck,\" said the voice. The roue started up \u2014 embraced his unconsious sire \u2014 then waving a farewell to hisnew made bride, sprang into the procession of judges, as guarded on either side, by the black knights, they slowly left the hall. The doge, the priest, the orange girl and one in the garb of a gondolier alone remained. The lips and eyes ofthe doge still heavenward turned ; the priest and gondolier supporting the statue-like form of the veiled bride. The bell struck again ; a sound as of an axe falling on a block, grated on their ears. A long loud shriek rang through the hall \u2014 the orange girl fell back. Shouts swelled in the square, as the last stroke of the executioner's axe fell ou the block, and cries, wild and solemn \u2014 and shrill and enthusiastic, split the air \u2014 \" The tyrants are slain \u2014 Venice is free !\" With that loud shout, the lips of the doge (eased to move \u2014 his eyes grew glassy \u2014 bis limbs tottered, and bis spirit was travelling with that of his son to the Soul's High Court."], [88, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 78 CHAPTER XIX. THE DAWN OF FREEDOM. The news of the execution flew from mouth to mouth, like wildfire ; tbe people looked in each others' eyes half paralysed j even those who had been in tbe con spiracy could scarce believe their glorious work was fully accomplished, till they beheld' the decapitated trunks of those who had composed the tribunal. The car nival ceased, only to break forth anew with wilder mirth. People laughed, danced, shouted, yea, and wept for gladness' sake. Groups met, chatted a moment over the affair, then separated, in wild joy, and, collecting again together, rehearsed their former converse. So wild the enthusiasm, that old men, forgetting their age, frolicked, danced, gambolled, shouted, and made merry, like youths ; misers forgot their avarice, and joining in the general gladsomeness, squandered the savings of years; processions foimed in every part of the city, and preceded by music, strode through Venice in triumph. The sick and the feeble, tbe halt and the blind, were helped to the windows that they might either see the cavalcade, or hear the enthusiastic strains \"Much announced their country's freedom from the thrall of the long-dreaded. The timid forgot their timidity, and, as 'they strode in the processions, felt brave as the bravest ; the niggard forgot his narrow-heart edness, and when the upraised hand of the b ggar met his regenerated eye, gave of his means freely ; men who had long been foes, met, arid in the patriotism of iheir hearts, looked kindly on each other, and embraced ; j 'a'ousies were forgotten by rival tradesmen, and free and generous hands and sympathies exchanged, and last- ing friendships formed where all before was hatred. It was a time of universal joy, and brought back to the mental eye of the moialist, those happy days and scene when men's faces were the outward pictures of their hearts. Still there was a sadness, too, in Venice \u2014 the corse of the just doge, \u2014 Foscari, \u2014 lay in state in the ducal pa'ace. Waxen tapers gleamed around the bier, and monks, and priests, and the dignitaries of the state sat in little groups thinking of the dead. Alone in his palace with no son nor wife nor daughter to weep o'er his pale and deathly brow, lay Jacopo the Just. None wept for bim \u2014 none told his virtues, his secret deeds of charity, or his worth. Men of place and mammon were around him, gazing on his shroud, and thinking of their future in regard to place and mammon. They knew their country was freed from a yoke which had, in its time, boned all their necks to its will ; but they participated not in the general joy, because the doge's eath and the tribunal's overthrow might be the harbingers only of their loss of office. And in this train of thought around the bier of death, they pondered o'er the means of coining gold and a place. \" Who shall be the next doge? Who be the electors? Shall my office and its emoluments be wrested from me? Or shall 1 btcmne a favourite wiih the elected one? Such were a few of the thousand interrogatories each of the sitters put to himself, while paying one of the last duties of man to his fellow man in that hall where death rejoiced o'er one victim. But there were many on that day whose minds were sorely rent reflecting on the state of things which had been brought about by the conspirators. The doge was dead \u2014 this was pot expected, ami no provision had been made for such emergency. A pany of twenty \"men were assembled in St. Mary's vault. Their ages varied from thiny to titty years. They were of differeut castes in rank, and each was guarded as befitted his rank and calling. They were sitting in solemn conclave, upon the rostrum and around the altar on which they had before sworn to immo late the tyrannical rulers of their country. They were the officers of the sworn biotherhood. They had been in council since daybreak, and bad not broken"], [89, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE. 79 bread nor tasted drink, nor closed their eyes in slumber since the hour of their entrance into the dungeons of the late tribunal. It was now verging on lo noon, and they had not ye* decided on the obj *ct of their meeting. When the council had broken up, a glow of earnest satisfaction was visible in every eye and on every cheek ; and on the day succeeding the burial of the late doge, the anxieties and care** of those who had held office under him were set at rest for ever : and \u2014 they murmured ! CHAPTER XX. THE BRIDAL MORN. Pass we now three months It wa3 about the hour of nine, on a lovely morning in June, that a young man, in the garb of a secretary, knocked briskly at the door ol a humble and retired looking dwelling in the Raoni Square. He wore a small moustache, a pointed beard and jetty ringlets hung over his shoulders. A slender rapier hung at his side, and a short dagger dangled from his girdle. He was handsome as the term goes, and \u2014 we are afraid to believe \u2014 renew it. There was a no small share of importance in his step, and carriage ; but then he was young. He entered, sans monie, and was met in the hall by a young lady, whom we have already intro duced to the reader. \" You are one to keep a promise !\" said the young lady tossing her head indignantly. *' Nay, I could not come earlier,\" replied the secretary ; \" but we shall lose nothing by this trifling delay, for I have the doge's permission to take thee to the palace, that we may enter St. Mark's with the bridal cortege. So get thee ready as soon as may be.\" There was a mischievous light in the eyes of the secretary during this brief speech. They entered the sitting room. \" Ho! ho !\" said the secietary, as his eyes fell on some bright and gauzy orna- ments which were lying on a cushion in one corner. The maiden met his glance and blushed. She did not speak a syllable, blushed to the temples. A great deal of meaning is often conveyed in a blush. \" Nay, thou shalt wear it, my beloved,\" said the secretaiy, taking her hand and drawing her fondly to his breast, and imprinting a lover's seal upon her lips. \" So, like a fair and bewitching damsel, don it with all speed.\" Did she need a second bidding ? Ten minutes afterward, they It-: ft the house, and bent their steps in the direction of the palace. St. Mark's temple was crowded with the wives and daughters and scions of all castes in Venice. From the palace to the church was but a short distance; but that short distance was amply taken advantage of by the populace, and a crowd was collected from either side of the palace portals, to either side of the portals of the church, leaving a broad and winding passage for the nob'.e cortege. The bell of St. Mark's pealed forth inerrily^and its notes seemed to spread joyousness over the hearts and faces of the multitude. The bridal bells, the bridal bells, how merrily they rang ! Tlie palace portals were opened wide, and the gaping throng shouted as if their lungs would crack, as the bridal procession appeared,"], [90, "THE ORANGE GI RL OF VENICE. 80 \" Make way \u2014 make way !\" shouted the guards who had been posted to keep clear the passage to the temple. The throng fell back, but not unwillingly \u2014 for there was not one in that mighty throng, but would have died, if necessary, in defence of the well-beloved doge. A party of priests and altar attendants led the procession ; a score of pages following them, and the different grades of the nobility after them, till the doge in his bridal robes appeared. Then rang the echoing air with shouts and vivas and waving of caps, and kerchiefs, by tbe multitude. The doge bowed his thanks, and bis noble bearing and splendid figure well became his office, as the whispers of admiration, as he passed, well attested Almost next him, followed Calvari, secre tary to the doge, leading a young and blushing maiden, -Junetta by name; and so firm and confident wa3 his step that many believed he had no right to thc blushing one at his side. He appeared to be too confident in his carriage for a lover ; so thought and so spoke the ladies. He bore himself like a true and fearless man ; so thought and so spoke the men. The procession had reached and entered the church ; still the bells rang merrily \u2014 but where was the bride? So questioned the multitude without, so did not question the multitude within : for the bride, veiled, had entered by the vestry door, even at the moment her future lord had entered by the front. The broad aisle was cleared for the bridegroom and his party, and the bride and bridegroom met, as if by accident \u2014 but it was not by accident-vand then they strode solemnly, (people put on such solemn airs !) to a royal seat, prepared fer them on the right hand of the marble altar. The secretary and his beloved were not far off, and the parents and cousins of Junetta, by a straage coincidence, were not far away from their daughter. Every body looked grave, and almost every one blushed , although there -was but little need of either. These things will happen, despite of the,r impropriety ! The bell ceased pealing, and ere the cadence of its last note had died away, the bride and bridegroom were summoned by the priest, and the doge, Galliano, and his beloved Isabel were united for ever. The ring was placed upon the finger of the bride, and then St. Mark's temple re-echoed to the shouts of those within and the cheering of those without. The bell pealed again, and even it seemed to share in the silvery joy, so silvery were its notes. Another couple passed the ordeal of the priest, and they were cheered too, but not so loudly as the noble pair that preceded them ; still they were cheered, and a little old man and a little old woman were observed to be very (ussy, and ner- vous during the ceremony ; weeping and smiling by turns, and turning to the people and motioning them to be silent, as if they had been the cheered ones, and were more important than they were. How people will act sometimes! As the doge was leaving the church to return to the palace, his eye was observed to look anxiously around, as if in search of faces that had not yet met his eve. An expression of sadness passed athwart his brow, as if disappointed in his search. CHAPTER XXI. CONCLUSION. On a low cushioned couch, in a chamber where the luxuries ofthe higher caste contrasted strongly with the simple garniture of the lowly, reclinad the fragile form of the fa r but suffering Eugenia. The apartment had but one window, and that was adorned with a curtain of crimson gauze. It was mid-day ; and the sun-rays 6'eamjug through the curtain, cast a glowirg tint upon the conch \u2022*. which the"], [91, "THE ORANGE GIRL OE VENICE 81 orange girl reclined. Her head was leaning upon her upraised hand, and her \u00abL\u00ab fye? Sf Dg vacant'y uP\u00b0n th? mtics ofa little bird which was hopping from cross-twig to cross-twig of its wiry cag^, and singing merrily, as if to impart a cr,ZV^W% mlrthful\u00ab^ i\u00b0 heart of its fair mistress\" An eastern carpet covered trie floor ; paintings, amorous and religious, adorned the yellow coloured walls , and, like those of the wealthier classes ofthe day, the ceiling was hid by silken sheets, so disposed as to represent the ceiling of a Venetian boudoir. A small circular table stood beside the couch, whose surface was covered with low square bottles of rich wines and inspiring waters, for the reinvigorating of the feeble frame of the invalid. But these were untouched, while an earthen jar of water beside them was more than half emptied. The costume of the orange girl was composed of a simple tight-fitting frock of green velvet ; a pointed collar of worked lace, and a string of pearls around her waist. A small golden cross hung from her neck by a blue ribbon, and lay on her breast ; a bracelet of hair, No. 11."], [92, "82 THE OT? ANCE GIRL nF VENTGE. mounted with gold, encircled her left wrist, and a plain ring adorned her fore finger. Her hair was in clusters, and fell in profusion over her alabaster neck. Her feet, scarcely perceptible, were encased in slippers of green morocco, and adorned with small square silver buckles. In fine, the apartment resembled more the boudoir of some gay and coquettish belle than that of a poor deluded girl ; and the fair occupant herself some spoiled, effeminate child of titled parents, than the daughter of a poor and obscure fruit vender. But these things aside. A low knock at the door broke the reflective train of the orange girl's thoughts \" Come in,\" was the response, in a low, soft voice. The door opened, and a lady of imperial dress and beauty entered the chamber. \" How art thou, love ?\" said the latter, in a tone of affectionate anxiety. \" Better, much better,\" replied the orange girl, faintly ; \" a few days more, and I shall cease to trouble earth.\" \" Nay, Eugenie,\" rejoined her companion, playfully, \" we'll have no such me lancholy sentiment as that born in our palace household. We brought thee here to make thee happy and life-loving, and we shall not suffer thee to harbour any thought traitorous to our intentions or to happiness. Life was given us to enjoy, not to cause us misery ; and it is impiety to be wretched, when we can be happy. Thou must live for thine own sake, for ours, and for love's.\" \" Love's ? Ah, your highness !\" \"Highness! Hey-day! Mine own loved friend and companion growing cold and distant I Highness me not, Eugenie ; I am no highness to thee. To thee now, as ever, I am plain Isabel. I love thee with a sister's love, and thou, loving me the same, must call me, as heretofore, ' dear Isabel.' Because bride to the doge, am I to lose the affectionate greetings of my friends ? Marry, not I ! Friendship and love are too rare to be sacrificed so cheaply. Call me Isabel, dear Isabel, or never word speak to me again. \" Dear Isabel.\" \"There's a dear girl,\" said the other, kissing her, and twining her arms around the orange girl's neck, \"thus shalt thou call me ever. As for title, art thou not the greater highness of the two? Did not the patriols, in token of thy wrongs, use thy well known nickname as their signal cry, their watchword, to inspire each other with confidence and courage in their brave enterprise! By my troth ! 1 shall henceforth ' highness' thee, in revenge, if thou darest title me again. But I've a word for thee. Now, don't blush, but boldly guess what it is !\" \"Nay, I cannot guess.\" \" Cannot guess\u2014 my sister, Eugenie, cannot guess ! Oh, horrid! Thou a woman, and cannot guess ? Shocking ! I shall henceforth deem thee other than thou art, if thou can'st not guess ! Look in my eyes !\" \" I see nothing but love, dear Isabel !\" r \"Nothing but love! Of course not ! Galliano always says the same ; anj kisses my lips as a punishment for every such assertion. Nothing but lov M ry ! 1 want thee to see nothing else in them ! But there are other eyes could look even more fondly on thee than mine ; and my dear sister must let them do so. Come, promise me that they shall have such permission !\" \" Dear Isabel \" \" Nay, nay no treachery, my pretty little captive. Like a grim and hideous bear, 1 II hug thee into consenting. Dost thou refuse ? Nay, then, thus I keep my word ! And she clasped the orange girl affectionately to her breast. Eugenie wept. << Nay, pretty trembler,\" said her companion, in the same mock-serious tone, have I not already told thee that tears, and all other symptoms of unhappiness are treachery to our court! The edict has gone forth-' No tears here !' and wilt tbou be the first to be summoned to judgment? Come\u2014 come, my little rebel. s.* /fi.\"0 'ears~*h)s Is l.he, Palace of the Sraces> Love, Hope, and Happiness ! bee that thou rememberest it!\" ir \u2022 \" Even for joy, dear Isabel, I should weep.\""], [93, "THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICF. 83 \u2022' '\"ears are traitors to joy, sweet one. Put on thy smiles, thy brightest ones, * ,re *s a certain young lieutenant \u2014 whilom a gondolier \u2014 who desires speech with thee. He is in the ante-chamber, fretting his life away, lest his fair mistress should refuse to aecept him for her tyrant. 1 am his ambassador to the court of love, and the queen of that heart-breakiDg court must not refuse to reward him for his fidelity.\" A tear now danced in the earnest eye of Eugenie. \"Shall I bid him enter?\" said the duchess, in a tone, half playful half earnest. \" Oh, spare me\u2014 spare him! I am unfit to wed !\" exclaimed the orange girl in reply. \" Unfit to wed ! Now, by St. Mark ! thou art the very image of a simple witted child ! Unfit to wed ! Art thou not ringed and widowed \u2014 art thou not free and loving? Was life given thee to make a mockery of? Are thy friends blind to thy merits or thy virtues? Hast thou no virtues ? If ay, shouldst thou not give them to the eyes of the world, that they may be taken note of and acknow ledged ? Shalt thou for a paltry squeam refuse to live out thy appointed time as happily as possible ? Wilt thou be thine own foe ? Be wise \u2014 thy lover adores thee, loves thy very footprints, and would sacrifice his life's dearest hopes to make thee happy, to call thee his. And wilt thou do him such deep wrong as to let such devotion as his go unrewarded, unrequited ? Go to ! Foscari did thee wiong, but righted thee at last ; thou art his widow now, \u2014 in sight of heaven and earth, his widowed bride 1 Heaven and earth so look upon thee ; and so thou art, let who will gainsay it ! The doge of Venice, the dnchess, the whole court, ay, and every honest mind in Venice, will vouch the same against any caviller soever ! Wrong not thyself by flinging aside the honest heart and brave hand of him who hath ever loved thee dearer than himself.\" Eugenie still wept, and the glow of conscious shame shone on her cheeks. She reflected, and she wept while she reflected. \" Summon thy courage at once,\" said the duchess affectionately, \" and bid me call him in.'' The eyes of the orange girl and those of her friend met \u2014 it was a meaning glance \u2014\u25a0the next moment Eugenie was alone. Her eye grew calm on the instant\u2014 no gush of blood marred the alabaster hue of her brow or cheek. Her lip was pale, but firm. A light tread caught her ear \u2014 the door opened, and Gennaro, now a lieutenant in the body guard ofthe doge, was at h?r feet. They were alone. She did not bid him rise; but there was a language in her eyes which Gennaro, novice as he was in love's ambiguous tongue, understood at once. He sat by her side \u2014 her hand in his \u2014 his arm around her waist \u2014 her head bowed on his breast. Need we tell their speech, as thus they sat ? No ; there are scenes and whispers free from the profane pen of the scribe. The day following, whispers were heard in the palace of a bridal \u2014 a private bridal,\u2014 at which the doge enacted the father's part, and gave away the bride. The duchess also had a part in the matter ; and so did the lady ofthe duke's secretary. There were some tears shed before, during, and after the ceremony ; but on such occasions women have a right to weep\u2014 though we cannot tell for what. Years passed on, and a group of little boys were assembled in the private garden of the ducal palace. They were a merry little group, and were wrestling for a wreath which a lovely girl, in the simple costume of an orange vendor, who stood in the centre of a green plat, held in her hand. A young fellow, about twelve years of age, who called himself her little husband, won the prize, and, like a true little knight, knelt at the feet of the little beauty, while she placed it, gracefully, amid the shouts ofthe little party, upon his brow, A party of ladies and gentlemen were sitting on cushioned benches in the balcony gazing with affectionate anxiety on the scene.
