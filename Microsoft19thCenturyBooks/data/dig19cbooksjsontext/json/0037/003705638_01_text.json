With Omar, as with most great poets, it is the metaphysical side of his writing which chiefly interests and concerns us ; but his utterances appear so contradictory that at a first reading they are even bewildering. I have therefore tried to give the result of my study of the poet in a form that may help readers who might otherwise grope in the dark to find his point of view. Most of us know Omar through the pages of his paraphraser, Edward FitzGerald, whose beautiful rendering is now one of our most cherished classics ; but the fascination exercised by FitzGerald is not wanting in Omar himself, as a studv of literal translations will soon convince vii"], [14, "VIII PREFACE the inquirer who is not able to read him in the original Persian. And the chief reason of this fascination is not far to seek. Nothing is more impressive than to find ourselves, our emotions, our doubts, our immature beliefs depicted by a great soul that has been for nearly eight hundred years numbered with the immortal dead ; in him we see reflected our own heart searchings, and are not a little touched by them. But it is necessary to recollect, as I shall presently point out, that all which passes under his name was not written by Omar ; and it is to be hoped that some competent scholar may at an early day depart so far from the ordinary routine as to give us, as nearly as it may be done, the real Omar of the eleventh century. We do not want new metrical translations so much as a judicious sifting of texts which might leave a residuum genuine beyond dispute. The difficulties should not be insuperable, and the task is obviously one which should be attempted.

Finally, there seems to come old age, with its measure of submission to indisputable laws, and its lament for inevitable death.

It is around these towns, therefore, that our interest in contemporary history must centre. In Omar's day \u2014 that is, in the eleventh century \u2014 both these towns belonged to the province of Khorasan in the north-east of Persia. They were then the pride and glory of the Mohammedan East ; but now, alas ! Merv is but a heap of crumbling ruins, while Nishapur, though still boasting a population of some ten thousand souls, is a mere collection of low houses built of unburnt bricks, and retains nothing of its former splendour. Khorasan was one of Persia's fairest provinces, and Oriental geographers are unanimous in their praises of its climate and"], [24, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 6 its fertility. Nishapur itself was a most pro sperous town, and famous as a centre alike of learning and of commerce.1 At the beginning of the eleventh century the temporal power of the Caliph was practi cally at an end, and the realm of Islam was split up into a number of small dynasties, who, though acknowledging in a half-hearted manner the spiritual power of the Commander of the Faithful, were practically independent. Africa, Egypt, Spain, and Syria were in the hands of different rulers, while Persia was ruled partly by various princes of the House of Buwayh (of whom we shall speak again below), and partly by the powerful Turkish dynasty known as the Ghaznavid. The most famous prince of this dynasty \u2014 and, indeed, one of the most brilliant figures in Mohammedan history \u2014 Mahmud, son of Sebuktagin, had received the fair province of Khorasan as a gift from the puppet Caliph who was not strong enough to 1 A summary of the accounts of Nishapur to be found in old Geographies is given in Mr. Payne's Introduction to his Translation of the Ruba'iyat, published by the Villon Society."], [25, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 7 claim possession of it himself. It is during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazna (998-1030) that the Seljuk Turks first appear in Mohammedan annals ; and since it is with them that the history of Khorasan in the eleventh century is most concerned, it is fitting in this place briefly to describe their origin and the growth of their power.1 Towards the end of the tenth century a pastoral tribe of Turks, whose temporary habitat had been Turkestan, finding their former pas turage insufficient for their flocks and herds, crossed the river Jaxartes under the leadership of Seljuk their chief, and entered the Oxus country, where they occupied the districts round about Samarkand and Bokhara, and here. we are told, they embraced Islam. Not long after this Mahmud of Ghazna allowed them to cross the Oxus and to settle in the neighbour hood of Nisa and Abivard.2 The origin of these 1 There is perhaps no more delightful chapter in Gibbon's great masterpiece than the fifty-seventh, which deals with the rise of the Seljuks. 2 Great confusion exists with regard to the early history of the Seljuks.

During the reign of Mahmud, Transoxania and Khorasan were entirely overrun by foreign pastoral tribes, comprising the Seljuks, and probably, in still greater numbers, other branches of the Ghuz. In 1029 \u2014 a year before the death of Mahmud \u2014 we hear of a successful expedition being conducted by him against the Seljuks, who had apparently transgressed the limits of the wishing to embarrass the reader with the details of a period of history which still awaits elucidation at the hands of scholars. Oriental historians not only contradict one another but even themselves. Some maintain that the Seljuks did not enter Khorasan till the reign of Mas'ud. 1 It is noticeable that most of the Seljuk leaders at this period have Jewish names, such as David, Michael, Moses, and Israel. 2 Their father Michael! had predeceased Seljuk, who is said to have died at the age of 107."], [27, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 9 pasturage he had allowed them to occupy. The results of this punitive expedition were not lasting ; for on the death of Mahmud, his son Mas'ud found his whole attention engrossed by the disturbed state of Khorasan. At first he tried to pacify the shepherd hordes by granting them fresh pastures ; but this action only led to great discontent on the part of the sedentary population of that province, who were thus left at the mercy of these nomads, and in 1034, while Mas'ud was absent in India, they rose in revolt against the House of Ghazna. In the following year, however, Mas'ud marched up into Khorasan, and not only quelled the revolt, but also succeeded in driving back the Ghuz beyond Tus and Nishapur. Hitherto we have known the Seljuks as a nomadic tribe with no thought or aims beyond securing good pasturage for their flocks : we see them advancing westwards, it is true, but only doing so as a result of a force majeure, and certainly not in the guise of 'world conquerors ' ; but we have now reached the turning-point in their history, and suddenly"], [28, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 10 they are transformed from shepherds to warriors, while their chiefs pass without any apparent transitional state from being the leaders of nomadic hordes to be rulers of a mighty empire, who, instead of craving leave to pasture their flocks on new ground, thunder at the gates of capitals and dictate treaties to em perors and caliphs. Having driven the Ghuz back into the north of Khorasan, Mas'ud returned to Ghazna. Some historians tell us that in his expedition against the Ghuz Mas'ud had been helped by the Seljuks : however this may be, no sooner was Mas'ud's back turned than the Seljuks, under the leadership of the brothers Toghrul and Chakir,1 rose in arms against the Ghaznavid lieutenants, and in a short time made them selves masters of the whole of this province. In the year 1037 Merv surrendered to Chakir, and in the following year Toghrul seized Nishapur. Mas'ud and his successors made 1 He is sometimes called by his other name Da'ud.

Toghrul, having thus in the year 1037 practi cally secured for himself the possession of the much-coveted province of Khorasan, next turned his attention to the conquest of the rest of Persia, which, as we have seen above, was divided among the various branches of the House of Buwayh. The Buwayhids owed their rise to power to a dynasty known as the Ziyarids, founded by Mardawij ibn Ziyar in 928, who ruled over the Caspian provinces of Jurjan and Tabaristan. In 1041 Toghrul overthrew their last representative Anushirwan, and made him his vassal. The history of the Buwayhids or Daylamites, as they are also called, is buried in a mass of confused detail, and it is difficult to form an estimate of the power and influence of their different representatives. Some of them were at any rate strong enough to intimidate the"], [30, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 12 Caliphs of Baghdad, who became mere puppets in their hands, though treated by them with an outward show of respect. At no period of their history could the Buwayhids be regarded as a united whole, and civil strife was with them the permanent order of the day. Never- theless, though they had not the wisdom to unite their scattered forces, they individually made a bold and determined stand against the advancing Seljuks. Toghrul, however, finally made himself master of all their States, and in 1055 entered Baghdad itself, where he caused his name to be proclaimed as Sultan of his newly won empire, which included Persia, Mesopo tamia, Syria, and Asia Minor. The occupation of these countries by his Turkish followers resembled rather a vast immigration than a conquest. The last episode in Toghrul's life was his official marriage with the Caliph's daughter, by which union he wished to make more secure the attachment to himself of his Turkish soldiers, who had the utmost veneration for the person of the Caliph, in spite of the fallen state of the"], [31, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 13 House of 'Abbas. The alacrity with which the Turks always accepted Islam is very remarkable, but it admits of easy explanation. They were a simple, and at the same time a warlike, race, and for such there could be no more fitting religion than the Mohammedan creed in its simplest form \u2014 the creed that at its very outset had appealed so forcibly to the warlike Bedouins of Arabia. The Turk always adopted Islam in the orthodox Sunni form : he cared neither for metaphysics nor religious speculation : if he became a fanatic this was perhaps due to the very simplicity of his character. It was quite otherwise with the Persian. While the Turk, on the one hand, became an orthodox Musul man 1 because that religion pleased and suited him, the Persian accepted Islam only because he was forced to do so, and his ' faith,' always of an unorthodox order, became as it were a peg on which to hang some speculative system. 1 Toghrul Beg is credited with having said : ' I should be ashamed before God if I were to build me a house and not build a mosque beside it.' See el-Bondari; ed. Houtsma, p. 27."], [32, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 14 While Toghrul was engaged in the West in suppressing revolt and in consolidating the empire he had (almost unconsciously) founded, he had left his Eastern States in the charge of his brother Chakir. On the death of the latter in 1060, Alp Arslan, the son of Chakir, was appointed to the Governorship of the East, and when, in 1063, Toghrul died, leaving no male issue, Alp Arslan succeeded to the Seljuk throne. One of the first acts of his reign was to place in sole charge of the administration of the State Nizam ul-Mulk, a minister of whom any nation at any period might be justly proud. Hasan, the son of 'Ali, better known to history as Nizam ul-Mulk or Order of the State \u2014 a title con ferred on him when he rose to power \u2014 was born in Tus (the modern Meshed) probably in 1018. He early showed signs of promise, and we are told that at the age of eleven he knew the Koran by heart. While still young he began his training for an official career, and we first hear of him professionally as secretary to the Governor of Balkh, who however treated him so meanly that Nizam ul-Mulk wearied of his"], [33, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 15 service and fled to Merv, where he was warmly received by Chakir, who made him secretary and adviser to his son, Alp Arslan. When the latter, on the death of his father, became Governor of the Eastern Provinces, he chose Nizam ul-Mulk as his Grand Vezir. The great minister was now forty-two years of age, and it is from this date that his powerful and bene ficial activity in the political world begins, which continued down to his tragic death in 1104. It is impossible to overestimate the indebtedness of the Seljuks to Nizam ul-Mulk for the con solidation of their empire, both by the estab lishment of justice and by an exercise of religious tolerance. Alp Arslan, like his father and his uncle, was before all things a soldier ; and a monarch who was continually engaged in repel ling enemies from his borders, or in adding fresh territories to his empire, was obliged to leave the internal affairs of State in the hands of some trusted minister. The power therefore of Nizam ul-Mulk during the reign of Alp Arslan was almost absolute. Under his able administration Mohammedan Asia may be said to have enjoyed"], [34, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 16 for the last time an intellectual and spiritual renaissance. Nizam ul-Mulk was a Persian, and as such he realised that if the Seljuks wished to govern the Persians in peace they must allow them religious freedom.1 Though doubtless from force of circumstances he subscribed to one or other of the orthodox Sunni sects, he would from his nationality feel kindly dis- posed towards the Shi'ites. It was, however, no easy task for the great minister to exercise a spirit of religious tolerance, and still keep on good terms with all parties ; and no doubt it 1 The Turks themselves, as we have already seen, had become the strictest of the orthodox, and under the rule of Toghrul, guided by his Grand Vezir, 'Amid el-Kunduri, who was a fanatic Sunni, strong repressive measures had been taken not only against Shi'ites but even the Sunni sect of the Ash'aris. Such is the commonly received view of el-Kunduri ; it is however noticeable that Kazwini says that Toghrul was a Mo'tazilite and el-Kunduri a Shi'ite; and that they caused maledictions to be uttered on all the orthodox sects from the pulpits on Fridays, so that many orthodox men fled the country in disgust, returning, however, on the accession of Melik Shah. See Athar el-Bilad under headings Kundur and Nishapur. It is quite possible that the facts have been distorted by historians, and that it was enactments against certain Sunni sects that Nizam ul-Mulk repealed. The oldest authority, however, 'Imad ud-Din of Ispahan, says that el-Kunduri was at one time a fanatical Hanafi. (Cf. el-Bondari ; ed. Houtsma, p. 30. )"], [35, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 17 demanded on his part a certain amount of that hypocritical byplay which so often forms the butt of Omar's satire. Nizam ul-Mulk' s encour agement of letters and learning was no less striking than his administrative ability. He founded and endowed with his own money colleges in Baghdad, Basra, Isfahan, Nishapur and Herat, and many other towns. Kazwini (At/tar el-Bilad ; ed. Wiistenfeld, p. 276) thus relates the origin of these colleges : \u2014 ' When Alp Arslan entered the town of Nishapur he happened to pass by the gateway of a mosque, and there he saw a group of the doctors of the law in ragged garments, who neither saluted the Sultan nor blessed him. The Sultan asked Nizam ul-Mulk who they were, to which the Vezir replied : \" Th ese men are students of science, and spiritually they are the most noble of men : they take no delight in things of this world, and their garb bears witness to their poverty.\" Having thus softened the Sultan's heart towards them, he continued : \" If the Sultan would permit it, I would build them an establishment and grant them a sufficiency so r."], [36, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 18 that they might busy themselves with the pur suit of science, and invoke blessings on the Sultan.\" ' And the Sultan gave his permission, and Nizam ul-Mulk ordered colleges to be built throughout the Sultan's domains, and he spent a tenth part of his salary as Vezir on the building of these colleges. He was the first to establish this laudable custom. The most famous of these was the Nizamiyya College in Baghdad, com pleted in 1065, which counted among its teachers some of the leading doctors and philosophers of the day, such as the Imam Abu Ishak of Shiraz and el-Ghazali, who was known as the ' Proof of Islam ' (see below, p. 48). While laying stress on the beneficial effects of Nizam ul-Mulk' s administration, we must not forget that it followed, in Khorasan, fast upon the rule of one of the greatest patrons of letters the Mohammedan world has ever known \u2014 Mahmud of Ghazna. The advent of the Seljuks probably had but little effect upon the town populations of Khorasan ; and while the Turkish hordes were passing through that province, settling for a time upon rich pastures, but always"], [37, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 19 pressing on westwards in the character of war riors or emigrants to swell the armies or the colonies of their great chieftains, such towns as Nishapur remained practically unchanged. What did it matter to them to which branch of the Turks their king belonged ? Who cared whether the capital was Ghazna, Merv, or Baghdad ? Nevertheless, amongst all the vicissitudes and changes of the eleventh century, if there was one thing that affected the people of Nishapur, it was the presence of Nizam ul-Mulk at the head of the State. To Alp Arslan is due the honour of having led the first Turkish army across the Euphrates, and of thus laying the foundation stone of Turk ish rule in Western Asia. He was engaged during the greater part of his reign in a * holy war' against the Christians on his western borders, and he completed the conquest of Georgia and Armenia which had been begun by his uncle Toghrul. Finally, in 1071, having defeated the Emperor Romanus Diogenes, he returned to Nishapur with the intention of pushing his conquests eastwards across the Oxus :"], [38, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 20 his career was, however, cut short in the following year by a mortal wound received at the hands of a man whom he had condemned to death. And now there came to the Seljuk throne, at the age of eighteen, the most brilliant prince of a brilliant line, Melik Shah. The young king not only retained Nizam ul-Mulk in his office, but gave him, we are told, even greater power and authority than he had hitherto enjoyed. During this reign the Seljuk dynasty reached the zenith of its might and splendour. Though the Caliph in Baghdad remained the spiritual head of Islam, it was Melik Shah who might now with more justice be called the Commander of the Faithful : Baghdad with its Caliph had become, as it were, a detail in the vast Seljuk empire. Under the direction of Nizam ul-Mulk the finances of the State were placed upon an orderly basis, and trade was promoted and en couraged by the abolition of prohibitive duties, the construction of new roads and canals, and by measures taken to secure the safety of persons and property. We must not fail, however, to give due credit to Melik Shah personally for"], [39, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 21 his share in the internal development of his State, for he seems not only to have inherited the military ability of his father, but to have possessed administrative powers of the highest order, though it is of course difficult for us to determine to what extent he and his famous minister were respectively responsible for the advancement of science, learning, trade, and justice during his reign. As a general Melik Shah was so successful both in the East and in the West, that at the height of his power he held sway from ' the frontiers of China up to the gates of Constantinople.' The one dark page in the history of Melik Shah is his treatment of Nizam ul-Mulk, whom he is said to have degraded after nearly twenty years of faithful service and personal devotion.1 The cause of the misunderstanding that arose between them is variously stated by historians, but from all accounts it appears that it was in- 1 This is the generally accepted story.

Seeing how intimately the name of Hasan-i- Sabbah is connected with that of Omar Khayyam, and seeing further how important a part he and his * Assassins ' played in the history of the time, a short account of the rise of this strange sect will not here be considered out of place. It is well known that very early in its history Islam was divided into the two rival factions of Sunnites and Shi'ites. Their disagreement arose on the question of the successors of the Prophet. The Sunni or orthodox faction recognised the legitimacy of the four Caliphs who succeeded 1 It appears that in the same year Nizam ul-Mulk planned an attack on Alamut, the stronghold of the Assassins, which was unsuccessful.

The Omayyads ruled in Damascus and the 'Abbasids in Baghdad. The Shi'ites, however, on the death of 'Ali supported the claims of 'Ali's descendants. In their eyes the most important duty in the world was to have an ' imam ' or spiritual guide of the house of this son-in-law of the Prophet. They regarded all the other Caliphs as usurpers, while the first three became, and have since remained, the objects of their curses.

From this they received the name of 'Twelvers.' The Shi'ites, however, gradually became divided into various sects. In fact, disputes arose in regard to the rightful successor of each imam as he died, and some times even before he died.

The house of 'Abbas, indeed, made it a rule to mistrust the Arabs, while they placed implicit trust in the Persians. The Omayyad Caliph Sulayman (715) is credited with the following pithy saying: \u2014 'I am amazed at these Persians ; they have ruled a thousand years and never needed us for a moment ; while we have reigned a hundred years, and have never been able to do without them for a moment.'

Isma'il himself was regarded as an imam although he predeceased his father, Ja'far, who died in 765. 1 The Isma'ili faction found but a small follow ing at first, and seemed, indeed, to be on the point of disappearing altogether, when it was suddenly resuscitated by a Persian named 'Ab dullah, son of Maymun.

His scheme was to unite in a secret society, in which there were different degrees of initiation, men of all modes and shades of opinion, from the most superstitious sectarian to the free-thinker : to hold this body together by the bonds of mystery and secrecy, and to reduce its members to a state of passive obedience, and thus to prepare a force which should eventually overthrow the ruling powers and finally undermine Islam.

These missionaries gave them selves out for pious men, and excited the curiosity of their hearers by asking them difficult ques tions on religious matters, which they would afterwards explain allegorically in a manner best suited to mystify their audience.

His curiosity being aroused, the listener would ask to knowr more, whereupon the missionary would reply : ' I can only tell you more on condi tion that you bind yourself to me by a solemn 1 We are told that he had already, with the help of his conjuring tricks, tried to give himself out as a prophet, but had failed to convince his audiences !"], [46, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 28 oath : in that case I may tell you something to your advantage.' Thanks to 'Abdullah's activity the Isma'ili creed soon spread far and wide, and in 909 this movement led to the foundation of the Fatimid dynasty in Africa, which continued till 1171, when their last Caliph was supplanted by Saladin. I cannot in this place enter more fully into the rise and progress of the Isma'ilis ; the above sketch is only intended to serve as an introduction to the remarkable career of Hasan-i-Sabbah, who, as is well known, was a contemporary, and perhaps a school-fellow, of Omar Khayyam.1 The father of Hasan-i-Sabbah lived in the town of Ray (near the modern Teheran), and was an adherent of the Shi'ite sect of the 'Twelvers.' In order, it appears, to avert the suspicions of infidelity that were harboured against him, he sent his son Hasan to school 1 According to the popular story, he studied along with Nizam ul-Mulk and Omar Khayyam under the Imam Muwaf fak, who was upwards of eighty years of age.

Five years later he set out for Egypt, and in 1078 we find him studying at the Isma'ili ' Lodge ' in Cairo, where he remained a year and a half, returning to Ispahan in 1080. He now began to devote all his energies to spread ing the Isma'ili teaching throughout Persia, sending missionaries in all directions and win ning personal and devoted attachment on all sides. Finally, in 1090, he by ruse made himself master of one of the most impreg nable fortresses in Northern Persia, called Alamut, situated not far from Kazwin. This fort now became the headquarters of that State within the State to the foundation of which Hasan had during the last ten years been devoting his untiring energies. From Herat up to the Tigris and throughout Persia i Kazwini (Athar el-Bilad, under 'Alamut') says: 'Hasan i-Sabbah was learned in philosophy, astronomy, geometry, and magic. Nizam ul-Mulk honoured him for his learning.' From this passage it would appear that Kazwini had never heard of the story of the three school-friends.

At this period, Hasan, having definitely ceased to hold communica tion with the Grand Lodge at Cairo, founded an independent Order, a sort of Brother hood, with a constitution of its own. There were five different grades of membership: first came the Grand Master himself; second the chief Da'is ; third the Da'is; fourth the Companions who were Da'is in their novitiate ; and finally the Fida'is,1 who carried out the orders of their chiefs : Assassins, themselves con demned to die. It was these Assassins who became the terror of the whole Mohammedan world ; their victims were generally tyrannical rulers and enemies of the Order. The Fida'is were recruited from among the finest youths in the country. Their membership and their allegiance were for the most part received in 1 There were two further grades : the sixth, a sort of sub division of Fida'is ; while the seventh included all lay converts.

In the midst of these delights the young man was conveyed back in a state of intoxica tion to the room in which he had been first entertained ; and on recovering his senses he was assured by his host that he had never quitted the room, but that his spirit had been given a foretaste of the joys of Paradise which were reserved for those who were willing to sacrifice their lives for the ' Faith.'

With the death of Melik Shah the Seljuk empire as a consoli dated whole practically ceased to exist ; and although the main line preserved till the death of Sanjar, in 1157, a nominal suzerainty, various branches of the Seljuk family now obtained entire independence in different parts of the empire. The twenty-five years that elapsed between the death of Melik Shah and the acces sion of Sultan Sanjar were mainly characterised by disorder and civil war. Of the four Sultans who reigned during this period the most impor tant was Berkiyaruk (1094-1 104).1 During his reign two important events occurred in Nisha pur.

They persuaded Berkiyaruk to make an attempt to suppress this murderous band before it was too late, pointing out that if he did not take active measures, the suspicions already harboured against him of being a partisan of the Isma'ilis might spread more widely and cause his down fall. Such considerations led Berkiyaruk in the 1 An heretical sect founded by Abu 'Abdullah Mohammed al Kerrami, who attempted to introduce into the Moham- ledan creed anthropomorphic doctrines. 2 See Ibn el-Athir, anno 488."], [53, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 35 year 1101 to command, or at any rate permit, a general massacre of the Isma'ilis.

Feeling his end ap proaching, he made his army take the oath of fidelity to his infant son, Melik Shah n., but the young prince was taken prisoner by his uncle Mohammed, who now ascended the Seljuk throne. His reign, which lasted thirteen years, was remarkable only for civil disturbances, and for the wars which his generals conducted in Syria against the Crusaders, who were at that period trying to deliver Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the hands of the Mohammedans.

Before introducing these extracts it is my duty to mention that the oldest Tezkiret, or 'Lives of the Poets,' that has come down to us, that of 'Awfi (written about 1200 a. n.), makes no mention of Omar Khayyam. This of course does not prove that 'Awfi was unacquainted with Omar's quatrains, but only that he did not consider the famous astronomer and mathematician, who after all wrote but very little poetry, deserving a place among the great poets of Khorasan. Nor does Dawlat Shah,1 writing much later, devote a separate article to Omar, but only mentions him incidentally in connection with another poet. 1 The text of his famous Tezkiret ush-Shu'ara, or ' Lives of the Poets,' will be shortly published by Mr. E.

So he brought me out to the Hira cemetery ; I turned to the left, and his tomb lay at the foot of a garden wall, over which pear trees and peach-trees thrust their heads, and on his grave had fallen so many flower-leaves that his dust was hidden beneath the flowers. Then I remembered that saying which I had heard from him in the city of Balkh, and I fell to weeping, because on the face of the earth, and in all the regions of the habitable globe, I no where saw one like unto him. May God (blessed and exalted is He) have mercy upon him, by His Grace and His Favour !

Mr. Browne2 has further suggested that Omarians have been wrong in supposing that it was rose leaves that covered Omar's grave, but that it was the blossom of fruit-trees ; for the Persian word gul is applied not merely to ' roses ' but to every flower.

But their inner meaning is a stinging serpent to the Holy Law. But since the people of his day reviled him for his religion, and exposed to view the secrets he had veiled from them, he feared for his blood and reined the bridle of his tongue and pen.

(a) Of the accounts of Omar contained in works written after the fourteenth century only one has been discovered which tells us anything fresh about him.1 This is contained in a Uni versal History called the Tarikh-i-Alfi, or ' Mil lennium History,' so called because it was intended to bring the narrative of events down to the year one thousand of the Hijra \u2014 i.e. the end of the sixteenth century. Here we read as follows 2 : \u2014 ' Omar Khayyam, the Wise, belongs to the most learned men of Khorasan. In philosophy he is considered to rank close to Avicenna.

I have however retained the version, for curiously enough I found on comparison that this so-called 'abridgment' is rather fuller and more accurate in this particular passage than the original."], [75, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 57 we learn that Omar was born in Nishapur, and that his ancestors were also Nishapuris. Some, however, maintain that he came from the village of Shamsad, a dependency of Balkh, and that he was actually born in the village of Basank, a dependency of Astarabad. However this may be, during the greater part of his life Nishapur was his home. By reason of his avarice and his parsimoniousness in the spreading of science, he did not produce many works. One of his pamphlets, entitled \"The Balance of Judgment\" (Nizam ul-Hukm), on the testing of the value of objects set with precious stones without re moving the stones,1 gained a certain celebrity ; as did another pamphlet entitled \" Needs of Places\" (Lawazim ul-Amkina), which deals with the definition of the four seasons of the year, and the causes of variance of the climatic con ditions in different towns and countries. From most of his works it is apparent that Omar believed in the transmigration of the soul.

They asked the \"Master\" the cause of this. He said: \"The soul which is attached to the body of this ass was formerly in the body of a teacher in this seminary ; he was therefore unable to enter, but now that he knows that his colleagues have recognised him, he cannot help but enter.\" ' In this place the writer appends a short ver sion of the story of the Three School Friends."], [77, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 59 The Tarikh-i-AlJi is arranged under the head ings of each successive year.

(b) In the liiyaz ush-Shu'ara, or ' Paradise of Poets,' a biographical anthology written in a.d. 1748, we find the following short notice of Omar J : \u2014 ' He was one of the most learned of men, and during his life he was held in such high esteem that Sultan Sanjar used to make him sit beside him on his throne. In his youth he was at the same school with Nizam ul-Mulk and Hasan-i- Sabbah. At the beginning of his life he was very strict and pious in his religion, but in later days he exposed himself to blame ; for he drank purple wine from the goblet of knowledge, and he was continually drunk and senseless. ' They say that after his death, his mother was continually supplicating God with tears and laments to forgive him. One night Omar appeared to his mother in a dream, and recited the following quatrain to her : \u2014 1 British Museum, Add. 16,729, sol. 155 a."], [78, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 60 ' \" O thou who art consumed [with grief] for one who burns [in Hell fire] and deserves to burn, O thou who thyself also wilt feed the flames of hell, How long wilt thou continue to pray, ' Have mercy on Omar'? Were you supposed to teach God forgiveness ? \" This anecdote is to be found in several mss. and lithographed editions of Omar. The story of Omar's intimacy with Sultan Sanjar is also to be found in later works such as the Atash Kada, the well-known poetical anthology of Lutf 'Ali Beg, compiled in the last century. What is chiefly remarkable in the above short biography is the entire disregard shown by its author for chronology. Other writers, indeed, see no difficulty in making Omar of the same age as Nizam ul-Mulk, who was born in 1017, and also the friend of Sultan Sanjar, who came to the throne in 1117; but the author of the Riya; ush-Shu ara goes yet further in maintaining that Omar predeceased his mother. I shall deal with the chronological difficulties below. (c) The two great Arabic Chronicles of Ibn el- Athir and of Abu-1-Feda both make an allusion to Omar as an astronomer. Since they agree"], [79, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 61 with one another substantially, I will only quote the older work. Ibn el-Athir (Katnil; ed. Tornberg, x. 67) writes : \u2014 ' In the year 1074 Nizam ul-Mulk and Sultan Melik Shah held a gathering of all the leading astronomers of the day ; and they fixed the New Year's Day at the first point of Aries ; hitherto it had been fixed at the season when the sun had half traversed Pisces. And this de cision of the Sultan's became the starting-point of the Calendars. In this same year astronomi cal observations were made for Sultan Melik Shah, and a number of the leading astronomers, such as Omar ibn Ibrahim el-Khayyami, Abu-1 Muzaffar el-Isfizari, and Maymun ibn el-Najib el- Wasiti and others, assisted in the undertaking, and the Sultan spent large sums of money on it. These observations of the heavens were continued until the death of the Sultan in a.h. 485 (a.d. 1092), but after that event they came to an end.' Such is all the material that has at present been discovered for a biography of Omar"], [80, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 62 Khayyam. From the above extracts we learn what manner of man Omar was, where he lived, and who were his contemporaries. We are, however, still left entirely in the dark as to the date of his birth, while the date of his death is variously given as a. h. 505 (a.d. 1111) and a.h. 517 (a.d. 1123). Most authorities favour the latter date. Let us now consider from internal evidence the possible or probable time of his birth. The one indication we possess is the famous story of the Three School-fellows, Nizam ul-Mulk, Hasan-i-Sabbah, and Omar Khayyam. This story is familiar to all Omarians, for it is given in extenso in FitzGerald's ' Introduction.' I shall therefore not do more than summarise the facts briefly. Nizam ul-Mulk, Hasan-i-Sabbah, and Omar Khayyam were all of one age, and in their youth studied together in Nishapur under the Imam MuwafFak,1 then aged eighty-five. There was a 1 This is probably the same Muwaffak, ' father of Abu Sahl,' referred to in cl-Bondari (p. 30), where we read : \u2014 El-Kunduri became acquainted with Toghrul Bey n the following manner : when Toghrul Bey came to Nishapur he was in want of a"], [81, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 63 general belief that the pupils of the Imam generally attained to fortune : so the three friends formed a compact that whichever of them should attain to fortune should help the other two. When Nizam ul-Mulk became Vezir to Alp Arslan (see p. 15), Omar came to him and reminded him of their covenant. Omar refused to accept a post at court, but accepted a yearly stipend of twelve hundred gold miscals, after which he retired to Nishapur and devoted him self to astronomy and other sciences. Later on in the reign of Melik Shah he came to Merv and was treated with much honour, on account of his learning, by the Sultan. The story further relates how Hasan-i-Sabbah also presented him self to Nizam ul-Mulk, by whose influence he obtained a post at court ; and how he afterwards turned against his friend, and went and joined the Isma'ilis. scribe who was well acquainted with Arabic and Persian, and so Muwaffak, father of Abi Sahl, recommended el-Kunduri to the Sultan ; that is in the year 1038. We also hear of this Muwaffak in 1042. See Schefer's Suppl. Siasset Nameh, p. 115 ; see also Ibn el-Athir (anno 456), who here closely follows Imad ud-Din's History, or perhaps el-Bondari's abridgment, with which he in places agrees verbally. El-Bondari wrote his work in 1226 ; Ibn el-Athir in 1231."], [82, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 64 Now this story was for a long time accepted by Western scholars, in spite of the chrono- logical difficulties it involves, because the work in which they found it, the Wasaya of Nizam ul-Mulk, was considered genuine and authori- tative. It was, moreover, copied by all the later historians. Scholars had, however, in the first instance, only known the Wasaya story as quoted by the famous Persian historian Mirkhwand. When they came to examine the Wasaya itself they found that it was merely a compilation written in the fifteenth century and dedicated to a descendant in the twelfth degree of the great Vezir.1 Scholars were then inclined to reject the story altogether as apocryphal;2 and M. Houtsma of Leyden suggested that the compiler of the Wasaya had been confusing 1 See Rieu's Catalogue of the Persian MSS. in the British Museum, p. 446. 2 The author of the Dabistan-i-Mazahib, a seventeenth century work on the religions of the world, while accepting the first part of the story, contradicts the latter part. He charges the Vezir with utter disregard of his boyish bargain, and relates that when Omar came before him, Nizam ul-Mulk refused to help him : that Hasan-i-Sabbah waited long before he gained recognition, and, when the Vezir had been shamed into promoting him, he lost no time in intriguing against Hasan, and driving him from court.

This theory, in so far as it concerns the compiler of the Wasaya, had to be abandoned when Mr. Browne pointed out that the story was already current in the fourteenth century l (see page 55). I consider that it is still possible that some one else may have started the legend, supposing it to be apocryphal, by confusing the two Vezirs. I am inclined to reject the story on two grounds: firstly, because the oldest historians make no mention of it ; and secondly, on account of the improbability, though there is of course no question of the impossibility, of Omar and Hasan-i-Sabbah having lived to such an old age. Let us nevertheless consider the con clusions to which this story would lead us. According to most accounts Nizam ul-Mulk was born in 1017 ; it is in that year, therefore, 1 The /ami' ut-Tawarikh, as we have seen, was completed in 1310. Kazwini wrote the second edition of his geography in 1276, and it is evident that he had never heard the story, for had he known it he must have alluded to it in his bio graphical notices of the three men concerned. E"], [84, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 66 or thereabouts, that we must place the birth of both Omar and Hasan-i-Sabbah. Now Omar is said to have died in 1123, while Hasan-i-Sabbah died in 1 124. They would then have been aged respectively one hundred and six and one hundred and seven years. Now, if any indication were forthcoming which would enable us to place the birth of either Hasan or Omar at a later date, we should be inclined to welcome it as enabling us to pro nounce more finally on the genuineness or the spuriousness of the story of the three. To prove that Hasan-i-Sabbah had not been at school with Nizam ul-Mulk were sufficient to destroy all belief in the ' story,' and this, I think, even if it cannot be proved, can at least be asserted on testimony more reliable than the authorities for the 'story.' There have by good fortune been pre served to us, though only at second hand, the memoirs of a famous Vezir named Anushirwan ibn Khalid, to whom we have already referred above (page 32). These memoirs were written in Persian, and contained a relation of the principal events of the author's lifetime, namely,"], [85, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 67 from the reign of Melik Shah to the death of Toghrul ibn Mohammed (1072-1134). This work was translated into Arabic by a famous historian, Tmad-ud-Din of Ispahan,1 and embodied by him in his history of the Seljuks. This history was in turn re-edited in an abridged form by el-Bondari in the thirteenth century. This third redaction was published by M. Houtsma in 1889- On page 66 of the Arabic text we find an interesting account in the words of Anushirwan of the rise of the Isma'ilis. Now this chapter is not merely valuable as a contemporary account of the rise of Hasan-i-Sabbah' s murderous Order, but it contains a most valuable allusion to the youth and education of Hasan himself. For although Hasan is nowhere mentioned by name, it is, as M. Houtsma points out in his preface, impossible not to recognise his identity in the words of Anushirwan. ' And in the course of events, a wonderful thing happened ; for a number of persons who had grown up like our selves, and had meted with our measure,2 and 1 He was one of Saladin's secretaries. - An expression apparently meaning that they were of the same social standing."], [86, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 68 were at school with us, and had taken much delight in the law and polite learning, separated from us. Among them was a man of Ray, who travelled into the world, and was a scribe by profession, but he hid his \" affairs.\" Finally he rose in open revolt, and in a short time made himself master of impregnable fortresses and castles ; and he instigated murders and violent acts in the most atrocious ways. And their \" affairs \" were hidden from the people, and continued to be so until their secrecy was assured.' 1 Now it is difficult to interpret this passage in any other sense than indicating that the Vezir Anushirwan was at school with Hasan-i-Sabbah. Unfortunately we do not know the date of the Vezir's birth ; the first date in his life whicli he himself records is 1095, when he took part in a battle, and was therefore a grown man. Hasan-i- Sabbah, as we have seen, took the Isma'ili oath in 1071 ; Khorasan was not his home, and since we are told that he took the oath at the hands of a missionary in Khorasan, it is fair to presume 1 I have already quoted another passage from this chapter (page 32)."], [87, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 69 that he joined that sect while at Nishapur, or at any rate just after leaving school. He may therefore, in 1071, have been twenty years of age (or even younger), and on these premises we could not put his birth further back than 1052. I think it quite possible, therefore, that Hasan i-Sabbah and Anushirwan ibn Khalid were born about 1050, that they were at school together in Nishapur, and that somebody in the following century, with an eye for the picturesque, re membering that Nizam ul-Mulk had been the patron of Omar,1 and the first victim of the Assassins, and that another great Vezir, namely, Anushirwan, had been at school with Hasan-i- Sabbah, and that all four had studied at Nishapur, consciously or unconsciously, confused the two Vezirs and started the ' story ' as we now have it of the Three School Friends.

It is at any rate notice able that Anushirwan makes no allusion to any friendship even having existed between Hasan-i- Sabbah and Nizam ul-Mulk. I have now stated all the evidence that is at present at our disposal, and it is for the reader to decide whether he will retain or reject the story of Nizam ul-Mulk and the dates it involves. Of positive dates in Omar's life we have but two : 1074, when he was commissioned with seven other astronomers to reform the Calendar for Melik Shah; and 1112, when Nizami-i-'Aruzi met him in Balkh. Supposing Hasan-i-Sabbah to have been born in 1050, it is scarcely likely that Omar was of the same age as he ; for it is improbable that Omar should have been the first astronomer of his day when but twenty-four years old, which on this supposition would have been his age in 1074. I am therefore inclined to place Omar's birth some ten years earlier than Hasan's. Let us conjecture that he was born in 1040 : this would"], [89, "OF OMAR KHAYYAM 71 make him eighty-three in 1123, the date usually assigned for his death, and seveny-two when Nizami-i-'Aruzi last met him. The date of Omar's death does not rest on very firm authority, and I am even disposed to doubt the story of his intimacy with Sultan Sanjar. This story is only to be found in the works of later biographers, who may quite pos sibly have confused Sultan Sanjar with Shams ul-Mulk the Khakan of Bokhara (see p. 49). Sultan Sanjar came to the throne of the Great Seljuks in 1117; but as we have seen, he had for twenty years been Governor of Khorasan, and in that capacity he may have had intercourse with Omar ; but we know for a fact that in his youth at any rate he had a dislike for Omar (see p. 49). It may therefore even be doubted whether Omar lived to see the accession of Sanjar to the throne. All we know is that in 1112 he was alive, and that in 1135, when Nizam-i-'Aruzi visited his tomb, he had been dead some years. The Teheran edition of the Ruba'iyat mentions an astrological prediction made by Omar ' in the winter of a. h. 508' (a.d. 1114-1115), so that we"], [90, "THE LIFE AND TIMES 72 must place his death between 1115 and 1135. It will be seen, therefore, that the date hitherto generally accepted, 1123, has everything in its favour and nothing against it. Let us now sum up in brief all we positively know of Omar Khayyam. He was born in the eleventh century in Nishapur. His father, Ibrahim, was possibly a tent-maker by trade, but it is unlikely that Omar ever plied this trade himself.1 He received a thorough education in his native town, master ing the Koran, the Traditions, Classical Arabic, and the Sciences.2 He was especially addicted to astronomy and philosophy ; he also made a 1 From the Arabic form of the name el-Khayyami, it would appear that Khayyam is to be regarded rather as a family name than as indication that Omar's father was a tent-maker. El-Khayyam might mean the tent-maker, but not so el- Khayyami. 2 The curriculum of a scholar in the eleventh century is thus summed up in the Chahar Makala (p. 24 of Mr. Browne's translation) : \u2014 the Koran ; the Hadis or Traditions ; Memoirs of the Companions ; the Proverbial Sayings of the Arabs and the Wise Words of the Persians ; correspondence of Sahib Isma'il ibn 'Abbad ; the Kabus Nama ; the Arabic Classics in Prose and Verse ; and finally, the Persian poets such as Rudagi, Firdawsi, and 'Unsuri.

By profession, at any rate, he was an astronomer, and was one of the eight men who were appointed by Melik Shah to reform the Calendar, and who instituted the famous Jalali Era. Though he was, according to his contempo raries, disinclined to write, he produced books and pamphlets on the most various subjects, as well as many poems both in Arabic and Persian.

How ever, there can be no doubt that Omar did write quatrains, as well as other poems both in Arabic and Persian, that he won a certain fame as an epigrammatic poet in his own day, and that a great number of the quatrains (I suspect the best among them) attributed to him are actually from his pen.1 In conclusion to this Introduction I would say one word about the Ruba'i form of verse.

But, as Mr. Heron-Allen again points out, Fitz- Gerald's translation is not merely a paraphrase of Omar ; it represents the whole course of his Persian studies, and we shall see later how much he was influenced also by Hafiz and by 'Attar. He did not profess to give a literal translation of Omar, but only to represent the philosopher poet's general thought and position on the burning subjects which he touched upon in his Ruba'iyat. 'It amuses me,' he wrote, 'to take what liberties I like with these Persians . . . who really do want a little art to shape them ' ; and"], [102, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 84 again in another letter to Professor Cowell, 'I suppose very few people have ever taken such pains in translation as I have : though certainly not to be literal.' Yet much of FitzGerald's work is remarkably close to the original, although it is, as he himself acknowledges, 'but a very one - sided version.' Mr. Heron- Allen points out that forty-nine of his quatrains are faithful and beautiful paraphrases of single quatrains to be found in the Ouseley or the Calcutta manuscripts, or in both ; and that forty-four may be termed composite quatrains, being trace- able to more than one of the original Ruba'iyat. But, as I shall try to show, some of these, though in the first instance inspired by Omar, have been by his paraphraser so turned about to fit his own line of speculative thought that they do not always give us a correct impression of the original. Those who find in FitzGerald's volume something more than a reflection of the philo sophy of Lucretius, and are apt to ascribe this to Omar, should recollect that the works of the Roman poet were the almost invariable com panion of FitzGerald in his yachting cruises,"], [103, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 85 and probably influenced him as much as any other of the many philosophical treatises which he loved. A modern element is also introduced into the Ruba'iyat which is no less interesting than the medi\u00e6val point of view, but which should be distinguished from it by the student who cares to know how much of FitzGerald's volume is his own, and how much is Omar's. And this is perhaps the more difficult, since the paraphrase is so perfect a poetical expres sion that the reader fails to detect in it that trail of the serpent which usually accompanies translations. The paraphrase was finished in 1857, and the story of its failure is written among the literary annals of our time. The manuscript was sent to Parker, who kept it for two years, not caring apparently either to use it or to give it up to the author. In March 1859 FitzGerald printed two hundred and fifty copies of the little volume in modest pamphlet form on his own responsibility, and keeping a few for himself left the remainder with Quaritch to sell on his behalf. The book was a complete failure. The published price was"], [104, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 86 five shillings, at which it found no buyers. It was reduced at quick intervals from shillings to pence, and, failing to attract the public at any price, it came down at last to the ignominy of the 'penny box.' At a penny a copy it could not be difficult to get rid of any book, however worthless. But at this modest price it began to assert itself to a few great minds. Dante Gabriel Rossetti had found the little pamphlet, and admonished his pupils to buy this strange ano nymous poem. Richard Burton and Algernon Swinburne got copies, and blazed abroad the author's genius. Presently a little vogue began. These few men spread the report of the poem, and in 1868 a second edition was called for, to be followed' at narrowing intervals by many more editions, so that for the last decade hardly a year has gone by without some publication in England of FitzGerald's work, with still wider recognition in the United States. It is a house hold word among literary persons, as well as among many who are not literary, and has, as Mr. M'Carthy, in the interesting preface to one"], [105, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 87 of his own translations, has pointed out, largely influenced the poetical form of our generation. FitzGerald's version no less than Omar's is the work of a true poet \u2014 ' A planet equal to the Sun That cast it ' \u2014 as Tennyson said of it. He has given us a re presentation of the Oriental in language which no lover of either would endure to see altered for the sake of any mere verbal accuracy. In force, in structure, and in diction it is very nearly flawless ; and, as an American critic very aptly has told us, FitzGerald's version is in all respects the re-delivery of a poetic inspiration. But in one matter more important than any mere occasional want of adherence to the original thought of Omar, FitzGerald has changed the nature of the work in a manner calculated to mislead the unwary reader. Instead of a dis continuous string of gnomic quatrains, such as Omar left, FitzGerald seems to give us an almost consecutive life-story. He has himself confessed that his poem was 'a mashing together of the original ' ; that as he had strung the verses they"], [106, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 88 lacked simplicity, owing to his ingenious tessela tion of his material into a sort of Epicurean eclogue in a Persian garden. It is essentially necessary to bear this in mind -when reading the poem. After FitzGerald had published his version of Omar he appears to have given up his Persian studies once and for ever. He had certainly contemplated more such work, but probably the pangs of publication had already been sufficient for one of his peaceable and modest nature, and, \u2014 as Carlyle puts it \u2014 of his innocent far niente life. He went back to his old loves : his great English classics, with those of Greece and Spain and Rome. He was not in any event likely to attempt much more in the way of publication, for Mr. F. H. Groome has told us that it was inordinately difficult to persuade him to do any- thing. First he would be delighted with an idea, then raise a hundred objections ; then again he would, and then he wouldn't. He had no incentive from poverty, for his income was more than sufficient for his simple wants. So little did he care for money that if banknotes came"], [107, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 89 while he was reading he would use them as book markers and forget all about them. The popular vogue of his work did not develop itself until after his death, but he would have been the last person to regret that deprivation of the world's adulation which he was not destined to know. Wrhat he might indeed have lamented was the fact that he was never able to read the lines in which Tennyson in 1883 dedicated his volume, Tiresias, to his friend, ' old Fitz.' It was published a week after his death, which took place on the 14th of June in that year. Mr. Le Gallienne humorously remarks in the preface to his rendering of Omar that it is the growing fashion to forget that there was ever any Omar at all ; and Mr. Arthur Platt actually goes so far as to hint that the Persian allusions in the paraphrase are a nuisance, the poem being an English poem by an English poet. But the two are so closely united that their union must be an eternal one. ' East is East and West is West,' but at times great souls greet each other across the gulf, and notably FitzGerald and Omar have clone this ; the lover of the ' fitful charm of"], [108, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 90 Omar' will be the lover of FitzGerald's noble paraphrase. The Persian is a closed book to most English readers, but in Mr. Heron-Allen's two volumes of prose translations the student of FitzGerald may find companions to his modest volume which on intimate acquaintance become indispensable. On the 7th of October, 1893, ten persons charged themselves with an errand inspired by affection and admiration both of Omar and of Edward FitzGerald. A pilgrim to Nishapur had brought back from thence some hips from a rose bush growing over Omar's tomb. These seeds had been intrusted to careful hands at Kew, and from them had been bred two rose-trees destined to grow beside FitzGerald's grave in the churchyard at Boulge. They were planted with reverence at the head of the grave, close to the granite slab which records his birth and death, together with a text chosen by himself. He had groped in darkness, as Omar had done before him, ever seeking the faintest gleam of light to illumine his road ; and, like the great Oriental, he could look up through all the mist"], [109, "EDWARD FITZGERALD 91 which the creeds and philosophies of man's formulating had accumulated around him, and could say, at least, with confidence and faith, ( It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.'"], [110, ""], [111, "THE RUBA'IYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM"], [112, ""], [113, "'_\u00bb THE RUBA'IYAT i Wake ! for the Sun, who scatter'd into flight The Stars before him from the Field of Night, Drives Night along with them from Heav'n and strikes The Sultan's Turret with a Shaft of Light. n Before the phantom of False morning died, Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried, ' When all the Temple is prepared within, Why nods the drowsy Worshipper outside ?

With some it is the ethical side of their writings which we chiefly know, with others it is the mystical ; but in either case the stanzas are strung to gether with a want of consecutiveness which is extremely embarrassing to the student. No sequence of thought is possible, the form of the ruba'i forbidding anything more continuous than short gnomic utterances contained within a given compass. Even if the work is a long one its poems are quite unconnected in argu ment ; for the quatrain is necessarily complete in itself; three lines introduce the subject, and the fourth ' drives the nail through the heart.'"], [142, "COMMENTARY 124 But this is not the whole of the difficulty which we find in attempting to pursue the thought of a Persian poet. He writes his sententious verses in a certain order, in which, however, his readers are not permitted to find them. The copying scribe arranges them after the diwan or alphabetical fashion \u2014 a method hallowed by long custom. He searches for the rhyme-word in each stanza, and arranges the stanza in accord ance with it : all those whose rhyme-word ends in a are classed together, then those which end in b, and so on to the last letter of the alphabet. So that of all the quatrains written by Omar Khayyam, or attributed to him, no one knows in what order they should be presented ; and the only possible clue to the evolution of his religious and philosophical thought is thus denied his readers. FitzGerald, to be sure, arranged a number of stanzas with a certain sequence of ideas, but this selection is illusory and mis leading, though interesting as an attempt to read unity of design in a collection of isolated epigrams. A study of the metre of the ruba'i well repays the time spent on it, for its intricacy and variability make it peculiarly interesting to the student of verse. A form of stanza which"], [143, "COMMENTARY 125 is used for such diverse purposes as is the ruba'i, and adapts itself to all, must of necessity be more elastic than the ordinary quatrain of our Western poetry. An abstract of Mr. John Payne's description will explain its conventional form. The ruba'i is written in various metres, and the third line is often in a different metre from the others. But the special peculiarity is the intricacy of the rhyme scheme, especially of the ' throw-back,' as it may be called, which charac terises the majority of the quatrains. This con sists of what is technically called the redif or 'rere-word,' i.e. of an invariable ending of from one to seven syllables, not in general of the nature of a burden or refrain independent of the rest of the line, but forming the final and inseparable part of the three rhyming lines (as also of the fourth when rhymed), and following immediately upon the rhyme-word, which it thus throws back towards, and in some cases even beyond, the middle of the line. Mr. Payne goes on to give examples, and as the throw-back is difficult to understand without such guides to help the ear and eye in its descrip tion, I will illustrate his meaning from his render ing of one or two of Omar's quatrains. In the first stanza the rhyme-words are, bare, tear, and"], [144, "COMMENTARY 126 where, and the rere-word is formed of three syllables \u2014 three words in fact \u2014 thou shalt go. ' Bethink thee that soulless and bare thou shalt go ; The veil of God's mysteries to TEAR thou shalt go : Drink wine, for thou knowest not whence thou hast come ; Live blithe, for thou knowest not WHERE thou shalt go.' The rhyme-word here is at some distance from the end of the line. Sometimes, but rarely, it will appear quite near the beginning ; again, it will be in what we should consider its proper place, at the end. Occasionally there will be a double internal rhyme in each line, as \u2014 ' Of ease and leisure I '11 take my pleasure nor pause to think.' And another curious form, which Mr. Payne calls the Ding-Dong rhyme, is quaint and pleasing; practically it may be classed with the double rhyme just mentioned \u2014 ' Now the mead with the sound of the Thousand-Tales' singing is ringing, Take the wine the fair, tipsily to and fro swinging, is bringing : Up, the rosebud of gladness has blossomed ! Awhile in the garden Make merry, for life whilst to sorrow thou 'rt clinging is winging.' Other forms of rhyme there are, for the poet appears free to do much as he chooses within"], [145, "COMMENTARY 127 the limits of his stanza. And the metre is as variable. Sometimes all four lines are in the same metre, and, again, the third differs from the other three ; just as in some quatrains all the lines are rhymed, and in others the third is left unrhymed. There are in all twenty-four different metres in Omar's Ruba'iyat. Over 5000 quatrains have been variously attri buted to Omar, and appear in one or other of the many manuscripts which represent him at this day. But not more than two or three hundred are thought to be genuine. At different times the transcribers are believed to have included with the originals various other quatrains inscribed by the faithful on the margins of manuscripts, or added to them by the scoffer. And no man knows for certain which of these are genuine and which are not. They can only be judged by the internal evidence of their simplicity, their epigrammatic finish, and their literary form, together with the fact of their general inclusion in the best texts. The oldest known manuscript is that in the Ouseley collection of the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It is dated at Shiraz, a. h. 865 (a.d. 1460), nearly 350 years after the poet's death, and contains 158 quatrains. This was the principal source of FitzGerald's inspiration ;"], [146, "COMMENTARY 128 and it is noticeable, as Mr. Heron-Allen has pointed out, that our translator in making his paraphrase was careful to use in the main only those originals which appear in at least two mss., and one of these the oldest, and presumably the most genuine and trustworthy, in existence. Nothing is more difficult than so to balance the sparse evidence at our disposal as to form a just idea of the life and creed of Omar Khayyam. Though he never tired of ridiculing Sufism, he has been claimed as a Sufi by many generations of Persians, who read in his verses an esoteric mysticism which to the ordinary observer does not appear to exist in them. There can be little doubt that he had been initiated into all the teaching of that remarkable system, for even FitzGerald, while practically rejecting the Sufism of Omar, admits some traditional assumption in favour of this view, and there is no denying that mysticism may be found in a few of his verses. But it does not follow that Omar was able to hold to Sufism as a dominant influence in his religious life ; on the contrary, many of his quat rains jeer at the professors of this faith, which he has evidently tried and rejected. To take, for instance, two Sufi doctrines, those of asceti cism and pantheism, we find that although"], [147, "COMMENTARY 129 many of Omar's moods indicate an inclination to pantheism, there are times at which he is dis tinctly opposed to this system of faith. Again, though he goes so far towards asceticism as to desire but little in the way of luxuries or even of common necessaries, still there are certain human joys and indulgences of which he will not deprive himself at the bidding of any one. It is easy enough to read Omar, by the light of latter-day Sufism, as himself a Sufi who uses the language of pleasure as an allegorical veil for devotion. Nicolas in his French translation, for instance, makes copious notes to this effect, in serting the words ' Dieu ' and ' La Divinite ' where Omar seems to speak only of wine ; and in many other details he seeks to prove the poet a mystical devotee using symbolism as an aid to devotion. But Omar was no real Sufi ; it might have been happier for him if he had been. Pro fessor Cowell suggests that the mystical devotion of Persia's better spirits was, at any rate, a grop ing after the Divine, and that in them were depths which Omar's science failed to sound. Yet his life appears to have been a continuous struggle for the light which he was never able to behold, and his verses are like those of Job \u2014 a pathetic cry out of the night. 1"], [148, "COMMENTARY 130 But while Sufis claim him as one of their most devoted children, orthodox Mohammedans have rejected him as an atheist, an accusation which is less tenable than any others which have been flung at him. He never denies God, though he criti- cises, questions, condemns Him. He calls himself in one of his quatrains ' a slave in revolt,' and this phrase admirably describes his position in the matter. He is undoubtedly rebellious, but he does not therefore cease to be a slave. He sees in his Master various attributes and methods of dealing which he cannot approve, and he does not hesitate to tell his mind concerning them. He is undeniably a sceptic, but his scepticism may be said to be within the confines of faith, and has in it an infinite yearning for truth, as well as for the conviction which judgment forces him to hold in suspense. The scientific spirit is a spirit of reverence, and none the less because it seeks to trace things back to law. Omar's scientific mind has established so firmly the ne cessity and the immutability of law, that he claims to judge everything by its canons, and even attempts to explain the supernatural by its aid ; yet to him religion is as momentous a fact as science, both being methods of the Almighty. Even when he seems nearest to materialism \u2014"], [149, "COMMENTARY 131 he is never really near \u2014 the great mystery which lies beyond the region of phenomena is fullv recognised by him, and he makes no effort to deny the existence of the supernatural showing through nature as its heavenward side. He is rather to be regarded as a critic of effete systems than a denier of the possibility of objective knowledge. He realises, as Kaut says, that scepticism in itself is not a permanent resting place for human reason. He is honestly trying to come to some conclusion concerning the mysteries of creation and destiny, dealing very directly with these subjects of vital import to thinking persons of every age ; and it is not for want of the will that he finds himself unable. It has been shown that the same point of view is observable in Tennyson's Two I oices, and also in In Memoriam ; and that our own poet, being unable to find a logical solution of his difficulties, was obliged to fall back on a moral conviction of God and of His love, and to comfort himself with that, as many another has done before and since. This moral solution, for instance, was the only one which Goethe had to offer. Omar is a doubter, but even as a doubter he is incon sistent, many of his ruba'iyat overflowing with confidence in God and love towards Him. He"], [150, "COMMENTARY 132 is a man of many moods, and unluckily all of them appear to be recorded. If he had been of our day his earlier writings would have been withdrawn from circulation, and we should not have been forced to puzzle ourselves over his contradictory utterances. He rejoices in anti theses of doubt and faith : now he rebels, and again he finds implicit trust. He questions, mocks, abuses ; and again we find him low at the footstool of the God whom throughout all his humours he never rejects. He gives himself up to indulgence, and once more he is overcome with aspirations towards all that is high and holy. It is doubt which intervenes between himself and God, but he has no mean self-satis faction in his want of faith. The spirit is willing enough. The record of a human soul is shown us in these verses ; its doubts and disenchantment are those of eveiy age and of every faith. The same soul troubles which beset Omar in his far-away time are the very ones which assailed Koheleth at a remoter past, the same which beset the thinking mind in our busy days, and render it sad and solitary, as Omar's was, in the midst of a noisy world. But Omar has the rare gift of honesty. The thing which is most abhorrent to him is"], [151, "COMMENTARY 133 to profess a virtue which he does not possess. He is independent in thought to a remarkable degree for an Oriental, and what he thinks he seldom hesitates to express, at the risk of loss of character and even of life. There are other charges against him which are equally baseless with that of atheism. He has been called, with some appearance of justifi cation, an Epicurean ; but only in its lighter meaning can the term be applied to him, for he was certainly no follower of the philosophy of Epicurus. He has been taunted with gross materialism ; but at the bottom of his heart, even when he appears inclined to give up God, his whole tendency is towards Him. It is impossible to label Omar. He is an eclectic philosopher and a nonconformist believer by turns, the latter phase being the dominant one. The mischief of it all is that none of our speculations on the subject can be substantiated by proof, so far as present evidence goes. If we were considering a writer of our own time and country, we should accept his latest utterances and judge him by them; but this is impossible in the case of a Persian poet, as I have already pointed out. We can only do our best to harmo nise his disjointed tetrastichs by an approximate"], [152, "COMMENTARY 134 understanding of those influences which may be supposed to have swayed him. In the case of Omar the difficulty lies in the number of the schools of thought to which at various times he seems to have given a measure of adherence. From each he has taken something, but to none is he willing to subscribe with a whole heart. ' Go to ; I will make a religion,' he seems often to say, in the words of a prophet of our own times, but he never succeeds in anything more satisfactory than rejecting one. i Wake ! for the Sun, who scatter'd into flight The Stars before him from the Field of Night, Drives Night along with them from Heav'n, and strikes The Sultan's Turret with a Shaft of Light. The earliest of the quatrains, as arranged by FitzGerald, deal with the lighter themes on which Omar is apt to touch. He begins with nature and love and human joys, and tells his mind concerning their influence upon him. The gradual development of the opening stanza be tween the first and the fourth editions is not the least interesting feature of FitzGerald's para phrase of the Ruba'iyat. Mr. Aldis Wright, in an editorial note to the edition of 1890, tells us that"], [153, "COMMENTARY 135 this stanza is FitzGerald's own, and not Omar's, but the statement has been partly disproved by later examination. We may plainly see that FitzGerald has distinct authority for the first portion of the quatrain as it appeared in his earliest edition, although the polishing which extended over years has essentially altered it. As it appeared in 1859 it reads thus \u2014 Awake ! for Morning in the Bowl of Night Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight : And Lo ! the Hunter of the East has caught The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light. A stone flung into a cup was, amongst nomadic desert tribes, the signal for striking camp, and in these words is suggested the passing of night and the coming of morning. FitzGerald came upon the same image in Jami's Salaman and Absal, which poem, as well as Omar's Ruba'iyat, he paraphrased ; and he makes an equally felicitous use of it there in a different connection when he speaks of \u2014 ' Drinking that cup of Happiness and Tears In which Farewell has never yet been flung.' The happy parallel which follows, describing the first rays of dawn as falling like a noose of light on the palace towers, completes the stanza as Omar left it."], [154, "COMMENTARY 136 FitzGerald was not satisfied with leaving his work in the form in which it first suggested itself to him, and in the evolution of this quatrain we get finally a stanza which owes but little to Omar. The vivid Eastern imagery is lost, and in its stead we have verses which flow more easily from the tongue while losing some of their local colour. 11 Before the phantom of False morning died, Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried, ' When all the Temple is prepared within, Why nods the drowsy Worshipper outside ? ' Before the dawn comes the false dawn \u2014 'morning's left hand' \u2014 a transient light on the horizon which Persians call the ' blue dawn,' or ' morning grey ' ; it appears an hour before day- break, and is a well-known phenomenon in the East. At times of fasting, abstinence lasts from the earliest moment when a white thread can be distinguished from a black one to the corre- sponding moment at night ; and the pre-dawn hour is seized by the Musulman as an opportunity for a solid meal to fortify him against the fatigues of the coming day. But apart from this practice, which is one of common-sense, it was not unusual, Mr. Payne tells us, for wine-drinkers after a night"], [155, "COMMENTARY 137 of revelry to salute the first rays of dawn with a cry known as the Wail of the Morning, which was, in effect, a cry for more wine. As the fore dawn prayer to the devout, so was the fore-dawn glass to the toper ; and the Saki, or cupbearer, would be prepared to minister to the needs of the drinker even at that early hour. Hafiz, for instance, says \u2014 'The morning draught, my friend, the morning draught ! It is strange that at such a season They shut up the wine tavern ! Oh, hasten ! ' The image of Temple and WTorshipper, how ever, does not in this instance come from Omar, and again the evolution of the stanza leads to a divergence from the original which is even more marked than the variation in stanza 1. Omar cries that he may fill up his measure of wine before Fate fills his measure of life. He calls to the Saki to replenish his cup, while Fitz- Gerald's Saki, on the other hand, cries to the drinker to bring his cup to be filled. The quatrain in the first edition of the paraphrase is nearly as far from the original as in the last \u2014 Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry, ' Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry.'"], [156, "138 COMMENTARY Many of Omar's tetrastichs are addressed to the Saki, who was generally a comely youth and nimble. m And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before The Tavern shouted \u2014 ' Open then the Door ! You know how little while we have to stay, And, once departed, may return no more.' But the appeal to the cupbearer is only held over to the third stanza. Then the loiterer outside the tavern becoming impatient cries for his morning draught. The quatrain as rendered by FitzGerald represents no one stanza, but is composed from several of the original, and in it the first serious note is sounded. The Saki is reminded of the brevity of life ; wine must be drunk to gratify the heart, for those who are asleep can find no pleasure, and those who have departed will never return.

'The one absolutely impossible conception of God,' says the author of Lux Mundi, ' is that which represents Him as an occasional visitor ' ; and Omar is fully persuaded, when he goes out into the desert, of the in dwelling nearness of God. He perceives Him immanent in nature, 'within all things and without all things, above all things and beneath all things,' 1 and it is with this indwelling Spirit that he seeks in some of his quatrains to find proofs of a personal communication through the quickening of his own spiritual life. The Sufis see a divine mystery in every phase of earthly beauty, and Omar is one with them in this conviction when he goes out to commune with nature. The New Year's Day of the Persians corre sponds with the period of the vernal equinox, and is commemorated by a festival said to have been instituted by Jamshid, the semi-mythical monarch whose name is so often met with in Persian literature. Mr. Binning, in his Two Years' Travel in Persia, of which book FitzGerald 1 St. Gregory the Great."], [159, "COMMENTARY 141 made copious use, tells us that the approach of spring is very rapid in that country. Before the snow is well off the ground the trees burst into blossom and the flowers start forth from the soil. Green plants spring up from the plain, and the notes of the blackbird and the woodpecker are heard. It is at this time of release from winter's thrall \u2014 the season when 'the warmth of the land is not hot, and the coolth of it is not cold ' 1 \u2014 that, as Omar says, happiness seems to come again to the world, and the living heart (that is, the heart initiated in spiritual things) yearns for the desert \u2014 ' Now that there is a possibility of happiness for the world, Every living heart has yearnings towards the desert, Upon every bough is the appearance of Moses' hand, In every breeze is the exhalation of Jesus' breath.''2 Many of the legends found in Persian poetry come from Jewish history and the traditions of the Pentateuch. In this stanza we have a reference to the Hebrew scriptures \u2014 'And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom ; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.' 3 But the Mohammedans hold that the hand 1 Firdawsi. 3 Exodus iv. 6. 2 Mr. Heron-Allen's translation."], [160, "COMMENTARY 142 of Moses, when he drew it forth at the bidding of God from his garment, was not leprous, but bright and shining as if by a miraculous trans formation. As the Koran has it \u2014 ' And God said unto him, O Moses, draw near and fear not, for thou art safe. Put thy hand into thy bosom, and it shall come forth white, without any hurt.' Al Baydawi, the learned commentator, remarks that Moses was a very swarthy man, and that his hand became bright like the sun. Here the simile is fancifully used to describe the sudden breaking out of spring blossoms upon the cercis trees in the plains of Khorasan, and there follows a further allusion to the scripture of the Christian. In Persian literature Christ is commonly alluded to as a life-giver ; he is called by the Moslems the Breath of God, for they consider that from His breath came the healing power which is recorded of Him. His miracles are authorita tively admitted, and He is placed next below Mohammed by the orthodox. But the Sufis place Him on an equality with God, considering Him as a Sufi who has attained the Supreme Beatitude.

The claims of mortal existence do not preclude the exercise of the spiritual imagination ; and Omar, whose love and knowledge of life may have formed a broad foundation for his upgrowth to higher things, betrays to us here and elsewhere his yearnings after the divine. v Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose, And Jamsh^d's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows ; But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine, And many a Garden by the Water blows. A very composite quatrain follows which cannot be successfully traced in its entirety to Omar, although it breathes the true spirit of his poetry, and, in fact, of all Persian poetry. The evanescence of things material is the text- \u2014 a text which reappears continually. Although no reference to the Garden of Iram can be found in any quatrains attributed to Omar, FitzGerald had doubtless met with the subject in the works of one of the many Eastern poets who have dealt with it. It is a matter of common belief that"], [162, "COMMENTARY 144 this garden, planted by King Shaddad, is sunk deep in the sands of Arabia. It was an en chanted garden, a meet subject for the poet if he had chosen to use it, as he certainly did use the similar theme of the seven-ringed magic cup of Jamshid. This Jamshid was the fifth king of the Pishdadian dynasty \u2014 a semi-mythical monarch. His name was Jam or Jem, which means king, and the suffix ' shid ' signifies ' sun ' ; he was emphatically the ' Roi Soleil ' of Iranian romance, and many a story of prowess and love in Persian belles lettres is derived from his mythical deeds. The seven-ringed metal cup which he possessed was invented by Kay Khosru, who is identified with Cyrus, the great king of the Medes and Persians, and in this cup the whole world was reflected, so that its owner was able by its aid to tell the past, present, and future. It was engraved with the signs of the zodiac and other cabalistic marks to help in divination, and fable tells us that it fell afterwards into the possession of Alexander the Great. Nicolas claims for the Patriarch Joseph the possession of a similar divining-cup, referring to the Book of Genesis, which describes the silver cup which Joseph caused to be hidden in Benjamin's sack \u2014"], [163, "COMMENTARY 145 ' Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth ?

Earthly power and grandeur are but transitory things, and the poet clings to the pleasures \u2014 though equally fleeting \u2014 of the passing moment, seeing in their very evanescence a reason for enjoyment. The grape and the garden near the desert are all he can wrest from Fate, but these he will enjoy while they remain to him.

The reference, however, is in perfect harmony with the subject, for the sweet voice of David is con tinually mentioned in Iranian literature. He is for Mohammedans the type of the musician, and Tabari, a ninth-century chronicler, says of him : \u2014 ' God sent David the Psalms, and gave him a goodly voice, so that he sang them to such fine airs and on such fair wise that none ever heard the like ; and when he went about to chant the praises of the Most High, the birds of Heaven came, and settling about his head hearkened unto him.' But FitzGerald in his turning of the Ruba'iyat into an eclogue uses the reference to David to carry on the imagery he is conjuring up. David's lips are lockt, but in his place there is the nightingale \u2014 the ' Thousand-Tales.' Mr. Binning says that the Persian nightingale comes with the roses in April, and departs with them at the end of the summer. His voice is one of the joys of life, and he does not pass away with the great ones of the earth, but is with us every spring to tell of love and happiness.

The Pahlavi \u2014 the pre-Mohammedan language of Persia \u2014 has given place to another, but the Nightingale's Pahlavi remains ever the same, and his love for the Rose is eternal and unchangeable. It is only thus remotely that the favourite Eastern subject of the loves of the nightingale and the rose is introduced into the poem. The bird cries ever to his beloved that she must drink wine to give colour to her yellow cheek, yellow and sallow being words practically interchangeable in Persian, and indicative of sickness or misery. 'The Rose speaks all languages,' says Emerson. To Omar as well as to ourselves of these latter days she tells of love, and joy, and hope return ing with vernal sunshine, and perhaps also of inevitable death.

Nicolas and Bodenstedt in place of the image of the Bird of Time, which is not strictly Omarian, describe the nightingale as inciting to the carpe diem practice. And here again we have the feeling which is so strong in the Eastern poet of the ruthlessness of Destiny; the hollowness of worldly things leading always to the theory of present enjoyment as a guide to life.

But for Balkh of the original he substituted the rhyme-word Babylon, as a more euphonious read ing, and, for Baghdad, Nishapur. The quatrain is a very gem of melody, and it is also very close to the original in its rendering. 'When the Cup is full,' says Omar, ' what matter whether it be sweet or bitter ? When the soul escapes, what matter whether it be at Baghdad or at Balkh ?

The tulip-cheeked and"], [171, "COMMENTARY 153 the narcissus-eyed are fit company for the poet in the spring of the year, and perhaps also in the spring of life. He is neither the master nor the slave of any man ; his lot is tranquil, and he is content in it, for his hedonism is of the sort that points to the control of enjoyment in the midst of enjoyment. He calls for the lute as well as for the diwan of verses, the goblet and the loaf, and thus gives the suggestion adopted by the paraphraser in the third line \u2014 And Thou Beside me singing in the Wilderness \u2014 XIII Some for the Glories of This World ; and some Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come ; Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go, Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum ! Man's foe is Time, and the spoils to be taken from him are the pleasures he carries, for every instant that he gets nearer to Eternity the risk is the greater of losing them altogether. This is the task that Omar sets himself \u2014 the wrest ing from the enemy of mortal joys, oblivious of an only possible future with its nebulous pro mises. As the pomp of this world is vain, so is"], [172, "COMMENTARY 154 the elusive future of the Prophet's Paradise, which lies far away in a shadowy region never seen by the eye of man, if, indeed, any such Paradise there be. The Prophet has promised to those who come unto it rivers of wine, delight to the drinkers, black-eyed houris, and other joys. But why wait, says Omar, for that remote and uncertain day of enjoyment ? There is wine here, and there are tulip-cheeked ones, and these make a very Paradise of earth itself. ' Sweet is it to drink red wine in a fair cup. Sweet is it to hear the wedded melodies of lutes and harps. The future may promise many good things, even to a place among those who dwell in palaces. But the drum of the palace is a dim and far-away prospect, and here to-day there are real pleasures about which there can be no mistake. Since mortal life is a present substitute for some larger life, and since this world contains those delights which a better world has only promised, shall not man enjoy on earth the pleasures that are awaiting him in Heaven ? The poet even goes so far as to mock at the Moslem Paradise \u2014 'Thine be the promised Heaven,' he says: 'give me the cash \u2014 the wine-cup, the golden girl and the lute.' And Hafiz has a similar stanza \u2014"], [173, "COMMENTARY 155 ' Though the zealot hopeful be of Houris and of Palaces, My Belov'd my Houri is, the tavern is my Palace high.'1 In something of the same spirit of enjoyment sang the more devout Luther \u2014 ' Who loves not woman, wine, and song, He is a fool his whole life long.'

If conscience and will seem to urge him to action, his keen wit and critical insight come in to prove the uselessness of action. ' We have a little hour,' he says in his hopelessness ; ' let us waste it well !

And Bahrain Gur, the Sasanian king, the greatest hunter that ever"], [177, "COMMENTARY 159 lived, is buried deep in the quicksands of the plains of Veramin, for the grave has caught him. And here comes in the original a play of words that can only inadequately be trans lated. Bahram, who caught the gur \u2014 the wild ass \u2014 is himself caught by the gur \u2014 the grave. Mr. Binning, when he visited the ruins of Persepolis, found several verses of Hafiz and other poets inscribed by passers-by on the walls, and among them the quatrain from Omar which FitzGerald has translated as follows \u2014 ' The Palace that to Heav'n his pillars threw, And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew \u2014 I saw the solitary Ringdove there, And \"Coo, coo, coo,\" she cried, and \"Coo, coo, coo.\" ' Ku is the Persian word for ' Where ? ' and the poet's lament over the transience of things is thus recorded on the very ruins which served him many centuries previous as illustration. In Omar's imagery, as has been well pointed out, it is always the intellectual which prevails. It is not the present ruin and desolation of the palace which was once magnificent that holds the imagination so much as the idea of muta bility, death, and decay of all things earthly."], [178, "COMMENTARY 160 XIX I sometimes think that never blows so red The Rose as where some buried C\u00e6sar bled ;\" That every Hyacinth the Garden wears Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.

Omar in his quatrain speaks of the violet, not of the hyacinth which FitzGerald substitutes for the violet in the third line, and says that every blossom was once a mole on the cheek of a lovely woman. Moles and other ' beauty spots ' are very highly esteemed in the East. But this manner of imagery is not peculiar to Orientals. Shelley says in his Queen Mab \u2014 ' There 's not one atom of yon earth But once was living man : Nor the minutest drop of rain, That hangeth in the thinnest cloud, But flowed in human veins.

He is tinged with the philosophical doctrine of metempsychosis, which is part of the creed of Brahmanism. To tread lightly the soil which once perhaps was a woman tulip-cheeked, is, in his eyes, a desecration ; the contemptuous foot is not to spurn it heedlessly.

The Wheel of Heaven may at any minute number his days among the past and gone Seven Thousand Years which, according to Iranian computation, represented the age of the earth in Omar's time. If we think Omar too prone to find his ideal in the material we must remind ourselves that, as commentators have told us, drinking was not at his time in the East a vulgar and degrading dissipation. M. Darmesteter in Les Origines de la Poesie Persane, has pointed out a distinction between the drink ing songs of Europe and those of the Orient. Our Western lays on this subject are mere chansons d'ivrogne ; but those of Persia are songs of emancipation, and represent the revolt of reason against the irrational law of the Koran, against bigotry and hypocrisy and oppression. With the exception of theology, all the intel lectual life of the Oriental was associated with the wine party. We are told of the entertain ments of Harun ar-Rashid and the Barmecides, and we know that these parties owed most of"], [181, "COMMENTARY 163 their charm to the wit and song and mental intercourse and stimulus to be found there. As Khorasan was the very centre and focus of intel lectual vigour, so were the entertainments at the houses of the great the centre and focus of all the culture of the day. Here music and wisdom and poetry met and were honoured, and wine was something more than a material enjoyment \u2014 it was a necessary accompaniment to the re fined arts. And probably to Omar it was even more again than this, if, as FitzGerald suggests, he praised more than he drank of it. It cer tainly represented to him the joyousness of life \u2014 -that mental refreshment which finds its charm in congenial companionship. Wine is to him not a mere animal dissipation ; it stands for mortal gladness, legitimate pleasure, a desire for which has been implanted by God in the human breast. We do not find him drinking in solitude ; his incitement to indulgence is nearly always of the sort which merely cries ' Pass the bottle ! ' One of his quatrains which seems to indicate this very clearly may be found in the Ouseley ms. \u2014 ' Even though the wine is forbidden, for all that it depends upon who drinks it, And then in what quantity, and also with whom he drinks it ;"], [182, "COMMENTARY 164 These three conditions being as they should be ; say ! Who drinks wine if a wise man does not do so ? ' 1 But behind the joy of living lies the shadow of death. From his dust will the potter make clay for vessels. It is a pathetic reason for the cultivation of forgetfulness, and Omar goes more fully into it in the following stanzas. XXII For some we loved, the loveliest and the best That from his Vintage rolling Time hath prest, Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before, And one by one crept silently to rest. The Wheel of Heaven is seeking his doom, as it has sought and secured the doom of many who were one with him in the fellowship of souls. They have drunk the fatal cup, and 'crept silently to rest.' Fortune gives nothing that it does not as soon take away. It tells its tale to no man, but in silence \u2014 ' The hands That reach through Nature, moulding men,' remove alike the Sultan and his slave, and give their room unto others. 1 Mr. Heron-Allen's translation."], [183, "COMMENTARY 165 XXIII And we, that now make merry in the Room They left, and Summer dresses in new bloom, Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth Descend \u2014 ourselves to make a Couch \u2014 for whom ? And these others in turn must yield their place to succeeding generations, and the grass springing from their clay shall be the playground of later comers. The very thought is horrible to Omar, who, in his gloomier moments, feels no security of a life beyond the grave. The law of corporeal transmigration, as Professor Cowell calls it, is abhorrent to him, and jars on his very soul. If pleasure can help him to forgetfulness, he will seek in it the oblivion which can nowhere else be found, though probably he knows full well that such epicurean consolation will in the end add but a deeper gloom to his present melan choly. XXIV Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend. Before we too into the Dust descend ; Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and \u2014 sans End! The haunting refrain goes on \u2014 ' Let us eat"], [184, "COMMENTARY 166 and drink, for to-morrow we die.' Men who are dead cannot hear or see or feel ; they can claim no friend, no comrade, no mate, and thus destitute they will sleep long beneath the sod. We can perceive in Omar here the point of view observable in the address of the Emperor Hadrian to his departing soul. Earth is Heaven for him, and the future is naught but darkness \u2014 ' Poor little pretty fluttering thing, Must we no longer live together? And dost thou prune thy trembling wing To take thy flight, thou know'st not whither? Thy humorous vein, thy pleasing folly, Lies all neglected, all forgot ; And pensive, wavering, melancholy, Thou dread'st and hop'st thou know'st not what.'1 The two final words, and the gloomiest, of the quatrain appear to be purely FitzGerald. All things whisper in the poet's ear of death and decay ; and since he has no certain home in this world, he counts it folly to neglect the benefits he can still claim of Fortune. ' Man giveth up the ghost, and where is he ? ' cries Job. And Herri ck many centuries later arrives at a like conclusion \u2014 ' Let us now take time and play, Love and live here while we may, 1 Matthew Prior's translation."], [185, "COMMENTARY 167 Drink rich wine and make good cheer, While we have our being here, For, once dead, and laid i' th' grave No return from thence we have.' ] XXV Alike for those who for To-day prepare, And those that after some To-morrow stare, A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries, ' Fools ! your Reward is neither Here nor There.' The first two lines of this stanza contain part of the idea of a previous one carried over ; but there is naught in Omar about the Tower of Darkness, and the Muezzin who cries from his watching-place does not talk of Reward, but of the Road by which a possible Reward may be obtained \u2014 ' Fools ! your road is not here nor there.' And now we come to the first expres sion of Omar's agnosticism as rendered by Fitz- Gerald. The problem of Life is set forth, and Omar's failure to solve it occupies a large number of the succeeding ruba'iyat. The Strait Way of Salvation is the uphill road which he spends his life in searching for, and never with success. Some, he tells us, are busy in the contemplation 1 To Sappho."], [186, "168 COMMENTARY of doctrines and creeds ; some stand bewildered between doubt and belief, and to all the mock ing Muezzin cries \u2014 ' Fools ! the way is not this nor that.' Omar's lifelong study of exact sciences has led him astray. He cares for nothing which he cannot prove. He is before everything a man of facts, though here the facts he craves for are the less obvious ones of the passion and the purpose of man \u2014 the facts of feeling and thought in human nature. The doubts which possess him harass his very soul, and he resents them as though they had been a plague sent to curse him, for the idea that it is a thinking man's duty to grapple with doubt does not seem to occur to him. He wants only to look into the laws Of life and death, and things that seem, And things that be, and analyse Our double nature, and compare All creeds till we have found the one, If one there be.'1 His brooding mind looks out into a space both dark and void, hoping to see forms shape them selves and come to his call, that he may bring his laws of science to bear upon them, and prove them false or real.

There are some reli gious minds which can stare out into the fog and see sights and shapes that are not actually visible ; others there are, equally religious, which can see nothing, because nothing is clearly defined. Of these last is Omar. His pangs of discord with the world are never stilled. He cannot be satisfied except with a truth which he can prove to be a truth. With Pyrrho he cries, ' Who knoweth ? ' but unlike Pyrrho he cannot attain to the mental imperturbability which is the proper accompaniment of scepticism, although the epicurism which he aims at is in tended to be a stage on the road to this result. The philosophy of Koheleth was not very different from this \u2014 ' Who knoweth the spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ? ' Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works ; for that is his portion : for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him ? ' 1 But while Omar tries to find consolation in 1 Eccles. iii. 21-22."], [188, "COMMENTARY 170 material things, he yet longs for a fuller portion than they can bring him. The fact that he has unconquerable yearnings after immortality may be dimly traced in this stanza, unless it is to be read in a narrower meaning as referring to the Sufi Mystic Way, and its illusory ideals. But in either case his intimation that he is looking for a Road shows that he is striving after an ultimate destination. As the human soul with its many moods and speculations and trials is his favourite theme, so his earnest desire seems to be to find assurance that the soul will escape annihilation. Unlike Cleon, who was convinced that Death is indeed the end, and that speculation is there fore useless, Omar feels that life is intolerable if it is to close in nothingness. He can never convince himself of man's spiritual mortality, though he makes many an effort to do so, if only to find certainty of something, however sorry. His mathematical habit of thought for bids his contenting himself with anything short of a demonstrable conclusion. Cleon laments that he shall know all when he can least enjoy \u2014 ' It is so horrible, I dare at times imagine to my need Some future state revealed to us by Zeus, Unlimited in capability For joy, as this is in desire for joy,"], [189, "COMMENTARY 171 \u2014 To seek which the joy-hunger forces us But no ! Zeus has not yet revealed it ; and alas, He must have done so, were it possible.'1 Omar, on the other hand, wants immortality because it alone can justify Allah's otherwise valueless gift of earthly life. Our unattainable ideals appear to him to be implanted meaning lessly in us unless there is a possibility of their ultimate realisation. That they are within us should be a guarantee of this, if God is not wantonly tormenting us. His haunting dread is that death may interrupt the continuity of existence, and he seems to feel the craving of Empedocles for an eventual home for the soul \u2014 ' . . . To the elements it came from Everything will return. . . . But mind, but thought \u2014 Where will they find their parent element ? Who will receive them, who will call them home ? . . .

Perhaps the wise are, after all, only fools thinking themselves wise, like those at whom Job jeered when he cried, ' Ye are the people ; wisdom shall die with you.' Even sages who have claimed to have attained mystical union with God, through prayer and fasting and contem plation \u2014 even those who have professed to rid themselves of individuality, and actually to be God, have passed and are forgotten, or will be forgotten soon \u2014 ' For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been already old forgotten \u2014 for all is vanity, and a striving after wind.' 1 Omar is seeking the assurance that happiness 1 Eccles. ii. 16, 17."], [191, "COMMENTARY 173 in this world, or in another, or in both, will be granted to the wise man, and this assurance he fails to find. His faith ebbs and flows with the fulfilment or the non-fulfilment of his desires.

It is the death of the body that troubles him ; to him at present it is a final physical fact. Long as man has lived upon this earth he has never learned to reconcile himself to normal conditions ; the struggle begins over again in every thinking mind, inciting to revolt, perhaps, or urging to despair. The cry here is for happiness as a state of mind, not of circumstance, for it is the tendency of the Oriental to find his felicity in his mental rather than in his external conditions. The Western man has a different ideal. His outward interests are absorbing ; activity is rampant ; feelings are a trivial con sideration compared with more material things, so that a habit of introspection has but small chance of establishing itself as a factor of his life. With the Oriental, on the other"], [192, "COMMENTARY 174 hand, self-knowledge and self-discipline are the primary elements for the making of happiness. But Omar finds that the good man is as much subject to trouble as the wicked man, and he is uneasy in consequence.

Omar in these stanzas fails to perceive this purpose ; he does not regard mortal life as a progress towards a completer spiritual existence ; he neglects to look beyond the evil to a divine end. He is by force of external influences too strongly impregnated with the doctrine of predestination to allow of his recognising the free agency of man, and with it the fact that evil is an essential accompaniment of man's freedom. Since God gave man the power to shape his own destiny He could not compel him to any rigid course of action, so that evil is the result of human finitude, and not of divine severity. But it is also a part of the material out of which man, with his Free Will, must build a ladder that will reach to God. Later we shall see Omar in a still more strenuous effort to reconcile man's affliction with God's righteousness.

Students would be required to make themselves proficient in Koranic exegesis, as well as in the other branches of learning suited to the education of a gentleman of the period. And it is not likely that Omar in his wide erudition had neglected the study of religions, so that we may not doubt that Vedantism was at least as well known to him as other unorthodox theologies. The use by him of its terminology has, in fact, been much insisted upon by Mr. Payne.

Probably at some time Omar had even been himself a Sufi, for that passage in the Tarikh which relates that he had been used to exhort his disciples to seek the one God by a process of self-purification points to the practice of some mystic ritual. Sufism occupies a remarkable position in the history of mystic modes, for it grafts upon a religion apparently antagonistic to it the pantheistic tenets which are Sufism's principal feature. The faith of Islam is impatient of any speculations about God, for the Moham medan Deity is an absolute Will, who demands unquestioning obedience to the Law as dictated in Heaven to His Prophet. In this Law the first principle is the doctrine of the divine Unity; God is One God, a great personal Being, a House Father ruling his family with watchful jealousy. His worship abounds with dogmas and ritual ; Nature has no place in it, and sym bolism is unrecognised. Upon this unsuitable stock the Persians have grafted an ancient theosophical system better adapted to their spiritual needs than Mohammed's cold and barren letter, while yet maintaining that formal adherence to Islam which was originally imposed and subsequently enforced at the sword's point."], [197, "COMMENTARY 179 The Sufi extension of the main tenet of Moham medanism \u2014 the Unity of God \u2014 may be expressed in the maxim, ' There is no real existence save Allah,' all else being phenomenal and therefore non-existent.

In their view God is immanent in all things, expresses Himself through all things, and is the essence of every human soul. There is not only no God but God, but no being, life, or spirit except the being, life, and spirit of God ; and every man may be God's prophet, and more even than His prophet.' The contention is that God being One, the creation must necessarily be a part of Him, since otherwise it would exist externally to Him, which would be equivalent to regarding the uni verse as a Deity opposed to God.

Although Sufism in its main principles was not strictly speaking exotic, it borrowed some thing from various ancient schools through Neo- Platonism, and, like the Alexandrian philosophy, its mystical doctrine consists of a theoretical part, dealing with the high origin of the human soul, and its falling away from its first estate; and of a practical part, pointing out the way by which it may again attain to the Eternal. For if the Pantheist believes that he is actually God, the Pantheist who is also a mystic recognises that a certain separation has ensued between himself and the Divine, and it is his aim to find again the God from whom he has been alienated. He feels himself capable, even in this life, of being consciously re-united to God, and the one means of communion with Him, and mystical absorption into Him, is by a process of self-purification through abstraction from the world, culminating in pure exaltation. It is probable that Omar in his desperate search after truth had not neglected this method of approaching the Friend, and that it is to this that he refers when he tells us that his soul has soared in mystic flight in search of enlightenment."], [199, "COMMENTARY 181 But failing to find what he has sought, he has come out by the same door where in he went. The thirty-first stanza goes more fully into the matter. XXVIII With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow, And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow ; And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd \u2014 'I came like Water, and like Wind I go.' He has sought the truth from sage to priest, and from tyro to teacher. Like the 'weary King Ecclesiast ' he has given his heart to know wisdom, but the result of his studies is naught, because he cannot solve the 'riddle of the pain ful earth ' which he is continually meditating. His soul's deepest doubts come into this quatrain and those immediately following. The religious revelation which was his main influencing agency \u2014 the Koran as delivered by Mohammed \u2014 was a revelation which contained within itself the very germs of discord. So long as men were con tent to accept its teaching without questioning or discussion, it might prove sufficient for all practical purposes. But as soon as they set themselves to inquire into its meaning and its tendency, its conceptions of God, freewill, predestination, and other problems, it failed to"], [200, "COMMENTARY 182 satisfy or to convince the thinking mind. The fact that while preaching the absolute predestina tion of man's actions, it admits at the same time man'.s responsibility, is sufficient to show the kind of contradiction involved in the teaching of this Scripture of Mohammed. Consequently Omar could find no consolation in orthodoxy. It is likely enough, too, that the priesthood of his time, with its ' furious formalisms ' in combina tion with more than suspected trickery, had something to do with his state of mind. It is improbable at any rate that his questioning spirit could be lulled into acquiescence to the outward show of religion of the orthodox Imam, or the mystical tenets of the Sufis. Being unsatisfied by the philosophies, and unconvinced by the Koranic revelation, which leaves without inter pretation the very meaning of life, he was cut adrift from the faith which was essential to his happiness. There was none other which could inspire him. Christianity, of course, was im possible, and to him would have seemed re actionary ; for how should one cradled in the very heart of the enlightened world turn to a faith professed by peoples who were in bar barity and intellectual darkness, as was the case with the whole of Europe at this time with the"], [201, "COMMENTARY 183 exception of Mohammedan Spain ? So, because he cannot guess the Great Secret, his sincere and earnest soul remains on the darker side of belief, and he is forced to cry out with a bitter lamenta tion that although he has given his heart to know wisdom he can only find that his coming into the world was as purposeless as his going out of it will be. XXIX Into this Universe, and Why not knowing Nor Whence, like Water wiily-nilly flowing ; And out of it, as Wind along the Waste, I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing. Revelry and human joys are powerless to fill the aching void within him, and he is, in conse quence, unhappy and uneasy, being beset by what Renan calls ' la grande curiosite ' without the power to satisfy it. It is the very faith in him which makes him fume at his inability to comprehend the Divine. Of all the worlds he has studied, the most real to him is the world of man's thought and passion and purpose ; and he resents the powerlessness of the human mind when brought face to face with the problems of the Whence, the Why, and the Whither. He can gain nothing from life save amazement at it. He has no security of any purpose in his coming"], [202, "184 COMMENTARY and being and going. Many of his contem- poraries who were vexed by doubts similar to his, might, and indeed did, take final refuge in mysticism ; others, though convinced, as he was, that Islam's creed was not based on the eternal relations of things as settled by the Deity, might be content with hypocritical pretensions to orthodoxy. But Omar's clear and sincere mind cannot sanction either of these courses to him. He will not rest until he has pulled down all the false gods, and established in their place the divine ; and in his determination to root out the false he weakens the soul's very fortress. He would believe if he could, but faith must follow verification. His search for light arises from his conviction that there can be no power of the human intellect which is not given by God, and no wholesome craving which is not implanted by Him. What yearning, therefore, God has bestowed upon him, God can fully satisfy. Amid many false lights there exists always the true light if only it can be discovered. ' The Spirit of Man,' says Solomon, ' is the candle of the Lord.' If man's intellect, which God has given him, can help him no jot to comprehend the divine purpose, which is the only purpose that matters anything, why was it given to man ?"], [203, "COMMENTARY 185 Most of us demand from our hearts the accept ance of a personal First Cause in the universe. Though our speculative reason cannot act beyond the confines of conscious experience, and cannot therefore prove the existence of God, yet our practical reason contains in itself the conscious ness of freedom and of a moral law, which is to us sufficient evidence of the reality of God, not as a mere principle, but as a distinct personality endued with the possession of voluntary power. The world works out moral purposes, and in the working tells those who will listen that it has a Spirit informing and controlling it. In Nature he who looks may find a Personality, the ordered condition of the universe leading to a recognition of its builder and mover ; the soul seeks evidence of a higher soul, and makes of Nature a means of finding Nature's God. Omar finds himself living among many useful and beautiful forms of Nature \u2014 so useful and beautiful that they must be infinitely purpose ful, yet so varied as to be beyond the grasp of man's mind to understand.

The external world is spread out like a book, open to be read by him who cares to peruse it. Omar, in reaction against Sufism, whose tenets are irreconcilable with any belief in purpose, craves to find in it an indwelling reason, a system of purposeful design, and he calls upon God to make explicit this hidden principle. He cannot conceive of man's imperfect powers as germs without possi bility of development, seed without a prospect of future fruit. His discontent has the instinct of humanity behind it. It seems to him that the laws of the Eternal should be framed with a due consideration for man's aims and purposes when these are high and holy. But what does he find in life ? He is hurried into the world, and anon he is hurried out of it, and both with out opportunity of choice, his little life being ruthlessly cut off before its intentions are even half fulfilled. His soul's misery arises through a realisation at one time of his weakness and his power without the ability to find a means of re conciling the honour of God with his possession of two such opposing qualities. This leads him to see fatal imperfection in the laws of the uni verse, not perceiving that a critic, to find such imperfection, should be himself omniscient, for"], [205, "COMMENTARY 187 how can man in his finitude hope to exhaust the significance of the All ?

So, seeing that his coming into the world was not under his own control and that his going out of it will be equally without his consent, and that none of the riddles which he has propounded is likely to be solved, he calls to the Saki for another cup of wine. That Allah who has revealed Himself through his Prophet has, in the course of this revelation, laid his prohibition upon wine, and, since He will not satisfy man's soul with good things, man may take his revenge by indulging it with those that are bad as well as forbidden.

He merely says that it would have been better if he had not come nor lived nor gone, but since he is here he will drink wine. He will drown thought in passing pleasure ; he will, since he is but mortal, join in mortal gladness, and secure the joyous realities of the present moment. He will defy the irresistible. The last thing that it is possible to believe of him is that he is a mere soaker in wine for wine's sake. It is far more likely that besides his defiant delight in breaking the law, he is jesting at those mystics who aim at ecstatic objectivation. A state which they may reach by fasting and contemplation, he can attain to by indulgence in a forbidden pleasure. As the Sufis cultivate a condition of exaltation in order to commune with the Deity, he will aim at the same condition to enable him to forget Him. He will travesty mystic habits to ridicule mysti cism itself. He mocks, and rebels, and despairs, consumed the while with a great longing for the assured presence of the God whom he ignorantly resents, yet cannot wholly reject.

There are many references in Omar to the Seven Gates, or the Seven Heavens. In the Highest Heaven \u2014 the Empyrean \u2014 was the Throne of God, and to that Heaven Omar has raised himself by prayer and fasting. The mystic systems, as has been seen, possess as an essential tenet the belief in the possibility of an earthly union with God through a species of ecstatic transfusion. Vedantism, however, does not regard this union as one between God and man as two separate beings, but rather as a recovery by man of his true nature \u2014 a practical restoration to man of his godhead, which has been in abeyance through cosmical nescience. In his search after knowledge Omar has ' got to God ' in a mystical manner. St. Paul tells us of a similar experience of his own, he being caught up into the third Heaven to see unnamable sights and to hear unspeakable words ; and Plotinus, the Neo-Platonist, who also sought this intercourse with God, relates that he had been"], [208, "COMMENTARY 190 three times able to realise the union with the Divine, ' but Porphyry hitherto not once.' The mystic feels as imperative that tranfusion which to the ordinary intelligence appears im possible, and this aim of the devotee is not un known even in our days, the object being to escape from self as the source of all sin and suffering. Omar's mystical union with God was such that whether in the body or out of the body probably he could not tell, but he knows that he escaped from the bondage of trickery and guile, and flung aside all obstacles. His pheno menal self seemed for the time annihilated in the rapture of the Beatific Union. But the result has not been what he had hoped. He has come back again to earth without learning the Great Secret \u2014 the secret of Life, of Death, and of Eternity. XXXII There was the Door to which I found no Key There was the Veil through whicli I might not see : Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee There was \u2014 and then no more of Thee and Me. Behind the curtain that veils the mysteries there was a talk of Me-and-Thee, but when the curtain fell there was no more of Thee-and-Me."], [209, "COMMENTARY 191 Mr. Heron-Allen, in pointing out the difficulty of this quatrain, quotes two extracts from Ferid ud din 'Attar, which help to bring its Pantheistic meaning within the bounds of comprehension. ' The Creator of the world spake thus to David from behind the Curtain of the Secret : \" Every thing in the world, good or bad, visible or in visible, is mere substitute, unless it be Me, \u2014 Me for whom thou canst find neither substitute nor equal. Since nothing can be substituted for Me, do not cease to abide in Me. I am thy soul ; be not separated from Me. I am necessary, thou art dependent upon Me. . . . Seek not to exist apart from Me.\" ' ' Since long ago, really, I am Thee and Thou art Me \u2014 we two are but one. Art Thou Me, or am I Thee, is there any duality in the matter ? Either I am Thee, and Thou art Me, or Thou, Thou art Thyself. Since Thou art Me and 1 am Thee for ever, our two bodies are one. That is all.' This is an illustration of the Sufi argument of Unity with God, which may have come from the older Vedantic doctrine. It was certainly per fectly familiar to Omar, and probably he had sought to find the truth in both schools of faith. The wisdom of the Upanishads is reflected in many of his quatrains, and a specimen of these precepts of the Indian philosophy may still further help to"], [210, "COMMENTARY 192 elucidate the point of view of Oriental pantheism. The dialogue is between a sage who is giving, and a disciple who is receiving instruction. ' \" Place this salt in water, and then wait on me in the morning.\" ' The son did as he was commanded.

' One came to the Beloved's (God's) door and knocked.

And in the same manner Omar in his mystic flight in search of knowledge has been absorbed in the Deity ; his spirit has been one with the Thee-in-Me beyond the Veil of phenomena ; but the Veil has fallen again, the Thee-in-Me are divided and separate, and the Secret of Destiny has not been revealed. xxxm Earth could not answer; nor the Seas that mourn In flowing Purple, of their Lord forlorn ; Nor rolling Heaven, with all his Signs re- veal'd And hidden by the sleeve of Night and Morn.

In a letter written in 1857 to Professor Cowell, FitzGerald says \u2014 ' While I think of it, why is the Sea (in that apologue of 'Attar . . .) supposed to have lost God ? Did the Persians agree with something I remember in Plato about the Sea, and all in it, being of an inferior nature . . . ? ' 2 He makes use in his paraphrase of 'Attar's story, which runs as follows \u2014 An observer of spiritual things approached the sea And said, \" O Sea, why are you blue ? Why do you wear this robe of mourning ? There is no fire, why do you boil ? \" 1 W. B. Yeats, The Sad Shepherd. 2 Professor Goodwin, of Harvard University, who has tried vainly to discover any such reference in Plato, says he suspects that ' dear old F.G. dreamed the passage.'"], [213, "COMMENTARY 195 The sea made answer to that good-hearted one, \" I weep for my separation from the Friend, Since by reason of my impotence I am not worthy of Him I have made my robe blue on account of my sorrow for Him.\" ' XXXIV Then of the Thee in Me who works behind The Veil, I lifted up my hands to find A Lamp amid the Darkness ; and I heard, As from Without \u2014 'The Me within Thee blind ! ' And once more the ever-searching soul goes back to the Thee-in-Me to ask the solution of the enigma. But here FitzGerald approaches the attitude of negation which is never to be observed in the real Omar. Omar does not in this quatrain deny the indwelling spirit. What he really says is that God is present to all eyes, but all are blind, \u2014 which is a very different thing. XXXV Then to the lip of this poor earthen Urn I lean'd, the Secret of my Life to learn : And Lip to Lip it murmur'd \u2014 ' While you live, Drink ! \u2014 for, once dead, you never shall return.'

So, failing to find any Providence worthy of the name, he again sets about making the best of this world. He resigns the hope that in his ' prisoned soul The flutter of a trembling prayer Can move the Mind that is the Whole.'1 The God to whom he is ever looking is the very God whom he cannot succeed in beholding. But there is something left him still, and that is the joy of living, of which he will make the most. Other earnest anxious minds have endured the same agony in the search for truth, and have come to the same conclusion. The wisdom of Xenophanes showed itself in a sorrowful con viction of the nothingness of things and the futility of endeavour ; and Koheleth, long before, had but anticipated him in lamenting the vanity of all human courses, and the uselessness of the search after wisdom \u2014 ' Then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun : because however much a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it ; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. . . .' 2 1 William Watson, The Unknown God. \" Eccles. viii. 17."], [215, "COMMENTARY 197 'The living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward. . . .' 1 ' I said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth ; therefore enjoy pleasure.' 2 And the poet also abandons the search after the unattainable and gives himself up to pleasure. 'Child of the Four and Five,' he cries, \u2014 of the four elements and the five senses \u2014 'art thou puzzled by the Four and Five ? Then drink !

The world is sentient to the poet of the dust of the departed, and a similar idea occurs in 'Attar's Mantik-ut-Tair, of which the following translation is given by FitzGerald : \u2014 ' One day the Prophet, on a river bank, Dipping his lips into the channel, drank A draught as sweet as honey. Then there came One who an earthen pitcher from the same Drew up, and drank ; and after some short stay Under the shadow, rose and went his way, Leaving his earthen bowl.

It is an image indicative of destiny which is not peculiar to Persian poetry, but occurs in the literature of many languages. In our middle English period we find the expression in the Ayenbite of Inwyt, about a.d. 1340 \u2014 ' Huanne the lhuedi of hap (the Lady of Fortune) hath her huegel y-went (turned) to the manne,' and also in the Hymn lo the Virgin \u2014 ' Now Y am undre Fortune's whele, My frendis forsaken me Euerychoon,' and later, Sir Thomas Browne writes of the ' Wheel of things.'

And before pro ceeding to the consideration of some of the most important of his quatrains, which immedi ately follow, it may be well to examine into the charge of atheism of which some writers have accused the poet. Omar has been compared with the Roman Lucretius, as though the two had held views practically identical. But there is no real parallel between them. Lucretius in his great poem gives his heart and soul to proving the non-existence of things which Omar accepts as a simple matter of course. In his first and second books he seeks to show that there has been no Real Agency in the original making and the subsequent government of the world. Omar never doubts that God made him and holds him in the hollow of His hand. Lucretius applies the principles of the atomic theory to explain the nature of the mind, and to prove that the soul perishes with the body. Omar's yearnings after immortality, and his bitter cry because he cannot prove it, are in themselves a position far removed from negation. The whole of the work of Lucretius is devoted to showing that the world is not itself divine, nor directed by divine agency ; he is an avowed enemy of all"], [222, "COMMENTARY 204 religion. Omar from first to last is a firm be liever in the world's supernatural control, and never for a moment doubts the existence of a Maker and Mover of men. Lucretius, in fine, denies the two bases of religion \u2014 the existence of a God-governor of the world, and the future life of the soul ; and of these two bases Omar holds passionately^ to the one, and clings with a faint hope to the other. In epicurean tendency, indeed, the two are more nearly allied, though not so nearly as might at first appear. Lucretius claims to have attained serene heights which Omar with all his bragging never approaches. There are other features in which resemblance between the two is close, such as their common curiosity about the origin of life, the course of nature, and man's relation to it. The war between science and theology is seen in the speculative philo sophy of both ; both were devoted to the study of natural phenomena, both chose to lead the contemplative life. But these points of contact in the two are as nothing compared with their divergence in belief on the most vital subjects ; for Omar, whatever he may be, is never on the side of negation. He is simply a searcher after Truth, but he starts with a firm belief \u2014 founded"], [223, "COMMENTARY 205 only on innate conviction, but none the less firm though he cannot prove its credibility \u2014 in the reality of God ; and this belief never weakens throughout the whole range of his work.

This teaches that from the one Reality, which is God, rises an illusive pro jection called the universe, and that this world figment is in itself unreal, and nothing more than a reflection of Being upon Not-Being. The Sage knows that the Self alone is the one actual Existence. If Omar, therefore, calls himself naught to-day, it is no more than some of the pietists would teach. He was nothing yesterday, or before birth ; he will be nothing to-morrow, or after death ; and to-day also he is nothing if the mystics around him are right in their re ligion.

It is easy from the point of view of unity to perceive the reason that urged him to omit these quatrains. Their whole tenor is irreconcilable with the scepticism which he chose uniformly to read in Omar, and they are therefore an uncomfortable addition to a poem"], [226, "COMMENTARY 208 of agnosticism. But from every moral point of view it is impossible to ignore them. They are said to be notably authentic, and they exhibit Omar in a light in which hitherto we have not observed him. We have seen that of the two primary points of creed for the believer Omar was firmly persuaded of the first \u2014 the existence of God. These quatrains show him, as nearly as it may be done, as a believer in the second great article of faith \u2014 the immortality of the soul. We will examine carefully what he says, in order that this most important point may be presented with assurance. Professor E. D. Ross has made prose translations of certain originals from which we may conclude that these quatrains were taken by FitzGerald, and we cannot do better for our purpose than study his version. ' Within the circle of the unfathomable spheres, Is a cup from which finally they ask all to drink ; When thy turn comes utter thou no sigh. Drink wine to thy heart's content, for the end is far away \u2014 Drink !

Although Omar cannot hold firmly to mysti cism, the system has worked its inevitable harm by leading him at times to ignore human attributes, and to doubt human personality. But here, shaking off the mystic's tendency to the nebulous, he flings himself upon the necessity for a recognition of personality, which is the ultimate canon of reality. Out of his own consciousness he has anticipated the great conclusion, ' I think ; therefore I am,' for he has recognised in himself being distinct from other beings, separate individuality and freedom of will, as essential and unalterable elements of the phenomenon of personality. This recognition would not be possible for a pure mystic, who, as has been happily said by Professor Seth, would necessarily be deprived of the rights which belong to him as an ethical individuality. Omar has tried mysticism, and has given himself up to the enthralling tenets of Pantheism, that sister mode of mysticism ; but apart from their periods of influence he has O"], [228, "COMMENTARY 210 known himself a personal identity, a permanent being, a self-conscious subject. The soul \u2014 the ' single soul ' \u2014 is the unifying principle, and the mystery of immortality is bound up with its existence. There are times when Omar is able to endure the idea of being ultimately merged in the Whole, but the time, I think, when he wrote the forty-fourth and the forty-fifth quatrains was not one of them. There is no suggestion of the re-absorption of his soul into a Universal Soul from which it is a mere emanation ; the soul here appears to be regarded as something separ ate from the Whole, \u2014 as a Sultan, who deigns to inhabit a mean dwelling for a season, until he can reach a kinglier sphere. But whatever its ultimate destiny, there can be no doubt that a future life is indicated ; the body is not the man : the man \u2014 the tent, as Omar puts it \u2014 will be overthrown, but there is something within the tent which cannot be harmed by death. This is the soul. The three quatrains, whether taken together as left unwillingly by FitzGerald, or studied separately as representative of Omar's point of view at three different periods, alike touch the highest water- mark of the Oriental's faith."], [229, "COMMENTARY 211 When the Cup of Death comes to us we are not to shrink from partaking of it \u2014 and why ? Because, if the soul is able to escape from the body, there is a more suitable place for it than this mean earth \u2014 a place which it should seek by casting off the body's dust. But is this escape, this separation of the material from the spiritual, possible ? It is not only possible but inevitable. The body is a tent in which a great Sultan \u2014 the soul \u2014 takes his night's rest. Death, the ferrash or slave, strikes the tent when the Sultan has left it. Death here is not mentioned in connection with the soul, but with the body. The body is laid low ; the soul goes on its way. There is no suggestion as to any period being put to the career of the Sultan ; he merely goes on his way, probably (as indicated by the forty-fourth quatrain) to the Heavens. As FitzGerald gives us the stanzas we may read into them as much of agnosticism as we choose ; or, if we so desire, we may see in the lines a strong argument for the recognition of the doctrine of metempsychosis. But Omar himself is anything but vague.

The ferrash of doom, because of another resting-place (for the Sultan) destroys (removes or overturns) the tent when the Sultan has risen.' And FitzGerald appears to be even wilfully negating. In his first rendering of the forty fourth quatrain, he does not, as in the last edition, ignore any element of uncertainty. ' Is it not a shame for my soul tp remain in my body, since it can escape from it ? ' he cries. But later his own doubts make the pessimism of the passage more decided. ' Would it not be a shame for the soul to inhabit its clay carcase if it could hope for a happier sphere ? ' is what he seems to intend. And the same gloom is noticeable in the forty-fifth stanza, which did not appear in his first edition. Probably he could not count it among the ' less wicked ' of his verses \u2014 those which originally he sent to Parker, and in a later edition supplemented by stanzas hitherto withheld from publication. The form of expression in this quatrain is somewhat involved, but the purport of the paraphrase is unmistakably agnostic.

He is a man whom creeds of human formulating can not satisfy ; one who asks for proof from the very God himself. He is seeking nothing but Truth \u2014 Truth, that -is, which he can prove to be Truth. But here for a few brief moments he is content to rest on his own inner unproved and unprovable conviction of a future life for the soul, and to give himself up to the blessed assurance, despite all the tormenting fears which at other times come to haunt him. He seems to say to himself with the Ancient Sage \u2014 ' Thou canst not prove thou art immortal \u2014 no, Nor yet that thou art mortal For nothing worthy proving can be proven, Nor yet disproven : wherefore thou be wise, Cleave ever to the sunnier side of doubt, And cling to Faith beyond the forms of Faith !

It lends itself far too well to his general scheme to be ignored, for it is a cry of despair under the cloak of a jest, and it is no wonder then that the translator hastened to add the stanza to his collection when once he had seen it in the French version. The Saki of the inn is merged for the moment in a grimmer Cup-bearer, who pours from his chalice bubbles which are the lives of men. Human existence appears to be of no account in the eyes of the Greater Saki, the God who holds men in his hand as puppets are held, and cares not how many are heedlessly destroyed, \u2014 ' O we poor orphans of nothing \u2014 alone on that lonely shore, Born of the brainless Nature who knew not that which she bore !"], [233, "COMMENTARY 215 Trusting no longer that earthly flower would be heavenly fruit \u2014 Come from the brute, poor souls \u2014 no souls \u2014 and to die with the brute.'1 Omar has worked in many branches of science only to gnash despairing teeth over the short comings of human knowledge ; and, because he cannot see God's purposes, and trace His ways and their beneficent results, he regards the Almighty as a despotic Sultan, who acts from ignoble caprices, and regards not the creation of his hand when once he had the pleasure of making. Omar's God is here a meaner man, with the ingenuity and caprices, if not the limitations, of a man, just as Caliban's God is an ignobler and more whimsical Caliban.

It is not Death that he dreads, but the loss of individuality involved in Death. By his coming into the world he brought it no profit, and his going out of it will not add to its dignity. He is a mere atom thrown into it as a pebble is thrown into the sea, and about as un important.

According to the most ancient of World-Scrip tures the miseries of life are due to ignorance of the Secret of the World, and the outward sign of this ignorance is the mistaken acceptance of the doctrine of Me and Not-Me, or, in other words, an ignoring of the Great Unity. The Sufis also are much exercised on the same sub ject, identifying Being, as I have pointed out, with the sole existent Divine One, and Not- Being with the world of phenomena. All Evil, for instance, proceeds from Not-Being, or, to put it more plainly, from the proneness of man to ignore and deny the Unity of God by recog-"], [236, "COMMENTARY 218 nising Him as an Existence separate from the external world.

Sufi Pantheism, however, is of a spiritual kind which recognises that the universe is the mere reflection of that Great Being of whom alone real existence can be predicated. The Secret is the one which Omar is continu ally trying to discover. St. Paul recognises its existence when he speaks of ' the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,' but he claims ability to solve the riddle, which Omar cannot do, though he spends his life, as he says, in searching for the source of Being and Not-Being. The fault in him is that although he has faith he has not sufficient faith in any one creed or philosophy.

Yet his different lines of speculation seem all to end in finding the one mystery, although it may be no more than a mere breath that separates faith from unfaith, or a hair, as FitzGerald puts it, that divides the False from the True. 1.

Or, on the other hand, it may mean that a recognition of the Unity comprises all wisdom. ' He who knows the One knows all,' says Hafiz. ' The Alif suffices,' as the Orientals have it. The knowledge of the One, the Me, is the only thing needful, for God is in everything and is everything. Omar is inclined to Pantheism, yet with reser vations. For instance, here he appears to commit himself indubitably to flat Pantheism, and in the course of a few more quatrains we shall find him giving utterance to verses which seem to indicate a tendency to the mechanical theory. He is a creature of many moods, and a rejector of many creeds.

It includes all creation, for God is present not only in the heavenly sphere, but in the lower elements as well. For a moment the earnest seeker may cast off the veil of delusion and obtain a glimpse of Him, and discover that He is both spectacle and spec tator \u2014 both creator and the thing created, the Undifferenced Self.

Since man is part of the veil of phenomena which hides the divine Noumenon, when the veil is lifted man must pass away with it. This is one of Omar's fatal mistakes in reasoning. He does not see that man is necessarily ham pered in apprehending the Divine ; that man, simply because he is man, must live in an element of mystery. He thinks to explore by the mere light of human insight the dark spaces that hang behind the curtain of life. If his craving for immortality, and the faint hope of it which is here indicated, could only go a little further and develop into faith, he would find in Immortality the solution of the mystery wdiich envelops Life and Death.

Like Avicenna he has tried vainly to harmonise the abstract forms of philosophy with the dogmatic teaching of theology, and, resenting his failure, he flings thought aside, and comes to the Saki for the fruit of the grape in exchange for the bitter fruit \u2014 the Dead Sea apples \u2014 of hopeless specu lation.

But it is a mere threat of naughti ness, for he does not tell us (though FitzGerald does) that the divorce is accomplished, but only that he has announced his intention of ensuring it. He will thrice pronounce the divorce from his studies, and will take the daughter of the Vine for his new mistress. A Mohammedan is allowed to divorce his wife twice, and to receive her back again, if he so wishes, twice ; but the third decree is irrevocable, unless in the mean time either husband or wife has been married to another spouse.

The sage wishes for no Paradise and fears no Hell, regarding both as part of the World-figment. And in this con nection may be quoted a well-known anecdote from a sermon of Jeremy Taylor. St. Ivo is going on a mission to St. Louis, and on his way he meets a grave, sad woman, carrying in one hand fire, and in the other water. St. Ivo with natural curiosity stops her to question what this may mean ; and she makes answer to him : ' My purpose is with fire to burn Paradise and with water to quench the flames of Hell, so that men may serve God without the incentives of hope and fear and purely for the love of God.'

Lies upon this side, lies upon that side.' 1 The only thing that is inevitable is death, and, since the fear of death is actually a part of human nature, its exercise as a spring of action seems to Omar perfectly justifiable. The fear of Hell is not in this respect permissible, but the certainty of Death is a different matter. Death is a foe to be kept at bay as long as possible, but in the end it is inevitable : life must therefore be valued for what it can give ; and its gifts being material ones, Omar will take them now while yet he has the opportunity. His heart is full of tender affections, and the feared oblivion of the future leads him to passionate denunciation of malevolent fate.

The poet has wandered through all parts of the world, and has met many travellers, but none of those he has met have been travellers returning to the body's mansion when once they had quitted it. ' Woe is me ! ' he cries ; ' that none return to the hither world with tales of those who have departed hence.'

This quatrain is full of bitter sarcasm, and another, untranslated by FitzGerald, contains a similar suggestion. The wisest man is no wiser, so far as concerns his initiation into the great mystery, than the meanest Saki who draws date-wine for revellers.

Elsewhere we have found him, and shall again find him, a fatalist, and we must recollect that in this item of belief, when he held it, he was an orthodox Moslem. But that he could not hold it without wavering, this quatrain plainly shows. He indicates in terms easy to understand his conviction, even if only the conviction of a moment, that it is within man's power to shape his own destiny ; that all deities reside in the human breast ; that the very kingdom of God is within us. The Teacher has told him as much on the day of his creation. And he is inclined to go further, and to doubt the existence of any other Heaven or Hell than these arbitrary creations of the brain.

There is, as Mr. Heron- Allen has pointed out, a suggestion again here from the Manlik-ul-Tair in its idea that Hell is but a reflection of the anger of God. But having indulged for a little in the theory of Free Will, Omar goes back again to his orthodox Moslem fatalism.

It is the lesson of determinism taught him doubtless in his youthful days by his Mohammedan teachers at Nishapur. By God's eternal decree man is condemned from birth to a certain destiny which there is no escaping ; free will is unthinkable for him ; his actions, words, thoughts, are fore ordained. The orthodox dogma is stated as follows by Al-Berkevi \u2014 ' Good and evil take place by the predestina tion and predetermination of God ; all that has been and all that will be was decreed in eternity and written on the preserved Tablet ; the faith of the believer, the piety of the pious, and their good actions are foreseen, willed, predestinated. decreed by the writing on the Tablet produced and approved by God. The unbelief of the unbeliever, the impiety of the impious, and bad actions come to pass with the foreknowledge, will, predestination, and decree of God, but not with his satisfaction and approval.' In Islam, in short, a belief in free will is impossible save at the expense of the Divine sovereignty, and the determining element of Q"], [260, "COMMENTARY 242 salvation lies not in the human but in the divine will. Regeneration is an absolute act of power on the part of God. The doctrine scarcely differs substantially from that first formulated in the Christian Church by St. Augustine, and subscribed to many centuries later by Calvin, and in part by Luther ; and this severe doctrine Omar now rigidly sets forth. The vault of Heaven is like a magic lantern, one of those revolving cylinders common in the East, which turn on an axis to exhibit the figures of men and animals which are pasted on the sides of the cylinder. The sun is the flame that lights the lantern, and men are the figures that revolve in it. They are moved by no impulse of their own, and the result is amazement.

Or again, man is like a polo-ball tossed down into the field, and driven by the mallet of Fate to right or to left at the will of the driver. He has no power to use his own discretion as to direction or pace, but the One who flung him down into the melee, He knows, He knows, He knows, He . The line in the original is, as FitzGerald tells us in his notes, very mysterious, ' breaking off something like our wood-pigeon's note, which she is said to take up just where she left off' The inference seems to be that the wretched ball is made even more wretched through ignorance of his ultimate destination, which is known only to his capricious Mover. Voltaire has a somewhat similar grievance when he likens men to mice in a building \u2014 ' The mice that inhabit some little crannies of a vast building do not know whether that building"], [262, "COMMENTARY 244 is eternal, or who its architect, or why he built it. We are such mice, and the divine Architect who built this universe has not yet, so far as I know, told his secret to any one.' A somewhat similar image to Omar's is used also by a seventeenth - century English poet, who writes \u2014 ' This great All For which men quarrel so is but a ball Cast down into the air to sport the stars ; And all our general ruins, mortal wars, Depopulated states, caused by their sway ; And man's so reverend wisdom but their play.'1 LXXI The Moving Finger writes ; and, having writ, Moves on : nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it. God has set on Fate His inevitable seal, and no effort of man can alter the lot foreordained for him. The Pen has inscribed the Tablet, and its tracing may not be obliterated at the will of any mere human creature. The Wheel of Heaven, that cold, unpitying vault of blue, stands as a type of Destiny. Omar sees, as Blake tells us that he also saw \u2014 ' Heaven a mighty circle turning ; God a tyrant crowned. 1 Habington, Elegy on George Talbot."], [263, "COMMENTARY 245 LXXII And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky, Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die, Lift not your hands to It for help\u2014 for It As impotently moves as you or I. The Persian poets are apt to compare the sky to an inverted Cup, and to see beneath it the good and the wise of mankind thrown helplessly into the world. Man's unasked responsibility, his hopeless impotence, make the compact with the Deity a one-sided one. Omar cannot under stand the God who gives fruits to be eaten by the hypocrite, and husks to be painfully swallowed by the just man, whose portion in this world seems to be 'anger and loneliness, the divine indignation of spiritual exile, the salt bread of scorn, and the bitter wine of wrath.' He appears here to recognise to some extent the Greek idea that the gods themselves are subject to the dominion of the Fates and of Death. Every thing has to give way to preordinated destiny, and even the Eternal is as helpless as His crea tures to change His own immutable decrees."], [264, "COMMENTARY 246 LXXIII With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead, And there of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed : And the first Morning of Creation wrote What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read. Omar does not appear to be responsible for the first two lines of the next stanza, though the sense is unmistakably his, the idea being merely a carrying forward of the previous quatrain. The doctrine is one which vexed the thoughtful Moslem from the very establishment of Islam. The reconcilement of the Divine justice and mercy with the Divine preordination of all things has been a hopeless difficulty since the days of Mohammed himself. LXX IV Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; To-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair : Drink ! for you know not whence you came, nor why : Drink ! for you know not why you go, nor where.

He accepts the Mohammedan God only on the"], [266, "COMMENTARY 248 condition that He shall be responsible for Omar's shortcomings. Determinism is either a happy or a miserable conception according as man recognises Love or a mere dead Will in the ultimate unseen power. Here in these stanzas Omar's conception is at its unhappiest, though elsewhere his contra dictory utterances may show him possessed of a better faith ; but it is necessary to recollect that it is when he is most influenced by Moslem orthodoxy that his revolting soul is at its acme of tribulation, for he knows that the creed in which he has been nurtured, whose professors he sees around him upholding its tenets and sinning against light and love, is but a poor substitute for the moral canon of a perfectly wise and just and loving God. The laws which at times he may be inclined to take for mechanical laws he finds, when he looks closer, must have been framed for individual needs as well as for the cosmic purpose. He has tried to recognise the possibility of an omnipotent God using inter minable and uncontrollable mechanism as His medium, but he finds that in this he has been attempting to believe the incredible. ' What were a God,' says Goethe, 'that only impelled the world from without ? It becomes Him to"], [267, "COMMENTARY 249 stir it by an inward energy, to involve nature in Himself, Himself in nature, so that that which lives and moves and has a being in Him can never feel the want of His power, or His spirit.' Omar's pantheistic bias must have saved him from any permanent adherence to that contra dictory creed which accounts for the occurrence of all events by a kind of mechanical necessity outside the authority of an omnipotent personal Deity. But there is no Pantheism in these quatrains or in those immediately preceding. His inability to throw off his belief in a Supreme Mind acting as First Cause in the universe has made it im possible for him to reconcile his various sceptical leanings, and he comes back again and again to his belief in a Personal God, an ingenious Being full of resources, whose will in the persecution of man it would be folly to dispute. This rigid and cruel Being has made certain laws to which man must needs conform, for he has no power to shape his smallest actions, nor has had power, nor shall have, while the world lasts.

He has, moreover, a sincere per suasion that his faith in the Almighty and his love for Him must gain him a measure of accept ance in His sight. With deep humility and devotion he tells us that in addition to his faults there was implanted in him from Eternity the lesson of Love, and that a tiny particle of his heart's dust was made into a key which may unlock the Mansion of Heaven to him.

To some natures this purpose can be accomplished best through human fellowship \u2014 man mixing with man, their souls acting and re-acting on each other \u2014 and Omar appears here to be one of these. If he can make his devotions in the tavern, this is better, he thinks, than to be without God in the Temple.

LXXVIII What ! out of senseless Nothing to provoke A conscious Something to resent the yoke Of unpermitted Pleasure, under pain Of Everlasting Penalties, if broke ! Yet wine is forbidden by the Prophet, and there fore by God, and the poet resents once more the implanting in him of a desire for the forbidden. He does not, however, use the strong language with which FitzGerald credits him. He merely sayrs that God by virtue of His omnipotence has sent sin into the world, and why then should He choose to burn the sinner at the Day of Resurrec tion. Blake speaks in stronger language than this when he cries in his rebellion and anger \u2014 ' Will any one say \" WThere are those who wor ship Satan under the name of God ? \" Listen. Every religion that preaches vengeance for sin is"], [271, "COMMENTARY 253 the religion of the enemy and the avenger, and not of the Forgiver of sin ; and their God is Satan named by the Divine Name.' The God whom Omar seeks to worship is One who cannot be accused of this masquerading; One who is not vested in the narrow attributes of the Schools ; One who is powerful, forgiving, and loving.

It is an appeal against the doctrine of absolute predestination, as stated in the Koran \u2014 ' Verily, Allah misleadeth whom He will, and guideth whom He will.' The words of the poet have in them a faint hope, combined with an unlimited belief in the omnipotence of God. He claims pardon on the ground that the Almighty knows the nature of His creatures, and, not being lower than they, He will not wreak vengeance on them for being such as He has made them. Elsewhere he cries, ' WThat man on earth has never sinned ? Who could live and never sin ?

But from the Eternal Goodness good alone can come. Fear not, therefore, for you shall find mercy at the last.' We seem to hear in this the words recorded of Heine from his death-bed, ' Dieu me pardonnera ; c'est son metier.' But Omar has a measure of the faith which was denied to Heine. There is in him no apostasy from God. He is heterodox, rebellious, critical, but never negating. His faith in the Eternal is at times even vehement, whether it shows itself in the belief in divine love or the resentment of divine wrath. It is the living spirit of the man ex pressing itself sometimes by faith and sometimes by doubt, these being merely two aspects of the one thing, for faith militant is not a state but a process \u2014 ' You call for faith ; I show you doubt, to prove that faith exists.

FitzGerald had come across it in the Maniik-ut-Tair, and its in clusion in his version is at least as justifiable as his mention of Iram in the fifth quatrain, or of the mourning Sea in the thirty-third. But his use of the two last lines is a very different thing. In them by a bold inversion he represents Omar as offering forgiveness to God, an attitude utterly foreign to the meaning of the original. It is impossible to deny the brilliant inspiration of genius which suggested so novel an idea to Fitz- Gerald for his paraphrase. It is not only daringly original, but it also gives the impression of carrying out the design of the previous twenty stanzas of the translation, and preserves and even puts the finishing touch to their unity. But this last line, the most striking in the whole of the English version, is emphatically not Omar.

He feels himself moved from within, a free agent, full of independent activity, yet informed and guided by a Being who has instilled into him a sense of obligation as potent as that knowledge of his own freedom which he feels to be the essential endowment of a just and reasonable Divinity. This innate conviction does not har monise with the tenets of his religion, and he finds himself forced to fight with present fact and mistaken principle.

Omar reveals in plain language much of that which it is needful for us to know in estimating his character, and especially does he confess to us those natural proclivities which war against his implicit beliefs.

From a conviction of fellowship with the divine he descends into the abyss of human experience, and in neither condition can he find that assurance which could come to him only from absolute knowledge. Omar's faith was imperfect because he thought himself called upon to express belief on insufficient evidence, and he resented this ignoring of his faculty of reason. He could not see that unless faith surrenders itself in the dark there is no room for faith at all. Apparently he was like Jean Paul, who, the longer he lived, was the more determined to unlearn systems.

They require no special explanation. Each one represents the human Ego under a different form ; they speak as men might be supposed to speak, abusing or approving their Maker for the form in which He has shaped them. LXXXIV Said one among them \u2014 ' Surely not in vain My substance of the common Earth was ta'en And to this Figure moulded, to be broke, Or trampled back to shapeless Earth again.' LXXXV Then said a Second \u2014 ' Ne'er a peevish Boy Would break the Bowl from which he drank in joy ; And He that with his hand the Vessel made Will surely not in after Wrath destroy.'"], [283, "COMMENTARY 265 LXXXVI After a momentary silence spake Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make ; ' They sneer at me for leaning all awry : What ! did the Hand then of the Potter shaker' One contemplates with shuddering the idea that this life is the end of all things; a second refuses to believe that he can be utterly wiped out. Another again resents his ungainly form, and has doubts of the power or the love of the Potter in thus making him to be a spectacle to others. 'Shall the clay demand of the Potter \" Why hast thou made me thus ?\" Shall it not ? And why ? Of whom else shall a man ask, and if sure of his God what better should he do ? ' But this pot is not sure of his God. LXXXVII Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot \u2014 I think a Sufi pipkin \u2014 waxing hot \u2014 ' All this of Pot and Potter \u2014 Tell me then, Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot ? ' LXXXVIII ' Why,' said another, ' Some there are who tell Of one who threatens he will toss to Hell The luckless Pots he marr'd in making \u2014 Pish! He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well.'"], [284, "266 COMMENTARY LXXXIX ' Well,' murmur'd one, ' Let whoso make or buy, My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry : But fill me with the old familiar Juice, Methinks I might recover by and by.' Then a Sufi pipkin, with his pantheistic bias, cries out aggressively, ' Where are the pot maker, and the pot buyer, and the pot seller?' or, as FitzGerald in his third edition has it, ' Who makes\u2014 Who buys\u2014 Who sells\u2014 Who is the Pot ? ' He may appear to be subject to the caprice of his Maker, but he claims to be one with his Maker, and no whit inferior to Him. Then another more jovial fellow comes in with a senti ment full of optimism, declaring \u2014 as translated by Mr. Heron-Allen \u2014 They say that at the resurrection there will be much searching, And that that excellent Friend will be hasty ; Nothing but good ever came from the Unalloyed Goodness, Be happy ! for the upshot will be all right.' The last cares for no anticipation or delight but that of self-indulgence, and the joys of the wine-cup."], [285, "COMMENTARY 267 xc So while the Vessels one by one were speaking, The little Moon look'd in that all were seeking : And then they jogg'd each other, ' Brother ! Brother ! Now for the Porter's shoulder-knot a-creaking! ' And then appears the young moon of Shawwal, and the thirsty pots listen for the porter's foot step as he goes after a month's abstinence to fill them from the cellar and to quench their painful thirst. The season of joy and of story-tellers has returned, and all is life and gaiety again. As the Moslem year is calculated on the system of twelve lunar months, Ramazan is liable at times to fall in the hot weather, when abstinence from drinking as well as from food is an extremely un comfortable and inconvenient obligation. What wonder, then, that the end of the fast is awaited with feverish impatience as a release from so burdensome an infliction ? The thirsty pot repre sents the legitimate craving of many a Moslem for the privileges which are forbidden to him at this season of sadness."], [286, "268 COMMENTARY There are various quatrains which may be said to approach a testamentary nature, of which this is a fair specimen. xci Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide, And wash the Body whence the Life has died, And lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf, By some not unfrequented Garden-side. A tender pathos is conspicuous in them, in combination with a bold humour which is too audacious merely to amuse, too quaint only to shock. Sometimes Omar cries for bacchanalian chants over his tomb instead of the orthodox prayers ; or he begs that his coffin may be made from wood of the vine ; or that the clay into which his body will be resolved may be moulded into a wine jar, or into a brick destined to stop some gap in the tavern wall. He has become a sceptic again, and has no prospect of any after life except in the hearts of his companions. It is this continuance of existence which he hopes for in these quatrains, when his friends shall speak of him as one they have loved, and bring him back to their remembrance by drinking from the vessel made of his dust."], [287, "COMMENTARY 269 xcn That ev'n my buried Ashes such a snare Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air As not a True-believer passing by But shall be overtaken unaware. It is a pathetic appeal for affectionate memory, though he somewhat discounts sympathy in this next quatrain by the grotesque humour which possesses him when he jestingly hopes that the passer by his grave may be overcome by the fumes of his former potations. But nothing is more fatal to the proper understanding of a poet than to read him too literally ; the poetic power includes the faculty of imagination, and quaint conceits and extravagant fancies accompany it. Homer has been accused of bibulous propensities because he speaks so often of the ' purple wine ' ; but such evidence of insobriety would hardly be accepted as legal testimony. Anacreon has been accused of giving himself up to excesses, yet tradition credits him with the composing of many sacred hymns as well as the sportive lyrics by which he is now represented. Probably the fault of the accusation lies in posterity, which cared not to preserve his serious work, but only that which dealt with light and joyous topics. It may be said of Omar, as Athen\u00e6us said of"], [288, "COMMENTARY 270 Anacreon, that at any rate he appears to have been sober when he wrote, despite the allusion in the ninty-fourth stanza, which is an invention of FitzGerald. And we may also remind our selves that in all probability he wrote without the fear of the reviewer before his eyes, so that there was little incitement to self-restraint. XCIII Indeed the Idols I have loved so long Have done my credit in this World much wrong : Have drown'd my Glory in a shallow Cup And sold my Reputation for a Song. He appears certainly to have been subject to some amount of criticism from his contemporaries, but, since they were unable to hide themselves behind the veil of anonymity, as would be the case in these happier days, it would be within his power to make things at least as unpleasant for them as they for him. He knows his own instability of purpose, and laments it when he regrets that his Fast has been annulled by a draught of wine, and his ceremonial ablutions destroyed by his indulgence in pleasure."], [289, "COMMENTARY 271 xciv Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before I swore \u2014 but was I sober when I swore ? And then and then came Spring, and Rose- in-hand My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore. He is devout and repentant in one breath, and, in the next, when he is rejoicing in the return of the season of roses, he claims freedom on behalf of natural energies, and asserts his right to unrestricted enjoyment and self-grati fication. xcv And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel, And robb'd me of my Robe of Honour \u2014 Well, I wonder often what the Vintners buy One half so precious as the stuff they sell. He does not deny that wine has rent the veil of his reputation ; he does not dispute the law which men have professed to receive from God and impose upon the world. He merely asserts the claims of nature to enjoy gladness and to indulge harmless desires, against the moral law of a restrictive God as interpreted by his Prophet."], [290, "COMMENTARY 272 XCVI Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose! That Youth's sweet-scented manuscript should close ! The Nightingale that in the branches sang, Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows ! And then, after the forced gaiety of this quatrain, there comes a deeper note, that of lament for his lost youth, and for the purple spring now winter-stricken, and perhaps at the bottom of his heart for life's wasted opportunities. The Wheel of Heaven is coming upon him, and there is no escaping its tyrannical caprice. xcvn Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield One glimpse \u2014 if dimly, yet indeed, reveal'd, To which the fainting Traveller might spring, As springs the trampled herbage of the field ! There arises once more the craving for an assurance of immortality \u2014 a promise that at some future day, even though it were a hundred thousand years hence, he may spring again like the grass of the field. His earthly life is closing, and the imperfection of his physical senses seems"], [291, "COMMENTARY 273 to harmonise but ill with his purposes, which are immortal. The hope, if it is a hope, is but a faint one \u2014 ' Yet, yet, ye downcast hours I know ye also, Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles, Earth to a chamber of mourning turns \u2014 I hear the o'er-weening, mocking voice, Matter is conqueror \u2014 matter, triumphant only, con- tinues onward.

FitzGerald in his first edition does not give us this stanza and the previous one ; they were interpolated at a later date, having been sug gested to him in all probability by Nicolas's translation in 1867. The whole of their con tents may be found in the ninety-ninth tetrastich, of which these are merely an expansion. It is doubtful if the additions can be considered an 1 Walt Whitman. S"], [292, "COMMENTARY 274 improvement ; they relax the tension of thought and of restraint which are so well sustained in the first version. Nevertheless they are essenti ally Omar as expressed in several quatrains. xcix Ah Love ! could you and I with Him conspire To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire, Would not we shatter it to bits \u2014 and then Remould it nearer to the Heart's Desire ! But the translator's genius is so marvellously apparent in the ninety-ninth stanza that we natur ally resent any lessening of the impression there given us. Omar's thought is faithfully rendered in exquisite words, and the craving comes out as fully in FitzGerald as in the Oriental for that unattainable blessing, the Heart's Desire. What was it, this Heart's Desire of the ever restless Omar ? Not mere worldly prosperity certainly, for this he ever refused. Not the joys of mortal existence, for in them he was able and perhaps too prone to indulge. Not the favour of the great, nor the estimation of the pious, nor the companionship of the learned, for of such of these as he craved for he could have had no perma nent lack. What, then, was the Heart's Desire ? We have learned but little of Omar if we have"], [293, "COMMENTARY 275 not realised that it is Wisdom that he seeks \u2014 Wisdom for which he yearns ; the Wisdom which brings a human being into direct relations with the Divine, and, keeping him therein, guides his actions and reconciles all contraries. But Omar, like the hero of Ecclesiastes, in the imaginary experiment narrated in that remark able book, has tried to attain the impossible. He has set out to learn wisdom while his heart still laid hold of folly, and has tried first to gain the one and then to enjoy the other. He has attempted to build on the foundation of know ledge, instead of in and through the spiritual comprehension, not realising that ' The tree of knowledge is not that of life.' The right conception of God does not come from the intellect, nor can the finite hope to comprehend the Infinite while it is still forced to measure all things by its own limited standard. Revelation is to the spirit, and it is the pure in heart who sees God, His self-manifestation being largely dependent on the character of the man to whom it is His will to show Himself. Omar's position, therefore, is wrong from its very starting point, for he clings to the world with one hand while stretching for the Eternal with the other."], [294, "276 COMMENTARY His natural disposition is towards piety, and he recognises that the adverse influences which at times sway him, and threaten the divine in him, can bring him only to the darkness of spiritual decay, yet he will call nothing to his aid except his faculty of reason, which he craves to use apart from God's other endowments. But the intellectual powers must be clarified by the spiritual understanding ; and that moral affinity with the Eternal for which he yearns can come only from a progressive determination in God's ways. He has sought for enlightenment in the Schools, but has found none in which he might gain knowledge or hope or strength. There is no audible answer to any of his cries, or if there is an answer, it is an unintelligible one ; the oracle may not be wholly mute, but the response is vague, uncomforting \u2014 ' One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night ? Watchman, what of the night ? ' The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night. If ye will inquire, inquire ye.' 1 The human cry appears to meet with no 1 Isaiah xxi. 11, 12."], [295, "COMMENTARY 277 divine response. Despite his strong desire, he is not permitted to ' Correct the portrait by the living face, Man's God by God's God ' 1 and he remains one of those who, as Carlyle says, have to realise a worship for themselves, or die unworshipping. It is easy to understand the craving which possesses him to gain this Heart's Desire of Wisdom. In the twenty-seventh and following stanzas he tells us that he has given himself to an attempt to meet God face to face through the attainment of that intimate communion with Him which is the only means of reaching the Truth. He has tried to gain Wisdom because nothing else but Wisdom can bring him near to the Friend \u2014 ' Being but one, she can do all things . . . and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God.' 2 And to know Wisdom is to have the assurance of immortality through insight into the meaning of life, whose problems have always been Omar's worst trouble. Throughout his Ruba'iyat we can trace this ineffectual aim in the ever recurring 1 Browning, The Ring and the Book. - Wisdom vii. 27."], [296, "COMMENTARY 278 'lesson of love' which he never ceases to teach and to learn. For if he has discovered nothing else, he is certain at least that love is the beginning of a knowledge of God and of a future life \u2014 ' Love is the keeping of wisdom's laws ; and the a-iving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption ; ' And incorruption maketh us near unto God : ' Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.' 1 But Wisdom will make no compromise with her children, and even in her most yielding moods she will not solve for them the problems of life ; the best she will do is to indicate an approach to the solution. And for Omar she will not do even this, because she requires first that single ness of heart which he is never able to offer. So the Great Secret remains ever a secret, and the poet ever unhappy because the Heart's Desire will not be his. Other acute minds have gone through the same agony, and have been left to that experience of ' Infinite passion and the pain Of finite hearts that yearn,' 1 Wisdom vi. 18-20."], [297, "COMMENTARY 279 for it is only the lesser ones which find here below sufficient nourishment for their intellect and their love. They do not, as Pere Lacordaire says, discover the emptiness of visible things, because they are incapable of sounding them to the bottom ; but a soul which God has drawn near to the Infinite very soon feels the narrow limits within which it is pent, and sometimes develops a melancholy which has only two remedies \u2014 Death or God. It is an almost in evitable necessity, for man is filled with yearning after what is perfect, whereas life at its highest point is only partial and restricted. The Infinite, while it claims us, ever eludes us, and we are left with the knowledge that there is something indispensable to our wellbeing which yet can never in this world be ours. Our aspirations are unlimited, but our powers are straitly set within tangible confines. This discipline of Use is an element in the experience which is to lead us to God ; it is one of the prophecies and promises of immortality. But human thought is unable properly to apprehend the spiritual existence, and this inability has led to uncon querable melancholy in some of those great souls who have spent their lives in searching for God. This melancholy was Koheleth's, who strove to"], [298, "280 COMMENTARY cure it by the quest of mirth ; this was Faust's, who, having failed to solve the problems of life by much study, plunged deep into pleasure that he might thus still the burning thirst which raged within him. God has implanted in human beings such a conception of the Universal that they cannot rest satisfied with mere details of finite existence; but, though he has 'set the world in the heart of man,' as Koheleth puts it, it is in such a way that man cannot find out the work which God has done. And the Great Secret, for Omar's impetuous and searching soul as well as for other earnest seekers after Truth, remains on the hither side of the grave unsolved. The Heart's Desire is never granted. The mystery which was from the beginning remains a mystery to the end. c Yon rising Moon that looks for us again \u2014 How oft hereafter will she wax and wane ; How oft hereafter rising look for us Through this same Garden \u2014 and for one in vain ! ci And when like her, oh Saki, you shall pass Among the Guests Star-scatter'd on the Grass, And in your joyous errand reach the spot Wh ere I made One \u2014 turn down an empty Glass !"], [299, "COMMENTARY 281 The two final quatrains are as full of melan choly as that immediately preceding, but the sentiment is a personal one. Death seems to be near the poet, and he thinks sadly of the moon which will shine on the garden that he loves, and find him absent. The supreme moment of life is approaching \u2014 the moment of Death. His journey is one which has to be taken alone, and he, who has loved humanity with infinite tenderness, and has ever had a gentle regard even for the insentient forms of creation, must embark on his voyage companionless and unattended. Yet, ignorant as he is of his destination, and uncertain of that future life the revelation of which he has long sought but has never with any assurance found, he craves as a consolation the boon of continued existence in the hearts of those he has loved so well, and leaves so unwillingly. He appears to anticipate the Comtist theory of immortality \u2014 the immor tality of being remembered, or of the subjective life, to which George Eliot refers in her noble lines beginning \u2014 ' O may I join the choir invisible Of those immortal dead who live again In minds made better by their presence . So to live is heaven. ' 1"], [300, "COMMENTARY 282 But friendship's regret is not immortality in any real sense, although without doubt love transcends the grave, and ' Perhaps the longing to be so Helps make the soul immortal. ' Such a longing is in itself hope, for it is the explicit desire of the weak human, who, while still lacking proof of a future life, sees that this continued existence is necessary to fulfil the purpose of God in the consummation of man's nature. It is the solution of life's most vexatious problem, for infinite progress, which is demanded by the moral law from the reasonable being, is impossible except in immortality. This long ing is Omar's, who by the way of doubt and bitterness may have passed to some firmer faith of which he has left no record, for the nature of a thing, as an ancient philosopher has told us, is that which it has become when its process of development is completed. All that we know with any certainty is that he lived as one 01 that great diffident band who have stretched groping hands of mingled faith and doubt ; and of him as of many another baffled soul we may believe, with a thinker of our own"], [301, "COMMENTARY 283 times, who, after much tribulation, 'beat his music out ' \u2014 ' And though we wear out life, alas !

Crown Svo. 6s, This highly interesting book is a narrative of the episodes of the Boer war by a corre- spondent with the Boer army. Mr. Hillegas was present at many of the most exciting and most dramatic episodes of the war. He was with the force which attempted to relieve Cronje at Paardeberg, was present during a considerable part of the siege of Ladysmith, at the battle of Colenso, at the surprise of Sanna's Post. His book, written with dramatic vigour, is a spirited description of the Boer methods, of their military strength, and contains vivid character sketches of most of the Boer leaders with whom Mr. Hillegas was on terms of fairly intimate friendship. Thi* book, though written by one who sympathises with the Boers, is permeated by a spirit of chivalry, and it contains little that can offend the most sensitive of Englishmen. It throws a flood of light on many of the episodes which have been mysterious, and explains the secrets of the many successes which the Boers have won.
