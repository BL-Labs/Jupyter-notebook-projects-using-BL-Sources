BY THE AUTHOR OF \"BENONI BLAKE.\" Crown 8vo, 9s. u These stories are extraordinarily real, not producing the effect of stories at all, but of experiences pondered over and set forth with an almost painful earnestness. The life of the Dyke-builder is the simplest of pictures, but it has true pathos and beauty. The mother's character in its rugged courage is finely drawn. In a totally different way Jamphlin Jamie is admirable, and indeed deserves closer attention and warmer praise, because he is much more difficult to draw to the life. The volume it delightful, and one not easily to be forgotten.\"\u2014 Spectator. \" This author has here given us another half-dozen of his genuine pictures of hard, mud-bespattered* uncomely beings, who, under his hand, take on the colour of romance, and deeply interest us.\"\u2014 Daily Telegraph. \" This author has returned to his true attitude, and holds ground which none may dispute with him. In quiet characteristic pictures of lowly, and apparently un interesting characters, he is unequalled. He has a unique power in gradually wrapping the * dull clods ' of Scotch villagers in a kind of glamour, and makiDg us interested in them as if they were veritable creatures of romance.

But an age has come when thinking men and women cannot be satisfied with nominali ties. Lukewarmness has had its reign ; now zeal for good or evil is abroad in all the earth. Traditions, however ancient and venerable, say the materialists of to-day, shall not stand before the touchstone of Truth. The answer of Gamaliel were not amiss here. If the tradition be not of God, verily it shall not stand. If it be of God, it stands, and shall, to everlasting. People are thinking now as they have never thought before; and people are more honest than they have ever been before. Man's mind is working with a vigour and a sincerity of purpose that seems to be wholly new. The B 2"], [12, "MARGARET. 4 world has had its play-time, and when it wa& frivolous and ignorant it accepted the highest and holiest truths, not altogether from piety, not altogether from faith, but because it was easier to accept than to refuse. Yes, and sometimes because there existed no degrees of ease and difficulty for it. It is easy for those who have never thought for them selves to swallow what is offered them by others. This is too often mistaken for faith. Is it faith in the eyes of God ? I think not. Faith cries, \" Open Thou mine eyes, that I may seei \" as David cried ; not, \" Blind me, that I may accept all Thou givest, or that is^ given in Thy name.\" Does it displease Him, think you, that the man to whom He has given vast gifts of rea soning and intellect, should use these for all other services than for the contemplation of"], [13, "MARGARET. 5 Him ? When Reason has \"reached her limit, the soul that is greatest cries out indeed, \" There is yet more beyond ! \" How should the finite comprehend infinity ? \"Is the ser vant above his lord ? \" God says [to man, as to the waves of the sea, \" Thus far shalt thou come, and no fur ther, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.\" And what shall follow here if not that holy thing called faith ? And what is faith but the boundary line where man, losing himself, would fain lose himself in God? And what is poorer, meaner, more narrow, and dog matic, than that teaching which says, \"Because I see no more, no more exists ? \" The same maxims fell heavily upon the heart of one Christopher Columbus, who dared to believe in something he could not see ; and who, believing, and likewise searching, found .that in which he had believed, after all."], [14, "MARGARET. 6 Honesty is good ; but the abuse of honesty comes round again to self-deception. Faith is good ; but faith itself may be degraded into a superstition. There is a prayer which be seeches of our Father to give us a \"right judg ment in all things.\" We need that blessing very often. In the train that is rolling into Munich, and in one carriage, there is a faith that has been. degraded into an obstinate superstition, and there is a follower of honesty who is verging upon self-deceit. And perhaps there is one who, as nearly as may be, takes the equal course between them ; as nearly as the deli^ cate balance of the human judgment will allow of. Besides these, there is a Frenchman, who is rattling out profane jokes, and talking with impudent familiarity of the \" bon Dieu \" whom he docs not know, and of the \" ciel,\" in which"], [15, "MARGARET. 7 he does not believe. And there is an Ameri can, with opinions like his clothes, very loose and badly put together. The conversation had begun between the American and a young Englishman. Each had given his opinion freely about some question of the day, more or less directly connected with the question of religion. The American, with a bravado that was offensive and vulgar, had given his views unasked ; the Englishman had stated his own without ostentation, even with some unwillingness, because he felt himself challenged by an English lady, who called him to her assistance in \" sitting upon \" the American. \" I must tell you,\" said he, in answer to her garrulosity and vehement appeal, \"that I share some of this gentleman's opinions, and that you are mistaken in supposing I can take up the cudgels against him.\""], [16, "8 MARGARET. And then he had looked down at the Times on his lap with a heightened colour. There was something in his voice, and the honesty of his words and manner, that im pressed one with the idea that he was at least as truthful as the daylight. He had doubts ; he would not therefore that a stranger should suppose him, even for one moment, to be better or other than he knew himself to be. The English lady turned upon him with all the weapons of her mistaken and ignorant zeal. Mistaken in its form I mean ; for so narrow, unchristian, and almost revolting, did Chris tianity appear through the medium of her eloquence, that she proved herself but an ill advocate of her cause. Mere abuse, ill-temper, contradiction, and bold assumptions, will help no cause that is worth helping. The very decision with which this unworthy champion spoke was her worst"], [17, "MARGARET. 9 enemy. People of liberal opinions, and with minds that they would fain think unprejudiced, turn with disgust from all that is narrow, and obstinate, and decided. The men that would have listened to Margaret's well-weighed words and patient manner, treated this woman as a fanatic. God made religion grand and pure and catholic, but men have sought out many inventions to bring it down and to degrade it. No wonder we come to think with the poet \u2014 \" There lives more faith in honest doubt, Believe me, than in half the creeds ; \" creeds believed in too often only because they are not thought about at all. A man's worst enemies are his ill-judged friends ; too often the most prominent of God's servitors are his virtual foes. Margaret did speak at last \u2014 for Margaret is here, how, you will hear presently. And"], [18, "MARGARET. 10 when she spoke, the manner of both thc com batants changed at once. The lady who had been so valiant having delivered herself of all her logic and no-logic, was now maintaining an indignant silence in the corner. The American, who cared little one way.or another, soon retired from the conflict, and betook himself to sleep. And Margaret and the Englishman, who sat side by side, had the rest of the conversation to themselves. They were sad enough, both of them. She with the sorrow of suspense upon her, and he with that weary burden \u2014 a troubled mind. He at least had no unreasonable decision. To Margaret he spoke with the diffidence of one addressing his superior. He had one wrorship left, that of purity and holiness, only as yet he could not accept the beaten track. \" Sometimes,\" said he, \" I can see it all as you do. and then thoughts come, and science"], [19, "MARGARET. 11 seems to go so against it all, and then it is as dim as ever.\" He spoke with such hatred of all that is low and evil, with such reverence and respect for all that is good and true, that even Margaret marvelled, and questioned within herself whether her standard were as high. \" He cannot go wrong,\" she said to herself: \" following purity as he does, there is only one place where he can end ; that is, where he finds purity and holiness incarnate.\" They stopped for a long time at some small station, and no one got in or left the train. \"They're calling at the houses round about to see if any one's coming, I guess,\" observed the American drily, curling himself up to sleep again. \"This is the last station before Munich,\" said the young Englishman to Margaret. \" Do you get out there ? \""], [20, "MARGARET. 12 \" Yes,\" she said. Her eyes were very bright \u2014that had been so sleepless since England had seen them\u2014 but her face was so drawn and thin that it would have attracted the attention of the most unobservant. Her fellow-traveller was very much con cerned. \"You wull have some sherry, will you not?\" and he held the cup of his flask to her, while his kind open face looked anxiously into hers. He had a different face to Mr. Cargrave's ; and yet the impetuous lady opposite would have made and seen no distinction between the two. But Margaret could not taste it, though her lips were parched and dry. The anguish that for a short time had been suspended or con trolled while she talked eagerly and earnestly \u2022to her neighbour, had returned with redoubled force. He saw it, and with intuitive good"], [21, "MARGARET. 13 feeling was silent. No one could have been otherwise than respectful to Margaret : this man would never have been otherwise if he could. As they neared Munich, Margaret came back to herself for a moment, and remembered his kind thought of and care for her. She re membered too his troubles, and she felt sure she should not easily forget the look of sadness on that open, almost sweet face. Most women would have been ashamed to say to a stranger what Margaret said. For most, perhaps, it might be ill-judged, or imper tinent, or unnatural. To Margaret, with all her reserve, it was perfectly natural. \" You will be happier some day soon. I will pray for you.\" The tears welled into his eyes, that were almost childish in their plaintive, searching expression. After a long pause he said :"], [22, "MARGARET. 14 \"If I had lived with good women I do not think I should be as I am now.\" \" Have you no home, no sisters?\" said Mar garet. (I fear most girls would have said, \" 0 no !\" and disavowed the power that good women have.) \"Not a home that does me any good. It has done me harm. That and college together have set me wrong. They are too good for me ; I cannot talk to them and ask about my doubts and my fears. They have not heard there are any such things in the world. I never saw a woman as patient as you are with a fellow who does not think just as she does : not because he will not, but because he cannot do it honestly, somehow. God knows I would if I could.\" And he put his hands over his face and turned away from Margaret. \"If my mother had lived,\" said he, \" it"], [23, "MARGARET. 15 would have been different. As it is, I never go home now ; and they don't care at all. They have given me over to all evil for ever. But I am talking to you and tiring you, and you look so ill. Here is Munich : I will get your luggage out: please sit down on that bench ; the wraiting-rooms are generally too dirty to go into.\" He got the luggage and called a droschke. \"Your address?\" he asked. \"Where shall he drive to?\" \" Hotel Sophienbad,\" said Margaret. Her face was so ghastly by this time that he forced her to take some of the discarded sherry before he would let the man drive on. \"I shall be here a few days,\" said he; \"if I can be of any use, will you let me know ? Here is my card.\" Then he took off his hat and was gone. While the droschke rattles through the"], [24, "MARGARET. 16 white dust of Munich, and down the Maxi milian Strasse, we must go back a little, to account for Margaret's sudden removal from Beauchamp Towers. There is a certain yellow envelope, with the ominous \" immediate \" printed on its forehead, that is never quite a welcome messenger amongst us. Never at least until the contents have yielded themselves to trembling fingers, and sick hearts have bounded to the words of joy and healing. Every one looked round (on that Tuesday after luncheon) when the door opened, and every eye followed with dread the course of the yellow envelope. They were all women at that moment, remember, and most of them had some one to hope for and to fear for. And swift as lightning thought carried them each to her own, and each went through a little dream of fear, and suspense, and hope,"], [25, "MARGARET. 17 \u2022and relief, before the unwelcome missive found its destination. There was one exception to this variety of feeling \u2014 if hope and fear may be called feeling. From the moment that Margaret had seen the swift-footed messenger, who in his haste had crossed the lawn beneath the windows, an overpowering dread had seized her. She did not once make place for hope : she did not once question from whom and of whom the tidings came. Before the footman had crossed the room she was as certain that some evil had befallen Gaspar as if she had seen it written by a hand of fire upon the wall. When she had looked out of the window, and the dread had first seized her \u2014 it was more than dread, it was a conviction \u2014 Mar garet had sat down, because she could not stand, a little apart from the others.

Now it lay upon her lap an instant, un opened. Now it was seized almost fiercely between the cold dewy hands, for a stranger's hand had been put forth to touch it. Philip pine had placed herself between Margaret and the lookers-on, and she laid her hand on her shoulder. She wished Margaret to know the worst, or to put an end to her vain fears, if such they were, at once ; and she hit upon the right expedient when she attempted to open the telegram herself. o \" Ludwig Gessler, Hotel Sophienbad, Miinchen, to Mademoiselle Marshall, Fernhill, &c, London. \" Your brother is very serious ill here.

One at 4.15 \u2014 that stopped at Dray bridge ; two hours to wait there. \" If you went by that,\" said Philippine, stroking Margaret's hair soothingly with her soft hand, \" you could drive home and see your children ; and then join the express at Dray bridge again at 6.15.

The table was taken down to Mr. Beau champ, and Margaret had ten minutes alone. When Phil came back, she was on her knees before her box, packing the few things she would require, and the look of desolate help lessness had been lifted off her face. \" Dear Margaret,\" said Phil, raising her by the waist as if she had been a little child, \" let me do that.

Words that came to her lips a hundred times and more, before suspense itself was suspended, as the slow Bavarian train puffed lazily into Munich station.

The green waves were a little rebellious, the hot bright weather notwithstanding. Perhaps they protested against the unusual weight they were called upon to bear. Mrs. Pickering poised herself upon the narrow bench and leant heavily upon the bulwarks. She was in full travelling costume brown holland suit with a loose jacket, a white"], [31, "MARGARET. 23 bonnet with yellow ribbons, and a large blue \" ugly.\" This last appendage protected her \u2022complexion from the detrimental effects of brine and wind.

One look was enough, eh ? \" Mrs. Pickering whisked her portly person round with such activity as was possible, and sulked.

She was fairly ill before Mrs.. Pickering could even lose her colour. \" I do feel that ill, Pickering,\" said she nevertheless, holding her side, and groaning, and flinging herself half over the bulwarks, \"that I could wish \u2014 I never was born.\" And she looked into his face for some loving re sponse ; for a word of entreaty that she should not wish anything so fatal to his happiness. \" So could I \u2014 almost \u2014 my woman, do you know ! \" he answered coolly. Not being in any way a sufferer himself, the words could"], [34, "26 MARGARET. admit of but one interpretation to any one but Juliana. \" Walk up and down, Pickering, my dear love,\" said she coaxingly, \" or I'll make you J? worse. He was too glad of the opportunity, and strode about with his hands in his pockets, his slouch hat tied down over his ears, and the wind stirring up even his thick bushy eye brows. He was a sociable man, with kindly manners, and a deal of rough humour ; just the man to make friends after a fashion with idle, wind-blown people on the deck of a steamer. But there is very little peace for some people in the world, besides the wicked. Juliana's eyes followed her husband restlessly from point to point. \"Pamela,\" said she at last, startling the poor little maiden, who, really unfit to move,"], [35, "MARGARET. 27 had laid her head upon the bulwarks, \" go and tell your master to speak to me a minute.

She tottered towards her master and gave the message, and then fell back into her place. \" Come to the fore-part, Pickering ! \" said his wife. \" I wonder at your going down there, as you wasn't a gentleman at all. Who'd think what your per-annual income is, to see you hob-nobbing with the low classes down there ? \" \" You go to sleep, Juliana, my girl, and don't fret about me.

With misty eyes she looked round for her husband to help her ; and, failing to see him, she and Pamela reeled to the cabin together. There sleep overcame them both, and the green waves tossed them to and fro in vain. Even the hard old velvet on the sofas was a soft pillow for poor little Pamela, after the sharp edge of the bulwarks she had left above. To the lullaby of creaking portmanteaus, and heavy footsteps overhead, and the seething of the water against the vessel as she cut her way across the channel, and the tramp, tramp of restless and provokingly able people up and down the cabin stairs, mistress and hand maiden not only fell asleep, but dreamed.

A bundle of maps and a crumpled newspaper were on the floor beside her ; on the saloon-table a parrot's cage (with a, ruffled and dejected inmate) swung its brass ring ceaselessly from side to side. Its pro prietress, well enough to be playful, poked her umbrella ever and anon through the bars.

The next thought was, of course, \" I wonder what has become of Pickering ? \" and it acted like magic, bringing back energy and vivacity into the whole frame. Mrs. Pickering had on the wdiole a kind heart ; at least she cast a glance at Pamela, and seeing she slept, proceeded to pick herself up and put herself together unassisted. It was a matter of some little time, and when it was completed, she was aware that her complexion was not quite what it ought to be. Green, I fear, was the prevailing tint ; and this green had been ploughed into small and irregular furrows by the merciless"], [39, "MARGARET. 31 cushions. In fact, one side of Mrs. Picker ing's face was unbecomingly seamed, and one of the eyes, that had done such havoc at Mar gate in the days gone by, was swollen and disfigured.

After a few unsuccessful attempts the stairs w-ere surmounted, and the sea breezes began to trifle with Mrs. Pickering's locks. The \" ugly\" bent and bowed, and the hairs streamed wildly across her eyes ; but they were impatiently removed, lest by any means the object of her search should escape her.

They a,t least maintained the character she had assigned to that part of the vessel ; they were so low and steep that, had not fear and wrath and retaliation armed Mrs. Pickering with a manly courage, she must have given up the attempt in despair. Such a scene was presented to her when she had reached the door, that even the swollen eye assumed its natural proportions, the better to serve its mistress.

They wTere far from being a disreputable set ; indeed, most of them were respectable enough in their normal condition. But under the influence of brandy, sea-sickness, and jollity, and in Mrs. Pickering's eyes, they appeared to be the scum of the earth. To be sure the motley group came in but as a background or foreground to the one central figure, standing up with graceful pro minence among them.

The \" fiver \" may have been collected in the hat, but a second had found its way, I think, from Joshua Pickering's pocket.

Such times happily pass over at length ; and the distraction of landing at Havre, and being"], [47, "MARGARET. 39 called upon to use a foreign language, made a blessed diversion in Mr. Pickering's favour. They found themselves very soon in an omnibus, crowded to overflowing and un pleasantly warm, but on their way to the station for Paris. One of the windows fell down of its own accord close to Mr. Pickering's head. He was thanking it silently for the great favour it had conferred upon him in so marked a manner, when the conductor appeared on the door-step, and challenged him to pay for the broken glass. Mr. Pickering could be very generous to the deserving, but he had no idea of being swindled out of even a few francs.

To be distracted from his own thoughts, not to be left alone \u2014 these seemed to be his ruling desires. Sometimes he was like a little child craving to be told stories, to while away the hours. The day that Margaret came he had dis covered for the first time that she had been absent from home, and upon what business. For her letters had naturally missed him, as he moved restlessly from place to place. He accused her of having hidden her plans from him, of neglecting the children, worst and bitterest taunt of all, of being greedy of gains and regardless of his wishes.

Another week, I think. But we might try a little carriage exercise.\" Margaret ordered a droschke, the best that she could find. But the motion was uneasy, and Gaspar's face was knit with pain. He did not ask again for some time when he might get up. To amuse him she would tell him long stories of her stay at Beauchamp Towers, though she never felt certain that the theme was altogether pleasant to him. But Margaret described vividly, and in spite of himself he would E 2"], [60, "MARGARET. 52 become interested : in Philippine and her sharp retorts ; in Mr. Leslie, with his humility and despair ; in Miss Middlemay, with her mild, far-off echo from the back-ground. Then Margaret would show him Philippine's photograph, and the sketch she had taken of her hi the Conservatory, holding the passion flower between her long lovely fingers. And Gaspar would be amused for a little, and look at it off and on, and Margaret would leave it on the table beside him with his books. Poor books ! They were little read now. If he tried to think, the pain in his head came on imme diately. So there was little left to be done but talking ; and there was little to talk of but Philippine. Jeanie Carter would not have interested him at all. The children's pretty quaint sayings fell on careless ears. He liked to hear about the Beauchamps, about the large"], [61, "MARGARET. 53 house and gardens, about the library with its goodly store of books. When Margaret inad vertently spoke out the gratitude that was in her heart for the order Mr. Beauchamp had given her, her brother's face fell. The intellect that had been so proud and self-confident in the knowledge and strength of its own power was losing ground a little. The keen memory had dimmed. I think Gaspar forgot sometimes in what capacity Margaret had come to visit the Beauchamps and Beauchamp Towers, and when the knowledge was forced upon him again, her stories lost something of their plea surableness. Margaret was afraid to tell him of the arrival of a letter from Philippine, saying that she and her father would be in Munich in a few days' time. Mrs. Beauchamp had gone with Miss Middlemay to Ischl for the waters \u2014 her hus band and daughter were to take a tour through"], [62, "MARGARET. 54 Italy and Germany. Munich was as much in their way as anything else ; in fact, Mr. Beau champ was very anxious to see the Rubens' in the gallery. They did not take rooms in the Hotel So phienbad, but in the Bavarian, where they could have them large and airy, and good attendance. But they were with Margaret every day. Margaret judged rightly when she foresaw that had Gaspar had time to expect them, he would have been sadly disturbed. In small rooms, with no attendance but what Margaret could give him, and in what he could not help considering the somewhat undignified position of utter helplessness, the advent of strangers (especially such strangers as the Beauchamps) would have been most unwelcome. But once aware that there was no escape from them, that Mr. Beauchamp had been in the hotel itself, and that in half an hour he"], [63, "MARGARET. 55 would be at his bedside, Gaspar's cool self possession came into play. \" He is a gentleman every inch, and I should say a clever one too,\" said the father to his daughter, after the first interview. The doctor said it would be good for the patient to be moved daily on to a sofa, so a \u2022small sitting-room was taken opening out of his own. Margaret was spared for half an hour to buy a new blue dressing-gown and a new razor, and he received his visitors for the first time together on the next day. The dressing-gown was of a German cut, and that distressed poor Gaspar not a little. But Margaret's fingers went to work to alter the ugly sleeve and the unbecoming collar, and when the auburn beard was spread upon it, Gaspar still looked a handsome man. Philippine, who had never seen him before, thought him more than handsome."], [64, "MARGARET. 56 Gaspar could be very courteous when he liked. His courtesy to Philippine was very touching \u2014 touching, because every attempt was such an exertion to him, and so many failed Avhile they were still attempts only. At length he had to give up trying to raise himself when she came in with her father, as she did every day now \u2014 sometimes twice a day. He had to suffer her to pick up the book or paper that slipped off his sofa if Margaret were not close at hand. Margaret's offices were accepted by the sufferer as a matter of course. Day and night were alike devoted to him, and hardly a murmur of gratitude or a common expression of thanks would pass his lips. But an earnest \" Oh, thank you ! how sorry I am ! \" would follow upon Philippine's least and most trifling service. Do you think it pained Margaret to note the"], [65, "MARGARET. 57 difference? Margaret was human, and she had human weaknesses. The first, and the second, and the third time that the fact was brought before her, a half-pained, half-rebel lious feeling swelled into her heart. But con quer it she felt she must, and conquer it she did. \" What is my love for him,\" she said to herself, \" if it allows of jealousy ? \" And after that she forced herself to bring Philippine to the front, as it were, implored her to come often to see Gaspar, and told her, what indeed was true, that her presence was the only thing that roused him or gave him pleasure. Mr. Beauchamp hired a comfortable carriage by the month, and regularly as the afternoon returned came the carriage to the door of the Hotel Sophienbad, and then they drove toge ther \u2014 Gaspar, Margaret, Mr. Beauchamp, and Philippine. The party created no little excitement in"], [66, "58 MARGARET. Munich. Philippines beautiful face and Mar garet's dark, sad eyes attracted the attention of many a passer-by. Some wondered if all English girls were as pale as these, for Philip pine's rich, delicate colour was fading little by little from her face, as Margaret's had done long before. When, on the day we have met them, she excused herself from the drive on the plea that her head ached, and walked back slowly to the Hotel Bavaria with her maid, Mr. Beauchamp began to fear that Munich Avas not a healthy place. Gaspar was not so well either. At least he was very soon tired of the drive, and begged to be taken home earlier than usual."], [67, "CHAPTER IV. * In the June twilight, in the soft grey twilight, The yellow sun-glow trembling through the rainy eve, As my love lay quiet, came the solemn fiat, ' All these for ever\u2014 /or ever \u2014 thou must leave.' \" Dinah Mulock. It came to Philippines ears that Gaspar Marshall had missed her from her accustomed place in the carriage, and that he had come home terribly weak and worn. And after that she never more excused herself, and the drives would be late and long. July melted into August, and at the end of August, the Beauchamps were still at Munich. \" I think we ought to be going back to your mother,\" said the father periodically to his"], [68, "MARGARET. 60 daughter. But she was his guiding star, and the guiding star chose to tarry over Munich for the present. \" We could not leave Margaret alone, papa, could we ? \" she would say. Once she said it standing by the window of their own rooms, and looking with vacant eyes at the statues of great men on their pedestals below. She was not trying to distinguish Korner from Goethe, nor to discover if Goethe and Korner wrere there at all. I tliink both of these are of the group, looking blindly out with stony eyes upon the puny passers-by : eternity gazing upon fleeting time. Mr. Beauchamp was reading Galignani in the arm-chair. They were waiting for a hasty luncheon of fruit and wine before the carriage should come round. \"Ah, poor fellow,\" said he, \"it can't last very much longer now. I doubt if he will be"], [69, "MARGARET. 61 here this day week. It would be merciful to Avait and take the poor girl with us. Poor thing ! she will break down after all this heroism.

She drank a glass of water, and took up the paper, Avhich her father had laid doAvn. There Avas a long silence, broken only by the pouring out of some Marsala into Mr. Beauchamp's glass, and the crunch, crunch of the Galignani, as Philippine folded and unfolded, and turned it restlessly in her hands. \" Papa,\" she asked at last, \"does Margaret know ? \" Mr. Beauchamp was at that moment in the preserves at Beauchamp Towers ; myriads of pheasants crossed the retina of his mind's eye."], [70, "62 MARGARET. He had quite forgotten the casual remark he had made to his daughter. \" Know what, my dear ? \" he asked. \" That he is \u2014 so ill, papa.\" \" Ah, indeed ! poor child, poor child ! I never thought of that. It ought to be broken to her. Those doctors will deceive her to the last. Hoav long has he been ill ? \" \" Seven weeks,\" said Philippine. She could have said \" seven weeks to-day,\" but she forbore. There AA'as another long pause, and then Philippine wrent up-stairs to put on her hat. When she came doAvn the carriage had been some moments at the door. They got in \u2014 in a silence Avhich neither noticed. As they came in sight of the Hotel Sophienbad Philip pine said, \u2014 \" I Avill tell Margaret, papa. I think I can do it best. You are sure there is no hope ? \""], [71, "MARGARET. 63 \" There never has been any from the very first. You tell her, darling ; you will do it best. But how will you manage it, eh ? \" \" Let us have a droschke, papa. You take him in the carriage.\" Margaret was standing at the door to meet them. They had groAvn used to see the drawn, pained expression in her blanched face. Only Philippine noticed that there Avas a neAV look in it to-day. Margaret came up to the carriage and took Philippine's hand. She is always Philippine now, not Phil. \" Phil \" Avas passable AA-hen she Avas in her Avilful humours at Beauchamp Towers.

But Philippines grander beauty, her Avomanhood, had fallen upon a sudden, without cause, and under bluer skies than had seen her blithe and girlish. All this Margaret had discovered in the last Aveek of the time Ave have necessarily passed over in silence. That the change could be Avithout cause she could not believe. Out wardly the weeks passed evenly enough \u2014 an hour in the Pinacothec, a drive, the band at the Cafe Reib'l \u2014 such was the order of the day for all, except that Margaret, who at other times would so have feasted on the treasures of the gallery, never shared the visits that the Beauchamps made, more as a matter of duty than of taste. Gaspar indeed varied a little from day to day, and with his health Margaret's spirits rose and fell. Sometimes, when he had eaten some breakfast, or slept soundly for a few"], [73, "MARGARET. 65 hours, or had come home from his drive without suffering afterwards, she would look almost happy for a little Avhile. Then the hope would ebb and Avane, to rise again, and ebb again continually. It Avas like the tide, a sorrowful thing, I think, always, only that there was the lurking fear beneath that one day with the ebb a something would be carried out to the shoreless ocean, never to return \u2014 never to give hope any more, nor fear any more. Margaret in her brave soul had tried to face the possibility from the beginning. When the doctor's visits slackened, and he told her there was nothing that he could do any longer, and when the stronger measures employed at first were replaced by opiates and refreshing drinks, things that might alleviate but could not cure, she had courage enough to recognise that the possibility had become a probability.

They who have passed through dark waters as Margaret did, and with the same faith that upheld her, Avill answer. They alone are able to judge. But Margaret was more than most women tutored in sorrow. Her whole life had been more or less uneasy and troubled. She had learnt as all children of sorrow have learnt, or ought to learn, the lesson of looking beyond her self, even when the bitterness was hers alone. She was not quite sure that the bitterness now was hers alone. The probability had passed into an almost certainty the evening before Mr. Beauchamp had first spoken to his daughter of the hope lessness of Gaspar Marshall's case. Into the agony of that night it is not for us"], [75, "MARGARET. 67 to look. We must see Margaret only as she came doAvn next day, as she stands with Phi lippine's hand at the carriage door.

I should like materialists to have seen her then, to be haunted by the sight for ever : that they might see there is a Far-off reflected in those far off eyes, and that a strength not ours is a verity. \" I will drive Avith you alone to-day,\" said she, anticipating Philippine's plan and Avords. And before Gaspar Marshall was carried doAvn they had driven off. The coachman had told the driver that the Cafe Reib'l was the point daily made for, and F 2"], [76, "MARGARET. 68 he drove accordingly. But Margaret stood up and ordered otherwise.

And then the night had passed over it for Margaret, and not an hour for Philip pine. But after all, what was Gaspar Mar shall to Philippine ? The brother of her friend at least, and a dying man. They drove on silently again through the streets. Then the town, noAvhere dense, be came thin and irregular. They passed under a three-arched gateAA'ay with strange old pointed roofed towers to right and left. The driver turned round and gave its name and history in Bavarian patois.

But to ears used to North-German pronunciation and idiom the dialect of Bavaria and the Tyrol is almost unintelligible. \" Where are Ave goino: to, Margaret? \" asked Philippine at length, as they Avent through the gate on foot.

So many Rizpahs come here, that the sight is common, though they have nothing viler than scattered rose-leaves to drive aAvay from the sacred mounds. Margaret and Philippine walked slowly and silently down the narrow paths. Neither had courage yet to look in the other's face. There Avas no need for looking nor for words. Each had come out meaning to break as gently as might be to the other the sorrow ful tidings known to each. Now the silence and the graves spoke for both. Philippine read Margaret's message ; and Margaret felt that she had read it aright. Margaret stopped at last, and pointed to a pillar of marble, over which autumn clematis had wreathed itself. \" I cannot read it,\" said Philippine in a low A'oice. \" Das grab ist nicht ties,\" it said ; \"es ist"], [80, "MARGARET. 72 nur der Fuss-tritt des liebenden engels der uns sucht.\" \"The grave is not deep,\" translated Mar garet firmly ; \"it is but the footprint of the loving angel who seeks us.\" It cannot bear translation ; such German sayings seldom can.

They passed on again and again in silence. \"Will you sit down, Margaret?\" asked Philippine, after a little. \" No, no ! \" said Margaret nervously ; and she Avalked on quickly, moving from one path into another, till they found they had taken a circle, and Avere at the gate once more.

Philippine thought this calm so unnatural,"], [81, "MARGARET 73 and was so alarmed by the fixed yet wandering look in Margaret's eyes, that she looked round for some seat or resting-place, and saw for the first time that just inside the gate stood a small house, the door of Avhich Avas Avithin reach.

But they did not notice her, as they hurried past, anxious to avoid the crowd coming in. There was a notice outside the door that a mass of Pergolesi was to be given next day. \"Would he like it?\" asked Philippine, in an under tone. \" Oh, he is not able \u2014 but we may tell him of it,\" said Margaret. \" I will go home with you now,\" said Philip pine. \" I should like to.\" Margaret looked at her, and the look meant \" Can you, Philippine ? he would like it if you 53 can."], [88, "80 MARGARET.

Mr. Beauchamp did not notice it at all, or if he did, took it as a matter of course. Gaspar had probably dropped some thing, and Philippine was picking it up. Margaret, through her sorrow, saw it all. What had Gaspar done ? Had Philippine withdraAvn something from his hand as the door opened ? And if so, AA'hat was it ?

The effect upon a nature like his would surely have been fatal, had they told him that the end was near. The doctor told Margaret that it Avould be fatal.

At any rate, there was no chance of any renewal of their brief acquaintance, though the Coliseum, the Baths of Caracalla, and a hundred other places would harbour them at once. And Alargaret, looking at her drawn face and startingly large eyes in the glass, could not wonder that little of her old self remained for the young Englishman to recognise.

The younger, evidently amused at the re appearance of the inevitable carriage, looked up as usual, but with a smile \u2014 even at that distance visible to Alargaret \u2014 and said some thing to his friend.

She was still Aveak enough to cry in womanish fashion over trifles, weak enough to dread the journey alone, weak enough to wish the day of parting over.
