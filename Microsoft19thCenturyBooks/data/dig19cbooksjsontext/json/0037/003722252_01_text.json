The scope of this report has somewhat exceeded my expectations, since, having been undertaken when in a delicate state of health and while attempting to recover from a long and dangerous illness, whatever value it may contain is due first of all to the liberal allowance of time placed at my disposal in Europe, and not a little to the facilities furnished by the Hon. James G. Blaine (late Secretary of State) for obtaining official infor mation at other points, as well as at Venice. It is trusted that the information it has been possible to gather will throw some light on the extent and object of the great land and water surveys of the world, and that it may form the basis of further researches in the direction outlined, which can best be made especially by the large foreign Government offices conducting these works. Should such a result follow (taken in connection with the present illustrations of current doings, accompanied by samples of a number of the best topographic maps), the labor on my part will have been well spent, since only good can come to the cause (that of the systematic and practical development of topographic and geographic surveys) to which I have been able to devote a number of years. Receiving only kindness in all directions, I could not omit this occasion to express thanks to the following from among a large number who have cheerfully afforded information and kind assistance : General A. C. Cooke, Royal Engineers, in charge of the Ordnance Survey of England, and Col onel Scott and Captains Hussey and Beamish, his assistants; General Thuiller, Royal Engineers, late Surveyor-General of India; Prof. A.

Among the diplomatic and consular officers of the United States, with whom it was my good fortune to meet, and who were enabled to furnish counsel and assistance, it affords me pleasure to recall, among others, the late Hon. George P. Marsh, minister to Italy; the Hon. James R. Lowell, min ister to the court of St. James, and his secretary of legation, Mr. William J. Hoppin; the Hon. Levi P.

To my friend and assistant at Venice, Mr. Eugene L. Vail, my appre ciative thanks are especially due for that ready and faithful assistance with out which, on account of ill health, it would have been impossible to have fulfilled the duties there. Thanks are clue Capt. Eric Bergland, Corps of Engineers, for voluntary translations from Swedish text. The timely and generous voluntary assistance of Prof. Jules Marcou (whose extensive researches and world-wide geological studies have so emi nently fitted him for such a task) has made it possible to give so complete a sketch of the Government geologic works. He has contributed, in accordance with the plan adopted for g'rouping and condensing facts, most and in many cases all the data for the geologic works of the English colonies, except Canada and Newfoundland, also Wurtemberg; all that for Alsace-Lorraine, Bavaria, Baden, Bohemia, Hungary, Denmark, Greenland, Russia, Servia, and Spain, the South American States, and Dutch East Indies. He has also supplied notes regarding France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Portugal, India, and Japan, as well as information relating to certain geologic maps with general references to existing organizations; while all the proof of the foreign geologic works has been before him (not including, how ever, the \"introductory\" parts, pp. 76 to 155). The data regarding the surveys of the several countries, all based on official records (published and manuscript), have been made as complete as means and time would permit. Where omissions, if any, occur, information thereof, as well as regards changes and progress for all Government Topo graphic and Hydrographic Surveys and Geologic examinations throughout the world, will prove acceptable for future use. If the facts and conclusions regarding Government surveys, stated herein, shall suggest to older Governments the extension of their endeavors into unmeasured ground, and to others to organize topographic works, and aid in leading the United States to undertake the great general topographic survey of the country as required (thus taking the rank in such matters to which it is entitled), the long and untiring labor devoted to this part of the report will have had a recompense."], [18, "16 INTEODUCTOEY NOTE.

Lincoln, the Secretary of War, of March 30, 1881, I have the honor to submit the following report : The instructions therein provided that I should proceed to Venice, Italy, to be present at and participate in the Third International Geographi cal Exhibition and Congress, and make a detailed report thereon for the use of the War Department. As delegate of that Department, I was to prepare, forward, and exhibit a collection of reports, maps, &c, illustrative more particularly of the later geographical undertakings of the Engineer Department, as well as results, \u00ab that the Signal Service could conveniently present. Before leaving the United States correspondence with other Depart ments of the Government developed a desire on the part of certain offices to participate in so far as the limited time and means would allow, and hence there appeared contributions from the Postmaster-General, Commis sioner of Agriculture, the Nautical Almanac Office, Naval Observatory. tlie Light-House Board, and Bureau of Statistics. The Coast Survey forwarded, through the United States consul at Venice, a model of the Gulf of Mexico, resulting from late deep-sea sound ings, and the Hydrographic Office, through Commodore Baldwin, United States Navy, appeared with maps and memoirs touching their current doings.

Blaine, the Secretary of State, I held myself in readiness for the execution of such duties connected with the Congress as might be requisite or necessary. The report, then, naturally embraces the \"Congress\" as well as the \"Exhibition.\" CONGRESS. The Third International Geographical Congress and Exhibition took place at Venice, Italy, during the last half of the calendar year 1881, under the direction of an organizing committee, with Prince Teano, president, and Prof. G. Dalla Vedova, general secretary of the Italian Geographical Society, as president and general secretary respectively. The Congress and Exhibition were under the patronage of His Majesty the King of Italy, and the presidency of his royal highness the Duke of Genoa, patronized also by the mayor of Venice, Count Dante Serego Allighieri, Senator Prince Giuseppe Giovanelli, of Venice, and by the two \"presidenti fondatori\" of the Italian Geographical Society, \"Comm.\" Cristoforo Negri, and \"H. E. Comm.\" Correnti. Venice, the \"City of the Sea,\" a place of prime and central impor tance when geography as a science was in its infancy, and the theater of the known world was largely confined to the countries bordering the Mediterranean, was selected by the central or permanent committee ap pointed at the second meeting at Paris, in 1875, as the latter had been chosen by a like committee constituted at the first Geographical Congress and Exhibition at Antwerp, in 1871. DIVISIONS OF CONGRESS AND EXHIBITION. The Congress and Exhibition both were divided into eight classes, fol lowing the order of importance of the subjects which as a whole constitute geography, as follows: 1. Mathematical geography, geodesy, and topography. 2. Hydrography. 3. Physical geography, meteorology, geology, mineralogy, paleon tology, zoology, and botany"], [21, "DIVISIONS OF CONGEESS AND EXHIBITION. 19 4. Anthropology, arch\u00e6ology, ethnography, ethnology, and philology. 5. Historical geography. 6. Economical geography, commercial and statistical. 7.

The general sessions were held in the senate chamber of the Doge's Palace, the grand hall having been pronounced unsafe because of repairs then being made to its foundations. The Congress was composed of honorary, effective, adhering, and other members to the number of 1,178, as follows: Honorary 117 Effective 243 Adhering 522 Others 296 1,178 Among the honorary members was noticed (from the United States) the name of Brig, and Bvt. Maj. Gen. A. A. Humphreys, late Chief of Engi neers, U. S. Army. The general management of the Congress was intrusted to a commit tee composed of the president of the Congress, of the president and vice presidents of the organizing committee, two delegates from the city of Venice, and the principal representative from each of the several Govern ments. Fifty-eight questions had been prepared for submission to the Con gress before its sessions began, which number was increased during the interval, and votes were taken upon forty -seven of the subjects embraced. Commodore C. H. Baldwin, U. S. Navy, was present, appearing as delegate from the Navy Department and also the American Geographical Society. Near the close of the last day's session Mr. Me Walter B. Noyes received a telegram from Washington, announcing his appointment as assistant commissioner; too late, however, to participate in the proceedings.

Barnard, President of Columbia College, New York City, of the former, and Brig. Gen. W. B. Hazen, Chief Signal Officer, U. S. Army, and Sandford Flem ing, chancellor of Queen's University, Toronto, of both. Mr. Fleming was present; President Barnard was represented by Judge Daly; and, at the request of General Hazen, 1 presented a communica tion upon the subject of a common initial meridian and uniform time reckoning, with regard to which these delegates had been commissioned. The following distinguished Americans attended the meetings of the Congress: Stephen J Field, Associate Justice of the United States Su preme Court; Hon. David Dudley Field, New York City; and General L. Palma di Cesnola, director of the American Museum in New York City, was also present. Representatives appeared from twenty-nine distinct nationalities, the combined area of which embraces three-fifths of the land surface of the globe, and the population of which comprises more than three-fourths of the earth's inhabitants. There was a representation from thirty-six geo graphical and forty-four other societies, academies of science, and institu tions of learning, independent of those contributing to the exhibition. The Third International Geographical Congress was formally opened at 10 a. m. of September 111, in presence of the King and Queen of Italy and suite; the Prince of Naples and Duke of Aosta; the mayor of Venice; the patriarch of Venice and suite; the Prince of Teano and Prince Giova nelli; Baron de Lesseps; the ministers of war, navy, and public instruction of Italy; Baron Negri; the presidents of various geographical societies; commissioners and delegates from foreign Governments; consuls residing at Venice ; special representatives of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies of Italy; other senators and deputies of Italy and notables from various parts of the world; other members of the Congress, including eminent geogra phers and a number of African explorers ; and representatives of the press. The size of the hall precluded the attendance of guests by invitation"], [23, "21 EESOLUTIONS OF THE CONGEESS. A speech of greeting was made by Monsieur de Lesseps, the president of the central committee, who announced the Congress open; which was responded to by Prince Teano, the acting president, followed by Count Dante Allighieri, mayor of Venice. The formation of the groups was announced and the work of the Congress distributed prior to the adjourn ment of this the opening session. The following explorers, &c, were present: Nachtigal, Cameron, Burton, Massari, Rohlfs, Serpa Pinto, and Schweinfurth, African explorers. Messrs. Vambery and Richthofen, Asiatic travelers and investigators. Messrs Behm, Wagner, and Ball, geographical writers. Dr. Schliemann, the excavator of Grecian antiquities. The Government representatives numbered many from those connected with the large establishments for geographic and topographic survey already so well advanced and brought to so high a state of perfection in Europe. RESOLUTIONS OF THE CONGRESS. The Prince of Teano, acting president, at the session of September 21, expressed the grief experienced upon learning of the death of President Garfield, in the following terms: Third International Geographical Congress. \u2014 Extract from the \" compte rendu\" of the general session of September 21, 1881. [Translation from the Italian.] Prince op Teano. This Congress has received the sad news of the death of Mr. Garfield, President of the Eepublic of the United States of America. Although this event was foreseen, nevertheless it has shocked and grieved us deeply. I think that from a cosmopolitan assembly such as ours, representing science and progress, a cry of anguish must go forth today. Let us express the hope that our work and our efforts may contribute to cancel forever from history these dark pages that dishonor humanity. [Applause.] Count Schio. In reply to the noble expressions of Prince Teano, which all of us heartily applaud, let it be proposed to send a telegram in the name of this Congress to the United States Government. The President.

Certain votes taken by the Congress according to groups are here with, viz : Group I. \u2014 After the discussion in this group of question 2 (What is the actual condition of the telegraphic determinations of differences of lon gitude?), the following proposition was arrived at, viz : No. 2. The Geographical Congress issues the vote that in the coming Congress there may be caused to be presented statistics upon the determi nation of telegraphic differences of longitude. It expresses, moreover, the desire that this labor may be confided to the Military Topographical Insti tute of Italy. The following is vote No. 10: The Geographical Congress expresses the wish that all the nations that are not yet inscribed in the International Geodetic Association may take steps to join it. COMMON INITIAL MERIDIAN AND UNIFORM STANDARD TIME. The following vote (No. 19) regarding the establishment of a common initial meridian and uniform time reckoning, more than any other action of the Congress, interests the United States : [Translation from the Italian.] No. 19. The first group expresses the vote that the Governments may appoint an international commission, within a year, for the purpose of con sidering the subject of an initial meridian, taking account not alone of the question of longitude, but especially that of hours and dates. This commission should be composed of scientific members, such as geodesists and geographers and of persons representing the interests of commerce, learning, &c. The president of the Italian Geographical Society is asked to take the necessary steps looking to the realization of this vote with his Government and foreign geographical societies. This vote was obtained through the exertions of Judge Daly, Mr. Fleming, and myself, after a discussion of the subject, in which repre sentatives from eleven countries took part. This vote followed also the motion of the American delegates acting in concert, and at time of the"], [26, "24 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. presentation of the papers herewith, and marked A and B, together with the joint resolutions found in Paper C, agreed upon after a personal consul tation among the American delegates at Venice. Paper A* Resolutions offered to the International Geographical Congress at Venice, by Judge Charles P. Daly, for President F. A. P. Barnard, delegate from the American Metrological Society. Whereas, since the creation of a vast system of artificial lines and rapid transit and telegraphic communication, extending through wide differences of longitude upon both continents, great confusion in time reckoning has arisen in consequence of tbe use throughout the same districts of country of the differing times of many local me ridians; and Whereas the actual time in use at any place is generally arbitrary and at vari ance, often by many minutes, with the true local time of such place ; and Whereas such differences between true and arbitrary time are in no way practi cally disadvantageous in the affairs of life, when universally understood and observed; aud Whereas it is practicable, by referring the time of all places on the globe to a limited number of meridians suitably chosen, to create a time system for the world so nearly uniform that the minute and the second shall be everywhere the same, and the time of places widely differing in longitude shall differ only by entire hours \u2014 a system of great simplicity, and likely to be conducive to the convenience of all man kind : Therefore, Resolved, That this Congress approves and recommends to the favorable consid eration of the Governments of all nations, as well as to all scientific associations, chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and telegraphic aud transportation compa nies, a time system for the world, sounded on the following principles: 1. Tweuty-four standard merid.iaris to be fixed upon, distant from each other fif teen degrees, or one hour each, in longitude, to which, aud to which only, the arbitrary local time kept at all places on the earth's surface shall be referred. 2. The prime meridian, or that by reference to which the positions of all the remaining one-hour meridians are to be determined, to be the meridian situated in longitude one hundred and eighty degrees, or twelve hours, distant from the meridian of Greenwich, which prime meridian passes near Behrings Straits and lies almost wholly on the ocean. 3. The diurnal change of count in the monthly calendar to begin when it is mid night on this prime meridian, and the same change to take place for the several meridians successively, until the circuit of the globe has been completed from east to west. * This paper is found printed iu full in Volume II of Publications of the Congress, pages 7 to 9, inclusive."], [27, "INITIAL MERIDIAN AND STANDARD TIME. 25 4. The hour of the day at any place to be regulated by the standard meridian nearest such place in longitude \u2014 it being reckoned as 12 o'clock noon at the moment the mean sun passes such standard meridian; the minute and second to be the same at all times and for all places throughout the earth. 5. The hours of the day to be numbered from one to twenty -four without inter ruption, aud the division of the day iuto two halves, of twelve Lours each, to be aban doned. 6. For special purposes, as with a view to promote exactness in chronology, and to facilitate synchronous observations in science, the day and the time of day as de termined by the prime meridian to be employed as a kind of universal time reckoning, under tbe name of cosmopolitan time. 7. For the sake of distinction, the hours of cosmopolitan time to be denoted by symbols and not by numbers, aud preferably by the letters of the English alphabet, taken iu their order, which, omitting J and V, are twenty -four iu number; these letters being also associated with the standard meridians, in regular order from east to west, so that F corresponds to the 90\u00b0 meridian, passing near Calcutta; M to the Greenwich meridian of 180\u00b0; S to the meridian of New Orleans, 270\u00b0, and Z to the prime or zero meridian. Paper B* Resolutions offered to the International Geographical Congress at Venice, by Capt. George M. Wheeler, for General William B. Hazen, delegate from the American Metrological Society. Whereas it is the province of the National Government to establish, prescribe, aud legalize all the standards of measurement to be adopted in their relations with the people iu the collection of revenue, the management of post offices, the protection against storms, tbe conduct of railways, telegraphs, &c. ; and Whereas the time indicated by watches and clocks is an. artificial invention and convenience, intended to facilitate intercourse between men, and has very little to do with the rising and setting or meridian transit of the sun ; and Whereas it is perfectly easy for large sections of any country to abandon the attempt to adopt local mean time in the strict astronomical sense of the word, and to abolish the differences thereby introduced iuto the indications of clocks aud watches; and Whereas the. adoption of different local time leads to confusion and mistakes, and is utterly impracticable in the conduct of railways, telegraphs, and transportation companies (who have already', in many cases, abandoned such local times); and Whereas the actual time in use at any place can only become accurate by being regulated from an astronomical observatory, which regulation can be easily effected at any distance b,y means of the telegraph ; and Whereas the adoption of one uniform time will especially conduce to the advance ment of the study of the atmosphere, earthquakes, meteors, auroras, storms, and other important natural phenomena, more or less affecting human interests : Therefore, * See Volume II, Publications of Congress, pages 18 and 19."], [28, "26 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. Be it resolved, That this association approves and recommends to the favorable con sideration of the Governments of all nations, as well as to all commercial organizations and all scientific associations, the following international time system: 1. That the prime meridian be that situated 180\u00b0 or 12 hours distant from the meridian of Greenwich, which prime meridian lies almost wholly on the Pacific Ocean. 2. That clocks and watches throughout the world be regulated by the times proper to this meridian, or to such meridians as are precisely one or more whole hours distant therefrom, so that the minutes and seconds shall be the same at all times and at all places throughout the earth. 3. That each country adopt as its secondary meridian one that will, as far as pos sible, accommodate the largest part of its area; thus, for the whole of North and South America, the 90th meridian would be acceptable. 4. That the civil day begin with midnight on this prime meridian, and with the succeeding midnights on the secondary meridians, proceeding westward with the sun, until the circuit of the globe has been completed. 5. That the hours of the day be numbered consecutively from 0 at midnight to 24 or 0 at the succeeding midnight, and the division of the civil day into a. m. and p. m. be abandoned. Paper C* Resolutions offered by Hon. Sandford Fleming, and as agreed to by American delegates at Venice. 1. Resolved, That the unification of initial meridians of reference for computing longitude is of great importance in the interests of geography and navigation. 2. Resolved, That the selection of a zero meridian for the world would greatly pro mote the cause of general uniformity and exactness in time reckoning. 3. Resolved, That in the interests of all mankind it is eminently desirable that civ ilized nations should come to an agreement with respect to the determination of a common prime meridian, and a system of universal time reckoning. 4. Resolved, That the Governments of different countries be appealed to, immedi ately aiter the close of this Congress, with the view of ascertaining if they are disposed to assist in the matter by nominating persons to confer with each other, and endeavor to reach a conclusion which they would recommend their respective Governments to adopt. 5. Resolved, That in view of the representations which have come to this Congress from America, it is suggested that a conference of delegates, who may be appointed by the different Governments, be held in the city of Washington, and that the confer ence open on the first Monday in May, 1883. 6.

Resolved, That the Italian Government be respectfully requested to commuui cate these resolutions to the Governments of all other countries. \u25a0 This vote (No. 19), of Group I, having been brought before the general session, it was decided that no further action was necessary than the adop tion of the recommendation of the group in the proceedings of the Congress. The president of the Congress having communicated this decision to Prince Teano, president of the Italian society, he at once requested the minister of foreign affairs for Italy to communicate the subject to all other Governments, with an invitation to appoint delegates, after which, in case of a favorable response from a sufficient number of Governments, there will alone remain the necessity of fixing time and place, all of which is in the hands of the president of the Italian Geographical Society, who informs me also that the attention of foreign geographical societies, academies of science, &c, was called to the matter. The communications of Professor Barnard, presented by Judge Daly, with his remarks, of General Hazen, presented by me, and of Sandford Fleming, are published in full in the printed proceedings of the Congress. It is learned that the action of the Geographical Congress on this point was communicated through the diplomatic channels of the Italian Govern ment to the various geographical societies of the world. The principal propositions that had been made on the subject at the date of the discussions at Venice may be briefly summarized as follows: 1. The establishment of one uniform standard time common to the whole globe, for the uses of railways, telegraphs, and steamboats, for all purposes of commerce, for synchronous aud other scientific observations, to promote exactness in chronology, and for every usual local requirement. 2. This standai'd time to be based on a single unit, measured between two con secutive mean solar passages over an initial meridian, to be common to all nations, to be used for all measured intervals of longitude, time, and all other needful purposes."], [30, "28 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. \u2666 3. The greater number of suggestions point to an initial meridian passing through Greenwich, measuring directly therefrom, or from a point 180\u00b0 distant in longitude. 4. This unit to be divided into 24 equal parts, or hours numbered in a single series from 1 to 24, and the hours to be subdivided as ordinary hours into minutes and seconds, to be defiued by standard hour meridians, 15 degrees apart, wbich as well as all longitudes to be measured around the globe from east to west. 5. These standard meridiaus to be denoted by the 24 letters of the English alphabet, omitting J and V.* The zero meridian to be lettered Z; the balance to be lettered in order from east to west, commencing with A. 6. This unit of hours to be known and held as a day absolute and designated au universal or cosmopolitan t day. 7. Cosmopolitan standard to be distinguished from local standard time by denot ing the hours of the former by letters corresponding to the 24 standard time meridians and of the latter by numerals. 8. Local time reckoning or standard time for a given place to be regulated by the standard hour meridian nearest in longitude or most convenient, it being reckoned 12 o'clock noon at the moment the mean sun passes such standard meridian; the minutes and seconds to be the same at all times for all places throughout the earth. 9. The local standard day denoting the diurnal change of count in the monthly calendar to commence 12 hours before and end 12 hours after the (mean) solar passage at ihe standard hour meridian governing the time at the place, and the local standard time to be known by the letter of this particular standard hour meridian. 10. Instead of dividing the day into halves of 12 hours each, as at present, two alternative plans have been suggested: First. To have one series of hours from midnight to midnight, numbered, con secutively, from 1 to 24. Second. To number the hours from midnight to noon, as now, from 1 to 12, de noting the hours from noon to midnight by alphabetical letters. 11. Standard time to be determined and disseminated under governmental au thority. 12. Each city aud town of importance to have a public time-signal station, elec trically connected with a central observatory, from which all railway, telegraph, and public time clocks shall be controlled and checked. At the close of the first session of the Forty-seventh Congress an act looking to the establishment of a conference was passed, as follows : An act to authorize the President of the United States to call an international con- ference to fix on aud recommend for universal adoption a common prime meridian, to be used in the reckoning of longitude and iu the regulation of time through- out the world. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be authorized and requested to extend to the Governments of all nations in diplomatic relations with our own an invitation to appoint delegates to meet delegates from the United States in \u2022Numerals instead of letters were subsequently suggested for the time or hour meridians. t The word \"cosmic\" has been suggested as a substitute for \" cosmopolitan.\""], [31, "29 INITIAL MERIDIAN AND STANDARD TIME. the city of Washington, at such time as he may see fit to designate, for the purpose of fixiug upon a meridian proper to be employed as a common zero of longitude and standard of time reckoning throughout the globe; and that the President be authorized to appoint delegates, not exceeding three iu number, to represeut the United States iu such international conference. Approved, August 3, 18S2. Communications on this subject were made at Venice by eleven dele gates from six different countries, all of which will appear in the published proceedings. This subject has engaged the attention of the International Congress for the Codification of the Law of Nations, held at Cologne in August, 1881, and subsequently at Liverpool in 1882. A permanent committee of the American Metrological Society has the matter in hand, as likewise committees of the American Society of Civil En gineers and American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Society of Canada, and the Canadian Institute. The International Institution for Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures, of Cleveland, Ohio, have the subjectunder consideration, and communications regarding it appeal' in the published proceedings of the geographical societies of Madrid, Paris, Geneva, and Berlin, while the American Geographical Society have taken steps to assist in the establishment of an international commission. Profes sors Struve, of St. Petersburg, and Forster, of Berlin, both eminent astron omers, have given it their attention, and have favored the adoption of a single initial meridian and a scheme for uniform time reckoning referred to a common standard; Professor Struve, however, pointing out the obstacles from a practical point of view of the latter. Geographical co-ordinates as a means of defining the positions of given points upon the earth's surface were first suggested by Hipparchus, \"the founder of Astronomy,\" who also reckoned the twenty-four hours, or day intervals, from midnight to midnight. The desirability of adopting a uniform time was agitated as long since as 1828 by Sir John Herschel, who proposed the adoption of equinoctial time for scientific and chronological purposes ; while among modern astrono mers La Place. seems to have been the first (about the year 1800) to point out the utility of the establishment of a common initial or first meridian in the following terms: \" It is desirable that all the nations of Europe, in place"], [32, "30 INTERNATIONAL GEOGEAPHICAL CONGEESS AT VENICE. of arranging geographical longitude from their own observatories, should agree to compute it from the same meridian, one indicated by nature her self, in order to determine it for all time to come. Such an arrangement would introduce into the science of geography the same uniformity which is already enjoyed in the calendar and the arithmetic, and, extended to the numerous objects of their mutual relations, would make of the diverse peo ples one family only.\" Col. Sir Henry James, Royal Military Engineers, director-general of the topographical department of the English War Office, recommended the adoption of a first meridian and an uniform system for maps for all nations in 1868, suggesting that of Greenwich (see publication of Ordnance Survey on the rectangular tangential projection). It is understood also that it has engaged the consideration of a number of learned societies on the Continent, while in America, in addition to bodies named, the Time Convention of Railway Superintendents has the subject seriously under discussion, guided by the practical needs of railway con nections and time correspondence. As time advances the benefits of a single meridian of reference for all geographical as well as nautical maps and charts of continental areas will become more and more obvious. Upon examining specimens of the extended general topographical map series of Europe fourteen separate and independent meridians of reference are found: (1) Greenwich, for the United Kingdom and India; (2) Paris, for France,\" Algeria, and Switzerland; (3) Lisbon, for Portugal; (4) Rome, for Italy; (5) Amsterdam, for Holland; (6) Isle of Ferro, westernmost of the Canaries, for Prussia, Saxony, Wurtemberg, and Austria; (7) Ferro and Christiana, for Norway; (8) Copenhagen, for Denmark; (9) Madrid, for Spain;* (10) Stockholm and Ferro, for Sweden; (11 and 12) Ferro, Pul kowa, Warsaw, and Paris, for Russia; (13) Brussels, for Belgium; and (14) Munich, for Bavaria. Both Greenwich and Washington, principally the former, have been used for maps of land areas in the United States. The meridian of Green- * Spain at different epochs has counted longitude from no less than eleven distinct and separate meridians."], [33, "31 INITIAL MEEIDIAN AND STANDAED TIME. wich is used on the Government marine charts of England, and India, Prussia, Austria, Russia, Holland, Sweden and Norway, Denmark, and the United States; while France employs Paris; Spain, Cadiz; Portugal, Lis bon, and Naples is found on some Italian as well as likewise Pulkowa on certain Russian hydrographic charts. As. will be seen from the above, for the greater part of the nautical charts of the world the meridian of Green wich has been taken, the British Admiralty issuing more of these charts than any single nation. After the introduction of geographical co-ordinates for defining and fixing terrestrial positions, the meridian of reference first used to any great extent was a principal meridian assumed as passing through the most westerly of the group of Fortunate Islands (now known as the Canaries), supposed then to be the most westerly land in the known world; but the co-ordinates of this point were not established except by arbitrary assumption of distance from the astronomical observatory at Alexandria, which substantially enjoys the distinction of being the first well-authenticated meridian of reference. As nautical and astronomical tables came into more general use a number of meridians of reference were established, as at Toledo, Cracow, Uranibourg, Copenhagen, Goes, Pisa, Nuremberg, Augsburg, London, Paris, Rome, Greenwich, Washington, Vienna, Ulm, Berlin, Tubingen, Venice, Bologna, Rouen, Dantzig, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, &c. The connection ofthe meridians ofthe astronomical observatories at the several places thus established has, since the introduction of the telegraphic methods of time comparison, been made in many cases with great accuracy, and can now be ascertained for all, so that the probable errors of the differ ences of longitude have been or can be rendered inappreciable ; and hence, with more than former certainty, in the above tables reference can be made to a single meridian in all the publications, and their common value height ened and uses simplified. One of the delegates from France advocated, in addition to the estab lishment of uniform time, and an initial meridian, a metrical division of both time and arc, as well as calendar divisions; a step in advance, but as yet perhaps somewhat premature."], [34, "32 INTEENATIONAL GEOGEAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE.

At a meeting of the General Time Convention of Railway Superin tendents and Managers at Saint Louis, Mo , April 11, 1883, the following resolutions regarding a uniform time standard, based on hour differences, presented by the secretary, Mr. W. F. Allen, were adopted : Resolved, That this convention recommends the adoption of the following as the future standards for the use of the railway lines of the country: 1st. That all roads now using Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Toronto, Hamilton, or Washington time as standard, based upon meridians east of those points or adjacent thereto, shall be governed by the 75th Meridian or Eastern time (4 minutes slower than New York time). 2d. That all roads now using Columbus, Savannah, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Indianapolis, Chicago, Jefferson City, Saint Paul, or Kansas City time, or standards based upon meridians adjacent thereto, shall be run by the 90th Meridian time, to be called Central Time (one hour slower than Eastern Time and nine minutes slower than Chicago Time). 3d. That west of the above-named sections the roads shall be run by the 105th and 120th meridian times, respectively two and three hours slower than Eastern Time. # # ' * * # # * Note. \u2014 Time referred to 105th Meridian is designated Mountain Standard Time; that referred to 120th Meridian, the Pacific Standard Time, 1366 WH 3"], [36, "34 INTEENATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. The same resolutions were also adopted at the General Time Conven tion at New York City, April 18, 1883. This system of time standards was approved for adoption by the association of American Railroad Superin tendents at their meeting in Chicago, May 28 and 29, 1883, while at the meeting of October 11, 1883, roads aggregating 78,158 miles had agreed to the adoption of these standards, and the system went generally into effect November 18, 1883.* The 75th meridian time was adopted as the standard for the District of Columbia by act approved March 13, 1884, while certain departments anticipating legislative action have made use of the same standard,! as also the Signal Service at its several widely sepa rated stations. From the important action taken at the Venice Congress (which was communicated to the Italian Government by Prince Teano, president of the Italian Geographical Society at Rome, and thence to foreign Governments, as well as scientific societies), appears to have sprung the discussion at the meeting of the Seventh General Conference of the International Geodetic Association, in Rome, Italy, in October, 1883, where resolutions to the fol lowing effect were adopted: The unification of longitude and time is desirable in the interest of science, navi gation, commerce, and international communications; aud the scientific and practical utility far surpasses the sacrifices necessary to attain it. A uniform system of longi tudes, to be adopted by an international convention, is recommended for all institutes aud geodetic bureaus, especially for geographic and hydrographic maps, as well as in all astronomical and nautical ephemerides, except where it is more convenient to retain a local meridian. For practical considerations the subject of the decimal divis ion of the quadrant should be kept apart from the measure of unification proposed, while it is recommended, pending the multiplication and perfection of tables, that this system be employed in the most important operations of numerical calculations, although the sexagesimal division be preserved for observations, and maps, in navi gation, &c. It was proposed to select for an initial meridian, the one defined by * The above and similar additions have been introduced while proof-reading, June, 1885. tThe Naval Observatory on December 4, 1884, issued a General Order, announcing that on and after January 1, 1885, \" the astronomical day shall be considered as beginning at midnight ;\" this was suspended on December 29, 1884, in deference- to the views of Prof. Simon Newcomb, the Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, until the Ephemerides are constructed in accordance with, and a general concert of action had upou the recommendation of the late International Meridian Conference. (See Senate Ex. Doc. No. 78, 48th Cong., 2d sess.) Prof. Newcomb also takes the ground that the change should not be made at all, unless stronger reasons than those hitherto advanced are presented, and even then only at some common date agreed upon by all astronomers, the beginning of the coming century being suggested as a convenient epoch.

The Conference recognized, for certain scientific wants and for the internal admin istration of railroad and steamship lines, telegraph, and posts, the utility of adopting a universal hour, besides local and national hours, which shall necessarily be employed in civil life, aud the point of departure recommended for universal hours aud cosmo politan dates is the mean noon of Greenwich, which coincides with the instant of midnight, or the commencement ofthe civil day, at the meridian of 180\u00b0 from Green wich, the hours to be counted from 0 to 24. It was decided to bring the resolutions to the knowledge and favorable consider ations ofthe Governments, to the end that an international convention, dedicated to the unification, of longitudes aud hours, may be speedily attained through a special conference, such as that proposed by the United States. The above abstract has been taken from a copy (in French) of the resolutions of the association, furnished by the late Mr. R. D. Cutts, Assist ant, United States Coast Survey, and delegate to the Convention at Rome. When a sufficient number of favorable responses to the State Depart ment circular, growing out of the act of 1882, had been received, the Presi dent issued invitations to an International Conference to which twenty-five countries responded by sending delegates. This International Meridian Conference, of which C. R. P. Rodgers was President, and R. Strachey, J. Janssen, and L. Cruls, were Secretaries, assembled at Washington, and adopted the following resolutions on October 22, 1884. (See House Ex. Doc. No. 14, Forty-eighth Congress, second session, pp. 111-113.) The President of the United States of America, in pursuance of a special pro vision of Congress, having extended to the Governments of all nations in diplomatic relations with his own, an invitation to send delegates to meet delegates from the United States in tue city of Washington, on the 1st of October, 1884, for the purpose of discussing, and, if possible, fixing upon a meridian proper to be employed as a common zero of longitude and standard of time-reckoning throughout the whole world, this International Meridian Conference assembled at the time aud place designated, and, after careful and patient discussion, has passed the following resolutions : I. *\u25a0' That it is the opinion of this Congress that it is desirable to adopt a single prime meridian for all nations, in place of tlie multiplicity of initial meridians which now exist.'\" This resolution was unanimously adopted.

II and IV of the Proceed ings of the American Metrological Society, and in the paper read by Mr. Fleming before the Canadian Institute in December, 1884. It is stated that Prof. Charles Dowd, of Saratoga, N. Y , was the first to present a plan for a national standard time based on hour differences in October, 1869. Prof. Otto Struve presented a paper on the subject of a prime meridian to the Geographical Society of Russia on February 4, 1870, recommending from a geographical standpoint Greenwich as a common meridian. The International Geographical Congress at Antwerp in 1871 recom mended the adoption of the meridian of Greenwich for marine charts, but that each country, for coasting charts and maps of its own territory, should adhere to the meridian then already in use. One of the groups at the Inter national Geographical Congress at Paris in 1875 took the view that action on the question of a prime meridian was not appropriate, expressing, however, the opinion and hope that a single meridian should be adopted, leaving the selection to an international commission. On May 19, 1875, the American Meteorological Society appointed a committee and adopted resolutions favoring action to secure the adoption of a uniform standard of time. \u00bb In May, 1879, Professor Abbe, as chairman, made a report embracing both meridian and time, referring to a suggestion originally made by Prof. Benjamin Peirce, as to standard meridians exactly four, five, and six hours west of Greenwich. (See Vol. II, Proceedings American Metrological So ciety, p. 25 ) Note. \u2014 Material assistance in obtaining information has been furnished by Professors Barnard, Abbe, and Rees, Mr. Sandford Fleming, and also Mr. Sevellon Brown, chief clerk, State Department."], [40, "38 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. Professor Barnard, as president of the American Metrological Society, has taken a pronounced interest in the subject, presenting it to the Associa tion for the Reform of the Laws of Nations in 1881 at Cologne Mr. Sand ford Fleming appeared in behalf of the matter (about which he had hitherto written) in 1878, since which date he has been one of its most active supporters Mr. Beaumont, president of Geneva Geographical Society, and Pro fessor Chancourtois, of the School of Mines, Paris, entered largely into the discussions at Venice. Standard time for railroad purposes seems first to have been formally acted upon at? a convention of the Railway Association of America in May 1873, when it was deferred until the public interest should appear to cal' for it In October, 1881, at the General Railway Time Convention, the whole subject was referred to the secretary (Mr W. F. Allen) for report. By request he formulated the propositions arrived at in October, 18*2, and when presented to the General Time Convention at Saint Louis, April 11, 1883, they were favorably received, adopted, and are now in general use for railroad purposes in the United States and Canada. Meanwhile Congress passed the act of August 3, 1882, legalizing the call for a meridian conference, whereupon circulars were issued by the State Department to all countries holding diplomatic relations with our own, to elicit comment and arrive at a common understanding, which latter being had, the conference of 1884 was called and held at Washington, with results as herein stated. A formulated proposition now awaits final adoption by the several Governments, the railway, steamboat, and telegraph lines, and the commu nity at large. Only a crude outline of this important matter, with the data at dis posal, has been attempted, in the hope that thereby may be awakened a wider interest wherever this report shall reach. Among others known to have contributed, and whose names are not found in the list of publications, are Mr. Christy, the English Astronomer Royal, as well as his predecessor, Sir G. B. Airy; Prof. Piazzi Smith, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, Pro fessor Thury, University of Geneva, and Monsieur Germain, Hydrographic Engineer, French Navy."], [41, "39 RESOLUTIONS OF THE CONGRESS. The following votes may be found of special interest : Group 7. \u2014 Considering the importance of emigration, even as a geo graphical fact, the Congress wishes : (a) That it may please the Governments to continue and develop statistical researches upon emigrations and immi grations, distinguishing the permanent from the temporary, not confining them to the collection of numerical data, but pushing their researches to the examination of the causes of these movements and to their results, espe cially in the view of commerce and navigation. Group 2. \u2014 No. 22. The second group utters the vote that all the Gov ernments should secure the trigonometric data for the determination of the exact geographical position of the light-houses when these structures are established, and recommends to the maritime nations to examine and prove that the lights existing may be joined in a network of triangulation. No. 24. The third group desires that whenever magneto-meteorologic stations are established in the polar regions, after the plan of Monsieur Weyprecht, there be located also meteorological stations of inferior order, which may be connected with stations in middle latitudes, each in the same meridian, where observations have been made for several years. No. 27. The third gimip expresses the vote that the meteorological observations made on mountains, and, in general, at great altitudes, may be published \"in extenso,\" relying above all upon the vote formulated by the Meteorological Congress at Rome upon the proposition of Dr. Hann. No. 29. The third group having learned with satisfaction that hereafter the observations of the superficial temperature of the soil will be registered at the meteorological stations of Italy and France, expresses the wish that similar observations may be made elsewhere, and especially at mountain stations. No. 36. The fourth group expresses the wish that the compilation of a universal phonetic alphabet be undertaken. Group 7. \u2014 No. 39. In relation to Theme I, question 1, the seventh group has established the following maxims : (a) The scientific object of geography comprehends the study of the superficial forms of the earth ; it extends also to the reciprocal relations of the different branches of the organic world."], [42, "INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. 40 (b) Geography, although a special science, borrows, nevertheless, from other sci ences all that is necessary to obtaiu completely its end. (c) That which eminently distinguishes geography from the auxiliary sciences is that it localizes objects ; that is to say, it indicates in a positive and constant manner the distribution of beings, organic and inorganic, upon the earth. \u25a0 It was impossible, on account of ill health, to attend but a few of the sessions of the various groups, hence I was unable to suggest in place of the above, as had been intended, a possibly more practical view of the scope to be assigned to geography expressed somewhat as follows : As a branch of physical science the domain of geography is limited alone by- the ultimate measure, as accurate as science can make it, of the entire inorganic globe, as well as of the reciprocal relations of all forms of organic life; in its utilitarian sense it is the adaptation ofthe means afforded by all known scientific methods (applicable alike to celestial and terrestial objects aud phenomena) to the accomplishment of this end, ever subordinating its endeavor to the current wants of man. No. 40. The seventh group, considering that the representation of mountains by hachures gives a false idea of the relief, expresses the desire that in the elementary atlases there may be adopted as soon as possible the system of representation by level-curves of a single color, or plain colors superposed, and the sea-depths in like manner. No. 41. The seventh group notices with satisfaction the progress already made pursuant to the decisions of the congresses of Antwerp and Paris, and renews these votes, insisting principally upon the following points: (\u00ab) Application of a topographic system which should bring to cartography a form always more complete. (b) Augmentation of time devoted to geography. (c) Creation of special chairs for superior instruction in geography, and with a special diploma. No 42. The seventh group submits to all nations the following questions: PRIMARY INSTRUCTION I. Primary schools: To what extent are topographical methods taught\"? Have topographical walks been organized\"? How many hours per week have been set apart for this instruction ? II. Primary superior schools : The same questions, and the following: Has there been established scholastic excursions during vacations? III. Normal school for tutors and governesses: The same. SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. The same, and the followiug : What topographical maps are employed ? Are ihere special professors of geography . If there are not, what professors are charged"], [43, "41 RESOLUTIONS OF THE CONGRESS. with that instruction 'I Is there selected from the course of geography a locality of special and great geographical interest ? How are the different courses of geography distributed ? SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. Do special chairs of geography exist in the faculties of science and letters? Bring up to. date an exact list of these chairs. Does there exist special grades carry ng baccalaureate, admission, doctorship, and other diplomas . AUXILIARY SCHOOLS. What is the organization of these schools in the different countries . No. 43. The seventh group expresses the wish to see determined and fixed uniformly both the colors and signs to indicate the heights and depths and the different kinds of \"terrain\" in all the geographical maps and atlases after such fashion that at the next Congress a uniform system may be pre sented. No. 45. The eighth group expresses the desire that the savans of each country prepare for the future Congress complete lists of their scientific explorers and travelers who shall have made explorations (aided by instruments) in various parts of the world, after the date of the present Congress. It expresses the desire to see this work executed, or at least verified, by the geographical society of each country. No. 47. The eighth group wishes that there be instituted a central office, serving as an intermediary for the communications that the geographi cal society may have to send for the propagation of the votes of the Con gress, and for reciprocal communications, the most general and important. At the closing of the last day's session, Prince Teano pronounced a valedictory discourse, in recitation of the results of the Congress, being followed by Baron Negri, and responded to by Lord Abedare, President of the London Royal Geographical Society, answering for all the geographical societies represented*, when the Third International Congress was declared closed by Prince Teano in the name of the Duke of Genoa.

The general staff exhibited plans of various cities at the scale of 1:5,000; Don Francis Coello, Colonel of Engineers, retired, his excellent and complete atlas of Spain and its possessions (scales 1:200,000 and 1:100,000); and the observatory at Madrid, eighteen volumes of annuals from 1861 to 1880. Germany. \u2014 Cartographic works, embracing the whole Empire, were"], [66, "64 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. exhibited by the general staff survey of Prussia; there were instruments of precision (among them specially worthy of mention five-inch theodolites, with reading microscopes, and an instrument for testing circle divisions, by Wan schaff, of Berlin), and triangulation map of Schleswig and Holstein; a com plete collection of all instruments or mechanical appliances used in surveying, specimen of an original plane-table sheet (1:25,000) in curves; lithographic samples (1:25,000) for immediate use and sale; also engraved sheets of the general topographic map of Germany (scale 1:100,000), independent of maps of cities and their environs (scales from 1:25,000 to 1 :100,000) ; a num ber of sheets of the Reymann chart of Central Europe (scale 1:200,000) of the year 1817 and up to date, illustrating progress in cartography; also heliographic maps of Alsace and Lorraine (scale 1:50,000). Trigonometric and topographic instruments of precision (of apparently fine patterns, solid and well finished,) were displayed by Sprenger, and also by Bamberg, ol Berlin, and by Breithaupt and Son; also Arwed, of Cassel. The Royal Bavarian Topographical Bureau exhibited among other objects sheets of the general topographic atlas of Bavaria (scale 1:50,000), a fine production. The Grand Ducal Topographical Bureau of Baden displayed several sheets of the special topographic map of the Duchy (scale 1:25,000). This map. in curves, is exceedingly clear and pleasing. Switzerland. \u2014 The Federal Topographical Bureau at Berne presented original drawings of sheets of the special topographical atlas (scales 1:50,00( and 1:25,000), based on a revision of the original Dufour survey, with printsi therefrom; also original drawings of the Dufour atlas (scale 1:100,000) The Swiss geodetic commission appeared with several publications relating to its labors. Various instruments of precision for geodetic, topographic, and leveling works were noticed from the establishments of J. Kern, Arau and Holtinger & Co., Zurich. Japan. \u2014 The exhibits came entirely from the Government and the Society of Geography of Tokio. Noticeable was a small-scale map of the Empire (1877) in two colored sheets, with another lately made, and plans of Tokio and Kioto, including a few maps of islands. Belgium. \u2014 The Military Cartographic Institute made a highly creditable display of the general and special topographical maps (scales 1:40,000 ard"], [67, "EXHIBITION BY CLASSES. 65 1:20,000), which, with a hypsometric chart (scale 1:800,000), and a relief map (scale 1:400,000), and various publications bearing upon the subject of Class I, proved highly interesting. Egypt. \u2014 This was the only African country represented. Fine cadastral charts of the Khedive's dominions were exhibited. Brazii . \u2014 There appeared a final report from the Commission upon the general map of Brazil (1875). Argentine Republic. \u2014 More than two hundred and fifty articles were shown by about one hundred exhibitors from Government, societies, and individuals. Of special mention are the astronomical works of Professor Gould, a ground plan of Buenos Ayres, and a general map of Patagonia, by Captain Moyano, of the army, the Government representative at Venice. Francf. \u2014 France was well represented, both from a Government and private point of view. The Geographical Service of the War Department, the mother geographic and topographic work of France, sent examples of its later productions, such as its maps of French territory, on the scales of 1:800,000, 1:600,000, 1:200,000, 1:80,000, 1:50,000, and 1:20,000, with many specimens of divers topographic studies and results. These, together with the Government map of the interior and public works departments, as well as those of private publishers, would appear to give France a lead ing, if not the leading, place among the topographic and orographic map producers of the world. The instruments employed in the astronomical and geodetic branches of this work (constructed by Brunei- Brothers, of Paris) merit special mention. The general map of France (completed), scale 1:500,000, prepared by the fortification branch, as well as its topograph ical section engaged in surveys of the sites of and approaches to fortified places, completes the most important of the articles noticed. Austria. \u2014 Special attention is due to the following objects: Specimens of the new topographic map of the empire (scale 1:75,000), seven hun dred and fifteen sheets, of which three hundred and ninety have been com pleted in nine years, reproduced by heliogravure; a type copper-plate, prepared by heliogravure, of a special sheet (1:75,000), as well as a photo zincograph plate, with proof sheets therefrom; a new special map in colors of Vienna and environs (scale 1:12,500); school maps (scale 1:25,000 and 1306 WH 5"], [68, "66 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. 1:75,000); a pamphlet, by Major Volkmer, entitled \"The execution and reproduction of military maps and plans of the Military Geographical In stitute,\" with an atlas of fifty-five proof-sheets of specimens, showing differ ent methods of reproduction, also the direct enlargement of the original plane-table sheets (scale 1:25,000) to 1:7,500 for the war game or kriegsspiel. England and India. \u2014 The exhibits from England were peculiarly of a topographic and hydrographic character. Specially meritorious were the ordnance survey maps of scales 1:63,360, 1:10,560, 1:2,500, 1:1,056 and 1:500, being the general topographic, county, cadastral, and city maps. The survey of India presented, mounted in wall-form, samples of its topograph ic atlas (covering, next to Russia, the largest area of any single survey) on the scale of 1:255,561, with various maps of the Himalaya, Afghanistan, and other regions on different scales, together with man)- publications of this great and worthy work. Special mention should be made of a self registering tide-gauge, consisting of a cylinder with clock-work machinery, for registering tides of all amplitudes, constructed by Adie, of London, with the modifications suggested by Captain Baird, Royal Engineers Russia.\u2014 The exhibits were more particularly from official sources and the Geographical Society. They were worthy of more attention than could possibly be extended, but a few among the many works of prominence are: The general topographic map of the empire, with a trigonometric basis, being executed on scale 1:126,000; another on the smaller scale 1:42000, with specimens of field minutes for Russia and Finland of 1:21,000, and in the Balkans of 1:42,000 and 1:84,000. There are now seven topo graphical sections, issuing maps and other publications, the central one being at St. Petersburg; of these there were present the Caucasus, Taschent, Omsk, Tiflis, and Orenburg. There should also be mentioned a new map of European Turkey, scale 1:126,000, and of Afghanistan, scale 1:2,100,000. There are special maps of the Balkans from works of 1877-78; also of Arctic Russia, Turkestan, and Khiva on small scales, with an index map showing progress of these works in Finland, and cadastral maps with a relief of Moscow, and various publications relating to all these matters. The Geographical Society were enabled to make also a liberal display ot its labors since 1875. Fine astronomical and geodetic instruments made"], [69, "EXHIBITION BY CLASSES. 67 by Repsold at Hamburg, after Russian designs, were also a marked feature of the exhibit, which was most ample and interesting. Sweden. \u2014 Maps of the general staff of the entire kingdom (scale 1:100,000) and of a few separate departments (scale 1:200,000) were most worthy objects in the first class.

Germany. \u2014 From the Hydrographic Bureau of the Admiralty there came new nautical charts of the German and adjacent seas; and from the Naval Observatory at Hamburg, sheets of an atlas of air and ocean cur rents of the Atlantic, executed after Captain Maury's method. Italy. \u2014 The Hydrographic Office at Genoa (Commandante Magnaghi) was the principal exhibitor ; about fifty well executed charts and plans of harbors were noticed, also an interesting collection of instruments and pub lications relating to this work, a description of which is given later on, show ing that Italy no longer restricts her hydrographic work to home waters, as witness the voyages of the Magenta, the Vetter, Pisano, and others. Belgium. \u2014 Attention here was drawn to a special map of the vicinity of Brussels, illustrating reservoir capacity. Japan exhibited about 100 coast island and harbor charts, one show ing particularly the light-houses, the product of the Hydrographic Office at Tokio.

Spain. \u2014 Worthy of close attention was the geologic map of the Pen insula, by Botella, and also his hypsometric map of Spain and pal\u00e6ographic studies; also a geological study of Saragossa, by Donayre. Germany. \u2014 Many new geological maps from the Institute at Berlin, articles from the Mining Society of Westphalia, the Bavarian Office of Mines, and from the Central Bavarian Meteorological Office attracted atten tion. Switzerland. \u2014 In this section was noticed the geologic map of Switz erland (scale 1:100,000), based on the general topographic map of Dufour, sixteen sheets of which had been issued by the Geological Commission, partly at private expense; also the labors of the Meteorological Institute, and the studies of the glaciers by the Alpine Club. Italy. \u2014 The several meteorological offices, and especially the central one at Rome, presented published evidence of their activity, and many new meteorological instruments were noticed. Belgium. \u2014 New geological charts were to be remarked by Andrew Dumont, chief of service of the Geological Map of Belgium. Japan. \u2014 An interesting collection of minerals, with works on zoology, botany, and arch\u00e6ology were noted, as well as the later publications of the Imperial Meteorological Institute.

Hungary. \u2014 Not less than two hundred and fifty articles were ex hibited, two-fifths of which were taken from the library of the National Museum, the remainder almost entirely from the private collection of Giova Mircse. Spain. \u2014 Notable were the finely executed atlas made for Philip II, the collection of mathematical instruments of Charles II, the plans of Goleta and Mazagniver, the reproduction of the celebrated chart of Juan de la Cosa, old charts of the Indies, and an ancient plan of the city of Madrid, and copy of the letter of Columbus, written from the Canary Isl ands February 15, 1493, announcing the discoveries of his first voyage. Germany. \u2014 Here were Curtius & Kiepert's Atlas of Athens and At tica; Kunstmann's Atlas relating to the discovery of America; two maps by a son of Columbus; also a curious collection of ancient astronomical and other instruments, by Mr. Heilbroner, of Munich. Switzerland. \u2014 This country presented a very complete collection of works, maps, and manuscripts relating to the ancient geography of Switz erland, classed chronologically, with a brief historical sketch given in the special Swiss catalogue. Italy. \u2014 Earlier geographical works were arranged chronologically, be ginning with the thirteenth century. There was an old astrolabe of the year 1216, instruments and diplomas from the relics of Marco Polo. The famous map of the world by Fra Mauro (1459) was exposed under glass, photographs of which appeared in the seventh class. There were also not less than from sixty to seventy portulanos, each finely and beautifully executed, the oldest with a date at Venice, 1318, and the most recent of 1615, showing the length of time (three centuries) that this method of representation was presumably in vogue. Egypt. \u2014 A few Arabic works and instruments were noticed, and a map of the world by Hadji Ahmed, 1559. Argentine Republic \u2014 There may be mentioned the work of Quesada on the history of Patagonia.

Sweden. \u2014 There was noticed an album of one hundred and fifty-two charts, representing Ostrogothia in the years 1635-37. Class VI.\u2014 Commercial and Statistical. This class was bountifully represented. Most of the principal countries with well organized statistical bureaus, a fully developed postal, telegraph, and railroad system, exhibited, with the exception of Germany, the Bava rian statistical office alone being present. The ministries of commerce, agriculture, interior and public works, posts and telegraphs of France made an extensive and interesting exhibit of wall maps, atlases, geographico-statis tical maps, charts, and reports. The Panama Canal Company, under De Lesseps, presented reports, maps, and models of this Isthmus route. The first sheets of a physico-statistical atlas of Chavanne of Austria, maps, plans, and reports relating to the St. Gothard Railroad from Switzerland, and the projected Simplon Railroad, and of the works of improvement of the Rhine, Rhone, and Jura Rivers.

Austria exhibited fine heliograph and photolithograph reproductions of military maps in colors for school uses, also hypsometric works, globes, illustrations of the advancement of geography. Switzerland had a system atic and choice exhibit, specially in relation to the dissemination of knowl edge, with fine relief models of Alpine mountain groups. Germany ex hibited atlases and maps, &c, from the establishments of Perthes, Reimer, and others, as well as the works of Petermann, Keipert, Berghaus, and others. Holland offered a very interesting expose\" of the various methods for the reproduction of maps, practiced at the Military Topographic Bureau at the Hague. Class VIII. \u2014 Explorations, &c. Holland was here represented bv results of the Sumatra Expeditions (1877-1879), the Arctic Expedition of the Pandora (1875, 1876), and the recent explorations in Borneo by Bock. Italy contributed D'Albertis' works in New Guinea, Beltrame's White Nile, and that of Giglioli on the voyage of the Magenta. Austria exhibited results by Holub in South Africa, and those of Klut schak, the companion of Schwatka, in the Arctic regions. France presented results of scientific explorations in Madagascar, by Grandidier, of Charnay in Mexico and Central America, Crevoux in South America, and those of Revoil in the Somali country. In the German division were found the works on China by Richthofen, Finsch's travels in Siberia, Schweinfurth's map of the Nile Valley and Of the Arabian desert, with drawing and sketches of plants, of race types, African and Asiatic. The Argentine Republic exhibited results of explorations by Zeballos in Arancania, by Moyano, Moreno, and Lista in Patagonia, and those of Olascoaga in the Rio Negro."], [76, "74 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. From Belgium there was exhibited a map showing graphically the routes of African scientific exploration, a map compiled under the auspices of the International African Committee under the presidency of the King. The above are but a few of the many new, rare, and interesting things shown in this last but not altogether least important class. There were a number of objects, that especially attracted attention, as for instance in the Indian Section the self-registering tide-gauge. This instrument consists of a cylinder five feet long, to which are at tached various wheels so arranged as to enable tides to be registered graph ically on the largest possible convenient scales. Tides of amplitudes as great as 5 feet are represented on the natural scale, up to 10 feet on the scale of one-half, and up to 40 feet on the scale of one-eighth. The apparatus is constructed by Mr. P. Adie, of London (price about 8450), after the modi fications of Capt. A. W. Baird, Royal Engineers. Similar instruments, each supplemented with a self -registering barom eter and anemometer, the latter also constructed by Mr. Adie, are in oper ation at fifteen ports on the Indian coast. The instruments are worthy a trial in the United States. There were exhibited in this section diagrams and description, of Roberts' tide-predicting machine (reprinted from the Engineer, December 19, 1879), which machine is constantly employed by Mr. Roberts at the Nautical Almanac Office at London, in the prediction of tides for Indian and other ports, thus saving a large outlay for numerical calculations. In this section was also shown a Y level, with reversible eye piece, designed by Mr. T. Gushing, inspector of scientific instruments, India Office, London, to facilitate the adjustments for collimation, and constructed by Cooke & Sons, instrument-makers, York, England, which instrument has lately been introduced in the Indian survey on trial. The base is made oh the \"Tribrach\" principle, having three arms or branches, radiating from a central boss, the latter forming also the socket, or fitting in which the vertical axis revolves, which it is believed permits of greater delicacy in leveling than any mounting on four screws. For the spider lines of the telescope are substituted fine lines, ruled on plane and parallel glass, drawn with special care and accuracy. The eye end is so constructed as to admit of reversion for testing the collimation adjustment and the object-glass"], [77, "EXHIBITION BY CLASSES. 75 and eye glass ends are interchangeable for either testing or adjusting the horizontality of the line of collimation, wherein lies the greater part of the improvement claimed. The object-glass has a large aperture compared with its focal length, admitting thereby an increased amount of light ; the base is wide and stable, and the level is sensitive to small angular displacements, while harmony of proportion has been maintained. One thing particularly noticeable in all the new triangulation instruments of precision was the substitution of small circles with micrometers for larger circles with verniers. Of the new in struments from the prominent makers none had circles of a greater diame ter than 12 inches. It is claimed that the adoption of smaller circles with higher reading power is admissible and without detriment to accuracy, be cause of the greater perfection now attained in graduation. There were noticed in the Austrian section various specimens of gutta percha cloth, linen and paper materials (the latter hemp) upon which to print maps for field and campaign purposes. The gutta-percha affords the greatest clearness for printing, and samples of exceeding supleness were among those displayed. This material is far more expensive than either linen or cotton, but does not present the durability of either, having, how ever, the advantage of impermeability. The hemp paper manufactured in Vienna by the Neusiedler Paper Company is well calculated for maps for field use in ordinary campaigns, and is much used in European armies. Linen has the advantage of great durability with fine surface for printing, but is expensive. The Indian section displayed maps printed on fine, bleached, Man chester cotton for field use, and it was claimed that they gave great satis faction in the field and in campaigning, while the cost of the material is little, especially as compared with linen of like texture and fineness. The following publication, repeatedly receiving additions (French sec tion), is mentioned as a valuable aid to the general student of geography : \"Provisional list of special Geographical Bibliographies\" (Liste provisoire de Bibliographies Geographiques Spe\"ciales), by James Jackson, archivist and librarian of the French Geographical Society, 184 Boulevard St. Ger main, 1881 (pamphlet 8\u00b0, pp. 340)."], [78, "76 Ill -GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. (origin, organization, administration, eunctions, history, and progress.) LAND SURVEYS. INTRODUCTORY. The present century has witnessed the gradual but steady develop ment in perfection and accuracy of detail of the several general topographic (mathematically based) surveys ofthe old world. Not content with infor mation gained upon the subject from publications examined at the Inter national Geographical Congress at Venice, a personal visit was made to the main Government topographic offices at Florence, Vienna, Berlin, Mu nich, Paris, Brussels, The Hague, and Southampton, and data were also obtained from other countries through correspondence. It has thus been pos sible to gather a somewhat practical view of the origin, organization, ad ministration, functions, and progress of these great topographic works, together with glimpses at their history, parts of which are deemed of inter est. Incidentally information was obtained in regard to the allied features of the hydrographic surveys and geologic examinations of the various civ ilized countries. The principal surveys of the several civilized Governments that, ii < con sequence of the magnitude and variety of the interests involved, assume an extent, and demand a minuteness and accuracy seldom required by communities or individuals, are divisible into three classes : (1) Topographic. (2) Hydrographic or marine. (3) Cadastral or revenue. The first become Geographical surveys when sufficiently extended and fundamentally based upon initial astronomic points with a trigonometric extension and when accompanied also by examinations in the physical geo graphy branches of mineralogy, geology, and natural history."], [79, "77 INTRODUCTORY. The name defines the second The third, applicable to revenre purposes in older and thickly settled countries, and to land sub-divisions for settlement in newer countries, are simply planimetric. The surveys, necessary for great engineering opera tions, are naturally the outgrowth of the constructions demanded, being a proper function alone of the engineer in charge. There are derived, especially from the first two, maps of given areas, which possess when produced by Governments, as compared with those made by private means, a truthfulness and accuracy, which either are or ought to be above suspicion, resulting from a general and not a special survey. A more extended memoir on the subject of surveys in general, hereafter to appear in Vol. I, Geographical Report, quarto, will embrace (1) the measure (being the grade or class, with administration for and regulations of, also plans and estimates, annual projects, field and office methods, things touched upon only under \"Functions\" herewith), (2) the men (re ferred to in \" Organization,\") and (3) the results (limited by time, cost, and practical wants, shown herein under \" Progress.\") All of these works in Europe are based upon and held subsidiary to large and permanent Governmental wants, or as an aid to specified industries. The statements here presented, however, refer only to the general and certain technical features of these works, while it is hoped at some not very distant day that a brief paper can be prepared on the professional methods and processes of all trigonometric and topographic surveys of the higher order upon land, selecting the types found most satisfactory in practice. The gen eral Governments (monarchical in form) have had, and have usually exer cised, the authority to impose a direct tax upon land. For the convenience of this levy the Government has found the necessity of making measure ments of all tracts in accordance with the mode of occupation, so as to show every manner of ground property, thus aiding in the actual and equable assessment and distribution of taxation. The outgrowth of such a require ment has been the cadastral or revenue surveys, which in most cases have been simply planimetric and in advance of a more general survey based on topographic considerations, although in the instance of Great Britain the full and complete cadastral survey has been established last."], [80, "78 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. It is found that MM. Delambre and La Place, members of a French commission, recommended a cadastral survey of France in the year 1804, upon the scale of 1 : 2,500, which was adopted and ordered by Napoleon I, but this work proceeded without a trigonometric basis, as has been the case with most of the cadastral surveys except that of England. The meaning of the term \"cadastre,\" as defined in the \"Recueil des lois et instructions sur les contributions directes,\" is \"a plan from which the area of land may be computed and from which its revenue may be valued.\" The necessity for general topographic maps showing reliefs, although recognized at an earlier day, seems first to have been prominently developed in Europe, following the wars of Napoleon, and partly, too, through his per sonal influence, who, himself a student of maps, fully comprehended their practical utility, having been also for eleven months of his career (from De cember, 1794, to October, 1795), a member of the topographic service of the War Department of France; while the military map of South Germany was actually begun during the French occupation of 1801. General topographic maps (an indispensable auxiliary to the operations of an army) have increased in their accuracy, detail, and uniformity step by step with the science of modern warfare until now all the European states, except Greece, Turkey, and the little principalities and kingdoms bordering therefrom in the direction of Austria and Russia, are rapidly pushing to completion topographic sur veys of great detail as to field operations, and are publishing maps therefrom (both general and special) highly elaborate, and most useful to all branches of the Government and the public, expending large sums of money, and looking forward to almost constant revision, after the systematic detailed surveys shall have been completed, and thus the several great Govern ments contribute the basis of the complete geography of that part of the globe occupied and controlled by civilization. The grand general topographic survey, upon wliich these maps de pend, is principally made up of three parts, viz: the triangulation, the topography, and the cartography. The main or primary triangulation rests on bases measured with the highest attainable accuracy, the origin of the geographical co-ordinates of which depend on initial astronomical de terminations of the first or highest order of value ; from these datum points"], [81, "79 INTRODUCTORY. as loci, a network of triangles is developed, with sides varying from 10 to 100 miles in length. The latitude and longitude, at least of one vertex, and the azimuth of one side of each triangle is then determined with the greatest care and precision. The primary triangulation forms the frame-work of a lesser or second ary triangulation, from which the area is always subdivided by a tertiary triangulation. In extreme cases a further triangulation of the fourth and fifth order has been made. The points thus determined become the initial stations of the topogra- pher. Except in England and France the topographic field-notes have, as a rule, been laid down on the plane table. This method, by far the most effective for the delineation of all natural features, must be supplemented by theodolite and stadia work, and direct lineal measurements and offsets, when multiple detail is required. The combination of the two (plane-table sketching and direct measurements) with a thorough system of ordinary or trigonometric leveling, leaves but little, if anything, to be desired in the mechanism by wliich the position and relief of all necessary points shall be determined and graphically recorded. The leveling (both by ordinary or trigonometric process) of all the above-mentioned points and as many others as has proved necessary has proceeded from independent datum planes at a number of sea-level stations. It has been stated that one experienced topographer, with two or more soldiers, in Austria, during the summer season (approximating 5\u00a3 months), can survey 300 to 500 square kilometers (about 1 square mile per day) on the scale 1:25,000 and 150 to 230 square kilometers (approximating one half square mile per day) at scale 1:12,500, delineating the same in ink or colors during the winter. In Germany one topographer is said to complete in the same interval about 145 square kilometers (approximating one-third square mile per day) on scale 1:25,000. Schiavoni states, in his \"Principii de Geodesica,\" that one topographer can complete about 80 square kilo meters (approximating one-fifth square mile per day) in six months, on the scale of 1:20,000."], [82, "80 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. This latter difference may possibly be explained partly by difference in scale, but principally from the character of the ground and facility of communication over it. The number of computed triangulation points of the second, third, fourth, and fifth order varies greatly. In Germany, including the fourth order, there are 22 to 34 such points for each plane table-sheet (approximating 55 square miles). The original field-notes or plane-table sheets of the topographer, super vised and inspected by competent officers in the field, go to the hands of the cartographer, by whom under rigorous official supervision and inspec tion, they are reproduced on the same or a reduced scale for publication. These mathematically based topographic surveys extended, as they are to embrace large areas, where surface curvature is taken into account, become geographical surveys of the highest order of perfection yet reached, forming when properly done the mathematical frame-work for all geography. The cadastral survey usually, depending on a planimetric base and lineal meas urements while extended also to embrace large areas, employs only a simple net-work of lines bounding properties. It is at present the fashion among a certain class of scientific officials (specialists) in the United States to apply the name \" geodetic survey\" to a simple net of measured triangles with allied astronomic determinations, embracing also, accurately determined altitudes, while another class is attempting to appropriate all remaining scientific functions of Government Land Surveys, to the single and comparatively narrow use of the geologist. The application of the word \"geodetic\" as denominating a species of survey is a mis-use and without due significance, since it imparts no fit definition of the object intended, while the use of the word \" survey\" to distinguish the examinations made in geology and allied scientific branches is inappropriate, in that it confounds the results of theoretical investiga tions, with the mathematically determined facts and measurements usually and properly comprehended as a survey. It will be seen that the first and most useful function of geodesy is as the triangulation factor of a topographic survey, then when a requisite pre liminary knowledge is thus had, to extend its purpose as an adjunct to the"], [83, "INTRODUCTORY. 81 classes of observations necessary for the most accurate possible measure ments of the figure of the earth, while it has finally to be admitted that the work of detailed geologic examinations cannot properly begin until the topographic map is prepared for use as an index or graphic field note-book. The topographic survey lies at the foundation of all that constitutes finally an exact knowledge of physical geography, and no such survey is complete until all the natural and artificial features are mathematically measured, recorded, and delineated, the configuration being shown by equidistant rigidly accurate contours at intervals suited to all requirements. These requirements are properly dictated by the results demanded, as well as by time and cost, since the latter, were the contours carried for instance to the greatest precision demanded by military engineers >n the studies for construction of permanent fortifications, and made applicable to the entire area of any given country, might readily be made to cost more than the value of all the land and other wealth found therein. Reproduction is by hand or mechanical engraving on stone, zinc, or copper. Hand engraving, especially on copper, is a long and costly process (reaching as high as $45 per square inch for hill work), and has been re placed by photographic transfer \u2014 i. e., photolithography when the receiv ing and printing surface is stone, photo-zincography when zinc is used, and heliogravure for copper. The latter has been brought to a high state of perfection in Austria, and is used also for reproducing military topographic maps in Italy and Russia, Various means, chemical and otherwise, are now being attempted, with more or less success, for obtaining, with the greatest directness and clearness, transfers of specially skillfully delineated originals, to surfaces of zinc and copper. Chromo-lithographed maps are much employed in Continental Europe, as, for example, the new military map of France, 1 : 50,000, also French war department maps of scales 1:800,000, 1:500,000, 1:400,000, 1:200,000, and 1:100,000; military maps of Holland, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 (Eckstein process); map of Italy, 1 : 100,000 ; the new map of Spain, 1 : 50,000, &c. The great advantage of colors in reading maps is fully recognized in Europe, especially by the military profession, but the technical difficulties 1366 wh 6"], [84, "82 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. so far surrounding the reproduction still render it impracticable for general use on account of expense These are gradually being obviated, and the process Eckstein, herein described, overcomes more than any other the difficulties. The methods of photogravure on stone, zinc, or by gelatine film, are largely availed of by Governments when assuming offensive military operations. The orography (topographic relief) has been delineated in many ways, notably by hachures, after the Lehman method (full straight line hachures normal to the adjacent contour of least level and of thickness corresponding to the slope) or the modification by General Muffling (broken and sometimes waving in place of straight lines) ; also by contours at fixed intervals, or by a combination of hachures and contours. Unlike the engineer's contour, brought to the perfection of a minute and exact survey, required alone for sites for fortifications, &c, those employed for map purposes are more or less conjectural, dependent upon the degree of accuracy of the leveling and the frequency of the established points on each contour. Particularly conjectural are those that have been employed in mountain topography, where details have necessarily been obtained by sketching. Hypsometric maps in colors (Hauslab's method) have also been used to some extent, and for strategic purposes are exceedingly clear and valuable. Contours are employed to the exclusion of all other conventional meth ods of hill or mountain representation, alone, in the topographic maps of Spain, Belgium, and Denmark; hachures alone are still adhered to entirely in Russia, Holland, Sweden, Portugal, India, and Dutch East Indies ; for Germany, scale 1 : 100,000; Austria, scale 1 : 75,000; France, scale 1 : 80,0u0; Switzerland, scale 1 : 100,000 ; and a combination of hachures and contours, France, scale 1 : 50,000 ; Italy, 1 : 100,000, 1 : 50,000, and 1 : 25,000 ; Bava ria, 1 : i.5,000 ; Switzerland, 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 25,000 , contours, with oro graphy in tinted shading, for Norway, 1 : 100,000, and Saxony, 1 : 25,000; while editions both in contours and hachures are issued of the English maps, scales 1 : 63,360, 1 : 10,560, and Prussia, 1 : 25,000. Without exception, in all Europe, and wherever topographic surveys have been S3^stematically developed, the geologist avails himself of the topographic map as a base work, and preliminary to his investigations in"], [85, "INTRODUCTORY. 83 the field, and upon which to delineate and publish in colors his theoretical abstractions as to the several geological formations and their lines of demarcation, according to the classification and nomenclature in vogue in the several countries, but in no case, known to me, has the geologist had or exercised jurisdiction or control over the more important and fundamental operations upon which the trigonometric and topographic survey and its results are based. Nor does the geologist exercise any control even in con nection with the mathematical construction of the detailed map, the func tions of which, as will be seen, are dominated by broad and general requirements pertaining to one of the highest duties of government, the country's defense. When once the natural features, with all means of com munication, are determined, this map can be developed in economic suc cession to meet all industrial wants, national, state, municipal, and indi vidual, and it cannot be confined to the comparatively narrow requirements of special branches of science. These topographic maps are found indispensable, not alone to the war departments of the several Governments for all general as well as special mili tary operations (strategic and otherwise), but of primal importance to other departments as well, especially those organized to promote the industries of agriculture, commerce, and mining; to those engaged in public works of inte rior improvement relating to means of communication, flow of waters, estab lishment and perpetuation of harbors (in their conception and study), thereby, as in other like cases, saving long and expensive researches; in the decision of claims; in selecting areas for cultivation; also in works of irrigation; arte rial drainage of marsh and swamp lands, as well as in prevention of inun dation, and also as aids to artesian boring and in the management of forests; they are useful also in illustrating the economic classification of the soil; for the recording of general geological investigations, including the several formations and the distribution of extinct as well as living fauna and flora; as an aid in the study of meteorological phenomena and in scientific re searches generally; as preliminaries to the projection of railways, canals, and other lines of communication; to the hydrographic surveyor in his field of operations ; in the establishment and marking of post routes, com pleted railroads, canals, and telegraph lines, as well as reservations, admin istrative and other boundaries; also for the enlightenment of justice; the"], [86, "84 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. elucidation of questions of history, ancient geography, ethnology, or arch\u00e6 ology; in international treaties, cessions of territory, and rectifications of frontiers. In Europe, especially, the map, prepared in advance, or paripassu, as a preliminary to any of the above undertakings, is considered almost a sine qua non. In addition to governmental uses, those for municipal and educational purposes, and by the people generally, are too numerous for mention here. The principal Government maps now in use can be classified under the heads of (1) topographic, (2) economic, (3) cadastral. Since the vertical element of the topographic survey has reached a greater degree of refinement, the map has frequently been designated as orographic, chorographic, or hypsometric. The economic maps are severally known as those for land classification, agricultural, statistics, post routes, drainage, forestry, sanitary purposes, railways, telegraphs, interior communi cations and navigation, river and harbor improvements, national roads, ports, for recording geologic, mineralogie, and meteorologic results, &c. The above (except engineering maps) are all based upon the original or mother topographic map, with or without the orography, and varying in amount of detail. There are also special engineering, magnetic, natural history, ethno graphic, arch\u00e6ologic, historic, boundary and outline or planimetric maps (generalized), the latter usually on a small scale. By far the most important or paramount use to which the topographic map has been applied is naturally that for military purposes (in fact in this connection the terms military and topographic are synonymous), since a military establishment, with its varied functions, is necessary to every Gov ernment for the full and final protection of its citizens, and the defense of its soil with the structures and improvements thereon, and the first necessity of the strategist is a thorough knowledge of the physical conformation, the ob stacles and resources of a country in which operations are to be conducted, and no military commander has ever in advance, thoroughly and success fully planned a campaign, or properly carried on the operations thereupon consequent, or conducted armies in advance or retreat, protected lines of communication and the forwarding of supplies, or has grasped the situation"], [87, "INTRODUCTORY. 85 as a whole in the numerous details required by the advanced state of mili tary science and art, except by a thorough and free use of a full supply of accurate topographic maps, upon which are delineated all the natural and economic or artificial features, and of the means of transit over the territory to be protected or the region embraced within the scope of the military ope rations. Other than the topographic maps of every scale, used by the war serv ice of Governments, are special maps for military uses, as of passes and positions, camps, garrisons or posts, man\u0153u ver grounds, for tactics, war, and fortification studies, of fortified, halting and camping places, and itineraries, prepared and published generally on scales from 1:500 to 1:12,500. Most of the above are held alone for confidential Government uses.. On examination of the detailed topographic maps that have been pub lished in Europe alone (both general, special, and miscellaneous), it is found that there has been used, either by names, abbreviations, or conventional signs, a distinction between 1,148 delineated objects (natural or artificial) ; of these 140 refer to natural features, 331 to commerce and means of commu nication (natural or improved), 71 to agriculture, 65 to manufacturing, 18 to mining, 53 to purely technical, and 65 to special military purposes, as commands, stations, depots, fortifications, working defenses, &c, and 142 are miscellaneous. All of these without exception, upon scales (large and small) depend ent upon either a study of actual theaters of war, or approaches thereto or intercommunication, are a true requirement of the strategist and commander, and thus very properly through the centuries, topography has grown up a permanent unvarying essential of the military profession, than whom none other is ever to have the same need for the knowledge thus recorded, while unremitting vigilance is necessary to its protection from spoliation at the hand of such filibusters, as may, under the flag of the sister sciences, march forth to the subjugation of this, in common with all other scientific knowledge, in order that it may be finally prostituted to their sole ambitious aims. As an aid in strategical movements, the forward manceuvers of the Prussians during their entrance into France, and in their methodical march on Paris, in the late Franco-Prussian war, was an apt illustration of the"], [88, "86 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. precision and dispatch (counting to the hour) with which large bodies of troops may be disposed and handled over a \"terrain,\" known in advance in minute detail and faithfully shown upon the map. Much of this very detail (of later or current date) had been secured by German topographers prior to commencement of hostilities, and it may be safely asserted that the Ger mans were to some extent able to organize their aggressive movements with more certainty of success because of their intimate knowledge of French territory, and since also this information had been placed graphically in the possession of field and other officers, and in the hands of non-commissioned officers even, in forms suited to all requirements. The above are but some of the most apparent uses to which Govern ments put the record found on the topographic map; there are others con nected with statistics and special subjects of constant occurrence, while the public at large find these maps valuable when sufficiently detailed (as they are in Europe) in many of the daily avocations of life. Thus maps show ing the detailed configuration of all the natural features of the ground, and the constructions and improvements made thereupon by man, are alike useful to peace in its manifold functions, and as a conservative prerequisite to war in its operations, offensive and defensive. As long ago as 1768, when the representatives of the provinces of Hungary protested to Emperor Joseph II against a survey of their country, they were met by the reply, \"To govern a country well, it is necessary to know it well.\" In Europe the possession of good maps has now become of recognized importance to the citizen, be he a professional, manufacturer, agriculturist, or merchant, as well as to the soldier or Government, while their use to all classes of the public increases with each decade. If the detail is carried to that required for revenue purposes (as for instance to the scale of 1 : 2,500 employed in England), the whole based on the trigonometric points needed for the topographic survey, the added uses of the map are for purposes of registration, valuation, and transfer of land. In addition to the general topographic and cadastral survey, special surveys are required for the sites of fortifications and vicinities, defensive field-works, and other Government constructions, upon which to base all"], [89, "ORIGIN. 87 works for drainage and improvements in cities and large towns (the latter cared for by the general governments in Europe) ; and especially in the United States, and the colonies of Great Britain, the land-parcelling surveys, as an aid in securing and perfecting title. The scope of this report will not extend beyond the (1) topographic, (2) hydrographic, (3) geologic works of a general character with a reference simply to the cadastral and incidentally the more special surveys executed by the Governments. ORIGIN. The land operations herein enumerated are the great general topo graphic or mother surveys of the country from whence maps for military and industrial purposes have directly been constructed or compiled, or for scientific uses, as those upon which colors have been superposed, to show formations as in geology and the distribution of various other subjects in natural history, &c. By long use or custom in the above connection the words \"topographic\" and \"military\" have become practically synonymous. The terms \"geodetic survey,\" lately coined by specialists in the United States, do not appear in any of the European works, nor would they be appropriate, since if each kind of mechanism, method or system, invented or employed to determine the relative position of various classes of inor ganic forms were to be designated a \"survey,\" there would finally be as many surveys of a given area as there were_ kinds of examinations, inves tigations, or reseaches (of which the number is becoming legion), and we should then have independent of the topographic survey (the only one fullv defining the relief of the land and the hydrographic, of like functions for the ocean bed and that of navigable waters), at least the following sep arate kinds of surveys, .. e., geodetic, trigonometric, hypsometric, meteoro logie, magnetic, gravimetric, geognostic, geologic, mineralogie, zoologic, botanic, ethnologic, arch\u00e6ologic, &c. The measurements of arcs and chains of primary triangulation with determinations of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths, and initial astronomi cally established points, with also hj-psometric work, made with the great est attainable accuracy, for older and more thickly settled regions, are a prerequisite to a topographic survey of the first order of value, and such"], [90, "88 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. further observations as refer to gravity, atmospheric refraction, magnetic intensity, new star determinations, plumb-line deflections (constituting special features of geodesy), while manifestly of the highest scientific inter est, are not in Europe allowed such jurisdiction as to interfere in the slightest with the uniform and vigorous prosecution of the measure in hand (the topographic survey); no more than the deep-sea soundings, tidal or other physical observations prevent the early completion of the detailed systematic hydrographic survey. The above definition is made to prevent any ambiguity as to what is com prehended by the \" land and marine surveys\" of the principal Governments. In England the great general or topographic survey may be said to have commenced with the measurement of the Hounslow Heath base, under General Roy, Royal Military Engineers, in 1784, the triangulation for the (military) topographic map dating from 1791. Prior to the organization of the several German states into the present Empire the general land or topographic surveys were prosecuted independ ently. In Prussia, prior to 1816, there existed only the desultory works of a few administrative departments of the Government and individuals, at which date these map works were transferred from the Statistical Bureau of the Finance Department to the General Staff of the army, where they have since remained. In 1864 the more systematic topographic survey of the six Eastern provinces of Prussia was established, and in 1870, the new general map, scale 1:100,000 \u2014 674 sheets \u2014 was projected. Triangulation was begun in 1781, followed by detailed topography in 1785. The oldest MS. map found mentioned of Saxony dates from 1531. The survey of the country was first encouraged by August, the Elector, and conducted by members of the Oder family, from 1550-1600, publica tions therefrom being prevented. The first map seems to have been printed in 1568, and to have been used with revisions for over 200 years. The Aventine map of Upper and Lower Bavaria, 1523, that by Apian, 1536, are the first known, and were used for over 200 years. The first Bavarian atlas was projected by Bonne (iu 1801), an officer ofthe French General Staff (Etat-Major), detached for this purpose. The General Staff of"], [91, "89 ORIGIN. the Bavarian army has systematized and prosecuted this work without inter mission since 1817. The first known map of Wurtemberg is, one by Stoffler (1452, unpub lished), which was accidentally burned in 1534. The oldestknown published map was issued at Tubingen in 1559. The first trigonometric observations began in 1793. Systematic triangulation dates from 1818. Trigonometric and topographic works in Baden began in 1812-14, under Colonel Tulla, chief of the corps of military engineers. The earliest known atlas of the Austrian domain consists of eleven wood cuts^dated 1561. Tbe oldest geometric maps of Austria date from the seventeenth century. Triangulation began in 1762. The military Topographic Bureau of France dates from 1688, and has been in continuous existence ever since. The Dufour military survey of Switzerland commenced in 1830. Astronomic and trigonometric observations for a general topographic map of Holland were begun in 1802 by General Krayenhoff, inspector general of fortifications and of the corps of engineers. Triangulation seems to have begun in Spain in 1855. In Italy, prior to the consolidation in 1861, the Italian state Govern ments prosecuted separate surveys dating from about 1815. Austria con trolled in the northern part of Ital) till 1866. The first map of Sweden appears to have been executed in 1539, and the first engraved map in 1626. Surveys of different grades have beeu going on for over 200 years. The first complete map was issued about the year 1800. The oldest known triangulation began in 1758. A map ofthe Inlet of Ide, in Norway (scale approximately 1 : 50,000), appeared in 1661. A description of parishes was begun in 1706, and a general map of Norway appeared in 1761. The military topographic survey was ordered in 1773. The oldest geographical knowledge of Russia, consisting of descriptions of real estate by the fiscal agents of the Mongolian occupation, dates from the middle of the thirteenth century. The first general map of Russian territory, now lost, was made about the middle of the sixteenth century and called \"The Great Drawing.\" A"], [92, "90 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. printed map of Russia, published 1614 at Amsterdam, with Latin inscription, is found in the scientific military archives of the General Staff Bureau at St. Petersburg. Peter the Great was the first to fully realize the necessity of an accurate geographical knowledge of the Empire. He ordered the exe cution of surveys, preparation of maps, description of territory by districts in 1720, and made it part of the duties of the office of the quartermaster general to collect all needful information in regard to military topography and roads over which to move armies. Triangulation scientifically con ducted began in 1816 in Russia. The trigonometric operations for a topographic survey of Belgium date from 1844. The oldest noted map of Denmark bears date of 1550; another one was issued between 1638 and 1652. Triangulation commenced in 1762. The organized military survey dates from 1809. Geographic works have long been fostered by the Government of Portugal, and topographic works resting on a trigonometric basis were begun at the close of the eighteenth century. Surveys on the coast of what is now called British India began about 1600. The first map mentioned is the one by D'Anville in 1754 Route surveys began in 1763. Triangulation was introduced about 1800 Instrumental topography may be said first to have been undertaken for the Government of the United States shortly after the Louisiana pur chase by the expedition of the army officers, Lewis and Clarke, from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, set on foot by President Jefferson (the importance of the exploration of this territory having been appreciated by him, was brought forward as early as 1796 in the Philosophical Soci ety of Philadelphia, of which he was a member), and in pursuance of a specific confidential grant of money by Congress, the significance of which act is not likely to be overestimated in its influence toward the extension and acquisition of the broad continental belt now belonging to the United States.

The triangulation work required by this most systematic of surveys, is the first duty of the organization, and proceeds independently, although adopting, when convenient, any of the lately verified triangulation, con ducted by the Prussian members of the international commission for \"Eu- *The bureaus of mines and mining, and of the geological examination of Prussia, are not represented on this commission."], [96, "94 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. ropean degrees measurements,\" under General Bayer, a retired officer ot the General Staff, and formerly chief of the \" Landes-Aufnahme.\"* In Saxony the topographic work is carried on by the General Staff of the army, with a colonel of the General Staff (Etat-Major) in charge. In Bavaria the topographic survey has been conducted continuously by the Army General Staff since 1817. The present director has the rank of colonel. The Statistical Topographic Bureau of Wurtemberg, with a small topo graphic office at Stuttgart, consists of 1 director, 1 honorary, 9 ordinary, and 2 extraordinary members, with 17 assistants, with a civil head, only a small number of whom, under the direction of an army officer, are engaged on topography. A consultative commission, with delegates from the Ministries of Justice, the Interior, Education, and War, are superior functionaries of this bureau. The trigonometric and topographic works of Baden (with main office at Carlsruhe) are conducted by a lieutenant-colonel of the Prussian General Staff. In Austria-Hungary the present organization of the Military-Geograph ical Institute, a branch of the General Staff of the army, at Vienna, consisted in 1881 of 296 officers, 190 technical officials, and 300 non-commissioned officers, soldiers, and day workmen, 786 in all, with a major-general at its head. The military surveys in Austria during the last half of the eighteenth century were conducted under the quartermaster-general, and the land sur vey has been exclusively executed by officers of the army, who had also hitherto been detailed for geodetic operations. * The Great General Staff of the Prussian army, traces of which date hack as far as the Brandeu burg army under the great Elector, consisted, in 1875, of 147 officers of all grades, with 40 other officers attached for one year's duty. This body has had since 1821 an independent position, subject alone to the control of the commander-in-chief (uow the Emperor of Germany). General Field Marshal Count von Moltke has held the position of chief since October 29, 1857. Its duties are : the management of all questions concerning its personnel and arrangement of duties therefor, the continual development of military knowledge concerning both Germany and other countries, tho use of railways, the compilation of military history, the promotion of military science, maps, the great topographic survey of the country, <5_c. For strategic purposes there are three sections, to each of which are allotted a given number of countries, the duties of each of which are to attentively follow all military innovations at home and abroad, keeping informed of all matters concerning military organizations, reserves, the armament and equip ment of armies, the military geography of countries, the construction or removal of permanent fortifi cations, the development of railways, roads, canals, &c. The fourth section is that for railroads. Its special duty is to keep informed of everything that affects the subject of military transport, and to possess and maintain an accurate knowledge of all"], [97, "ORGANIZATION. 95 The following, taken from the year book of 1881, shows the divisions of the organization:* Group 1. \u2014 Direction of the institute.

J The Military Topographic Bureau of the War Department of France was established in Paris 1688, where it has since continuously existed. A corps known as \"Engineers of Camps and Armies\" was established in 1696, which was changed to the designation of \" Engineer Geographers of Camps and Armies\" in 1726, and to which a more stable status was given in 1744. In 1760 the engineer geographers were separated from the bureau of forti cations, and in 1761 consolidated with the \"de'pot des cartes et plans.\" By ordinance of 1776 the above body was associated in service with the Mili- railway systems both at home and abroad, together with their capacity for traffic, and to plan large military transport arrangements, &c The military history section has charge of the records aud the library. A geographic-statistical section is charged wrth the preparation of foreign military maps, and a special and independent branch has charge of everything connected with the great general survey. There is no army of Continental Europe without its general staff, engaged in specific duties and with a selected personnel drawn from the most able and meritorious officers of the army at large. (See \" The Duties of the General Staff, by Maj. Gen. Von Schellendorf,\" translated by W. A. H. Hare, Lieutenant of Eoyal Engineers, London, 1877.) * The total personnel of this institute in 1876 was 1,258. (See Comstock, \"Notes on European Surveys,\" p. 48.) There existed in Austria from 1851 to 1861, a specially selected corps of \" Military Engineer Geographers\" disbanded, however, upon the re-organization ofthe General Staff in 1861. tThis includes a military drawing school for selected officers and non commisioned officers. t The above establishment is a direct outgrowth of the \" Deposito della Guerra\" of the Cisalpine Republic, created at Milan about the year 1800, when a military topographic corps, called \"Engineer Geographers,\" was formed, to which were attached officers of the engineer corps (Corps du G6nie) of the Franco-Italian army. After the Austrian occupation of 1814 the above was continued under the name of \"Istituto Geographico Militare.\" This office was transferred in 1839 to Vienna and perpet uated substantially nuder its present form."], [98, "96 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. tary Engineers, and in 1777 the title of \"Military Geographical Engineers\" was conferred. In 1791 the functions of the latter were merged with those of the Military Engineers. A final reorganization was effected in 1799, with a special bureau directly under the First Consul. Topographic surveys were carried on by the \"Engineer Geographers\" until their disbandment in 1831, when they were taken up and carried to completeness by the \"Etat- Major.\" The name of the central office in Paris has been \"De'pdt de la Guerre,\" and for which the title \"Service Geographique\" has been given to the new surveys and revisions of the mother topographic map. The pres ent head of this branch of the service has the rank of colonel. The organization having charge of the topographic work in Switzer land is located at Berne, and is known as the \"Federal Topographic Bureau of the General Staff,\" with a colonel of Military Engineers in charge. It consisted in 1875 of engineers, engineer topographers, draughtsman, en gravers, lithographers, and printers, the number varying according to the means annually at disposal. In Holland a number of officers of the General Staff of the army, under the head of that bureau, conduct the topographic work in the field and pre pare the results for publication, while the Topographic Institute, with Mr Eckstein as director, under the same authority, has charge of the reproduc tion of all maps for the war and other ministries of the Government. The topographic office of the Dutch East Indies at Batavia is under the charge of a major of the army.* At this writing the personnel is unknown. The Geographic Statistical Institute at Madrid is under the charge of an officer of the Corps of Engineers (Field Marshal Ibanez,) who is assisted permanently and by detail by officers of Engineers, Artillery, and the General Staff, engineers of \" Ponts et Chausse'se,\" of Mines and of Waters and For ests, of Astronomers, a Corps of Topographical Engineers (officers and topo graphers), and geodetic aids. All military officers and civil engineers while employed on this duty receive extra compensation therefor. \u2022Colonel Versteeg, Royal Dutch Engineers (now retired), a delegate at Venice, was formerly in charge of this office."], [99, "ORGANIZATION. 97 At the same time the General Staff of the War Department of Spain is engaged in the preparation of maps, making reconnaissances, &c. The topographic works in Italy are carried on by the Military Geo graphic Institute at Florence, a branch of the General Staff of the army, but with power of independent action and self-control. It is composed of officers of the General Staff, Military Engineers, officers of Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry, technical and clerical assistants, and a number of selected enlisted men. The topographic section of the army General Staff has charge of the land surveys in Sweden. In 1806 the Swedish field surveying corps was established, embracing duties hitherto done by the Royal Fortification Corps and army at large, with a definite organization. In 1811 this branch was merged with the Fortification Corps under the name \" The Royal Engineer Corps,\" divided into the fortification and field survey brigade. The topo graphic part was separated and organized independently in 1831. Since January 1, 1874, the topographic corps has been dissolved and united with the reorganized General Staff with constitution as above. The summer field force of 1875 consisted of 28 persons. More detailed information will be found as this country is reached in the main text. The military geographical survey of Norway is conducted under the Geographical Institute at'Christiania, which resulted from merging the geo graphical survey of the interior department with the topographic section of the General Staff (Etat-Major). In 1828 the survey was named the \"Combined Topographic and Hydrographic Survey\" which became, in 1833, the \"Royal Norwegian Geographical Survey,\" which was again changed to that of \"Norwegian Geographical Institute \" (Norges geografiske Opmaaling), which was con solidated as above with the topographic section of the General Staff (Etat Major). Independent of members from the Staff officers of the army and navy are specially detailed for a period of service in the field and office.* The personnel is divided in the following sections, independent of an accounting branch: (1) Trigonometric-topographic section (its chief beiug a captain of the General Staff). * There has been lately established in Norway a commission, principally consultative, entitled the Geographical Commission of Norway, with the chief of the General Staff of the army as president, consisting of six members, military and civil. 1366 TO 7"], [100, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 98 (L>) Detailed surveys and map publications (chief, a captain of the General Staff). (.') H\\ drographie section (chief, a specially assigned naval officer). (4) Engraving and printing (cities, the lithographer ofthe General Stafl). (5) Photographic-galvunoplastic section (chief, the photographer of the Geueral Staff). The General Staff in Russia was organized in 1763, and route maps were prepared by its officers during the latter part of the eighteenth century. The imperial office of draughtsmen was created in 1796, and in I 797 converted into the imperial depot of charts. The collection of maps, hitherto in the engineer and quartermaster-general's departments, were transferred to this depot, which was officered by detail of superior and subaltern officers of Engineers and from the army, in charge of a major of the Engineer Corps. In 1812 the depot of charts became the military topographic depot, directly under the Minister of War, and was afterwards (in 1816) placed under the chief of the General Staff, the topographic section of which it still remains. In 1822 a corp of Topographical Engineers, unlimited as to numbers, to carry on systematic works, was established as a branch of the Imperial General. Staff, and a body of selected soldiers with a school for topographic instruc tion. This body was limited to 70 officers and 456 topographers in 1832, and the school received an entirely military organization. This corps was again re-organized in 1 866, the personnel being fixed at 6 generals, 33 superior officers, 156 subalterns, 170 topographers with civil rank, 236 topographers with rank of corporal, and 42 apprentices, making 643 in all. The Military Cartographic Institute of Belgium, at Brussels, a branch of the General Staff, was, in 1882, temporarily in charge of a major of the General Staff, its former head with the rank of colonel having lately deceased The topographical engineers are taken from the older pupils (subaltern offi cers) of the military school, 12 or 15 of these officers forming a brigade of the Etat-Major. The reproduction branch consists of draughtsmen, lithog raphers, engravers, photographers, and printers. The topographic section of the General Staff at Copenhagen has charge of the \" military geographic map \" of Denmark. The General Staff was established in 1808, and took charge of the above work in 18 JO, and to wliich all the map work hitherto in the hands of the Royal Scientific Society of Denmark, was transferred in 1843, where it has-"], [101, "ORGANIZATION. 99 since remained. The work is performed partly by officers of the General Staff and partly by other officers of the army detailed therefor. This office was reorganized and largely increased in 1867. In Portugal (unlike any other country) the trigonometric, topographic, hydrographic, and geological works are united under one direction, which was created in 1856. The bureau for this branch of service, at Lisbon, is divided into five classes of duties, as follows : (1) Geodetic (main triangulation, &c.) works. (2) Topographic works. (3) Hydrographic works. (4) Geologic works. (5) Artistic works and administration. The present great survey of India has resulted from the amalgamation (January 1, 1878) of the former organizations styled respectively trigono metric, topographic and revenue surveys under a single administrative and executive head, the surveyor-general, with a personnel in 1882 (accord ing to the \"India List\") of 44 military officers and 160 civil assistants. No organization for the prosecution of systematic general topographic surveys exists in the United States. The Geological Survey, organized by statute in 1879, for purely geological purposes, with the following words of an appropriation act as authority \"to continue the preparation of a Geolog ical Map of the United States,\" is carrying on topographic field operations at widely divergent localities in the older as well as the newer States, from a geologic standpoint, i. e., based on triangulation \" sufficiently correct \" only for the scale of the map employed, and with undue weight attached to the topographic relief of the natural features as compared with the details of communication and artificial and economic features of the ground. A partnership also exists between this work and certain States, wherein the topographic functions of this office of the General Government are, in a manner unknown, merged with like functions of the State. The Coast Sur vey has executed a narrow strip of topography along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coast lines, where its surveys are complete, usually to the first crest line within view of the nearest navigable channel of approach, and the same may be said, in a general way, of the Lake Survey of the great north ern lakes, as regards their lines of coast. By a special grant the Coast"], [102, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 100 Survey is carrying on triangulation near and along the thirty-ninth parallel to connect its trigonometric belts along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The Mississippi River Commission adds a strip of topography, includ ing the stream and its banks. Prior to the establishment of the Geological Survey various temporary organizations under the Interior Department had been operating at different times since the war of the rebellion in the regions west of the Mississippi River, known as the \"Geological and Geographical Survey of the Terri tories \" and of the \" Rocky Mountain Region,\" and the \"Geological Explor ation of the Black Hills,\" all controlled by the theoretical considerations of the geologist. The \"Geological Exploration of the 40th Parallel,\" under the Engineer Department, conducted its labors on a similar basis, while the \"Geographical Survey of the territory west of the 100th meridian,\" under the same Department, proceeded from almost a diametrically oppo site standpoint, giving due weight to the astronomic, geodetic, and topo graphic observations, with map delineations of all natural objects, means of communication, artificial and economic features, the geologic and natural history branches being treated as incidental to the main purpose. The above may be considered as the only organized, systematic, topographic work with a practical basis ever begun in the United States. Just as its organization (consisting of officers of Engineers, and of the Army, selected general-service and other enlisted men, civilian assistants, clerks, messengers, &c.) was brought to a high state of efficiency (through training and experience) by means, let us say, imperfectly comprehended, the appropriations were suspended. Geology in organic form was established in the Interior Department, the vastly more important work of topography was disregarded, and left unprovided for, and the services of practical and expe rienced Government Engineer officers thus lost for this latter duty, resulting in a direct and positive step backward, without precedent throughout the civ ilized world. It should be stated that commencing with the organization of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, March 3, 1813, organized more completely by act of July 5, 1838, and, until it was transferred to and consolidated with the present Corps of Engineers by act of March 3, 1863, that this"], [103, "101 ADMINISTRATION. body was charged with, among other duties, that of military topographical reconnaissance, exploration, and survey. Its functions in this particular at date of transfer consisted (independently of such duties as were germane to their service with armies in the field or at the several headquarters in times of peace) of the surveys for the planning and construction of works for the improvements of rivers and harbors ; the trigonometric, hydrographic, and topographic survey of the northern lakes ; the astronomical determina tion of boundaries and initial points ; the topographic surveys and recon naissances of the Interior, and of the Western Territory, &c, and these func tions still legally vest with the Engineer Department, excepting in so far as by acts of appropriation the expenditures of moneys for allied duties have been placed under other administration than the War Department. The subject of Government surveys is again before a Joint Commission of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, who have already taken 458 printed pages of testimony, most of which, however, refers only to the present Coast and Geologic Surveys. ADMINISTRATION. Out of the 20 systematic duly organized topographic works in exist ence, 14 (Prussia (Germany), Saxony, Bavaria, Austria-Hungary, France, Switzerland, Holland, Dutch East Indies, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Denmark) are now and always have been administered through the War Department. Six (the United Kingdom, Spain, India, Wurtem berg, Baden, and Portugal) are now found assigned to other departments ; but in every case, without exception, the work is executed under the direc tion of an army officer, selected from the Military Engineers or General Staff. In Spain and Portugal the administration has greatly varied, but in the principal European nations, it has had, since being under military admin istration, and early in the present century more particularly, a fixed and per manent tenure. In Great Britain the Ordnance Survey was administered by the War Department from its inception and origin until 1870, when the scientific trigonometric and topographic survey was completed and the cadastral survey well in hand. The work was then transferred to the Office of Works, with organization and personnel unchanged, for reasons inherent to the"], [104, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 102 policy of the budget, while its functions are semi-independent with powers of self-control. In Prussia, which has now the central direction of all the land surveys of Germany, the administration has been since 1816 under the War Ministry. In Saxony the War administration has always been charged with these works, and likewise for Bavaria since 1817. In Wurtemberg is found the Statistical Topographic Institute, under the Finance Department, the duties of which, other than -statistical, consist principally of map revision and furnishing a quota for the general topo graphic map of Germany. In Baden these duties are found under the Commerce branch, with an officer of the Prussian general staff in charge. Austria-Hungary has devolved these works continuously upon the War Ministry. In France the name topography is synonymous with War administra tion, which branch of Government has been specially held responsible for its conduct since 1688. Switzerland has also conducted all its topographic works under the War Department. The administration in Holland, as well as the topographic surveys in the Dutch East Indies, has been that of the War Department. In Spain, since 1870, the topographic works, largely carried on by army officers, are under the Geographical Statistical Institute, a branch of the Department of Public Works. Data regarding such works prior to 1870 are not at hand. At the same time special military surveys are carried on under the War Department by the General Staff of the army. Topographic works have always been under War administration in Italy. Ever since systematic topography has existed in Sweden, the opera tions have been confided to the War Department. In Norway, topographic work, formed by merging the geographical survey of the Interior De partment with the topographic section of the General Staff, rests with the War Department."], [105, "FUNCTIONS. 103 Since topographic operations have assumed an organic form in Russia their charge has been a part of the War administration. Topographic surveys in Belgium have always been in the War Depart ment. The general survey of Denmark, since its systematic organization in 1830, to which all such works by the Royal Scientific Society were trans ferred in 1843, has been under the War Department. The administration of topographic works in Portugal has undergone various changes in administration between the War and other departments, the topographic, hydrographic, and geologic branches now being under one executive head, and devolved upon the Ministry of Public Works. The great general survey of India, presided over by an officer of Mili tary Engineers, is now under the Department of Revenue and Agriculture. The administration of topographic surveys in the United States was imposed upon the War Department exclusively from the organization ofthe Government until 1869, when geological exploration parties of the Interior Department commenced a class of topographic operations, with resulting maps upon which to show the geology. Work in the War and Interior De partments continued to the year 1879, when the purely geological survey was formed and general topography as an integral quantity stricken from the list of things appropriated for by the Government.

The geographical service of Norway has charge of all the usual funda mental operations which such offices have been called upon to perform in Europe. Its principal works at present are: (1) All field and office work necessary for the principal topographic map of Norwaj^, 1:100,000, in 54 sheets. (2) The \"Amt\" map of Norway, scale 1:200,000, with large cities shown thereon at scales of 1 : 20,000. (3) General map of Norway, 1:400,000, and the necessary revisions and changes for all maps. Russia confides all its topographic work to the topographical section of the General Staff, which includes all the preliminary main linear and angular measurements for fixing the initial geographic co-ordinates upon which the detailed topography is based. The principal works now being prosecuted are: (1) The field and office work necessary to the construction and pub lication of the great map of Russia in Europe, scale 1 : 126,000, in 792 sheets, which includes the topographic map of Poland, 59 sheets, same scale."], [111, "FUNCTIONS. 109 (Original field minutes of the above are taken at the scales of 1 : 21,000 and 1 : 42,000, and it is believed are published in specified instances, but not yet as a whole.) (2) Topographic map of the Caucasus, scale 1:210,000, 77 sheets; topographic map of European Russia, scale 1:420,000, 154 sheets; topo graphic map of Asiatic Turkey, scale 1 : 840,000; topographic map of mili tary districts in Turkestan, scale 1 : 1,680,000; topographic map of Western Siberia, scale 1:210,000; map of Central Asia, scale 1:4,200,000; and various others, with all the changes and revisions currently required. Belgium carries on the astronomic, trigonometric, topographic, and cartographic works necessary for the resultant topographic map through its Military Cartographic Institute. Its principal works at present are : (1) Field and office operations necessary for construction of the topo graphic map of Belgium; scale 1 : 40,000, in 72 sheets. (Original field minutes at scales 1 : 10,000 and 1 : 20,000.) (2) The topographic map of Belgium, scale 1 : 20,000, in 430 sheets, now complete. (The publication of special plane-table sheets, scale 1 : 10,000, has also been begun.) (3) Various older maps. (See lists of maps.) (4) Current changes and revisions receive constant attention. In Denmark all the topographic duties devolve upon the single military organization constituted for that purpose. The main works at present are-: (1) The topographic map of Jutland, scale 1:40,000; in 131 sheets. (2) The same for the Islands, scale 1 : 80,000, in 29 sheets. (3) The field-minute sheets (construction and publication), scale 1 : 20,000 \u2014 646 sheets for Jutland and 409 sheets for the islands. (4) Topographic map of Zealand, scale 1 : 160,000. (5) The constant correction and revision of maps. Portugal carries on under one direction the following principal works on a trigonometric basis : (1) The principal topographic map of Portugal, scale 1 : 100,000, in 37 sheets."], [112, "110 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. (2) Chorographic maps of Portugal, scales 1 : 500,000 and 1 : 1,000,000; also maps of Lisbon, scales 1 : 8,000 and 1 : 10,000, with all needed revision work. The survey of India (topographic and revenue) is carried on under one direction, with principal work in progress as follows: (1) Field and office work necessary to the completion of the main topographic atlas of India, scale 1:255,561, in 177 sheets. (2) Plans of towns, military stations, forts, &c, scales 1:500, 1:2,640, &c. (3) Surveys of estates, military districts, presidencies, provinces frontiers, &c, scale 1:3,168 to 1:2,027,520. (4) Revenue surveys at scale of 1:15,840. (5) Various general charts on inconsiderable scales, together with all correction and revision work. There never having been defined by law a general topographic survey of the United States, all such works have but followed the specific mone)^ grants therefor. As has been stated, appropriations for the Geographical Surveys of the War Department have been dropped from the annual actsr and that Department for the time being but compiles and issues the best maps it is practicable to prepare with scanty funds. The Coast Survey continues as heretofore its narrow shore strip of topography of the land that first meets the eye of the navigator, while the survey of the Mississippi River Commission adds also its quota of topography. The Geological Sur vey is also producing such restricted topography upon which to base its general geologic map as the geologist may dictate, its kind having been here inbefore described. HISTORY. No history of the great undertakings that have led to the detailed topo graphic surveys and their results herein set forth can properly be written except at the Government offices, where the original records have been kept since the earliest days. The list of works mentioned later on gives a number of such publications for Russia, Sweden, Prussia, &c, like undertakings to which might usefully be followed by other countries. Cer tain meager historic facts will be found as the text of the several countries is reached."], [113, "PROGRESS AND COST. 111 PROGRESS. The summary tables and the lists of maps in the main afford a resume* of the progress in the several countries conducting systematic topographic works. It has been extremely difficult to obtain complete and reliable data of the cost of the topographic surveys This naturally varies greatly in accordance with the character of the country, whether plain or mountainous, or wooded, and the scale of the field data as well as the resultant map. The actual total cost of the Ord nance Survey of England from its first organization to December 31, 1881, as given by the officer in charge of accounts, was \u00a34,544,050 (estimating only for the years 1871 and 1872), or $22,725,250. The average cost per square mile to that date would have then been $186. On the assumption that the cadastral survey can be completed in 1890, and allowing the present annual cost up to that date, the then cost per square mile would be 8244. The result will then be a map on the scale of 1:2,500 for all England, the same for the cultivated parts of Scotland and the 6-inch scale for the uncultivated portions and the latter scale for Ireland entire. The above cost is independent of the regimental pay of officers and enlisted men, which has been estimated would cause an increase of about one-eighth. The average cost of the present plane-table survey of the German Empire (scale 1 : 25,000), as given at the Berlin office (byan officer deputed for that purpose), assuming two hundred German square miles as the annual amount, at a cost of 1,200,000 marks for field and office work, gives (approximately) $79 per square English statute mile. This sum is in addition to the cost of the earlier surveys, mostly on the 1:50,000 scale, for separate German states. The estimated cost of field and office work by the the Geographical Institute of Vienna (field plot 1:25,000) has been esti mated at about 1,000 florins, or, approximately, $400 per square geo graphical mile. The extremely detailed survey of the city of Bombay for municipal purposes of an area of twenty-two square miles and one hundred and forty-nine acres on the scale of one inch to one hundred feet for the city proper and one inch to forty feet for the suburbs was found to"], [114, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 112 cost at an average approximate rate of $7,040 per square mile. A reference to cost, more in detail, will be found, as each country is reached. The following list shows the number of countries now engaged, as far as can be learned, in the prosecution of complete and connected topographic surveys of their territory, with data concerning scales, names of works, &c. The following lists, taken from all available authoritative sources, show the principal Government maps and the actual number of general, special, and miscellaneous topographic maps and others, including cadastral and geologic, issued at the dates respectively stated: GENERAL TOPOGl.'APIllC MAPS.

There have been noted as employed on the topographic or base-work series of maps of Europe names, conventional signs, and abbreviations to the number approximately of 1,148, which may be divided as follows : (1) Those representing natural features, (2) pertaining to means of communication, (3) agriculture, (4) commerce, (5) manufactures, (6) mining, (7) miscella neous, (8) special military, (9) special technical, and (10) boundaries. Colors have been employed for representing more distinctly a number of objects from each of the above classes. The following, alphabetically arranged, are those for natural features \u2014 (1) land, (2) water, and (3) land and water combined: NATURAL FEATURES OF LAND. Alkaline flats, arable lands, alluvium, arid or barren, avalanches, basins, buttes, bushes, beaches, brushwood and rocks, bowlders, bars (river), bars (ocean), coast lines (high and low water), cliffs, crags, capes, copse, craters, canons, coverts, clays, caves, canon walls, chasms, defiles, drainage divides, deserts, dales, downs, detritus, deltas, depressions, dry meadows, exposed rocks, earthy banks, extinct volcanoes, furze, forests or woods (deciduous, coniferous, mixed, palm grove, mango grove), forests (wet or dry), fissures and cavities, gorges, glaciers, grottoes, grazing lands, glens, glades, grass, gravel pits, heaths, hills, hillocks, heath (high), heath (low), hidden rocks, islands, isolated hills, isthmuses, jungles, landslips, llanos and prairies, lime pits, mountain chains or ranges, mountains, mesas, mesa bluffs, moraines, moors (wet), moors (dry), meadows with bushes, meadows with hillocks mineral croppings of gold, silver, iron, copper, lead, zinc, tin, coal, salt, quicksilver, &c, marl pits, plains, plateaux or table lands, peaks, passes, prairies, pasturage, points, pastures with rocks, trees, peninsulas, precipices, places, polders, rocky and barren, ravines, river banks, reefs, summits, shingle, sand flats, sand dunes, sand hillocks, strands, shoals, saline flats, steppes, salt beds, savannahs, spurs, sand rifts, seaweed, steep rocky ground, steep earthy ground, sand beds, thickets, turf, underwood, valleys, volca noes, volcanic cones, velocity and direction of currents, willows.

NATURAL FEATURES, LAND AND WATER COMBINED Bogs, low bog, moss bog, mud lakes, marshes, morass with rushes and with reeds, peat bogs, puddles, pools, and holes, swamps, salt marshes, wet soil, &c. MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. After the natural features, the objects detailed information of which, reduced and shown in map form, is requisite for the military commander, are the means of communication, of which railroads, constantly increasing, are most important. It has been customary to show these on European topographic maps with conventional signs for the following details: Railway, whether single or double track, for passengers and freight, for freight alone, broad or narrow gauge, completed, in operation, in course of construction or projected; if undergoing construction, the present and prospective number of tracks. As well, there are shown embankments, tunnels, cuttings along and across line, culvert and other bridges on the line, of wood or stone, either con tinuous or open track; bridges, whether of masonry, iron, masonry and iron, wood, suspension, draw-bridges, with stone or wooden ends, with widths and uses stated; also viaducts, ordinary stations of the several classes, with or without water supply, watering stations, stopping places, and guard-houses; also bridges over and under the line, level, raised, and depressed crossings, whether fenced or unfenced, with ballasting of stone, gravel, or earth, ticket offices, turn-tables, section stations for construction, storage, and repair, and termini ; also street railways and other tramroads. The next in importance are navigable rivers, of which those with bridges, fords, ferries, and fish weirs are distinguished from those entirely unobstructed, with direction and velocity of currents; also navigable lakes, transportation and irrigation canals, the former with and without locks, lined and unfilled, with masonry, or wood, or earth, with draw, wooden, and stone bridges, and whether.completed, projected only, or in course of construction. The ordinary roads, often of great strategic importance, are mostly classified as when under Government control, or specified as turnpikes or"], [148, "142 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. main roads, (1) fenced, (2) unfenced; also municipal, village, cross, or coun try and local, permanent causeway, private and posting road, fenced and unfenced, both with or without trees; those inclosed by ditches or other ob stacles, with positions of embankments and cuttings, or of contracted widths, as completed, or in course of construction, with widths, with retaining or parapet walls; steep inclines where drag-shoes are required, or hollow ways, whether paved or metalled, with or without foundation, macadamized, graveled, rubbish, or shingle, with culverts; or stone bridges with drains, and wooden bridges ; also winter roads, post and caravan routes, stone, wooden, and earthen causeways, walled on one or two sides, and as with cul vert bridges, or embanked; earth or fascine ways, old Roman and other roads, poor a,nd impassable roads, through roads, field and heath country tracks, cattle passage, bridle and foot paths, easy and difficult paths for pack animals, (trail), hollow roads, lanes with hedges and culverts, alleys, avenues, streets, field or forest road and by-ways, toll-gates, and bars. In France the ordinary roads are classified into Government, depart mental, commune, local, and cross roads, either with or without trees, while in Italy there are four classes. In Sweden the country roads are divided into (1) canton or superior; (2) parish roads, good and bad; manor roads ; (3) roads for carriages or wagons, or narrow, for bridle or foot-paths ; streams, navigable, &c. There should not be omitted the usual ocean, sea, lake, and river means of communication, by steam and other boats and sailing ships and rafts. Other features commonly noted are fords for persons, horses, carriages, and pack trains ; ferrys for carriages and wagons, for horses, passengers; steam boat, steam ferry-boat, flying ferry-boat ; by wherry, boat ferry, with or without ropes, raft or skiff ferry, sailing boat, ferry and ferry bridge. Prominently noted have been Government or corporate telegraph lines or stations, and latterly the same for telephones. Bridges, with or without stone piers, besides being designated according to materials used, as iron, for sub- and superstructure, and specified as to width as to number of vehicles abreast, or as foot or bridle bridges, perma nent or temporary, stone, brick, wood, &c, are mentioned as follows : Fly ing, floating, raft, of boats, suspension, for carriage and as footways, pon-"], [149, "143 NAMES, CONVENTIONAL SIGNS, &C. ton, culvert, bridges for one and two wagons, draw- bridges, stone or wooden at extremities, and swinging bridges. Certain other features of lines of communication are noted, as passes, de files, ravines, gorges, summits, rocks, peaks, cliffs, fordable and unfordable brooks, torrents, and streams, bridgeways, heliographic and optical signal stations. The special objects that have been observed and located as specially belonging to agriculture are : Cultivation boundaries and limits, country towns, drains, farms, fences, groves of oranges, olives, lemons, &c, gardens (vegetable and others), hedges, orchards, plantations, rice-fields, sheep-folds, vineyards, woodland, &c. The more important delineated features relating to commerce are : Bonded warehouses, bazaars, breakwaters, buoys, banks, custom and light houses, cities, capitols, docks for merchantmen and mercantile harbors, grain elevators, hotels, jetties and dikes, market places, moles, piers, reservoirs, sea, river, and polder dams ; sea and land beacons and light-ships, sea quar ries, ripraps, &c. More strictly relating to manufactures are : Alum, cast-iron, copper, glass, salt, wire, and other works, coke ovens, cement diggings, dynamite factories, factories with steam or water power, foundries, mills, ship-yards, tanneries, &c. The principal among the various classes of mines are : Arsenic, alum, copper, coal, cadmium, cobalt, gold, iron, lead, lignite, mercury, pit coal, silver, salt, saltpeter, tin, vitriol, working mines, and others. Certain miscellaneous features making up the whole of the artificial objects of a given area are : Abbeys, chapels, churches, cathedrals, crosses, cloisters, cemeteries, chateaux, convents, cottages, court-houses, capitols, es tates, election districts, fountains, hermitages, mile-stones, observatories, obe lisks, quarantines, shrines, school-houses, universities, wells, water-pipes, &c. Independent of all the natural and artificial features required for per fect military maps, there are certain works and objects inherently needed on maps by this branch of the Government, such as arsenals, anchorage for war vessels, abattis, bastions, barriers, block-houses, camps, chevatix de frise, citadels, casemated works, drill-grounds, detached forts, docks for men of war, embankments, earthworks, entanglements, fortifications, fortresses,"], [150, "144 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. war, embankments, earthworks, entanglements, fortifications, fortresses, forts, fortified posts, gun-foundries, hospitals, halting and camping places, intrenchments, lunettes, loop-holed- inclosures, mud forts, magazines, ma nceuver grounds, navy-yards, neglected fortifications, obstacles, ponton bridges, palisading, pickets, patrols, redoubts, rifle-pits, retaining walls, sig nal stations, stone dams, stone galleries, stockades, towers, turrets, tor pedoes, trenches, traverses, vedettes, walled towers, position of troops, infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers, pioneers, sharpshooters, &c.

Boundaries regulated by the governmental and communal organiza tions peculiar to the several countries are noted as frontier, administra tive, ecclesiastic, military, judicial, municipal, &c. The colors employed to express certain natural and artificial topographic features are, with slight variations, blue (Prussian), red (vermilion and carmine), brown (burnt sienna and sepia), and green (in various shades). The varied water forms are usually expressed in blue, as rivers, lakes, ponds, creeks, brooks, seas, bays, canals for navigation and irrigation, ditches, marshes, reservoirs, &c. Red has been generally employed for artificial features, such as aque ducts, stone or iron bridges, stone buildings, towns, cities, fortified places, roads, and railways, &c, and to invite attention to objects especially ger mane to military operations or such as may be of technical importance."], [151, ""], [152, "r I"], [153, "EXTENT OF TOPOGEAPHIO SUEVETS. 145 Brown is used to denote contours, rocks, moraines, mud houses, village and country roads and paths, &c, and green, in various tints, for trees, woods, forests, meadows, fields, and feaures of cultivation in general. Mixed tints of gamboge, umber, and India ink washes are also used for a variety of objects. EXTENT OF DETAILED TOPOGRAPHIC SUEVEYS. A map of the world on a small scale (Mercator projection) is here in troduced to illustrate graphically the location and extent of topographically, instrumentally, and mathematically surveyed areas, where these works rest on a computed trigonometric basis. The information gathered shows that a little over 6,000,000 square miles have been so surveyed, or are under going such survey, or about one-ninth of the land portion of the globe, while the balance, or about eight-ninths, inhabited by over 900,000,000 of people, is comparatively poorly known, or, in part, a terra incognita from a true topographical standpoint. One of the results of modern civilization in its quest after habitable lands for their advantages to the multiple wants of man will naturally be, to gradually subject the temperate regions, at least, to the analysis of a minute topographical survey, the value of such data having already become so well fixed in the polity of the older civilized nations. The following lists show the distribution of areas \"undergoing\" and \"not undergoing\" systematic topographic surveys: Areas undergoing systematic instrumental , m athemaiical.

While an average cost per square mile of a topographic or other sur vey does not convey an absolutely accurate idea of intrinsic merit, yet as an approximate guide to Governments prosecuting or about to prosecute such. surveys over large areas, estimates of cost, upon the various scales, based upon actual expenditures, cannot but be of value. In most instances these are naturally difficult to obtain : first, because apparently the executive branches carrying on the works have not, as a rule, been called upon to compile the data; again, since in any one of these un dertakings from which has resulted a final, complete, and connected detailed topographic map of an entire state, the scale upon which the field min utes have been taken has often varied during the prosecution, as well as that of the published map ; of far more importance, however, is the varia tion due to configuration of ground and facility and means of communica tion over it. The official reports of the survey of India give certain details from actual expenditures concerning cost as follows : 1. For the general topographic survey (scale 1 inch to 1 mile) based upon the primary triangulation, an average (for 10 years) of approximately $11 per square mile. 2. For the village survey (scale 4 inches to 1 mile) based on main triangulation, au average (for 10 years) of $26.50 per square mile. 3. The cadastral survey (scale 16 inches to 1 mile) the average rate of $82 (ap proximately) per square mile, for a period of 15 years. To obtain the total cost in any of the above cases, to each must be added the cost cf the astronomical and principal triangulation work and that of leveling. The cost of the latter along main lines has been estimated- Continental divisions. Aiea not un- dergoing sur- vey. Population. Remarks. 1.

All the above estimates are based on actual expenditures and do not include the cost of the production of the printed map from the original drawing From an examination of the above list* it appears that most ofthe Eu ropean states will be possessed of complete detailed topographic maps of their respective territories from the scale of 1 :2,500 (as for England) to that of 1 : 126,000 for Russia, before or at the close of the present century, the principal triangulations having been in the main completed for a number of years. The above are mostly works of colossal proportions, such as can be executed alone by the concentrated force of a prosperous Government, holding primarily in view the necessities for public defense, and incident ally the requirements of all branches of the public service. Up to the year 1857, most of the map results were held a secret and kept entirely within the custody of the Government ; now, however, with scarcely an exception, the resultant atlas sheets can be purchased, far and wide, at a most reason able cost. In time of war, naturally, these sales are stopped within the home country, and all the map material held confidentially by the Government within the war ministry archives, for none other than war purposes. The topographic relief of the above list of chart series has been shown in several ways, as, for instance, by (1) lines drawn normal to the horizontal curves (called hachures) in number and thickness, according to the slope, with vertical light; (2) similar lines, irregularly drawn, and illu minated diagonally ; (3) by hachures and curves combined ; (4) by tinted mountain shading and curves; (5) by contours principally, and hatched lines near mountain summits (as in the Swiss maps); and (6) by horizontal curves alone, as, notably, in the Spanish maps. * See pp. 112 et seq."], [156, "148 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Each of these conventional methods has its champions, there being a \u00ab leaning toward contours, where the accuracy of the field-work justifies. Doubtless a practical combination of curves and hachures, the latter for impracticable slopes (of an inclination greater than 45\u00b0), with the curves for the balance of the area, will at some time prevail. The method of graphic illustration of all generalized maps, by engrav ing on stone, copper, and zinc surfaces, has gradually been superseded by processes for the greater part mechanical (the camera being introduced to perform principally the labor of transfer), and designated as photolithog raphy, photozincography, heliogravure (developed to a high state of per fection at the Military Institute, Vienna), anastatic, photo-chromolithog raphy, &c. A skeleton description of certain of these processes will be found later, in which it appears that the saving in time and expense is very great, there being a loss only in clearness of detail and brilliancy of execution. Independent of the general European chart series, each covering the area of a single country, may be noted the Reymann chart of Central Europe being produced at the Berlin office of the Etat Major (see foot-note) in 462 sheets (copper engraved), scale 1:200,000; also a chart being published at the Imperial Royal Military Geographical Institute at Vienna (scale 1:300,000) covering first Austria-Hungary, then to be expanded over Central and Western Europe; a map of France (1:200,000), lately commenced, covering areas of countries adjacent to its frontiers and a part of England, and still another general map of Russia, overlapping to the west and south, on the scale of 1:420,000.

There is a Hydrographic Office iii the naval estab lishment of the United States, but its sphere is restricted in the main to office duties, reconnaissances of foreign coasts, and the publication of maps, while the systematic hydrographic survey of the ocean and Gulf coasts of the United States has been carried on by the United States Coast Survey, by law a military and naval organization, with a civilian superintendent and civilians attached, in fact, at present, a civilian organization with naval officers attached, and found within the administration of the Treasury Department. The geological investigation in Portugal directed by an officer of Military Engineers, forms a section of the office of geodetic and topographic works, and in Wurtemburg, under the topographic branch, directed b}T an officer of the army, it is found connected with the Statistical-Topographic Bureau. These examinations and investigations usually embrace the branches of mineralogy and paleontology, with chemical and microscopic analyses, and are either general in their character, locating and defining the rock and other formations, by means of surface examinations and those made in mines, or by boring and cross-sections, using the topographic map as a basis upon which to illustrate the former, with colored sections added, and in some cases investigating the dynamic forces, past or present, in relation to the development and present condition of the earth's crust, or economic, as in examining for the causes surrounding the presence of the valuable mineral constituents, found in rocks and soils and in analyzing soils and pointing out their relative values for specified purposes."], [158, "150 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The resultant geologic map which appears to be one of the most im portant practical objects and results of such an examination, while exceed ingly valuable for the student of geology and the miner, is less useful to the world at large and the Governments more especially, than the purely topographic map upon which the colors are superposed, the latter and the special geologic signs tending somewhat to confuse the topographic detail proper. In other words, the topographic or mother map of a country is the Oue that all the world may use, while the geologic edition of the same, is limi ted in its utility, to a by no means large class of specialists, and to speci fied industrial wants. Government geologic investigations seem first to have been begun in France in 1825, followed by England in 1832, Belgium in 1 >\u25a0 3 6 , Russia in 1840, Austria and Spain in 1849, India in 1851, Holland in 1852, Portugal in 1857, Sweden and Norway in 1858, Switzerland in 1859, Prussia in 1862, and Italy in 1868. G. W. Featherstonaugh, an English geologist, was the first to conduct geologic work for the United States in 1834 and 1835, making reports to Colonel Abert, chief of the Corps of Topographical Engineers in 1835 and 1836. Similar examinations specifically authorized continued until 1852, when they were stopped by law, after which geolo gists accompanied exploring parties and geologic exploration itself was revived in 1867, and the present Geological Survey afterward created by statute in 1879. Of the directors of 38 separate Government works (about half of which are more of the nature of a geological reconnaissance), 28 are either pro fessors of geology or practical geologists, 1 a geological surveyor, 7 mining engineers, 1 an officer of the Corps of Military Engineers, and another an Officer of the Army. The total of the professional personnel engaged in these Government works in Europe, between 1882 and 1885, is as follows: Austria 23, Bava ria 3, Belgium 14, Finland 8, France 53, England 57, Hungary 11, Hesse- Darmstadt 2, Italy 25, Portugal 6, Prussia 54, Roumania 3, Russia 9, Saxony 9, Spain 14, Sweden 12, Switzerland 15, and Wurtemberg 6, making a total of 402, consisting, other than the directors, of professors of geology,"], [159, "151 INTRODUCTORY. or practical geologists, mining engineers, mining cadets, university students, paleontologists, collaborators, &c , only a part of whom are under the pay of the Government. Others may be noted as follows : Algeria 3, Cape Colony 2, India 19, Java 5, New Zealand 4, Canada 20, Greenland 4, West Australia 2, and 262 for the United States* The work of these organizations is under the control of commissions in Alsace-Lorraine, Belgium, France, Hesse-Darmstadt, Italy, Luxembourg, Russia, Switzerland, Wurtemberg, which commissions 'are composed of the director ofthe work, in certain cases of officers ofthe Topographic Bu reaus, professors of geology, mining engineers, practical geologists and others. They are directly under the administration of mines in Austria, Bavaria, Finland, France, Italy, Prussia, Russia, Spain, Algeria, Java, New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. The operations are under the direction of the bureau of geodetic and topographic works in Portugal, and under the topographic bureau in Wur temberg. Elsewhere the chiefs or directors appear to report directly to the head ofthe Departments severally known, as of Agriculture and Mining, Public Works, Letters, Science, and Fine Arts, Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, Plome and Interior Departments, Imperial Domain (Russia), Finance (Sax ony), Revenue and Agriculture (India), Department of Mines and Water Supply, &c. It should be mentioned, however, that the several European Govern ment departments above enumerated, enjoy legal jurisdiction over the sev eral industries specified, different from any of the grants of our own con stitution or legislative acts thereunder. Many European Governments, un like the United States, either own or exercise a control over the mineral resources of the State, which in some cases has been the direct cause of the geologic examination. The functions of the geologic works can be better understood by ref- * This number, which includes the director, is taken from \" Schedule of employe's of the U. S.

This entails the production (usually by direct superposition of colors, or by compilation) and publication of general and special geologic maps, based on the topographic map (a separate function in all the older nations), also geologic profiles, sometimes with, as well as without, explanatory text. The decree of organization occasionally points out how and where the resultant colored geologic map shall be executed. Original topographic work, in areas selected by the geologist, has been carried on pari passu with the geological examination in certain newer coun tries where the topographic wrorks have not been brought to a permanently organized state, but in none of the cases observed has the geologist under taken the mathematical, instrumental, triangulation, or topographic work. Monographs and geological and paleontological reports usually form a part of the duties of these offices, as well as the collection and care of all doc umentary evidence requisite, bearing upon the work in hand and of ob jects of geologic and mineralogie interest, as rocks, fossils, &c. These works, although yet young, are highly important and have been conducted with great activity and zeal, often in the face of numerous obsta cles and with sometimes scanty funds, the latter elsewhere than in the United States. The methods of geological examination appear to be more individual than following a formulated convention, the field observations being very simple, especially where the geologist is equipped in advance with a com plete topographic map. The annual expense has been learned for certain countries and will be found in the later text. The cost per square mile it has been difficult to ascertain, if indeed it has ever been strictly computed for any given class of work, for the reason that, independent of the unformulated condition of these works inherent to their very nature, the scope of the investigation, for reasons theoretic or prac tical, may be varied and prolonged indefinitely."], [161, "153 INTRODUCTORY. The matter of conventional signs, especially designed for geologic rep resentation other than the coloration of the topographic map (the latter for topographic, geologic, and statistical maps in the different countries still remaining in an inchoate state) it has been impracticable, for want of time, to compile and compare. The number for England, as shown by the sheet of conventional signs for 1856, is 10 for stratification, 12 indicating metals and one for dykes- Each country has its own conventional signs (some less and others more than the above) while the matter of the unification of colors and signs for geologic representation is undergoing discussion among geologists, having received attention at the last International Geological Congress at Bologne, Italy, and a similar movement in regard to orographic and other represen tation by colors, signs, and abbreviations, in the various kinds of topo graphic maps, occupies the attention of the International Geographical Con gress. The progress in geological maps will be found partly in the lists of maps and separately for each country. The United States has thus far organized no systematic topographic survey of anj^ portion of its territory. An act of Congress for a geological survey has been passed, and works of a trigonometric or topographic char acter for specified purposes (notably those of the Coast and Lake Surveys, that of the Mississippi River and the various wrorks to the west of it) have been earned on. In this regard, while the professional work performed especially by the Coast and Lake Surveys of the United States has been of the first order of merit, yet in the line of progress towards systematic and final results, the United States is in arrears of fourteen other nationalities. To effect the complete topographic survey of the entire country, which will it is believed some day be undertaken in force, the co-operation of the General and State Governments will prove advantageous; the former producing the skeleton basis, with such added details including all natural features, with means of communication and all principal economic or artifi cial details, as are first most needed for its uses, and the States clothing this skeleton with full and complete minor economic topographic details, the cadastral survey included."], [162, "154 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. While the surveys of the various European nationalities have as yet no complete and thorough connection along their boundary or junction lines, having proceeded from independent initial points and bases, with initial level points starting from separate zeros or datum planes, with individual series of triangles and leveling operations, and while the details of topography have not followed the same system, nevertheless for a number of years the effort has proceeded through the \"International Commission for European degrees measurements,\" with a central office at the Geodetic Institute at Berlin, under General Baeyer, late chief of the Prussian Military Topographic Survey, to harmonize and adjust the belts of triangles along selected quadrilaterals, with a view to compare the astronomic and trigonometric measurements of the largest possible arcs of great circles, thus adding to our scientific knowledge of the true and exact figure and dimensions of the earth, and doubtless in time a single datum level plane will be assured for all Europe, to which the series of levels of different countries can be referred, and finally it does not seem too much to hope that as the revision of the various topo graphic surveys progresses that the difference of field and map delinea tion -will disappear and the conventional illustration of the ground for all Europe be made uniform. The above organization is a natural outgrowth from the situation as it presented itself in Europe at the close of the main triangulation of the sev eral countries (usually executed with the highest degree of accuracy attain able with the instruments and formul\u00e6 available and classes of observations in vogue at the epoch when the several works were performed), a neces sary function of the detailed topographic survey, and which afforded abund ant material upon which to base a unified fundamental trigonometric and leveling net, the occupation of the terrain for trigonometric and topo graphic operations, permitting of that intimate study of its structural parts, by wliich alone, the most favorably situated quadrilaterals could be success fully planned and executed. So far as can be learned, independent of the uniformity in observations secured, say, in countries like Spain, Italy, and Austria, where the main triangulation was not complete when the \" Decrees Measurements\" was organized, the observations undertaken have been meas-"], [163, "155 INTRODUCTORY. urements of parallels and meridians, gravity determinations, and more pre cise levelings, connecting independent bench marks. The main features of the foundation of the topographic survey, i. \u20ac., the astronomically and trigonometrically determined points and levels of the first order, having been made, corrected, and revised, with additional re observations of selected quadrilaterals once done, these permanent marks remain, mile-stones of scientific and practical progress that need never be lost. The remaining work becomes more a refinement of detail and accu racy, with a comparison of specified parts and a generalization of the whole, thus confirming with time the tribute that organized civilized Governments are making and have made in aid of physical geography. The main triangulation of England has been connected with that of the Continent and a measurement of the arc of the great circle, by a cor respondence between Governments, determined from Valentia, in Ireland, to Orsk, in the Ural Mountain region of Russia. Hie main triangulation of Spain has also been connected across the Mediterranean with stations in Algeria, and that of Italy with Tunis. In the summing up it can but be noticed, notwithstanding the admira ble and persistent efforts of the European Governments, how little compar atively of the land surface of the globe is made known to us in plentiful topographic detail, by rigid mathematical and instrumental processes. Having in view the experience of our European neighbors as a guide and the well-known energy of the United States, with its enterprises reach ing in all directions within its borders, it still appears that there has never been a direct demand upon the General Government for the establishment of a general topographic survey, suited to the wants of the Government and people, to be developed to perfection of detail with the growth of the coun try in density of population, resources and production; still, while elsewhere the necessary authority may not be found, it must be admitted, that the prosecution of such a work in time of peace by the War Department would be in consonance with the constitutional aim of the Government to \" provide for the common defense,11 in protecting the soil and its in habitants (interior as well as coastwise), a most substantial preliminary to which is an intimate knowledge of all the theaters of action in attack and v"], [164, "156 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. defense, the conformation of ground, the approaches thereto, and the de tailed means of communication, present and prospective, of our entire terri tory; all of which requires the determination of its every topographical feat ure by actual detailed measurement, in pursuance of a systematic and comprehensive general survey, and the maps thereof produced and pre served in peace, where they are first, and most wanted in war, become the mother maps whence should be drawn all those needed for economic and scientific uses, except those for public land subdivisions, and- for revenue purposes, the latter belonging to the States. No large and well conducted nation, of rich and prosperous people, is likely to remain indefinitely unmind ful of their permanent interests, to the extent of neglecting such means for the common defense, as sliall be dictated by the requirements of modem scientific warfare ; hence there ivill doubtless be at no very far distant day an appropri ate general topographic survey ofthe whole country by the War Department. A constant conviction as to the great permanent importance of a prop erly established, accurately and intelligently executed general topographic survey of one's country, with a knowledge ofthe ultimate benefits therefrom to the Government and the people, prompt the presentation of a brief sum mary of certain existing facts, together with conclusions logically reached, after a broad and thorough study, of the experience of the older civilized nations, and of the subject as a whole-.* 1. The Topographic is the indispensable and all-important survey (being gen eral and not special in its character), which underlies every other, including also the graphic basis of the economic and scientific examinations of the country. When properly conducted by thoroughly reliable and intelligent Government officers, it possesses a truthfulness and accuracy above suspicion. When accompanied by its properly executed triangulation, and cartographic factors, to which are added examinations in the Natural History branches of Phy sical Geography, such as Geology, Mineralogy, &c, it becomes a Geographical Survey. 2. This (the Topographic Survey) has been the main or principal general survey in all civilized countries, and all other so-called surveys (as geodetic, trig- * The statements made with regard to all the works herein mentioned are based purely on facts of official record."], [165, "157 INTRODUCTORY. onometric, revenue, or cadastral, geologic, die), special in character, are but accessories or addenda thereto. Wherever special surveys have been attempted prior to the General Topographic Surrey, the latter has had finally to be adopted. 3. By natural selection this (the topographic) survey belongs to the ivar branch of the public service, and in all large and ivell-organized Governments, it has been maintained continuously and, is now found under military administration, and everywhere, without exception, military officers, alone, are eligible to the direction and control of such works. No other branch of Government administration has a general requirement for maps, sufficiently strong, to beget the invariable untiring energy demanded for the prosecution to its conclusion, of such an undertaking, complete and perfect, finally, for the whole country, as compared with the parts thereof naturally and usually selected for examination by specialists. 4. No such survey now exists in the United States. All the present so called surveys could be better and more economically executed if such a ivork -were being prosecuted. 5. All the older civilized countries have had, and now have, such a survey. 6 Such a survey for the United States will soon become imperative for other reasons than for public defense, which requirement, however, is tlie most im portant, general, and lasting in its nature. 7. The results of such a survey become the mother source, whence all other physical examinations may draiv their graphic sustenance. 8. The scope of this topographic survey, subordinated to the objects sought (the latter determined primarily by Government needs) should be defined bylaw; its administration permanently fixed in the War Department ; a co- operation be tween this and all other Departments pointed out by statute; and each Department should have tlie right at stated intervals to present its special requirements before an administrative consultative commission. This survey should embrace all ground admeasurements of a general character required by the Government, not includ ing, however, the subdivision of the public lands or the surveys required for Gov ernment engineering works. 9. Specialists (particularly workers in the theoretical branches of science) must be excluded from the direction and control of this class of works, which when undertaken demand the best endeavor of those having a talent for, and skilled in the exact sciences, in order to secure the first or highest grade of results."], [166, "158 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 10. Government topographic maps, showing the natural and artificial feat ures ofthe ground, ivith the constructions and improvements thereon, are required first and most by the War Service, being of use also to the Civil Administration,. and of assistance to the industries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Mining. They are a pre-requisite for war in its protecting and defending influen ces, as tvell as in its more active operations ; and an aid also to peace in its manifold undertakings, and their uses (increasing with time) accord with the accuracy, rapidity aud cheapness with ivhich they are produced.

This work has proceeded by virtue of various acts of Parliament, of which the following are the most important: 4 and 5 Viet., capt. 30; 33 Viet., capt. XIII; and 38 and 39 Viet., capt. XXXII. The last act (being the last of a number of acts relating to the legal continuation of the work) continued the survey for ten years from 1875, which, it is presumed, has since been further continued until 1890, the year at which it is expected the cadastral survey will be completed, thus estab lishing a limit in time subsequent to which it would appear that revision of surveys is alone contemplated.

When the officers of Royal Engineers were too much engaged in military works to admit of their being extensively employed in military drawings, a corps of Royal Military Surveyors and Draughtsmen was formed for home and foreign service.

The military branch was ultimately developed in the ordnance corps (the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers), under the command of the master general (or in his absence of the lieutenant-general), and the civil branch remained to administer the military branch and to discharge those important functions that may be roughly classified as (1) of custodians of public treasure in lands and stores, (2) of contractors or manufacturers to supply the navy and army with warlike munitions and equipments \" (page 205). \"As a measure, of defense the survey of the United King dom was intrusted to the ordnance department\" (page 217). \"No doubt the ordnance administration was that of the military as a class; indeed the civil branch had become so largely infused with the professional spirit, that it almost ceased to be recognized as a civil branch.\" The organization has not in detail, so far as is known, been either fixed or changed by law, it having been based on that one determined by the director-general in charge and the Secretary of State for War, and remaining intact through all the varying changes of administration. The execution of the professional parts of the work is in the hands of officers of Engineers (usually selected for their special fitness) and selected civilians for instrumental and higher computation work, with draughtsmen, engravers, photographers, &c; non-commissioned officers and selected enlisted men are used also in the drawing, photographic, and engraving departments. The personnel consisted, February 16, 1885, of 30 officers of Royal Engineers, 357 non-commissioned officers and enlisted men, and 2,896 civil assistants and laborers. The officers of Engineers are allowed additional pay for their services on the Ordnance Survey, the amount of which is definitely fixed by regulation; the enlisted men likewise to an amount within certain * The Military Forces ofthe Crown ; their administration aud government, by Charles M. Clode, published by John Murray, London, 1869."], [171, "163 GREAT BRITAIN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. limits, determined by the director-general; while the civilians remaining in service until a given age or for a stated period are entitled (all those enter ing prior to 1870), by virtue of the superannuity act, to a life pension. The headquarters office at Southampton has under the chief the fol lowing divisions: 1. Administration, correspondence, and accounts. 2. Examination of manuscript plans, reduction and drawing of maps for engraving, photozincography, letter-press printing, and electrotyping. 3. Trigonometric branch. 4. Engraving general topographic maps on copper, plate-printing, and coloring maps. There is a special boundary office at London and 10 sub-offices in various parts of England; one in Scotland, at Edinburgh; one in Ireland, at Dublin; the latter two for engraving, publication, and revision. There are also separate offices for carrying on the leveling and con touring work and sketching of the hill features for the 1-inch map. The survey of the United Kingdom may be said to have commenced with the measurement under General Roy, Royal Military Engineers, of the Hounslow Heath base line in 1784, the triangulation of the general survey for the purposes of a military topographic map (scale, 1 inch to 1 mile) dating from 1791 was completed in 1853. In 1824 this map (known as the 1-inch old series) was advanced to include the south of England entire, with parts of Wales and Scotland, when it was practically suspended, that the valu ation survey of Ireland (scale, 6 inches to 1 mile) might be undertaken. This survey of Ireland was finished in 1840 and that for the military map of England as far north as the southern boundaries of Lancashire and York shire. It was then decided to survey the six northern counties of England and Scotland entire on this scale. Yorkshire, Lancashire, the Isle of Lewis, and several counties in the south of Scotland were finished on the 6-inc'h scale in 1851, when about this time the \"battle ofthe scales\" raged and retarded progress for a number of years. In 1851 the 6 -inch scale survey was suspended, and the 1-inch scale ordered for the balance of England and Scotland. In 1852 the 6-inch scale"], [172, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 164 survey was resumed. In 1854 the 1 : 2,500 scale was ordered for two Eng lish counties. About this date the statistical conference at Brussels decided unani mously in favor of the scale of 1:2,500 (25.344 inches to the mile, and therefore commonly styled in England the 25-inch scale) for national cadastral maps. In 1855 this scale was ordered for cultivated districts in four northern counties of England and the unsurveyed parts of Scotland. The unculti vated districts were to be drawn on the 6-inch scale, and the 1:2,500 plans reduced to the 6-inch scale for uniformity in the county maps. Large towns were to be surveyed and drawn on the 1:500 scale, and the 6-inch plots were to be reduced to the 1-inch scale to complete the military map of the whole Kingdom. In 1856 and 1858 these scales were again recommended and continued, and by treasury minute of March 18, 1863, it was directed that the same scale should be \"extended to those portions of the United Kingdom wliich have been surveyed on the scale of 1 inch to 1 mile only.\" As the parish survey progresses all of England and Wales will be published on the 1-inch scale (new series), on a uniform system. When the 1:2,500 survey was commenced in 1855 that of the 6-inch was abandoned. Therefore it was finally determined that the following surveys and revision of surveys and maps should be made : (1) A topographic map of the whole of the United Kingdom on the scale of 1- inch to the mile, (2) County maps of the same on a scale of 6 inches to the mile. (3) Parish plans or cadastral maps of the same on the scale of 1:2,500. (The county of Dublin for Ireland is the only one yet surveyed on this scale.) (4) Plans (scale l:o00) of all towns exceeding 4,000 inhabitants, ex cepting London and vicinity, for wliich the scale of 60 inches to the mile was adopted. (Twenty-five of these plans are equivalent to one sheet on the 1:2,500 scale.) The rate of progress is such as to insure the survey of the whole country in 1888, and to admit of the publication of the maps in 1890, in"], [173, "GREAT BRITAIN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 165 order to accomplish which it has been necessary to largely increase the force of surveyors. The proposal for a cadastral survey of England was first made by Colonel Dawson, R. E., in 1837. The general survey of the whole country (decided upon about the year 1786) for a military map on the scale of 1 inch to 1 mile, or 1:63, 3b*0, having been ordered in 1791, the first general topographic sheet was pub lished in 1801, and the last of this (the first) series in 1871, the field and office work thereof extending over a period of seventy years. The main triangulation has been carried out with the utmost exactitude, commensurate with the refinement of instruments and formul\u00e6 in use at the date of execution, with results computed by means of least squares showing small probable errors. The difference of the length of the base line at Lough Foyle (7.89 miles long) as actually measured and as calculated from the triangulation carried from an independent base, was found to be only five inches. The results of other base lines, measured by the steel chain as compared with those measured by compensated rods, were found to be almost equally as good, and it is claimed that there is not much practical difference in accu racy between the two methods. Base lines, of wliich there are six principal ones, have been measured with compensated rods, each consisting of two bars, the one of iron, the other of brass (Colby's pattern), also b}r steel chains. Primary triangulation has been measured by 36, 24 and 18 inch theodolites with reading microscopes, the sides of the main triangles averaging 35.4 miles, while the longest line thus measured reaches 111 miles. These principal triangles are subdivided into triangles of about 5 miles to the side with a 12-inch theodolite, while the tertiary triangles have sides of about 1 mile, measured with a 7-inch theodolite. The initial datum level for England, Wales, and Scotland was taken at 100 feet below the copper bolt in the south face of St. John's church tower, Old Haymarket, Liverpool, and afterwards referred to a plane not differing materially from mean tide level at Liverpool, which was adopted as 57 feet"], [174, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 166 below the above-mentioned copper bolt. The same for Ireland is taken from the mean high water level at Poolbeg light-house, Dublin. The surveys of all grades are founded on a trigonometric net, the belt of triangles having been developed from well-measured bases connected with initial astronomically determined points. The instruments used have been constructed mostly by Troughton & Sims, and Cooke Brothers, of York, England. Astronomical observations, were made for determining the direction of meridians at given points, also for ascertaining the latitudes and longitudes of various main triangulation stations, the principal instruments employed being zenith sectors.* Production of the manuscript plan. The following is quoted from the annual report of the Ordnance Sur vey for the year ending March 31, 1885 : The original survey and manuscript plan are made on the -^oo scale (about 25 inches to the mile). The great distinction between these operations as carried on on the Ordnance Survey and as performed by civil engineers is that all the operations are done on the Ordnance Survey by different persons, who, therefore, form a check upon each other. Each triangle of the parish triangulation is allotted to a surveyor, who measures on the ground with a chain all the detail contained in the triangle. He is ignorant of the actual lengfhs of the sides of the triangle as obtained by calculation. A second \"To prevent erroneous impressions that may arise, where any part of the work of the Ordnance Survey may have been designated as a \" geodetic survey\" and for the sake of accuracy in expression, which should govern in connection with scientific u ore than all other pnrsuits (wherein things ought to be called by their right names), it may be stated that there has never been any operation carried on in Great Britain, known or styled as a \" geodetic survey,\" the ordnance survey herein described com prising the whole. The latter, in its earlier stages and during the progress of the principal triangula tion, measured or calculated geometrically several arcs of meridians and parallel comparing the same with their lengths obtained astronomically. Observations were also taken at different places to ascertain the deflection of the plumb-hue from local attraction. A junction was also effected of the British and Continental triangulatious, (1) by General Eoy, Royal Engineers, in 1787, and (2) in 1861 under Sir H. James, Eoyal Engineers, which enabled the great arc of parallel from Valentia in Ireland to Orsk in Eussia to be geometrically com puted. The Ordnance Survey has also at different times conducted important comparisons of its lineal standards with those of many foreign countries, including some of the United States. See the following published works of the Ordnance Survey, viz : ft) Principal Triangulation ofthe United Kingdom. (2) Extension ofthe Triangulation of England into France and Belgium. (3) Comparisons of the Standards of Length of England, Eranee, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, and Australia."], [175, "GREAT BRITAIN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 167 assistant lays down the lines on the plan. He sees that the lengths of the main lines, as measured, agree with their lengths as calculated ; if the discrepancy exceeds a certain amount, the line is sent back to the surveyor toberemeasured. This second assistant also lays down the subsidiary lines, and if they will not plot within a certain limit of accuracy, they are also returned to the surveyor to be remeasured. A third assistant plots the detail on the plan. A fourth assistant makes a tracing from the detail, which is given to a fifth assistant, who examines the work on the grouud, and corrects any error. This assistant also collects the names and investigates the spelling. He enters the names in a book, giving three authorities for each. A sixth assistant draws the fair plan. A seventh assistant computes the area of each inclosure on the plan. These are collected together into parishes, and published in parish area books. These operations are carried on in offices, which are scattered over the country, in positions convenient for the work. All the documents are then sent in to the South ampton office, where they undergo a thorough examination. Thus, independent of the final examination at Southampton, there are seven persons employed in the production of the plan, who form mutual checks on each other. All errors, also, which may be made in the survey of a triangle, are strictly confined to that triangle, and have no tendency to spread into the adjoining work. Dynamo-electricity has been substituted in place of battery power, in electrotyping operations, compactness and decrease of cost, .being gained thereby. Steel-wire chains specially tested have been introduced, stronger and 2 pounds less in weight, than the old iron wire surveying chains. Descriptions of the manner of producing the plotting and final sheets, of leveling, contouring, and hill-sketching in the field will be found in Com stock's \" Notes on European Surveys,\" and in more complete form in \"Meth ods and Processes\" of the Ordnance Survey. Geological data are engraved at the Ordnance Survey office on the topographic base at both the 6-inch and 1-inch scales. The publications are sold by the Government at established agencies at very reasonable rates, the receipts for sales for the year 1884 reaching nearly \u00a312,267, or approximately $59,500, while the donations in pursuance of the copyright act to public departments and institutions and libraries, educational establishments and foreign Governments, aggregate approxi mately $20,000.

The latitudinal and longitudinal borders are divided into 1\" spaces. On the margin the number of the adjoining sheets are indicated. The additional features are all houses, barns, out- buildings, wells, fences, hedges, bridges, telegraph and railroad lines. The boundaries of townships and parishes of Great Britain and of the town lands of Ireland are engraved on the sheets ; the relief is shown by level curves of 25 feet. The cadastral charts scale 1 : 2,500 (with description of boundaries, &c.) facilitate the registration, valuation, and transfer of land; the existence of a map on so large a scale naturally leads toward the establishment of a general sys- tem of registration, while it is not at present proposed that it (the map) should be conclusive with regard to the limits of the several estates graph- ically laid down ; a further reference, in instances, being needed to writ- ten documents, conveyances, &c, still, it is evident that a nomenclature of landed estates in England is being slowly, but silently, accumulated, that may be made to serve as the basis of future transfer of title to lands the value of wliich is not likely to be overestimated. The work now being done is more particularly a cadastral survey of the whole United Kingdom on the scale of 25, 3 inches to 1 mile, or 1 : 2,500 (called parish plans), with, also, the continuation of the county maps on the scale iff 6 inches to 1 mile, and the re-engraving of the general topographic map (new series) on the scale of 1 inch to 1 mile, with maps of scale 1 : 5U0 for large towns, and special scales for London, as 60 inches to 1 mile, with special scales also for for- tifications and the approaches thereto, with curves originally of ft feet apart, but latterly 25 feet. The above scales have been in use since 1863. Dur- ing the production of the first 1-inch to 1-mile map, or up to 1870, a pri- mary and secondary triangulation had been made of the whole territory and extended to the tertiary grade for certain areas. It has been estimated that the surveys for the 25-inch map may be completed in the year 1890, appropriations looking to which are being annually granted by Parliament, attention having been directed to the necessity for the early completion of the work, by she report of a committee in 1879, appointed to consider the question of transfers of, and titles to, land."], [177, "GREAT BRITAIN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 169 The 1-inch map (reduced pentographically, photography being inap plicable on account of scale) is published in outline with contours only, and also with hachures without contours. Contours represent vertical inter vals above sea level of 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 feet, according to circumstances. Hill features are represented by contours alone in the 6-inch county and 1-inch general maps, new series, by vertical hachures in the 1-inch general map, by horizontal hachures for scales 1 inch, 1\u00a3 inches, and 4 inches, prepared specially for military purposes and by a combination of contours with horizontal or vertical hachures, in the 6-inch map, specially for military uses. The minor features of the ground being insufficiently shown by con tours for military purposes on the 1 : 10,560 map, altitudes are marked in feet. Special confidential editions for war department uses are made of Ord nance Survey maps on all scales of certain localities where fortifications exist, and these are kept purely for military purposes. It was deemed necessary, by a select committee, who reported on the subject of the cadastral survey in 1862, to revise the work once in fourteen years, and it was then assumed that the profits arising from the sale of maps would cover the expense. The projection is made by a series of rectangular co-ordinates, deduced from given longitudes and latitudes. Sixteen sheets on the scale of 1 : 2,500 are equivalent to a single sheet on the 6-inch scale. In this way the pro jection known as \"six sheets of marginal lines of Col. Sir Henry James,\" has been utilized, the latter being a general projection suited to connected maps of any part of the world. The maps scales 1:63,360, 1:10,560, and 1:2,500 are published in black only, while those of cities and large towns appear in colors. The boundaries of counties, parishes, properties, &c , are pointed out by \"meres men,\" appointed by the local authorities, and when plotted are exhibited within the district, thus affording opportunity to dispute any boundary con sidered incorrect. Each county is composed of a certain number of 6-inch sheets in full or in part. The high and low water lines are both surveyed. The high-"], [178, "170 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. est point in England is Scafell peak, county Cumberland, which is 3,210 feet above sea level; that of Scotland is Ben Nevis peak, which is 4,406 feet in altitude; and in Ireland, Carrantud Hill, county Kerry, which is 3,414 feet in elevation. The seaboard of Ireland is about 2,200 miles. Contours from 5 to 25 feet intervals are shown on the 6-inch 1 : 2,500 and 1:500 scales, and the plans are usually drawn before the fortifications are constructed. The maps of the Ordnance Survey, on the scales of 1 : 2,500, 6 inches to 1 mile, and 1 inch to 1 statute mile, represent the following areas: 1 : 2,500, 1 J miles E. and W., and 1 mile N. and S., equivalent to 960 acres (one square-inch equaling approximately 1 acre; 6-inch, 6 miles E. and W. and4milesN. andS.; 1-inch (England), 18milesE.andW. and 12miles N. and S.; 1-inch (Scotland), 24 miles E. and W. and 18 miles N. and S. This gives the dimensions of 25J inches by 37f inches for the printed portion of a sheet of 1 : 2,500 ; ?,6 by 2 4 inches for a 6-inch, and 12 inches by 17f inches for a 1-inch sheet (England). The want of a geometrically connected projection for the old series of 1-inch maps (different meridians being employed) has been supplied in the new series, one central meridian being used. The methods of graphic illustration are principally by hand engraving on copper, zincography, and photozincography (see \"Photozincography\"), the latter for the 1 : 2,500 plans. The scales for the general maps of the country are 1 inch and 6 inches (1:63,360 and 1:10,560), while the scale of 1:2,500 for property valuation is employed for all England and Wales and the cultivated portions of Scotland, and is generally known as the inch-to the-acre scale. Items of current annual cost are shown by Report of Progress for 1885, as follows: Pay and allowances of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, in addition to their regi- mental pay \u00b0. \u00a324,025 Pay of civilian assistants J4j qqq Pay of laborers 3^000 Total of the above 204 625 Or approximately (1\u00a3 at $4.85) \u00ab99j 431 The total appropriated for the year 1884-'85 was \u00a32*9,905 (approximating $1,365,936.40) ; that estimated for 1885-'86 is \u00a3295,506 (approximating $1,433,640.60.

The cost of the ordnance cadastral survey for the 1 : 2,500 scale from 1872-'73 to 1881-'82 (ten years) was \u00a3l,059;800, exclusive of the pay of military officials and men. The above is of course in addition to the cost of the primary astro nomical and triangulation work and the expense of the survey on the scale of 1 inch to 1 mile and 6 inches to 1 mile carried on before the commence ment of the cadastral survey in 1862. The cost of secondary and tertiary triangulation, in addition to the above, and being a part of the 23 pence per acre, taken from an average of four years, is 1.21s?. per acre, oi' approximately $15 per square mile. It was impracticable to obtain official figures giving the cost of the separate parts of the work, as for astronomy, triangulation, topography, &c. ; still it was learned at the Southampton office that the total cost to December 31, 1881 (taking for the year 1871-'72 \u00a3200,354), actually was \u00a34,545,050, or $22,725,250, thus determining an average expenditure of $186.00 per square mile to that date. During that period 11,053,000 acres were surveyed and 10,706,000 acres published, or an average of 10,879,000, at an average cost of 23 pence per acre \u2014 approximately 46 cents, or $294.40 per square mile.

So far as is known no other branch of the Government issues topo graphic maps of any part of the United Kingdom. In contradistinction to the plane-table method for obtaining interior topographic details in vogue on the continent of Europe, the chain and traverse measurement process obtains in England, which is undoubtedly superior for the critical result of detailed distances required for the cadastral survey, while for purposes of general topography the plane-table offers the advantage of speed with tolerable accuracy, being deficient in exact values of the dimensions of special tracts.* Revision of plans. On account of the great changes that are constantly being made by the inclosure of waste lands, the erection of buildings, and other alterations in the face of the country, it will become necessary to periodically revise the published maps, and experiments have lately been made in revisional surveys, with the view to obtaining the requisite information as to the probable extent and cost of revision on the larger scales. The original archives are held of record at the Southampton office, where also the copper and zinc plates (being of themselves most valuable originals) are stored in fire-proof structures. England, joining with the con tinental countries of Belgium, Holland, Germany, Denmark, and Russia, contributed its share to the measurement of the longest determined arc of a great circle of approximately 77\u00b0 in longitude, reaching from Valentia, Ireland, to Orsk, in the Ural Mountains. The detailed instructions and forms of record for field work are numer ous and the result of long practical experience, and by means of which it is easy to trace each and every measurement, thus making the original ar chives a record, which may be of further service later should maps of larger scales be required, and in cases of disputed property boundaries. * It has been proposed, and partially practiced, to replace the plane-table in Germany by the use of the theodolite and stadia."], [183, "175 GREAT BRITAIN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. It would appear that the cadastral survey of Great Britain, carried on with the method and accuracy of so experienced and stable an organi zation as the Ordnance Survey, based on and checked by the initial measured bases and well-developed nets of triangulation, ranks in many ways as the first of such undertakings, especially as regards uniformity and care and comprehensiveness in relation to detail When done an areal map, in acres (scale 1:2,500), will be produced of England, Wales, and Scotland, which will serve as a graphic index for more purposes than one in the economic use and distribution of properties, and can but be found to be of more and greater use as time elapses. The geological maps of the United Kingdom are based on the topographic sheets of the 1-inch and 6-inch scales, advantage of the production of these sheets and even of the more detailed scale (1.: 2,500) being taken by the geologist preliminary to his actual field studies. The advantage of detailed maps prepared in advance for the geologist is well recognized in England, as well as in all modern Europe; indeed they are considered a sine qua non,, and the examination of a given district is often delayed until the topo graphic map thereof has been prepared and published. The use of the detailed maps by the various departments of the Government and the public is found to increase somewhat in proportion to the time elapsed since the particular survey and the minuteness of the scale. Services are performed by the Ordnance Survey for other Government departments, as, for instance, engraving for the Geological Survey, ascer taining boundaries for the census, areas for Crown offices, trigonometric points for the Admiralty, maps for the local government board, manuscript plans for the home office, special maps and local surveys when called for by the Stationary and War Offices, surveys for the Irish land commission, land judge's court and valuation departments of Ireland, the Exchequer Office, Edinburgh, Dublin Metropolitan Police, Colonial, Foreign and India Offices, &c. The amount of \u00a3100,000, approximate, per annum, the usual sum appropriated until 1880, was sufficient to allow of the completion of the cadastral survey by the year 1900, while the acceleration due to the increase of appropriation makes it possible that this work may be finished in 1890, or ten years earlier."], [184, "176 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS.

The system of subdivision is identical with that established in 1803 by Professor Mansfield, of the United States Military Academy, for the parcel ing of the outlying lands of the United States, with such slight modifica tions as have been called forth by established precedents and special cir cumstances. In the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec there has been no general plan of subdivision, each survey being a separate one, thus leading to another class of operations for purposes of registration. PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA). Land subdivision. The provincial government of Quebec has not thus far any trigono metric or topographic surveys, except the former for special objects and areas, and even these detached operations having no uniform system. Outside of Bayfield's Hydrographic Charts of the St. Lawrence, pub lished in 1850, there is nothing indicating other hydrographic surveys. BRITISH COLUMBIA. Land subdivision. As yet no distinct system for the purpose of carrying on trigonometric, geographic, and topographic surveys has been organized, although somewhat extensive geological explorations have been made under the Dominion Government in this Province. (See Geological Survey of Canada.) The hydrographic survey of the coast and adjacent islands has been made by the British Admiralty. (See English Hydrographic Surveys.) JAMAICA. The duties of the surveyor-general of the colonial government of Jamaica are confined to the administration of the government lands and to the decision of constantly arising land questions.

In the early stages of the colony, and with the increase of population, changes and con veyances of property incident thereto made surveys in the more settled por tions necessary, and, although isolated, they were connected by rough trav erse lines following routes of communication, accomplished by circum ferenter compass and chain. From 1836 to 1851, while remaining under the government of the parent colony (New South Wales) the surveys were con ducted by the surveyor-general, and were confined to the subdivision of lands required for settlement, having at the same time in view the general location on the map of the main rivers and mountain ranges, from traverses based upon magnetic needle surveys. In 1 851, Victoria starting as a sepa rate colony, a large influx of emigrants, incident to the gold discoveries, ne cessitated the establishment of new townships and land surveys. Although, with the increase of operations, greater care was bestowed upon accuracy, the surveys still remained more or less isolated, and with no general plan of connection. Discrepancies in nieridians and standards became apparent, which could only be reconciled by reference to one established initial point. In 1858 the first scientific survey, entitled the \"Geodetic Survey of Victo ria,\" commenced. The 145th degree of longitude east of Greenwich was adopted as the standard meridian, based upon observations at Williamstown Observatory, its position being fully ascertained by a long series of transit observations and triangulation. Other meridians, the 144th and 146th, and intersections with parallel 37\u00b0 S., were subsequently established, and also became standards from which others could be differentiated. For the execution of this survey an organization consisting of a super intendent, six geodetic surveyors, and the necessary assistants and computers, was perfected. A base-line near Werribee was selected and the colonial observatory at Williamstown adopted as a starting point for latitude and longitude. Changes in the mode of settlement introduced by the legisla ture in 1869 made the rapid determination of fixed points in all parts ofthe territory necessary, and to a great extent destroyed the practical value of the geodetic principle; under the \"free-selection\" system then intro duced, any settler being at liberty to take up and occupy 320 acres of Crown land before survey, the boundaries to te established by contract sur-"], [190, "182 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. veyors. An enormous demand for lands followed the passage of this law, and the lands department became unable to supervise and control these iso lated surveys, as regards compliance with regulations. Thus, the practical value and utility of the geodetic survey being in a great measure dimin ished, it ceased to be a separate survey, and was absorbed by the survey department (more purely land parceling), which is engaged in surveys and resurveys required to perfect the titles of the locators, who have already or who are daily taking up lands. That the application of accurate scientific principles cannot enter into the prosecution of these surveys is easily un derstood, as no attempts are made to secure anything but the practical exactness that can be obtained from the use of the theodolite and chain in the establishment of boundaries. Possibly, in the future, when all the lands are disposed of, a cadastral survey may be required, and then the geodetic basis for the general survey will doubtless assume its proper place. This is an example of an attempt to apply a trigonometric check net, fundamentally based, to the extending disconnected selections of public lands, being rapidly taken up by settlers, which in practice had to be abandoned. An attempt to introduce something of a like nature into the land parceling surveys of the United States was made without success be fore the House Committee on Public Lands in 1878 (see Mis. Doc. No. 55, H. of R, 45th Cong., 2d Sess). The following maps illustrate the work and operations of the colonial survey ; departmental map of continental Australia, scale 1 inch to 50 miles ; of Victoria (4 sheets), scale 1 inch to 8 miles ; triangulation map, 1 inch to 12 miles ; geodetic map, 1 inch to 35 miles ; map of specimen of engraving, scale 1 inch to 20 miles ; map of Melbourne, scale 1 inch to 10 chains ; map of parish plans, scale 1 inch to 10 chains; map of towmship, scale 1 inch to 4 chains ; map of features of mining district, scale 1 inch to 20 chains. Regulations, governing the work of the contract surveyors, with de scription of instruments used and methods employed, are issued. The cost of the geodetic survey for 1858-'59-'60 was \u00a3l 1 ,057 18s. 6d. or approximat ing $55,289.50. This sum represents the cost of establishing, approxi mately, 600 miles of geodetic lines, principally standards. No estimate of probable expense of the completion can be given. It was originally"], [191, "SOUTH AUSTRALIA, &C\u2014 LAND SUBDIVISION. 183 intended that the geodetic survey lines should precede and form the basis of the contract system, but the necessity of rapidly subdividing large areas for settlement compelled a departure from this plan. SOUTH AUSTRALIA. Land subdivision. The surveyor-general of this colony is charged with the duty of divis ion of public lands and the establishing of boundaries of such parcels thereof as have become the property of individuals, either permanently by title, or temporarily by lease. In the prosecution of these surveys a certain amount of topographic material is gathered, and the results thus obtained are embodied in the fol lowing kinds of plans, viz: 1. General plan, 15 sheets, scale 1 inch to 8 miles. 2. General plan of southern portion, 1 sheet, scale 1 inch to 16 miles. 3. County plans, in separate sheets, scale 1 inch to 2 miles. 4. Hundred plans in separate sheets, scales, 1 inch to 1 mile and 1 inch to J mile (originally plotted on scale of 1 inch to 20 chains, then reduced and multiplied by photolithography). 5. Plans showing boundaries of \"runs or pastoral leases,\" in sheets, containing approximately 18,000 square miles of country, scale 1 inch to 8 miles; also similar plans containing about 9,000 square miles, scale, 1 inch to 4 miles. 6. Township plans, in separate sheets, at scales of 1 inch to 2 and 4 chains. Miscellaneous plans, such as exploration, railway, telegraph, statistical, &c, are produced on various scales, as required. QUEENSLAND (AUSTRALIA). Trigonometric surveys of this colon}' have only been recently au thorized by parliament, but no system or organization has as yet been perfected. NEW ZEALAND. Land subdivision. The survey of the coast of New Zealand was made about forty years ago under the British Admiralty, while the geographical, trigonometric,"], [192, "184 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. topographic, and land parceling surveys were intrusted to the surveyors of the colonial government. The general survey of the colony comprehends two branches, viz, geographical and settlement, or standard and sectional, and it may be an ticipated that this will remain the case till the advancement of wealth and increase of scientific institutions permit the undertaking of a topographic survey upon a trigonometric basis. The geographical operations are based upon astronomic and telegraphic observations, combined with primary and secondary triangulation. The first survey or reconnaissance depends upon known points, and a rough triangulation, with natural objects for trigonometric points, is carried over the country to be mapped. From these points the courses of rivers, the limits of forests, plains, and lakes are sketched in, and their main sub sidiary features established by tangent bearings. Thus a competent sur veyor, with two men and three or four pack-horses, is able to survey an area of from 400 to 500 square miles per month. The instruments employed are a 4-inch theodolite, prismatic compass, and steel tape. The field-notes are plotted at the scale of half an inch to the mile, and the resulting map, together with the description of the land by the survej^or, furnishes the authorities an excellent idea of the country and its capabilities for settle ment at very small expense. Latitude determinations by sextant and arti ficial horizon are occasionally employed as checks. Next in order, if the country is deemed suitable for settlement, is the establishment of standards from the astronomical meridian. The triangula tion is then proceeded with by means of a 5-inch theodolite, and bases are measured by a steel tape under a uniform strain of 14 pounds. The sides of the triangles are usually 2 and 3 miles in length. All the angles of each tri angle are observed and repeated on different parts of the limb. The error of closing has been found rarely to exceed 2 links to the mile. Simultane ously with the triangulaton, the same observer carries on a topographical reconnaissance the plot from which indicates the future lines of main roads, heights of hills, saddles, confluence of rivers, plains, &c. The topographic surveys are plotted on a scale of 2 inches to the mile, and the combined cost of triangulation and topography is estimated"], [193, "185 FIJI ISLANDS AND CAPE COLONY\u2014 LAND SUBDIVISION. at from 1 to 2 pence, approximating 2 to 4 cents per acre, or from $12.80 to $25.60 per square mile. FIJI ISLANDS (BRITISH COLONY) Since the recent annexation of this group of islands by Great Britain, the newness of the settled form of government has only admitted of settle ments and .decisions of land questions, arising from purchases of land by Europeans from natives prior to becoming a British colony, and to the sur vey of such native lands for Europeans as may have been passed upon by the colonial government. The surveys are, on account of the scattered nature of the old purchases of land from natives, very much detached and only connected by a rough cursory survey of the coast, but so far no maps have been published. Seven surveyors are employed in measuring lands purchased by Europeans from the natives preparatory to the issue of grants therefor. No general system of survey seems likely to be adopted until the desultory surveys are completed, and when called for must be done in the face of numerous difficulties, in a region visited with 100 inches average rainfall, heavily timbered in parts, and with abrupt slopes often rising di rectly from the water's edge. No geological examinations have been made. Hydrographic surveys have been conducted by the United States and the British Admiralty. CAPE COLONY (AFRICA). Prior to the year 1752 no attempt at anything like a general delinea tion of the then Dutch possessions at the Cape had been made. In that year the Abbe' La Caille, at the instance of the Academy of Sciences of France, measured an arc of meridian between Cape Town and Piquetberg. His memoir thereon presented to the Academy was accompanied by a sketch map of the country between the Stellenbosh Range on the east and the coast on the west. From that date on up to 1821 a few rough maps were compiled from approximate coast charts and exploring notes and route sketches of travel ers, when Captain Owen made a \"running survey\" of the southern coast"], [194, "186 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. joining to that of another officer on the west coast. Thus the geographical knowledge of the Cape was limited up to 1 839, when Sir Thomas Ma clear, the astronomer royal, was directed to verify and extend the La Caille arc, while even in 1860 Captain Bailey, Royal Military Engineers, was ordered to continue the triangulation, difficulties having been experienced because of want of sufficientlv accurate topographic data. In the mean time military re connaissances, under the direction of Colonel Holloway, were made between 1819 to 1825, which, however, proved inadequate. The insufficiency of material for map-making may, in a great measure, be traced to the manner in which this colony originated land settlements. The early settlers selected locations without regularity, and although, in accordance with the registry system of Europe, these farms were surveyed and described for the purpose of future conveyance, these surveys, executed by different surveyors of clif erent ability, and without uniformity of system, remained isolated. The office of surveyor-general of the colony was established in 1828, and more recently, since 1 860, extensive and precise land surveys have been executed, with instructions to refer to the trigonometric stations of Maclear and Bailey, the greater portion of which are still in existence. Naturally, the duties of the surveyor-general are restricted to the administration of Crown lands and the disposal thereof by sale or lease, as well as to the decision of land and title questions arising out of the old Dutch system of land grants with ill-defined boundaries. In 1877-'78amap of the Cape Colony was compiled (scale, 1 : 1,000,000). The following plans have been received: Captain.Bailey's triangula tion of southern portion of Cape Colony, with report; of division of East London; of King William's Town and Cape Peninsula; of territories ad jacent to Cape Colony; of Basuto Land, Transkeian territory, and eastern border district; of Cape Colony, one of date 1876, and another scale 1 inch to 800 rods.

The geological survey of England was originally begun as a private investigation by the late Sir Henry de la Beche. It was first organized in 1832 as a branch of the Ordnance Survey, the operations being commenced in the southwest of England. The geological survey of Ireland was commenced in 1845, under Captain (afterwards Sir Henry) James, Royal Engineers, as chief. The geological survey of Scotland was commenced in 1854, but it was not made a distinct branch of the service until 1867 when the survey of Great Britain was divided into that of England and Wales, under Professor Ramsay as director, and that of Scotland under Mr. A. Geikie, a reorganization of the personnel being made, with a large addition to each staff. The work remained as a branch of the Ordnance Survey until 1845, when it was given a separate administration under the Department of Woods and Forests (Public Works). It was afterwards transferred to the Board of Trade, and in 1853 to the Science and Art (Education) Department, where it now remains. The whole work, embracing England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, is now under the control of a director-general (at present Mr. Archibald Geikie, LL. D., F. R. S.), with a central office in London and two subordinate but somewhat independent offices for Scot land and Ireland, respectively, at Edinburgh and Dublin. An act of Parliament giving geological surveyors the right to enter on private land and break ground for obtaining information, &c, was the only one known to the head office in London; otherwise, the survey proceeds in view of annual money grants.

The appointment of those selected is subject to the approval of the First Lord of the Council on Education. The work of both grades is similar, each geologist being intrusted with the survey of a definite district (usually a particular sheet of the ordnance map), and is responsible for its completion, the work in .the field being inspected occasionally by the director or district surveyor, when, upon completion, a fair copy is made, wliich, upon approval, is prepared for the engraver. The scheme of organization provides for the supervision of assistants by trained geologists, and of placing the former on independent work when found qualified. The headquarters staff comprises officers in charge of stores and accounts (also secretarial duties), and supervision in jmblications, with a number of clerks, &c. The paleontological branch consists of four paleontologists, with assistants and collectors, the latter employed partly in the field as required, or in the fossil branch of the Museum. Formerly specialists, as chemists, botanists, and mining geolo gists, were attached to the London office, but vacancies occurring have not been filled. The surface lines of principal dislocations, crops of mineral lodes, dips of strata, direction of cleavage, &c, are shown. In the north of England the 6-inch-scale map is used for plotting the notes, but not always published, except in important mineral districts ; but in all cases reduction is made to the smaller scale. Horizontal and vertical sections to illustrate structure are prepared, the former, scale 6 inches to 1 mile, both for heights and distances, the sections being usually normal to"], [197, "189 GREAT BRITAIN\u2014 GEOLOGIC. the general strike. When necessary, the details of formations are shown by vertical sections on a larger scale (for coal measures 1 : 480). Exposed fossiliferous strata are, when necessary, given on a large scale, the names of characteristic fossils being placed alongside of each bed, through the aid of the paleontologist. Another section of the work is the preparation of descriptive memoirs, either as short pamphlets confined to details, applying to single sheets or plates of sections, or large memoirs, affording the amplest geological description of a given district, as, for in stance, the London Basin. It is stated that the perfection of the ordnance maps is so great that there is but little need for the use of instruments, especially upon the 6-inch scale, nearly all the work being sketched upon the printed maps, with simple measurements to the nearest fixed objects. In mountain sections, however, it sometimes becomes necessary to fix the point of observation by cross sights, which is done with an ordinary prismatic compass. For determining strata dips, a semicircular pendulum clinometer is employed, or a smaller one mounted on a pocket-compass. When alone the 1 -inch-scale map is available, the lines of section are run by chain and level, in cases demand ing great accuracy, or ordinarily by a small theodolite, reading to minutes. Where 6-inch maps are at hand any measurements for surface sections are unnecessary, as the 50 feet equidistant contours of the map, suffice for a section in any direction. In mountain districts aneroid barometers are occasionally used. The final maps are published usually on the scale of 1 inch to 1 mile and partially at that of 6 inches to 1 mile. These maps, with boundary lines of formations added, are engraved and printed at the office of the Ordnance Survey at Southampton upon requisition of the director-general. They are then culored by hand according to a standard of conventional signs, in preference to chromo-lithographic reproduction, on account of the size of each edition which is kept at a minimum on account of the neces sary revisions. The plates are engraved by contract under Her Majesty's stationery office, where books for this as for all other Government depart ments are printed.

During this peiiod it is stated that the work has embraced 90,384 square miles. The number of the staff has varied from 13 in 1854 to 57 in 1881. The total number, for England, of maps of the 1-inch scale published to 1884 was 248 sheets, and of the 6-inch maps published to 1884, 218 sheets. There had been sold during the eleven years ending 1880, 25,050 copies of maps on the 1-inch and 4,535 on the 6- inch scale, the least number being 132 for 1870 and the greatest number 824 for 1876 of the latter maps; of the former (1 inch) 1,573 in 1879 being the minimum,. and 3,648 in 1873 the maximum sale. There had been issued up to Janu ary 1, 1885, for Scotland, on the one-inch scale, 33 sheets, and on the six inch scale 130 sheets; and for Ireland, 180 sheets on the former and 10 on the latter scale, making a total of 909 sheets or quarter sheets, geologi cally colored, and published for the whole United Kingdom at the end of 1884.

In 1881 the personnel numbered twenty, including the director. The annual reports of progress as late as 1883 were submitted to the minister of the interior for the information of the governor-general in council. The functions of this work appear to have embraced explorations, sur veys, and scientific investigations in the provinces and territories of the British Dominions from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, having generally in view the preparation of mineralogical and geological maps. The absence of complete detailed topographic maps has led to the prosecution of certain topographic work. The compiled base maps are taken from the admiralty surveys and from the plats of the Crown lands department and notes by individuals of the organization. The observations possible to make, except forlimited areas, in. the prov inces bordering the St. Lawrence and the great lakes, has been more in the nature of a geologic reconnaissance, more especially so in the unexplored regions of the northwest territory and British Columbia. The principal publications are Reports of Progress, usually accompa nied by sketches, and to which series belongs a portfolio of maps. These commenced in 1843, since which they have appeared almost annually. There have been also 12 special reports, four volumes (decades) of \" Figures and descriptions of Canadian organic remains,\" with several cat alogues and descriptions of fossils, by Messrs. Hall, Billings, Dawson, and Whiteaves as authors.

A first geologic examination was ordered by the government of the colony during 1839 and '40, and J. Beete Jukes was appointed geological surveyor. A general report was published in London (1843), with a gen eral map of the island, with geological colors, for a part of the coast that had been explored. The more systematic geological examination of Newfoundland has been in progress, under Mr. Alexander Murray, since 1864, with one assistant. In order to illustrate the formations with a reasonable degree of accuracy it became necessary to make topographic as well as geological observa tions from which to compile a topographic map, as a basis for the geolog ical representation, as in 1864 it is stated that the entire surface of the island outside of the coast line was a \"terra incognita,\" or at best incorrectly represented on any map. Reports of progress have been submitted annually to the government of Newfoundland, which, independent of geology, em brace considerable geographical matter. These reports from 1864 to 1880 inclusive, revised and corrected, have lately been published in one volume Svo, without maps, by Stanford of Charing Cross, London. In 1873 a geological map of Newfoundland on a small scale was published, showing the general distribution of the formations, a second edition was published in 1879, and in 1880-81 an orographical map (scale 1 inch to 7 miles) giving the latest geographical information, both of the coast and interior. The last report of progress for the year 1881 (with two large geolog ical maps of the Peninsula of Avalon, scales 4 inches to 1 mile and 1 inch to 4 miles, by A. Murray and James P. Howley), was published at St. John's, Newfoundland, 1882. Since 1883 the survey has been abandoned. Independent of the annual reports the office at St. John's prepares manuscript maps, results of the field work of a number of localities and on various scales, a list of which will be found on page 425 of the above volume.

The government of this colony ordered a preliminary geologic recon naissance, which was executed from 1857 to 1858, by Andrew Wylley, geological surveyor to the colony. Two reports, without maps, were pub lished in 1859. The discovery of gold and diamonds has caused the geolog ical examination to be re-established since 1871, under the ministry of Crown Lands and Public Works, with E. J. Dunn, as geologist, at Cape Town. A dozen preliminary reports (4\u00b0) have been published since then, with some local maps of the regions where coal has been found. Besides, Mr. Dunn has published a general geological map, employing the conventional signs used in Great Britain, under the title \"Geological Sketch Map of South Africa (no date), London, Stanford,\" in one large sheet, which comprises Cape Colony proper, Namaqualand, Bushmanland, Griqualand, Kaffirland, Basutoland, Orange Free State, Natal, and the Transvaal Republic as far north as Limpopo River. Data is now being accumulated for a revision of this map No systematic work is being prosecuted, a few hundred pounds being occasionally devoted to specific purposes. Mr. Dunn has been accumulating for twelve years facts bearing on the geology of South Africa. NEW ZEALAND. Geologic.

The gold-field commissioners and wardens have usually reported annu ally on their districts, including therein geologic data. Prior to 1877 great irregularity prevailed as to publication; subsequently, however, a regular annual report embodies all information.

Those entering the Baltic are (1) the Vistula (130 German=565.5 statute miles), with 7 affluents; (2) the Oder (121 German\u2014 526 statute miles), with 19 affluents; (3) the Niemen or Memel (116 German=505 statute miles, 20 German miles in Germany), with 2 affluents; the Pregel (25 German\u2014 108.7 statute miles), with 4 trib utaries, and the Schlei, Trave, Scheventine, Warnow, Rechnitz, Rega, Per santi, Wipper, Stolpe, Lupow, Leba, Passarge, Fresching, Minge, and Dange. Also the Danube, tributary to the Black Sea (374 German=l,627 statute miles), with 8 affluents. The personnel of the Prussian topographic survey consists of officers of the Etat Major or General Staff, with officers of military engineers, artil lery, cavalry, and infantry (about fifty in number), associated by detail, with the requisite number of technical officials, as computers, draughtsmen, engravers, &c. The chiefs of divisions are also professionally engaged at the National Military School (Kriegs Akademie) at Berlin, and know in advance the proper persons to select for survey positions. Although a per diem is allowed while on field duty to cover extra expenses, still it is stated that the pay of the officers is less than that of civilians of equal acquirements ; the experience is found valuable in the later military service of the officer and a high esprit du corps"], [212, "204 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. prevails, each officer being fully imbued with the trust confided and honor conferred and the necessity of faithfulness and accuracy of work. The topographic survey has been considered superior to the land or horizontal survey in that it is based upon higher mathematics, requiring superior trained intelligence for selecting the objects to be represented, while the latter is more mechanical, following technically certain critically established principles ; hence, while the land or cadastral survey may be made of assistance to the topographic survey it never can replace it. For all Europe, except England, the cadastral or land survey has been held separate from the general topographic survey. The miscellaneous maps of Prussia have been the Reymann chart, of 1 : 200,000 (462 sheets), and Liebnow's map, 1 : 300,000. PRUSSIA. In Prussia, prior to 1816, there existed only the works of a few Govern ment departments and individuals. In this year the topographic surveys were transferred from the Statistical Bureau to the General Staff of the army. First period (1816 to 1830). \u2014 A military map of Prussia was made be tween 1.816 and 1830, on a scale of 1 : 86,400, principally by commissioned officers, introducing the plane-table in 1821. The eastern part was reduced to the scale of 1 : 100,000, the western remaining at 1 : 86,400, neither being published on account of insufficiency of material, the result being more of a geographical sketch. Second period (1830 to 1865). \u2014 For the early part of this period offi cers were detailed for three years only, then making way for others, which proved of more experience to the officer than value to the map. Equidistant horizontal curves, signifying the commencement of the third period, were introduced in 1846. The following is the order in which the survey proceeded : Posen, south of latitude 53\u00b0, 1830 to 1832. Pommerania, 1833 to 1838. Brandenburg, 1833 to 1845. Westphalia, 1836 to 1842."], [213, "205 PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. Rhine Province, 1843 to 1850. Saxony and Thuringian states, 1842 to 1859. A commission in 1862 recommended an immediate and more extended triangulation. The establishment of a bureau for the triangulation of the country was effected in 1865, with an annual appropriation of 51,000 thalers = $38,250, approximately. The personnel consisted of\u2014 1 . Chiefs of survey and triangulation parties, being commissioned offi cers who were already employed at the trigonometric work of the General Staff, or such other officers as had been through a course of higher geodesy at the War Academy and distinguished themselves for their efficiency, for positions as \"dirigents\" and triangulators ofthe first and second classes. 2. For the detailed triangulations, sergeants of artillery, who had to be graduates of the artillery school. The organization was as follows : 1 major-general, as chief. 1 field officer, as chief of division. 5 captains, as chiefs of surveys. 8 first and second lieutenants, detailed for the purpose. 24 first sergeants and sergeants of artillery. Not less than thirty points were insisted upon for each plane-table sheet (2^ German square miles) instead of 3 as formerly. Third period (since 1865). \u2014 The commission of 18'>2, which had not considered the use of the then extended triangulation for a new map, was succeeded, in 1869, by a new commission, wherein the General Staff was represented. It was found to be absolutely impossible to represent on one and the same map everything necessary for the various departments of the Govern ment and for industrial wants, and that were it possible, it would be but squandering time and money to extend the same care and precision to all sections of a great country with the knowledge that for small sections only could such refinement be utilized, therefore the idea of a \"Unit\" map (Ein-"], [214, "206 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. heits Karte) to meet all requirements was abandoned at the first session of the commission. This commission, however, agreed that \u2014 1. An accurate \"Uebersichts\" map (one over which the eye can be readily cast) should be prepared, on which all general projects, plans, &c, could be based. 2. Additional detailed mensuration when necessary to be executed thereafter, independently in the various Government departments and be confined to specified objects only. As regards the \"Uebersichts\" map the original plane-table sheets of the General Staff were found to answer fully as such, especially after intro ducing such changes, when required, as would enhance their current value. A central commission for the survey of the state of Prussia was proposed, and the order of the King creating the same was issued June 21, 1870. This central commission consists of \u2014 1. The chief of the General Staff of the army as chairman 2. The commissioners of different departments as members These members were to come principally from \u2014 1. Treasury Department : Division of forests and forestry and crown do mains and of direct taxation. 2. Department of Commerce \u2022 Division of railroads and of roads and river improvements. 3. Department of Agriculture : Division for the amelioration of land and communal divisions. 4. Department of Education : Geodetic institute. 5. War Department and General Staff: Division of surveys and geo graphical-statistical division of the General Staff. 6. Navy Department: Division of hydrography and coast survey. 7. Department of the Interior : One representative. The functions of the central commission are as follows : 1. To organize, conduct, and supervise all the extended triangulations and topographic work confided to the general staff, in so far as its func tions relate to all the departments. 2. To prevent duplication, and to consolidate works of the same char acter, so far as this relates to the detailed surveys of the different depart ments."], [215, "PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 207 3. To establish a register of all surveys and maps made at the expense of the state, and for the purpose of supplying all Government offices with all necessary information and results connected therewith. It is the duty of this commission to receive annual reports (at its ses sions in December) of all work done, and to examine the special projects for the next year's work, and also for the second year, in regard to the re quirements in general, and to revise and modify the same. The commissioners are to submit at regular or occasional meetings a detailed report as to the results of any works of mensuration so as to make them generally available. Besides this the central commission has to examine into the methods and intruments in use and the published results, to see that the same are, as much as the means and time will permit, in accordance with the advanced state of the science of surveying. The central commission was placed under the charge of the State De partment, and its members, as far as these were salaried officers or officials, receive no extra pay. A small appropriation pays for clerks, miscellaneous expenses, &c, and for scientific purposes. The central commission held its first session May 11, 1872. At its first deliberations the following conclusions were reached : 1. A triangulation of the entire state to be made and the establishment of not less than 10 trigonometric points to the square mile (German), marked by stone monuments, the same with the adjacent ground to become Govern ment property. 2. The topographic surveys to be made with the plane-table and stadia at a scale of 1:25,000 with equidistant contours. 3. The results of the surveys are to be published at the original and also at a reduced scale according to current wants. 4. The area to be surveyed annually to be 200 square miles (German). The topographic survey to follow the triangulation immediately, and the maps to be published as early as possible. 5. The revision by reconnaissance of older surveys to be made as far as necessary."], [216, "208 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 6. And also to carry on all work of a purely military character, and such as should be found necessary for the special service of the General Staff The result of all the deliberations was the creation of the state survey under the charge of the General Staff, the final organization of which was effected January 1, 1875, after having provided for educating the technical personnel, by gradually enlarging the original topographical section of the General Staff. The present organization for the triangulation was perfected in 1865, and that for the topography in 1873. THE PRUSSIAN STATE SURVEY. Topographic. The area embraced by the Prussian state survey, in connection with the 1:100,000 map (not including, of Germany, the territory of Saxony, Bavaria, Wurtemberg and Baden), is 159,947 square statute miles, with 33,412,115 inhabitants in 1880, or an average of 209 to the square mile. The state topographic survey forms a distinct and independent branch, with many powers of self-control, of the General Staff military establishment brought to so great perfection in its organization and comprehensiveuess of purpose by field marshal the Count Von Moltke. The divisions of the General Staff establishment, practically an inde pendent administration in times of peace, are strategical (Nos. I, II, and III); Railroads, IV; Historical, V; Statistical, VI. The strategical divisions are so divided that the sum of the functions of the three embrace the data essential to the fullest and most exact understanding of all the political and landed divisions of the globe, the approaches thereto, the communications between, the exigencies of and opportunities for military occupation, with the strategical lines therefor, and in general all such information concern ing the races of people, their modes of life, facilities for intercommunica tion, means of subsistence, &c, as would be of advantage to a military leader operating in these regions. The other three divisions are readily understood from their designa- tions This institution has among its purposes the collecting, preserving, and elaborating the elements of military science, and historical data concern-"], [217, "209 PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. ing the operations of armies, the preparation of information for the enlight enment of the command, the perfection of military instruction, and the furnishing of officers with subjects for reflection and study. The state survey is, then, a practically independent branch of the above extensive institution. It was found necessary on account of the increase of the purely mili tary duties of the chief of the General Staff to appoint a separate chief of the state survey. CHIEF OF THE STATE SURVEY. He is subordinate to the chief of the General Staff, from whom he receives all orders pertaining to the General Staff, and in regard to the execution of the decisions of the central office. He stands in the same relation towards his subordinates as the chief of the General Staff to its different branches. He has charge of the executive, discipline, technical work, and the expenditure of the appropriation for the state survey. The chiefs of the three divisions under his charge (the trigonometric, topographic, and cartographic), regulate the work in their respective divis ions and are responsible for the same; the chief of the state survey, con trolling the whole, harmonizes the working of the divisions and distributes the force and material for the best advantage of the whole. Force, appropriation, dc. \u2014 The force of the royal Prussian state sur vey is given herewith : Officers : 1 chief of the state survey (a major-general) 3 chiefs of division. 14 staff officers and captains to conduct surveys 1 adjutant. 28 detailed lieutenants. Superior officials : 2 chiefs of survey parties and 1 superintendent cf publications. 1 inspector of the map archives. Technical force: (a) Permanent officials (fixed yearly pay): 51 trigonometers, topographers, and cartographers. 3 technical inspectors. 1 chief of printing. 1 chief photographer. 1366 WH 14"], [218, "210 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Technical force \u2014 Continued. 17 copper engravers and lithographers. 8 printers, including foreman. 1 photographer. 1 assistant lithographer. (b) Temporary officials (paid by the month, week, or day): 106 assistant trigonometers, topographers, and cartographers. 1 galvano-plastic assistant, 4 engravers, and 1 lithographer. 10 technical assistants. Clerks, messengers, and laborers: (a) Permanent employes: 1 accountant. 6 registers. 4 secretaries. 4 messengers. 4 janitors. 3 watchmen and porters. 2 firemen. (b) Temporary employes : 4 assistant clerks. Embracing \u2014 47 officers, 208 technical employes, 30 clerks, laborers, &c, in all, 285. The officers belong to the General Staff, with the exception of the 28 de tailed lieutenants, who are carried on the rolls of their regiments as detailed, and receive an extra compensation out of the appropriation for the survey, and while in the field a regular mileage and per diem compensation. Note. \u2014 Officers of the general staff who have served in the topographic division generally gain advantages as to promotion npon returning to their respective commands. The Great General Staff of the Prussian army is composed of two branches, the \" Haupt Etat\" and the \" Neben fitat,\" the latter for scientific purposes. Positions in the latter, as well as those connected with the survey (\"Landes- Aufnahme\") are only filled hy officers who have seen active service in the army, and never by persons taken directly from civil life. Generally civilians are only eligible to the positions of lithographers and engravers in the cartographic division, the main body of technical officials having previously served in the army for several enlistments. The greater proportion of the officers transferred to the General Staff are those who have passed through the War Academy (a school for officers) with distinc tion, which affords a guarantee of the maintenance and development of the scientific element. The War Academy (\" Kriegs Academic\") is intended for those officers only who, \"after having acquired elementary knowledge iu other establishments, desire to increase and perfect the same in every province of the art of war, in order to gain the necessary skill for the higher and extraordinary demands ofthe service.\"' It is only until lately that officers ordered to the topographic survey had not graduated at this academy."], [219, "211 PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. From among these officers six are selected to conduct trigonometric and five for topographic surveying parties ; these officers are not retained in this position longer than about three years, that they may not be estranged from their regular army duties. The technical employe's are appointed and promoted according to their merits and general efficiency, with the exception of the assistant trigonom eters, topographers, and cartographers, who are required to show a service of nine years in the army and as assistants in the state survey to be pro moted to trigonometers, topographers, and cartographers in accordance with their time of service, while their compensation is regulated by the date of their employment in the state survey. . The inspector-general of artillery details a number of sergeants, also other commanders of troops (non-commissioned officers), for these positions as assistant trigonometers, &c. They are continued on the rolls of the army, but are entirely paid by the state survey, and allowed to wear citi zens' clothes ; they receive, while in the field, mileage and per diem com pensation, as do the civil employes, and are afterwards entitled to a position in the civil service of the Government. To be employed as bureau offi cial, or clerk or in one of the lower positions, it is necessary to possess a certificate entitling one to an office in the civil service of the Government, received in consequence of long and faithful service in the regular army. For promotion, it requires the necessary qualifications All aforementioned permanent employe's are appointed by the Secre tary of War on the recommendation of the chief of the state survey and with the advice of the chief of the General Staff, and range in accordance with the date of appointment regarding their compensation. All assistants are employed by the chief of the state survey on the recommendation of a chief of division, and are employed by and can leave or be discharged from month to month. The appropriation for the fiscal year 1885-6 was 1,1 16,500 marks. This money, in charge of the chief of the state survey and deposited with the funds of the army, is expended by a commission of three, namely, (1) chief of division, (2) the adjutant, and (3) the accountant."], [220, "212 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. In addition to this there had to be appropriated the following sums : Marks. For extra pay for the officers 175, 864 For commutation for quarters for all entitled to the same . 57, 600 i For office ofthe central supervision ofthe state survey, according to act ofthe German Parliament: Appropriations, cap. 22, tit, 8-12 17, 610 Appropriations, cap. 25 and 27, for rations and extra pay for heads of bureaus 1, 860 Total 19, 470 This last amount is in charge of the chief of the General Staff, as pre- siding officer of the central office. The total amount of 1,369,434 marks appears in the appropriation bills of the German Parliament ; but in consideration that this work has been carried to a higher order than the purely military interest of the empire de mands, and it being so extended as to incur the expenses for a great num ber of civil employes and it mostly being in the interest and for the benefit of the state of Prussia, therefore this country has to reimburse the German Empire to the amount of 800,000 marks per annum as long as the survey continues under its present organization. The German Empire, whose military interest is also greatly benefited by the survey, assumes the balance, together with occasional deficiencies, the amount of pensions for retired employe's, and the expenses for the office building, just finished ; but, on the other hand, receiving all money accru ing from the sale of maps, &c, and other published results of the survey, which are given by contract to booksellers and publishers ; these last-named transactions being in charge of the inspector of maps and chief of the state survey. The following are the divisions : (1) TRIGONOMETRIC DIVISION. The force consists of 1 chief, 6 chiefs of surveying districts, 1 chief of the editorial section, 8 detailed officers, 26 trigonometers and assistants, 3 registers and office clerks. This division establishes a system of triangles over the whole state, by determining a number of points in regard to their horizontal and vertical relations with such degree of correctness as time and means permit."], [221, "PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 213 This system of triangles constitutes the basis for all military and eco nomic maps and surveys, and the triangles are so compacted as to allow the establishment of ten trigonometric points to each square mile (German). These are securely marked by stone monuments, and embrace also all prominent points, as spires, chimneys, &c. The work is then continued from this primary triangulation to a sec ondary, tertiary, &c, and thence to the detail survey. The system of main triangles is observed with the greatest care and correctness and with the best instruments, the sides averaging about eight German (37.44 English) miles in length. Within this triangulation of the first order one of the second order is constructed, the sides of the former being the bases for the latter, the sides of its triangles to be reduced to about 1 \\ German miles. Within these two again a more detailed triangulation, with the points of the third and fourth order, is introduced to such an extent that the above-mentioned number of points to tlie square mile is determined. To preserve these points, established with so much labor and expense, the laws of October 7, 1865, and April 7, 1869, were enacted. These laws transfer to the state the ground around each monument to the extent of two square meters, for which the owner is compensated. The monuments of the first, second, and third order consist of a granite slab, 3 feet square, in the center of which are cut two cross-lines. This stone lies 3 feet under the surface of the surrounding ground, on top of which is placed a stone column, 3 feet high, smooth and square on the top, with like cross-lines cut in the center, this cross lying in a vertical line through the lower one, thus indicating the correct trigonometric point. A preliminary reconnaissance is made for the selection of points prior to the commencement of the principal triangulation. The topography is usually commenced the second year after the com pletion of the tertiary triangulation. Eight years are required from the date of the ordering of the work until the issue of the final map, as follows: First year. Reconnaissance for the main triangulation. Second. Main triangulation observations. Third. Ob servations for secondary triangulation. Fourth. Tertiary triangulation."], [222, "214 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Fifth. Preparation for topographic survey. Sixth. The topographic survey. Seventh. Issue of lithographed plane-table sheets. Eighth. The issue of topographic map (scale 1:100,000) and man\u0153uver maps. The computation is made by the most correct formul\u00e6 known to sci ence, with the introduction of the method of least squares. The probable error, if more than 1:100,000, in the length of the side of a triangle of the first order excludes the result. Leveling and determination of altitudes. \u2014 The basis for ascertaining altitudes is by direct leveling, geometric methods being used since 1867, in place of the trigonometric methods theretofore employed. On account of the greater accuracy of the former they are designated as levels of precision, and are determined by means of level telescopes .and leveling rods. These telescopes are sufficiently powerful to permit of reading in a clear atmosphere the millimeters on the rod at a distance of 75 meters. Belt lines of leveling having an average circumference of 300 kilome ters (185 miles) are followed. All trigonometric points included within these belts and not more than 2 kilometers from fixed points on the main road lines are connected with these by geometric levels, and the last-named, points serve to determine the altitude of all others inside the poly conic belt by trigonometric measurement. The zero point for altitude was the level of the sea, having been called absolute altitude, until it was discovered through a system of precision levels, which included all tide levels on the coast of the Baltic from the city of Memel to Ekernforde, that the surface of this sea, though showing the usual rise and fall, is not identical with any other level surface on the globe. Therefore a bench mark was established on one of the observing piers at the Berlin observatory, designated as -f 37 meters, and is known as the normal zero point; the correct zero point 37 meters below it differing very little from mean sea level. Lastly, it is the duty of the trigonometric division to collect the com putation of its observers, arranging it for the use of the topographers and for publication, and to make this material accessible for all branches ofthe Government, for other Governments and the public."], [223, "215 PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. The organization of this division is as follows : Section I. \u2014 Office and register of the chief, care of instruments and vehicles, the correspondence in regard to the transfer and title of ground surrounding monuments. II. \u2014 Principal triangulation. III. \u2014 Triangulation of the second order. IV. \u2014 Detail triangulation. V. \u2014 Levels. VI. \u2014 Publications, archives, and library, (2) TOPOGRAPHICAL DIVISION. The force consists of 1 chief, 5 chiefs of surveying districts, 20 detailed lieuten ants, 79 topographers and assistants, 3 registers and office clerks. The work assigned to this division is a topographic survey of at least 200 square (German) miles per annum of the country, prepared by the trigonometric division. This survey, at a scale of 1:25,000, has to contain all material of im portance in either a military or economic sense. The projection is the same as for former surveys, polyhedric (poly edrische). Each plane-table sheet contains 10 minutes of latitude and 6 of longitude. Inside of this space the curvature of the earth's surface is not considered, but the same regarded as a level. The 2^ square miles embraced by each plane-table sheet has to con tain, according to order, 10 points to the square mile, or about 22 for the whole sheet, these trigonometric points being marked by stone monuments, and are so located as to allow the placing of the surveying instrument exactly over the trigonometric point, and to take bearings of at least one other trigonometric point therefrom, thus rendering any further triangulation by the topographer unnecessary. To these, all other promiuent trigono metric points, designated as points of the fourth order, are added, as spires, chimneys, &c, which swells the number on the plane-table sheet some times to 32-34. The altitude of all these points is also determined. Contour lines are drawn as a rule for every 5 meters, but for plain parts ofthe country intermediate lines may be inserted at 2\u00a3 and 1\u00a3 meters whenever the formation of the country requires it, while in rocky parts only"], [224, "216 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. so many contour lines are given as is necessary to show the character of the elevations without crowding the drawing. In the general topographic map (scale 1:100,000), as is true also for similar map series of other countries, it being impossible to delineate correctly by the scale the smaller dimensions, conventional signs are em ployed, varying in their minor but quite uniform in their major details, while in some instances legends of distances, geographical positions, azi muths, and elevations are added, proving an advantage to the student or reader of the map. The topographic field work is done by 5 surveying parties in charge of captains, with a force of 80 surveyors (20 lieutenants and 60 topogra phers and assistants) and a reserve of 5 men in case of sickness, &c. Two hundred square miles to be surveyed annually gives to every sur veyor 2.5 square miles, or somewhat more than one plane-table sheet. These finished plane-table sheets are reproduced at the same scale, 1:25,000, by means of lithography for publication, and used in compiling the degree map at a scale of 1:100,000. For the purpose of preserving the originals, photographic copies are taken and used by the draughtsmen and lithographers. It is also the duty of the topographic division to make, besides these new and original surveys, corrections of older surveys which have not been kept up with the time, but are of importance in the interest of the State, by reconnaissances. These corrections are mainly lines of communication, as roads, railroads, &c, ranges of mountains and smaller elevations, the last named to complete the hypsometric system of squares. The work of this division for the winter time consists in preparing for the field work of the next summer. This includes the preparing of 90-100 plane-table sheets, the projections for the same, and the locating of 30 trigo nometric points for each, or 3,000 for all. The office work is arranged as follows : Section I. \u2014 Register and office of the chief. \" 1 1.\u2014 Preparations for field work ; care of the instruments, archives aud library. \" III. \u2014 Reconnaissances. \" IV to VIII. \u2014 Five surveying divisions from A to E."], [225, "217 PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. (3) CARTOGRAPHIC DIVISION. The force consists of 1 chief; 2 officers and 1 civil employs, as directors ; 52 car tographers and assistants, 3 tech nical inspectors, 1 chief of printing, 1 chief photographer, 1 photographer, 6 copper engravers, 12 lithographers, 8 printers, 1 electrotyper, 10 technical assistants, 3 registers and clerks. The work assigned to this division is the production of correct maps, based on the work of the trigonometric and topographic divisions of the state survey, and to keep these maps current with all new material. The cartographic division uses the collected material of the topo graphic survey for the following authorized publications : 1. Map of the state of Prussia at a scale of 1 : 25,000. This map consists mainly in a reproduction of the plane-table sheets by means of lithography; photographic copies of the original are furnished for the work. The more important sections are done by lithographers reg ularly employed; the others are given in contract to prominent lithographic establishments. The publication of these plane-table sheets is principally in the interest of state economy. The scale of 1:25,000 still shows the cultivation ofthe country, and the contour lines furnish a base for all contemplated improve ments, as roads, railroads, canals, irrigation, geological researches, forest culture, &c. For military purposes at great man\u0153uvers the scale of these maps is too large, and the representation of the elevations of the country by means of contour lines not so favorable and comprehensive as by means of ha en uring, for which reason extra sheets with hachures are issued. 2. The degree map at a scale of 1: 100,000. This being a purely military map of the state of Prussia, the scale of 1:100,000 was decided on as the best, it being possible at this scale to represent everything of importance in a military map, and keep the same in convenient size to overlook at a glance. The 200 square miles annually surveyed form twelve complete sections; to these are added three sections of reconnaissance, making in all about fifteen sections to be annually engraved."], [226, "218 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The degree map includes at present only Prussia, with such parts of other states as are inclosed by the Prussian territory. The following states are not included in this map: Saxony, Bavaria (including Pfalz), and Wurtemberg. Saxony possesses a map nearly identical with the Prussian map, only differing in regard to the zero, this one being established at the astronomi cal observatory at Leipsic. The acknowledged necessity for a military map of the whole German Empire, at a scale of 1 : 100,000, resulted in a convention of representatives of Prussia, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, and Saxony in 1878 The conclusions arrived at were as follows: (a) To make and issue a map of the whole German Empire at the same scale as the Prussian state survey map, namely, 1:100,000. The work to be done by the combined forces of the above-mentioned states, namely, the General Staffs of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and the Topographico Statisti cal Bureau of Wurtemberg. (b) The projection is tbe same as used for the maps of Prussia and Saxony, polyhedric (polyedrische), lougitude and latitude referriug to Berliu (observatory). The sections ofthe map, representing Bavaria, Saxony, and Wurtemberg, showing on the edge the difference between their own and the longitude and latitude of Berliu. (c) As a rule, every oue of these four states furnishes the full sections of their own territory, the boundary or connecting sections to be done by the state whose territory occupies the greatest space of the same. (d) The sections are numbered in regular order, but each section is named after the largest city situated in its limits and belonging to the German Empire. Prussia assumes for the smaller states all work of a military character for which it is indemnified out of the common treasury of the German Empire; therefore, the sections covered by these states are issued by Prussia. 3. A further duty of this division consists in the work of issuing all maps of a military character, and especially such as are of importance to the General Staff; to the last named belong the so-called mau\u0153uver maps, generally at a scale of 1:50,000, to be used at the annual autumn man\u0153uvers. 4. And last, the very difficult work of keeping the existing maps current with the material furnished by new surveys, &c. Two annexations to the cartographic division may be mentioned, which serve to make this division independent of private enterprises, namely : (a) The printing establishment: Eight printers, with eight assistants, do all plate and lithographic printing, ar also the printing of circulars, blanks, field and account books, &c."], [227, "219 PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. (b) A photographic establishment: In charge of a chief photographer, he being a well-trained and scientific man; his duty is to make the very lately organized establishment a model by observing and making the best use of all new inventions. The stereotyper of the division belongs to this branch. The office is divided into sections, as follows: Section I. \u2014 Office and register ofthe chief, archives, and library. \" II. \u2014 Drawing of the map at a scale of 1:100,000 (degree map). \" III. \u2014 Section for the issue of the state map, at a scale of 1 : 25,000.

Prior to 1874 the area annually surveyed was 80 German square miles. It is estimated that thirty years from 1870 will be required for the comple tion ofthe entire work, or until 1900. Heliogravure is now being introduced. The publications other than maps consist of professional papers on degree measurement, levels, triangu lations, elevations, topography, &c. The maps are for sale to the public at very reasonable rates at a number of Government agencies. As a result, Prussia contributes 544 sheets; Saxony, 30; Bavaria, 80; and Wurtemberg 20, making the total of 674 sheets. The borders of the sheets are parallels of thirty minutes and meridians of fifteen minutes apart, The size of the paper is 19 inches X 16.35 inches, and of the part covered by topography at the latitude of 52\u00b0 X., approx imately 13.5 inches X 10.75 inches, representing 370 German square miles, or approximately 7,000 square statute miles. Description of sheet, scale 1:100,000. The relief is expressed by Muffling's system (broken and wavinghachures) for slopes of 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0, and Lehman's system (full straight-line hachures,"], [228, "220 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. normal to horizontal curve, varying in thickness according to declivity) for more abrupt ground. A great number of elevations, given in meters, have as a point of departure the normal zero established at the observatory at Berlin. The mean level of the Baltic Sea at Eckernforde, at the mouth of the Pregel, is 0m.34 below the normal zero. The limits of the administrative district are colored, and, instead of placing on the sheet the name of the district, a little ellipse, tinted in the interior with the same color as the border of the limit, bears a number re produced below the border. The sheets, embracing sea-coasts, give the soundings in meters and curves, indicating the zones of depths of 2, 4, 6, and 10 meters. The basis of the map is printed in black and the waters in blue colors. Description of sheet, scale 1:25,000. Each sheet comprises 10' in longitude and 6' in latitude, embracing approximately the area of 45 square miles for an average sheet. The size of the drawing (a reproduction of a field plane-table sheet) at the latitude of 51\u00b0 30' N. is 18.15 inches horizontal by 17.35 inches vertical dimension, printed on paper 23.5 inches X 22.3 inches. Two scales are given below the border, one in kilometers and another in geographical miles. Connected horizontal curves at equidistances of 5 meters (each fourth curve drawn heavier) cover the entire area, each curve of 10 meters being marked at the extremity reaching the interior border line. Where declivities are expressed by hachures, forty are employed for each 3 centimeters (1.18 English inches), which vary from 5\u00b0 of slope up to 45\u00b0, the ratio of the black line to its immediate blank space appearing as j^o , % denoting the declivity. The size of inhabited places, cultivated fields, forests, reservoirs, &c, are shown. Canals, limits of administrative departments, rail and common roads and other routes or lines of communication, &c, are laid down. The sheet is known by its number in the index map, as also the name of the principal town which it contains. It is, in fact, a faithful and artistic"], [229, "PRUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 221 reproduction by lithography of the plane-table sheet, revised and perfected by the addition of special elevations and distances. Elevations are occa sionally written along the curves. The names of the four adjacent sheets are given along the borders. The base is printed in black and the water in blue. For a sheet of the 1:25,000 chart the surface embraced by one de gree of geographical latitude and longitude is divided into sixty parts, each of which embraces ten minutes in longitude and six minutes in latitude. The size of such sheet thus varies according to latitude, and in Germany fluctuates between 1.9 and 2.7 geographical square miles and embraces on an average 2.3 geographical square miles. The office of the survey pub lishes yearly about 100 of these sheets, covering an area of, say, 230 square German miles, or 43,516 square statute miles. Hand engraving on copper plate has so far been employed for the map of 1 : 100,000, as well as for those on the scale of 1 : 50,000. The sheets (scale 1 : 25,000) are produced by lithography on stone, and the Reymann chart (scale 1 : 200,000), heretofore reproduced by copper engraving, is at present published by the heliogravure process, in which experiments are being made with a view to its more general introduction. Campaign maps are rapidly printed from photolithographic transfers. The annual cost, derived from the \"budget,\" which receives the approval of the Reichstag, is 1,200,000 marks* ($300,000 approximately), divided as follows: (1) for the field 400,000 marks, (increased by the salaries of officers), and (2) for the office 800,000 marks. The cost of the trigonometric branch from 1865 to 1877, inclusive, was 2,738,761 marks (approximately $684,690), or at the rate of approxi mately $57,000 per annum, while for the trigonometric, topographic, and cartographic divisions from 1877 to April 1, 1881 (4 years), the amount actually expended was 4,011,957 marks (approximately $1,002,975), or approximately $250,075 per year. A general estimate ofthe present cost per German square mile for (1) triangulation, (2) topography, (3) carto graphy, was for the first 1,900 marks (approximately $475), for the second \"This had increased to 1,369,434 marks in 1885."], [230, "222 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 2,400 (approximately 8600),* and for the third 1,700 marks (approximately $450), or at the rates respectively per square statute mile of approximately (1) $25, (2) $31.70, and (3) $23.75, or at the total rate of approximately $80 per square statute mile for the production of this special map. The above amount would be increased by payments made from the military budget, and is in excess of all expenditures (for maps of various scales) made prior to 1872. Prussia had finished 395 sections of the 674 sheet map in July, 1885, at which date Saxony had completed sixteen, Bavaria six, and Wurtemberg none. \u25a0 \u2022 So far as known, no other branch of the Prussian state government at Berlin or that of United Germany issues topographic maps, except the topographic bureau proper (state survey of the general staff establishment). Until latterly the Department of Commerce issued general maps, pos sessed of orographic details and the Finance Ministry, charged with the ca dastral survey for revenue, have doubtless their own charts, but I have not been able to examine them if there are such. The map of the De partment of Commerce (1868 to 1875) was on the scale 1:25,000.

This office has an annual revenue of about 50,000 marks (approximately $12,500) from the sale of maps, wliich can be purchased by agents recognized directly by the Government or through almost any prominent bookseller. The main positions are determined with a high order of accuracy both as regards field observations and subsequent computations, while the intro duction of the improved plane-table processes leaves nothing to be desired as regards the appearance of the original sheets and their accuracy (no error being appreciable upon the drawing at the scale employed), but want ing simply in that storehouse of practical detail (for both present and future use), resulting from the measurements from traverse lines and by offsets and of the actual lines of boundaries, large and small, natural and artificial which however should naturally be supplemented by a proper cadastral survey The original archives are permanently in the custody of this branch of the war department, and available for future reference, and found where needed when the war arm of the Government has to be brought in requisi tion. It is believed that the general staff survey, now carried on with so much precision and system, answers all the wants of the Government as regards both general and detailed topographic maps, and hence, with the exception of the planimetric charts of the finance department, now issues all the general and special maps upon which orographical details appear, while at the same time the geological service avails of these as the ground work of geological representation. The present cadastral survey of Prussia, under the ministry of finance, was established by law of May 21, 1861, which nullified all hitherto exist ing regulations. There had been employed up to the time the new law was to take effect (January 1, 1865,) no less than 14 different systems and 100 kinds of cadastral maps. During the French occupation (up to 1815), when the Rhenish- Westphalian Provinces were re-ceded by France to Prussia, a cadastral survey was in progress, and was continued by Prussia under sub stantially the same rules and regulations with modifications adopted in 1819. This cadastral work was completed between 1818 and 1834, in all, 843.5"], [232, "224 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. (German) square miles, or 53 (German) square miles per year, at a total expense of 4,148,617 thalers. The following scales were employed: for large districts, 1:50,000; parishes, 1:10,000 and 1:20,000; private proper ties, 1:2,500, 1:1,250; and 1:625 for towns, villages, and hamlets. The cadastral survey of Hanover had no definite organization up to 1861; even up to 1856 an examination of surveyors was not deemed nec essary. The first surveys in Hesse-Cassel commenced in the sixteenth century The first cadastre law of 1764 was the basis of the regulations of the final statutes of 1833 which contkmed in operation up to 1866. Scales: for gen eral maps, 1:1,500; for villages, 1:750; for forests, 1:3,000. Not less than 11 different measures for length and 20 square measures had been used in the surveys of \u00a3.chleswig-Hol stein, the errors and confusion arising therefrom being evident. Nassau and the free city of Frankfort had their own spe cial cadastral surveys, the laws of the latter dating back to 1611. On the 1st of January, 1872, the adoption of the new measure of the empire entered in force. Up to 1861 there had been survej^ed by the existing cadastre in the six eastern provinces 70,856,136 morgen (45,639,466 acres) at the following scales: Per cent, of the entire survey ed and mapped area.

The condition of measurement of arcs of great circles falling within Germany receives attention in the publications of the Geodetic Institute under General Baeyer, as well as all of those arcs where the measurements are of an international character. GEODETIC INSTITUTE OF PRUSSIA AND EUROPEAN DEGREES MEASUREMENTS. The Geodetic Institute at Berlin (under the administration of the Min istry for Spiritual, Educational, and Medical Affairs) executes base measure ments, trigonometric connections, astronomical observations, determinations of polar co-ordinates, leveling and tidal observations for determining the relative levels of the European seas and comparison of measurements, as well as the functions of the \" Central Bureau of the European Degrees Measurements.\" The following translated from \"On the origin of the European Degrees Measurements \" (Zur Entstehungsgeschichte der Europaischen Gradver messung) bears upon the origin, organization, and functions of this Central Bureau. The first degree measurement in Europe was made in 1525 by the Pa risian physician and mathematician, Fernel, between Paris and Amiens. Since then men of science have continually devoted themselves to the determination of the figure and dimensions of the earth. For this purpose great operations had been undertaken in the eighteenth century by France, and in the nineteenth century by England and Russia. The following degree measurements have been made in Europe up to 1861: Two great and three small arcs of meridian and three arcs of parallels. The latitude measurements are : 1. The great French -Ed glisk arc of meridian from the Balearic to the Shetland Islands (from Formentera to Saxavord), extending over 22 degrees in latitude. 2. The great Russian-Scandinavian arc of meridian, beginning near Ismail, on the Danube, and ending at Hammerfest, near the Arctic Ocean ; extending over 25\u00a3 degrees of latitude. 1366 WH 15"], [234, "226 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 3. Three small arcs of meridian iu Central Europe, viz: In Hanover, between Gottingen and Altona, 2\u00b0 V longitude ; in Denmark, between* Lauenburg and Lyssabel, 1\u00b0 32' longitude; and in Prussia, between Trunz and Memel, 1\u00b0 30' longitude. The first longitude measurement along the parallel from the mouth of the river Gironde, in France, via Turin, Milan to Fiume, was executed by France, Piedmont, and Austria. The second, between Brest and Strassburg, was begun in 181^, andr after many interruptions, only lately completed. The third, proposed in 1857 by W. Struve, was executed by 'Russia,. Prussia, Belgium, and England ; it extends from Orsk in the Ural, in Russia, to the west coast of Ireland, 77 degrees in longitude. This arc is over 600 German miles in length and is the greatest ever measured in the world ; this measurement will decide the interesting ques tion whether the curvature of that arc is that of a segment of a circle or the segment of another curve. Other degree measurements have also been undertaken by France, in Peru and Lapland, and by England, in the East Indies and at the Cape of Good Hope. All these extensive and costly operations have been solely undertaken to determine the figure and dimensions of the earth. But these latitude and longitude degrees measurements have been ex ecuted independently one of another ; in the new degree measurement pro posed, both kinds of operations, .. e., longitude and latitude measurements,. will be connected in such a manner as to demonstrate the curvature of the earth surface in any or all directions. This is the task which the Central European degrees measurements has to accomplish. Central Europe contains very elaborate material in its exten sive triangulations, and the connecting chains of triangles, stretching over Sweden and Norway, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, furnish the most desirable material for the accomplishment of a degree measure ment which shall fully meet present scientific requirements. The area embraced between the meridians of the observatory at Bonn and Trunz (the southern end point of Bessels degree measurement) and:"], [235, "227 PRUSSIA\u2014 DEGREES MEASUREMENTS. between the parallels of Palermo and Christiania* represent an area of over 12\u00b0 jf longitude and of nearly 22\u00b0 of latitude, equal to about 38,000 Ger man square miles. More than 30 observatories are located within this area; they are all provided with excellent instruments and competent observers and thus offer inducements and facilities nowhere else to be found in any other part of equal extent in the world. Within this area more than 10 arcs of meridians at different longi tudes and a still greater number of parallels at different latitudes can be measured. General Baeyer's project, the \"degrees measurements\" of Central Eu rope, was sanctioned by the Prussian Government June 20, 1861, and the office of foreign affairs instructed to invite all those states of Central Europe lying within the area of the proposed operations to participate in the under taking, and if agreeable to appoint proper persons for the execution of the work. General Baeyer was appointed representative of Prussia, with whom those of the other states should communicate. All states invited consented to take part in the operation. The central bureau was established at Berlin, with General Baeyer at its head. DIVISION OF THE WORK. The proposed work is divided into three classes, viz : 1. Work executed by the several members (commissioners) in their own countries, as : Examination and sifting of material on hand ; verifica tion of a unit of measure ; execution of triangles to fill gaps, if such exist, or to replace old triangulations of defective character ; computation of polar co-ordinates between astronomically determined points ; measurements of polar altitudes, azimuths, pendulum observations, and telegraphic longitude differences. 2. Work which the commissioners of one state execute in conjunction with the commissioners of adjacent states, as connections of chains of tri- * Prof. Hansteen, of Christiania, proposed an extension northward to Drontheim."], [236, "228 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. angles, adjustment of differences; computation of polar co-ordinates be tween determined points in their own country with points in adjoining states ; measurements of telegraphic longitudes, differences between the same, &c. 3. All such work as can be undertaken by joint operations on a large scale. \u2022 The practical scientists appointed by the several Governments as com missioners, and who are charged with the execution of the work indepen dently in their respective countries, send annually special reports to the central bureau, by which the results are compiled, printed, and published. The first general conference was called by General Baeyer for October 15, 1864, to meet at Berlin. He submitted the following points for the deliberation and action of the conference : 1. Regulation of units of measure in cases where direct comparison is impossible. 2. Adjustment of errors in the connection of triangle chains and transfer of azimuths. 3. Determination of limits of errors in polar azimuth and telegraphic longitude observations. 4. The grouping of points, the astronomical determination of which is most desirable. 5. Determination of intensity of gravity. 6. Astronomic and geodetic, polar co-ordinates. 7. Levelings, and regulation of absolute heights. 8. Miscellaneous matter, i. e., bureau work, theoretical investiga tions, &c. ORGANIZATION OF THE CENTRAL BUREAU. The business of the bureau is twofold. 1. INTERNATIONAL MATTERS. According to the action of the general conference, the central bureau is the executive organ of the commission."], [237, "PRUSSIA\u2014 DEGREES MEASUREMENTS. 229 Its functions are as follows : 1. It receives the annual reports of the representatives of the several States participating in the degree measurement. 2 It submits these reports, with comments thereon, to the permanent commission for examination and criticism. 3. After the rendition of opinions by the permanent commission, the reports are returned to the central bureau, by which the same are compiled into a general report for publication. 4. It conducts under the control of the permanent commission all work necessary in regard to unification of geodetic and astronomical measure ments. 5. It is charged with the administration of the archives, library, and material collected by the central European degrees measurements. 2. NATIONAL MATTERS. It is charged with the execution and calculations of Struve's and of central European degrees measurements, so far as they fall to the share of Prussia. 1. The execution of scientific triangulations, conditioned by the de grees measurements; polar altitude and azimuth observations and levelings. 2. Measurements of differences of longitudes between principal points of the geodetic net. 3. Observations of intensity of gravity on all necessary points. 4. All necessary computations. It is also the duty of the central bureau to keep itself instructed in all scientific questions which may present themselves in this field, and as the organ of the permanent commission and head of the central European degrees measurements, it must have constantly in view the theoretical as well as the practical development of science, and it must be competent to meet promptly and efficiently all demands which the general conference in their transactions, relating to astronomical and geodetic questions, may put to the central bureau."], [238, "230 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The personnel, of the central bureau consists of three members, viz: General Baeyer, president. Professor Focrster and Dr. Bremiker. Four permanent assistants, which number may be increased if needed, One clerk and one messenger. Note. \u2014 So far as may be ascertained from published reports already received, the results ofthe oper ations of the International Commission, through the central office at Berlin, has been confined princi pally to measurements of arcs of meridian and parallel, gravity determinations, and the precise deter minations and comparisons of elevations. It claims to have proven with great certainty (see \"Report on the Progress and Work of the European Degrees Measurements,\" by Prof. Th. von Oppolzer, of Vienna, in the Geographical Year Book for 1884, by Herman Wagner, Gotha, 1885, p. 119) that the levels of tbe different seas or oceans of Europe are not at the same horizontal plane in their mean water stages. These differences have been found, however, in no case to exceed one meter. General Baeyer gathered the material necessary for the study of the differences, referring all levels to the mean sea level of the Baltic at Swinemiinde. The most important data, which may yet undergo revision from more extended comparisons, are as follows: M. I. Baltic at Swinemiinde above the Mediterranean at Marseilles (across Switzerland) +0. 664 II. North Sea at Amsterdam above the Mediterranean at Marseilles +0. 757 III.

The Kingdom of Saxony (possessed of an area of 5,787 square miles, with a population of 2,970,220 in 1880, or an average of 513 per square mile) is engaged in the preparation and completion of a topographic map (with curves alone, and also with colored \"terrain\") of its territory on the scale of 1 : 25,000 in 156 sheets, and contributes also the data for 30 sheets of the general topographic map of Germany (scale 1 : 100,000 \u2014 674 sheets). The preparation of this special chart (1 : 25,000) is intrusted to"], [239, "231 SAXONY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. the Topographic Bureau of the Saxon General Staff of the War Ministry at Dresden, under Major-General Holleben, chief of the General Staff. The personnel of the bureau consists of \u2014 1 director. 1 to 2 officers. 2 geographical engineers. 12 to 15 topographers. In October, 1880, Dr. Ruge read a paper before the Geographical Soci ety at Dresden, on Saxon Cartography and the Land Surveys of the six teenth Century, prepared from data found among the state archives, from which it appears that the oldest map of any part of Saxony then discovered was of the district of Schwarzenberg, by George Oder, date 1531, scale (ap proximately) 1 : 26,000. The elector, August, appears to have encouraged the land survey, wliich, from 1550 to 1600, was exclusively made by the \"Oder\" family. The elector, however, attempted to prevent the publication of special maps of his country, a practice almost universally observed in Europe until far into the eighteenth century. This is proven by the fate of Scultetus of Gorlitz, who attempted to publish a map of the electorate in 1569, and also, Joh. Griginger, rector of Marienberg, who, only after tedious negotiations, was permitted to publish a map of Saxony, at Prague, in 1568. This was the first printed map of Saxony, the original not yet having been discov ered, but Ortelius had copied and reproduced it in his collection, and it con stituted, for over 200 years, the basis on wliich all maps of Saxony were reproduced. (See \" Registrande11 1881.) As early as 1781 the triangulation was begun, and followed by detail surveys in 1785. These were made and completed to the scale of 1:12,000, each original sheet of 24 Dresden inches, representing 1 square mile. The guiding principle of this work was to make the information available the earliest possible. In 1819 the publication of a Topographic Atlas of Saxony (scale 1:57,600, in 24 sheets), based upon the foregoing, to be engraved on copper, was ordered. This atlas, the originals of wliich were still employed on revision work remaining uncorrected, has been withdrawn from the market. In 1861 the Topographical Bureau was"], [240, "232 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. directed to publish a topographic map of Saxony (scale 1:100,000, in 28 sheets), principally for military purposes. The engraving was on copper, a few were published in outline without hills, and the others as \"terrain\" maps with hills (Lehman's system modified to 60\u00b0 black), on the de L'lsle projection. The road map has been discontinued and the \"terrain\" map, properly revised, is now used for the Saxon quota of the general German map, same scale. The old original sheets of the Saxon land survey, scale 1 : 12,000, are used as a basis for the topographic chart (scale 1 : 25,000) for the territory of Saxony entire. That part of the Austrian domain shown on the map is transferred from the photographs furnished by the Royal Imperial Military Geographical Institute (Vienna), (scale 1 : 28,800), and where new surveys of the Prus sian and Altenburger territory are made, the system of the Prussian Gen eral Staff survey (scale 1:25,000) is followed. All the planimetry is supplemented by a plane-table survey, brought up to the required standard, while, moreover, the forest charts of the Ro}^al Saxon Forest Commission, prepared on a very large scale, are used, and for cities and village sites the special detailed charts prepared on a similar scale. The accurate representation to the scale of 1 : 25,000 has the security resulting from work done upon the ground on a much larger scale than that of the map, the only exception being that of the small areas, the detail of which has apparently been received from Austria, before the new or present survey of the Military Geographical Institute (scale 1 : 25,000) had reached the region in question. Determination of altitudes. \u2014 These are obtained by \u2014 (1) Levelings, (2) trigonometrically and (3) incidentally, by baro metric measures for points comparatively inaccessible, such, for instance, as cliffs overgrown with trees, where trigonometric and survey levelings can not easily be carried. The survey levelings follow the lines of that part of the European degree measurement, falling within Saxony, having a datum point on the Baltic Sea as a basis."], [241, "233 SAXONY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. The level stations are \"midway,\" thus eliminating (practically) curva ture and refraction, and are at slight intervals, so that the trigonometric measurements are not over distances greater than 500 to 600 meters, and hence can be simply calculated. The admissible error between two points 7,500 meters apart is fixed at 0.03. For the ten years ending December 31, 1881, the main levels have been carried over lines of (approximately) 5,000 German miles in length. The graphic transfer of the levels immediately follows their calculation. The trigonometric measures follow the graphic transfer of the level ings, the rule being to measure as small angles as possible, connecting be tween and checking upon level points. The observations are made by ver tical circles from Breithaupt & Son, Cassel (giving direct readings to 10 seconds), and universal instruments, by Starke & Kammerer, Vienna, the latter reading to 20 seconds. For the ten years to January 1, 1882, about 111,000 altitude points had been established in the above manner. The barometric measurements are restricted to the use of an aneroid barometer joined to parts determined by leveling, having the greatest pos sible difference of elevation, referring to the daily record of a second sta tionary aneroid. The index chart shows that 126 of the 156 sheets (scale 1 : 25,000) had been completed and published on July 1, 1885, that 16 were to be issued October 1, 1885, and that the remaining 14 sheets would be completed as early us April, 1886. Scale 1 : 25,000. \u2014 The approximate area of an average sheet (10' in longitude by 6' in latitude) is 51 statute square miles, the area covered by the topography on the sheet (paper 21| inches square) is 18.25 inches- by 17 inches at the latitude of 50\u00b0 30' to 50\u00b0 36' N. The planimetry is printed in black, the water and marshes in blue, and the contour lines in a reddish brown. Curves are at equidistances of 10 meters, also 5 and 2 J meters were necessary for level country (each fifth curve being stronger), with elevations marked at ends of each contour along the single border line. Border lines are not divided into parts of degrees for either latitude or longitude ; scale in kilometers ; elevations of marked points given. Each sheet is known by its number and name of principal locality. The"], [242, "234 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. number and names of each of tie four surrounding sheets are stated along the respective border lines. The various natural and artificial fea tures follow a legend of conventional signs. The only difference in the sheets with colored relief is in showing the nature of the slopes between contours by a brown, crayon tint, shaded according to the gradations of the Lehman system. The sheets do not close with the boundary of the king dom when reached, but are executed in full. The planimetry or outline of the map is engraved on copper, while the hydrographic part, the horizontals, and the relief coloring are litho graphed, and this map also forms the basis for the geological charts (begun in 1872), which latter, as well as the topographic sheets, are reproduced through the Royal Ministry of Finance. The printing is done directly from the copper plate, without any transfer upon stone, by Giesecke & Devrient, Leipsic. There are two editions: (I) with colored terrain, (II) without; the latter showing alone the planimetry, water, and curves. This special map was begun in 1872 ; it is expected that the last section will be published in April, 1886. It is believed that no other branch of the Saxon Government issues topographic maps. The original archives are the property of, and held in custody by, the War Ministry. The projection is after the \" De l'lsle\" system. Each sec tion is represented by a trapezoid, the parallel sides of which contains 10 minutes of latitude and the convergent sides 6 minutes in longitude. The belts of trapezoids extend from 50\u00b0 6' to 51\u00b0 30' N. latitude, and from 29\u00b0 30' to 32\u00b0 50' longitude east from the Isle of Ferro. There are 14 belts, comprising the 156 sections. In 1830 an estimate for a cadastral survey at a cost of approximately 800,000 thalers, requiring ten to twenty years for completion, was made. This being deemed too great by the representatives of the country, the use ofthe topographic plane-table survey (scale 1 : 12,000) was suggested as a base. Prior to the above date plane-table surveys based upon a trigono metric net had also been executed at scales 1 : 4,800 and 1 : 2,400."], [243, "BAVARIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 235 BAVARIA. Topographic. The General- Staff branch of the War Office of th 3 Kingdom of Bavaria has its own independent works, subject entirely to the administrative con trol of the Royal Government, the expense of which is defrayed purely from Bavarian funds. There has resulted a topographic map ofthe kingdom (scale 1 : 50,000 \u2014 110 sheets, complete, except for the revision of a few half sheets), and prog ress upon a special map (scale 1 : 25,000 \u2014 990 sheets), and data (iu pursu ance ofthe convention of 1878), is being furnished for 80 of the 674 sheets of the general topographic map of Germany (scale 1 : 100,000). A top ographic map of Southwest Germany has also been issued by this office on the scale of 1:250,000, in 25 sheets; a hypsometric map of Bavaria, scale 250,000, 16 sheets; also a hydrographic map of Bavaria (scale, 1 : 500,000). There are also maps of a purely military character for garri son, land-wehr and other administrative districts, for recruiting, reserve, and other uses and purposes. The Kingdom of Bavaria embraces 29,283 square miles of territory, with a population in 1880 of 5,271,516, or an average of 176 per square mile. The topographic surveys of this country are confided to the topo graphic bureau of the General Staff, under the War Ministry at Munich, with Colonel Charles von Orff at its head. The Bavarian Topographical Bureau when created was a civil organiza tion under the Ministry of the Royal House (State) until 1817, when it was transferred to the War Department and given a military organization by the chief of the General Staff, General von Raglowich, retaining, however, the civil employe's. The work has progressed by authority of royal decrees of 1817 and 1867. The present organization of the Topographical Bureau is as follows: 1 colonel, as director. 1 captain (first class), mathematical section. 1 captain (first class), known as major of the topographical section. 1 captain, chief of the reproduction works, especially the photographic branch."], [244, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 236 1 captain (first class), conservator. 2 captains from the retired list. 1 accountant. 1 copper-engraving inspector. 1 copper-engraving reviser. 8 copper engravers. 1 lithographer. 6 assistant topographers. 1 foreman of printing.

The above are permanently in service, while the following are tem- porary : 12 lieutenants \u2014 3 for mathematical section, 9 for topographic section. 12 subofficers (10 iu the topographic section). 2 soldiers, also printing clerks. For topographic duties in the field, the chiefs of the mathematical and topographic sections and the twelve lieutenants, with two draughts men, are employed. H istorically speaking, Bavaria appears to have been possessed of top ographic works from an early date. It is stated that Aventine prepared in 1523 a map of Upper and Lower Bavaria. The map of \"Apian,\" in 1563, has, however, been called the masterpiece of the Middle Ages. The material for this map was secured from 1554 to 1563 by \"Apian \" and a few assistants, traversing the country and making astronomical and other observations. It embraces 484 square feet, in 40 sheets (scale 1 : 50,000). The original is lost, and only a few copies of part of the map are preserved, but a reduction (scale 1 : 144,000), in 25 sheets, was published in 1568, which formed the basis of all maps of Bavaria during the two hundred years next following. German cartography is much indebted to one Johann Baptista Homann, from Nuremberg (1663-1724). He published in 1816 a large atlas of the world in approximately 100 sheets. This business, similar to that carried on by the present establishment of Justus Perthes at Gotha, consisted more particularly in collecting and compiling originals scientifically."], [245, "237 BAVARIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. The following is the title of the atlas : Homann's Atlas of 100 maps, representing geographically all parts of the earth, also setting forth clearly the difference existing between countries and states, with a review of the mathematical, natural, and historical geography. Published by the heirs of Homann, Nuremberg, 1717. It is accompanied by 40 pages of text and a description of the French degree measurement. The only-trace of a Roman itinerary is the so-called \"Tabula Peuting eriana,\" which is a list of places along the military road of the West Roman Empire, made either during the reign of Emperor Severus (193-211 A. D.), or compiled by order of Theodosius (also called \"Tabula Geogi'aphica Theodosiana\"). This table, designed in 12 s'heets of parchment, was found by Conrad Cettes, a monk in the Benedictine Convent at Tegernsee, who gave them to Conrad Peutinger, the antiquarian at Augsburg (1465-1537). Eleven of these sheets, forming when conjoined a strip of 6 meters long and 0.3 meters wide, were found again in 1714, having been lost after Peutinger's death, and are at present in the Imperial Library at Vienna. The Bavarian atlas is of military origin, its inception being due to Bonne, a celebrated French military geographical engineer, attached to the French army of occupation, whose plan was interrupted by the declaration of peace of 1801 and the recall of the army. Max. Joseph I (first King of Bavaria) recognized the importance of the plans of Bonne (1805), and decided to have an elaborate topographical atlas constructed. He opened negotiations with the French Republic (which Government was then in the lead as re gards scientific, topographic, and trigonometric surveys) with a view to enlist the services of French engineers, and Bonne and two others were allowed to repair to Munich and remain until 1807. Advances were gradually made in practical geodesy and astronomy, and especially through the works of Soldner, whose \"application of rectan gular spherical co-ordinates\" is still in use. From the Topographical Bureau thus established at Munich geodetic and astronomical observations were carried on by Bonne and his French associates, and plane-table work and detailed surveying by Bavarian engi-"], [246, "238 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. neers, from which resulted atlas maps, somewhat defective, however, as to their topographic representations. King Maximilian Joseph I ordered, in 1808, a general land survey on the scale of 1 : 5,000, and there was organized a central bureau, with a numerous staff, entitled (\"K\u0153nigliche unmittelbare Steuer-Kataster-Com mission\") the Royal Revenue Cadastral Commission. The Topographical Bureau was, however, to proceed to completion with the construction of the topographic map of the country (scale 1:50,000). Reductions of ap propriations and intervening war restricted this bureau for a time to office work alone and publication of maps. The first two sheets (Munich and Wolfrathshausen) were published in 1812, and nine more were ready for publication in 1817. These sheets, while showing marked improvements, were still unsatis factory. The Topographical Bureau, which had been up to 1817 under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was transferred to the War Office and placed under the charge of the chief of the General Staff, the number of civilians reduced, and their places taken by officers of the General Staff. In the mean time the cadastral surveys were pushed with great vigor and their results incorporated in the topographical atlas, from time to time improved as to its topographic delineations, Lehman's method of representation, with slight modifications having been adopted. There were thirty-seven sheets executed from 1820-30. Maps of Upper and Central Franconia, comprising the principalities Anspach and Bayreuth, were also published during this decade, although resulting from indifferent surveys. The maps of the mountainous districts of South Bavaria, published from 1825-35, excel in precision and artistic effect. During 1830-50 maps of Suabia, Central and Lower Franconia, and. from 1850-67, maps of Bavaria, on left bank of Rhine, were published. Meanwhile a general topographic map of South Germany (scale 1:250,000, 25 sheets, copper engraved,) was in course of preparation, delaying the progress of the atlas (1:50,000), which was finally completed in 1867 in in 110 sheets. There having been a lack of uniformity in the successive delineations of this atlas, a thorough revision of 47 of the oldest and faulty sheets was"], [247, "239 BAVARIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. ordered. In 1838 trigonometric determinations of altitudes were com menced, and gradually extended over the whole country, except south western parts of Upper Bavaria and Upper Suabia. These measurements, together with the precision-leveling of 1868-78, form the basis of other hypsometric works, but inasmuch as these heights (in total) were obtained partly trigonometrically, partly by leveling, and the balance by mercurial and aneroid barometers, and official considera tions requiring a frequent changing of the fields of operation, these were not continuous and connected, while also the net-work of triangles was more dense in some parts of the country than in others, and the established bench-marks, therefore, vary from 6, in the southeastern part, to 60, in the Palatinate, to the square German mile. Measurement of heights. \u2014 The surveys begun in 1868 with level curves at normal equidistances of 10 meters, served as a frame-work or rough scale for the topographic sketching, confining the scope or conception of the topographer to narrow limits. In the absolute amount of the detail to be secured by the topographer much has to be left to the individual judgment of the observer, since if all the changes of relief are to be absolutely de termined with great mathematical precision, and delineated, as is the case in the contour surveys of sites for fortifications for instance, the time and cost would be immoderate, unjustifiable, and incommensurate with the intended objects or expected advantages. This may be to some extent also understood when the cost of the limited space accurately profiled by a final railroad or canal survey is taken into consideration, which survey if made general for an area instead of being confined to the actual line of construction would reach figures in most instances greater than any present or prospective value of the land. For each cadastral sheet (5.44 square kilometers) 80-160 points (bench marks) were determined, or at the rate of 15.30 points for each square kilometer. The first accurate measurement of heights commenced in 1838 in the Palatinate, and after many interruptions was provisionally completed in 1851. The original datum point is a bench-mark at the principal Protest ant church of Carlsruhe, being on the floor at door zz 39.36 Baden rods."], [248, "240 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. \u2014 40.458 Bavarian rods = 118.08 meters. This point had been trigono metrically determined by the aid of an 8-inch theodolite, with vertical circle, during the hypsometric triangulation of Baden, and is referred to the pavement of the cathedral at Strasburg = 48.584 Baden rods zz 145.752 meters. From the Carlsruhe bench-mark the positions of all the primary tri angulation points in the Palatinate were determined by trigonometric methods. The reduction of angles and calculation of the primary triangu lation, verified by numerous observations, was made by the method of least squares, the mean error of a directly measured difference in elevation proving to be zz -f- 0.639. The bench-marks engraved on the atlas for the areas along the right bank of the Rhine designate the elevation above the tide-gauge at Amster dam, or the normal zero at Berlin reduced by 1.74 meters. Elevations brought from the Adriatic in 1863, as reported by the Military Geographical Institute, require a correction of\u2014 0.42 meter to be made to the bench-marks referred to mean sea level at Amsterdam, while late communications fix this correction at \u2014 0.94 meter. The difference thus indicated between the mean levels of the North Sea and Adriatic is but little greater than that between the North Sea and Baltic determined by the Prussian land survey. The method of surveying the level curves was introduced in Bavaria in 1868; these are not, however, introduced into the atlas (1 : 50,000), but are made accessible to the public at small cost by reproduction of the original field minutes (scale 1 : 25,000) by photolithography; up to 1885 200 of the 990 sheets (scale 1 : 25,000) had been issued. The 47 sheets of the map 1:50,000 undergoing revision are to be is sued as 85 half-sheets, of which 55 were complete at the close of 1880, the whole to be finished in 1886. Bavaria contributes 80 sheets to the 674 required for the \"degree map of the German Empire\" (scale 1:100,000), of which the 2 sheets on the left bank of the Rhine, and 4 sheets of the northern tier were completed July 1, 1885. The character of the hachures on the above maps has been so modi fied as to represent declivities from 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 by dotted hachures and from 5C to 10\u00b0 (45\u00b0 black) with alternately one dotted and one full hachure."], [249, "BAVARIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 241 To defray the expenses of Bavaria's quota for the general German map (1:100,000) 9,000 marks per annum is allotted. The Bavarian surveys, in their full sense, have the two following prin cipal purposes : 1 . The preparation of an exact cadastral plan for revenue considera tions and all practical public purposes, where horizontal dimensions and distances alone are required; and 2. The preparation of a suitable topographic map primarily for mili tary purposes, but for scientific and economic ends as well. The execution of the former upon the scale of 1:5,000 by the cadas tral bureau (organized in 1808) was completed in 1860. Its foundation was a system of primary triangles, with the necessary astronomical observations. Upon these operations a special work was pub lished entitled \"The Scientific Basis of the Bavarian Land Survey.\" The primary triangulation was combined with others of the second, third, and fourth orders, thus determining 30-35 trigonometrically determined points to the square German mile. With these points as a basis, the detail survey has been made contin uous and connected (for the present 1:25,000 map) by means ofthe plane table and a special distance-measuring apparatus. There results perfect atlas sheets for imposts and duties. The cadastral bureau is now limited to the revision of the cadastral charts (1:5,000) and supplementary surveys on a larger scale when re quired. The work (2) is executed by the Topographical Bureau. While the Cadastral Bureau has cognizance only of the horizontal survey (ground plans of inhabited places, boundaries of property, &c), the chief duty of the Topographical Bureau has been the surveying and delineation of the ground reliefs, .. e., of the vertical features, and the production of a com prehensive graphic projection and delineation thereof. In the commencement the surveys were made largely by sketching, but for the last twenty-five years the measurement of altitudes have been made partly by trigonometrical, partly by barometrical, and partly by ordinary leveling methods. Since 1868 level curves, at equidistances of 10 1366 wh 16"], [250, "242 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. meters, have been introduced. For obtaining the level curves, portable alt-azimuth instruments and aneroid barometers are used, 800-1,000 alti tude points to the square German mile resulting therefrom.* The topographic results are transferred upon the cadastral sheets, then reduced to scale of 1 : 15,000, the orographic details drawn by the Lehman system, and then reproduced by photolithography at scale of 1 : 25,000, forming also the basis of the copper-engraved charts of 1 : 50,000. The Cadastral Bureau has the following organization : 1 upper impost supervisor, 1 cadastre inspector, 2 cadastre assessors, 2 trigonometers, 8 upper geometers, about 30 cadastre geometers, 1 lithographic reviser, 1 printing master, and, approximately, 30 lithographers. The labors of this bureau are not restricted to the survey alone, but thev embrace the calcu lations of surface property, the value of soils, the harvest productions, &c. The cost of the cadastral survey (each sheet embracing 5.45 square kil ometers) cannot be given, but for a single sheet it has been estimated at, approximately, 1,000 marks (about $79 per square statute mile). The average cost of the cadastral survey (1810-1860) may be approx imated at 600,000 marks (150,000), and since 1860 at 300 to 350,000 marks per annum. The whole country (1,380 German square miles) is divided for this purpose into 1 20 precincts, within each of which one geometer resides for * The following taken from an address ( \"Mittheilungen iiber die Aufgaben nnd die Thatigkiet des topographischen Bureaus in Miinchen,\" see proceedings of Geographical Society of Munich, part 8, 1864,) by Colonel von Orff, bears upon the origin of horizontal curves to express topographic relief: \"The French engineer Noizet de St. Paul,t was the first to propose the use of horizontal curves but only in connection with architectural planning (on large scales) and constructions; afterward, Monge, the ingenious inventor of descriptive geometry, applied them in representing uneven surfaces ; still later, Bonne, as member of the commission for determining upon construction of the Atlas of France, 1 : 80,000, proposed to express the \" terrain\" by equidistant curves, but was not successful in having the proposition carried out. In Germany this method was first employed on the survey and original drawings of the beautiful atlas of Hesse-Cassel (1835), which, however, it was deemed more appropriate to publish in hachures.\" Lieut. General von Morozowicz, late chief of the Prussian state survey, in the pamphlet here tofore cited, says : ' ' The present state of development of topographic methods was, in 1830, still in its infancy. The brilliant idea ofthe Swiss engineer du Caria, to express \" differences of altitude and variation in form ofthe earth's surface\" by equidistant curves, has long battled for recognition, the necessity of suffi cient level and altitude determinations, conditioned thereby, delaying its practical introduction.\" \" Between 1830 and 1840, the first attempts in this new direction of terrain representation were published, but it took until the years 1840 to 1850 before this idea was fully appreciated, aud still some Governments pay no attention to the use of equidistant curves.\" t General Noizet de St. Paul, whose writings on fortifications appear as early as 1792, was for merly \"Director of Fortifications\" in France, aud the originator of what has been termed the \"new method \" in Fortification."], [251, "BAVARIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 243 the purpose of revising cadastral plans, following divisions and changes of property, his services being paid for by the property-holders.

Each sheet comprises 30'. 8 in longitude by 13'. 5 in latitude (an area at latitude 47\u00b0 N. of exactly 1,000 square kilometers, or approximately, 390 square miles). The delineated portion of the printed sheet (paper 39 by 24 inches) covers 31J by 19f inches. No elevations are shown on the sample, the usual conventional signs having been followed. The initial meridian of reference is Munich. Figures are given for each degree and five minutes in latitude and longitude, and divisions along the borders for each ten seconds. The sheets are known by number and name of the principal place, and the name of the four adjoining sheets appear on the corresponding borders. The printed scale is in geographical miles. Scale 1 : 25,000. \u2014 The area of each is, approximately, 34 square miles. No latitude or longitude divisions are stated. The divisional areas are not aliquot parts of the sheet's scale, 1 : 50,000. The size of the topographic portion on No. 390 is 14\u00a7 inches square, printed on paper 21\u00a3 by 17 inches. The delineation of relief is by a combination of hachures and contours,* and issued by photolithography in black without tint. The elevation of prominent points is given in meters (no number given on contours). The sheets are numbered besides stating name of principal locality. The scale is in kilometers. The curves are at an equidistance of 10 meters. The publication has been in course since 1875. These sheets are square, each side being 9,336 meters in length, equal to 4 cadastral sheets (each of the latter sides being 2,334 meters), or an area of about 87.5 square kilometers. Notb. \u2014 These sheets represent the so-called ' ' Situation,\" that is, the details concerning habitation (places, villages, &c), the water and road net, the boundaries of cultivation (fields, meadows, orchards vineyards, forests, &c), as well as property boundaries. The reliefs, however, are not considered on the cadastral map. The objects and aims of the Topographical Bureau consist, therefore, to express, on a scale of 1 : 25,000, the form of the \"terrain\" as accurately as the scale will permit, at the same * Since 1884 hachures have been omitted, and horizontal curves, printed in brown, from 5 to 10 meters apart, introduced."], [252, "244 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. time to ascertain and record such changes as to planimetric detail as may have taken place since the cadastral survey was made. The survey of the \"terrain\" is, therefore, of a two-fold nature: 1. Fundamental determination of as many altitudes as there are mathematically established points on which to base further detail operations. There are determined in this manner 50 to 60 fixed points per German square mile (54f square kilometers or about 22 square statute miles) either by level or trigonometrically, or by carefully controlled aneroid observations ; in consequence there is not less than one point (fixed in latitude, longitude, and altitude) to every square kilometer. 2. The detailed survey is intimately connected with these fixed points. According to tbe com plexity of the surface forms there are determined from 12 to 25 altitudes per square kilometer with the use of small vertical circles or aneroids in pairs, at the same time the natural features are sketched on the spot and the horizontal curves (5 to 10 meters interval) are drawn on the original cadastral sheets. A well trained and expert topographer can furnish a survey of 12 square kilometers and the detail for revision in ten days. The entire annual appropriation of the Topographical Bureau is 115, 000 marks ($28,750). Found at 110,000 marks in 1835. In earlier years the annual cost was 55,000 florins, and it has been estimated that the entire sum expended by the Topographical Bureau alone has aggregated 7,000, 000 marks (approximately $1,750,000). The appropriations form a part of the regular military budget. The above expenditure, which is independent of the cost of the cadastral survey, is at the rate of $59 per square statute mile.* Independent of the usual scale of 1 : 5,000, there are maps of the following special scales issued by the Cadastral Bureau, viz: 1 : 1,000, for large cities. 1 : 2,500, for sections containing much subdivided property and medium sized cities. 1 : 100,000, for the general divisions of the country and of the bounda ries of impost communities The Topographical Bureau issues maps on the scales of 1 : 25,000, 1 : 50,000, 1 : 100,000, 1 : 250,000, and 1 : 800,000, as before stated, with the exception ofthe 47 sheets on the 1 : 50,000 scale undergoing revision; that atlas is complete, and work is progressing on the quota of 30 sheets for the General German Atlas and upon the 990 sheets of the 1 : 25,000 scale.

Copper engraving in the topographical bureau is confined to the sheets of scales 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 100,000. Photolithography is employed for the series of the scale 1:25,000. Chromolithography is exceptionally employed, and \"helio gravure \" is passing through the experimental stage. So far as known, no other branches of the Government of Bavaria, besides the Cadastral and Topographical Bureaus, issue maps of its terri tory. The publications other than the maps consist of the quarto volume already mentioned upon the main scientific features of the work, and a sec ond in course regarding the minor triangulations and topographic and detailed survey operations. Following the unification of map work for the entire German Empire, the triangulation of Bavaria has been joined with. that of Prussia at the three following points: Gross-Gleichberg, Inselberg, and Katzenbuchel; the necessary reobservations were made and the whole rendered homogeneous, in pursuance, it is believed, of requirements for observations enjoined by the Central Bureau at Berlin for European degrees measurements. In most of the German survey operations the plane-table has gradually succeeded the method of direct .measurements upon the ground, and while it answers very well for all general contours it must necessarily fail in securing that sum of critically measured asliss: tKat are unfailingly required for the present map, and which, in turn, become a store house for future reference.

The Kingdom of Wurtemberg has special surveys of its territory, based principally upon the cadastral survey scale 1:2,500 (executed from 1818\u2014 1840), which, in turn, is reduced to 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 for publica tion, and it contributes a quota of 20 entire sheets to the general topo graphic map of Germany (scale 1:1,000,000 \u2014 674 sheets).* The area of Wurtemberg is 7,528 square miles, with a population of 1,970,132 in 1880, or at the average of 26 L per square mile. The work is entrusted to the Royal Statistical Topographic Bureau at Stuttgart. The personnel of the topographic branch consists of 1 director (Col. H. Bach, Corps of Engineers), and 1 honorary director, 1 secretary, 1 trigo nometer, 2 computers, 1 reviser, 2 lithographers, 3 topographers, 1 geognost, 4 draughtsmen, 3 copper engravers, 3 clerks, 1 copyist, and 1 messenger. There is also a consultative commission composed of delegates from the Ministries of Justice, Interior, Education and War. The Bureau was created in pursuance of royal decree of November 28, 1820, placing it tinder the Ministry of Finance, confiding to it the duty of collectis.0 and tabulating accurate and exhaustive information on all sub jects relating to population, geography, national and local resources, &c. 1. The general statistics of the country relating to real estate, popula tion, agriculture and live stock, trades and industry, commerce and com munication, as well as 2.

The continued correction and publication of the topographic maps, based upon the cadastral survey. 2. The completion of the description of the \" Oberamts\" districts. 3. The compilation of meteorologic observations. The bureau is also charged with editing the periodically appearing Court and State hand-book. * See lists of maps for Wurtemberg in introduction."], [255, "247 WURTEMBERG\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. The work of this bureau is sub-divided according to objects into 3 branches, having the care and development of (1,) statistics, (2,) topog raphy and meteorology, and (3,) history. It was also charged with recording all changes occurring in these branches from year to year, thus enabling Government departments as well as citizens to obtain correct and detailed information of the actual conditions and circumstances ofthe country. The bureau for a time was in co-operation with the \" National Historical Society,\" the latter being specially charged. with affairs pertaining to history, statistics, and topography; also with the publication of results in form easily accessible to the public. In order that this bureau should be encouraged and aided by the active co-operation of the different ministries, and at the same time meet all public demands, it was concluded, in 1856, to consolidate the National Society of History with the Statistico-Topographical Bureau, under regulations then made and pro vided. The following brief historical notes are gathered from the history of German surveys by Jordan & Steppes: Johann Stoffler (1452-1531), a celebrated mathematician and astron omer at Tubingen, appears to have been the first Suabian cartographer, but his works were burned in the fire which destroyed the university in 1 534. There is, however, in existence a map by his pupil Sebastian Munster, a monk of the convent at Tubingen, dating back over 300 years, and con sidered the oldest on record. A sac-simile of this is given in Quenstedt's (\"Geologische ausfltige in Schwaben) \"geological excursions in Suabia,\" Tubingen, 1864. The rivers and localities are fairly represented, but not the mountains. The oldest published map of Wurtemberg appeared in 1559 at Tubin gen, being a wood cut, and printed on common letter paper. In 1572, David Seltzin, at Ulm, issued a map of Suabia, showing latitude and longi tude degrees. About 1570, 22 plates, finely drawn on parchment, were published by George Gadner, and copied in 1575 by \"Ortelius\" in his \"Theatrum orbis terrarum;\" Mercator's atlas, ed. Hondius, 1635, also re fers to Seltzin and Gadner."], [256, "248 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Mostlin (1550-1631), the instructor of Kepler and Schickard (1592 1635), first determined the latitude of Tubingen. One Bohnenberg appears as a reformer in South German topography, having submitted in 1793 to the Duke Carl a plan for a trigonometric survey and for the construction of a map after the method of Cassi'ni's map of France. The total amount appropriated from public funds was 600 florins (less than $300), as the balance was to be supplied by the firm under contract to publish the map. The first sheet of Bohnenberg's map ap peared in 1798, and the sheet \"Tubingen\" about 1800. A more extensive map of Suabia was afterwards undertaken by Boh nenberg and Amman, the first sheet appearing in 1798, 19 in 1806, and 30 in 1810. This work was finally carried into Baden by \"Michaelis,\" and later into Hesse, until 60 sheets were finally produced, each 18.72 square German miles, on the scale of 1 : 86,400, constructed on the Cassini projec tion (Soldner's). A French military map of Suabia was also commenced about the year 1800, in wliich the Bohnenberg material was utilized, the map being more attractive in appearance. The history of Wurtemberg's land survey is intimately connected with the name of Bohnenberg, who was appointed its director in 1803, in which capacity he was engaged until his death, April 19, 1831. All topographic works prior to 1818 are much inferior to those executed later, when tri angulation as a basis for cadastral surveys was begun. Height measure ments were also commenced at this time. Trigonometric determinations of heights referred to the floor of the cathedral at Strasburg (145,752 meters above sea level) were made in 1836-38. The height measurements com menced more in detail in 1859, were completed in 1880, and the principal points entered on both the topographical and geological atlas maps. Agreeably to the requirement of co-ordination with the military map of Germany of 1 : 100,000, it was ordered to reduce all heights to the nor mal zero at Berlin. The topographic land survey atlas (1818-40) is based on plane-table sheets 1,145.96 meters on each side (scale 1:2,500). These sheets are reduced to 1 : 25,000; 100 of these reduced sheets form again one sheet (1 : 25,000) of the same dimensions as the original plane-"], [257, "WURTEMBERG\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIO. 249 table sheet (16 inches), and four of these latter sheets (1 : 25,000) are again reduced to one sheet (1 : 50,000) for general publication. Lehman's method is employed for expressing the topography. For several of the older atlas sheets it has been necessary to transfer the altitudes connected with the nor mal zero at Berlin. No perfected sections of the 20 integers to be contrib uted to the general topographic map of Germany (1 : 100,000) have yet been finished (August 1, 1885). The first will be published toward the first of the coming year. The number of field survey sheets (scale 1 : 50,000) was 189 ; these were copied by the pentograph to the scale of 1 : 50,000 upon stone, and thus the 55 sheets of the topographic atlas (1821-44) were prepared. No pub lication of the 189 original sheets has ever been made. A special topographic map (1:25,000 \u2014 192 sheets) is to be executed by the Statistico-Topographic Bureau. The sheets are square (0m.229 in size), representing a length of 5,729.8 meters The water is printed in blue, the planimetry and lettering in black ; reliefs are shown in red (curves 10 meters, with numbers). Numerous elevations in black are placed in the intervals between the curves. Each sheet is divided in five divisions num bered outwardly from the meridian and parallel of Tubingen, dividing the sheets into 25 little rectangles.* This atlas (1821-44), scale 1:50,000, was deficient in the number of absolute altitudes, which deficiency was remedied by the trigonometric measurements executed from 1859 to 1881. A map on the. scale of 1 : 200,000, with horizontal curves at intervals of 50 meters, was proposed and abandoned, and finally the scales above stated were adopted, conditioned largely upon the existence of the lithographed cadastral survey sheets, 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 (the latter for towns and villages), while those made at a former period at the scale 1 : 5,000 were reduced by pentograph to the scale 1 : 2,500, all contributing to -the general topographic atlas scale, 1 : 50,000. * The above is taken from the list of maps and plans at the archives of the geographical service of the war department at Paris."], [258, "250 GOVERNMENT LAND AIT) MARINE SURVEYS.

It is claimed that this survey is possessed of more established points per square kilometer than that of any other German state, having from 300 to 500, while Prussia and Baden have approximately 20 to the square kilometer. In 1878, 2,730 (of which 304 were villages and towns) of the 15,572 plane-table sheets of the cadastral survey (1 : 2,500), or 18 per cent., had been surveyed after the manner stated, the balance being simply a matter of time and cost. All published sheets are purchasable at inexpensive rates fixed by the Government. BADEIs\". Topographic. Since 1875 there has been conducted within the grand duchy of Baden a special detailed topographic survey, at the scale of 1 : 25,000, to be pub lished in 170 sheets. The area of Baden is approximately 5,822 square miles, its population in 1880, 1,570,189, or an average of 269 per square mile. The survey is made by a special Topographical Bureau located at"], [259, "251 BADEN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC Carlsruhe, under the Department of Commerce, with Lieut. Colonel Schnei der of the royal Prussian General Staff at its head. The personnel, other than the director, consists of six topographers, four draughtsmen, and the necessary clerks. Tbe topographers are engaged in the field six to eight months, remaining in the office during the winter. Trigonometric and topo graphic works commenced in Baden (1812-14) soon after its consolidation into a state, under Colonel Tulla, chief of engineers (1770-1820). Subsequently, in 1824, the Military Topographical Bureau was estab lished for the topographic survey of the country, and placed under the grand ducal General Staff. Its first duty was the compilation of a general map of Baden, scale 1 : 50,000, in 55 sheets, which was executed from 1824 to 1849. The pri mary triangulation of this survey served as the basis of the detailed trian gulation of the cadastral survey. The greater part of the topographic personnel was assigned in 1852 to the then recently begun cadastral survey, which moreover, together with the completed portions of the map and sundry cartographic works in course of preparation by the grand ducal General Staff, was transferred to Prussia on the conclusion ofthe military convention with the latter in 1871. The printing and issuing of the General Staff map of Baden (scale 1 : 50,000) has since 1871 taken place from the General Staff Bureau at Berlin. CADASTRAL SURVEY. The act of March 26, 1852, ordains \"that all real estate of the grand duchy, piece b}r piece, be surveyed.\" The usual scale employed has been 1 : 1,500, while for small parcels the scales of 1 : 1,000, 1 : 750, and 1 : 500 have been used, as well as the scales of 1 : 2,000 and 1 : 4,000 for larger fields. In 1855 a Cadastral Bureau (Kataster-Direotion), fulty organized, was established. In 1872 this Bureau was abolished and its duties transferred to the Rev enue Bureau (Steuer-Direction). In 1877 the cadastral survey was trans ferred from the Revenue Bureau and placed under the \" chief direction of hydraulic works and road improvements \" (Ober-Direction des Wasser- und"], [260, "252 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Strassenbaues), where it is managed by a \"technical bureau of cadastral surveys,\" under the immediate charge of an \"inspector of surveys.\" Subsequent to the military convention of 1871\u2014 the preparation of the chart on the scale of 1:50,000 having covered a considerable period, during which numerous changes had taken place in regard to means of communi cation, stream and river courses, in the conditions of cultivation and resi dence, and that the claims of science might be responded to as well as the many problems relative to river improvements, road making, and railroad building, &c\u2014 it was decided to prepare a map on a larger scale, and that of 1:25,000 was adopted, the contour of the ground being represented by horizontal curves, 10 meters apart. This map was undertaken solely upon the responsibility of the grand ducal government and from its own resources (with the consent of the house of deputies) and intrusted to the present director, formerly chief of the topographic section of the General Staff, dis solved in 1871. The results of the survey of the forests, carried on since 1834 in con nection with the general triangulation, and also the cadastral survey begun in 1852 (about three-fourths finished), with the improvement of property distribution inaugurated in 1856, are availed of in the map construction. The new map (1:25,000) will likewise serve as a basis for the sheets covering Baden of the German Empire map (1:100,000), being engraved at Berlin, the slight changes necessary being made. After the completion of the map (1:25,000) it is stated that a geological chart will be compiled under a commission, the present map being the basis, while each year a number of the sheets will be prepared for a new edition, constantly revised, and for which purpose copper-plate engraving has been chosen as the means of reproduction, and steel coatings are added when necessary. It has recently been determined to complete portions of sheets lapping into the adjoining territory of Alsatia, Bavaria, Hesse, Wurtemberg, Prussia, and Switzerland, the topographic material being gathered by special recon naisance. A \"people's edition\" of the atlas is in course of preparation. The topographic reliefs are here shown by a brown tint under a com bination of vertical and oblique lights, by which a thorough understanding of the form of the ground is facilitated."], [261, "BADEN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 253 The survey of Baden has been considered as a mean between North and South German methods. Soldner's system of rectangular co-ordinates being of South German origin, while the preference for independent treat ment of the topography in advance of cadastral surveys accords with the Prussian practice. The projection of the map (1 : 50,000) is constructed on the Flamsteed's modified method, taking 1 : 308.64 as the value of the polar depression. The atlas remained for thirty years without changes, except ordinary revision, and was transferred in 1871. Much material had been collected since 1846. Independent of the revision and readjustment of the horizontal triangula tion, the cadastral surveys (made since 1852 at scale of 1:1,500) necessi tated a triangulation of the fourth order. This office has issued from 1824 to 1885 (other than those given in the list), \"Oberamts maps\" or district maps, for administrative purposes, in 64 sheets, each embracing one district. These cadastral surveys furnished an excellent basis, but unfortunately have not yet covered fully one-fourth of the state. Since 1875 numerous trigonometric detailed height measurements for topographical purposes have been made. The Prussian plan of trape zoidal sections is followed, the latitude and longitude of Mannheim being the initial point. The elevation of the spire of the cathedral at Strasburg is \u2014 95.994 (Baden rods) \u2014 287.982 meters, and the zero-point at the tide gauge of the Rhine 45.590 (Baden rods) \u2014 136.77 meters above sea-level.

Geologic. The origin from which the present organization for the geological sur vey of Prussia emanates dates to the early part of 1862. The administra tion of mines, at that time the fifth division of the Ministry of Commerce, Trades, and Public Works (afterwards the first division of the department of public works), had proceeded with the execution of geological survey maps (Uebersichtskarten) of the Rhenish and Westphalian provinces (scale 1:80,000) and of Lower and Upper Silesia (scale 1:100,000). It became evident during the prosecution of the work that the use of the larger scale (1:25,000) of the plane-table sheets ofthe General Staff Survey would in"], [264, "256 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. ever}7 way enhance the scientific and practical value of the results, which proposition received the proper administrative approval December 12, 1866. A conference of geologists was called March 9 and 10, 1867, at which it was shown that the experiences gained in prosecuting the geognostic in vestigation of the province of Saxony necessitated a modification of the plan, and it was decided to prepare a general geological map of the prov ince of Saxony and the Thuringian Principalities in 8 sections (scale 1 : 100,000). The field records for this map having been recorded on plane table sheets of a scale 1:25,000, the advantages of this latter scale became so apparent that the original plan of publishing a general map at a scale of 1 : 100,000 was abandoned, substituting the reproduction of the original field sheets (1:25,000) for the time being, until such time as the accumulated material and data would warrant the publication of a general map at 1:100,000. This scale (1:25,000) admits of representing every detail of importance concerning agriculture, mining, and the delineation of existing mineral indications, resources, quarries, &c. It is assumed that a skillful observer can collect the data for 2 plane-table sheets (100 square miles) in a season of five to six months on average ground. With each plane table sheet there is to be published a short explanatory text of not more than 2 sheets with more extensive reports as larger areas are mapped. The objects of the work seem to be based on a scientific examination of the highest order, utilizing \"pari passu\" the results therefrom as aids to the practical every day problems of industrial life. The following statute of April 8, 1875, determines the functions of the gelogical establishment: \u00a7 I. The royal geological survey is charged with the prosecution and execution of a geological examination of Prussia, and to elaborate the results in such a manner that they shall be universally accessible and useful to science as well as to the economic interests of the country. \u00a711.

This special map shall contain a complete representation of the geological relations, of the condition of the soil, and the occurrence of economically useful rocks and min erals, accompanied by explanatory notes. (2) The production of a general geological map, based upon the general staff maps (1 : 100,000), in accordance with the progress of the special map."], [265, "257 PRUSSIA-GEOLOGIC. (3) The elaboration of monographic geological representations of specially inter- esting portions of the country or mineral occurrences. (4) The publication of reports of geological, paleontological, mountainistic, and kindred subjects, supplementary to the maps. (5) The collection and custody of documentary support to the maps and other works. (6) The collection aud care of objects of geological interest and information relating thereto. \u00a7 III. The administration of the geological survey consists of two directors, ap- pointed by the King, of whom one is ex-officio director of the Academy of Mines. Un der their supervision and collaboration the work of the geological survey is executed by regularly-appointed geologists and a number of assistants. The duties of the geol- ogists and assistants are governed by special instructions. \u00a7 IV. The duties in common of the directors are: (1) Determination of yearly plan of operations. (2) Supervision as regards execution according to the plan. (3) The preparation and organization of meetings of collaborating geologists and the execution of measures adopted by them. (4) Revision of yearly work of collaborators. (5) Direction of all publications of the survey. (6) Direction of the work of museum collections. (7) Submission of yearly progress reports. The following was the organization in 1880 : I. Administration : 2 directors, one of whom, the director of the Academy of Mines (Bergakademie), is ex officio first director of the institute. II. Geologists : 8 regularly appointed. III. Assistants : 4 regularly appointed. IV. Collaborators : 17, not appointed, but temporarily employed at a per diem compensation and traveling- expenses.

Hauchecorne with vigor. SAXONY. Geologic. The geological examination of Saxony is carried on through a director (Dr. Hermann Credner, Leipzig,) with a number of assistants, the former being immediately responsible to the Ministry of Finance. The work was organized in 1872, by virtue of royal approval, under the title \" Geologische Landesuntersuchung des Konig. Sachsen,\" the funds for the purpose having been granted by the house of deputies of the kingdom. The director, being a professor at the university at Leipzig, has the opportunity of selection of assistants from a large number of students of that institution. The number of assistants is 7 geologists and 3 collaborators for special purposes. The object is to secure the most perfectly accurate examination of the geological structure, mineral wealth and character of the soil, useful in results to science, agriculture, forestry, mining and commerce, as well as other technical branches of industry. The following means of accomplish ing this object have been proposed: 1. The preparation and publication of a special geological chart and profiles, both with explanatory text. 2. The publication of independent essays and larger treatises, con cerning mineralogy, geology, and paleontology, as well as upon agriculture and mineral wealth. 3. A comprehensive (final) publication of the scientific and technical branches. 4. To make accessible to the scientific public all documents on car tographic surveys, original copies of petrography and paleontologic de-"], [267, "259 SAXONY\u2014 GEOLOGIC. scriptions, a collection of the original survey maps, &c, and a most com plete collection of geological literature relating to Saxony. The special military topographic map (scale, 1:25,000 \u2014 156 sheets) serves as a basis for the geological representations. The variations of the ground conditions are noted at vertical distances of every ten meters. The resulting final chart, including the extension of marginal sheets into adjoin ing countries, embraces a surface of 32.55 square meters. This map is also used as the groundwork of the new geological field examination. Formations that appear on the surface are shown only, as a rule, by different colors, similar to those employed by the Prussian geological survey. Great weight is placed upon the examination of the alluvium and its com prehensive cartographic representation. The railroad excavations and constructions assist materially and are availed of immediately as new lines are being built, It is proposed, among other matters, to subject the question of the fossil botany of Saxony to a new investigation. It is stated that the publication of the map is duplicated in the most level parts, one represent ing the more superficial and modern formations, consisting of Quaternary and Tertiary, another the underlying permanent or more ancient strata. Each of the special maps (scale 1 : 25^000) has one or several marginal profiles, with an explanation of colors. The explanatory notes form from two to six separate sheets. After five years' preparatory work the first six sheets appeared in 1878. These sheets belonged for the greater part to the l'egion of the Erzgebirge and Mittelgebirge. According to an index-map, furnished by Dr. Credner, 34 sheets had already appeared, and 20 others, making 54 in all, were to have been issued at the close of 1882. No data is at hand regarding the cost of this special work or its dura tion.

It is ac companied by a large 8\u00b0 volume of explanatory text under the title of \"Geognostische Beschreibung des bayerischen Alpengebirgs und seines Vorlandes.\" The second part, composed also of five sheets, appeared in 1868, and a volume of accompanying text \"Geognostische Beschreibung des ost bayerischen Grenzgebiregs oder des bayerischen und Oberpfalzer Wald gebirges.\" The third part was issued in 1879 in two sheets, accompanied by \" Geognostische Beschreibung des Fichtelgebirges mit dem Franken walde und dem westlichen Vorlande.\" The whole (12 sheets in all) were published at Gotha by Justus Perthes. The field observations are recorded on maps of the General Staff or cadastral survey varying in scale from 1 : 5,000 to 1 : 25,000. The maps of the Franconian Alps and Jura are now under press at Cassel, and examinations are carried on in the Palatimate and on the plains of the Danube.

The new general topographic map of Austria-Hungary (scale 1:75,000, 720 sheets) has been in course of execution since 1872, and should be com pleted in 1886. The total area embraced (the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy) is 241,553 square miles, with a population of 37,869,954 in 1880, or an average of 157 per square mile. CIVIL DIVISIONS. Fourteen of the nineteen provinces into which the monarchy is divided are Cisleithan or German and five Transleithan or Hungarian. The provinces are subdivided into counties or \" komitats\" in Hungary and Transylvania, into quarters or \"viertels\" in Lower Austria, and into circles or \"kreis\" elsewhere. Communes or \"gemeinde\" are a further subdivision. MILITARY DIVISIONS. There are thirteen general and military commands, subdivided into 102 regimental districts. The French metric system was legally introduced July 23, 1871, remaining permissive from January 1, 1873, to January 1, 1876, when it was made compulsory. The above work is probably the most important of the current under takings of the Imperial Royal Military Geographical Institute at Vienna, Note. \u2014 The following, found on p. 18, Vol. I, annual report ofthe Military Geog. Ins. atVieuna, 1881, bears on the formation of special corps organized for topographic work: Upon the decision of His Majesty, the Emperor, of January 6, 1851 , a special corps of Military Engineer Geographers was created, in order to cultivate and develop to the greatest extent the work of the Institute and to educate a num ber of permanent officers, possessed of the qualifications and ability required for field and office work, scientific and practical, intended in time of peace for the execution of all geodetic and astronomio works, connected with the survey of the country, as well as for the collection of all the available map material for, and the construction of, maps. These were specially selected alone from officers of the Army. This corps was under the command of the director of the Institute, and consisted of 2 colonels, 2 lieutenant-colonels, 4 majors, 16 captains, 12 first and 8 second lieutenants. A number of these officers were detailed on active service at the various army headquarters as field archivists for topographic or reconnaissance service, or as General Staff officers. Upon the reorganization of the General Staff (Jan uary, 1861) this corps was dissolved."], [272, "264 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. the director of which since 1879 has been Maj. Gen. Joseph Wanka von Len zenheim. The post-office address of the Institute is Vienna (VIII), Austria (Vienne, VIII, Autriche). This service forms a part of the General Staff of the War Department, acting, however, as an independent whole, possessed of general as well as special functions, and established by royal decree of 1839 The personnel consists of officers, military officials, with an added technical force ; also non-commissioned officers and selected enlisted men. The Annual Reports of the Military Geographical Institute at Vienna (Mittheilungen des K. K. Militar-Geographischen Institutes) are issued in pursuance of a Royal Decree, and include the \"work done\" each year from May 1 to the succeeding April 30. From these much of the data here with has been obtained. The first volume (1881) contains a brief history of the cartography of the Austrian possessions from the earliest date to the present; also a descrip tive history of the Institute, divided in sections. The first atlas of the German Austrian domain, under the name \" Typi Chorografici Austria?,\" by Wolfgang Latz, imperial counselor and professor at the University of Vienna, appears to have been published in 1561 in 11 wood-cuts, engraved bv Michael Zimmerman. These maps were wanting in methodical projection, graduation, and scale, not even having the distances between places given, that had been indicated on the so-called \" Peutinger's Map,\" an old Roman road map sup posed to be of the second or third century. The oldest maps of the Austrian Empire date from the seventeenth century. The first map of Upper Austria (scale 1:144,000, 6 sheets) appeared in 1667; in 1670 that of Lower Austria (scale 1:115,200, in 8 sheets), and in 1678 that of Styria (scale 1:167,760, 6 sheets). They were based on a geometrical survey, ordered by Leopold I. In 1688-89 maps of Carinthia and Carniola were published; and in 1699 the so-called \" Viscontis war map\" of Transylvania, compiled from the land survey. Improvements in map-making date from the commencement of the"], [273, "AUSTRIA-HUNGARY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 265 eighteenth century, and a map of the Bohemian land survey was copper engraved at Augsburg in 1726. About this time the survey of Moravia and Silesia was commenced, and maps therefrom published at Niirnberg. In 1720 the survey of Lombardy (scale 1:72,000, 21 sections) was commenced, the map therefrom (scale 1 : 90,000, 9 sheets) was copper engraved and published at Milan in 1717. Surveys for war maps were executed in Transylvania in 1733-34. Continuous war now intervened to suspend topographic surveying. The survey of the Tyrol was begun in 1760, and a map therefrom (scale 1 Vienna inch rr German mile) was published (1769 to 1774) in 23 sheets. This was extended over Vorarlberg, completed and published in 1783. Commencing in 1762, measurements were commenced in Austria and Northern Italy, intending to connect with France, looking to the deter mination of the spheroidal figure of the earth and the length of a meridianal arc. Maps resulting (7 or 8 sheets) were published in Milan in 1796. The military surveys, during the last half of the eighteenth century, were conducted under the Quartermaster-General. On the ground that a lack of proper topographic maps may lead to serious disasters in time of war, surveys of Moravia, Silesia, and Bohemia were begun in 1764, since which time the land survey has been exclusively executed by officers of the army. Prior to this time army officers had also been detailed for geodetic operations in Bohemia, Hungary, Transylvania, &c. At the close of 1787, under Emperor Joseph II, every Austrian prov ince had been mapped, but not with that accurate connection required for the compilation of the general map of the entire monarchy ; Emperor Francis II, therefore, ordered a new survey. From 1792 to 1800 maps for military purposes only were issued by the General Staff, since which the surveys were made with a view to answer for all technical and scientific purposes as well. Upon the inauguration of the Cis-alpine Republic (1800) a Ministry of War (Dipartimento della guerra) was established at Milan, and connected with it an institution called \" De posite della guerra,\" similar to the \" De\"p6t de la Guerre\" of France, to collect and preserve maps, plans, and all other topographic material. At the"], [274, "266 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. same time a Military Topographical Corps (called \" Engineer Geographers)\" was formed, to which were attached officers of the Engineer Corps (Corps du Ge\"nie) of the Franco-Italian army. The duties of the corps, as ordained in the decree of July 8, 1800, consisted in the detailed topographic surveying of the Republic, in draw ing plans, in reconnaissances and description of military positions and exami nations of strategic lines of operation leading into surrounding States. In time of war this corps' had to assist the General Staff of the Army in all topographic works. A few engravers were attached (March 15, 1802) when the \"Cis-alpine\" became the \"Italian\" Republic. The \"Deposite della guerra\" formed, in point of fact, a topographic institute at Milan until 1814, when Austria took possession of the country, up to which date the \" Engineer Geographers \" were intrusted with all trian gulatioris, field-surveying, and reconnaissances, and the depot with the drawing and engraving of the maps. The trigonometric net of Lombardy was connected (1814) with the triangulation of Piedmont, and that of the Romagna, and extended to the Adriatic, upon which as a basis there were compiled and copper engraved the following maps: 1. Administrative map of Italy (scale 1:500,000, 8 sheets). 2. Administrative map of Illyria (scale 1:500,000, 9 sheets). 3. Map of Etruria (scale 1:200,000, 6 sheets). 4. Map of Upper Italy (scale 1:100,000, 1 sheet). 5. Post-route map of Italy (scale 1 : 280,000, 4 sheets). Preparations had, also, advanced for a topographic map of Italy and a hydro graphic chart of the Adriatic. There were drawn, engraved, and published from 1814 to 1839 \u2014 1. Special map, Lombardy and Venice (scale 1:86,400, 42 sheets). 2. Topographic map of Milan and vicinity (scale 1:49,968, 4 sheets). 3. Topographic map of Padua, Placenza,and Guostalla (scale 1 : 86,400, 9 sheets). 4. General map of Austria (scale 1 : 86,400, 9 sheets). 5. General map of Italy (scale 1 : 1,800,000, 4 sheets). 6. Road map of Western Alps (scale 1 : 720,000, 2 sheets). 7. Atlas ofthe Adriatic (31 sheets). After the Austrian occupation the \" Deposito della guerra\" was con tinued under the name \" I. R, Istituto Geografico Militare,\" reorganized, placed under the quartermaster-general, and declared a permanent institu-"], [275, "A USTRIA- HUNGARY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 267 tion. The officers of the topographic corps were attached to the quarter master-general's staff and their names placed on the army register. An annual dotation of 7,000 florins was settled on the institution, and it was also ordained that it should remain in Milan, until all topographic works in Lombardy, Venice, Parma, Modena, and Lucca, and the coast survey of the Adriatic were completed. At the close of the first quarter of the present century the general interest in geographical knowledge, incited by the writings of Humboldt, Ritter, and others, and particularly as the art of war had become more com plicated, influenced the Government of Austria to concentrate all of this sort of available means into one institution. There had existed in Vienna since 1806 a topographic institute and a topo-lithographic office of the quartermaster-general's staff since 1818. By an imperial order (January 7, 1839,) of Ferdinand I, the \"I. R. Istituto Geografico Militare\" was transferred from Milan to Vienna, and consolidated with the institute of that place under the name of the \" K. K. Militar Geographisches Institut.\" This order says \"that this Institute shall constitute by itself an individual whole, answering the purposes which its name indicates, that it shall be located in a suitable building, and shall take among similar institutions of other countries a worthy place, and that sufficient means to insure its progress in art and science shall be provided for.\" Referring to its duties it says, \" It sliall be the duty of the Institute to produce and compile all data necessary for the construction of maps and sea charts by astronomic and geodetic operations, and also by military land surveys, which shall, in conformity with the requirements of the age, answer scientific as well as military, and, as much as possible, administra tive, purposes \"; further, \" all military drawings and other similar works re quired from time to time in the service, and finally the revision and correc tion of the land surveys which may be caused by changes in roads, water courses, bridges, &c, are to be executed by this Institute.\" The first map of Austria was published in 1667 (scale 1:144,000, 6 sheets), a copper engraved map (25 sheets) was constructed in 1726, under direction of Jordan Mtiller, an engineer officer of the Austrian army, which was long held as a standard work."], [276, "268 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The Empress Maria Theresa ordered May 3, 1764, the military sur vey of Bohemia. These surveys were made without a preceding triangulation, and based on Midler's map, enlarged to 1:28,800, the scale on which the military sur veys were executed and which was retained until 1872, when it was changed to 1:25,000. Scarcely had the survey been completed (1787) when anew and accurate survey (scale 1:28,800) was ordered by Emperor Joseph II. These surveys, referred to various initial meridians, could not be con nected into one map of the country. A totally new survey was therefore ordered in 1807, and the military mapping was carried over the whole country. The old scale of 1:28,800 was adhered to. The astronomic and geodetic operations may be divided into four periods : 1. From first triangulation in 1762 to end of century. 2. From 1806 to 1829. 3. Primary triangulation (Austria entire) from 1839-1860, with meas urements of base lines for military and cadastral mapping. 4 Those of later years, for the European degrees measurements and surveys with level curves for new special map of Austria-Hungary, scale 1:75,000. First and Second Periods. \u2014 The first triangulation was commenced in 1762 (ordered by Empress Maria Theresa), and continued during the second period to the meridian of Ofen, and a chain of triangles carried over the Carpathians eastward to Transylvania and the triangulation of North Italy begun. In connection with the French degree measurements of 1821-23, Austrian officers took a part in the geodetic operations in Upper Italy. Third Period. \u2014 The new primary triangulation of the entire empire was completed in 1860. The triangulation of Central Italy occurred in 1841-43, and that of Wallachia during and after the occupation of 1855-57. Fourth Period. \u2014 At the instance of General Baeyer in 1861, a union of the Central European States for purposes of joint geodetic operations was effected. This union originally called the (\" Mittel Europaische"], [277, "AUSTRIA-HUNGARY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 269 Gradmessung\") Central European degrees measurements, became in 1867 what is now known as the (\" Europaische Gradmessung\") European degrees measurements to which all the European States contribute, with the excep tion of England (the astronomic geodetic operations of the United Kingdom being complete), Servia, Montenegro, Greece, and Turkey. MILITARY MAPPING. Since the seventeenth century surveys have been exclusively under taken by the Imperial Government. Prior to this date both the general and provincial governments subsidized private individuals, who were afterwards employed regularly by the Gov ernment. Soon, however, officers of the army were detailed for this work. Under Leopold I officers of the engineers (Corps du Ge'nie) executed geodetic operations. After the seven-years war the land survey was placed under the direc tion of the General Staff. Silesia was surveyed in 1763, and the surveys of Bohemia and Moravia were begun in 1764. No triangulation was made; Midler's special map, enlarged to 1:28,800, being used as the base. The instructions were \"to enumerate all houses and cattle, to describe rivers and roads, to represent mountains according to their height, and to particularly indicate those which afford the greatest view of the surround ing country.\" The collection of statistical data was intrusted to officers specially selected. The surve3~s of these provinces were completed in 1768. That of Marmaros was commenced in the same year, and Emperor Joseph II ordered those of Banate, Sclavonia, Banal, and Transylvania to be commenced in the following year after the same plan, and thus all the provinces, including Hungary, were to be surveyed in quick succession. Scarcely were these surveys completed than preparations for a more accurate survey (scale 1:28,800) were commenced. The chief fault of these so-called \" Josephinian surveys\" was the want of a general triangulation net-work as a basis, so that when, in 1792, it was attempted to complete them into a general map, the distortion along the borders rendered it impossible."], [278, "270 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. This fact induced Francis II to order an entirely new survey. War with Napoleon interrupted the work, wliich was taken up after each dec laration of peace. This survey, covering the whole monarchy, was commenced in 1807, and the maps were made partly from plane-table measurements (based on already completed triangulation) and partly by reductions from cadastral sheets, and to the scale of 1:28,800=1 Vienna inch \u2014 400 Vienna Klafter. GEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE. Upon the organization of the State Geological Institute, November 15, 1849, it was found that the maps then being produced at the scales of 1:86,400 and 1:144,000 had in forty years covered only about one-third of the entire area, thus requiring eighty years for completion at the rate and by the means then employed, while it was contemplated that the work of tbe Geological Institute should be completed in thirty years. A commission of experts from the Departments of Agriculture and Com merce, Railroads and Telegraphs, General Staff; and Military Geographical Institute was formed, who recommended an additional appropriation to the Geographical Institute and the formation of a separate corps of engineer geographers; the military mapping to be executed at the scale of 1:28,800; the publication ofthe special map at 1:144,000; the general map at 1:288,000, and the cadastral survey at the usual scale of 1:2,880, and the work duly hastened. This recommendation was adopted and the organization ofthe \"Engi neer-Geographers\" begun, which corps was afterward abolished in 1861. THE MAPPING OF WALLACHIA (1:57,600), executed in 1856-57, has been considered, as regards detail and execution, as one of the best pieces of workmanship. This was done at the request of the Wallachian Government by a corps of over one hundred engineers, and embraces 765 square myriameters. It furnished as well a triangulation basis for the cadastral survey and a general map of the country engraved on copper. An entirely new resurvey of the Monarchy was ordered September 11, 1872, which, withmuch improved methods of representation, is still inprogress-"], [279, "271 AUSTRIA-HUNGARY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. scale 1:75,000, 720 sheets), and to be completed in 1886. The scale of 1:28,800 was changed to 1:25,000, and that of 1:144,000 was changed to 1 : 75,000, while it is presumed that the cadastral survey remained at 1: 2,880. The trigonometric basis of the cadastral surveys, begun in 1816, re ferred to a system of different meridians, which, while possessing the advantage of local accuracy, were not adapted for compilation in a single connected map. This entered largely into the reason for the resurvey ordered in 18 72. Helio gravure, in place of copper engraving, is being employed in its reproduction. The actual surface covered by the drawing will be 133 square meters, and the entire number of sheets arranged in a single tableau will embrace 244 square meters, or 2,625 square feet. The diameter of a globe of corresponding scale would be 170 meters^: (approximately) 558 feet. This new special map of Austria-Hungary (1:75,000) results from plane-table sheets of 1:25,000 reduced by photography to 1:60,000, then during the heliogravure process to 1:75,000. Five hundred and seventy eight sheets of this map were completed (1885), and the balance of 142 should be finished, say, in 1887. During the four years ending in 1876 204 sheets were issued, or an average of 50 per annum. Independent of cadastral surveys, which for Austria are finished, and in Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina require one and two years longer, respectively, the only land instrumental survey in progress is that above mentioned for the general chart of scale 1:75,000. The work proceeds by virtue of an extraordinary or special annual appropriation of funds other than that delegated to the institute proper, sanctioned in amount by the legislative body both at the Vienna and Buda-pest sittings. This work may be termed a topographic areal survey based on trian gulation. The establishment of the astronomic and geodetic points and of base lines is in pursuance of the requirements approved by the Interna tional Geodetic Commission. The detail is secured principally by the plane-table process, while main lines of levels, appropriately run, form a part of the skeleton bases of the work.

No officer of the army at large will be detailed in the Institute who has not served as such for three years with his command, aud it never happens that civilians are commissioned as officers on account of special qualifications for service iu the Institute. The technical personnel are only taken excep tionally from civil life, being mostly former non-commissioned officers, whose fitness for a given posi tion in the Institute has been proven by long service and theoretical examination.

A more accurate and detailed representation of all means of commu nication, as roads, canals, and particularly of points most important in military operations. 2. The multiple determination of heights by barometric and trigono metric measurements upon wliich to base the equidistant curves (100 meters apart) of the plane-table sheets. 3. Detailed explanations of the topography, especially of those features to be availed of in military operations, representing the monarchy as a continuous whole instead of a number of special maps of the different provinces. The instructions issued in 1869 were in harmony with the above-men tioned points. These instructions, changed and perfected during the first five years, were definitively adopted in 1875. They comprise three parts : 1, technic ; 2, service; and 3, administrative. The decision to reproduce this new map by heliogravure, rather than by hand- engraving on copper, caused a material change in the drawing of the originals ; for in order that the heliographic representation should be equal in artistic finish, clearness, and brilliancy to the copper-plate impres sion, the draftsman must both fully conceive his subject and make a draw ing equal to a fine copper engraving. Thus, by making the new special map an almost exact copy of the original plane-table sheets and the introduction of heliogravure, it was found practicable to execute the entire work in a comparatively short time, and as fast as the material for compilation could be produced by the annual field operations. As a result of the above decision, also, a school for draftsmen was organized, by order of the War Department, which consisted at first of Hti members. The high standard of draftsmanship required to produce suit able originals for the heliogravure process rendered a constant change nec essary before the proper number of competent delineators could be obtained. Hence, the work proceeded less rapidly in the earlier years, 10 sheets only"], [283, "AUSTRIA HUNGARY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 275 having been finished in 1873, while in 1876 the number had reached 82 sheets for the year. The number of draftsmen employed has varied between 58 and 72. The projection is made on the basis of a polyhedron coinciding approx imately with the spheroidal figure of the earth, with border lines of meridi ans and parallels. Lehman's system is followed for the topography, equidistant horizontal curves 100 meters apart being introduced, and intermediate curves where the slope is at an angle less than 10\u00b0. The average working time on one sheet is, for lettering and line-work, 4J months, and for topographical drawing, 7\u00a3 months. In order to produce the stated number of draftsmen employed during the several years (.. e., from 58 to 72), it was necessary to educate 170 per sons. According to ministerial order of 1881, this division is designated as the \" Special Map Drawing Division,\" forming a part of the topographic branch of the institute. While experiments have been made in most, if not all, of the later meth ods of mechanical reproductions and in hand engraving (see \"Die Technik des Reproductions von Militar Karten und Planer\" method of reproduction of military maps and plans, by Major Volkmer), yet the institute has deci ded to reproduce all the principal maps by the heliographic process. The present annual cost of the institute is 760,00s) florins, which in cludes cost of publishing all maps and charts; it was impracticable to learn of the total cost since date of commencement, or of the actual cost averaged according to area of the various surveys that afford the present state of knowledge of the terrain ; an estimate was obtained of the cost of obtaining the field-notes (1:25,000) for the new special map at approximately $400 per square mile. This does not, of course, include the cost of any of the surveys prior to 1872 that had then been in progress, with sundry interruptions, something like 10*> years. No separate estimate appears of cost of triangulation and topography. So far as known, no other branch of the Austrian Government issues"], [284, "276 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. topographic or orographic charts. The only known publications of the Institute other than maps and plans are the yearly report of operations (only begun in 1881) and the list of topographical and geographical terms em ployed upon the Austrian maps, with a translation in German, Croatian, French, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Roumanian, and Slavonic (Schrift-Krk larung zur Special-Karte de \u0152sterr-Unga Monarchie), as also a catalogue of its maps, with a series of index charts. The accu racy of primal astronomic, geodetic and other positions is in keeping with the probable errors found to result from the use of the later improved field instruments, and the formulae employed in the reduction of the observations. The plane-table is now almost exclusively employed for securing de tails. Special surveys are made also of the large cities and towns. The original archives form a part of the administrative possessions of the Ministry of War, and can thus be readily utilized for reproduction of maps of special locations on large scales in event of outbreaks or actual war. The geological survey of Austria, organized in 1850, avails itself of the topographic map of the Institute, both in their field work and in the rep resentation of formations, &c, for the geological map of the kingdom. It is intended that so far as practicable the Institute shall furnish all the maps needed by the various administrative departments of the Government. The principal maps may be found for sale at Vienna and other large places at comparatively small cost. The instructions for the topographic part of the work proper appear in three small pamphlets issued by the Institute, while those for astronomy and triangulation follow the method prescribed by the International Degrees Measurements Commission. The instruments employed are mostly of modern date, manufactured either in Austria or Germany. Astronomic determinations, with meanders of routes, were made by Austrian officers in European Turkey in 1871-75. The material contributes to the map of Central Europe (scale 1:300, 000) embraced by Turkey."], [285, "277 AUSTRIA HUNGARY. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA. (Cadastral.) Shortly after the occupation of these countries by Austria, and after the most pressing administrative measures, such as the census and other enumerations, were completed, the cadastral survey was taken under con sideration. A commission was appointed in December, 1879, wliich com mission adopted a series of instructions for the conduct of the work. That part of this map embracing the Balkan. Mountains has been partly constructed and revised on the basis of reconnaissances executed by the General Staff (1871-74) and upon other official material in the vicinity of the border lines. The force employed in the cadastral survey of Bosnia and Herzego vina consisted in 1882 of 1 director, 1 assistant director, 1 adjutant, 1 ac countant, 6 subdirectors, 7 assistants, 8 clerks, 67 geometers, 134 assistants. Instruction division: 1 geometer instructor, 1 assistant instructor, 12 em ployes to be instructed in field work. This corps, comprising 240 technical members, is assisted during sum mer by a detail of 410 military and 36 civil laborers, and is under the chief direction of the Military Geographical Institute. The area of Bosnia and Herzegovina is 515.6 square myriameters (51,560 square kilometers, or, approximately, 18,562 square miles), of which 149.2 square myriameters, or, approximately, 5,371 square miles had been surveyed at the close of 1881. The size of the plane-table sheets is the same as those for the special map (1:75,000). The usual field scale is 1:12,500, while that for culti vated ground and settlements is 1 : 6,250 and 1 : 3,125, one plane-table sheet, of wliich there are 743, is equal to one-sixteenth of a full sheet (1 : 75,000), and is called a cadaster section, of which 215 had been completed in 1881. The primary triangulation and that for the cadastral survey of the second, third, and fourth order is being continued in these provinces; about 280 plane-table sheets were to be completed in 1882, in the country along the Servian and North Dalmatian frontiers, and the work should be com pleted in 1883. The instructions for the cadastral survey of Bosnia were"], [286, "278 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. decided upon in 1880. No triangulation whatever had been executed in Bosnia prior to 1879. The map of the country issued in 1876 (an extension of Central Eu rope 1 : 300,000) was based on about 80 points, astronomically determined by officers of the Institute in 1868, hence the whole country had to be tri angulated, as a basis both for the military and cadastral map. On the boundaries of the provinces certain base line and triangulation material existed, which was connected with and thus utilized. The plane-table sheets of the cadastral survey were executed at the scale of 1 : 12,500, observing the graduation of the degree sheets of the mili tary map. A degree map sheet is divided into 16 sections, each of which repre sents one plane-table sheet. Each sixteenth is called a cadastral section, which is again divided into 16 parts. Each cadastral section must contain at least 3 trigonometric points, or at the rate of 48 points for each . degree map sheet (about 11 square myriameters). These surveys are nearing completion. In addition to the general map of Central Europe (scale 1:300,000), the Institute issues a skeleton map of Austria, and Hungary, with parts of adjacent countries (scale 1:750,000). There is in course of preparation, based on the (\"Carte de la Grece\") French map of Greece (scale 1:200,000), and on the latest English sea charts, a general map of Greece (scale 1:300,000), forming supplemental sheets of the map of Central Europe. A brief memoir on Austrian Surveys will be found in Chapter IV of Comstock's Notes on European Surveys. A more complete reference to important maps issued by this Institute will be found in the list of maps, in the introduction to Government Surveys. AUSTRIA. Geologic. Before the establishment of a geological institute in Austria, Professor W. von Haidinger, Superintendent of the Mineralogical Museum, belonging"], [287, "279 AUSTRIA\u2014 GEOLOGIC. to the Imperial Court, undertook the foundation of a museum for mountain production, assisted by private enterprise, and in 1847 the first sketch of the geological map of the Empire was published. A number of reports and notices by volunteer geologists had been published by the Academy of Sciences in 1846 from its own funds Fine geological and industrial maps and monographs of rich mineral districts, especially in certain parts of Hungary, the Banat, and of the Military Frontier, also existed at that date. The Institute \u2014 under the title of \"Kaiserlich-Konigliche geologische Reichsanstalt\" \u2014 charged with the geological examination of Austria, was sanctioned by imperial approval of November 15, 1849, of a project sub mitted by the Minister of Agriculture and Mining, and an annual grant of 31,900 florins, with 10,000 florins for preliminary expenses, was conceded. A handsome palace covering 5,000 square meters was leased as an office until 1872, when it was purchased at a cost of 640,000 florins (approxi mating $320,000), which answers also the purpose of library and museum. The Institute has quite a large working library, and as early as 1860 there were 35,000 specimens in the museum, carefully labeled and displayed by provinces. There is also a laboratory for the analysis of minerals and rocks and for the assay of minerals and useful substances, with a special director. The public are permitted to have assays made, pursuant to a fixed tariff. The examination is a purely geological one, including the branches of paleontology and mineralogy, with special investigations upon mining problems without any general plan relating to mining in its entirety. No topographic work is undertaken, the special topographic map of Austria (scale 1:75,000, 720 sheets) serving as the base for geological representa tions, certain measurements of heights and local profiles sometimes being made. The field maps are those of the Military Geographical Institute on various scales, usually the old field minutes (scale 1:28,800), until the new map (scale 1:75,000) was inaugurated, when copies of the plane-table sheets (scale 1:25,000), with equidistant curves of 50 meters and elevations in meters, have been employed to the exclusion of all others. The field notes having been taken on the scale of 1 : 25,000 are afterward transferred"], [288, "280 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. upon printed copies of the new topographic map (scale 1:75,000). An edition of 270 sheets ofthe topographic map (1 : 75,000), geologically col ored, has been published. The first field work was undertaken in 1850, a general exploration concluded in 1857, since which date the work has proceeded at the rate of 150 to 200 German square miles annually, each geologist accomplishing 20 to 30 square miles in a field season. The completion of the work was originally contemplated in thirty years or during 1879, while the statement ofthe director, made in January, 1882, shows, approximately, 5,600 German square miles as completed, leaving unfinished areas in Moravia and Silesia, Styria, Dalmatia, and the western part of Galicia, to the extent of, approx imately, 7,167 German square miles. The jurisdiction of this work extends over Austria alone, Hungary having a separate establishment. The per sonnel of the Austrian Geological Institute in 1 882 was as follows: 1 director, 1 vice-director (in charge of museum), 3 chief geologists, 2 assistant geolo gists, 2 subassistant geologists, 1 chief of chemical laboratory, 1 assistant, 1 draftsman, 2 clerks, 5 messengers and laborers, 3 to 4 volunteers. The expense of the personnel amounts per annum to 33,258 florins, equal, ap proximately, $16,500. The total annual cost given in January, 1882, is 53,811 florins, or, approximately, $2*6,900. There is a single central office at Vienna under Director F. R. von Hauer. In February, 1885, Dr. Hauer resigned, and his successor, Dr. Stur Dionys, formerly Vice-Director, was promoted Director of the Survey. A small revenue from the sale of maps at the office of the Geological Institute is derived, which is returned to the Imperial Treasury. The final maps are colored by hand, as required, instead of being re produced by chromolithography, thus admitting of frequent revisions. It is intended, however, to reproduce imprinted editions when the final detailed revisions are complete. Special publications have been made such as the geological map ofthe whole Empire on the scale of 1 : 576,000 in 12 sheets by chromolithography. The printed publications consist of the annual reports (royal Svo), quarto publications (monographs on special subjects), and the regular proceedings of the Institute in the form of transactions (royal 8vo). This office is empowered to call on the Military Geographical"], [289, "281 HUNGARY AND BOHEMIA\u2014 GEOLOGIC. Institute for special topographic details, sections, &c, when required. Each geologist works individually a given area, guided by his skill and experience. These men are regularly in the employ of the survey and are selected mostly from the university graduates, who are appointed upon the approval of the Minister of Agriculture, and upon the recommendacion of the head of the Institute. The Institute at the expiration of thirty-three years prosecutes its labors with vigor, although in 1859 it was threatened with extinction from motives of economy. HUNGARY. Geologic. Geological examinations were organized in 1868 by the director of the Austrian Geologic \"Reichsanstalt\" (Institute), Hofrath F. R von Hauer, as a special branch ofthe above Austrian institution. Soon after, in 1870, it was reorganized and became a distinct organization under the title \"Konigliche Ungarische Geologische Reichsanstalt\" at Buda-Pest, under the direction of Max von Hantken. In 1882 Johann Bockh was appointed to that position, assisted by a corps of 1 1 geologists and chemists. The examinations are based upon the Austrian staff maps (scale 1 : 75,000), and the geological colors are superposed by hand on the published maps. The maps are accompanied by explanatory text in Hungarian and G.rman. The first publications were issued in 1871 under the title \"Jahresbericht der Koniglichen Ungarischen Geologischen Anstalt,\" and \" Erlaiiterungen zur Geologischen Special-Karte der Lander der Ungari schen Krone.\" Twenty -two sheets of the geological map have already been putlished. The geological bureau at Vienna publishes, in 8vo, a yearly abstract of the operations of this Institute. BOHEMIA. Geologic.

The field work for the general topographic map of the \"Etat-Major\" of the War Ministry of France (scale 1 : 80,000 \u2014 273 sheets) was commenced in 1819, the first publication made in 1833, and the last sheet printed in 1881. The entire area of France, represented by this map, is 205,976 square miles, while the population in 1881 is given as 37,672,048, or an average of (approximately) LS3 per square mile. The survey has been, since 1831, known as that of the \"Etat-Major,\" the name of the central office in Paris having been \"De'pot de la Guerre,\" for wliich the title \"Service Ge\"ogra phique\" has been substituted since Colonel Perrier has been called to its head. This bureau of the War Department of France was organized in 1688, and has been in continuous existence ever since, its present field duties being the revision, once in five years, of the topographic map of France on the scale of 1:50,000, for wliich duty (approximates) 300 officers are almost constantly employed, also the new, original detailed trigonometric and topo graphic map of Algeria (scale 1:50,000, approximating 327 sheets), as well as topographic works in Tunis.* The area of Algeria (now a department of France) is 166,023 square miles (approximately), with a population in 1881 of 3,310,412, or an aver age of 20 per square mile. The following is found in Notes on Government Surveys, by the Eng lish Intelligence Bureau, War Office, London : CIVIL DIVISIONS. France is divided into 87 departments, subdivided into 362 arrondisse ments, again into 2,865 cantons, and again into .55,989 communes. * The various works of this Bureau can be better understood by reference to the catalogue of 1884 aud subsequent bulletins, which show the various works in progress and their state of advance ment."], [292, "284 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Algeria is divided into 3 provinces, and subdivided into 15 depart- ments. MILITARY DIVISIONS. France is divided into 18 military districts (Corps dArrne'e), each mil itary district into 2 divisions, each division into 2 brigades, and each brig ade into 2 regimental districts. Algeria consists of 1 military district (Corps dArrne'e), divided into 3 divisions of 5, 3, and 4 brigades, respectively. The following is a brief sketch of the establishment prior to 1800 : A corps, known as \"Engineers of Camps and Armies,\" was established as early as 1696, the chief of which in 1717 had the rank of brigadier general of infantry. This body asked in 1726 for the title of \"Engineer Geographers of Camps and Armies,\" but their functions in the following war were only adjunctive to the \"Etat-Major,\" and their results went to the \"D(.pot des cartes et plans,\" which existed separately from the \"De'pot de la Guerre.\" In 1744 the \"D^pot des cartes et plans\" and that of fortifications hav ing been united, the \"Engineer Geographers\" were given a stable exist ence. Topography had then made but little progress, the map of Cassini being the finest in France. This map (scale 1:86,400 \u2014 184 sheets, engraved on copper, and pub lished from 1750 to 1793) was the first general map of France based on astronomical observations combined with a triangulation. This project was conceived about the year 1733, commenced some years later under the auspices of the Academy at the expense of the Government and under the special patronage of Louis XV, an amateur in geographical maps. In 1760 the Engineer Geographers were separated from the Bureau of Fortifications. In 1761, the \"Engineer Geographers\" and \"De'pdt des cartes et plans\" were consolidated. The personnel of Engineer Geographers was constituted by royal de cree of April 1, 1769. By ordinance of 1776 they were associated in service Note. \u2014 Tbe \"Metric\" system was instituted in 1795 to supersede the \"Ancient\" system. The \"Systeme Usuel\" was introduced in 1812 as a sort of compromise with those people who showed an irreconcilable aversion to the Metric system, upon which, however, the former was based. The old measures were interdicted by law in 1840."], [293, "285 FRANCE\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. with the Military Engineers, and by that of 1777 the title of \"Geograph ical Military Engineers\" was conferred. In 1791 the \"De\"pot des Fortifications\" was separated from the \"Depot de la Guerre,\" and the functions of the Engineer Geographers merged with those of the Military Engineers. Regulations of 1792 gave a new organization. -The director and his assistants were dispersed in 1793. The Engineer Geographers, attached to the Etat-Major, were again organized, but with a fragile tenure. In 1793 the Depot de la Marine was united to the \" De\"p6t de la Guerre.\" At this period MM. Delambre and Mechain measured and verified the arc of the meridian between Dunkerque and Barcelona. The Committee of Public Safety ordered (1795) several works of mil itary topography, hydrography, and geodesy, for the uses of the armies, upon the coast of the Gulf of Gascony, upon the northern frontiers, those of the Alps, Italy, and Spain, which were made through the \"Depot\" by means of the Geographical Engineers. The \"De\"p6t\" was newly organized (1795 and 1796) and perfected in 1797. This decree pronounced the reunion with the Topographical Cabinet, near the Committee of Public Safety, and placed the map of France in the Ministry of the Interior. Correspondence with the Etat-Major was now re-established. The library was established in 1798. The map of France was returned to the \"De\"pot\" revised and retouched. The results during this period were not highly satisfactory, the Engi neers being poorly trained. A final organization was perfected in 1799, and a special topographical bureau established near the First Consul. The catalogue of the library was finished (1800). In 1801 a map of France, in 9 sheets, was issued and much informa tion obtained from Milan. The Engineer Geographers, under General-in- Chief Moreau, in 1801 undertook the military maps of Suabia and Bavaria, and after the Vienna treaty of peace the latter was continued in common with the electorate."], [294, "286 GOVERNMENT LAND AND M A.RINE SURVEYS. Officers of Engineers in Italy had undertaken the survey of the coun try between the Adige and Adda. The surveys of Helvetia and Piedmont were also begun. A new organization was now proposed, based on the increasing impor tance of the functions of the \"Depot.\" About this date similar establish ments were organized in Vienna and Madrid. The present military chart of France (1:80,000) being revised and issued (1:50,000) was conceived* by Napoleon I in 1808, a project then made and finally put in execution in 1818. The scales of the field minutes and final map were decided upon in 1824, the method of liaehuring in 1828. The primary triangulation was completed in 1845, and the secondary in 1854; the topography was finished some years later, and the last engra ving in 1881. The Engineer Geographers carried on the work until their disband ment in 1831, when it was taken up and completed by the \"Etat-Major.\" This office is intrusted with the preparation and publication of the extended series of military topographical maps, required in War Adminis tration, a list of which will be given further on, which comprises all those issned by the War Department, except a general map (1:500,000) of the fortification branch and special contour maps ofthe sites of and approaches to, works of defense, interior frontier and coastwise. (The latter are held for the confi iential uses of the war arm of the Government.) The personnel up to 1881 had been principally officers of the Corps of Engineer Geographers and of the Etat-Major (a branch of the military service, that has now been disbanded as a permanency, but to the func tion:; of which officers of the line are appointed by selection, for a term of vears), aided by selected enlisted men. This force is naturally, as in all such cases, supplemented by assistants drawn from civil life to aid in ob serving, computation, and the more technical duties. The office forms a part of the \" Etat-Major Ge'nC'ral,\" the chief of which reports direct to the Secretary of War, but with somewhat independent functions and powers of self-control. The following are the principal map publications in course of execution by the \" Service Ge'ographique de lArme'e,\" viz:"], [295, "FRANCE\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIO. 287 WAE DEPAETMENT. 1. Topographic map of France (scale 1:50,000, approximating 1,092 sheets) engraved on zinc, in 6 colors. This map is intended to supersede the \" fitat-Major\" map (scale 1 : 80,000 \u2014 273 sheets), engraved on copper and printed in black. The re sults of the revisionary surveys are incorporated with the new map, the engravings being made on zinc plates, comparatively inexpensive, that become the (\" planchesmeres\") mother plates, that may be preserved and perpetuated indefinitely, while the colors render the map intelligible to a greater number, it having also been found possible to publish them at a cost which renders them accessible to the public. Twenty of these sheets (each corresponding to one quarter sheet at 1:80,000) had been issued in 1885. The scale of 1 : 50,000 was chosen for the new map because of its bearing more simple relations to the metrical divisions than the old scale of 1 : 80,000, and because the reduction from the field minutes of 1 ; 40,000 (demanded by engineers in projects of extensive works), can be made with more facility. Horizontal curves are shown at equidistances of 10 meters. 2. Chorographic map of France (scale 1:200,000,) engraved on zinc in 6 colors. This map (to be completed in 1889) is purely a reduction of the pre ceding and executed by the same method.* * Under date of August 1, 1885, Colonel Perrier remarks as follows regarding the new topo graphic map of France in colors. Military maps must satisfy many conditions: among them the greatest accuracy in projection and construction, iu classification and laying down of routes of communications, with a clearness and facility for reading, available even for poor eyes. The map in colors upon zinc permits the \" De*p6t dela Guerre\" to solve this problem. Zinc gives rapidity in execution and allows the plates easily to be cor rected. As to tbe configuration of the terrain, hachures have been superseded by contours,t relieved by stumped drawing of a bluish-gray shade, with light a trifle oblique, to facilitate the understanding of all forms of the soil. The stumped drawing is executed upon a stippled zinc surface. The results are satisfactory for the map of Algeria, at 1 : 50,000, and for that of France (1 : 200,000). As regards tbe map of France (1 : 50,000), for certain sheets of which surveys of great precision have been utilized, very satisfactory results have been obtaiued. Tbe general leveling of France, admitted in principle but retarded by considerations germane to the budget, will warrant the realiza tion of the project of the \" Service Ge*ographique\" to give to France plane table sheets at 1 : 25,000, and a map in colors (1 : 50,000). tit may here be stated that credit is due to General Noizet, an officer of French Military Engi neers (Corps du Genie Militaire), for having first introduced the use of horizontal curves to represent grouud reliefs in connection with constructions on a large scale (see foot-note, page 242)."], [296, "288 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The production of sheets proceeds in common and these maps bear the same relation to each other as have formerly those of 1 : 80,000 and 1 320,000.

Topographic map of France (scale 1 : 80,000 \u2014 273 sheets), engraved on copper and published iii black, known as the \"Etat-Major\" map and from which a reduction to scale 1:320,000 (33 sheets published also in black), has been made (see also scales of 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 200,000). 4. Topographic map of Algeria (scale 1 : 50,000), engraved on zinc in 7 colors. The surveys of Algeria were only commenced in 1866, after completing entire the field work of the general topographic map us France. They were interrupted by the war of 1870 and again undertaken in 1879. The methods adopted are quite in keeping with those for the new map of France (scale 1 : 50,000), and 23 sheets were completed in June, 1885. Equidistant curves of 10 meters form one of the features of this map. 5. Map of the Department of the Seine (scale 1 : 20,000 in 36 sheets), engraved on zinc in 5 colors. This map is the amplification of the map of the same area from the field minutes (1 : 40,000), in 9 sheets made first by heliogravure, then engraved upon zinc by substituting horizontal curves for the hachures and accommodating the size of the lettering and line work to the new scale. 6. Map of the railroads of France (scale 1 : 800,000 \u2014 9 sheets), en graved on zinc, in 8 colors. This map has been enlarged from the earlier one prepared and published on the scale of 1 : 1,600,000, (engraved on cop per), first amplified by photolithography and chromo-lithography with a view of indicating the line or lines of each company by a special color. It entirely replaces all other editions and was (September 1883) issued to the public. 7. General map of levels of France (scale 1 : 800,000 in 6 sheets), en graved on stone in 3 colors. The following is a part of the legend explan atory of the map and the end proposed by its publication. \" La Carte du nivellement ge'ne'ral de la France a pour objet la re presentation exacte des formes d'ensemble du sol francais; elie met en Evi dence les rapports intimes existant entre l'orographie et l'hydrographie.\""], [297, "289 FRANCE\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. [Translation.] The map showing the general levels of France has for its object the exact representation of the forms entire of French soil ; it shows the intimate relations existing between the orography and hydrography. The level curves are traced at an equidistance of 100 meters. Each curve representing 400 meters equidistance is made heavier than the others. In one corner is placed a \"carton\" of Paris and its environs (scale 1:20,000) to a distance of 12 to 15 kilometers The equidistant curves of 10 meters are shown. 8. Chorographic map of France (scale 1 : 600,000), engraved on copper. This comprises, in 6 sheets, France entire and adjacent country border ing its frontiers, and will become later the basis of a map in 9 sheets of western Europe, extending eastward even as far as\" Berlin and Vienna. This is one of the studies made looking to the reduction of existing data and the establishment of the most perfect generalized chart for France and its political neighbors. 9. Miscellaneous: A map of the Department of the Seine on the scale of 1:80,000 (planimetric), engraved on stone, in 4 colors, has been executed. This map is transferred from the same part of the map of France executed on copper (scale 1 : 80,000). Also medical statistical charts and special pub lications, as ofthe environs of Rouen (scale 1:20,000).

It is engraved on stone, then transferred to copper, printed in 4 colors, and is composed of 15 sheets ; the height of each equals 0m.511, the width 0m.682, and when joined a height of 2m.55 and width of 2m.05. 1366 wh 19"], [298, "290 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. It covers not alone France, but portions of the bordering countries, and it rests upon a groundwork, as nearly accurate as possible of horizontal curves, at equidistances of 100 meters. A proof of one of the sheets pro duced by the heliogravure process was exposed at Venice. This map is published in 3 forms : 1. Complete in hachures with drainage, settlements, means of commu nication, administrative limits, forests, &c. 2. Route map, including the same elements, dropping the hachures. 3. As an oro-hydrographic map. The latter is the same as the first above, with the settlements and means of communication suppressed. Maps of the Engineer Topographical Brigade. The Topographical Brigade of the Military Engineers of France survey on a large scale, with close contours, the ground upon which permanent fortifications are to be constructed, and to the scale of 1 : 10,000 the environment of fortified places or isolated forts to a distance of 10 kilometers (6.8 miles), in order to pro vide a (\"plan-directeur\") directing plan for each of the works of defense.* Surveys (scale 1:10,000). These surveys are executed by the perma nent personnel of the brigade, composed of officers and assistants of the engineers and by officers of all arms detailed for 6 months of each year to the different sections. The minute route measurements are executed by the \" tache'onieter,\" and are based, for the planimetry, upon the trigonometric points established by the \" D<_p6t de la Guerre,\" and for the levels the datum planes of the general leveling of France by the Public Works Department are used. Together with these route measurements are incorporated the reduced cadaster plans, the whole furnishing the data for the construction of the plane-table sheet of the required scale. These plane-table sheets are transferred at the Central Office upon transparent paper, in the form intended for publication, and the requisite number of copies printed in the atelier of the Bureau of Fortification. * A letter from Colonel Perrier of August 1, 1885, states : That the Engineer Brigade, charged with surveys of precisiou at rtthns and yuhns OI* the vicinities of fortified places, was attached to the \" De\"p6t de la Guerre\" by decree of March 16, 18H5.

PUBLIC WOEKS. (Travaux Publiques.) Public Works Ministry: 1. \"National chart\" of France (scale 1 : 200,000, in 141 sheets, with \" Tableau dAssemblage\" or Index Map). This map is authorized by ministerial decree of February 23, 1879, is engraved in 3 colors on copper, and prepared under the direction of M. Cheysson (Direc teur des cartes et plans, Ingenieur en chef des Ponts et Chausse'es). Each sheet is 0m.426 by 0m.30, and represents, relatively, sheet for sheet, twice the area of the military staff map of 1 : 80,000. The boundaries are marked by straight lines at right angles to each other, one system parallel and the other perpendicular to the meridian of Paris. This atlas is prepared with a special view to the execution of public works, indicating with great pre cision all kinds of means of communication ; also all physical, agricultural, industrial, or administrative features influencing in any way interior trans portation. It shows mineral workings, the population of villages of 1,000 and upward, hydraulic works, exceeding 50 hectares in area, equidistant horizontal curves of 100 meters, and altitudes of remarkable points above the Mediterranean at Marseilles. The most recent surveys and corrections made by engineers \" des Ponts et Chausse'es\" have been utilized, as well as the revision work under the \" Etat-Major,\" that of Military Engineers, Engineers of Mines, and Road Trustees. The same projection as that employed for the map, of 1 : 80,000, has been adopted, i. e., that of \" Bonne\" or the \" Flamsteed modi fied.\" The \" fitat-Major\" map of 1 : 80,000 (273 sheets) is the \" mere nour rice\" of this and all the other general topographic or orographic maps (as well as all other planimetric and generalized maps compiled and constructed for various purposes) of France of every description."], [300, "292 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The railroad details are taken from tracings on a large scale, indicat ing culverts, bridges, tunnels, station structures, with single or double track. The routes in construction are so shown that by an additional con ventional notation, so that the line when finished may be easily added. As to the canals and rivers, their trace is accompanied by indications of dams, sum mit levels, feeding reservoirs, weirs, ferries, and fords. Routes of commu nication of every nature are shown. In the vicinity of each meteorological observatory very valuable data are noted concerning questions of inundation, feeding reservoirs, manage ment of waters, &c. Under the name of each \" commune\" is stated its population, if more than 500, and an indication of the metallurgical works, and the mineral and oil explorations ; for the former there being conven tional signs for iron, copper, lead, &c, and the latter showing the area of the concession and of the basin so far as known. In turn, the light-houses, beacons, &c, are noted, as well as the sources of mineral waters and all forests exceeding an area of 400 hectares. All places of 5,000 inhabitants and upwards are figured with an actual plan to the 1 : 200,000 scale. The orographical details consist of hatched lines of ridges, numbers of altitudes, and level curves. The number of altitudes is something like 300 to 400 for each sheet. The horizontal curves are at equidistances of 100 meters, every fifth curve made more prominent. The graphic equidistance between 2 curves upon a gradient of 45\u00b0 is one-half millimeter (0.02 inch). Black is employed for lettering roads, railroads and tramways, forests and territorial limits ; blue for drainage, ferries, hydraulic works, amount of rainfall, &c, \"bistre\" (a brown) to the strictly topographical part (alti tudes, ridges, and level curves). A \"tableau d'assemblage\" or index sheet indicates each separate sheet by a number and the name of the principal locality it contains. Nine sheets with a \"tableau d'assemblage\" were exhibited, and 25 sheets had been issued at end of 1882."], [301, "FRANCE\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 293 It was stated (in 1881) that 60 more sheets were then in course of prep- aration.

The navigable ways administered by the state or granted to private parties, the canalized rivers, together with the fluvial and maritime navigation at the mouths of rivers, are shown by special tints. The luminous range of the light-houses has also been added to this chart. E. Chart of national roads (scale (1 : 1,390,000), in 4 colors. With the exception of the two first this series of maps has been executed by chromolithography. These charts are sold by different booksellers at very moderate prices, and are thus within the reach of the general public. The plates and sterotypes belong to the Government and are undergoing constant revision. Albums of graphic statistics (1879 and 1880). The system of graphic statistics is of comparatively recent date, but the scope of its application is"], [302, "294 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. becoming daily extended, as it meets the twofold want of accuracy and expedition, in supplying required information. The first album of 1879 contains 12 plates referring to the tonnage of rivers, canals, and ports; natural roads and railways; railway receipts; financial history of various railroad companies ; arrivals and departures of vessels, and the general and special commerce of France. The album of 1880, containing 16 plates, relates to the following sub jects in addition to much of the above : Gross and net receipts of railways ; gross receipts of stations; conditions of navigability of water-ways ; receipts of Paris omnibusses, tramways, passenger steamers, and suburban railways; technical conditions of establishment of railroads ; cost of construction of railroads ; cost of first establishment of navigable ways; maintenance of com munications of all descriptions; development of railways, &c. Atlas of Canals. \u2014 This work was initiated by ministerial circular of November 29, 1854 The plan of each canal is on the scale of 1 : 200,000, with longitudinal section, on the same scale for lengths, and with heights to the 1:1,000 scale ; the plan and section corresponding on each sheet. The size is 0m.60 by 0m.90, and 89 plates compose the collection, which are engraved on stone, and an edition of 300 copies printed. The total expense has been 60,000 francs, or 674 francs per plate, mak ing the cost of a single copy of the collection 200 francs, or 2 francs and 25 centimes for each sheet. Two indexes are found at the beginning of the atlas; the first giving the canals arranged by a series; the second containing the names arranged alphabetically. Annexed to the atlas is found a chart of internal navigation, with figured maps representing tonnage, &c. This atlas (an inventory of the system of navigation) will be enlarged as further navigable ways are de veloped. Atlas ofthe Ports of France. \u2014 This will consist of a portfolio of charts and plans (scale 0m.0075 or 1:133,333) of 163 plates (0m.0002 or 1:5,000) and eight volumes of notices."], [303, "295 FRANCE\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. This publication was ordered by ministerial decision of October 24, 1868, and a commission appointed to direct its execution. In addition to the plans are the charts, at once hydrographic and terri torial, representing the land-fall of principal harbors and their communica tion with the interior, and notices respecting approaches, nautical conditions, the successive development, present state, and statistics of each of the ports. Four volumes of text have been published and plans of ports from Dun kirk to mouth of the Loire, with isolated notices of the ports of Boulogne, Dieppe, Havre, Rouen, Hontieur, Cherbourg, Granville, Saint Malo, Mor lai, Brest, and L'Orient. The engraving of plans of other ocean and Mediter ranean ports is advancing to completion. The charts, plans, and notices of the atlas may be purchased at Paris and the principal ports, at prices fixed by the Administration. There were exhibited at Venice 4 special charts of alluvial river basins (the Loire, Rhone, Sadne, and Garonne). The former,\" 1:20,000; the others, 1:10,000.

MINISTEY OF THE INTEEIOE. Map of France. \u2014 (Scale 1:100,000.) Engraved on stone, transferred to copper, and printed in 5 colors (prepared under the direction of Mr. E. Anthoine, Directeur de la Carte de France et du Statistique Graphique). This map, based upon the topographic map of the \" Etat-Major,\" has added details obtained by the Parish Road Service of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of agents aggregating 5,000, being spread over the entire territory of France. This work was begun in 1879 to be terminated in 1889 (10 years). The cost to May, 1882, had been about 300,000 francs ($60,000), with an annual expenditure of 150,000 francs ($30,000), taken from the appropriation for parish roads, allotted by the Minister of the In terior and the \" Conseil d'fitat.\" This map has been the outgrowth of the construction of parish roads begun in 1868, and endowed by the state in 1879 and 1880, with"], [304, "296 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 380,000,000 francs, admitting of the construction of 12,000 kilometers of new roads annually. The charts of the various administrative departments created under existing laws, when reunited at the Exposition of 1878, showed so many varying scales and methods of representation that a plan was subsequently adopted for the unification of these works. It is claimed that the scale of 1 : 100,000 (1 centimeter to 1 kilom eter) has the advantage of allowing a perfectly clear grouping of the most complete data, and lends itself to a \u2022 rapid estimate of distances, for which purpose a scale of kilometers supplemented by one of marine miles for the coast regions is given on each sheet. Blue is employed for water and altitudes ; green for woods and forests; red for routes, roads, and population ; black for all other parts of the planim etry and lettering; the color \"mine de plomb\" for the reliefs. When the map was established the principal aim seems to have been to produce a sort of dictionary of routes and roads, which called only for planimetric representation, to which was added in 1881 the relief of the \"terrain,\" with numerous indications of altitudes. Different designations indicate administration limits, the letters of differ ent kinds of localities, R. R. of public utility (simple or double track), with all the artificial constructions, viaducts, passages superior, inferior, or level, their tunnels and stations, the tramways, routes national and departmental, parjsh roads of large and ordinary interest, rural roads, the woods and forests with forest paths and wastes, altitudes, water-courses, lakes, and ponds, marshes, turf-pits, &c. The number of population, post and tele graph offices, churches, farms, wind and water mills, forges, foundries, and other manufactories, light-houses and beacons, mineral and thermal waters, are indicated by special signs. Each sheet bears a legend complete. The polycentric projection is employed. Each sheet embraces 30' in longitude and 15' in latitude. The lengths of the meridians and parallels forming the borders are inscribed on the face of each sheet. The size of the sheets, vertically, varies between Om.349 and 0m.419, and horizontally between 0m.278 and Om.277, and is found convenient. The"], [305, "FRANCE\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 297 cost of each sheet ready to print has been found to be (approximately) 1,000 francs. It is found that as high as 16 to 24 sheets can be united to form a departmental map. The enumeration of the sheets is made by a double table, with Roman figures in the vertical and Arabic in the horizontal col umns. The total number of sheets will be 590. In May, 1882, 90 sheets were issued and for sale by Hachette & Co., Paris, and 77 were being engraved. The year of the printing is stamped on each sheet, and a little diagram in the upper right-hand corner gives the parts of the departments of which the map is composed as a sub-index. MINISTEY OF AGEICULTUEE. Detailed colored charts based on the \" Etat-Major\" field minutes of 1:40,000 were exposed at Venice, showing the disposition of woods and forests and their rehabilitation, being types of originals prepared for the uses of the Forest Department. MINISTEY OF POSTS AND TELEGEAPHS. General maps, showing the network of post routes and telegraph lines in France and Algeria, prepared for the uses of this administrative branch of the Government, were also displayed at Venice. Proposed plan for Map of France, scale 1:10,000: By decrees of Octo ber 5 and December 20, 1878, there was appointed, under the Presidency of the Minister of Public Works, a central commission, composed of dele gates of this Ministry and that of the War and Interior, for determining the bases of a general unified and detailed trigonometrically based topographic survey. This commission drew up a plan for a new general survey of France, intended to be of greater precision, with systematic leveling suffi ciently in detail for a map of 1 : 10,000. This work was to result from the joint action of the above ministries, assisted with funds from the \"Depart ment,\" requiring in addition an estimated sum from the General Budget of France of 3,500,000 francs. So far as known, the Chambers have not yet granted an appropriation. In the whole, it would appear that the Gov ernment of France has more map makers than material for maps, yet one"], [306, "298 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. cannot be but interested in the development to which cartographical labors have been carried in this highly interesting country; and the systematic and detailed basis of the primal topographic map having been secured by a single branch, charts devoted to special subjects needed in other admin istrative branches are readily compiled and constructed therefrom. To return to the \" Etat-Major\" Topographic Chart, or the mother map of France, it appears that the field revision work for the 1:50,000 scale is to be completed in 1882. There are 250 to 300 officers engaged on this work in the several military departments. A re-revision, each succeed ing 5 years, is contemplated. There are also 5 geodesists and from 50 to 60 officers employed in the current Algerian work, the Paris office having cognizance of all. The Algerian work costs about 60,000 francs ($12,000) annually, inde pendent of salaries of officers and pay of enlisted men. The total budget (annual) is now 684,800 francs for the entire \"Service Geographique,\" the importance of which is again being better recognized, and growing in utility since the Franco- Prussian war. Other than the Paris office, which has 5 subdivisions \u2014 (1) Geodesy, (2) Topography, (3) Carto graphy, (4) History and Statistics, (5) Accountability \u2014 there are none others except field offices of the most temporary character.* * There have been added since January 1, 1883, the following : (a) School of design. This school was created at the \"Depdt de la Guerre\" by ministerial decision of April 29, 1883 ; the admission of pupils to the number of 10 for 18S4 and 5 for the following years, has been decided by competitive examination. The pupils are exercised in the reduction and reproduction of topographic designs of all scales, after models and reliefs. These works are executed in curves, in stippled hachures, or tinted shading. In view of heliographic reproduction, the scholars are particularly drilled in uniformity of design for all species of writing (capitals, roman, italics, &c). A course of elementary mathematics, geography, and topography is taught by an officer ; the latter is made perfect by a series of surveys, in different scales, executed upon the ground. This school has produced good results. (6) Heliogravure. An atelier of heliogravure was organized during 1884 ; the reproductions are very satisfactory and economical. (c) Section of control. This section, established in 1884, is under [he immediate direction of the Director, and charged with the examination of proofs before going to press, and indicating the final changes, comparisons, and perfection of the whole. The Historic section has been transferred to the second bureau of the General Staff of the War Ministry."], [307, "FRANCE\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 299 In the revision the cost of drawing and engraving has been found to be 500 francs for 1 decimeter square. No exact figures, so far as is known, are available to show the cost of the entire original survey, 1:80,000. The Director states the field cost of the survey of Algeria (1 : 50,000) to be 20 francs. per square kilometer; with a cost for reproduction of 40 francs, making a total of 60 francs per square kilometer (approximately $31 per square mile). The surveys of precision ofthe Engineer Brigade (1 : 10,000 and 1 : 20,000) are stated to cost about 100 francs per square kilometer (approximately $52 per square mile). The area of four of the new sheets (1 : 50,000) is equivalent to that of one sheet 1:80,000. The publications of this service other than maps are the \"Memorial du De'pot Ge'ne'ral de la Guerre,\" of which eleven 4\u00b0 volumes have been issued to date. All maps issued by the \"Dep6t de la Guerre\" are sold at a uniform cost (reduced to a minimum), to citizens as well as soldiers The sale is effected directly by accredited booksellers at Paris and in the Provinces, who are allowed 25 per cent, of the sale price.

The geological map of France is based- on the topographic chart of the \"Etat-Major\" at the scale of 1:80,000 (see geological map of France). As has been stated the Departments of Public Works and Interior, es pecially, also those of Agriculture and Post Routes, make use of the mate rial originally gathered by the Military De'pot."], [308, "300 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Special instructions govern the revisional work in France, as well as the initial and original geodetic and topographic work in Algeria, and blank forms for all the requisite observations and computations, have been pre pared as the result of the long experience of this branch. The instruments are of excellent quality and high finish, both portable and durable, it being specially noticed that the horizontal and vertical arcs have been reduced in diameter over old forms, resort being had to read ing microscopes of correspondingly high power. The measurement of an arc of the great circle, passing sensibly through the meridian of Paris, has been continued well beyond the coast, southward into the interior of Algeria. As a d<ip6t for the collection of topographic material outside of French territory, this branch of the war service of France ranks high with similar institutions of the kind at Berlin, Vienna, and Madrid. It may here be mentioned that a Bureau of International Exchanges has lately been estab lished within the Ministry of Public Instmiction and Fine Arts for the pur pose of facilitating the interchange of official documents and publications of all foreign countries adhering to the regulations proposed. FRANCE. ( Geologic.) Excluding the first attempts at mapping the minerals of France by Coulon in 1664, by Guettard in 1746, and by Monnet in 1780, the first geologolical examination of France was undertaken by d'Omalius d'Halloy, from 1803 to 1814. The latter worked privately until 1810, when he was commissioned by the Bureau of Statistics, under the direction of the Mining Engineer Coquebert de Montbret, to make a mineralogical map of the Empire, which then extended from the Germanic Sea and the Rhine to Rome and Illyria. The political changes of 1814 stopped this work, and it was not until 1822 that the first geological map of France was published under the title, Essai d'une carte geologique de la France, des Pays-Bas et de quelques contrees voisines, par J. J. d'Omalius d'Halloy. A reproduction of this map was issued by the \"De'pot de la Guerre Belgique\" in 1878. As soon as it was"], [309, "301 FRANCE\u2014 GEOLOGIC. published (1822) the French Government took measures to inaugurate a geological examination on a larger scale. The Minister of Public Works placed the work under the direction of Brochant de Villiers, Inspector- General of Mines and Professor of Geology at the School of Mines. It was not until 1825 that the two Mining Engineers, Dufre'noy and filie de Beaumont, commenced to gather field data, and after 15 years of labor they were able to present, in 1840, the \" Carte geologique de la France,11 scale 1 : 500,000, accompanied by a first quarto volume of explanatory text, issued in 1841, containing a reduced map (Tableau d'assemblage), scale 1 : 2,000,000. A second volume of explanatory text was published in 1848 ; the fourth volume on Paleontology appeared in 1 878, but the third volume has not yet been issued. * > This map, in 6 sheets, was undertaken for the purpose of serving as a guide for those engaged in the study and exploitation of mines. The exploit ation of mines had been conducted heretofore at a venture ; since which it is stated that they have been made with discernment and more frequently crowned with success. The labors of these engineers appear to have given a new direction to geology. This science has in consequence acquired a degree of certainty hitherto unknown in France. Agriculture has been also benefited by the relations which they have established between the soil and subsoil and the geological constitution of the different parts of France. It was only found possible to trace the distinct geological formations under the name of \"terrains.\" To render it equally applicable to agricultural and mineral industry it was necessary that it should illustrate the different rocks as well as the different \"terrains\" or formations. It was thought, after the first geological examination had been com pleted, that departmental geological maps should be made. This provision has been realized in great part, and later maps, executed at the expense of the General Council of each department, have been confided to Engineers of Mines and to other competent persons. But their authors, having been placed at separate points of view, there resulted various scales and distinc tions as to conventional tints without sufficient analogy or uniformity as to systems of classification. Messrs. Dufrenoy and Beaumont thought to unite upon a single map all these isolated works, and chose for the execution of"], [310, "302 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEVS. the detailed geological map of France, the new topographic map of the Etat-Major (1 : 80,000 \u2014 273 sheets). They commenced with the actual por tion comprising the seven departments in the north of France. The work of co-ordination was found very difficult. A new system of division had to be adopted. The unpublished notes of the authors were consulted, and new explorations when necessary made. This map, composed of 20 sheets, was colored geologically in manu script, and exhibited at the Paris International Exhibition of 1855. At the Paris Exhibition of 1867 other sheets were added, amounting in all to 62, representing the north and northeast of France, or what is commonly called the \"Bassin de Paris\" This value of such geological maps on a large scale being admitted, the French Government ordered, October 1, 1868, the execution of \"La carte geologique detaillee de la France,11 with Elie de Beaumont as Director. At his death the Service de la carte geologique detaillee was entirely remodeled and organized on a different basis. On January 21, 1875, a commission was appointed to advise the Director. _ There has resulted a partial publication of the detailed geological map of'France (scale 1 : 80,000), of which 75 sheets were issued during the 11 years commencing in 1873. The work is engraved on stone and printed chro molithographically (until 1876 the coloring was made by hand), the copper engraved topographic plates of the geographical service of the War De partment serving as a base. The average number of sheets hereafter should be 14 each year. The work proceeds under the directorship of Monsieur Jacquot, Inspector-General of Mines, and is known as the \" Service de la carte Ge'ologique,\" the director reporting directly to the Minister of Public Works. The personnel consists of 11 professional geologists and others at the main office at Paris, with 42 collaborators, serving without salary, an al lowance being made for traveling expenses. All of these persons take the field annually, returning to Paris to work up their notes, which, when laid down upon printed copies ofthe \"Etat-Major\" map, are turned over to the engraver, who prepares the originals ready for printing in colors, the latter work being done at the extensive establishment of Lemercier at Paris."], [311, "303 FRANCE\u2014 GEOLOGIC. The present annual cost is 80,000 francs (approximating $16,000), for field and office and for the map. The total present cost has approxi mated 900,000 francs, with a probable cost in all for France entire of 2,000,000 francs, approximating $400,000. The only instruments em ployed, other than those for the simple measurements for dip and strike, are barometers for levels of special points. The usual edition of maps is 500 copies, which are sold at the rate of about 6 francs each. There were sold in 8 years of the Paris map 400 copies, and a larger number of that em bracing Bologne, on account of the projected submarine railway. The publications, other than the special ones on the subjects of Pale ontology and Petrography, are the monographs of the several districts into which France has been geologically divided, one volume for each. In ac cordance with the decree of January 21, 1875, advantage was taken ofthe advice of a commission, aiming at possible reforms in the service. A con sulting commission of 12 members was subsequently established, to give its opinion on questions concerning the execution of the map. The direc tor is obliged to submit a report of operations for the year just past and a project for the incoming year. The organization of the service was in the main preserved, and the door opened to talented geologists from all parts of the country. Assistants (volunteers) were chosen in the various counties, and a personnel as above stated resulted. New instructions govern the taking of field-notes for the new map (1:80,000), in which the general disposition and scale of colors, already adopted, has been maintained, and the number of conventional signs employed reduced to 100. The notes are usually taken at the scale of 1 : 80,000, but in more interesting or intricate districts, at the scale of 1:40,000 (upon the war-service maps with curves), or even at a larger scale. The number of copies issued has increased from two to five hundred. Various special maps have been issued, as the Hydrologic Map of the Department of the Seine (scale 1:25,000), Map of the Subterranean Hy drology of Beauve; also Agronomical Map ofthe Environs of Paris, scale 1:40,000; also the Departments of Seine and Marne from 1864-78. There are also several geologico-agronomical maps of various \"arrondissements,\""], [312, "304 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. issued, and in the course of execution by various authors, and especially of the Department of the Isere, 4 maps, showing as follows: (1) Geological formations. (2) Agricultural lands. (3) Agricultural regions. (4) Classes of cultivation. This work, on a modest appropriation, is being carried on with vigor. ALGERIA. Geologic. The geological examination is directed by the Corps of Mines, its actual director being M. Pouyanne, Engineer-in-Chief of Mines. Several impor tant memoirs, with detailed geological maps, were published between 1850 and 1 880. Recently has appeared a geologic map at the scale of 1 : 800,000, in 5 sheets, under the title of \"Carte Ge'ologique provisoire des provinces d'Alger, d'Oran, et de Constantine,\" par MM.

The Confederation of Switzerland, with an area of 15,978 square miles and population of 2,846,102 in 1880 (average per square mile 178), is pro ceeding with the preparation of a topographic map of the territory in 561 sheets, 442 at the scale of 1:25,000 for the valley parts, and 119 at 1:50,000 for the mountain region. The publication of this atlas is intrusted to the (Bureau Topographique Fe'de'rale) Federal Topographic Bureau of the General Staff at Berne, with a Colonel of the Corps of Military Engineers at its head, according to the authority of the following act of the Confederacy of December 18, 1868: Article 1. The Confederation undertakes the publication of the topographical surveys at the original scale, and makes appropriations for defraying their cost ac cording to the following provisions. Art. 2. The publication must proceed upon a common plan. The issue of each sheet must procevd by a revision or reworking of the original survey sheet. Art. 3. The publication of the atlas shall only take effect when public depart ments, societies, or private parties legally bind themselves to pay half of the first cost of engraviug aud printing."], [313, "305 S WITZERL AN D\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. Art. 4. The succession in the publication of the sheets will be governed accord ing to the contracts (Art. 3) made. Art. 5. The federal council is charged with the execution of this act. The following act was also passed the same day: An Act regulating the continuation of the topographical survey. Article 1. The topographical survey and mapping of the territory of the Con federacy, shall be proceeded with in all Cantons in which there has been no regular topographical survey hitherto made. Art. 2. The survey is to be made on a scale of 1:25,000. The cost of the work shall be borne in equal parts, by the Confederacy and Cantons. Art. 3. The federal council determines the succession and extent of the sur vey annually to be executed, and is generally charged with the execution of this law. The following is taken from the law of December 20, 1878, regarding the completion and security of triangulation in the Swiss forest domain : Article I. The federal council charges the Staff Bureau with the completion and protection of the triangulation of the first, second, and third orders in the Swiss forests. Art. II. For this work the amount of 15,000 francs (approximately $3,000) is annually appropriated. Art. III. The Cantons furnish the timber for, and cost of erection of, sig nals upon requisition ofthe federal engineers. Article V. The Cantons are held responsible for the care and protection of these triangulation stations. CIVIL DIVISIONS. Switzerland is divided into 22 cantons, 3 of them being subdivided into half cantons. The cantons are divided into communes. MILITARY DIVISIONS. Switzerland is divided into 8 territorial military divisions, wliich are subdivided into 32 regimental districts, and these again into battalion dis tricts, of which there are 96. There is another division into recruiting circles, which correspond either with regimental districts or with from 1 to 3 battalion districts. There are 75 recruiting circles. Switzerland adopted the French metric system of measures January 1, 1873, which has been in full legal force since January 1, 1877. The personnel ofthe topographic division in 1875 was as follows: 1. The engineers. 2. The topographers and draughtsmen of the office. 1366 WH 20"], [314, "306 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 3. The engravers on copper and the lithographers. 4. The printers. The engineers* comprise \u2014 (\u00ab) One verification engineer. (b) One triangulation engineer. (c) A number of engineers for the revision; and (d) A number of engineers for new surveys. The office topographers and draughtsmen (regularly appointed) com- prise \u2014 One topographer as draughtsman. One topographer as engineer. A number of contract topographers and draughtsmen, who are paid from the survey and publication fund as well as from cantonal contributions. Generally the engineers executing new surveys are paid by the square stundef of work done, and by special agreement. The other engineers receive either yearly salaries or are paid by the day. Scale. \u2014 The topographic survey of the territory comprising the Alps is made at a scale of 1:50,000, and that of the country outside of the high mountain regions at 1:25,000. These same scales are adhered to in tho publication of the atlas. On the index map (Uebersicht der Blatter) the extent of the surveys, made at scales of 1 : 25,000 and 1 : 50,000, are indicated respectively by small and large rectangles. The sheets of the topographic atlas (1 : 25,000 and 1 : 50,000) are adjusted to the sheets of the topographical atlas (Dufour atlas), as follows : One sheet of the latter (1 : 100,000) is equal to 16 sheets of the 1 : 50,000 and 64 sheets of the 1 : 25,000 atlas sheets ofthe new publication. Each sheet of the Dufour map is composed of 16 survey sections. In the new publication one section, scale 1:50,000, forms a sheet of like shape and dimensions, whereas at a scale of 1 : 25,000 the sections are divided into 4 subsections, each one forming one sheet. By this arrangement, uniformity in shape and size of the sheets at 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 25,000 is obtained, viz : 0m.35 by 0m24, corresponding to an area of 17,500 meters from west to east and 12,000 meters from south * Not regularly and permanently appointed, the number depending on the means at disposal. Ono square stunde is equal to 8.896 square miles."], [315, "307 SWITZERLAND\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. to north at a scale of 1 : 50,000, and 8,750 meters from west to east and 6,000 meters from south to north at a scale of 1 : 25,000. The numeration of the sheets is twofold. On the left hand of the upper margin of the new map the sections and subsections of the Dufour map corresponding to the sheet are indicated. Each sheet receives a number wliich is placed to the right on the upper margin, and these consecutive numbers correspond again with the sheets and sections of the Dufour map. In the rectangle on the right hand of the upper margin the number of the connecting sheets, according to their respective positions, are given. Finally each sheet receives as a heading the name of the most important place it contains. Surveys. \u2014 The primary and secondary triangulation net, covering all of Switzerland and connected with those of the adjacent countries, fur nishes the base for the tertiary triangulation of the several Cantons, from which again the detailed topographic measurements proceed. The instruments used in the surveys are : at 1 : 25,000, the common plane-table and Alidade, with a vertical circle, orienting compass and stadia. For measurements (1 : 50,000) in the high mountain regions, a small plane-table is used and as a rule no stadia. Since the beginning of the topographic surveys, in 1837, the method of equidistant level curves has been exclusively adopted for the representa tion of the relief of the terrestrial formations. The vertical distance between the level curves is 30m for the scale of 1:50,000, and 10m for that at 1:25,000, and in a few exceptions 8m and 4m, respectively. The meter measure was adopted from the beginning, and all heights refer to sea level. Drawing. \u2014 The sheets of the topographic atlas are almost an exact copy of the original surveys. The lettering, the figures denoting the heights (bench-marks), roads, towns, and isolated buildings, border-lines, forests, and rocky prominences are printed in black; the horizontal curves in bronze, and the water in blue colors. The small slopes and passes, nar row cuts and defiles, the forms of which cannot very well be indicated by curves of the adopted equidistances, are delineated by brown hachures."], [316, "308 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Rocky surfaces, bare of earth and vegetation, are represented by black hori zontal curves; that is, as far as the degree of inclination of such surfaces permits. Masses of rock and precipices, which on account of their steep ness cannot be delineated by curves at equidistances as used in this map, are drawn by black hachures, and in such a manner that the outline of the rocky formations, which have been previously determined by measure ments, is expressed pictorially by the aid of oblique illumination. In the general representation of the topography every tenth curve is a dotted line, and the height is indicated by figures in brown; dotted curves are also used to mark the beginning and end of slopes, and' as interspace curves, to express easy surface undulations. The black figures give the height in meters of the points whereon they are marked, above sea level. Net of co-ordinates. \u2014 The points of the geographical longitude and lat itude degree net are computed according to Flamsteed's modified projection. The longitude and latitude degrees, the former reckoned from the meridian of Paris, are indicated from 10 to 10 seconds on the margin of the sheets (1 : 25,000) and from 30 to 30 seconds on the sheets ( 1 : 50,000). The sheets are also divided into sections by rectangular co-ordinates, referring to the meridian of the observatory at Berne; the rectangular sections are 6 by 6 centimeters, each side corresponding to a length of l,500m on the larger and 3,000m on the smaller scale. Print. \u2014 The sheets (1:25,000) are copper engraved, and those of the high mountain districts (1:50,000) are lithographed. The well-known, complete, and artistic chart of Switzerland, commenced in 1830 by General Dufour (the first sheet published in 1842), and finished in 1864, is on the scale of 1:100,000, in 25 sheets. This map is still revised from time to time, and the plane-table sheets then executed are the basis of the present detailed map. The materials available for the new map were either the field topographic sheets made under General Dufour or by the Can tons subsequent to 1837. Where these were of the scale of 1:100,000, and without level curves, an entire reworking became necessary, and all the old sheets are revised and corrected. The price fixed in 1873 was from 700 to 800 francs per square stunde on the 1:25,000 scale, depending"], [317, "SWITZERLAND\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 309 on the character of the field work, and about one-half of the above of the 1:50,000 scale. The co-ordinates ofthe trigonometric points are furnished the engineers, who add the topography. The engraving and printing is done partly in the office, but principally by contract with private parties. For instructions for the topographical work at the scales of 1:50,000 and 1:25,000, also for the revision of the survey sheets, see Comstock: \"Notes on European Surveys.\" Of the 561 sheets of the topographical atlas there had been issued to July 1, 1885,95 sheets, scale 1:50,000, and 355, scale 1:25,000, or 450 in all. Independent of this special topographic series, there are also being issued at the Federal Topographic Bureau a General Topographic Map of Switzerland, scale 1:250,000, in 4 sheets, and the famous Dufour Atlas (being, on account of the high merit of field work and artistic representa tion, especially of the Alps, a model), comprising 25 sheets, scale 1 : 100,000.* The detailed topographic sheets, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000, serve as a basis for the geological chart of Switzerland. Experiments in methods of reproduction have been made for special maps. Cadastral surveys have been undertaken by several of the cantons, at 1:200, 1:500, and various other scales, as follows; Berne, 1845, 1867, 1874; Fribourg, 1841; Solotheurn, 1823, 1857, 1864; Schaffhausen, 1846 ; Waadt, 1804, 1812, 1841, 1863, 1883; Neuenburg, 1864; Geneva, 1711, 1778, 1841. SWITZERLAND. Geologic. The geological examination of Switzerland is conducted under a Com mission of the Helvetic Natural History Society, over which Prof. B. Studer, at the age of ninety, presides.f This work is carried on without an office furnished by the Government, or a paid secretary, the president even being charged with the correspondence. The Commission consists of 5 members selected by the Society, which number may be increased. In a printed statement, submitted by Professor * In addition to the miscellaneous maps given on page 128, may he noted an oro-hydrographic map of Switzerland, scale 1 : 500,000, lithographed, 7 colors, with curves at 100m interval, in hrown shading. t Professor Studer resigned this year, 1885, at the age of ninety -two. His successor has not yet been appointed."], [318, "310 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Studer at the Venice Congress, he remarks that \"the geological study of a country is only possible upon the condition that one possesses good topo graphic maps of it.\" The Commission is accountable to the Government for moneys received, reporting annual progress to the Society. The basis of the Geological Map is the Dufour Topographic Map of Switzerland (scale 1:100,000, 25 sheets). The collection of the data is intrusted to geologists, selected by the Commission, who are furnished with field maps on an increased scale, existing publications, &c. The Commission is also authorized to pur chase, pay for, accept and publish results of private examination, if deemed appropriate, and is charged with the publication of the Geological Maps, profiles, explanatory text, fossil illustrations, &c, and to make them known in scientific circles. The maps available for field use are of scales from 1:100,000 to 1 to 25,000, a topographic base for Alpine work being sometimes still wanting. The Helvetic Society essayed the investigations necessary for a map of Switzerland in 1828, but were hindered by want of funds, whereas, com mencing in 1830, Colonel (afterwards General) Dufour . commenced the Topographical Survey of Switzerland, finishing the work and publishing the results in 34 years. The appropriation' for the geological examination pays for but little more than the cost of publications, and for traveling expenses of the geol ogists, and even till now the studies and travels of the geologists were participated in by volunteers, who pay their own expenses. The result has been a number of good maps of the Jura Region, but in the Alps the want of good topographic preliminary maps had opposed almost insurmount able difficulties in fixing the limits of formations, until the excellent maps of Dufour were produced. In 1859 the Federal Government offered to the Society an annual grant of francs 3,000 ($600), to be employed in useful re searches, with which it was proposed to publish a General Geological Map based upon the atlas of Dufour. This proposition was agreed to by the So ciety and by the Federal Council, and the Commission above mentioned organized. This sum did not permit of a complete organization, and volunteer geologists (for whose professional work the Commission is not responsible) have of necessity been employed."], [319, "311 SWITZERLAND\u2014 GEOLOGIC. Even in the modest limits practiced the sum granted has been found insufficient, often being exhausted by the publications of a single sheet. According as new publications have appeared, the grant has been aug mented until it now reaches five times the original sum. It has been im possible to follow a logical order in publications, since the limited funds and conveniences of observers directed them to the Jura and lower levels, while the Alps required more time and effort. The results thus obtained by a number of independent observers, it appears, are to be reviewed and har monized, in which some districts consume more time than others. The publications are 20 volumes, quarto, of text and plates and maps issued between 1862 and 1880. Of 25 topographic sheets of Dufour's Atlas, 19 geologically colored, have appeared, and the three most difficult sheets, numbered XIII, XIV, and XVIII, comprehending the Central Alps, will be issued at the beginning of 1886. Then the three last sheets are occupied by the titles, and very large parts of Savoy and Lombardy. The resulting works prepared partly by amateurs, as well as experienced geologists, require revision and unifi cation, while in the Alps more detailed examinations are yet required, which it is understood will be taken up as fast as the present detailed to pographic maps of the War Service become available.* HOLLAND. Topographic. Since the completion in 1864 of the General Topographic Map of Holland (scale 1:50,000 \u2014 62 sheets) the War Department of Holland has been engaged in the production of a map (scale 1:25,000 \u2014 776 sheets) by utilizing the old field minutes (taken at a scale of 1 : 25,000 since 1854), and by a new detailed reconnaissance where necessary. This map is produced by chromolithography (process Eckstein), and kept solely for the confi dential use of the war branch of the Government. The area of Holland is 555 square German miles, or 13,740 square statute miles, with 4,323,647 population in 1880, or an average of 315 per square mile. * The maps and profiles are engraved and printed in chromolithography by J. Wurster, of Zurich and Winterthun, the publisher of the two editions of the \" Geological map of the World,\" in 8 sheets, by Jules Marcou."], [320, "312 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The length of the coast line from the Helder to Flushing is given at 250 kilometers, and that ofthe coast of Friesland and Groningen at 1 25 kilom eters. There are 8 ports on the North Sea, Rotterdam the most impor tant, and 8 on the Zuyder Zee, Amsterdam being the largest. There are 5 outlying islands of small size, the largest, Texel, being 25 kilometers long. The lakes are few in number and small. There are 10 principal streams, the length of the Rhine within Holland's territory being about 300 kilom eters (approximately 185 miles). CIVIL DIVISIONS. Holland is divided into 11 provinces, exclusive of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (a constitutional government, personally joined to the Kingdom of Holland.) MILITARY DIVISIONS. For military purposes, Holland is divided into three military districts (Afdulingen). The French metric system was adopted in Holland in 1821, and since 187-0 has been in use. Officers of the General Staff, under the Chief of that Bureau, conduct the topographic work in the field and prepare the results for publication. The Topographic Institute, with Mr. Eckstein as director, subject to the control of the Chief of the General Staff, is charged with the reproduction of all the military maps of the country as well as those of the \" Waterstaat\" (1:50,000), Public Works Department, and those of the rivers (1:10,000), the Marine and Geological Maps, and the Topographical Charts of the Dutch East Indian possessions. The process of obtaining an almost endless number of shades of color in 3 to 5 impressions by the combination of 3 basic colors, has been invented by the director, Mr. Eckstein, and will be again mentioned under the head of reproduction processes. The works of survey now actually being carried out in Holland are : 1. Fresh reconnaissances and measurements of height for the new detailed chart, scale 1:25,000, by the General Staff. 2. Collections of new field data for the \"Waterstaat\" chart, scale 1:50,000, and for the chart ofthe rivers, scale 1:10,000, by the Civil Engi neers of the Department of the \"Waterstaat,\" Commerce, and Industry."], [321, "HOLLAND\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 313 3. The revision of the marine charts by the Hydrographic Office. The geological maps, based on the topographic map (scale of 1 : 50,000 reduced to 1:200,000), have been completed and issued. The work of gathering the new data for the special topographic chart (1:25,000) was begun in 1862-63 and should be concluded about 1892-93 (30 years), at a total expense for field and office of 500,000 florins (approximately $250,000), or at an average cost of about $23.75 per square statute mile. The above expense is in addition to the cost of the original triangulation and topographic work for the scale of 1 : 50,000, as well as also the amount paid for the special cadastral surveys (scales 1 : 2,000, 1:3,000, 1:4,000), the \"Waterstaat\" map, scale 1 : 50,000, that of the rivers (1 : 10,000), and the cost of the geological survey. It has not been practicable to obtain an average of cost for all grades of Govern ment surveys in any country of Europe, because apparently very little, if any, carefully prepared data covering the entire cost exists, and detailed surveys, begun in many instances 100 years ago, with wars intervening, changes of personnel and scales, with frequent alterations ; the progress of works of public improvements have made calls of varying proportions, and above all, there has been apparently no requirement that details of the expenses for the different grades or portions of the work should be kept. Enough has been learned, however, from official documents to show that the survey of a given area may vary from a sum as small as $1 to fully $7,000 per square mile, depending upon the nature of the ground, its mode of occupation, and the scale and detail of the work.* The present annual cost of the reconnaissance of the new special map (which work is done by 5 or 6 army officers) is 4,000 florins (approximately $2,000), besides salaries and other expenses. This sum comes from the expenses for the Topographical Institute, which has annually between 50,000 and 60,000 florins for its support. It has been estimated that the cost of the detailed topographic revis ion work is about $16.50 per square mile. * To arrive at the true or actual cost of producing finally a complete detailed topographic map of a given scale of a given area, there must be added to the field and office cost of the current survey the prior cost of all surveys made for a like purpose within the same area. All the accurate mathe matical or measurement parts of the survey, at least, live and are perpetuated indefinitely."], [322, "314 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The Topographical Institute reproduces all maps for the War Depart ment, also the \"Waterstaat\" and river charts, the marine charts, and also those of the East Indian possessions, and occasionally certain cadastral sheets, which as a rule are produced, however, only as manuscript originals and traced copies. Description of Maps. Scale 1 : 50,000. \u2014 This map, constructed after Flamsteed's modified pro jection, consists of 62 sheets (graduated into 30 second divisions, sexagesi mals), one title sheet, one of conventional signs, and index and triangula tion sheets. Each sheet is 0m.8 by 0m.5, and numbered from east to west and from north to south. They were drawn by officers of the (Etat- Major) General Staff, lithographed at the Topographical Institute of the War Department, the first sheet having appeared in 1850 and the last in 1864. This map was begun about the year 1830; the field minutes were drawn to the scale of 1 : 25,000. The cadastral surveys of the communes, reduced to the above scale, were taken advantage of on the ground as the field work proceeded, the whole being based on a connected principal and secondary triangulation. The triangulations were first made by the use of the \"Borda\" repeating circle and an English sextant, a special theodolite replacing the former instrument. The average area covered by a topog rapher, for this class of field minutes, was, for a season, of five to six months, on plain ground, 140 sq. miles (25 sq. miles approximately per month), and for broken ground 96 square miles (17.5 square miles approximately per month). For the topographic relief a modification of the Lehmann system was adopted, on account of the very gentle slopes. A level compass served to obtain the angles of elevation to the highest points; the levels of the engineers of the \" Waterstaat\" were used as well as barometric observations. The plane of comparison passed through a point on the large sluice of the Amsterdam Canal, the zero being nearly the mean height of sea level at this place. Absolute heights above the plane of comparison are expressed in meters. In the plains (\"polders\") the mean height of the summer low water above and below this plane is indicated. The boundaries of the state"], [323, "315 HOLLAND\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. and provinces alone are shown. The names of the cities, villages, hamlets, chateaux, canals, &c, are expressed in Roman characters, other objects of less importance in italics. The river charts, 1 : 10,000, as well as the hydrographic maps, were consulted and compared, while for the areas outside the limit of the state, needed to complete the full atlas sheets, the best existing maps were taken, as, for instance, for Prussia the Etat-Major map (scale 1 : 80,000) and for Belgium the military map (scale 1 : 20,000). The principal meridian passes through the west tower (\"Westerto ren\") of the West church of Amsterdam. The parallel of latitude 51\u00b0 30' N. was adopted as the mean, many computations having been based upon it instead of the parallel of 52\u00b0 10' N, more nearly the actual middle par allel, dividing the territory equally. The origin of co-ordinates is the in tersection of the above meridian and parallel. Each sheet is known by its number, and the name of the principal place within it. Along the middle of the border, the names of the adjacent sheets are indicated. A small in dex of 9 rectangles is found in the upper left-hand corner, showing the position of the eight surrounding sheets. There is stated below the lower border of the later sheets the year of field work and of the engraving. Two scales are given, one for 10,000 meters and another for 10 meters. The map has been found to be of great and increasing use, in construction of railroads, canals, roads, and all other public works of every extent, car ried on by the Government or as a private industry. The index chart is a reduction of the 62 topographic sheets, and is finely executed. Scale 1 : 25,000. \u2014 This map is produced by chromolithography (pro cess Eckstein) in the colors of black, blue, red, green, and pink of varying tints. No latitudes or longitudes are shown; the area of each of the 776 sheets is about 20 square miles; the area of the sheet covered by topography, comprising Schiedam as its principal locality, is 15f inches by 9| inches, and is without curves. This is the new detailed topographic map of Holland, held alone for the use of the Government through its War Department. It is considered a confidential publication, although copies were displayed for the first time"], [324, "316 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. at Venice. The planimetry is in black; rivers, canals, and waters in blue ; settlements and lines of communication in red, cultivated parts in various shades of green, every foot-path even, and all objects of any importance either natural or artificial are represented. The sheets are known by name and number, and follow a special system of conventional signs. They are excellently produced, extremely clear and agreeable to the eye, and the best specimens of map chromolithography yet seen by me. \"Waterstaat\" Map, scale 1:50,000. \u2014 This map, upon which the areas of the several \" polders\" are shown in colors, is based upon the General Topographic Map, scale 1:50,000. Four \"polder\" sheets, or Waterstaat charts, constitute one of the regular topographic sheets, scale 1 : 50,000. Polders discharging their waters into the same gulf are shown by the same tint; those surrounded by a small stripe of a darker tint do not discharge their waters direct into a gulf or basin except through another polder, while those conjoining have the same color and gulfs, and flooded lands are uncolored. The areas of polders are expressed in hectares and printed in red figures within the polder, the heights being given in meters above or below Amster dam gauge. The dikes surrounding the polder, that serve also as a means of communication, either as roads or paths, are denoted in red. The sea and river dikes that require special protection have a separate conventional sign. The discharge sluices are given in red, and the water, wind, or steam mills for discharging polders are specially shown. The low-water line is given in blue, as also the land that is dry at that stage. Each sheet has printed upon its border a detailed description of the hydrographic pecu liarities of the area delineated thereon. Map of Principal Rivers, 1 : 10,000. \u2014 After the great floods in 1822, a commission was formed to determine the best means of controling the waters in time of flood, winter and summer, which led, upon the recom mendation of this commission, to a Royal decree in 1829, ordering a com plete hydrographic description of all the rivers traversing the territory exposed to inundation, and the formation of a collection of special maps of the principal rivers of the Kingdom. Special geodetic and topographic"], [325, "317 HOLLAND\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. operations were earned on, in order that there should be the fullest confi dence in the exactness of the results. This work was commenced in 1829, and terminated in 1864, by the engineers ofthe \"Waterstaat,\" and there resulted six series of maps which are described in an official report issued in 1855, followed by a supple ment in 1860. The projection is the Flamsteed modified, the borders of the sheet being parallels and perpendiculars to the meridian, passing through the clock of the West church (\" Westerkerk\") of Amsterdam. The origin of co-ordinates is the intersection of the above meridian by the parallel of 51\u00b0 30' N. The field survey has been made at the scale of 1:5,000 and the engraved map (in black) at that of 1:10,000. The main triangulation of the war service was taken as a base to which was added a secondary and tertiary triangulation, with special topographic and hydro graphic observations, along the course of each stream. Use was also made of the field notes of the cadastral survey. The meander route along the valley of each stream (\" thalweg\"), indicated by a dotted line, gives the mean depth of water in decimeters, referred to the level of mean summer routes at each point. The form of the bed of the rivers has been determined by means of cross-sections, one kilometer apart, numbered from the direction ofthe stream downward, shown by a dotted line and Roman figures. The point at which each of the cross-sections is made, is connected with a network of special cords, to which the levels within which the perimeters of the overflowed areas are referred, and connection is made also with a special register of soundings referred to mean low water in summer, made simultaneously with the cross-section. The register also contains the description of all ar tificial objects, as revetments, levees, dikes, sluices, bridges, &c. These registers are later on supplemented by a collection of hydrographic data, disseminated here and there in manuscript form. These charts have pro ven of great benefit, and are specially a necessity in a country, the pros perity of wliich depends so much upon an active and incessant supervision and control of the principal water-courses traversing its territory.

The above gives the number issued in 1865 (see Repertoire de Cartes, huitieme livraison, pp. 59-63). The Cadastral Survey originally completed at the scale before men tioned and now undergoing simple revision and repartition, is executed under the Finance Department, but the sheets (the total number of which was not learned) are not usually reproduced except in such small numbers as are actually required by the Government. Elaborate and carefully ex ecuted legends of conventional signs for the maps, both in black and colors, are prepared and printed at the Topographical Institute, as well as studies in the art of topographical representation, with specimens at various scales from 1 : 5,000 to 1 : 50,000. The Topographical Institute, \"Waterstaat\" organization and Hydro graphic Survey are considered permanent works. They are established by Royal decree and cannot be changed by legislative act. In the topographic office about half of the employe's are permanent, the balance temporary. No reports of current observations are published, an annual report in man uscript only being submitted to the War Minister, through the Chief of the General Staff. The only publication of the Topographical Institute, other than maps, so far as known, is a volume entitled (\"Meet Kunstige beschry ving van het Koningryk der Neederlanden,\") Geometrical Account of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, relating to General Triangulation of the King dom, upon which all the maps are based."], [327, "HOLLAND\u2014 GEOLOGIC. 319 HOLLAND. Geologic. A geological map of Holland (scale 1 : 200,000 \u2014 28 sheets), based on the military map (scale 1 : 50,000 \u2014 62 sheets), reduced, has been prepared and published, and the labors connected with it closed. The publication of this map is due to the efforts of a commission appointed in 1852 for the investi gation, and principally to the late Dr. W. C. H. Staring, who carried the work to completion, after the dissolution of the commission. The borders of the sheets (each of which embraces four times the area of a full topographical sheet, scale 1 : 50,000) are divided to 5' in arc, both latitudinally and longitudinally, and are of the size 0m.4 by 0m.25, being numbered from west to east and north to south. These maps were prepared and published at the Topographical Bureau of the War Department at The Hague, by Messrs. Weelden and Mingelen, at the rate of 1 florin per sheet.

The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is situated between north latitude 49\u00b0 35' and 50\u00b0 16' and longitude 23\u00b0 20' and 24\u00b0 05' east of meridian of Isle of Ferro. Its area is 2,587 square kilometers, approximately 724 square miles ; population, 209,570 in 1880, or an average of 275 inhabitants per square mile. From the geological point of view, it is composed of two parts of an entirely different nature, the (Oesling) Ardennes and the \"Gutland\" (good land). The Society of Natural Sciences of the Grand Duchy, founded in 1850, imposed upon itself as a principal task the study of the natural history of the country from a purely scientific standpoint, assuming that the solution of this problem depends in a great measure upon the compilation of a detailed geological map of the country. The initiative was mainly due to His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Holland. A commission of 9 persons (geologists and engineers) was named for this purpose. It was decided at first to prepare the field minutes of each commune separately on the scale of 1:10,000, or at smallest 1:20,000, and leaving the fixing of the scale for the final map to a later date. The divis ion into formations at this time laid down provisionally was adhered to, and appears in the second volume of the publications of the Society of Natural Sciences (1854, p. 192). The alluvium and other Quaternary deposits were not at first delineated for fear of losing clearness and scien tific merit. The field work commenced in the autumn of 1855. Four maps were definitely colored at the end of the first year. Only little progress was made during the autumn of 1856, there being but two observers. At the end of 1862 the maps of 25 communes had been completed and 9 others begun. In 1862 Professor Wies remained as the only active member. He continued to work during seasons of 1862-'63 in the valley ofthe Moselle.

To this were added details acquired in the vicinity of mining districts, and the work was accelerated by abandoning the plan of limiting areas of investigation to communes, making it in a direct line to cover the remainder of the country. The Ardennes were examined during 1864, and the work pushed with great activity in 1865. The field work was completed in 1869, and revisions consumed the three following years. The maps were finally ready for publication in 1874, and upon the request of the Government the \"Chamber\" granted for this purpose the sum of 10,000 francs (approximately $2,000), the balance being made up by sub scription. The publication was engraved by Erhard, of Paris, and printed at the establishment of Lemercier. As far as possible a single color has been employed for a single formation, the subdivisions being indicated by different shades. For each division, as near as may be, the choice of the color has been made approaching the tint of the ground represented. The diluvium of the Quaternary formations have been indicated by hachures alone. The chart is issued in 8 sheets (scale 1:40,000), with a title and explan atory page, so that it can be mounted as a wall map. The interior size is 22 by 2Q\\ inches (without latitude or longitude lines or border divisions), and printed on paper 25 by 31 inches, in 25 shades of color.

A photolithographic copy (in black) ofthe field minutes (scale 1 : 20,000) of one of these residences (Passeroean) was also exhibited at Venice. Apparently a preliminary or first edition of such maps as may be required are published at Batavia. The map of Java, in 5 impressions, shows 20 different tints, obtained by the combination of 3 primitive colors \u2014 blue, yellow, and red. The let tering is by typography (see Plate No. 10). Fourteen residences have been published, 3 are in course of execution, and 8 have not yet been commenced.

The Geographical Institute also publishes a general map of Spain (1:500,000), showing division of ter ritory for assigning to the reserves and depots of the army the respective zones which furnish their contingents. The area of the Kingdom of Spain is approximately 193,286 square miles and the actual population in 1877 is stated at 16,625,860, thus giving an average of 86 to the square mile. There are two cities exceeding 200,000 inhabitants, three with more than 100,000, four above 70,000, five larger than 50,000, four exceeding 35,000, and seven greater than 30,000 people.

That the observations in the fundamental series should be continued prefera bly, following strictly the method which conduces to the compensation of errors by the formulas of Bessel and Baeyer, according to special instructions. 2. That iu addition to the central base, already measured, three others should be selected and measured, one of which should be situated, as already projected, iu the most southern part of the Peninsula, and the other two as far north as possible, and near the eastern aud western coasts. 3. That the astronomical observatory of Madrid, concurrently with the Geograph ical Institute, and with due regard to the position of this scientific establishmeut, should commence the determination of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths at vertices of the fundamental series conveniently chosen. 4. That iu the special leveling of precision the system agreed upon iu the confer ences of the International Geodetic Association for the measurement of degrees in Europe should be adopted, aud that this new work should be begun immediately. 5. That considering the fundamental series as a single system, the general com pensation of errors should be commenced, solving the second group of equations which arise from the observations at each station considered independently. 6. That the triangulations of the first order in the interior of the quadrilaterals, and those of the second and third orders, should be commenced in each district ac cording as they may be needed to support other trigonometrical net- works. To secure the surest execution of this plan and a convenient uniformity in all the work, the fol lowing measures were adopted: Four commissions, composed of chiefs and officers of the corps of artillery, engineers, and general staff, who are detailed to the section of geodetic works of the Geographical Institute, were charged with compiling projects of instructions; the first commission for the observation of angles in the geodetic tri angulations of the first order, the second for the execution of the first computations which are to be made in the same triangulations, with all the necessary models, the third for the assistants charged with the construction of the signals of the first order, and the last for the service of the heliotrope sections. These projects of instructions being presented, they were approved and printed immediately. Another commission, similarly formed, proposed the forms of computation to solve the equations and substitute the values of the unknown quantities, after tljey were determined, in the work which had been commenced for the general compensa tion; and these, having been approved, were also printed.

The distribution for field topographic work is first by provinces, subsequently by regions and communes. The scale is fixed at 1 : 50,000, each sheet embracing 20' in longitude, by 10' in latitude, the surface being considered as a plane. For example, the sheet which contains Madrid is bounded by parallels of 40\u00b0 20' and 40\u00b0 30' N. latitude and the meridians of 0\u00b0 10' E. and 0\u00b0 10' W. longi 1ude from the astronomical observatory, constituting an area for this as for all other sheets in the form of a trapezium. The value of the arcs of meridian and latitude corresponding to each belt of sheets is specially calculated. The belts commence at 36\u00b0 N. lat itude and end at 43\u00b0 40' N. latitude, while the greatest difference of the northern and southern lines of the trapezium for any sheet is 0m.06, and for the eastern and western, that of 0m.00048. The map is engraved on stone in 5 colors \u2014 black for arable ground and lettering; blue for water- courses, &c. ; red for buildings, constructions, and ordinary routes ; green for forests, horticultural tracts, and grazing lands ; and sienna for the level curves at equidistances of 20 meters, with intermediate altitudes of 10 meters interval. Prior to the establishment of this map, the atlas of Colonel Coello, of the Engineers, was the standard publication for Spain, which atlas is now possessed by the Government. The errors, admissible for triangulation of the first order, are the limits adopted for each class of operations by the International Geodetic Commis sion ; however, in the actual operations the probable error has been kept smaller than this limit, and the description of the base-measuring, geodetic, and leveling operations, with results given in the volumes already published by the Institute, show a rigid accuracy, comprehensiveness, and utility, which places the triangulation of Spain in the front rank. Instruments of the highest order of precision are employed for the astronomic, geodetic, and topographic work; among them are construc tions by Brunner Fre'res, of Paris. The annual cost defrayed from appropriations made in accordance with the General Budget is for the personnel 1,379,438 francs, or approximately $275,875, and for material, comprising the statistical service and that of"], [336, "328 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. weights and measures, the sum of 993,475 francs, or approximately $198,695. Total, $474,950 approximately. The observations for the principal triangulation commenced in 1855, and are at present nearly terminated, as well as the computations, except for compensation of errors. The date of completion is not known, while 29 sheets of the atlas had been issued in September 1885. The publications other than maps consists of \"Memoirs,\" referred to in list of publications, special publications bearing on base measurements and levelings, as well as volumes of instructions for \"Geodetic\" and \"Topo graphic\" work, making in all 19 volumes and 7 pamphlets, exhibited at Venice. The officers of this Institute* have participated in the measurement of the large arc of the meridian from Shetland Islands to Laghout, and have co-operated with the French in joining the geodetic net of Spain with that of Algeria. Established among the later European institutions of this char acter, it is enabled to profit by the experience already acquired in the use of the most perfect instruments, and the adoption of new methods, to the end that full advantage of all known scientific appliances may be taken, with the fixed object of producing a detailed topographic map of the highest order of excellence. The relative precision with which bases have been measured maybe seen at a glance by reference to page 162 of descrip tion of new base-measuring apparatus (\" Nuevo apparatode medir Bases Geodesicas\"), by General Ibanez, where errors are given varying from 1:200,000 to 1:5,800,000 of the total length. It is to these publications, especially the \" Memoirs,\" that reference should be had for a correct understanding of the magnitude and precision of this work. The Cadastral Survey of Spain has not yet been organized, while from the same Ministry there are special commissions for the study ofthe Geology, Botany, and Hydrology of the Peninsula, with works well advanced, but not as yet published.

The first geological map of Spain is the \"Geognostische Uebersichts karte von Spanien,\" by J. Ezquerra del Bayo, published in Stuttgart, in 1850 ; of which a revised edition appeared in 1858, at Moscow (Russia). It is a very small map without scale. In 1864, de Verneuil and Collomb published, in Paris, a larger geological map of the whole Iberian peninsula, under the title of \"Carte Ge'ologique de l'Espagne et du Portugal,\" one sheet, scale 1:1,500,000. A second edition, revised and improved, with a small explanatory summary, was issued in 1868. Another general map was published in 1879 by Don Federico de Bo tella y de Hornos, Mining Engineer, and a member of the geological organ ization, under the title of \"Mapa Geologico de Espana y Portugal,\" Mad rid, scale 1 : 200,000, one sheet. This is a well executed map in chromo lithography, and may be considered as the official geological map. The Secretary of the Interior and Public Works (Ministro de Fomento), under wliich the Corps of Mines and the geological investigation are placed, has just issued (August, 1885) the first sheet of the complete geological map of Spain (scale 1:400,000) as it will finally appear. When finished it will comprise 16 sheets. CUBA AND PORTO KECO. Geologic. The \"Comision del Mapa Geologico de Espana\" has extended its exam inations to the Spanish West Indies.

Several memoirs and geological maps have already appeared in the \"Boletin de la Comision del Mapa Geologico de Espana;\" the last one, Tomo XI, No. 1, 1884, contains a geological map of the whole island of Cuba (scale 1:2,000,000), by de Castro and Salterain, 1869-1883. For Porto Rico, the examination is made by Angel Vasconi, Mining Engineer, and a geological map of the island will soon be issued. THE CANARIES AND PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. Geologic. The director, de Castro, has divided the geological examination into six great divisions or groups, and has placed the colonies in the sixth group (sexto grupo), after the 48 provinces of Spain.

Topographic The General Topographic Map of the entire Kingdom of Italy, on a scale of 1 : 100,000, in 277 sheets, has been in progress since 1862. The approximate area of Italy is 111,405 square statute miles, with a population in 1879 of 28,459,451, or an average of approximately 255 per square mile. The number of large cities aggregating 2,130,595 inhabitants is 16 ; 8 of them with a population of more than 100,000 each, 5 with from 60,000 to 100,000, and 3 from 40,000 to 60,000. There are 155 rivers and streams directly discharging into the sea, having an average width at mouth of 90 meters, and a length of 74 kilometers, with an average discharge of"], [340, "332 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 788 cubic meters _= 2, 783 cubic feet per second, but none being large enough to admit of steam navigation The surfaces of Lakes Garda, Iseo, Como, Lugano, and Maggiore, aggre gate 824 square kilometers. There are other lakes, but none of them are utilized for steam navigation. CIVIL DIVISIONS. For administrative purposes Italy is divided into 69 provinces, which are subdivided into communes. MILITARY DIVISIONS. For military purposes Italy is divided into 10 army corps commands, which are subdivided into 20 divisional commands. These comprise 88 military districts (distretto militare) each of which consists of from 1 to 5 political districts (bezirk, mundamenti.) Italy has adopted the metric measurement system. The work of the General Topographic Survey is carried on under the War Department by the Military Topographical Institute (Istitutb Topo graphico Militare),* a branch of the General Staff of the Army, but with power of independent action and self-control, located at Florence, with a major-general at its head. The Institute was constituted in pursuance of Royal decree of October 27, 1872, and entered upon its functions January 1, 1873, being one among the youngest of any, at the same time possessed of much vitality, having profited by the experience of older similar establishments. The duties of this Institute embrace the following objects : [Translation from official pamphlet in Italian.] I. The execution of all geodetic and topographic works necessary to obtain the data for the construction of the topographic and corographic maps of Italy, and those for military and other public services. II. The custody of geodetic documents and of the original maps, keeping the latter constantly revised. III. To cultivate the studies of geodesy, topography, and drawing for the pur pose of creating a skilled personnel of officers of Geographical and Topographical Engineers, to perfect the chemico-mechanical process of reproduction of maps with the greatest swiftness, clearness, and precision. * Designation now changed to Military Geographical Institute (Istituto Geografico Militare)."], [341, "333 ITALY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. IV. To join in the works of higher geodesy inherent to the measurement of ter restrial arcs, assuming the part assigned to Italy by the International Commission for the European degree measurement. For effecting the objects named, the Institute employs a certain number of officers and technical employe's, and is organized as follows : A. The Office of Direction : (Secretaryship, foreign map archives, administration, and accounts.)* B. First Division : (Trigonometric reconnaissance, measuremeut of bases, level iugs of precision; triangulation, geodetic and astronomic publications relative to the results of the Institute as well as also to those of the degree-commission.) O. Second Division: (Topographic surveys, reconnaissances, and revision of maps.) D. Third Division : (Preparation of originals of the map, afterwards reproduced by means of various chemico-mechanical processes, copper- incision, lithography, and caleography.) E. Fourth Division: (Reproduction of all maps published by the Institute by photography, photolithography, photozincography, phototype, and photoincision.) The officers are selected from the (Etat-Major) General Staff, Military Engineers, Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry. A certain number of selected enlisted men are also employed. The principal business of the Institute has been that of completing the work already commenced by the Technical Bureau of Turin, the survey of Sicily begun in 1862 (scale 1:50,000), and of extending that survey also to the southern provinces, gradually perfect ing methods. These works having been pushed with great energy, there had been obtained prior to 1881 much material for the general map of all Italy (scale 1: 100,000 \u2014 277 sheets), and 56 sheets had been actually pub lished by General Avet's process of photoincision. At the same time there has been in process of preparation a corographic map of the entire King dom (scale 1:500,000 \u2014 24 sheets), of which 5 had been published, in addi tion to the publications on the scales of 1:50,000 and 1:25,000. To these labors are added, besides the triangulation charts and the astronomic-geo detic publications, the preparation of the maps of the environs of the prin cipal cities, of military circumscription, of railways and lines of navigation, and miscellaneous works, as noted in the Catalogue of the publications of the Institute. * Under the superior authority of the chief of the General Staff (a Lieutenant-General), the Director of the Institute has full and direct executive control of all its works."], [342, "334 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Upon the accession of the present Italian Government, the following general topographic maps were in existence of separate states, viz: 1. Map of provinces of the Kingdom of Sardinia (scale 1:50,000) in progress of publication, with reduction to scale 1:250,000. 2. Map of Island of Sardinia (scale 1:250,000). 3. Austrian maps of Veneto-Lombardy, Duchies of Parma and Modena and Cen- tral Italy (scale 1:86,400). 4. Inghirami's Map of Tuscany (scale 1:200,000). 5. Map of Kingdom of Naples, by Rizzi-Zauoni (scale 1:114,942). 6. Map of Island of Sicily (scale 1:200,000). These maps of different scales and methods of representation were found inadequate, and in 1861 the Government proceeded to the construc tion of a new map of the Neapolitan provinces and, the Island of Sicily. New trigonometric operations were begun, and, by association with the International Commission for degree measurement, a modulus as early as 1865 was given to the astronomic and geodetic features of a comprehen sive topographic work. (See notes on European Surveys, Comstock, pp. 54, 55, 56.) The survey of Sicily commenced in 1862 and was finished in 1868 (scale 1:50,000). The map was reproduced in 1871 by photozinc ography, in 48 sheets, on a scale of 1:100,000. The triangulation work of the present unified survey is constantly two years in advance of the topography. The very best German and Austrian triangulation and leveling instruments are used. The triangles are very nearly equilateral. The personnel consists principally of officers and en listed men of the general service, with the exception of certain technical officials, such as computers, engravers, &c. The field sheets (scale 1 : 50,000, as also those scale 1 : 25,000) from the hands of the topographer are reduced and drawn on the scale of 1 : 75,000 for the production of the final sheets, scale 1 : 100,000. The topographical and drawing divisions are both divided into 4 sec tions, based upon skill and proficiency, with increase of pay according to term of service. The officers receive commutation of rations while in the field, and have their traveling expenses paid. The field work is entirely done by means of the plane-table. A field party consists of a captain of the (Etat-Major) General Staff in charge, with from five to eight topographers (divided among lieutenants of infantry"], [343, "335 ITALY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. and general service men). Each topographer has two assistants, with stadia rods, by aid of which all horizontal measurements are made. The plane-table sheets, carefully prepared and mounted in advance, are inked in and practi cally finished in the field. All determined triangulation points are plotted and altitudes marked also in advance. These triangulation points as laid down on the sheet are first checked and the magnetic meridian is then laid down. A very complete instrument is used with the plane-table; the differences in elevation are computed at the station, the distances obtained by stadia measurements, and the contours drawn at 10 meters apart for the 1:50,000 scale. Field minutes in the Valley of the Po, vicinity of Florence, Rome, and Naples, are drawn to the scale of 1 : 25,000, and certain sea ports at the scale of 1:10,01)0. Several topographers may work upon a single sheet. A skilled topographer is expected to cover 50 to 60 kilometers square per month (scale 1:50,000) and 20 kilometers square per month on the scale of 1:25,000. Each hundredth meter curve is drawn heavy, and on the map (scale 1:100,000) the contours, 50 feet apart, alone are expressed. Very little engraving is done. Photography is applied to photogravure (heliogravure), photozincography, and photolithography. Finished sheets are sold to the trade at \u00a3 lire \u2014 10 cents. Each plane-table sheet (scale 1:25,000) represents about eight months work, and is overhauled, revised, and perfected at the Central Office at Florence. The finishing of the original field minutes is done both by technical civil assistants and officers. These finished field minutes are converted into finished originals by more skillful draughtsmen, the line work transferred, the lettering, hachuring, and curves added. Description of maps, scale 1 : 100,000. \u2014 Each sheet embraces 30' in longi tude and 20' in latitude, or an area (latitude 41\u00b0 40' to 42\u00b0) of approxi mately 625 square miles. The surface covered by topography at this latitude is 16 inches by 14.25 inches, printed in black, without tint, on paper 25.5 inches by 23.5 inches. The borders are divided into minutes and for each degree, and each 5 minutes of latitude and longitude is given in figures.

Elevations of prominent points in meters are given, but none are written on contours The initial meridian is the Observatory (Monte Mario) at Rome. The sheet is recognized by name and number. A scale of 10 kilometers is given. The reproduction is by the photoincision process of Colonel Avet, reduced from scale 1 : 75,000. Nine small rectangles in upper left-hand corner denote adjoining sheets. The names and number of the four adjoining sheets appear along the respective borders. (The sample sheet examined was No. 150,'issued 1880.) Scale 1 : 50,000. \u2014 This series is reproduced at once as the field minutes on the same scale are completed. The same index as that for the 1 : 100,000 map applies, four sheets of the former being equal to one of the latter. The area embraced is 15' in longitude by 10' in latitude, or approximately 156 square miles. The balance of the territory of Italy, excluding the plain of the Valley of the Po, the lower Valley of the Arno, the environs of large cities, parts of mining regions, and districts of special importance, for which field minutes are taken on a scale of 1:25,000, is reproduced upon the field notes or minutes to the scale of 1:50,000. In advance of the preparation and issue of the general topographic map of scale 1:100,000, the field min utes or preliminary sheets are rapidly issued by photogravure for army and general administrative purposes, and especially for the use of engineers. Top ographic reliefs are shown by curves, with broken hachures for steep summits, and printed in black without tint. The meridian of reference is that of the Observatory of Monte Mario at Rome. The elevations of prominent points are expressed in meters. The contours (unnumbered) are at equidistances of 10 meters. Degrees and minutes of latitude and longitude are stated at the 4 corners. The sheet is marked by name and number, and its position as one quarter of corresponding full sheet, scale of 1 : 100,000. Scale 1:25,000. \u2014 The field minutes of special portions of Italy (see description 1:50,000) are taken at the scale of 1:25,000, and rapidly re produced upon receiving revision as to accuracy, without regard to artistic effect, for immediate use. Each sheet embraces 7' 5\" in longitude by 5'"], [345, "337 ITALY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. in latitude, ot an area of approximately 39 square miles. The space cov ered by the topography (sheet 25.75 by 18.75 inches) is 15.5 by 14.25 inches at 44\u00b0 50' to 44\u00b0 55'. The border lines are divided to minutes, and each 5' in latitude and 7' in longitude stated in figures. Contours are drawn at equidistances of five meters, each fifth curve being drawn heavier. Repro duction is by photozincography in black without tint, ordinary topography following the system of conventional signs. The initial reference meridian is the same as for the above-described sheets. Each sheet is designated by name, number, and its relation to the series of scale 1:100,000. Scale given in kilometers (16 small rectangles, equivalent of 1 sheet of 1:100,000) in upper left-hand corner. These sheets are also issued in colors, with black as a basis, waters in blue, cultivation in buff, vineyards in a pinkish red, woods in green, and settlements in deep red. PROJECTION OF SHEETS. Scale 1 : 100,000. \u2014 On this scale meridians and parallels may be consid ered as right lines, within the limits of a single sheet, in consequence of which it is desirable to divide up the sheets (each 30' in longitude by 20' latitude) into 5' rectangles. It is sufficient to divide the upper and lower margins into six equal parts, and the lateral margins into four equal parts. The initial longitude is the meridian of the Villa Barberini Observatory on Monte Mario near Rome. This observatory was demolished when the for tifications of Rome were destroyed, but the exact location of the old trigo nometric center has been preserved and marked within the works. East longitude is considered positive, and western negative ; northern latitude positive, and southern negative, and the center of each sheet is taken as the origin of co-ordinates for every point contained in it. Scale 1:25,000. \u2014 The co-ordinates of the points contained in the four sheets surrounding the center are obtained the same as those of the sheets, 1 : 100,000. For the 12 other sheets the co-ordinates of the vertex nearest the center must be taken from the co-ordinates, scale 1 : 100,000. The map of the Sardinian States (scale 1 : 50,000) has as its center of development the Royal Observatory of Turin, whose latitude, according to 1366 WH 22"], [346, "338 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. the old astronomical determination, is 45\u00b0 04' 08\". 06, and longitude west of Monte Mario 4\u00b0 46' 02\".22. The same geographical co-ordinates, calculated geodetically from the meridian of Monte Mario, gives : Latitude 45\u00b0 04' 14\". 74, and longitude 4\u00b0 46' 02\".63 west. The Austrian map of the Lombardo- Venetian territory and of Central Italy, on the scale of 1:86,400, has for its origin of co-ordinates the cupola of the cathedral of Milan, whose latit ude was retained, 45\u00b0 27' 34\". 5. The origin of the longitude of this map is the meridian of the Island of Ferro, with respect to which the center was calculated to be 26\u00b0 51' 16\". 6. The difference of longitude between Monte Mario and Milan is 3\u00b0 15' 42\". 11. The map of the Southern Provinces, on the scale of 1:50,000, has for its central point the intersection of the meridian that passes through the Royal Observatory of Capo di Monte, with the parallel of 40\u00b0. The differ ence of longitude between Monte Mario and the Observatory of Capo di Monte is 1\u00b0 48' 13\".91. The map of the environs of Florence, on the scale of 1 : 25,000, has as its center of development the Observatory of San Giovannino, the latitude of which is calculated to be 43\u00b0 46' 26\".92. The difference of longitude' between Monte Mario and San Giovan nino in 1\u00b0 11' 50\". 36. The map of Sardinia of General Lamarmora, on the scale of 1 : 250,000, has for its center of development the intersection of the meridian that passes through Cagliari (tower of San Pancrazio) with the parallel of latitude 39\u00b0 13' 14\". 44. The longitude of this map is corrected from the meridian of Cagliari (tower of San Pancrazio). The difference of longitude between Cagliari and Monte Mario is 3\u00b0 20' 03\". 25. In ad dition to the systematic series of maps now being prepared and issued as above, on scales 1:100,000, 1:50,000, 1 : 25,000, the following, supple mented by special marine and cadastral maps, are among the most impor tant of those published and sold by the Military Topographical Institute at comparatively nominal rates. 1.

Photozincography has been well developed under Colonel Avet, and found to be most useful. The heliographic process has nearly passed its stage of probation. Here as elsewhere the advantage of securing imperishable originals,, cut upon zinc or copper, has great weight, since, for periods to come, the finished maps of the present century must answer the wants of the Government and public, particularly as engravings, hand or mechanical, on stone, will in time dete riorate, as well as paper originals, while the surface of zinc or copper admits more readily of the changes inherent to revision. The publications of the Institute, other than maps, consisted in 1881 of 45 volumes and pamphlets (quarto and royal octavo) on astronomic, geodetic, topographic, and other results of the survey. The work of completing a general topographic map on the scale of 1:100,000 from field minutes 1:50,000 and 1:25,000, taking advantage of the topographic data hitherto collected, was begun in 1862, and it is esti mated that it may be finished in 1892 (30 years), at a total cost of about 16,000,000 lire (or approximately $3,333,333) ; of which 8,000,000 lire are placed on the extraordinary or special budget, in addition to the regular or usual annual fund for the cost of tlie Institute proper as an office of the Gov ernment. An estimate, obtained by Lieutenant Birnie, U. S. Ordnance, while in Florence in 1880, was 25,000,000 lire as the outside limit of cost of the preparation and completion of the map (scale 1:100,000 \u2014 277 sheets) from field minutes of scales 1:25,000 and 1:50,000. The- average cost of this special work is 30 lire per square mile, all salaries and labor being less than in any country of Europe. Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the Italian Government for meeting the call for general as well as detailed maps of its entire territory in a spirit of"], [348, "340 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. equity, substantiating thereby the certainty of uniform results, and a con stant improvement in the \"esprit du corps\" of the personnel engaged, and bringing this section of the globe once more toward the front in the geo graphical undertakings of the world. The annual expense, independent of the military personnel, is 350,000 lire, which is increased by the cost ofthe latter to 393,019 lire.* An inde pendent calculation, based on yearly expenditures, by the office of accounts at Florence, gives 27 lire as the total cost of triangulation and topog raphy per square mile, an exceedingly modest sum, but it must be borne in mind that a large share of the topographic work required had been obtained by older surveys. It is expected that the triangulation will be completed by January 1, 1890. No other departments of the Government are per mitted to issue general topographical maps, while in turn the detailed maps of the Institute become directly available for the geological observers in the field, and for the representation of the formations in colors, &c. The accuracy of the main and other triangulation is of the first order, and follows the plan proposed and adopted by the International Degree Measurement Commission, the computations being made in accordant with the method of least squares. The field work of triangulation, topography, and leveling proceeds in pursuance of special printetl instructions for each branch, and is recorded upon blank forms specially prepared to meet the wants of the work in hand. The original archives rest witli this branch of the War Office, and are systematically arranged so as to be permanently available for future refer ence. * The Director, under date of September 2, 1885, states that the average cost for each sheet sca'e 1: 1(10,000 (625 square miles), is 5,000 fiancs, for the triangulation, and 12,000 francs for the topography, scale 1:50,000, and 36,000 francs for scale 1: '.'5,000; or an average of f 13. 12 per square mile, at 1:25,000, for field-\\vork> triangulation and topography. Ten sheets of the principal map are annually pro duced, and the above current sum covers the cost of field, office, and publication expenses of the maps at scale of the field minutes at 1 : 100,000 and 1 : 500,000. While the Institute has for its essential aim the production of maps for military needs, at the same time maps are supplied to the civil adminis tration, to which are added explanations and information specially valuable to the officers requiring them."], [349, "341 ITALY\u2014 GEOLOGIC. ITAXY. Geologic. The preparation of the Geological Map of Italy was intrusted by Royal decree of 1867 and 1868 to a committee (12 in number), composed of several distinguished geologists, named by the King, with a president, who is elected annually. Among the other members is the Director of the Military Geo graphical Institute at Florence. Sufficient funds were not at first granted, and upon the removal of the capital to Rome a new committee was formed by Royal decree of 1873. This committee was composed for the greater part of distinguished professors of geology, appointed by the King, with the Minister of Agriculture as a member, and also, among others, the Director of the Military Geographical Institute at Florence. Regulations require that each of the members should have supervision of the various belts of survey. The execution of the field work is intrusted to a section of Geological Engi neers, serving in the Royal Corps of Mines, under the direction of one of the inspectors of the corps (now Inspector-General F. Giordano), a member of the committee, and responsible directly to the Minister, the functions of the committee being principally consultive and directed to the exami nations and approval of projects and determination of special scientific questions arising during progress of the work. This section, with the local and scientific material of which they make use (including a library and collection of rocks and fossils), constitute the Geological Bureau for the preparation of the chart. The director makes a report at commencement of each year to the committee, which is by them transmitted through the Minister to Parliament. The observers must be selected from among youug men (engineer graduates), who have taken a course in a school of mines, if not in one of the best foreign geological institutes. Nevertheless, a Royal decree admits of the employment of geologists not members of the Corps of Mines, but professors and naturalists, who may have given proof of special aptitude for the work. Proper specialists are supplied also for the study of rock and fossil remains. The duties of the committee and the Geological Bureau consist (1) in the compilation of a general chart of"], [350, "342 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Italy (scale 1:500,000), placing upon it the known studies of the various geologists, (2) a systematic examination to obtain data for a detailed chart, based upon the new topographic map of the Military Institute (scale 1:100,000 in part, 1:50,000 in part, and 1:25,000 in part). This work has been directed to districts where detailed topographic maps were available, and which presented at the time special scientific and economic interests, as Sicily for sulphurs, the Apuan Alps for marble, the Silurian metal-bearing basin of the Inglesiente in Sardinia and the Roman Campagna. The survey of Sicily is complete, and that of the other mentioned regions nearly so. It is stated that the personnel of operators (of which at present there are 25 in all, 14 of whom are engineers of mines) was not completed until the year 1877-78, at which date the new topographic map with curves embraced a larger area of the more interesting regions of the Kingdom. The funds assigned annually at the commencement were 25,000 liras (approximately $5,00<\u00bb), which amount was afterwards increased to the annual sum of 60,000 liras. The sum of 80,000 liras is the largest jet granted, although it is understood that a proposed project of operations estimates for 200,000 liras ($40,000) per annum. It is also estimated that the work of obtaining the field data and compiling the same may be accomplished in about the year 1910, at a total cost of 5,000,000 liras (approximately $1,000,000). The funds are appropriated on the regular budget, submitted to and approved by the Italian Parliament. The central office is at Rome, with only one field office (temporary) at Pisa. The instruments used are clinometers and aneroids; the latter for ob taining special profiles and for comparing on the ground elevations given on the curve map. Independent of the map publications, of which there should be 956 sheets in all, on the scale of 1 : 50,000, there have been issued geological bulletins since 1870, which are still in progress, and memoirs, containing articles on various professional subjects, suspended after 3 vol umes had been issued, but which it is understood are soon to be resumed. At the Geological Congress at Bologna in 1881, 85 sheets of the Island of Sicily (scale 1:50,000), the result of observations begun 1862-63, were displayed. It was estimated in February, 1882, that about 33,500 square kilometers had been examined systematically in detail. The series of colors"], [351, "343 ITALY\u2014 GEOLOGIC. employed has been chosen to conform to the latest studies of the Interna tional Commission for the unification of the colors of oncological charts. Various special charts have also been issued, as of the Gulf of Spezzia (1:50,000) and the Appenines in the vicinity of Bologna (scale 1:100,000). The systematic publication of the geological maps is based on the topo graphic map at 1:100,000, in 277 sheets, of which 14 sheets of Sicily have already been issued \u2014 July, 1885. Districts of special importance will be published on the scale of 1:25,000. Elba Island, in 2 sheets, appeared in July, 1885, and also Elba again, in 1 sheet, scale 1 : 50,000, 1885. A general map, in 2 sheets, entitled \"Carta Geologica d' Italia,\" scale 1:1,111,111, was published in 1881, without topography, and also with the topography indicated, making in fact two separate maps. Another general map, on the scale of 1: 500,000, as previously stated, is in course of publication. The first sheet was issued in 1883, under the title of \"Carta geologica della Sicilia.\" Several other sheets are on the point of being distributed. All these charts are chroniolithographed at Rome, and well executed. The first geological map of Italy appeared in 1846, at Paris, under the title of \"Esquisse d'une Carte Geologique d'ltalie,\" by II. de Collegno, in 1 large sheet ; and the government of the Kingdom of Sardinia has had a geological examination, made by Angelo Sismunda, which published a gen eral map, entitled \"Carta Geologica di Savoja, Piemont e Liguria,\" 1866. The Austrian Geological Institute also, when the provinces of Lombardy and Venice belonged to Austria, published several geological maps of those provinces, the most important being \" Karte der Nordlichen Lombardie,\" by F. R. von Hauer, scale 1:432,000, Vienna, 1858.

SWEDEN. Topographic. The Kingdom of Sweden carries on through the Topographical Section of the General-Staff branch of the War Ministry, a topographic survey of its territory, from which results a general topographic map, scale 1 : 100,000. The area of Sweden is approximately 173,967 square miles, with a population in 1883 of 4,603,595, or an average of approximately 26 to the square mile. Naturally, the population of the southern and middle parts is much larger than the above average. CIVIL DIVISIONS. Sweden is divided into 3 regions, viz, Svea-land, Gothland, and Norr- land. The Kingdom is also divided into 24 \"Lans\" (counties) each presided over by a governor, the \"Lans\" are subdivided into 117 \" Fogder\" or dis tricts, each comprising one or more \" Harads\" or cantons, of which there are 264. The \" Harads\" are again subdivided into \" Socken\" (parishes). A \"Hemman\" is a part of a \"Socken\" and is of 3 descriptions, viz, \"Fralse\" (tax free), \" Krona\" (crown), and \" Skatte\" (tax paying), \" Hem man.\" MILITARY DIVISIONS. For administrative purposes the Kingdom is divided into 6 military divisional districts, subdivided into 49 battalion conscription districts, each of which again into 4 company districts. The French metric system in troduced in* 1875 is to be used exclusively in Sweden, after January 1, 1889. Prior to that date, it is being used concurrently with the old system. The importance of exact and detailed maps, not alone from a purely scientific standpoint, but as a response to legislative, administrative, and military requirements, has been recognized for more than two hundred years in Sweden. King Gustave Wasa was the first who caused to be prepared a statistical register of the parishes, the sketches accompanying"], [353, "345 SWEDEN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. which were executed by his private secretary. Olans Magni, archbishop of Upsala, made a small-scale map of Scandinavia (quite erroneous), which appeared at Venice in 1539, and a new edition in Basle in 1567. Charles IX, son of Gustave Wasa, interested himself greatly in these matters, and, after the peace of Tensina, caused to be run with care the boundary on the Russian side, maps resulting from which are still to be found in the state archives. Andrew Bure published a map of Lapland in 1611, the first engraved map in Sweden. In 1626 he produced the first map of Sweden, in 6 sheets, royal folio. The corps of Surveyor-Geometers (of whom one was employed to each province) was organized in '1 634-35, under the direction of Bure, named in 1628 \" General Mathematician,\" and who was charged with the prepara tion of maps of the provinces, making plans of ports, of mines, and towns, and inspection of public edifices. Nine maps, the results of this organiza tion, were published by authority of the Government, by the Bleau Brothers, of Amsterdam, from 1650 to 1660. The Bureau of Land Surveying received a more independent position in 1683. Several revised provincial, and a new general map, were issued, as well as a nautical chart of the Malar and the Stockholm Archipelago, the latter being used as a type for half a century. There was prepared in 1675 a map of Scandinavia, remarkable as indicating the extent of the forests of that epoch. During the reign of Charles XII great activity prevailed in nautical surveys, a collection of nautical charts appearing in 1737. In 1734 this Bureau received funds for the construction of a new map, and several were published from 1739 to 1745, and in 1747 a new general map of Sweden appeared. A special commission was organized at this period for the geological examination of Finland. About the close of the eighteenth century the execution of a complete cartographic work of the whole coun try was undertaken There had been issued in 1810 by the Geographic Institute, founded by Hermelin, the maps of all except three provinces. Rather comprehensive Swedish military maps were in course of prep aration as early as the beginning of 1770, in the neighboring country of Finland, under the direction of Major-General Sprengporten and Colonel"], [354, "346 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Klercker. There are in existence also earlier Pomeranian and Norwegian boundary maps prepared by the Royal Fortification Corps, which are a credit to those who executed them. The oldest trigcvnonietic extension known in Sweden, was laid out and measured between 1758 and 1761, from Cimbrishamn along the coast to the Norway boundary. An entirely new epoch in Swedish topographic operations was introducedinl805, when, at the suggestion of Maj. Gen. G. W. as Tibell, the Swedish Field Survey Corps was established* By the royal letter of April 16,1 805, and instructions of 1806, the object of this corps was declared to be to compile in time of peace com plete military maps ofthe Kingdom based on trigonometric and astronomic observations, accompanied by topographic, statistical, and military descrip tions. Necessary instructions for the execution of this work were given, among which were, that the scale for the field-work and the preliminary map should be 1:20,000, and for the so-called special maps which were to be compiled from them 1:100,000, and that the co^ps in time of war, in co-operation with the general staff of the army, should perform such duties as in most countries belong to the staff of a quartermaster-general. In con formity with this, by royal order of 1806, the title of \"quartermaster-gen eral,\" which subsequently has been applied to the chief of the fortification corps, was conferred on the chief of the field-survey corps. The balance of the force consisted of one lieutenant-general quartermaster, one major, one professor, four captains (of whom two were adjutants), six first lieu tenants, six second lieutenants, one clerk, and two draughtsmen. To the corps was joined a bureau, called \" archives of war,\" where all Government collections of domestic and foreign military maps, &c., formerly scattered in various places, were deposited, and funds were appropriated to increase the collections of the archives by yearly purchases of maps, books, and instruments. At the time of the Diet of 1809 the idea seems to have gained ground that the field survey had been wrongly separated from the fortification corps and ought to be reunited with it, economy being held forth as the motive for this union. The result was not entirely satisfactory. The Government declared in 1811 that both corps should be placed under one * General Tibell was of the school of Napoleon I, aud had labored under the direction of -the Emperor upon the completion of a map of tbe Italian Republic."], [355, "SWEDEN\u2014 TOP J GRAPHIC. 347 common chief, to which position, by general order of July 3, of the same year, Major General as Tibell was appointed. Shortly afterward it was ordered by the Government that the corps thus united should bear the name of \"The Royal Engineer Corps,\" but remain divided into two \"bri gades,\" the fortification and the field-survey brigade, each of which, main taining its order of promotion, should continue with the same duties which had hitherto been prescribed for it. The saving was slight and the union loose. It continued for twenty years. Doubts as to the practicability of the union with the fortification corps were expressed officially in 1814, principally on account of the duties which in the field fell on the field-survey brigade. Explorations, projects for trails, camps, positions, quarters, defenses, and the like, which in time of war belong to officers of the field-survey, have the most intimate connec- tion with the services of the General Staff, for which reason the brigade ought then to be in co-operation with the staff, and only in time of peace be separated from it. It was not until 1830, however, that in Sweden the question of the separation of the two brigades was brought up in earnest. This course was advised mainly by the then Chief of the Engineer Corps; after wliich, in 1831, the Government ordered that the field-survey brigade should be separated from the Engineer Corps, and, under the name of the Topographical Corps, should form a special division of the General Staff placed under the command of the Adjutant-General of the Army in all con- cerning the inspection of the corps and the general arrangement of the work. The new chief, the then brigade chief, Colonel Akrell, took charge and continued for a quarter of a century to devote his active care to the art of topography. In 1856 he resigned, and was succeeded by Col. J. A. Hazelius. By a royal order issued in 1831, the Topographical Corps was com pletely organized. The force was to consist of one colonel and chief, one major, one professor, three captains, six lieutenants, one draughtsman, and one messenger. Since January 1, 1874, the Topographical Corps has been dissolved and united with the reorganized General Staff. -The topographic work is now executed by the \"Topographical Division ofthe General Staff.\""], [356, "348 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Force Employed at the Map Establishment. Some officers of the army had already served from 1805 to 1815 in the field-survey corps. To hasten the surveys, it was directed in 1821 that officers with some skill in map drawing should be ordered from the army every year as assistants in the summer work of the field-survey brigade. If this assistance was required at that time, it was still more called for when, through the organization of 1831, the strength of the corps from 21 per sons, to which it had shortly before amounted, gradually decreased to 11 officers of the regular service. In 1834 a rule was established that to fill the places of second lieu tenants withdrawn, a number of army officers sufficient for the work at the time should be detailed, and together with the topographical officers and under the command of the latter, should make field-surveys and work per taining thereto; these officers being required to have as much skill in field surveying and map drawing as is demanded of the cadets at graduation. In this way the map work was hastened, and the army officers gained ex perience in surveying. But most of the officers detailed served altogether too short a time to benefit the map work in proportion to the expense. Experience- has proved that two or more summers, according to different natural talent, are required for gaining sufficient skill in complete field-sur veying; and as according to custom only one-third continues the third summer, when the principal gain for the map work would begin, in 1847 it was ordered that there should be employed for continuous service, for a term of three years, six or at most eight officers who had previously served in the corps at least one year. The number of applicants was never equal to the demand. To supply the deficiency and to have a permanent work ing force at command, the Royal Majesty or the Government permitted in 1858, at the request of the chief, the employment in the corps of eight sub officers (guicler) who were to devote themselves exclusively to map drawing, in order to attain the technical skill desired. At the end of 1873, shortly before the topographic corps was entirely united with the General Staff, these sub officers were relieved, but those wishing to continue to devote their time to map* drawing were .retained under the name of extra assistants. Three of these who had for some years been engaged in map engraving were employed as engravers."], [357, "349 SWEDEN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. In 1811 a map showing topographic reliefs was published. In 1825 a new general map of Scandinavia to latitude 64\u00b0 N. was constructed and engraved (scale 1:500,000). The projection employed for the General Topographic Map (scale 1:100,000 \u2014 232 sheets, including Lapland) is called the \"Crescent\" or in creasing conic. It claims to give to the ground, provided it is not of too great extent, its absolutely true form, an advantage wliich is obtained by causing the scale to increase from the middle parallel both to the north and south. The cone, the development of which, determines the map surface, cuts the terrestrial spheroid along the parallels of 56\u00b0 37' 31\". 5 and 68\u00b0 22' 59\". 5, for which lines the error of projection is zero. The maximum error is 0.0021, and falls upon the frontier latitudes north and south 65\u00b0 50' 20\".4 and 55\u00b0 21' 19\".4, as well as upon the par allel equivalent to the half sum ofthe degrees ofthe conic angle 60\u00b0 44' 29\". 6. The principal meridian adopted is that which passes 5\u00b0 west of the Observatory of Stockholm, coinciding closely with the mean meridian of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The meridians appear as straight lines and the parallels as concentric circles. In the documents of the Royal Scientific Academy for 1817 appears an investigation of the formul\u00e6 pertaining to this method. The compression of the globe is assumed \u2014 1:304.2607, and the radius at the equator \u2014 6,376,797.06 meters. A triangulation net of the first order surrounds the southern and mid dle coast of Sweden ; it is in relation with different triangulation chains executed equally exact along both meridians and parallels.* Triangulation determinations of the second and third order within the chains of the prin cipal net, have furnished from time to time, in the surveyed portions of the country, a sufficient number of points for the atlas.

It will still have to be continued from 10 to 15 years."], [358, "350 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. tion of the southern and middle parts is completed the geodetic work will be pursued with more vigor in the north. Already the Bureau of Hydrog raphy has commenced its surveys by a triangulation net starting from the vicinity of Haparanda, a point ofthe Russo-Scandinavian degree measure ment, and following the western coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. The work will be continued by the united forces of the Bureau of Hydrography and of the Topographical Section of the General Staff. The Observatory of Stockholm forms the point d'appui of all the tri angulation of Sweden. Besides, the Observatory of the University of Lund has been taken in the midst of a special triangulation into the principal net by the assistance of the Academy of Sciences of Stockholm. Different deter minations of polar altitudes have, however, been made as control upon the several triangulation points; the situation ofthe net has been fixed by azi niuthal operations upon one of the sides of the triangle, starting out from the Observatoiy of Stockholm and upon several other lines of the net. Bases determine the length of the sides, six alone responding to the actual exigencies from the point of view of accuracy. Of these lines one was measured in 1840 by the old Topographical Corps by means of the Bessels apparatus. Three older lines exist, measured on the ice by appa ratus of older construction. The two last periods have inaugurated the first work of the complete hypsometric measure of the country. This measure was made, part by the Topographical Section and part by the Geological Bureau. The labors of these two corps are based on a common plan and are in mutual connection. The measures are performed by means of levels, and based upon the mean height of waters of the Cattegat and Baltic, as established by long years of hydrographic observations taken near the light houses of Sweden. Lines of levels from several points joining one sea with the other have been established. They run in a general direction from east to west, and are cut by other lines going from north to south. From these lines, acting as a control, set out the detailed levels by means of wliich the number of points necessary for the map are determined. The trigonometric leveling has also been connected with the triangulation. The scales of the difierent maps are: For the general map, 1:1,000,000; for the maps of provinces, 1:200,000; for special map, 1:100,000; field minutes, 1:50,000;"], [359, "SWEDEN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 351 for maps of position and special localities the scale is 1 : 20,000, or 1 : 10,000, and even greater yet, according to the object of the map. The special map (1 : 100,000) is divided into rectangular sheets of 2 feet (Swedish, 594mm) in length and 1\u00a3 feet (445mm) in width. The sheets, of which the sides are either parallel or perpendicular to the principal merid ian, are numbered in Roman figures from east to west of this meridian ; from north to south they bear Arabic numbers, commencing at the perpen dicular to the meridian at 72\u00b0 latitude north. The maps to the east ofthe meridian aforementioned are marked with the letters 0 (Oster \u2014 east) and those to the west with the letter V (Vester \u2014 west) ; thus, Stockholm belongs to the mapV. O. 32 (zz5, Eq,st, N. 0.32). Each map receives, besides, the name of a town or other marked locality situated within it. There existed in the Survey Bureau (General Landtmateri-Kontor) at Stockholm the cen tral archives, where are preserved copies of all the geometric maps each Government possesses, besides special records where the originals are pre served. By their number, and on account of the large scale upon which they have been prepared, these maps are of assistance and value to the mil itary cartography of the country. There has been established since 1812 a system of cartographic sketches, upon which are transferred, at the scale adopted for field minutes, all the geometric maps which have not become useless because of age or other circumstances. The regions for which there exist no maps that can be utilized are submitted to a rapid reconnaissance and are laid down upon the canvas by aid of triangulation points. It is upon copies of these sketches that the surveys upon the ground are laid down. Such has been and such is yet, to a certain extent, the process em ployed for the composition of maps. A second process has been taken in hand since 1873, when the work went into the hands of the General Staff. In making use of the determinations of places made by it, this authority prepares with the same projection (scale 1:20,000) a general map of the middle and southern country. In regions where the labors of the economic survey precede those of the military survey at 1:50,000, the maps of the economic surveys are reduced to that scale and the topographic work on the ground executed after copies of these reductions.

The scale of 1:50,000 has been adopted since 1844, and 67,500 square miles covered up to 1871 in southern Sweden. The surveys on the ground executed by ten or twelve officers under the command of an officer of the General Staff are made with all the exactitude possible for that scale. The peaks are esti mated by the aid of a little hand level, and laid down upon the map by a scale of hachures. The hypsometric measures precede the topography. Wher ever these measures have been made the absolute heights are inscribed upon the original map to the number of 20 to 25 points per square mile. The maps are then reduced to the scale of 1: 100,000, to serve as a model for the engraver. Simultaneously with the survey of the ground is made up a topo graphic description, military and statistical, of the district covered. Be fore 1857 the map at scale 1 : 100,000 was held secret. In the main it was composed of originals drawn by hand, but it was ordered in 1826 that these should be engraved and the engraving executed by officers of the corps, who, pursuant to an oath exacted of them, were responsible for the secrecy of the map during as well as after completion. The engraving was by hand, on copper. When, in 1857, the King permitted, at the suggestion of the chief of the Topographical Corps, the publication of these maps, 20 were found too old to be published, and 11 only could be promulgated after cor rections from new field observations. The engraving of the more recent maps is executed by hand on copper by permanent and contract employe's. Since 1857, and up to 1882, 64 sheets have been engraved in this manner. The Topographical Corps is charged since 1832 to publish as fast as the map 1 : 100,000 is proceeded with, maps ofthe several Governments or provinces, scale 1 : 200,000, accompanied by statistical descriptions. Fifteen of these maps, comprising 10 provinces, have been engraved. This publication was suspended until further orders until 1872. There has been in preparation since 1865, a general map, scale 1 : 1,000,000, in 3 sheets, two of which have already appeared, and the third is being engraved. Besides, the General Staff is occupied in the preparation on a much larger scale of military maps of important strategic points. These last are held secret. The annual appropriation inscribed in the budget for"], [361, "SWEDEN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 353 \u2713 topographical work of the General Staff is 90,000 crowns (about 125,000 francs) since 1878, but this appropriation does not include the salaries of the General Staff officers. The revenue from the sale of maps reverts to the survey fund. The force employed on the topographical work in the summer of 1875 was 28 persons,, among whom were 8 officers, 1 professor and 2 assistants belonging to the General Staff, 12 officers of the army and 5 civil assistants. In the succeeding winter 24 persons were employed, 10 belonging to the General Staff, 5 civil assistants, 9 detailed officers, independent of 7 engravers. There had been expended from 1812 to 1874 for the Swedish Topo graphical Atlas 1,682,799 Swedish crowns, or $451,831.53, at the rate of 26.85 cents for a crown. Description of the Topographic Map \u2014 '(Scale 1:100,000). \u2014 Engraved on copper, partly in hachures, printed in four colors, and published at Stockholm. Commenced 1815. The area of each sheet is about 1,008 stat ute square miles (24 Swedish square miles). The size of paper for each sheet is 31.7 by 23.3 inches, and the inside border 23 by 17.5 inches. Fol lowing the plan resolved upon by the King in 1815, this map and that of Norway were commenced simultaneously and would have formed together a s}7stem of Scandinavian maps, the same scale and projection being adopted for both countries, but agreement could not be had upon the dimensions and form of the sheets, nor upon the proposition to adopt a common initial \u2014 meridian 5 degrees west of Stockholm \u2014 which led to the establishment of a separate national map for Norway, based upon a different meridian. The trigonometric chains are connected with those of Russia by the topographers of both countries executed simultaneously upon both banks of the sea of Aland. The Danish geographical engineers have carried this connection to the coasts of Skaane and the Isle of Seland, and the triangu lation of Norway has been connected with that of Sweden. In this man ner a geodetic connection has been established between the three principal Scandinavian observatories, Stockholm, Christiania, and Copenhagen. The Swedish forms also an important link in the trigonometric system of Europe. This work has been performed by the best of observers, the most perfect instruments, and by using all known precautions for producing the best 1366 WH 23"], [362, "354 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. V results. The mean error of the longest base near Lake Vetter from Laholm to the Stockholm Archipelago (70 Swedish miles = 465 English miles and 87 stations) has been calculated not to exceed 2.75 Swedish feet, while the error of bases measured near Copenhagen, and upon the Isle of Aland has been determined to be 1 inch to 18,434 feet, or 1:221,208. Astronomic checks for longitude, latitude, and azimuths have been availed of in com bining the Danish and Swedish triangulation. For the topographic details there have been reduced the cadastral charts (scale 1:15,000); others of the land survey Bureau of Stockholm, and those of other principal places have been reduced to scale 1 : 50,000. These reduced maps are gathered in a topographic sketch for assistance in the astronomic and triangulation operations. These minutes are completed upon the ground and reduced to 1 : 100,000 scale for the engraver in regular sheets. The topographical drawing is based upon the system of equidistant horizontal curves. The projections along the greatest declivities are in terrupted at the intersection of the horizontal curves, and broken hachures, shaded according to declivity, mark the space. The water is shown in blue. Rough ground is represented in a special manner by means of curves nearly equidistant, the thickness being propor tioned to the declivity. This work \" is accompanied by topographical, statistical, and military memoirs, according to parishes, and reduced in the description of arrondissements and governments. The geological atlas of the Kingdom is based upon the topographic maps of the General Staff at the above scale (1 : 100,000), and also that of 1 : 200,000 for the more thinly inhabited portions.

On the margin of each sheet appears an explanation of conventional signs, special plans of cities and of fortifications on the scale of 1:20,000, and scales in Swedish miles for the map proper and in \"ells\" for the city plans. The mountains are represented by lines for the greatest declivities and gentle tints. The limits of governments, arrondissements, and parishes are indi cated by different colors ; waters in blue. Topographical and statistical memoirs are issued with these maps. Independent of the above the following scales are employed: 1 : 1,000, 000 for a generalized map ; 1 : 50,000 for field-work of the special map ; 1 : 20,000 for map of passes and positions, and 1 : 10,000 for more impor tant passes and positions. Surveys on scales 1 : 2,000 and 1 : 5,000 have also been made for special studies and purposes. ECONOMIC SURVEY. For the geological examination of the Swedish parishes, which had been incumbent heretofore upon the Central Bureau, there was created in 1859 a special administration, that of the \"Economic Survey of the Kingdom\" (Rikets ekonomiska Kartwerk), with the object of procuring a certain knowl edge of the surface of the country and of its natural divisions from the point of view of agricultural and industrial economy. This work is divided into two sections, one general for the entire coun try and one special for North Bothnia, which, comprehending the most northerly part of the country, necessitated a separate work, because of its great extent and poor state of culture. The maps are at a scale of 1 : 20,000. They are prepared by using the Arpentage maps in connection with those for fixing triangulation points. All the triangulation is made by the Topo graphical Section of the General Staff. In North Bothnia the scales of 1 : 20,000 and 1 : 50,000 have been used, the latter having been employed specially for Lapland. This is the first time that veritable topographic labors have been made in this distant region. The regions of which the cartographic survey has taken place until now are central Sweden (partly measured in 1860-74, 235 Swedish square miles _= 26,850 kilometers"], [364, "356 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. square), and a part of the government of North Bothnia (620 Swedish square miles __r 70,800 kilometers square). Lithographic maps have been published of the governments of Upsala and Orebro for some districts of the government of Kopparberg of scale 1 : 100,000 ; 62 sheets in all had appeared in 1882. Although the surveys are made at the expense of the State, the publication depends upon the com munes and individuals. The appropriation found in the budget of 1876 is 87,000 crowns (121,000 francs), of which 42,000 francs for North Bothnia. The personnel is composed of 19 cartographers, 11 aids (draughtsmen), of whom 8 are females, and of 2 officers of the General Staff. The Economic Survey has had part of the time a special chief, again has been under the orders of the Director-General of Arpentage, and for North Bothnia under the governor of that province, but now proceeds under the Topographical Section of the General Staff. LAND SURVEY MAPS. The activity actually shown in cartography \u2014 geometric, geographic, hydrographic, and military \u2014 in Sweden belonged in olden times exclusively to the Surveyor-Geometers (landtmatare), of wliich the first chief, Bure, received his instructions as early as 1628. In the course of time the sur veyors saw their labors reduced successively to a geometric survey of the ground. At the present time their Bureau corresponds pretty nearly, thanks to its collection of maps during 250 years, to that which is called in other countries the \"Cadastre.\" One of the most ordinary operations of this service is that named \" Lagaskifte,\" or legal subdivision. Everywhere there are grounds, belonging above all to large villages, that have been suc cessively parceled out for cultivation in a mass of little lots. The necessity exists of reuniting them anew by a better exploitation in larger lots or more frequently into a single lot. All the lands thus measured and subdivided are distributed proportionately among the inhabitants of the village. The law authorizes the smallest proprietor even in demanding the aid of the Surveyor-Geometer for a new division and relocation of the entire village. This important law dates from 1827. The considerable parceling out of the ground of Dalecarlia has given birth to a special sort of repar-"], [365, "SWEDEN\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 357 tition, the \"storskifte,\" or grand subdivision. There belongs to this service, besides, the \"afvittring\" \u2014 delineations of grounds \u2014 of which the principal object is to separate private properties (particularly forests) from the public domain and turn them over to cultivation upon given conditions. These are nearly completed, except in Lapland. The Arpentage maps are, as well as the descriptions of the domains, ordinarily prepared in triplicate, of which one is for the proprietor, the original is deposited in the Bureau of Arpentage of each Government, and the third goes to the Central Bureau. These maps up to a certain point correspond to foreign cadastral maps. They are not made public by print ing, and their ordinary scale is that of 1 : 4,000, although the scales of 1 : 2,000 and 1 : 8,000 are equally authorized. By compilation and reduction to 1 : 20,000 these sheets are prepared as district maps, the object of which is to give an accurate knowledge of the extent and the natural division of the country as regards agriculture and industry. These planimetric maps are reduced to 1:50,000, and reproduced by lithography. The Corps of Surveyor-Geometers, under the orders of the Director- General, numbered, in 1875, 600 functionaries and employe's, distributed among the different Governments. Actually the proprietors of land pay in that manner alone for the \"laga skifte\" a total annual sum of 700,000 Swedish crowns (approximately 980,000 francs), not including the expenses occasioned by incidental work. The amount annually appropriated by the State is about 300,000 crowns (approximately 420,000 francs), so that -this service costs annually 1,000,000 crowns =1,400,000 francs = approximately $280,000. The land in Sweden belongs principally to the peasants, and it is considered that this sum is well expended. Note. \u2014 The data for Sweden has been gathered from a translated memoir (dated November 16, 1875) of Colonel von Vegesack, chief of the Topographical Division of the General Staff, found in Com stock's notes, pp. 76 to 91, and from various other official authoritative sources. For the scales of the different maps, see \" Lists of Maps,\" pp. 116 and 132."], [366, "358 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. SWED.KJN Geologic. The geological exploration of Sweden was organized in 1855, at the expense of the State, pursuant to a request of the agricultural society of the Government of Upsala and of the seventh Swedish agricultural convention. Upon the favorable report both of the Academy of Agriculture and of Sciences, the Government submitted to the Diet, for this purpose, a project of appropriation for 60,000 rixdalers or crowns (approximately 84,000'francs or $16,800) for three years from 1858-60, which was approved. The official instructions of April 27, 1858, for the execution of the work (Sveriges Geologiska Undersoking) prescribed a common plan for the entire investigation, with the principal object of studying the geognostic conformation of the country, having in view the requirements of science, agriculture, and industry, as well as to render the information public by means of maps and detailed descriptions. The first explorations (1858) were directed to the districts of Upsala and the neighboring portions of Stockholm and Westmanlan, looking to a map of the basin of the Malar. When the results of two years' work, based on the military topo graphic map (scale 1:50,000), were submitted to the Diet in 1859, it was decided to publish them on a scale sufficiently large to reproduce com pletely and with the necessary clearness everything that might Serve as a guide to agriculture or technical industry. Hence the alluvial beds have been delineated, thus giving a true image of the country and especially its agricultural capacity. The scale of 1 : 50,000 has not alwa)7s been employed for recording the field observations, especially in the uniform and sparsely populated regions, where the scale of 1:100,000 suffices for the wants of field exploration and the scale of 1 : 200,000 for the published maps. These latter maps are accompanied by others strictly petrographic, with rock indi cations. The original topographic map (scale 1:50,000) of the General Staff has generally been employed as the basis of the cartographic publi cations, the geological colors being superposed directly thereupon, while as well economic maps and that of the (Etat-Major) General Staff (scale"], [367, "359 SWEDEN\u2014 GEOLOGIC. 1:100,000 as published) have been utilized. There had been explored to the close of 1874, at scale 1:50,000, about 366 square miles (Swedish) = 16,145 square statute miles, and at that of 1:100,000, 70 square miles (Swedish) = 3,088 square statute miles. In July, 1884, there had been published 83 lithographic maps (scale 1 : 50,000) in colors, with geological descriptions and paleontological memoirs, and 10 at scale 1 : 200,000. Since this date the work has steadily progressed. Special levelings are made over lines of considerable extent, and simultane ously material for a general geological map has been in course of collection. Special explorations have also been made in the most distant and least known portions of the country. Several monographs and various scientific memoirs have been published, based upon more detailed geologic and pale ontologic investigations. The publications are continuous and increasing. An additional mission of this establishment is to answer to the wants of practical or economic geology. To this end special explorations are made in the oil and mining regions (the latter having been vigorously prosecuted in Lapland) and technic-economic and agronomic-geologic works issued. Special ancient burial fields, as well as monuments of prehistoric ages, are scrupulously noted, and reproduced upon the maps by special conventional signs. Thus the work called for has been not alone to produce a geological atlas of the country, but to constitute a scientific institution, and to meet wants of technical industry, metallurgy, as well as agriculture, by means of practical geologic researches, established on a scientific basis. The appropriations have successively increased, having reached, in 1876, the sum of 70,300 crowns, approximately 98,000 francs = $19,600. There are 12 persons employed, including the chief or director, now Prof. Otto Torell ; the first director having been Alex. Erdmann, from 1858 to 1868, who was succeeded by A. E. Tornebohm, from 1869 to 1870. To the above there is added during the summer a greater or less number of geo logical aids, whose duties are more of a mechanical nature. The winter months are devoted to the preparation and completion of the maps and the reduction of descriptions and monographs and to chemical analysis, to micro scopic studies, all of which is carried on in a Government building at Stock holm, one feature of which is a long and high hall for a geological museum. with working chambers, library, chemical laboratory, &c."], [368, "360 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Besides the geological maps at the scales of 1 : 200,000 and 1 : 50,000, the Royal Geological Institute of Sweden has published other charts. A few with special reference to the superficial deposits and to agriculture, such as the environs of Skottorp, province of Halland, scales 1:20,000 and 1:4,000. Also some special maps referring to mining, as \"Carte gdologique de la Scania,\" scale 1:400,000, in relation to the carboniferous formation of Scania, by Ed. Erdmann; the \"Geologisk ofversigtskarta ofver Mellersta Sveriges Berglog,\" in 9 sheets, scale 1:250,000, by A. E. Tornebohm, for the iron district of Central Sweden. Finally, a general map at the scale of 1:1,000,000, under the title of \"Geologisk ofversigtskarta ofver Sverige,\"is in course of publication ; the first sheet was issued in 1884, with a description in French entitled \"Annexe explicative a la carte ge'ologique de la Suede; feuille meYidionale par A.

The principal topographic work now being executed for Russia by the General Staff of the War Department is the general topographic map of Russia in Europe -(scale 1 : 126,000, approximately 972 sheets). The total area embraced by the Russian Empire in Europe, (including Poland and Finland) is 2,129,201* square miles, with a population in 1882 of 83,909,945, or a mean of 39 to the square mile.

These are subdivided into circles (ovyezds). It is contemplated to redistribute the Empire into army-corps districts, a scheme which will probably be carried out by the year 1889. At present there are 19 army-corps districts distrib uted amongst the 14 districts. It was intended to introduce the metrical system in Russia to be obliga tory in 1883. The earliest known geographical knowledge of Russia, consisting of descriptions of real estate by Mongolian fiscal agents, dates from the middle of the thirteenth century. The first general map was made about the mid dle of the sixteenth century and a printed map of Russia (with Latin inscrip tion), published at Amsterdam in 1614, is found in the General Staff Bureau. Peter the Great was the first to fully realize the necessity of an accurate geographical knowledge of his country. He ordered surveys, the prepara tion of maps, descriptions of districts in 1720, and provided for collecting all needful information as regards topography. Scientifically executed tri angulation dates from 1816 in Russia. The Topographical Corps (constituting the topographic section of the Chief or General Staff), to which is confided the functions and duties of the"], [370, "362 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. great general survey of the country, consists of 6 generals, 15 colonels, 16 lieutenant-colonels, 31 captains, 31 staff- captains, 31 lieutenants, 31 sub lieutenants, 32 ensigns, 170 classed surveyors (from 7 to 14 classes), 240 topographical under-officials, and 40 topographical pupils. Appointment to the General Staff can only be obtained by those officers who have passed the Nicolas Academy creditably. The course in the surveying branch, to which only 10. officers are annually admitted, lasts four years. The Chief or General Staff is divided into six principal subdepartments and a number of others, among them the Military Topographic Department, with its own director, which carries out all astronomic, trigonometric, topo graphic, and map-making work. It is divided into the trigonometric sec tion (including the instrument office), the map-making establishment (includ ing the drawing and coloring divisions and the bookbinding, engraving, printing, lithographic, and photographic branches), the Chancery, the Mili tary Topographic Depot, and the map-selling depot. Since surveys of this country took an organic form their administra tion has been confided to the War Department There had been for a long period a geographical department of the Academy of Sciences, but all scien tific land surveys of a general character are now made by the Topograph ical Corps of the General Staff. In 1765 a general cadastral survey of all the real estate was begun, wliich terminated towards the commencement of the present century. The principal topographic works now being prosecuted in Russia are: (1) The field-work (scales 1:21,000 and 1:42,000, published in speci fied instances) and office work requisite for the construction and publica tion of the great general topographic map of Russia in Europe, in 972 sheets, scale 1 : 126,000, which includes at same scale 59 sheets for Poland.

HISTORICAL. The following has been taken from a Russian official document enti tled \"A Historical sketch of the operations of the Corps of Military To pographers, 1822-1872.\"* The book itself is divided into four parts, the first containing a brief review of the astronomic, topographic, and carto graphic work accomplished in Russia prior to the establishment of the Corps of Military Topographers; the second, an account of the organization of the corps and its operations up to 1832 (first reorganization); the third, its work from 1832 to 1867 (last reorganization); the fourth, a re view ofthe (then, 1872,) present condition of this corps. The oldest geographical knowledge of Russia, consisting of descrip tions of real estate by the fiscal agents of the Mongolian occupation, dates from the middle of the thirteenth century. The first general manuscript map of the Russian Dominions was prepared by order of the Czar of Mos cow, in the middle ofthe sixteenth century, and was entitled \"The Great drawing.\" This map, as well as a copy of the same known to have been made in 1627, are lost. Of the oldest printed maps of Russia, there is in the scientific military archives of the General Staff Office one published at Amsterdam in 1614 with Latin inscriptions. The map is constructed on a conical projection, and contains many errors. Peter the Great was the first ruler of Russia who fully realized the necessity of an accurate geographical knowledge of the Empire. In 1720 he issued an ukase ordering 30 young men from the Naval Academy to be sent into various provinces for the making of surveys, preparation of maps, and description of the various regions. These young men were des ignated as Geometers. Surveys were to be made by districts ; the lati tudes to be determined for cities, and a few points along the frontiers be tween the districts, and the longitudes to be taken from old maps and \" From translation by S. N. Buynitzky, Customs Division, Treasury Department."], [372, "364 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. catalogues. It is known that the latitudes were determined by means of quadrants. The general supervision of the work of the Geometers was intrusted to the Senate, and the maps were edited under the supervision of the chief clerk of the Senate. In 1726 the Empress Katherine I ordered all the maps prepared by the Geometers to be transferred to the. Academy of Sciences for correc tion and preparation of new and more accurate maps. At the same time the two French astronomers, the brothers Delille, had arrived from France, upon the invitation of the Empress, and were appointed members of the Academy in charge of the Government surveys. While the brothers De lille were engaged in the work intrusted to them, the chief clerk of the Senate, Mr. Kiriloff, edited and published, at his own expense in 1734, a Latin atlas comprising 1 general and 14 special maps, con tructed on a conical projection. The scale of the general map is about 1 inch to 142 miles, and the scales of the special maps are from four to five times larger. In 1739 a special division was organized in the Academy of Sciences under the name of Geographical Department, under the joint supervision of Academicians Delille, senior, and Euler. In 1741, the Department was intrusted to Academician Heinzius. In 1745, the Geographical Depart ment published an atlas, comprising 1 general and 19 special maps, 13 of which represent European Russia on a scale of about 1 inch to 32 miles, and 6 (maps), Asiatic Russia on a smaller scale. The general map, on 2 sheets, embraces the whole Empire on a scale of about 1 inch to 103 miles. From 1727 to 1760 various astronomical expeditions had taken place which were continued up to the year 1789 with satisfactory results. In 1765 the Empress Katherine II ordered the making of a general survey of all the real estate of the Empire. In consequence of this order, a corps of Government surveyors was organized, and a school for the prep aration of\" surveyors was established under the name of Constantine's Sur vey Institute. Fifteen years later the Survey Department of the Senate and the special school for draughtsmen and surveyors were established. Towards 'the commencement of the present century the survey of all the landed estates in European Russia was completed."], [373, "RUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 365 The necessity of military topography had already been felt by the ancient rulers of Russia, but in this branch, as in every other, Peter the Great was the first to lay the foundation of a definite system. He estab lished the office of Quartermaster-General (the commencement of the Gen eral Staff), and made it part of its duties to collect all needful information in regard to military topography and roads for the movement of armies. Under the immediate successors of Peter the Great the military topogra phy was centered in the Engineer Department of the War College. In 1763 Empress Katherine II established a General Staff, to consist of 40 officers, most of whom were attached to the Military College to serve under the special orders of the Quartermaster-General. In the latter part of the eighteenth century, a number of military route maps were prepared by the officers of the General Staff. The foremost place among the works of the staff for that period belongs to the survey completed in 1797 ofthe Government of Lithuania, which comprises about 40,000 square miles, the scale of one-half of which is 1 :56,000 and the other half 1 : 112,000. In 1796 Emperor Paul created the Imperial Office of Draughtsmen, which was converted in 1797 into an Imperial Depot of Charts, and thus laid the foundation for the Military Topographical Division of the General Staff. The Depot of Maps was intended not only as a military, but also as a complete State Depot of maps and plans. The collection of maps accumulated in the Engineer Department and the office of the Quarter ter-General were transferred to the depot, which was placed under the immediate command of a Major of Engineers. The personnel of the depot was obtained by means of details of superior and subaltern officers from the Corps of Engineers and of other parts of the army. In 1798 an office of draughtsmen was added to the Depot of Charts The office consisted of eight artists. In 1801 the Depot of Charts was put under the command of the Q uartermaster-General. In 1811 the Quartermaster-General was authorized to establish a me chanical workshop for the manufacture of surveying instruments."], [374, "366 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. After the establishment of the Ministry of War in 1812, the Depot of Charts was transferred, under the name of Military Topographical Depot, under the immediate supervision of the Minister of War, and was reorgan ized so as to form a Bureau in the Ministry of War, under a special director, with a sufficient number of clerks, subdivided into six divisions, each with a chief. The Minister of War was at the same time authorized to detail for service in the Military Topographical Depot the necessary number of supe rior and subaltern officers from the quartermaster and engineer branches of the army. For the expenses of the Military Depot the annual sum of 44,000 rubles was appropriated, and the director was authorized to sell such maps as might be published and to apply the sums realized to defray the expenses of the depot. In 1816 the Military Topographical Depot was put under the command of the Director of the General Staff, and became an integral part of the staff, undergoing at the same time some modifications in regard to the per sonnel and the subdivision of the work. The sphere of its action was gradually increasing up to 1822. Up to the second half of the eighteenth century the engraving for Russian maps was executed by means of aqua-fortis. The outlines of the maps of that period are coarse. Most of the inscriptions are represented by initials of the Sclavonian alphabet. In the second half of the century a marked' tendency towards improvement in engraving is noticed. Between 1806 and 1815 the academician Vishnievski determined the latitudes and longitudes of 225 points of the vast area bounded on the west by Libau (38\u00b0 40' east longitude), on the east by Ecaterinburg (78\u00b0 21'), on the north by Mezen (65\u00b0 50' north latitude), and on the south by Elbrus Mountain (43\u00b0 21'). Upon a comparison of 40 of these determinations with the most modern observations, the academician Struve found that the latitudes are exact within 5 seconds in arc, and the longitudes within 2 seconds in time. Up to the year 1816 the only completed trigonometric work was the survey, in 1809, of the city of St. Petersburg. Some work was done in"], [375, "RUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 367 1810-11, with a view of connecting by a trigonometric net the cities of St. Petersburg, Narev, Reval, and Dorpat. The undertaking was brought to a stop by the war of 1812. Eighteen hundred and sixteen is the year of the commencement in Russia of strictly scientific triangulations, the series of wliich was opened by the trigonometric survey of the government of Wilna. The triangles \u25a0 with a probable error of observation of dt 0\".62) were generally of a regular form, the average lengths of the sides being equal to 1 1 miles. Between 1816 and 1819, the economical association of Liefland in trusted to Prof. W. G Struve the direction of a work which, aside from its immediate result, deserves particular notice on account of its far-reaching consequences. This was the astronomo-trigonometric survey of Liefland, which led ultimately to a great degree measurement along the western borders of Russia. The principal base, 6\u00a3 miles in length, was measured upon the ice on the lake Vir Yarvi. The triangulation proved so accurate that 15 sides of it subsequently entered into the great Russian degree measurement, which is justly considered as one of the most accurate. The points determined by this net were placed upon the conical pro- Action of the map of Liefland, according to the method of rectangular rectilinear co-owlinates. In 1 820, Colonel Schubert was directed to prepare a trigonometric net for the topographic survey of the district of Schliisselburg, and to connect the net with St. Petersburg, extending the tier of triangles over a space of about 50 miles. The order was, however, soon modified so as to lay a foundation for a connected triangulation of the government of St. Petersburg and other neighboring governments. At the issue of the great wars with Napoleon I, the Russian Govern ment was thoroughly impressed with the necessity of military surveys of ihe western regions of the Empire, and became aware of the inadequacy of the means at its disposal for the carrying into effect of so vast an under taking. The force at the disposal of the General Staff consisted of 37 generals and officers, and the force under the orders of the Quartermaster- General consisted of 189 generals and officers The details from this force for topographic purposes were therefore considerably restricted, both in"], [376, "368 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. the number of officers and the time to be given to such details. The force of draughtsmen and engravers at the disposal of the Military Topographic Depot was also too small, in view of the vast and pressing task proposed. These considerations led to the creation of a special institution upon a scale of particular magnitude heretofore unknown in the administration of the topographic branch. On January 28, 1822, the Emperor approved a plan for the establish ment of a Corps of Topographers, as a branch of the Imperial General Staff. The corps to consist of an unlimited number of officers and of as many privates, to be designated as topographers, as may be found competent in the schools of military cantonists (sons of soldiers who died in the service), and to be commanded by a director under the orders of the Quartermaster- General. At the same time a school to be established for the instruction of topographers, to be imparted by officers of the General Staff and of the Corps of Topographers. A special uniform was granted to the officers and privates of the corps and to the pupils of the school. The organization of the Corps of Topographers was somewhat modified by the supplementary decree of May 14, 1822. The topographers of the corps (privates) are divided into two classes: Class 1, corporals ;. class 2, privates. The graduates of the school to be placed in one of the two classes, according to progress. The topographers of the first class theretofore exist ing in the various corps of the army could be promoted to the rank of offi cer in the Corps of Topographers, upon examination. The graduates of the school could be promoted without examination, upon meritorious service. It was made the duty of the director of the school of topographers to keep an exact register, not only of the topographers in the school, but also of all the topographers in the various corps of the army. After the completion of the course of studies (four years) in the school, each topographer was to be supplied at the Government expense with a complete set of surveying instruments. Officers of various corps who desired to be admitted to the Corps of Topographers had to pass a special examination. The quartermas ters of the various corps of the army were directed to keep the director of topographers duly informed of the number, names, and conduct of the topog raphers attached to the several corps."], [377, "RUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 369 Those of the officers of the army who desired to be transferred to the Corps of Topographers were allowed to follow a course of astronomy by Professor Struve, at the University of Dorpat. The organization of the Corps of Military Topographers did not remain without a corresponding favorable influence upon the condition of the mili tary topographic depot The system of cataloguing was greatly improved, and two valuable catalogues were completed in the interval of time between 1825 and 1830 \u2014 1, a general catalogue comprising 17 volumes and over 35,000 numbers ; and, 2, a special systematic catalogue comprising 50 col umns of lists of maps, and also of copper plates, of which there were already 3,200 numbers. In 1830 an index to the catalogues was prepared. Between the years 1825 and 1839 the triangulations (average error of observation 0\".49) of the governments of Kourland, Grodna, and Minsk were completed. In 1830 the triangulations of Eastern Prussia were connected with the Russian triangulations, and the work was done with considerable accuracy, as shown by the following insignificant differences found between the com mon sides of the two triangulations, viz : a^io, and 23-im- Between 1822 and 1827 Baron Wrangel, lieutenant ofthe Russian Im perial Navy, effected, under the direction of Prof. W. V. Struve, the degree measurement of Liefland along the meridian of Dorpat. This measurement served to connect the measurements formerly made along the same meridian south of Hochland by Professor Struve, and with measurements made about 1827 by Mr. Pauker, director of the observatory at Mitau, north of Jacob stadt. In 1830 the degree measurement of Liefland was connected with a sim ilar measurement of Lithuania, which had been just completed by Tenner. Tn 1832 was completed a connected series of triangulations which was commenced in 1820, and covers the governments of St. Petersburg, Novgo rod, Pleskor, and Witepsk Up to 1826 the field-work was done by the officers of the General Staff, and after that year exclusively by the officers of the Corps of Topographers. The probable error of observation for trian gles of the first class was 1\".05, and for those of the second class, 1\".82. The 1366 wh 24"], [378, "370 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. differences of the computed and measured lengths of the bases amounted to about 10io0o of the bases. In 1830, after the establishment of a permanent observatory at Reval, work was commenced on the Baltic triangulations projected in 1828 by General Schubert. This so-called Baltic triangulation was extended along the two shores of the Gulf of Finland and a part of the Gulf of Riga, and embraces astronomical determinations of many points. In 1835 a series of triangles was laid across the islands of Alend for the purpose of establishing a connection with the Swedish triangulations near Stockholm. This triangulation is also connected with Struve's degree measurement near Hochland, and in many points, with the triangulations of St. Petersburg, and at Pernov with the triangulations of Liefland. The observatory at Reval was taken as the starting point of the co-ordinates. In 1826 the French Government proposed to the Russian Government to participate in a degree measurement of the 48th north parallel, by a contin uation of the work of the French, Bavarian, and Austrian engineers from Chernovitz in Bukovina to the river Volga, or even to the Ural, so as to obtain the measurement of an arc of 48 degrees in longitude, of which 18 degrees would constitute the Russian portion. Although the proposal was taken into serious consideration, and even instruments for the carrying of the plan into effect were ordered from abroad by the Russian Government, the execution of the plan was abandoned in 1830 on account of the political complications of the times. Much initial and comparison astronomical work was accomplished during the 10 years intervening between the establishment and first reor ganization ofthe corps (1822-1832). These observations were connected with the triangulation of Wilna, Kurland, Liefland, St. Petersburg, Novgorod, Pleskov (Pskov), and in part Witebsk. During the same period, a number of points in European Turkey, Asia Minor, and in the Caucasus were astronomically determined. The year 1819 was the starting point of a series of regular topographic surveys of all the governments of Russia, commencing with those along the western border. ' With a view to insuring uniformity of cartographic"], [379, "371 RUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. work, detailed instructions were issued in 1822 from the office of the Quar termaster-General, prescribing the conventional signs to be used in topo graphical, geographical, and route maps and military plans. These signs were in many respects, such as colors and rendition of details, similar to those used at the present time. The surveys of that period may be sub divided, according to degree of accuracy, into 4 groups: topographical in strumental, topographical semi-instrumental, ocular surveys, and recon naissances. The topographical instrumental surveys were those of the governments of Wilna, St. Petersburg, Grodno, and part of Kiev. The surveys of Wilna and Kiev were made at the scale of 1 inch = 12,200 square feet, and those of St. Petersburg and Grodno at the scale of 1 inch = 9,800 square feet to the square inch. The number of sheets representing these surveys are as follows: Wilna, 658. St. Petersburg, 526. Grodno, 224. Kiev, 50. The semi-ocular surveys ofthe period (1822-1832) were those of the governments of Minsk, Bessarabia, the Military Colonies, the Province of Orenburg, New Finland, and surveys in Western Siberia. The scales of these surveys vary from 1 inch = 4,900 square feet (military colonies) to 1 : 168,000. The plane-table sheets are colored, and the mountains are drawn according to Lehman's system. The ocular surveys of the period (1822-1832) embrace portions of Moldavia, Wallachia, Bulgaria, Trans-Caucasia, Kurland, and Novgorod The reconnaissances cover the then accessible regions between the Caspian and Ural seas, and were made by means of compass and odometer on a scale of about 1 inch to 10 miles The most important cartographic work of that period is the composition and printing of the so-called 100-sheet map (scale 1:840,000), of which 98 sheets were finished in 1814, and 16 more sheets, embracing the Kingdom of Poland, were finished in 1816. The next prominent cartographic work was the commencement in 1 82 1 of the composition of the special map (Schubert's) on a scale of 1:420,000 and according to the projection of"], [380, "372 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS.

Among the other cartographic works of the time may be mentioned: (a) topographical map of Moscow with surroundings, 4 sheets; (b) postal map of Russia, 12 sheets; (c) map of the theater of the war in Asia, 4 sheets, scale 1:840,000; (_.) map of the theater of war in European Turkey, 7 sheets, scale 1:420,000. Of the minor works, the following deserve particular mention: (1) map of Krasnoe-Selo and surroundings, 6 sheets, scale 1 : 840,000; (2) plan of the surroundings of Constantinople from ocular survey in 1827, 4 sheets, 1 inch to 2 versts; (3) postal map of European Russia, 12 sheets, 1 inch to 70 versts; (4) detailed plan of St. Petersburg, 24 sheets; the engraving of this plan is remarkable for its artistic execution ; the cost was 4,000 rubles ; and (5) military route map of a- portion of Russia and the neighboring countries, 8 sheets, scale 1 : 1,680,000. In 1832, the Corps of Military Topographers was put under the imme diate command of the Quartermaster-General of the General Staff. The office of director of the corps was abolished. The force of the corps was fixed at 70 officers and 456 topographers, divided into three companies, designated by numbers. The topographers were, besides, divided into three classes, according to proficiency. The promotion of topographers to the grade of officers remained as be fore. In the absence of vacancies in the corps, the topographers of the first class having served 12 years, and passed the necessary examination, were promoted to second lieutenant in the army. Those who could not pass the examination were promoted to third lieutenants in the army. The first company was designated by the name of Topographical Company of the Military Topographical Depot. Thus the school of military topograph ers received an entirely military organization. During the period comprised between the year 1832 (first reorganiza tion of the corps of military topographers) and 1867 (its last reorganization) a considerable amount of topographical and astronomical work was accom plished."], [381, "373 RUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. In 1849, a committee under the chairmanship of the Quartermaster- General of the General Staff, and composed of several superior officers of the staff, the director of the Military Topographical Depot, the consulting astronomer of that depot, 0. W. Struve, the director of the Observatory of Pulkova, Academician W. Struve, and Professor of Geodesy Colonel Bo lotov, upon an examination of the various improvements accomplished up to that time in the art of topography, decided and ordered that the method of rectangular spheroidal co-ordinates heretofore in use should be aban doned, that the plane-table sheet should be prepared according to the method of Muffling, and that preference should be given to the projection of Hauss, recourse being had to the projection of Bonne only in particular cases. Between the years 1832 and and 1867 several expeditions for geo graphical purposes were undertaken as well by officers of the General Staff and Topographic Corps as by officers of the Navy and members of the Academy of Sciences, under the auspices of the General Staff. These expeditions resulted in an accumulation of valuable material for future topographical work Astronomical determinations have been obtained of several points along the eastern shore of the Black Sea, of Western Siberia, of Asia Minor, of Persia, of Khiva, of the shores of the Caspian Sea, of the Kirgis Steppes, along the rivers of middle Asiatic countries, along the Russo- Chinese frontier and the western coast of the Japanese Sea. All the topographic surveys undertaken between 1832 and 1844, were distinguished from the preceding surveys by the uniformity of the scale adopted therefor, viz: 1 inch =9,800 square feet, and a more nearly equi lateral series of triangles.

The first survey made on that scale was the survey that scale was the survey of the government of Witebsk. The topographic work was considerably expedited and cheapened, as shown by the following table: Among the ocular surveys of the third period (1832-1867) may be mentioned those of the Kingdom of Poland, New Finland, and the navy- timber forests; also surveys for the delimitation of the frontiers between Russia and Turkey and Persia. In 1853, by agreement between the General Staff and the Ministry of Government Lands, a common system of conventional signs was adopted for both the military topographic surveys and the surveys of the corps of civil surveyors under this ministry. The most essential modification intro duced thereby in the military charts consisted in the designation of wooded spaces by color. Since 1860, however, the improvements made in the photographic processes led to a rejection of colors and to a radical change in the methods of finishing charts by means of the pen. Name of region.

Reconnaissances of a number of districts previously surveyed were made between the years 1863 and 1867, which resulted in some additions to and omissions from the details of the surveys. In 1835, from ocular surveys, march routes, and information obtained from military prisoners, a map was composed of the northern inclines of the Caucasus on a scale of 1:840,000. Since that time, up to 1852, the topo graphic work done at various times is represented by instrumental surveys covering about 3,537 square versts, semi-instrumental surveys, 3,400 square versts, and ocular surveys and reconnaissances of about 2,200 square versts. Towards 1856 an area of 15,771 square versts was surveyed instrumentally and semi-instrumentally at the Caucasus and in Asiatic Turkey. After the final conquest of the Caucasus, in 1859, a great number of instrumental surveys of various districts of the Caucasus were completed and the mate rial accumulated was found sufficient to warrant the commencement of a new route map of the Caucasus on a scale of 1:840,000. At the same time the trigonometric levelings beyond the Caucasus led to the determin ation of the difference between the levels of the Black and Caspian seas. The most important cartographic work of the period comprised be tween 1846 and 1867 was undoubtedly the engraving of plates for the re production, on the scale 1:126,000, of the topographic maps of the various governments, 30 in number, surveyed during that period. A number of atlases and special maps of various regions were published for general use and put on sale. The prices at which the publications of the Topo graphical Depot are sold are calculated to exactly cover the expense of publication. Among the special publications of that period may be men tioned: (a) the Atlas of Volga, 15 sheets, scale 15 square versts to the square inch, price 75 kopecks; (b) general map of land, water, and telegraphic com munications of European Russia, 4 sheets, 80 square versts to the square inch, price 2 rubles ; (c) general map of Western Siberia and the Kirgis Steppe, 50 versts to the square inch, 4 sheets, price 2 rubles; (d) general map of Orenburg and portions of Khiva and Bukhara, 2 sheets, 50 versts to the inch, price 1^ rubles; (e) map of Central Asia, 100 versts to the inch, 4 sheets, price 2 rubles."], [384, "376 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The decree of December 24, 1866, fixes- the personnel of the Corps of Topographers as follows: 6 generals, 33 superior officers, 156 subaltern offi cers, 170 topographers of civil rank, 236 topographers of the rank of cor porals, and 42 apprentices. The decree appropriates 124,000 rubles annu ally for topographic, geodetic, and astronomic work in European Russia, and 46,000 rubles annually for the edition of maps. It raises the table of the compensations of the personnel of the corps and considerably increases the allowances for traveling expenses and the additional compensations of topographers detailed for work in remote regions. The 170 ranked topog raphers were subdivided into 4 classes corresponding to the ranks 14-12, 10-9, and 8-7 of the civil service, with compensations at the rates of 300, 360, and 480 rubles per annum, respectivel}-'. The annual compensation of the corporals is fixed at 180 rubles, and that of the apprentices at 120 rubles. The Military Topographic School was put on the same footing as other military schools. The number of professors was considerably increased and the curriculum of studies enlarged. The field exercises of the students were made the object of special detailed instructions. Entirely exact surveys were first initiated in 1870 in Finland and Bessa rabia. The substance of the new method adopted since 1870 consists in the use of a greater number of points with accurately determined eleva tions for a more reliable representation of the inequalities of the surface by means of horizontals. The measurement of distances by means of the chain being permitted only in exceptional cases. The relief on the field draughts is permanently shown by horizontals. These plats serve for the compila tion of all the detailed maps. On the maps at a reduced scale the reliefs are expressed in short hachures with the assistance of accurately delineated horizontals. Then photography and new improved methods of photo engraving furnish excellent and cheap means for further reduction of these plans and the engraving of the maps on any desired scale. The cost of the field-work of these surveys is estimated by the director in 1885 at 29.5 rubles per square mile (approximately* $22.78 per square mile). * One ruble taken at 77 cents."], [385, "377 RUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGR A PHIC. The results of the surveys made since 1867 are shown in the following table : According to the table of 1867, the cartographic establishment consisted of 4 divisions, viz: the (a) Draughting division, with two sections attached, viz: bindery and water painting. (b) Division of engraving. (c) Division of printing (copper-plate and lithography). (d) Division of photography. The number of officers detailed for draughting remains the same as in 1863, viz, 40. These forty officers give occupation to some 55 engravers. In the other technical branches of the cartographic establishment a slight reduction of the force was effected by the reorganization of 1867. Of all tbe cartographic works of the modern period, the new special map of European Russia (1:420,000) indisputably occupies the first place. It is an immense edition on 152 sheets, representing an area considerably greater than one-half of all Europe. The second place among the cartographic works of the establishment belongs to the composition, engraving, and printing now in progress of the military topographic map (1 : 126,000). The most recent works are the maps now being prepared (1872) of the Kingdom of Poland, of the government of Pleskov, and a portion of the government of Novgorod. These later publications undoubtedly testify to considerable progress in the art of engraving and printing accomplished by the military cartographic establishment.

Lithographic, and particularly chromolithographic, printing has reached considerable development. This printing is applied in Russia not only for engraving executed on stone, but also to maps engraved on copper. The art of transfer from copper is rapidly progressing under the lead of the superintendent of the printing branch. The development of chromolithography led, naturally, to the increase in the number of copies of modern editions. The artistic merits of the printing done by the Russian Military Topographic Division is recognized by other departments of the Government and private individuals and out side orders for printing are frequently received by the Division.

Much of the trigonometric work in Russia has been of the first class, and great geodetic works such as Struve's arc of the meridian from the Danube to the North Sea, and Russia's share of the great arc of parallel from Valentia, Ireland, to the Ural region, Russia, have been executed, but until later years, detailed topographic operations, of the primal order of accuracy, do not appear to have been carried on over large areas. Two or three trigonometric points are finally found for each plane table sheet (1:21,000), and these become centers for detailed geometric con nections.

BALKAN PENINSULA. [Survey of the Russian Campaign of 1877, 1878, 1879.] Prior to the beginning of the war in 1877 the astronomic determina tions and topographic surveys, executed from 1828-33 by Russian sur veyors (geometers) and topographers, were the only available material, bearing upon the cartography of Turkey, except the works of the Austrian General Staff in 1873-77. These surveys were all based on astronomic points, which again were connected by triangulation, as far as obstacles of carrying the trigonometric extension into the enemy's' country would permit. Differential longitudes were obtained by lunar culminations, signals by means of powder flashes and chronometer observations, hence the results were only adequate to the primitive methods employed. However, during a period of 4*. years, Moldavia, Wallachia, and parts of Northern and Western Bulgaria, aggre-"], [389, "RUSSIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 381 gating 166,000 square versts (approximately 72,875 square miles), were sur veyed at the scales of 1:42,000 and 1:84,000. This work being carried on simultaneously with the operations of warfare, is naturally somewhat imperfect. The war of 1877 necessitated, therefore, the preparation of maps of the theater of operations. With this end in view a Military Topograjjhical Division, consisting of 1 chief and 16 officers, was attached to the staff of each army corps. The topographic operations of 1877 were limited to the narrow field then occupied, especially on account of the winter season. Succeeding events, however, enabled the topographers to extend their sur veys over the greater part of the peninsula. During the entire campaign the area of the Bulgarian and Eastern Roumelian principalities was covered by triangulation, likewise portions of Turkish territory, connecting Jamboli and Mustapha Pasha with Adrianople and via Tchorlu with Constantinople as well as Kirkilissa with Burgas. About 100 points were determined in Roumania, and in Servia the triangulation work was considerably extended. In carrying the triangulation from the Black Sea across the Balkans, 8 chains of triangles were established and connected with each other; in fact, the trigonometric points were in close proximity and hardly more than 25 versts apart, the total number of stations thus established aggregating 1,285, while with few exceptions altitude determinations of all these points were obtained. The astronomic work confined its functions to determinations of points within the boundaries of Bulgaria, Roumelia, and Roumania. For differ ences of longitude telegraphic signals were employed so far as circumstances would permit, and thus 51 points were astronomically established (37 tele graphically and 14 chronometrically). The minimum probable error was 0?2 seconds (in time) for the first class, and 0.1 second (in time) for the second. The latitudes were determined with high precision, and with a probable error not exceeding 0\".2 in arc. The difference of longitude between Odessa and Constantinople was determined telegraphically. The operations in Eastern Bulgaria, under the direction of Captain Schmidt (1878-79), cover an area of 36,790 square versts, not including"], [390, "382 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. reconnaissances embracing 5,000 square versts, in the \"Dobroudsha\" embrac ing 13,600 square versts; in the latter province 93 triangulation stations were established. The survey of Western Bulgaria was partly made on scales of 1:84,000 and 1 : 42,000, with equidistant horizontals of 5 fathoms (35 feet), which was carried to within 20 versts of Constantinople. The Bulgarian surveys sum up as follows: Square verst-. At the scale of 1: 42,000, instrum en tally 97,400 At the scale of 1 : 42,000, partly instrumental 13, 150 At the scale of 1:84,000, instrumentally 9,750 At the scale of 1 : 84,000, reconnaissance 13, 450 Total 133,750 or, approximately, 58,715 square miles* It may be mentioned that altitude determinations of points average one to every square verst. These surveys have clearly proven that all existing maps of these countries previously made were incorrect and valueless. The material col lected with so much labor and exertion for an accurate representation of the relief and natural outline of this territory will not become obsolete for a long period. There was received in 1883 from the Ministry of War, at Sofia, Bulgaria, a small index map (in Russian) of a series of sheets numbering 67 (scale 1:126, 000), wliich embrace Bulgaria, Eastern Roumelia, and a part of Eastern Tur key, including Constantinople. This index map was prepared at the Topo graphic Bureau at St. Petersburg, and it is assumed that it is the outgrowth of the surveys in the Balkan Peninsula above described. This map was to have been issued and published in 1884, in black and two colors (one for the mountains, represented by contours at 10 sagenes, or 70 feet, interval, -and another for the forests). These sheets, constructed at scale 1:105,000, were to have been photographically reduced to scale 1:126,000 and produced by heliogravure. * One verst = 0.6629 English mile ; 1 square verst = 0.4304 English square mile."], [391, "383 RUSSIA\u2014 GEOLOGIC.

For this purpose a yearly appropriation of 15,000 francs (approximately $3,000) for ten years, commencing with January 1, 1876, was set aside. The personnel of the force making the geological examination of Finland (Finlands Geologiska Undersokning) is under the immediate control of the Administration of Mines, and consists of a director and a number of assist ants, appointed annually. The total number of the latter since 1877 under the same director (Moberg) has been 19 in all, averaging 6 annually, selected from the students of the University and the Polytechnic Institute, as well as from employes of the Department of Mines. In 1882 the per sonnel consisted of as follows : (1) Director (Prof. K. Adolph Moberg, since 1877) ; (2) 3 geologists; (3) 1 mining engineer ; (4) 1 cartographer and surveyor ; (5) 2 temporary assistants, for field-work only (pupils of tlie Polytechnic Institute). The director receives a fixed salary of 3,000 francs (approximately $600) in addition to his pay (3,300 francs, approximately $660), as an officer in the Administration of Mines ; the annual salaries of the assistants vary from 1,000 to 4,000 francs ($200 to $800) while those serving afield season only receive 600 francs, and all receiving free transportation to and from and"], [393, "FINLAND\u2014 GEOLOGIC. 385 subsistence while in the field. The instructions for the geological explora tions are determined by the approval and confirmation of the Senate. The working maps of the geologists furnished by the Administration of Mines are prepared by the Geodetic Land Survey and the Topographical Corps on a scale of 1 : 100,000. The insft-uments used in the geological investigation are compasses, levels, thermometers, hammers, and small boring apparatuses. In different localities, especially where large swamp and clay deposits are found,* in addition to ordinary surface borings others are carried often as far as 50 feet. The explanatory test for each atlas sheet embraces results from the chemical and microscopic analyses of rocks and soils thus collected. Field work is carried on from June to October; maps and reports are prepared by the geologists duringthe wintermonths. Althoughall possible accuracy from actually traversing the area is required, too great minuteness is to be avoided. Contemporaneously with the geological explo ration in the field the determination of heights of prominent points is carried on, and the resulting elevation entered on the chart and bench-marks cut on mountain walls and large rocks. The compilation of the geological data from the working maps of the geologists is intrusted to the cartographer, who reduces them during the winter to the prescribed scale of 1:200,000, each sheet (scale 1:200,000) embracing approximately 2,635.6 square kilometers. The amount examined for each geologist has averaged 114 square kilometers a month. The finished sheets, accompanied by a report compiled by the director from data furnished by the geologists, is forwarded to the Administration of Mines (usually in May), on whose request the Imperial Senate sanctions their publication, which is done, and made ready for distribution duringthe following summer at the lithographic establishment of the General Staff at Stockholm. A single complete atlas sheet is here after to be assigned each geologist. Since 1879 five maps, with descriptive text, have been issued, and two others are in course of preparation. During 1883 the examination of Wyland will have been completed and an addi tional area of 3,660 square kilometers will have been explored. Map No. 1, \" Suomenmaan Geologillinen Tutkimus\", is one ofthe regular atlas sheets on the scale of 1:200,000, and shows the general character of the explora tion carried on, giving the result of three years' operations with reference to 1366 wh 25"], [394, "386 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. i the geognostic relations, minerals, soils, &c. The remaining sheets, of which six more, comprising the geology of the vicinity of Helsingfors and Hango, have been issued, are similar, indicating the results of the several years. All the superficial deposits, including the great glacial drift, are shown; and the very deep fiords about Helsingfors, give to the sheets of that region, a very complicated appearance, from the singular combination of colors in spots. It is estimated that with the present personnel it will require 67 years to complete the survey, but such an estimate involves too many indeterminable factors, as character of the country, number of points of great economic importance, &c, to possess much if any significance. It is not yet determined that the scale of 1 : 200,000 will be used for the more northern sections; a smaller scale, say, 1:400,000, being probable. The expense of carrying on the work to 1882 was 93,602 francs; an annual average of 18,900 francs, or approximately $3,780. The expenditures have since slightly increased, owing to the necessity of increasing the pay of geologists, in order to secure their services more permanently, thus preventing fre quent changes hitherto made. The explanations on each sheet of the geological map are given in Fin nish and Swedish; but the descriptions in every instance (Beskrifuing) are in Swedish only. BELGIUM. Topographic. The Topographic Survey of Belgium (reproduced on scales of 1 : 40,000, in 72 sheets, and 1:20,000, in 430 sheets,) is carried on by the Military Car tographic Institute of the War Department at Brussels.* The area of Belgium is approximately 11,375 square miles, with a pop ulation in 1882 of 5,655,197, or an average of 497 to the square mile; the largest of any one country in Europe, except Saxony, one of the states of the present German Empire. This Institute is a branch of the General Staff, and now under the direction of Major Hennequin, of the General Staff. * In 1878 the topographic and cartographic services of the \" Depdt de la Guerre,\" received the title of Military Cartographic Institute."], [395, "BELGIUM\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 387 The per sonnelin August, 1885, was asfollows: Two superior officers, 1 the director and 1 the chief of the topographic brigade, 30 captains and lieu tenants, of whom 9 are topographers, 7 officers for the plane-table surveys of fortified places, 2 for geodesy, 3 for the works scale 1:160,000 and the mobilization maps, 5 for the maps at 1 : 40,000 and 1 : 20,000, 2 for statistical and geological maps, 1, a photographer, and 1, an officer for the instrument office and Bureau service. There were also forty-six civil employes, as fol lows : 1 secretary accountant, 13 engravers, 11 lithographers, 10 draughts men, and 11 printers or printing employes. As well there were 72 subofficers, corporals and soldiers, of whom 20 are draughtsmen, copyists or storekeepers, 7 messengers, and 45 soldiers for the service of the Bureau, of the ateliers and the printing office, making 150 in all. The above number is now somewhat less than heretofore. There has been established since January 1, 1883, a section of draughtsmen (subaltern officers) which has resulted in a saving in the cost of map revision and the introduction of a number of improvements especially advantageous as to the detailed maps more particularly required for current army needs. The personnel of the reproduction branch consists of an ordinary draughtsman, 1 lithographic draughtsman, engravers, a photographer, and printers. CIVIL DIVISIONS. Belgium is divided into 9 provinces (administrative), subdivided into arrondissements (administrative and judicial), again into canton* (military and judicial), and finally into 2,582 communes. MILITARY DIVISIONS. There are 2 military districts (Lieutenant-General). Each of the 9 provinces also constitutes a military command (Major-General). The French metric system is used, the \" aune\" being equivalent to the meter. Geodetic operations in Belgium date from 1844, and were first executed at the request of the French Government, in order to place the map of the battle-field of Ramillies in the Historical Atlas of the War of Succession in Spain. 9"], [396, "388 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Triangulation of the field of Waterloo for a map, scale 1:20,000, com menced in 1847. Political events of 1848 retarded geodetic work, which was, however, resumed in 1850. There are two main base lines for the entire territory. Astronomic observations are adjunctive to the main tri angulation, and levels of precision are employed. The initial astronomic determinations, upon which the triangulation rests, were made by Mr. J. C. Houzeau, member of the Royal Academy, assisted by the late Col. Adan (then a lieutenant of the General Staff). This work, however, formed a part and was immediately under the direction ofthe \"Depot de la Guerre\" under the late General Nerenburger. The triangulation has been joined to that of the surrounding countries (see \" Precis historique des operations geodesiques et astronomiques faites en Hollande, pour servir de base a la topographie de cet Etat\"). The errors do not exceed those admitted in all main triangulations. The origin of o <_\u25a0 geodetic co-ordinates is the east tower of St. Joseph's Church at Brussels. The field-work of triangulation was completed in 1873. A special triangu lation for detailed map of Brussels (1: 2,500) was commenced in 1874, the main triangulation revised in 1875, and the final computations completed two years later. The basis for the map has been \u2014 1. Data furnished by the geodetic branch, consisting of trigonometrically deter mined points. 2. Reduction of cadastral surveys of the several communes to the scale of 1 : 20,000. 3. The lines and situation of the bench-marks of the general leveling. Each sheet (scale 1 : 20,000) is 8,000 meters in length by 10,000 meters in width, or 8,000 hectares, 8 of which compose 1 sheet of scale of 1:40,000. There are from 5 to 7 geodetic points for each plane-table sheet (scale 1:20,000). The cadastral charts have been usually prepared at pretty large scales, the minimum being 1:2,500. These were reduced (1847 to 1855) to 1: 20,000 for a planimetric base. The cadastre of each commune is divided into sections, called \"plans parcellaires,\" and ' designated A, B, C, D, &c. . The different sheets are"], [397, "BELGIUM\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 389 reduced and collected in one general plan for the entire commune, of which five copies are produced. The leveling has been both general and special, the former being levels of precision along main lines covering the entire country and as a base work for the special leveling required for the plane-table sheets. The general or main bench-marks are chosen for their greater or less stability, as mile-stones, bridge tablets, also points on viaducts and aque ducts, sills of churches, chapels, communal or school houses, public houses, or, in default of any of these, private houses solidly constructed. Ordinary bench-marks were established on all roads or avenues of communication 1 kilometer apart. The results for each plane-table sheet are from 15 to 25 of these points, a list of which accompanied by a descriptive sketch is then given to the topographer. These levels are referred to ordinary low water, the mean of low wrater having been found to be 2,135.5 meters below a point assumed as mean sea level, established by means of a canal lock at Ostend. A revision of all main lines of level was made by distributing the error according to the method of least squares. It has been the custom to place 32 of the plane-table sheets on one large table, within which the trigonometric points were projected, assuming the rectangular lines of the borders as co-ordinate axes. The detail of the cadastral plats is then adjusted to the trigonometric points. Each one of the sheets, 0.50 by 0.40 meter, is then placed in the hands of the topographer. The resulting detail is transferred to the plane table sheet by a reverse tracing. This planimetry is drawn in pale india ink. In addition, the list of levels is placed in the hands of the topographical engineer, who- is a lieutenant. The latter are taken from the older pupils of the Military School, twelve or fifteen of these officers, under a captain, form a brigade of the Etat-Major. The duties of this brigade are\u2014 1.

To determine by the eclimeter adapted to the compass a great number of neighboringpoints, for showing the figure of the ground with exactness by equidis tant level curves (at least 3,000 for 8,000 hectares). 4. To delineate the ground by means of level curves traced lightly in crayon after the presumable calculation of the points. 5. To take note of occurrences of al] sorts which the ground presents. The level-work is the most important, and the instruments are chosen accordingly. The field season begins in April and lasts approximately six months. The defective linear work is perfected and omissions supplied. The objects claiming special attention are \u2014 Watercourses, communications of all sorts, houses, gardens, hedges, chapels, ditches and isolated crosses, bridges, wells, boundaries, toll-gates, &c. The curves are carried to a distance of 50 meters beyond the limits of each plane-table sheet for the purpose of facilitating the connection with adjacent sheets. Curves are drawn at distances of 1 meter, with more care for those 5 meters apart. The plane-table sheets are inked only after reaching the Brussels office, and two months' field-work is required for each sheet. These sheets, having from 4,000 to 5,000 level-points, executed with great care, are reduced by photography to scale 1:40,000. These plane table sheets have proceeded in regular fashion since 1859, and were all completed in 1873. The map (scale 1:40,000) is constructed after the Flamsteed modified projection, the origin of co-ordinates being the inter section of the meridian of the Royal Observatory at Brussels and the 56th parallel north latitude. The map is engraved on stone, and curves drawn 5 meters apart. The sheets (1 : 20,000) are published in chromolithography, commenc ing in 1866 and ending in 1880. When joined they will form a rectangle of 13 by 14 meters. Fifty of the sheets (1:40,000) had been revised (1879) for all changes.

The engraving of this map, on stone, commenced in 1861, and was com pleted in December, 1883; the number of levels upon whfoh the reliefs were based exceeding 1,000,000. At this date the annual appropriation for the service was 100,000 francs, approximately $20,000. This map is found to be of the greatest service to the army, industry, commerce, and agriculture; nevertheless it has been admitted that that upon the scale of 1:20,000 is of greater value. Equidistant contours of 5 feet were found too great for the plains of the Meuse. It appears that all the administrative branches avail themselves of the large scale, finding thereon information not elsewhere accessible, and which could only be attained independently at very great cost, and then only in ah incomplete form. Forty of the above sheets had been revised for paved roads in 1885. Where revisionary topographic work has been done, the revision includes, in addition to means of communication, all details of construction and culti vation.

This edition has, however, been interrupted, and is replaced temporarily by the publi cation of sheets of the first edition revised to embrace paved roads. It (the second edition in colors) will soon, however, be resumed.

The property of gelatine in contact with the salt of chrome, becoming insoluble under the action of light, has been variously utilized, thus afford ing photographic carbon prints, by the processes known as Woodbury type, heliotype, heliogravure, photozincography, and photolithography. The principal conditions for success appear to be (1) to obtain a brilliant negative, presenting sufficient contrasf between the transparent and opaque parts, and (2) to establish a perfect connection between the negative and the printing surface in case of direct transfer, or first with the transfer film, in case one is introduced. All of these processes have been experimented with at the Belgian Military Institute, as well as a new method called \"gravure heliogalvanique,\" being a combination of galvanoplastic and pho tography which, it is claimed, gives an engraving on copper almost as fine as handwork at about one hundredth part the cost. The map (scale 1 : 40,000) is engraved on stone, as also that of field of Waterloo, those (scale 1:20,000) by photolithography, photozincography, and chromolithography."], [402, "394 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. There is also being irregularly reproduced, as required, by photographic enlargement from the plane-table sheets, scale 1:20,000, a map of parts of Belgium (by photozincography) in sheets a quarter size at 1 : 10,000.

It mcludes the exact condition of all means of communication up to July 1, 1884. This map also contains the revision of all water courses and new works of fortification, but forests and prairies remain as shown on map of same scale engraved in 1859, and from which many editions had been printed both in black and colors. There is soon to be commenced a generalized topographic map, scale 1:200,000 (to replace map 1:160,000), derived from a reduction of the sheets (1:40,000), thus eliminating any errors of position inherent to the map of 1859. The new map will be reproduced by heliogravure. At the close of season of 1885, the field topographic revision will have embraced 1,719,327 hectares, or about ~ of the whole area of Belgium stated at 2,945,715 hectares, equivalent to 11,373.7 square miles. Commencing in 1879, each season's revisionary operations embraced about 320,000 hectares (40 sheets of 8,000 hectares each), at which rate it should be completed in 1889 or 1890. Each topographical officer is expected to make (except in particularly complicated ground) the complete revision of a plane-table sheet in one month. This revisionary work at scales 1:40,000 and 1:20,000, it is intended shall in the most rapid and useful manner be made available to the public. The funds annually available for the expenses of the Institute are an appro priation of 176,000 francs (10,000 francs less than in 1883) and about 15,000 francs realized from the sale of maps.

It will be noticed that the principal part of the present annual cost is for current work on various maps and for printing. The expense for salaries, pay, &c, of all military officers and men detached for duty at the Institute are carried under another heading in the military budget. But, inasmuch as these officers and men are not replaced in the corps from which they are detached, where they may immediately return for duty in case of necessity, their cost to the state (about 141,000 francs annually) is not reckoned in the total expense of the Great General Survey. According to \"notice, sur les cartes agricoles \" (pp. 64 and 65), by Major Hennequin, the total cost to the public treasury 'for all kinds of works by the \"Depot de la Guerre\" and the present Institute from 1832 to December 31, 1883, had been 4,507,442 francs, or a little more than 1.50 franc per hectare (approximately $79.25 per square mile). This cal culation, brought forward to December 31, 1884, gives a total cost to that date, from special appropriations and receipts from sales, of 4,837,341.49 francs. The cost of the topographic field revision is stated at 45 francs per square kilometer (approximately $23.31 per square mile). It has been estimated lately in Belgium that the total cost to the Gov- ernment for this work as a whole (including all expenses for military officers and men) has not been far from 10,000,000 francs (approximately $175.82 per square mile). The Director of the Institute very properly maintains that the expense of the changeable military force is not properly charge able, and also states that the above sum even, including the latter charge, is in excess of the true and actual cost to the Government. The total cost of engraving on stone the 72 sheets (scale 1:40,000) was found to be approximately 663,000 francs. This shows an average of 3.60"], [404, "396 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. francs per square centimeter ($4.75 per square inch), which is believed to be below rather than above the actual cost* Equidistant horizontal curves, adopted at the commencement of the map series, 1:40,000 and 1:20,000, are still employed to represent elevations. For the first time (1885) the sheets (1 : 40,000), conjoined into a single map, figure at the Exposition at Antwerp, and it is stated by the Director that the method of curves for representing reliefs is very satisfactory for a country like Belgium. During 1884, modifications have been admitted in the execution ofthe map 1 : 160,000, by retaining the level curves, and adding lithographic crayon shading (oblique light), to the intervening spaces, to accentuate the form of the terrain as a whole. This resembles the crayon shading employed on the Norwegian maps (1 : 100,000) the latter, however, using hypothetically direct light. The Eckstein chromolithographic process has been employed in the reproduction of diagrammatic charts in the work on agricultural sta tistics. This process is also being experimented with for maps proper. Experiments are now being made to replace the transfers on stone with a heliographic transfer on zinc, with good results for the map, 1 : 20,000, both in black and colors. The possibility of effecting with clearness and facility corrections upon the engraved stone has been established. Volume II of the calculations of the triangulation of the Kingdom is about to issue from the press. The issue of special maps of the vicinity of fortifications and fortified places, is restricted to the needs of the special military services entitled to them.

The present work began in 1878, and should be completed in 1894. Each geological system of rocks in its entirety is traced over its whole extent in Belgium by a single observer. It is called the \" monographic system,\" and is a very important innovation, which ought and doubtless will be followed by all other geological works, not covering too wide an extent. There are 5 geologists appointed by the Minister of the Interior, upon the recommendation of the director, also 1 petrographer, 1 assistant in the chemical laboratory, and 4 or 5 paleontologists. The field season is usually limited to 100 days, and all the professional work is done by the geologists, aided by the above-mentioned specialists, and 2 draughtsmen for delineating the colors. The present annual cost for field and office is 67,000 francs (approximately, $13,400), and it is estimated that the total cost for preparing, engraving, and printing in colors the 430 sheets will be 1,100,000 francs ($220,000, approximately), increased by 500,000 francs (approximately, $100,000), for the profiles and explanatory text. The basis of the cartographic illustrations are the plane-table sheets of the Military Topographical Survey (scale 1:20,000) and the same for the pur poses-of the field-work, when required, increased to a scale of 1:10,000. The map is prepared by superposing the colors and special geological conventional signs on the topographic base, already found constructed by the Military Cartographic Institute (see Belgium Topographic). The map is to appear in 72 main divisions, each containing when complete 8 sheets or \" planchettes.\" Six sheets have been issued (March, 1885). The outcrop of rocks is colored in full dark shades, and the soil, the alluvium or modern deposit, and all the quaternary formations are marked, and the linjits of each system, as obtained by digging and special borings, are indicated by a lighter shade called \" teinte neutre,\" of the color used for each \"e'tage\" or division. The map thus becomes a transcript of nature, a carefully made geological dress, well fitted to a substantially perfect topographic form, true at least for the surface, and more than usually correct for what lies hidden uriderneath. The soil as well as the subsoil being equally represented on the same sheet, signalizes a new departure in geological cartography. On each sheet explanations, sufficient to give an exact idea of all the formations contained within its limits, are printed on three sides. The"], [408, "400 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. upper part ofthe sheet has the title alone. The borings, executed to ascer tain the extent of the formations beneath the soil, reduce the suppositions to very narrow limits. Professor Marcou is of the opinion that no geological maps have yet been published in any country, where may be found so great an amount of accurate and valuable information with such clearnessand precision. The sheet of \"Dinant,\" issued in 1885, is pronounced a true \"chef d'\u0153uvre,\" and Professor Marcou claims as a certainty that it will become a model for geological maps. Mr Dupont, in introducing the monographic method (.. e , the study of each system or formation of rocks of a whole country without regard to its extent, though it embrace a continent, by a single geologist, or a special group of geologists trained and devoted to it exclusively, and the repre sentation both of the soil and subsoil on the same map) has introduced two of the most important innovations yet adopted since geological works began. Explanations of each sheet are published separately, and an important innovation has here been introduced, in placing in the text at their proper place, reduced colored sections, admirably executed Also, larger section views, like those employed by D. D. Owen, in 1852, in the geological explo ration of the Upper Mississippi, are placed at the end of each \"explica tion.\" These explanations are called the \"Stratigraphical series\" of the \"Musee Royal d'Histoire Naturelle de Belgique.\" Three other series exist, i. e., for Paleontology, existing Fauna, and Lithology. Finally a \" Bulletin\" is annually issued containing brief special memoirs. The maps are finely engraved and chromolithographed by a private firm in Leipzig (Messrs. Giesecke and Devrient), the publishers of the excellent geological map of Saxony. It was only after repeated trials, first at the \" Institut Cartographique Militaire,\" then in Paris, that Mr. Dupont, with the advice of a commission composed of cartographers from the \" Depot de la Guerre,\" geologists, and members of the Academy of Sciences of Belgium, selected and made a contract with the above large litliographic establishment. The topography is taken entirely from the original military plane-table sheets of the \"Institut Cartographique Militaire;\" and the com mission of control comprises General Brialmont, Chief of Engineers, the Secretary of War, &c."], [409, "401 BELGIUM\u2014 GEOLOGIC. In the spring of 1885, one-third of the field-work had already been completed. The following historical data is presented concerning this highly per fect geologic work. The first geological examination of Belgium, after the attempt of d'Omalius d'Halloy of the first French Empire, of which Belgium was then a part, was made by Andre Dumont from 1836 to 1854. He published in 1854 at the Imperial Printing Press at Paris, a general map under the title \"Carte Ge'ologique de la Belgique exe'cute'e par ordre du Gouvernement,' scale 1 : 160,000, in 9 sheets, and also the same map for only the under ground (sous-sol) under the title \" Carte Ge'ologique de la Belgique indi quant les terrains qui se trouvent au-dessous du limon Hesbeyen et du sable Camprinien,\" scale 1 : 160,000, in 9 sheets. Dumont published, also, a reduc tion of the above map in one sheet, under the title \" Carte Geologique de la Belgique et des contrees voisines,\" scale 1 : 380,00'). A second issue of these three maps was made in 1878 at the \"Depot de la Guerre.\" The scientific and artistic execution of these maps is remark able. They have attracted attention not alone from the originality of the classification employed, but also and more especially for the great number of colors, there being as many as 48 distinct tints. The second geological examination has already twice changed its organization and personnel. In 1878 the work was conducted by a committee of which Mr. Jochams, inspector-general of mines, was president. The \" Leve\" ge'ologique,\" or prac tical work in the field, was executed by the Baron O. van Ertborn, with 4 assistant volunteer geologists. This first organization published 21 sheets or \"planchettes\" (1 : 20,000) from 1879 to 1881. Then the work was made a part of the \" Musee Royal d'Histoire Naturelle,\" under the direction of Edward Dupont This second organization published six sheets from 1882 to 1883. Its highly important results have been above described. For some reason this work was suspended in May, 1885, and a third organiza tion is on the point of being made by the Belgian Government. 1366 WH 26"], [410, "402 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS.

DEMfAEK. Topographic. The Kingdom of Denmark has for a long time prosecuted systematic topographic surveys, on a trigonometric basis, under the Topographical Section of the General Staff branch of the War Department.

The oldest map of Denmark appears to have been executed about the middle of the sixteenth century, under Christian III, by the mathematician, Professor Jerdanns, and may be found in Braun's \"Theatrum Orbum.\" A hundred years then elapsed before any important topographic works were undertaken. By command of Christian IV, the Royal Mathematician, Johan Meyer, undertook the survey of the duchies Schleswig and Holstein, from 1638 to 1648, and already in 1652, 37 general and special maps appeared as a supplement to Caspar Dankwerth's description of the two above-named duchies then published. After this, Johan Meyer received a royal order to survey and map the Kingdom. This work was begun, but was suspended in 1658, presumably on account of the war with Sweden. From 1681 to 1687 there was under taken, under Christian V, as a basis for a new taxation, a survey and regis tration of the whole Kingdom, with the exception of the island of Born holm, under the direction of Jens Dinesen, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Copenhagen. In the royal instructions to the Registration Commission it was commanded that simultaneously with the survey and registration there should be prepared a map of the country, but only a beginning was made. The survey itself was completed in 1688, and is minutely described in Mandix's Handbook, &c. Under Christian V and Frederick IV, the Royal Map Director, Jens Sorenson, undertook a com plete sea and land chart, according to which, Husmann, in the beginning of the eighteenth century, probably prepared and published his map of Zea land and Fyn. Besides, under Frederick IV, the \" Rytter \" districts were sur veyed and mapped, and later Bornholm, Iceland, Jutland, and Holstein. The need for better and more connected surveys and maps caused the Royal Danish Scientific Society, established in 1742, finally, under Frederick V, to take the matter in hand, according to the suggestion of Peter Hofod, Professor of Mathematics at the Odense Gymnasium, in 1757, and decided that one bailiwick should be surveyed every year at royal expense. Its exe cution was put under the charge of Hofod, who worked at it indefatigably"], [412, "404 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. until his death in 1761, after which there was found a clearly drawn map of the bailiwick of Copenhagen and also rough draughts of the entire map. The Society now appointed a commission which should prepare a general plan for the geographical survey of Denmark (afterwards extending to include the Duchies). In accordance with this plan, wliich was approved by royal decree of June 26, 1761, the land should be surveyed on prin cipal parallel lines from which all objects should be determined ; the land survey map thus obtained should be tested and corrected by means of trigonometrical surveys and astronomical observations. The direction was intrusted to Counseller of Justice, Professor Hee, who should at once instruct the necessary surveyors, draw ,up the plan for each summer's survey and give his attention to the publication of the map. The survey began in 1762 with only 2 surveyors, but later on the number was increased. Thus the first triangulation of the country was made. Under the direction of Thomas Bugge, Professor of Astronomy, there was surveyed, in 1764, a base of 14,515 ells in length from Ting Hill to Brondby Hill, west of Copenhagen, which was completed in 1765, also a belt of triangles in the neighborhood of Copenhagen, which, in the follow ing year, were carried in different lines from Sjaeland over Fyn and Lange land to Halvren, and gradually at the end of the century they embraced the whole country from Skagen to the Elbe. (Besides this triangulation of the first order, there was made also one of the second order, on which churches, mills, and the like were marked, and also barometric measurements ) The necessary longitude, latitude, and azimuth determinations were made by Bugge in the year 1765* The detail measurement of the map was completed about 1820. It was undertaken on the scale of 1 : 20,000 and the maps were engraved and issued from time to time, from 1766 to 1834. From 1763 to 1781 appeared Pontoppidan's statistical topographical description of Denmark and Schleswig, under the name ofthe \"Danish Atlas,\" a work of great merit for its time. Shortly after the Scientific Society had set its surveys on foot, a plan was approved by the royal resolution of May 7, 1768, for the establishment of a new registration of the country, and as * The oldest reliable obser vatious of the longitude aud latitude of Copenhagen were made by the French Astronomer, Picard, in 1671, and Petro Horreboe in 1719."], [413, "405 DENMARK TOPOGRAPHIC. a basis for this, that there should be made a survey and map. This was begun in 1768 in the southern part of Zealand, but the work was stopped in 1772 in consequence of the royal decree of June 3, but was again begun in 1806 in accordance with the royal resolution of May 16, 1804, at the suggestion of the exchequer. There were employed 130 land inspectors and surveyors, and the work was to be completed in five or six years, but was prevented by the war of 1807. The field-work of the general regis tration ofthe Kingdom was completed in 1822. Before 1808 there are found but few traces of maps prepared for the special use ofthe army, and these are limited to the sketches drawn for the great maneuvers; such are found still of the environs of Copenhagen in 1802, of Rendsburg, 1800 and 1802, of Segeburg and Oldeshohe, 1804. By the royal resolution of January 20, 1808, the General Staff was established, divided into 2 sub-divisions, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General. The newly created General Staff perceived that the Scientific Society's maps, whose excellence however was acknowledged, could not be consid ered as sufficient for military requirements, as it was not undertaken with a view to military purposes, and besides that since the survey was begun in 1762 many changes had come to pass. The Staff determinated there fore to make a \"Military Geographical Map,\" and began in 1809 an inde pendent survey on the basis of the Scientific Society's original measure ments on the scale of 1:20,000. The fixed points of these were laid off on plane-tables, and on these points the military survey was based. The scale was also 1:20,000. In the beginning the surveying was done by the officers of the Staff only, but later other officers were also required. Before 1819 no preparations appear to have been made for the printing and issu ing of the military map. In that year there was begun the preparation of \"Maneuver and Road Maps,\" and also the reduction of a part of the envi rons of Copenhagen, on the scale of 1:60,000, but the Military Road Map No. 1 was not ready for publication before 1828, and did not represent reliefs. In 1822 a map of the whole of Zealand wTas begun by the Staff, but was not completed."], [414, "406 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. From 1807 to 1814 there were made special maps of the batteries and fortified places in the country and on the coast with their environs. At the close of 1830 the General Staff received orders to publish a \"Military Topographical Map of the entire country\" forming a connected whole. The survey was to rest on the Scientific Society's triangulation (from which organization in 1843 all map making was transferred to the General Staff), to be executed on the ground at 1 : 20,000, and to be published at the scale of 1 : 80,000, after the Lehmann system of relief representation. This work was commenced immediately, partly by Staff officers, and partly as before, by officers assigned to it, and for securing uniformity, rules and instructions for map drawing were issued under the name of \"Art of Topographical Drawing.\" The Topographical Map of Denmark should, according to the original plan, consist of 81 engraved sheets on the scale of 1 : 80,000, but after the war in 1864 the number of sheets was reduced to 66. In 1871, after 29 sheets had been published, embracing the islands (with the exception of Anhalt Laeso and Bornholm), it was decided that for the future the map of Jutland should be published at the scale of 1 : 40,000 (131 sheets, exclusive of Bornholm), and that the modified conical projection should be used instead of that hitherto employed, the \"Flamsteed modified.\" The map sheets for both maps have a rectangular form of 12 by 15 inches. The terrain is given with equidistant horizontal curves of 10 feet; but 4 sheets of Lealand, Falster, and the neighboring small islands have 5 feet equidistance, and the first 7 sheets were published without terrain representation, or hachures. In consideration of the great benefit to be derived from a map on the original scale of 1 : 20,000, the topographical section of the General Staff decided, in 1865, to publish such a map. Until 1861, when the General Staff began to make use of photography, it was very expensive for the public to obtain copies of the original survey sheets The only maps which had been engraved and published before that time on the original scales were \u2014 1. The plane-table sheet \" Vejrhoj\" proof-sheet, 1845. 2. The environs of Copenhagen in 6 large sheets, 1853-1857. 3. Hoje Moen in 2 sheets, 1854."], [415, "407 DENMARK\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. From 1861 to 1865 photographic copies of the sheets were drawn on transparent paper, which were accessible to the public as photographs. But real progress in that direction was made first after photographing by the camera was introduced in 1865, when photographs were made from 1866 to 1879, when photography was replaced by photozincography. Of the plane-table sheets of Jutland 500 had been issued in 1883. By degrees as time and opportunity permits the 125 plane-table sheets, which belong to the western group of islands, have been photolithographed and pho tozincographed; 47 had already been issued in 1882. In the same manner the eastern group of islands is to be issued in 284 plane-table sheets, but only after these have been corrected on the ground, and entirely new draw ings made, the present ones being more that twenty years old. The con formation of the ground is of course unchanged, but as in the first survey the woods wrere not leveled, this work must now be done. The present Topographic Atlas of the Kingdom of Denmark com prises two district groups of maps, viz: (a) Map of the Danish Islands to the east of the \" Little Belt,\" along with Samso and Thuno. (b) Maps of Jutland (Jy tland) aud the isle of Bornholm. The former map, of scale 1 : 80,000, is constructed after the modified Flamsteed projection. The controlling meridian is laid down at 2\u00b0 12' to the west of the old observatory at Copenhagen, and the tangent parallel is 56\u00b0 north latitude. The atlas consists of a title sheet and 29 sheets, each of which com prises a space of 20 Danish (438.16 English) square miles. . The map of Jutland and Bornholm, of scale 1 : 40,000, is constructed after the modified conical projection. This map, 69 sheets of which have been published, is to consist, when finished, of 131 sheets, comprising each a space of 5 Danish (109.54 English) square miles. This atlas is based upon a thorough trian gulation, for which the labors of the Danish degree measurement have latterly been availed of that afford belts of great triangles to which a sec ondary triangulation has been connected extending over the whole Kingdom, and on original levelings and measurements, scale 1 : 20,000, the ground"], [416, "408 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. being represented by means of equidistant horizontal curves of 5 Danish (5.15 English) feet. Every possible object that can serve as a fixed point for detailed meas urements is made use of, the whole map thus resting on thousands of points, the vertical co-ordinates of which are determined by trigonometric level ings. The origin of co-ordinates from which the latitude and longitude are computed is tlie center of the Observatory of Copenhagen (Round Tower), the latitude of which is 50\u00b0 40' 53\". The globular compression is assumed at Ath, and the length of a mean degree or 1.90 of a quadrant is taken at 57,000 toises The bottom of the sea also has been represented by a system of curves, the equidistance of which, however, is 6 (6.18 English) feet, and has been carried to the depth of 24 (24.71) feet only. Whenever the depth ofthe water is greater, certain soundings only have been indicated in fathoms. This part of the map is based on the hydrographic measurements of the Royal Danish Navy. The economic survey charts (scale 1 : 40,000) reduced by the pento graph, are made use of as a planimetric basis, where practicable. About 100 principal altitude points to the square mile are determined, while with a hand-level the additional number required as a basis for the 5-foot curves are observed for. The work in its detail is substantially ofthe plane-table order. The altitudes above the sea are given in Danish feet for all trigono metrical and other important points. Each plane-table sheet is 4' in lati tude and 6' in longitude The parish limits are taken from the records of the Royal Exchequer. The correct spelling of the names of places is determined according to present pronunciation, a reference to the origin of wdiich is sought in the district in older writings or etymology So far as possible prehistoric monuments are shown on the map. The border lines of the atlas sheets are formed by two systems of straight lines parallel with the main axis. The maps are issued both with and without topographic reliefs Regarding the contents of the atlas sheets (being mainly reproductions of the original plane-table sheets, scale 1:20,000), with the exception of very small areas, disappearing in the scale of the map, descriptions appear"], [417, "DENMARK\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 409 in the two principal title or index sheets. It may, however, be remarked that for the Islands of Lealand and Falster, with the small islands adjoin ing, the atlas sheets (Nos. 12, 13, 20, and 21) are provided with 5-foot hori zontal curves; \"all the other sheets, on the contrary, have them only at 10 feet; also that the first seven atlas sheets published, Nos. 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, and 21, are offered to the public in three different forms: (a) without ter rain, (b) with terrain, executed according to the Lehmann method; and (c) with terrain, represented by parallel curves. This expensive manner* was given up by the decision of the Ministry of War in 1853. While there has not been made in the course of time any really essential alteration in the plan for the contents of the atlas sheets, a very great one has been made with regard to the manner of execution. In the beginning the whole sheet was engraved by hand, which, together with the troublesome tracing of the pentograph reduction, made the preparation of an atlas sheet tedious and expensive. A very important advance in that direction was made by the introduction of the Serensen engrav ing-machine, the chalcographer, by which it not only, as before mentioned, sets down on the copper plate, directly from the plane-table, all kinds of lines, but at the same time engraves perfectly all coast lines and the parallel curves, which latter require especially much time in hand engraving. This instrument was employed for the first time in 1860, and has since effected a very important saving. The engraving of the atlas sheets cost now only about one-half, while the time required is likewise reduced at the same ratio. The corrections on all the engraved work are made by the officers. Of the entire atlas the eastern group of islands (Zealand, Moen, Lea land, and Falster) and the western group (Fyn, Samsoe, Taasinge, Lange land, and \u0152roe) were published on the scale of 1: 80,000, in 29 sheets and title page, iu 1845-1872, while of that of Jutland, on the scale of 1 : 40,000, there have been published from 1870 to date 69 sheets and title. The rest of Jutland, several sheets of which are in preparation, and also Bornholm, will require at least 12 years. By a carefully calculated computation, made in 1853, in accordance wdth which the whole atlas (South Jutland included) * Two of the engravings, answering to \" 6\" and \"c,\" were produced by galvano-jilastic from \"a,\" and with the terrain afterwards added."], [418, "410 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. could not be expected to be finished until the year 1960, but unexpectedly the course of the work has rapidly grown since the time above mentioned, partly through introducing better and more rapidly working instruments, partly from the greater practice of the individual worker and the better methods employed, but principally from the fact that the Topographical Section of the General Staff acquired in 1867 an important expansion, brought about by the representations of that organization to the Govern ment and the Diet, that such a measure was necessary for hastening the survey and the publication of the map. Since 1865, however, the task to be completed has been very much increased over that set in 1830, i. e., a map of 1: 80,000. The scale of 1:40,000 being adopted for Jutland, the number of atlas sheets required for that portion of the country was increased fourfold. It has been held also since the year 1865 to be of the greatest importance, for purposes both military and civil, to issue a map on the scale of 1 : 20,000 for the whole country. description of maps. Scale 1 : 80,000.\u2014 There are 81 sheets, each 0m38 by 0m.47, representing an area of 20 Danish square miles. The triangulation has been calculated with great exactness by the method of least squares. The Cadastral Maps (scale 1 : 20,000) are made use of, reviewed and corrected, and all possible topographical details added. The heights of the principal points are stated in feet. The reliefs are in contours. For the hydrography of the coasts the surveys of the Royal Danish Marine is availed of, and the depth of the first four fathoms is indicated by fathom curves (1 fathom = lm.88), the deeper soundings being given in figures. The map thus constructed has been reduced to the scale of 1 : 80,000, and engraved upon copper with all possible care. Each sheet is sold separately. Upon each sheet is shown a scale in meters and another in Danish alens. A separate title or index sheet is issued, with explanations of topographical signs and a statement regard ing the entire work.

This map is reproduced, by photolithography, in six colors \u2014 vermilion for railroads and roads (three. classes), blue for water, brown for forests and plantations, green for meadows, moors, and marsh lands, car mine for heaths, and black for outlines, as boundaries, &c. There are many altitudes, but the general relief is not shown. This map is prepared with great care, and for the scale comprises a large amount of information. The following resume indicates the changes that have occurred since the General Topographical Map, scale 1: 80,000, was ordered, which, including Bornholm, was to have consisted of 8 1 sheets : First, this number was reduced to 66 after decrease of territory in 1864. Second, when Jutland was reached, its publication was undertaken on a scale of 1: 40,000, 131 sheets (the num ber of plane-table sheets of Jutland is 646, scale 1 : 20,000). Third, the eastern group of islands will be produced in 29 sheets, scale 1: 80,000 (the number of plane-table sheets upon which these are based is 284, scale 1:20,000); hence the final atlas of Denmark, now in progress, will consist of 29 sheets, 1 : 80,000 (Eastern Islands); 131 sheets, 1:40,000 (Jutland); and approximately 1,055 plane-table sheets, 1:20,000, embracing in aggregate tbe entire territory. The field minute sheets (1 : 20,000) are reproduced both by photolith ography and photozincography. Nine-tenths of Jutland, one-half of Funen, and one-quarter of Zealand have been published at this scale. The topo graphic maps of the vicinity of garrisons and of sections specially visited by tourists are chromolithographed in four or more colors. Plans of the vicinity of fortified places and war game maps have appeared at 1 : 10,000"], [420, "412 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. DENMARK. Geologic.

The director is Prof. F. Johnstrup, at Copenhagen. Every year during the very short summer of the Polar Arctic circle, two or three explorers are engaged in the examination of all the coast, fiords, and even the interior, as far as practicable. The reports are pub lished in Danish, with a French resume at the end of each volume or part. From 1879 to 1884, six parts were issued under the title \"Meddelelser over Gronland\" (Exploration of Greenland), besides a separate volume, pub lished by the Commission in 1878, under the title of \"Gieseckes Mineralo giske Reise i Gronland, 8\u00b0, Copenhagen.\" Each volume contains several geological and geographical maps. Those showing the great surface occu pied by the actual glaciers are most important. The period for which the explorations were established has been extended by law, and it is expected the examination will continue until complete, so far as explorations are possible in this most inhospitable and little accessible region."], [421, "NORWAY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 413 NORWAY. Topographic. Maps of Norway prior to the beginning of the 18th century are rare, although many old maps (without date) exist among the archives at the Military Geographical Survey at Christiania. The oldest with dates are : \"A map of part of the (\"Amt\") bailiwick of Bahus adjacent to Idefjord,\" i. e., inlet of Ide ; scale approximating 1:50,000 \u2014 1661 ; also, \"a land and boundary map of the South Mountain range in Norway,\" &c, approximat ing scale 1:400,000 \u2014 1696; as well as \" a correct and accurate bound ary map between Aalen, Tydalen in the \"Amt\" of Drontheim on the Norwegian, and Herdahlen on ihe Swedish side,\" approximating scale 1:80,000 \u2014 1696. Maps of the sea coast from Fredrikshald to Arendal and Hesnaes and of the Bay of Christiania are of prior date in the reign of Christian V. \"Bailiwick\" maps are found of date of 1704, and a general map of Norway, of the year 1761. By rescript of October 16, 170G, the Norwegian clergy were required to prepare a description of their parishes, and transmit them to the royal historiographer, in order that the material might be used in a statistical and topographical description of Norway, which was, however, never completed. A so-called \" Forest and Timber Commission\" was established in 1725, afterwards abolished, and again re-established in 1732, and abolished finally in 1737. Its purpose was to promote a knowledge of rural matters ; also to encourage and direct indus tries connected therewith. A commission of German foresters was established in 1737, whose duty it was to collect information concerning forestry and the timber interests in a single diocese, of which a topographical description and map was to be published. This commission was merged (1739) into a Forestry Depart ment, attached to the Department of Finance, with semi-independent func tions. The want of a good map being felt led to detailed horizontal surveys in several of the southern dioceses, and continued to the year 1746, long before a map of all Norway, originally intended, had been completed. These explanatory maps were drawn on the scale of approximate!}7* 1 : 100,000. At"], [422, "414 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. the same time topographical-statistical descriptions concerning boundaries and soils, rivers and streams, minerals, mines, and smelting-works, forests in gen eral, &c, arranged according to bailiwicks, were prepared. These maps contained the principal rivers and mountains, roads and churches, the saw mills, farms, with the woodland and cultivated spaces in colors. These topographic labors were soon forgotten, and only brought to light by Pontoppidan while preparing his map of Norway published in 1785. The originals are now incorporated with the archives of the Geographical Institute. A certain amount of interest for topographic works in Norway appears to have been awakened during and subsequent to its operations. Many Norwegian maps are still preserved made during the interval from the abolishment of the Forestry Department to the establishment of the Topographical Survey (1746 to 1773). Many maps containing boundaries, roads, conscription districts, and churches (date 1765) were prepared by military authority and knowiT as regimental maps. General maps of Norway were published by Falken skjold (1757), Wangensteen (1761), and Hoff (1762). Pontoppidan made use of all the material existing in 1785. As the demand for maps became greater the need for a general topographic survey was more and more felt, the establishment of which became possible through the Mathematical Mili tary School, where topography and map drawing were made special studies, thus gradually providing a number of men specially qualified for the work of the survey. A map of Norway, scale 1 : 200,000, conic projection, the private enter prise of Captains Ramm, Mun the, and Glessing, engraved on copper, was commenced, to be issued in 1826. Note : This brief notice is taken from an \" Historical sketch of the Geo graphical Survey of Norway,\" by Captain de Seue, Royal Staff* The area of Norway is approximately 125,646 square miles, with a population in 1875 of 1,806,900, or an average of approximately 14 to the square mile ; although the greater share of the population is confined to the southern half. * Selected translations from this document were made by Mr. Henry L. Thomas, official trans lator ofthe State Department, from which the above has been condensed."], [423, "415 NORWAY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. CIVIL DIVISIONS. Norway isdivided into 6 administrative dioceses or provinces, \" Stiffen ;\" these are subdivided into 17 \"Amts\" (counties) or bailiwicks, two of which are north and south portions. The \"Amts\" are subdivided in descending order of area into \"Fogder\" (districts), \"Praestegjelds\" (parishes), and \"Anneks\" (communes). MILITARY DIVISIONS. For military purposes Norway is divided into 5 brigade districts, sub divided into 20 battalion conscription districts, each of which contains from 2 to 8 muster circles, of which there are 83. These latter are divided again into 204 lot-drawing districts (Lodtr\u0153knings distrikter). The metric system was adopted in Norway May 22, 1875, and was to be generally used from and after 3 years from that date. The principal work of the Geographical Institute (Norges Geografiske Opmaaling) at present is the preparation of the material for a detailed topo graphic map (scale 1 : 100,000, in 54 sheets) embracing the southern portion, each sheet of which is divided when published into 4 parts, and each of the latter into 12, representing of an entire sheet, or one Norwegian square mile. The total number of the quarter-sheets necessary to cover the entire country would be about 350. This work in the field is conducted under the Geographical Institute formed by merging the Geographical Survey of the Department of the Interior with the Topographical Section of the Gen eral Staff. The administration of this service rests with the War Department. The following note taken from Lieutenant Nissen's memoir serves to give an idea of the present organization, supervision, and administration of this work : In 1828 the survey received the name of the \"Combined Topographic and Hy drographic Survey,\" which in 1833 was changed to the \" Royal Norwegian Geograph ical Survey,\" which again was changed to that of \"Norwegian Geographical Survey.\" With this, since 1872, has been united the \"Topographical Section of the General Staff,\" which consists of 1 lieutenant-colonel, chief (and also chief of Bureau) of the Norwegian Geographical Survey ; 2 captains, 2 assistants (as a rule), 2 cadets, 1 lith ographer, 1 photographer, and 4 non-commissioned officers. For the \" Norwegian"], [424, "416 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Geographical Survey\" there were added to these a fixed personnel of 1 naval officer, 6 officers ofthe army by detail, 1 accountant, and the necessary technical personnel (at times 21 persons). Besides these, as a rule, 1 or 2 naval officers, aud at times several additional army officers by short details. Officers of the army and navy are also spe cially detailed for field work. The general management of the survey is committed to a \"directory,\" consisting of the chief of the General Staff and two others selected for the purpose by the War Department. The special direction and management is held by the chief of Bureau. For his immediate assistance there is a \"Secretariat\" (one assistant and one non-commissioned officer), while the personnel is divided into the following sections: 1. Section for trigonometric aud topographic works (the chief of it beiug a captain of the General Staff). 2. Section for detail surveying and publication of maps (chief a captain of the General Staff). 3. The Hydrographic Section (chief, a specially assigned naval officer). 4. The Section for engraviug and printing (chief, tbe lithographer of the Gen eral Staff). 5. The photographic galvano-plastic Section (chief, the photographer of the Gen eral Staff'), and also the office of the accountant, by which the sale of the maps is carried on. The frequent wars between Denmark and Sweden and Norway appear to have been the particular cause wliich gave rise to the establishment of the survey of Norway. The necessity for maps for military purposes on the border districts induced the chief of the Artillery and Engineer Corps to obtain an appropriation for making a military survey of the region, between Enningdalen and Stene Skandse in the Vaerdalen, along the Swedish border.-' An officer of the General Staff .was selected as leader of this survey and the special regulations for it are found in a letter of instructions (the oldest found in the archives) dated Christiania, December 14, 1773. The scale first adopted for field-work was 1:86,400, which was changed to 1:72,000 in 1781. In 1815 it was decided that the field minutes for the map of 1 : 100,000 should be taken on the scale 1 : 20,000. Subsequently the scales of 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 100,000 were employed for mountain work and 1 : 50,000 generally for cultivated districts. It appears now to be the rule to conduct the field-work generally to the scale of 1 : 50,000, with that of 1 : 25,000 for thickly populated districts, and that of 1 : 100,000 for moun tain tracts. The topographic relief was formerly shown by hachures for cultivated portions, and crayon stippling for the mountains. Since 1870, however,"], [425, "NORWAY\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 417 reliefs are represented b}T horizontal curves at equidistances of 100 feet, (now 30m) for scale 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 100,000, and 25 feet (now 10m) for that of 1 : 25,000. Between these curves hachures are introduced for cul tivated areas and crayon stippling for the mountains. Forests are repre sented by special conventional signs, aneroid barometers, and small alt azimuth instruments have been employed for altitudes. Each plane-table sheet for the scale of 1 : 50,000 embraces about 4 Norwegian square miles. The originals are always accompanied by a topographic, militarv, and partly statistical description. Up to the close of 1878 there had been sur veyed the greater portion of the country lying south of a line between Wumso and Stenkjaer and the bailiwicks of Tromsoe and Finmark, sketched at a scale of 1 : 100,000. The general topographic map (known as the rec tangle map) is published in rectangles of 14.4 by 10.8 Norwegian inches, representing 3 by 4, or 12 Norwegian square miles. The publication was begun in 1869. Each sheet aggregates about 630 square miles. Reliefs are in contours, with effective crayon shading, vertical light. Water is represented in blue, letterings and outlines in black. These parts are engraved on copper and the remainder on stone. A base was measured on the ice during the winter of 1834-35, near Christi ania, which connected with the position of the Astronomical Observatory, is the origin of co-ordinates from which the entire triangulation proceeds. Between the years 1845-50 Norway participated in the Russo-Scandina vian decree measurement from which resulted a belt of triangles between Fuglenes at Hammerfest and the Swedish boundary. Since 1863 the geo graphical survey first, and now the Geographical Institute, participated in works of the Commission for European degree measurements, which had led to the connection of other belts of triangles with the European net. Upon these belts rest all the subordinate triangulation. Various hydro graphic maps of the coast have been undertaken by the Geographical Survey, and upon its maps have been based the geological representations of the formations by the latter service. Deep-sea soundings have been added of later years, and special reference may be had to the quoted works in Danish by Captain de Seue and Lieutenant Nissen, of the Norwegian Staff, as wrell as for numerous and instructive details that it has been impracticable 1366* WH 27"], [426, "418 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. to include herein.

The instruments employed for tbe regular topographic, exploratory, and coast-survey work have followed in general the improvements made in Europe during the period of years involved. The \"Storthing\" granted, in 1875, a sum for the expenses of an expe dition sent out to explore that part of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea lying between Norway, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland, with regard to its physical and zoological relations, a work which came under the direc tion of the \"Geographical Survey,\" and, according to the plan, to consist of deep-sea soundings, meteorological observations, sea temperatures amt"], [427, "NORWAY\u2014 GEOLOGIC. 419 chemical composition, magnetic observations and zoological investigations, extending over a period of three years.

A survey of the vicinity of Christiania had been begun in 1883 at the scale of 1: 10,000. The Index Map of 1885 shows 43 quarter atlas sheets as completed. The work as a whole continues in vigorous progress, having steadily increased gradually since its commencement, with a knowledge of and requirements for the uses to which the graphic results of topographic works are applied from decade to decade. Note. \u2014 From official data lately received from the chief of the General Staff (Col. C. G. With) at Christiania, it appears that a Lieutenant-Colonel of the General Staff is now the director in chief of the Geographical Institute with the title \" Chef for Norges Geografiske Opmaaling,\" while also a Com mission (principally consultative) has been organized, known as the Norwegian Geographical Com mission (Norges Geografiske Commission), consisting of 6 members, military and civil, with the chief ofthe General Staff as its president. This Commission is found under the administration of the War Department, now known as the Ministry of Defense, since the War and Marine administrations are united. NORWAY. Geologic. The Geological examination of Norway was commenced in 1858 after a plan drawn up by Th. Kjerulf, Professor of Geology at the University of Christiania, in conjunction with his collaborator (T. Dahl), and placed by the Home Department (Ministere de l'Inte'rieur) under the directorship of the former. Its object is to prepare and publish a Geological Map of Norway, with accompanying sections. The work is conducted with the topographic maps of the Topographical Survey (scale 1:100,000) as a base. Two or three months of each year since 1858 have been employed in the field by the gentlemen above mentioned, as well as by others specially retained. Maps for recording field minutes of the scales 1 : 20,000, 1 : 50,000, 1 : 100,000,"], [428, "420 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. and 1 : 200,000 are used. Maps are also published on the scale 1 : 400,000, and a large manuscript map has been prepared on the scale of 1 : 200,000. Two of the detailed sheets (scale 1 : 100,000) had appeared in 1876, since which date the work has steadily progressed by the use of the inconsfderable annual sum of 10,080 kroner (8 kroner = 9 marks) zz 11,340 marks \u2014 approximately, $2,835. Seventeen sheets have been issued since 1876; comprising the provinces of Christiania and Fredrickstadt (5 sheets), Hamar (2 sheets), Bergen (12 sheets), and Trondhjem (8 sheets). From 1858-1865 the provinces or dioceses of Hamar, Christiania, and Christiansand were examined by Kjerulf and Dahl, and a map published in 10 sheets (scale 1 : 400,000), with sections, explanations of signs, and a con cise pamphlet. The special personnel consists of either mining candidates or other students at the University, independent of the services of ordi nary assistants, who could be employed from year to year. A synoptical map of the province of Trondhjem was issued in 1874. The provinces of Trondhjem, Bergen, Finmark, Tromsoe, and Nordland have been taken up as the topographical published or manuscript maps have become avail able. The synoptical map of Southern Norway appeared in 1877, the examination of which region has meanwhile been carried forward. In 1879 Dr. Theodor Kjerulf published a general description of Southern Norway \" Udsigt over det Sydlige Norges Geologi,\" Christiania, 4\u00b0, with a folio atlas of 39 plates and a geological map, \"Geologisk Oversigtskart over det Sydlige Norge,\" 1878 (a very large sheet), scale 1:1,000,000. A German translation, by Dr. A. Gwelt, of this important work appeared in 1880. Dr. Tellef Dahl completed the cartographical work in publishing in 1879, at Christiania, a large geological map of Northern Norway, on the same scale of 1: 1,000,000, comprising the rest of the Kingdom of Norway, the Lofoden Islands, and the North Cape, as far as Russian Lapland. Dahl had four assistants in the exploration for and compilation of this difficult geological map, executed between 1866 and 1879. Special attention has been given to the glacial formations, and two maps with memoirs were published by Kjerulf, one in 1859 for the region of Christiania fiord, and the other, more general, embracing the whole"], [429, "421 PORTUGAL\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. of Southern Norway, in 1877, under the title of \" Les Stries, les Moraines et les Blocs erratiques Dans la Norvege meridionale.\" The publications are in Scandinavian, French, German, and English.

Norske Universitet,\" Christiania. Dr. W. C. Brogger, the paleontolo gist of the Survey, has published lately very important memoirs or mon ographs of the primordial and secondary fauna of the Lower Paleozoic rocks. The collections made by the Survey are deposited in the mineralog ical cabinet of the University of Christiania. PORTUGAL. Topographic. In Portugal the trigonometric, topographic, hydrographic, and geologic works are united under one direction, which is now under the Ministry of Public Works. The area of Portugal is approximately 34,418 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 4,708,178, or an average of approximately 136 per square mile. CIVIL DIVISIONS. For administrative purposes Continental Portugal is divided into 8 provinces, subdivided into 17 districts, and again into parishes, \"Freguesia.\" MILITARY DIVISIONS. Portugal is divided into 8 military districts, identical with the civil provinces. The measures of length and surface have, since October 1, 1868, been the same as those of France, but with Portugese denominations (see Notes on Surveys \u2014 Intelligence Branch, War Office, London, 1882, p. 97). Geographical works have been fostered for long periods by this Gov ernment, and topographic works resting on a trigonometirc basis were inaugurated toward the close of last century. These works, experiencing"], [430, "422 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. various vicissitudes, seem to have been revived at the creation of the Ministry of Public Works in 1852. The \"general direction\" of geodetic, chorographic, and hydrographic works was created by order of this Ministry December 9, 1856. A decree of December 30, 1864, fixed its character and gave the name of \"Geographical Institute.\" This institution was transferred in 1868 to the War Ministry and given the name of \"De'pot General de la Guerre.\" In December, 1869, the present \"general direction\" of geodetic, topographic, hydrographic, and geologic works was established under the Public Works' administration. It is divided as follows: I. Main geodetic works. II. Secondary geodetic works. III. Chorographic and topographic. IV. Hydrographic. V. Geologic. VI. Reduction of notes, engraving, printing, accounts, &c. Provisionally there had been also a special astronomic work under this direction, looking to the establishment of an observatory of the first class, near Lisbon. MAIN GEODETIC WORKS. The geodetic or trigonometric works are limited in the main to those needed, preparatory to the construction of maps. An arc of meridian of 6\u00b0 45' has been measured, which joins the Observatory of Lisbon with that of Paris, which in turn had been thus con nected with Greenwich. The reconnaissance for the main triangulation was made between 1790 and 1803, during which time 2 bases were meas ured. This branch was interrupted till 1834, and again taken up and enlarged in 1856. Portugal joined the International Commission for European degree measurements, since which date the triangulation has been revived. The angles have been observed with all the care and skill known to modern science, and in 1878 about three-fourths of the entire main net had been completed. The origin of co-ordinates is the Observatory at Lisbon; two latitude and numerous azimuth checks have also been introduced."], [431, "423 PORTE GAL\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. Different special lines of levels of precision (the lines of sight not exceeding 10 kilometers) have been run, starting from points on the coast and con necting with main triangulation stations. Initial altitudes have been deter mined by reference to tide-gauges and registers at 10 different points, the zero being taken as a 5-year mean sea-level of a locality near the villa of the \"conde.\" The above are independent of the mass of levels required for hydrographic and topographic determinations. Various calculations have been prepared in this branch. New check bases and other astronom ical latitudes and azimuths are to be measured. SECONDARY GEODETIC WORK (second Section) Following the main triangulation, a secondary one (with sides of .approximately 2,500 meters) is made, covering the entire country. They are well conditioned, connected triangles, taking advantage of all natural and artificial points. In 1878 four-fifths of the Kingdom had been covered and more than 7,000 points established. Each triangulation (main and secondary) is platted to the scale of 1:100,000, the altitude of each station computed and alphabetically recorded. The triangulation of the second order is found sufficient for estab lishing the points for the map scale 1 : 100,000. Where special plans (more detailed) are required a tertiary triangulation is introduced. All resulting points become available for the topographic section. TOPOGRAPHIC WORKS. These works, independent of those purely topographical, comprise the surveys for geographic and chorographic maps, the cadastre and leveling of the country. One of the regular duties of this section has been the constant revision of a general topographic map, scale 1: 500,000 (125 meter curves) for the public services in general and for the geological reconnaissance. This map has been considered only as a first reconnaissance of the country. Based upon it, and the material gathered later, a map for general uses has been executed (scale 1: 1,000,000); also a map (scale 1: 200,000) express ing reliefs (based upon the general topographic map, scale 1: 100,000, \u2014 37 sheets) is in progress. The main general topographic map of this country"], [432, "424 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. consists of 37 sheets (each of size 0m. 8 by 0m. 5, embracing approximately 1,550 square miles) published in black from engravings on stone at scale of 1 : 100,000. The field minutes or plane-table sheets, upon which it is based, have, of later years, been taken at the scale of 1 : 50,000, and these in turn, as required, are being and to be, published at this scale. It is assumed that the detailed triangulation has been so conducted that from each plane-table station three others shall be visible. The order of occupation is determined by the chief of the topographical section. Everything that can be deline ated on this scale is shown, .. e., cities, villages, isolated houses, mills, lime kilns, means of communication, water-courses, canals and lakes, woods and copses, as well as everything under cultivation or inclosed. Territorial divisions are indicated, and in a separate sketch the limit of cultivation as well as the various kinds of forests. (For detail regarding conventional signs see lists for each country and plates in \"Notes,\" War Office, London, 1882, pp. 15, 24, 35, 47, 58, 71, 84, 89, 99, 107, 113, 124, 128, and Plates I to XVII.) Curves at equidistances of 25 meters, the result of trigonometric levelings, are employed. All of the above are drawn in pursuance of standard conventional signs. Of the 37 regular atlas sheets, 22 had been engraved and published in 1885, and 10 others (scale 1:50,000), resulting from the plane-table sheets, had been issued in 1878. Several special topographic works, of limited localities, have been undertaken on scales 1 : 1,000, 1: 2,500, 1 : 5,000, and 1:10,000, such as the national forest of Leira, the country between Lisbon and Cape Roche, &c ; as well, certain fortified places have been surveyed at the scale of 1 : 5,000. In these more detailed works use is made of the stadia and chain for dis tances. River nraps have been issued at scales 1 : 2,500 and 1 : 20,000. There is a map of Lisbon and vicinity, scale 1 : 5,000, revised to 1879. Mention is made in the annual report of this office for 1884, of the reduc tions of sheets 1 : 100,000 to scale 1 : 250,000 for a new general map of the Kingdom. Special topographic labors on larger scales are also in prospect for thickly settled localities, the mouths of rivers, &c."], [433, "425 PORTUGAL\u2014 GEOLOGIC. REDUCTION WORK, &C. After the decree of 1869 this section was charged with drawing, engrav ing, accounts, &c, and has been divided into the three following classes : 1. Accounts, depots, administration, and general affairs. 2. Office, library, and archives. 3. Atelier aud artistic works of the General Direction. Engraving on stone has been the rule, although the hydrographic charts are to be engraved on copper. The process \"Eckstein\" has been employed for chromolithography. There had been engraved in 1878, independent of the maps and the regular atlas, 32 other maps and plans of various scales, with many in prog ress. The three classes of works, topographic, hydrographic, and geologic, are still in progress under the \"Direction of Geodetic Works\" (Trabalhos Geodesicos) with General C. Arbues Moreira as director. The director gives an estimated cost for the field-work of 4,000 hectares at scale 1 : 100,000, at about 120,000 reis or 667 francs (approximates 88.64 per square mile). PORTUGAL Geologic. In 1857 the Geological examination was organized under the name of \"Commission Ge'ologique du Portugal,\" with the Colonel of Artillery (after wards General), Carlos Ribeiro, director. Since his death, in 1882, the director is Joaquin F. N. Delgado, Colonel of the Corps of Military Engi neers. Many geologic and paleontologic memoirs have been published, as well as a fine geological map, in 2 sheets, scale 1:500,000, 1876, which figured at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. The memoirs are monographs (quarto), in French or Portuguese; some times both languages are employed together on the same page. A bulletin, called \"Comtnunicacaes,\" (octavo,) is also published. All publications bear as title, \"Seccao dos Trabalhos Geologicos de Portugal,\" if in Portuguese; and if the memoir is printed in French, the title is \"Section des Travaux Geologiques du Portugal.\""], [434, "426 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. It is General Ribeiro who conceived and executed the project of lead ing (amener) water from a spring, found in the Cretaceous Sandstone, more than 100 kilos from Lisbon, to feed the capital of Portugal. The Portuguese Geological Examination which since its reorganization in 1869 bears the name of \"Secqao dos Trabalhos Geologicos de Portugal,\" is a section, and forms a part of the General Direction of Geodetic Works called \"Direccao Geral dos Trabalhos Geodesicos,\" under the Minister of Public Works. The geological examination of Portugal was organized by decree of August 8, 1857. A decree of August 31, 1852, creating the Geologic Com mission, ordains that it shall be composed of a central direction and of adjttnctive members. The decree of 1857, giving the final organization, determines that the central direction shall be composed of twro members with equal powers, and it shall have within its jurisdiction to establish the general plan of operations, to visit the field and to give to the employed technical instructions necessary to special studies, in order to combine aud harmonize all in a single system, and to co-ordinate the partial works exe cuted for the preparation of the geological map. The adjunctive members specially destined for field-work are defined under the same decree to the number of four or more, according to the development which could be given to the work, and chosen from among the most capable of those des tined to the Service of Mines. In 1857 a single assistant was nominated, and the old Geological Commission found itself composed of three members, who divided their services between field and office. In September, 1862, a fourth employe' was added and specially charged with chemical examinations and photographic work, but in 1865 this place became vacant. As to the auxiliary personnel, their minimum number was not defined, and consisted of one engraver, two lithographers, three or four collectors, one librarian and curator of specimens, and, temporarily, one person in charge of office and one lithographic printer. The Geological Commission was incorporated with the General Direc tion of Geodetic Works of the Kingdom, and constitutes a special section having independent functions in all its scientific work. Quite recently the technical personnel of this section has been augmented by two assistants,"], [435, "PORTUGAL\u2014 GEOLOGIC* 427 and was actually composed (in 1878) of one chief, three assistants, one sec retary, having the library under his charge, and four collectors. In 1878 General Ribeiro succeeded in securing the services of a Swiss geologist and paleontologist of capacity and reputation, Mr. Paul Choffat, who has since explored and described monographically several parts of the Portuguese secondary rocks (Jurassic and Cretaceous). Mr. Choffat is an \"attach^\" ofthe survey as paleontologist. The two establishments have for their internal administration and their relation with the Government a single chief, the Director- General of the Geodetic Work. In 1868 the commission was dissolved, but geological studies were continued by two of its old principal employe's. In December, of the same year, these studies received another organ ization; and the material required for their continuation \u2014 that is to say, the lithological and paleontological collections obtained on the ground or pur chased, the library and the chemical laboratory \u2014 passed to another scientific establishment. In fact, the geological works were interrupted until the actual organization of the General Direction of Geodetic Works, which took place December 18, 1869, the epoch at which they are incorporated anew in that General Direction where they now form a distinct section. As to the two members ofthe old commission, wdio were until 1867 charged with field labors, they were named the one chief, the other assistant. From this point of view, the labors executed until now, although they can be considered as a solid base for future researches, have still a certain want of completeness. The works of this section and of the old Geological Commission are divided naturally into two distinct groups, according as they have been executed in the field or office. The first group comprehends the taking of geognostic notes and journals of travel, the collection of fossils, of rocks and of minerals found isolated or dispersed according to geological profiles, collections having for an aim to make known the composition of the soil and the stratigraphical relations of tho beds, the graphic representation of she profiles, the copy of the explan atory designs of the various geognostic phenomena, in fine the trace upon the map of the limiting lines of the different formations. The second group"], [436, "428 GOVERN^\u00c6NT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. comprises the arrangement of geognostic facts collected upon the ground and in the note-books. The study and disposition of the collection of rocks and fossils for the distinction and classification of the various sedimentary groups, the reduction of geological and paleontological memoirs accom panied by drawings of fossils, of profiles and views, to serve for the descrip tion of each group, the works of physical and chemical analysis, having for an aim the knowledge of rocks and lastly the execution of all the works of drawing and engraving for the preparation of the geological map. Among these works executed upon the ground by this section and the old Geological Commission, there may be mentioned among others the following: Geological study and graphic representation of the cliffs of the littoral of Algarve, between Lagos and Cape St. Vincent. The part already engraved is printed from this design executed at the scale of 1:2,500 in an atlas of 13 sheets. The drawing of the marine escarpment, which rep resents really a geological profile, shows the exact order of superposition of the beds of the mesozoic and cainozoic systems of which the soil is composed, and at the same time the repeated accidents which have displaced them. Detailed geological study of Setubal and of the littoral region in the neighbor hood of the mouth of the Tagus, laid down on the topographic map of the new coast scale 1:30,000. These studies took till the autumn of 1803, and serve as a basis of two memoirs and a notice published by the chief of section ; also the exploration and study of various grottoes in the calcareous Jurassic region of Cesareda near Peniche and the tertiary \" molasse \" of the Palmella, where there has been discovered evident proof of the existence of prehistoric men of the paleolithic and neolithic periods, and full of precious gifts for the ethnographic knowledge of the tribes which have inhabited there, and for the knowledge of the contemporaneous fauna; also the detailed strati graphical study of the silurian basin of Bussac, having for an object to determine the different fossil horizons and the order of appearance of the species that peopled them. Reconnaissance studies have also been made of the entire country for the prepa ration of the general geological chart of the Kingdom, traced upon the geographical map, scale 1:500,000, accompanied by a detailed study ofthe ground represented by 5 chorographic sheets (scale 1 : 100,000). Dredgings have been made near the mouth of the Tagus in order to compare the fossils of the neighboring tertiary with living forms. Among office labors the follow ing may be mentioned : Classification and disposition of natural paleontologic collections. Arrangement and classification of 9,000 foreign paleontological specimens. Clasification and dispo sition ofthe lithological collections. Disposition and description of numerous partial profiles of rocks and classification of fossils which they inclose in the different beds for the true knowledge of the stratigraphic succession of the formations. Among the profiles, demonstrative of the geological constitution of the soil, the most extended and at the same time the most important are those which express the relations between the"], [437, "INDIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 429 secondary and tertiary formations which are developed, between the Tagus, the ocean, and the Sierra of Monte Junto. Classification and description of vegetable fossils from the carboniferous, the secondary, and tertiary rocks. Arrangement of information for the knowledge of the cultivated and uncultivated surface ofour Territory, labor which has served in the reduction of the report upon the general timber growth of the Kingdom, and the compilation of the map accompany ing it. Arrangement ofthe library of 4,100 volumes, brochures, and maps, and prepara tion of respective catalogues. A6 office labor may also be mentioned other miscella neous desiguiug of maps and plates, the eugraving and chromolithographic impres sion of the general geological chart, scale 1:500,000, and 5 detailed sheets, scale 1 : 100,000, that had been completed in 1878, and 13, 4\u00b0 and S\u00b0 pamphlets and publica tions on general or specical geological subjects. A new general geological map (1:200,000) is in course of execution. Meanwhile data for the several chorographical maps, based ou the military topographic map on the scale of 1 : 100,000, with occasional enlargement to double this scale, is constantly being collected. The map will be in 37 sheets when completed. THE SURVEY OF IXDIA. Topographic. The organization charged with the completion of this most important work has resulted from the amalgamation (January 1, 1878), under a single administrative and executive head of the personnel hitherto engaged on the Great Trigonometric, Topographic, and Revenue Surveys. The area of the British possessions and Native States of India, embrac ing what is known as the Indian Empire, aggregates 1,457,244 square miles, with a population (European and Native), in 1881, of 252,541,210, or an average of (approximately) 173 to the square mile. The atlas is projected to cover also Ceylon and the Straits settlements, colonies of Great Britain. CIVIL DIVISIONS. Three-fifths of the Empire of India, is divided for administrative pur poses into 8 provinces, 3 of which are commonly termed presidencies. The provinces are subdivided into divisions or collectorates. The remaining two-fifths are made up of native feudatory States, about 800 in number, of which only about 200 are of any importance."], [438, "430 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. MILITARY DIVISIONS. For military purposes India is divided into 3 presidencies, which are subdivided into 36 divisions and districts. The units of measure in India are innumerable, and the same desig nation has different values in different parts. The Guz (lineal) varies in different localities from 23 to 36 inches; the Beegah (superficial), which is different for almost every district, varies from about 1,600 square yards to 4,840 square yards (1 English half acre). English equivalents are coining into use in large towns. The personnel consists substantially of officers of the Royal Military Engineers and Artillery, and professional and technical assistants (mixed European and native), with Lieut-Gen. J. T. Walker, C. B., R. E., F. R. S. at the head as surveyor-general, the wrhole under the administration of the Department of Revenue and Agriculture. The numbers according to the India list of 1882, consist of 44 military officers and 160 civilian assistants. Surveys in India by Europeans began about the year 1600, the sailors having preceded the land surveyors by something like two hundred years. ROUTE SURVEYS. The exploration, survey, and mapping of British India has naturally followed acquisitions of territory. Prior to British occupation, all known geographical information was given on a map by D'Anville, an English edition of which appeared as early as 1754. Major Rennell conducted route surveys from 1763 to 1782. He describes his survey as covering an area of 900 miles long and 240 to 360 miles wide. The distances appear to have been chained and latitudes and longitudes of certain stations determined. Rennell's map of the Ganges and Brahmaputra are on the scale of 1 inch to 2 miles. A portion of the original reductions (in 15 sheets) on the scale of 1 inch to 500 yards are still preserved. An atlas of Bengal, resulting from about 500 distinct surveys (since superseded by revenue surveys) was published in 1781."], [439, "431 INDIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. Colonel Call succeeded Major Rennell as surveyor-general in 1777. At or about the year 1800 the main triangulation was begun, which was to furnish an accurate and permanent basis of the highest order of accuracy for all future surveying operations. Maps constructed from route surveys checked by astronomic obser vations, have been gradually discontinued, though still necessarily followed in explorations beyond the frontier, especially in the Trans-Himalayan regions. The labors of Rennell, independent of their eminent usefulness for the time, encouraged his successors, and are held in high esteem. The Government is also to be credited with having acknowledged with appreciation (substantiated by money guarantees) the difficult and meri torious work performed, especially by young surveyors, when warranted by creditable results. FIRST PERIOD OF TRIGONOMETRIC SURVEYS (1800-'23). Near the end of the last year of the eighteenth century, Major Lamb ton submitted, with the approval and recommendation of his commander, Colonel Wellesley (afterwards the Duke of Wellington), a project for a \"mathematical and geographical survey\" ofthe southern peninsula of India from the coast of Coromandel to that of Malabar. Thus the trigonometric survey of India owes its origin to the proposal of Major Lambton, in con nection with which was outlined the phase of the measurement of an arc of the meridian. The staff of this work was from the first, separate from that of the topographic and revenue surveys, only to be amalgamated January 1, 1878. Thus it appears that India was but a few years behind England and France in commencing geodetic measurements. The first attempt at degree measurement in which the principle of tri angulation was employed wras that of Snellius, in Holland, in the first part of the seventeenth century. The next noteworthy attempt was that of Picard, half a century later, in determining an arc extending from near Paris to Amiens in France, which was remarkable because angle measuring"], [440, "432 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. instruments (heavy telescopes fitted with cross wires) were used. An exten sion of Picard's work by the Cassini's between 1684 and 1718 went to show that the earth was a prolate instead of an oblate spheroid, as maintained by Newton and others. Shortly after Newton's death this matter was finally set at rest by parties sent out by the French, then at the head of geodetic science. Between 1735 and 1739 these expeditions measured two arcs, one in Peru along the Quito meridian, extending on both sides of the equator, and another in Lapland near Tornea, extending across the arctic circle, this latter measurement being the first to prove the earth an oblate spheroid. These were followed by measurements at Cape of Good Hope, 1750; Rome, 1755; France, 1790; England, 1802, &c, all of which were precur sors leading to the establishment of trigonometric surveys as a basis and check for scientifically accurate land measures. The point of departure for the trigonometric survey of India was the Madras Observatory. The astronomic observations were utilized not alone to fix initial points for geographical purposes, but for the angular as distinguished from the linear measure of the degree. Under Colonel Lambton, the first superin tendent of the trigonometric survey, the primary triangulation was com pleted over an arc of 165,342 square miles upon the peninsula at the cost of \u00a383,537 (approximately $417,685), or at an average of $2.50 per square mile. Vol. 1 (4\u00b0) of the reports of the trigonometric survey of India, gives an account ofthe early operations of the survey from 1800 to 1830. SECOND PERIOD OF TRIGONOMETRIC SURVEYS (1823-1843). During the superintendency of Colonel Everest the great arc series bearing his name was completed, at a cost of \u00a389,833, embracing a trian gulated area of 56,997 square miles (average per square mile, $7.85). The Bombay longitudinal series of 315 miles wTas completed at a total cost of \u00a313,742 for 15,198 square miles, or an average of $4.50 per square mile. He (Everest) introduced the gridiron as against the network sys tem of triangles, and conceived the survey substantially as it was after-"], [441, "INDIA- TOPOGRAPHIC. 433 ward carried out; he applied compensation bars for base measurements; invented heliotrope flashes and the system of \"ray tracing,\" designing the plans of towers, &c, retiring in 1843. THIRD PERIOD OF TRIGONOMETRIC SURVEYS (1843-1861). Sir Andrew Waugh during this period was in charge of both the trig onometric and topographic surveys. The Garwari meridional series, 235 miles in length, covering an areaof 6,298 square miles, at a cost of 53,019 rupeesrz $26,509.50, was executed (average per square mile = $4.20); also the Gora series, 208 miles long, area 4,416 square miles, cost 76,948 rupees =.$38,474 (average = $8.72). The Chandwar series, 181 miles in length, embracing 3,565 square miles, was also completed at a cost of 64,504 rupees .= $32,252 (averages approximately $9). The Parisnath series (4,765 square miles), and another (4,136 square miles), are also stated in Markham's memoir as hav.'ng been completed at costs, respectively, of $5.50 and $13.33 per square mile. Compensating rods were discarded in 1854, and simple iron bars, 10 feet long, coupled by a pair of microscopes, revolving on an axis and regu lated by a level, were substituted. Systematic leveling operations were begun in 1856. The height of Mt. Everest, the highest peak of the Himalayas, was determined by Colonel Montgomery, R. E., in using angles of elevation (elevation 29,002 feet). FOURTH PERIOU OF TRIGON OMETRIC SURVEYS (1862-1877). The offices of the trigonometric and topographic surveys were sepa rated during this period ; the former being in charge of Colonel (now Lieu tenant-General) Walker; the latter under Colonel (now Major-General) Thuiller. Triangulation series of 457 miles in length (area 23,620 square miles), and 587 linear miles (19,096 square miles), are reported as having been accomplished at average costs, respectively, of $4.20 and $2.30 per square mile. 1366 wh 28"], [442, "434 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. It was found that the error affecting astronomical observations on account of the deflection ofthe plumb-line, at Kalianpur, in vicinity ofthe Himalayas, was one-fourth of a mile. From pendulum observations it was discovered that the density of the strata near the Himalayas was less than under the plains to the south. FIRST PERIOD OF TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS (1800-1823) Topographic maps prior to 1800 had been dependent on route or meander surveys. Detailed topographic surveys, based on triangulation, were first introduced by Colin Mackenzie. During this period the surveys were separated in the different presidencies. Materials were gathered for a topographic map of the whole penin sula of India south of the Kistna, based on Lambton's trigonometric survey. SECOND PERIOD OF TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS (1823-1843). From 1823 to about 1834, there was a surveyor-general at Calcutta, and deputy surveyors-general at Madras and Bombay. In 1830 Colonel Everest, superintendent of the trigonometric survey, assumed the added duties of surveyor-general, and in 1834 the deputies were withdrawn. The revenue surveys in the northwest provinces, undertaken mainly with a view to provide a basis for land revenue, were commenced in 1823. During this period many new districts were surveyed- and others resurveyed. THIRD PERIOD OF TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS (1843-1861). The administration of the topographic and revenue surveys of this period was under Sir Andrew Waugh and his able deputy, Major Thuillcr, and large progress was made in both branches. The official manual of surveying for India, that has passed through several editions, was published by Captain Smith and Colonel Thuiller in 1851, and in 1861 Sir Andrew Waugh published his \"Instructions for Topographical Surveying.\" The following elements required for commenc ing the topographic survey were furnished by the trigonometric stations : 1. Point of departure, with latitude aud longitude. 2. A base. 3. Azimuth and true direction of meridian. 4. Height above sea."], [443, "435 INDIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. The large triangles were broken into smaller ones by the Ray trace system. The most important of the topographic surveys of this period are referred to by Markham as those of Kashwir and Sindsager Doab. FOURTH PERIOD OF TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS (1861-1877). Colonel Thuiller became Surveyor-General in 1861, having been a member of the Survey since 1836. The topographic surveys of the native States, of rugged character and small in revenue, have usually been on the scale of 1 inch to 1 mile, and follow urgent public requirements, while the triangulation followed methodically a fixed plan. During this period, includ ing the results of the revenue surveys, geographical knowledge was extended over an area of something like 250,000 square miles. Several maps independent of the atlas sheets proper were prepared and published during General Thuiller's administration, among them one for India entire (scale 1 in. zz 64 m.), to be utilized also for a geological map of India; another in 6 sheets (scale 1 in. zz 32 m.), and a hand map on scale of 1 inch to 128 miles; also, a map of Baluchistan, and a provincial series, &c. The cost of the topographic surveys for 19,317 square miles in 1875 '76 was at an average of $10 per square mile. The maps of scale of 1 inch to 1 mile have been found to be of constant and urgent necessity for all military, administrative, geographical, and engineering purposes In 1875-76 there were issued for official purposes in India alone 25,294 copies. It was estimated in 1878 that there was yet topographic work remaining to be done _ to employ seven parties 1 0 years (see Markham's Memoir). The history of the Survey under Colonel Thuiller will be found in his annual reports for 1854-55 to 1875\u2014 '76, inclusive. THE REVENUE SURVEYS. These form one of the bases of fiscal administration. They are an index to the wealth of the provinces, of their food producing capability, and of their capacity to bear taxation. They have been conducted differently in the various provinces, some commencing with the details and working from the part to the whole, while"], [444, "436 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. others, based on accurate triangulation, completed in advance, work from the whole to the part, and thus supply as well, valuable and practically accurate material for map compilation. Under the administration of Colonel Thuiller as Surveyor-General, all these works, coming under the charge of the Surveyor-General, have been done in this latter manner, the maximum error allowed being \u00a3 per cent., while the simple unchecked measurement of fields surveyed by native agency reached from 3 to 7 per cent. When the revenue surveys are made dependent upon the trigonometric net, they check the gross village areas and furnish material for the village map (scale 4 inches to 1 mile) and the district map (1 in. z= 1 m.), and are susceptible of incorporation in the sys tematic atlas (scale 1 in. = 4 m.). These surveys are usually made to the scale of 16 inches to the mile; but exceptional cases have required more detail, as 32 inches, while less thickly settled parts have been made upon the scale of 4 and even 2 inches to the mile. The approximate number of survey fields (about 2 acres each), measured in 8 districts only, was 7,000,000. An estimate is given (Markham's Memoir, p. 193) of 65,935 square miles in the Madras Presidency, surveyed on the 16 inches, 4, 2, and 1 inch scales, at a total cost of \u00a371,824 sterling, or at an approximate average of $5.50 per square mile. The Bombay Survey has been considered on the wdiole to be the best for revenue settlement purposes, but not so valuable for map compilation, on account of its want of checks. The town and Island of Bombay were sur veyed between 1865 and 1 872 at a cost of \u00a331,306 z= $156,530, the area being 22 square miles and 149 acres, or at an average of $7,040 per square mile. The fields and open country were surveyed on the scale of 1 inch to 100 feet, and the fort and native town at that of 1 inch to 40 feet. There resulted 172 sheets of uniform size (3 feet by 2 feet), with levels taken at each 300 feet along principal roads, with accurate contours for the hills at 10 feet apart. The Revenue Survey is designed to show all the principal variations of the soil, as hills, jungles, woods, channels, tanks, topes, houses, cultivated and cultivatable land, whether irrigated or not, with area of each field."], [445, "INDIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 437 The Madras Revenue Survey was brought to its strength, as given in 1878, in the year 1865-66. It was then composed of 3,377 persons (24 offi cers, half military, half civilian, 30 upper subordinates, 1,805 surveyors, clerks, and draughtsmen, and 1,518 laborers (.. e., chain and offset men, &c). This and the Bombay Revenue Survey are entirely outside the jurisdiction of the Surveyor-General's branch. In 1876 a \" Revenue Survey and Assessment Atlas of the Khandesh Collectorate\" was published at Bombay. This con tains, besides a general map, statistical tables of details of surveyed areas, of settlement, cultivation, occupation, and population, and of houses, wells, live stock, and agricultural implements. In the Madras Survey connection is made with the trigonometric stations, and also in Bombay where prac ticable. ROUTE SURVEYS BEYOND THE FRONTIER. Colonel Montgomerie, R. E., originated the idea of employing native explorers to make discoveries in unknown regions beyond the northern fron tiers of British India. These natives are trained to make a route survey, dependent on com pass bearings and paced distances, to take sextant meridian altitudes for latitude, but purposely are not taught how to reduce their observations, which is done at the office of the Surveyor-General upon return. It has been the intention in this manner to explore the entire country between the British and Russian possessions, if not a portion of Tibet Pathans were employed for the northern and southern valleys of the Hindu Ktish, the valley of the Oxus, and Eastern Turkestan, while for Tibet and the portions subject to Chinese government (with a Buddhist popula tion), Bhutiyas or Tibetans, belonging to the upper British valleys of the Himalaya, were utilized. Special maps of the results of these operations have been prepared, that add not a little to the knowledge of the physical geography of these regions. It is understood that these explorations had the approval of and are still being carried on by General Walker, the present chief of the Survey. TIDAL OBSERVATIONS. The earliest tidal observations in India mentioned by Markham were made at Kidderpur Dockhead, on the Hugh, by Mr. James Kyd, for 22"], [446, "438 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. years, from 1806 to 1827. These were never published in tables, but held as a series of diagrams. Subsequently observations were made at a few points in the bay of Bengal, and between 1835 and 1840 at Bombay. Tide-registers were kept also by the surveyors of the Indian navy until disbanded, although they do not appear to have been published. The annual tide-tables of the Admiralty have, however, given for 98 points the time of high wat* at full and change of the moon, with the spring and neap ranges. In 1868, Colonel Walker, then Superintendent of the Trigonometric Survey, was requested to arrange for determining the mean sea-level at various points, and self-registering tide-gauges were made in London and sent out to India. The actual operations do not appear to have been begun until 1873 by Lieutenant (now Captain) Baird, R. E., in whose charge they were placed. A self-registering anemometer and aneroid barometer accompany each tide-gauge. An apparatus, complete, was displayed in the Indian section, adjoining the Grand Canal, at Venice, and I am indebted to Captain Baird for an explanation of its practical working A brief description of the instruments and their use appears under the head of \" Exhibition.\" The very complete tidal operations now being carried on in connection with the \" Survey of India,\" afford data not only for calculating the rise and fall of the tides but establish a standard for all survey levels, and are also of high scientific interest. These observations, now being conducted at 15 stations (the latter connected by a line of spirit-levels), are intrusted to the immediate direc tion of Capt. A. W. Baird, R. E., specially deputed for the purpose. According to the Progress Report of 1880-81, the principal triangu lation for India entire, as originally designed by Colonel Everest, has been completed. Outside the limit of India proper there remains unfinished work on the \" Eastern Frontier Series.\""], [447, "439 INDIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. Thus the latitude, longitude, elevation, and azimuth of the primal points are determined with the greatest accuracy, the former referred to and connected telegraphically as well with the initial point of the survey (at the meridian of Madras Observatory), which is nearly central for India. Numerous bases of verification are introduced, and a secondary as well as a minor triangulation, governed by the detail required for the various localities, follows the primary. The 1-inch scale partakes of all the values thus established, and is considered sufficient for all the native chiefs' terri tories, where no assessment of land can be made. From the foregoing sketch it appears that, independent of the cadastral and village surveys, topographic field minutes, based on the main triangu lation, are being gathered at various scales, none smaller, however, than 1 inch to 1 mile, and that the results of the plane-table work, devoted more particularly to the relief of the ground, and the traverse work, for planime tric details, afford material for the systematic Topographic Atlas of the English Indian Possessions, in 177 full and 5 sub or partial sheets, at the scale of 1 : 255,561, or approximately 1 inch to 4 miles. There had been engraved (and printed April 1, 1885), according to Index Map herewith, 67 whole and 152 quarter sheets of this atlas. There remain unfinished a number of sheets for India proper, for Ceylon, for Bur mah and the Straits Settlements and the Malayan Peninsula, field minutes for portions of which have already been collected, while work is in constant progress during each succeeding season. While no limit has been assigned for the completion of this extensive work, it would seem that the greater part of the detailed field operations will have been accomplished during the present decade. The Indian atlas may fitly be termed a compilation of surveys, made in various detail, between 1 inch and 32 inches to the mile, all founded upon trigonometrically established quadrilaterals, checked by measured bases and initial astronomic points. The typical classes are \u2014 (t) The Geueral Topographic Survey (scale 1 inch to 1 mile) of the hilly, more rugged, and poorer portions of British districts and the Native States entire."], [448, "440 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. (2) The \"Mouzawar,\" or Village Survey, on the scale of 4 inches to the mile, of richer portions of British districts, as an aid to the operations of the settlement sur- veys. (3) Cadastral or Field Survey (usual scale 16 inches to 1 mile) of British vil lages for settlement purposes. The topographic surveys of the 1-inch scale is made by plane-table, on a trigonometric basis, exhibiting the positions of towns and villages, the watercourses, the general ground features, in as much detail as the scale will admit. Only general boundaries are located. The average monthly outturn, per plane-tabler, ranges from 35 square miles in difficult to 116 square miles in easy ground, or an average of approximately 2 square miles per day. The agency employed is mixed European and native. Plane-tabling is used also in the 4-inch scale survey, but on a basis of traverses (with theodolites and chains) following village boundaries, instead of on a triangulation basis. The limits of cultivated and waste lands are shown. The average amount accomplished by a plane-tabler is one-half square mile per day. Here also mixed European and native skill is employed. The bases of the cadastral survey (16-inch) are the traversed bounda ries The entire interior details are obtained by systematic chaining, care fully recorded in field books, available for future reference European and native agency combined is also employed. The average outturn of work is 1 square mile in 3 days for each surveyor. These recorded measurements may be used later for larger scales than the 16-inch, and are found of value also in deciding disputed property boundaries. The modus operandi of careful chain-measurements, made by one per son and plotted by another, is considered more accurate than the plane tabling (wherein no numerical record is kept of angles and distances) by which the details of the village and topographic surveys are obtained. The 1-inch scale survey has been termed by General Thuiller as the \"first survey of India.\" Boundaries of properties cannot be laid down on the 4-inch scale. General Walker estimates the 16 -inch survey as 16 times as valuable as the 4-inch and 64 times that of the 1-inch, at a cost of 4 times that of"], [449, "INDIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 441 the former and 7\u00a3 times that of the latter. The cost of publishing the map is excluded in all the quoted averages. The preparation and production of this atlas has always been under the control of the \" Surveyor-General,\" who has answered to the Govern ment for all surveys, except certain cadastral sorts, especially as regards financial executive control, while the trigonometric, topographic, and rev enue branches, the two former requiring professional talent, specially trained, had (until 1878) been conducted under separate chiefs, with special agencies adapted to each, by which means the cost could be better con trolled. The grade and character of the surveys have varied also, accord ing to whether British or Native (independent) States were occupied, the latter being less detailed; hence particular treatment by professionals of va rious grades and experience. Observers are specially trained for the minor triangulation plane-tabling and hill-sketching, which is considered sui generis. The rich revenue-paying districts require a larger scale, specially for definition of boundaries and limits to estates (a sort of parish survey), or what would be termed in England a tithe commutation survey (scale 4 inches = 1 meter), or sufficient to show the lands of every village. The periphery measurements are made by small theodolites and chaining The 4-inch scale is found sufficient where the villages form integral estates or communities. The data of the 4-inch scale reduced to the 1 inch makes valuable county or province maps, similar to the 1-inch maps of more inhospitable portions. Latterly this scale has not been found sufficient where land is subdi vided and where irrigation by new and extensive canals prevail ; hence the cadastral measurements of fields usually at 16 inches to 1 mile and some times even as detailed as 32 inches to 1 mile. Recent legislation as to sub tenants and irrigation now requires that much of this work should be per formed. Where these are conducted under the Surveyor-General a close connection is made with the general triangulation and the chief circuits are easily embodied in the general maps."], [450, "442 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The special Madras and Bombay revenue surveys operating from part to whole, referred to magnetic meridians, without scientific correction or attempt at confirming error, are not adapted to compilation in the general map. The area covered by an average full atlas sheet in latitude 24\u00b0 N. is approximately 18,066 square miles. The size of the part covered by topography is 37\u00a3 inches X 24\u00a3 inches, and the paper of the sheet is 39| inches X 26J inches. Quarter sheets on paper 19 inches X 26 inches (the space covered by topography, in sample sheet latitude 22\u00b0 N., being 12 inches X 18| inches), have been issued in certain instances. Each sheet comprises 2\u00b0 42' in longitude and 1\u00b0 26' in latitude. The general edition is in black, with hachures. Copies are also published with lines of color to show provincial and other boundaries. The annual cost of the trigonometric and topographic surveys for 1880-81 was \u00a3114,743 = approximately $573,715, and for the revenue surveys, under the Surveyor-General, for same period, was \u00a3185,388, or approximately $926,940, wliich includes, however, considerable funds for land revenue settlement. The average expenditures of the three branches of the survey department for the past ten years has been about \u00a3240,000, or an approximate total of \u00a32,400,000 = approximately $12,000,000. The means of reproduction employed in the regular atlas sheets is that of hand engraving on copper. At the photographic and lithographic estab lishment, at the main office in Calcutta, photolithography and photozincog raphy have been successfully employed, and experiments are now being made with a view to the introduction of heliogravure. So far as known no branch of the Government of India, other than the Surveyor-General's department, issue any general topographic maps. The economy of confin ing the field and office work of these extensive operations to a single rather than multiple administrations, is manifested by the very large production of results within a comparatively short interval and at so reasonable a cost. No other single Government, except Russia, has yet undertaken to make a connected survey of so great an area as that of the British Indian posses sions."], [451, "443 INDIA\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC.

The establishment of astronomical and triangulation points of the first order and measurement of bases has been of the highest order of accuracy, with instruments of modern approved patterns, imported from England and Europe, the method of least squares being adopted in the reductions. There has been measured an arc of a great circle approximately 16\u00b0 in length. The projection employed for the atlas is one of the numerous modifi cations of the conical development, representing the parallels of latitude by concentric arcs, but the meridians by arcs concave to the central meridian and not by straight lines, as in the true conical development. A cone is assumed to roll over the spheroid tangentially to an adopted central par allel of latitude, the distance from the vertex of the cone to this parallel (== normal X cot. lat.) is the radius of the projection of the parallel, and may be considered as the fundamental radius of the projection for the radii for all other parallels, which are determined by adding to or subtract ing from it the distances between those parallels and the central parallel. The angle subtended at the vertex of the cone by a longitudinal arc of 1\u00b0 in length is called the \"angle of projection\" for the parallel of latitude to which the arc appertains. As this angle varies with the latitude its value is computed for each parallel. The central meridian or axis of the projection is 76\u00b0 30' east of Greenwich.

Soc, Oct. 1885, p. 674 ct seq.) He speaks of the surveys as varied in nature, constitutin g a blending of many diverse ingre dients. Their origin was purely European, nothing in the shape of a general survey having been executed under previous Asiatic Governments, by which lands had been measured merely to acquire some idea of the relative areas of properties for assessment purposes. The operations, often prosecuted pari passu, have been geographical, topographical, and cadastral, all finally controlled by a rigidly accurate triangulation. He states that every variety of feature, of scenery, and of climate that is to be found anywhere between the Equator and the Arctic regions, has its analogue between the high lands of Central Asia and the Indian Ocean ; hence, certain parts of the work have been conducted"], [452, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 444 INDIA OFFICE.

Markham in 1867, and continued tinder his direction for ten years. It has charge of the collection of maps, supplies geographical infor mation when required, prepares maps, and passes the general catalogue through the press.

This sketch contains the design for an atlas of 177 sheets, each 40 by 27 inches, on the scale of 1 inch to 4 miles. On account of an error in the scale first used in their construction, the scale of the map proves actually to be 1:255,661 instead of 1:253,440. The tint shows the total number of sheets and quarter sheets issued to April 1, 1885, as determined from the offical survey catalogue, .. c, 61 whole sheets and 152 quarter sheets. The outlines for the index map have been taken from Markham's Memoir of the Survey of India, which has been availed of, as well as other known sources of information. with ease, celerity, and enjoyment, while others have been difficult, slow, under great and often deadly exposure. He claims for the work a degree of accuracy and precision equaled by few and surpassed by none of the great Government surveys. Measured by the graphic results, this great work now com prises: First, the general topography or India, mostly on the scale of 1 inch to the mile ; secondly, explorations and surveys in regions beyond the British frontier ; thirdly, the so-called Eevenue Survey ofthe British districts in the Bengal Presidency, which is simply a topographic survey on an enlarged scale (4 inches to the mile), showing the boundaries and areas of villages for fiscal purposes ; and, fourthly, the cadastral survey of certain British districts in the Bengal Presidency (showing field and all property boundaries), scale 16 to 32 inches to the mile. There are also certain large scale surveys of portions of British districts iu the Madras and Bombay Presidencies, which undertaken originally for fiscal reasons now add their quota to the general topography. A survey branch has also been added to the Forest Department, for compilation of large scale working maps on a trigonometric base iu co-oper ation with the Survey Department proper.

Geologic. The geological examination of India, under a superintendent, forms a sep arate branch of the Administrative Department of Revenue and Agriculture. The superintendent, at present Mr. H. B. Medlicott, with an assistant superin tendent, R. D. Oldham, and actually 18 assistants, in 1884, is in general charge of the work, the main office of which is at Calcutta, which proceeds without distinct legislation as to its organization or duties, but by virtue of annual grants of funds. It seems to have grown out of the appointment of a \"coal-viewer,\" who was to report on the principal coal fields; this official afterwards became a geologist ; assistants were added until the strength of the personnel reached the above stated number. The first Government geologist appears to have been appointed in 1817, but his services were dispensed with a year later. Meanwhile, in 1818, examinations were continued by an attache of the great trigonometrical survey, who reported on the rocks and minerals of different districts. In 1838 a committee made \"Reports on the coal and minerel resources of India,\" Calcutta. Dr. J. McClelland, secretary of that committee, pub lished the repoit, and also certain others in 1840, 1841, and 1843. Then Mr. Williams was appointed \"Geological Surveyor of India\"; but during the progress of the survey, and before he had time to publish or even prepare any report, he died in 1848. Dr. J.

In 1851, during the administration of Lord Canning as Governor-General, a new organiza tion, on a better footing than the previous one, was established. Dr. Thomas Oldham, then director of the geological survey of Ireland, to whom much is due for the creation and perfection of the work, was appointed chief, and the labors directed to districts where topographic maps"], [456, "446 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SUEVEYS. had been completed. It may be remarked, as could have been expected, in a country newly settled by Europeans, the entire topographic survey of which had not yet been completed, that the geologist was restricted in his field of operations to areas already mapped, for it appears that the expe rienced geologists of the Old World consider the possession of a good detailed topographic map as a necessary preliminary and guide to the field investigation, and as the graphic repository and record of his most critically observed data. Shortly after the establishment of the Survey, with headquarters at Cal cutta, the operations were extended in 1857 to the Madras Presidency, while the geological examination of British Burmah was begun in 1860, and map in hand the field was taken in the Bombay Presidency in 1863. Mining operations being so few and simple, no legislation looking to their control appears yet to have been needed, and hence the Survey has been almost purely geological, although the coal formations found to be extensive have received a large share of attention. The form of the work has been determined by circumstances, developing from the reconnaissance to the connected or areal shape, dependent upon the character and com pleteness of British occupation and the production of accurate maps. There fore it has only been practicable so far to publish the maps of special areas, while the now nearly completed Topographical Atlas, in 177 sheets, is fast becoming ready to receive the delineation in geological colors of complete and connected areas, which it is understood will soon be systematically begun. Up to May, 1885, about 121 sheets or parts of sheets had been published, accompanying the \" Memoirs\" or \" Records.\" The scales vary, and are too numerous, some being as large as 3\" inch zz 1 mile, and others only 1 inch \u2014 32 miles The most common scales used are : One inch \u2014 1 mile, 1 inch \u2014 4 miles, and 1 inch = 8 miles.

It is a very small geological map of Upper India only, without scale or name of author ; however, it is to be credited to Dr. J. McClelland. In 1853 another geological map, in several sheets, was published in London, by G. C. Greenough. Its title is : \" General sketch of the physi cal and geological features of British India \" (no date). The author was not connected with the Geological Survey, and was never even in India. Dr. W. Waagen, paleontologist to the Survey, issued, in 1878, a small map, \" Rough geological sketch map of India,\" accompanying a publication \"On the geographical distribution of fossil organisms in India\" (Record of the Geological Survey of India, No. 4, 1878; and also in German, in the Pro ceedings of the Imperial Academy of Science at Vienna).

GREECE Topographic. Greece and Turkey are the only nationalities of Europe without organ ized topographic surveys. The only map of Greece that can be considered official is the one published in 1852 by the War Department of France (scale 1: 200,000). The surveys upon which it was based were made by the engi neer geographers and officers of the General Staff of the War Ministry of France, at scale of 1 : 50,000, between 1827 and 1845. This was first engraved on stone and afterwards transferred to copper plate. Other general maps, covering parts or all of Greece, have been issued at Vienna and Berlin. TURKEY IN EUROPE. Topographic. The Turkish Government exhibited at the Geographical Exposition in Paris in 1875 some cartographic works prepared by officers of its General Staff; also a map executed by cadets of the military school, but no organ ized or systematic topographic survey of its territory has ever been under taken. These works have been confined to those accomplished (usually during or immediately subsequent to a war) by the neighboring countries of Austria and Russia. (See Reports on these nationalities.)

Albania, Thessalia, and Roumelia still remain little known topograph ically. With the above exceptions, and recognizing the labors of the Rus sian General Staff during the last war in the Balkan region, it appears that sufficient material has been procured for a general topographic map of all that part of Turkey lying north of the Balkans.

The part of the country beyond the Milcov (named also Moldavia) and that beyond the Danube (named also Dobroudgea) being totally without topographic surveys, the works have been commerfced there in conformity with the most modern geodetic and topographic methods. The geodetic works for Moldavia were commenced in 1874, and those for topography two years later. Both have been completely finished in the north in the following manner : (1) The geodetic measurements have been made by polygons of triangles, carried to the fourth order. As an initial base there has been taken one side of the Russian geodetic net determined trigonometrically in Bessarabia, and as a verification base there has been taken an Austrian one, determined by direct measurement in Roumania.

The geodetic and topographic field-works commenced in Dobroudgea in 1881 are completely finished. The details of execution employed in Moldavia have been, with the following modifications, used also in Dobroudgea : (1) The geodetic measurements have been connected with the geodetic base determined by the Austrians in 1856, and a triangulation made in 1881 and 1882.

Measures have been taken to publish them within the year, to continue operations in Moldavia, and to review the topographic works made this side of the Milcov (in Wallachia) in 1857 by the Austrians, which leave much to be desired in view of the ground changes since the above period.

Since the first attempt at the trigonometric survey of the eight provinces of Kwanto, in the ninth year of Meiji (1875), the work has been extended beyond that area, so that out of 100 selected points, nearly one-half have been determined by triangulation. This triangulation rests on a base-line laid out in the plain of Nasu (Prov ince Shimotsuke), and measured by the secondary base measuring rods (American pattern). After these attempts a general triangulation was begun for the whole Empire. The plain of Mika tagahara (Province Totorni) was chosen for one of the new bases, and the English rod, with micrometer reading to the thousandth part of a millimeter, was to be employed. Forty-five points were established between 1877-1882. Of the 24,796.63 square ri,* 5,438.5 square ri had been accomplished in 1882.

S. Lyman, chief geolo gist and mining engineer, 1877. Since September, 1880, when the field work of the present geological examination was begun, it has been attached to the (Tokio Daigaku) University of Tokio, with Dr. E. Nau mann as director. The following transcript from the Regulations of the Imperial Japanese Geological National Institute, bears upon the scope of the work : REGULATIONS OF THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE GEOLOGICAL NATIONAL INSTITUTE. \u00a7 1. It is the purpose of the Institute to make a systematic examination of the terrain formations of the whole country, with a special regard to economic require ments. \u00a7 2. The Institute is divided into the following sections : I. Geological. II. Agri cultural. III. Chemical. IV. Topographical. V. Administration. \u00a7 3. The geological section has to examine the land geologically and make geo logical maps with the help of the basic maps which have beeu prepared by the topo graphic section. There must be subjoined to the geological maps as many profiles as shall be found necessary for the understanding of the geological structure. Besides, the geological section is required to make au exploration and examination of the most important mineral districts, besides a systematic examination of the ore and coal dis-"], [465, "JAPAN\u2014 GEOLOGIC. 455 tricts of the country, which must be illustrated and described in the maps in tbe proper proportions, as also the technically important results and discoveries of the examina tion in treatises aud reports. \u00a7 4. It is the duty of the agricultural section to carry on an investigation of the parts of the Empire adapted to agriculture with special reference to the practical wants of the country, by a study of the predominant inherent features of the culti vated districts with the aid of all previous labors and researches profitable to this end. Parts of the Empire which are not yet under cultivation, but susceptible of it, call for detailed and particular consideration. The results are to be set forth in maps and reports, and the map representations are to be illustrated and completed by treatises and descriptions. In the execution of this work the principles applicable to the geo logical and also to the topographical sections are brought into practice. \u00a7 5. The chemical section includes, together with the more exact analytical inves tigation of its own technically important materials, also experimental tests of speci mens collected by both the above-mentioned sections and selected for investigation. Examinations are also undertaken on the part of the chemical section of materials sent in by private individuals for analysis, or of those the examination of which appears desirable in respect to the general ends of the institution. Investigations conducted in the chemical laboratory are worked up into reports. Industries, which are grounded on the introduction of raw materials examined, or which might be grounded on such introduction, should be made the subjects of special reports. \u00a7 6. The topographical survey of the country shall be carried ou by the topo graphical section and represented in topographical charts, a national work upon the exe cution of which chiefly depends the faithful representation of the soil. The technical aud agricultural value of the soil are to be treated of in reports. With regard to the observations and measurements specially undertaken in connection with the topo graphical works, as also with regard to the making of charts, reports will be drawn up; and the charts will be accompanied with explanatory and supplementary textual state ments. \u00a7 7. The administrative section is charged with, first, the delivery of all pam phlets arriving for the Institution, or sent by the Institution to other departments; and to this division belongs also the regulating of all personal matters, as well as of all matters which stand in direct relation to the technical works of the Institution. \u00a7 8. The survey works of the three divisions engaged in field-works are to be conducted so as to advance with equal speed. \u00a7 9. By means of the surveys of the Institution a general map is to be con structed illustrating the topographical, geological, and agricultural features of the land. The scale of 1:200,000 has been determined upon for publication. \u00a7 10. The map is composed of sheets, each covering one degree, and each one of these sheets is published separately. * * * Longitudes are reckoned from Green wich. \u00a7 11. The original topographic surveys for the general map work will be made on the scale of 1:50,000. \u00a7 12. The general survey shall be prepared by a reconnaissance of the whole countrv. \u00a7 13. The scale of 1 : 400,000 is fixed upon for the reconnaissance maps."], [466, "456 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. \u00a7 14. The Boune projection is employed for the general map work. \u00a7 15. Besides the above-mentioned maps, special charts shall be made So far as time and ability admit, and so far as a greater degree of specific representation appears to be needed. \u00a7 16. The terrain is to be represented by contours upon the charts made or to be published by the Institution. For the survey charts as well as for the general maps the vertical intervals of the equidistant curves are fixed at 40 meters. \u00a7 17. At the head of the Geological Institute of the Empire there is a ministerial chief of the administrative division, who is subject to the orders ofthe Minister. \u00a7 18. The administrative division is under the immediate control of the ministe rial chief of this division. \u00a7 19. The director of the survey is subject to the orders of the Minister and of the chief of the administrative division. \u00a7 20. The geological and topographical sections are under the immediate control of this director. \u00a7 21. There is also a chief of division at the head of the agricultural and of the chemical divisions. \u00a7 22. The chiefs of these divisions are subject to the orders and instructions of the director of the survey. \u00a7 23. It is the duty of the assistants to execute strictly and faithfully the instruc tions received from the directors of their division. \u00a7 24. The clerks of the administration who supervise the inventories for the libra ries, the apparatus, collection of instruments, laboratories aud the museum, and have in charge the delivery and restoration of objects belougiug to the Institute, are in every other respect governed by the instructions of the director of the division to which the respective appliances belong. \u00a7 25. The disposition, cataloguing, aud keeping ia place of the technical appliances of the survey are to be ordered aud conducted or executed by the four first divisions of the survey. The library and museum are under the care of the geological division, the collection of instruments aud apparatus under that of the topographical division. There is also a laboratory attached to the chemical and agricultural divisions. # # # # # # # According to information supplied by Dr. Naumann, the staff of officials intended for carrying out the above work was as follows : Foreigners : 1 director, 1 chief topographer, 1 chief agriculturist, 1 chief chemist ; Japanese: 12 geological assistants, 6 topographical assist ants, 6 chemical assistants, and 6 cartographers. In 1 883 the number was as follows : 1 director, 1 chief agriculturist, 1 chief chemist, 8 geological assistants, 5 topographical assistants, 6 agricultural assistants, 6 chemical assistants, and 7 draughtsmen. The original annual grant of money amounted to \u00a750,000, which, however, was subsequently curtailed, and the sum made to bear the cost"], [467, "457 JAPAN\u2014 GEOLOGIC. of publication, which impedes the most rapid progress of the work. The present work is the outgrowth of a memoir upon the advisability of a geo logical examination of Japan, submitted to H. E. Hiesbumi Ito, Minister of War, at the end of 1878. The work was established in 1879, field-work com mencing in 1880. The first plottings were made upon topographic maps at scale 1:200,000 in 1881. In 1881, a topographic and geologic recon naissance of the whole country was begun. The plots on scale 1 : 216,000 constructed therefrom were reduced to the 1 : 400,000 scale. Preliminary to this reconnaissance, an old Japanese map (resulting from what was known as Ino's survey, brought down to 1800-1810) was used. This work is spoken of as very accurate and reliable, especially as to the principal roads, rivers, and most important elevations, and therefore of much use to all later surveys. Special surveys on a larger scale have been made in about 16 half degree divisions, permitting of this number of final sheets, as shown upon an index map. The reconnaissance map was to have been finished in 1885 to 1886. Special magnetic observations were begun in 1882, more than 80 stations having been occupied in that year. In the construction of maps, the positions determined by the Ino survey, the trigonometric survey, and other official sources were used. A general preliminary map of the whole Empire (1 : 800,000) is in course of preparation. The topographers are provided with a small plane table and a traveler's theodolite. Perambulators are used for measuring distances, and the magnetic needle is generally employed. The geologists combine their geological observations with route sketching. Each plane table sheet corresponds to one-twelfth of a half degree division sheet, and is made at scale 1 : 50,000. For field work the staff of assistants is divided into groups, each consisting of 1 topographer and 2 geologists. Each group is usually intrusted with the topographical survey and geological examination of a district, corresponding to 1\u00a3 divisions ofthe special map. One topographer can survey about 12 square kilometers, and one geologist examine about 1 6 square kilometers, per day. This permits on an average one group to complete one division in about four months. With 6 topog raphers and 12 geologists it is estimated that the work could be completed in 1896, there being about 93 divisions or map sheets in all. The agricul-"], [468, "458 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. tural section confines its labors to portions of the country either cultivated or cultivatable, thus excluding the wilder and almost inaccessible parts. Many analyses of rocks and minerals have been made by the chemical sec tion and reports made. The director has compiled and presented personally no less than 11 reports, of which a few have been published in Japanese. In 1881, David Brauns, Professor of Geology in the Tokio \"Daigaku,\" with six assistants, among them two students of the \" Daigaku,\" published an important memoir, \"Geology of the Environs of Tokio,\" quarto, with plates, of fossils and a geological map. Dr. E. Naumann has issued a most important work, entitled \"Ueber den. Ban und die Entstehung der Japanischen Inseln,\" Berlin, 1885; and, finally, a Japanese geologist, Mr. Tsunashiro Wada, has published a detailed account of the geological survey, in a pamphlet, entitled \"Die Kaiserliche Geologische Reichsanstalt von Japan,\" at Berlin, 1885. Dr. Naumann bestows the highest praise upon the Japanese assistants, who labor unceasingly with great zeal and much ability. The Japanese direction of the Geological Institute is in the hands of Mr. Wada, geol ogist, well known to his countrymen, and who is now preparing an elab orate paper on Japanese minerals, to appear in German. The object of the work being prosecuted under Dr. Naumann is to prepare and present to the Japanese nation within the lifetime of one gen eration the result of a general geological investigation, relegating more complete details to a later period. The work forms a main division of the Noshomusho (Department of Agriculture and Commerce), having been formerly under the Land Office (Naimasho or Home Department). The reconnaissance map in course of publication is the first regular mapping work published in Japan. This is to be etched on copper by a Japanese artist. Engraving on stone by native lithographic skill proved unsuccessful, while heliogravure by aid of native photographers is passing the experimental stage. The Government Print ing Office, a well organized and regulated institution, is also experimenting in methods of reproduction. There is still another office carrying on cartographic work. The chi kika (a section of the Chisi Kioku) is compiling a generalized map of groups"], [469, "459 ARGENTINE REPUBLIC\u2014 GEOLOGIC. of provinces from old Japanese maps, village maps, &c. The local village maps (poor and unsystematic) have been made for purposes of taxation. Maps, usually compiled and of different valiie, have been issued by the local governments. Dr. Naumann mentions as having been published during the last few (ending 1 883) the following : One map by the Department of Education, one by the War Depart ment (Riku gunnosenbo kioku), and another by the \"Chisika.\" It would appear that Japan had originated more than an economical number of map-making institutions. DOMINICA OR SAN DOMINGO. Topographic and Geologic. A geological examination of San Domingo, accompanied by topo grapic observations, was made during the years 1869, 1870, and 1871, under the charge of William M. Gabb, as director, with 6 assistants. The work was topographic as well as geologic, and was placed by the President of the Republic of Dominica under the direction of the Minister of the Interior. The final report was published in 1873, in Philadelphia, in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. XV, new series, 4\u00b0, Art. IV, p. 49, under the title \"On the Topography and Geology of San Domingo, by William M. Gabb.\" Two maps (one sheet each) accompany the memoir, one in black, the other geologically colored by hand. Both are identical, each appearing with uncomputed scale. Their title is \"Geological Map of the Republic of San Domingo,\" by William Gabb, 1872. ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. Geologic. The Government \"de la Republica Argentina\" ordered a natural history examination, under the direction of Prof. Dr. H. Burmeister, but the financial difficulties attending political revolutions and foreign war pre-"], [470, "460 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. vented its continuation and also the publication of the results obtained from 1859 to 1875. However, Burmeister published a volume of \"Description physique,\" in French, with a small geological map, in 1 sheet, entitled \"Carte Ge'ognostique d'une Partie de la Republique Argentine,\" Paris, 1876. Since 1880, the examination has been resumed, under the direction of Drs. Adolfo Doering and Luis Brackebusch, and explorations have been made of the Rio Negro (Patagonia), and in the provinces of Salta, Jujui, and the desert of the Gran Chaco. A geological map of \"La Provincia de Jujui,\" by Luis Brackebusch, scale 1:1,000,000, was issued, in 1883, at Buenos Ayres. BOLIVIA. Topographic and Geologic Upper Peru, or Bolivia, shortly after its existence as an independent State, taking advantage of the explorations of a French naturalist, sent there by the \"Jardin des Plantes\" of Paris, asked Alcide d'Orbigny to con struct a geographical and geological map of the new Republic. D'Orbigny accepted the proposition of President Don Andres Santa Cruz, and from 1830 to 1833 examined the greater part of that central country of the Cor dilleras of South America. In 1839, the geographical map was issued in Paris, and in 1842, it was revised and published as a geological map, under the title \"Carte Ge\"neYale de la Republique de Bolivie\" (no scale), on a very large sheet. Bolivia took the lead of all the other South American states, and may be called the pioneer State for the geological works of that conti nent. CHILI. Topographic and Geologic. The Government of Chili established, in 1849, a \"Comision Topo grafica,\" with A. Pissis as chief or director, adding to his duty the charge of making, at the same time, a geological examination. In 1870 the work was so far advanced that the map, in 13 sheets, was placed for engraving in the hands of N. Desmadryl, in Paris; and, in 1873, it was issued under"], [471, "SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA\u2014 GEOLOGIC. 461 the title of: \"Piano Topografico y Geologico de la Republica de Chile, leventado por orden del Gobierno, bajo la Direccion de A. Pissis;\" scale 1:250,000. As the map is used as well for geography and topography as for geology, it has been published in black with limits of the different forma tions and rocks in dotted lines and geological indications \u25a0 by letters. A certain number of copies, however, have been published, hand-colored geologically. It is an important and very creditable work. The title of Pissis was \"Jefe de la Comision Topografica de Chile.\" He had two topographic assistants, and Prof. J. Domeyko, of the University, con tributed toward the geologic and mineralogie investigation. SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA. Geologic. Geological examinations were inaugurated respectively by Brazil, the United States of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, Salvador, Guate mala, and Mexico; but all have been stopped, either by the death or with drawal of the geologist in charge, or for want of funds. A few reports, however, have been published by Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico; but nothing definite has yet appeared on the geology of these regions. There should be mentioned, as containing the best available informa tion, the following publications: 1. \"Die Geognostischen Verhaltnisse Neu- Granadas,\" with a \"Karte der Verbreitung der Geognostischen Forma tionen in Colombien,\" by Hermann Karsten. 4\u00b0. Vienna (Austria), 1856. 2. \"Voyage Geologique dans les R^publiques de Guatemala et de Salva dor,\" with an \"Esquisse d'une Carte Ge'ologique d'une partie des Repu bliques de Guatemala et de Salvador,\" by A.

Paris, 1868; published by the French Government. 3. \"Physical Geography and Geology of Brazil,\" with a very small geological map enti tled \"Escoboda Carta Geologica do Brazil,\" by Orville A. Derby; Rio de Janeiro, 1884."], [472, "462 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Information is still wanting in regard to surveys being prosecuted in certain British colonies, and in all of the French, Dutch, Spanish, and Por tuguese colonies; but it is believed that no connected systematic topographic surveys resting on a trigonometric basis are being carried on in any of them. Nothing official has been received from the offices of the hydrographic sur veys of Sweden, Chili, Belgium, and the Dutch East Indies. Maps and publications have been furnished from the hydrographic offices at St. Petersburg and Tokio (the former in Russian and the latter in Japanese), none of either of which have yet been translated.'"], [473, "463 ADDENDA. The following additions, kindly supplied by Professor Marcou, omitted in their proper place, are here inserted as addenda : Page 187, line 20, to be added : The Geological examination of Trinidad begun in 1855 and was sin shed in 1858. The final report, by G. P. Wall and J. G. Sawkins, was issned in 1860. It contains a \"Geological Map of Trinidad,\" scale 1 inch to 4 miles. Then the Geological examination of Jamaica occu pied the geologist in charge from 1859 to 1865. The pirsonnel numbered five, including the director, J. G. Sawkins. The final report was issued in 1869. It contains a large \"Geological Map of Jamaica by Sawkins and Brown,\" scale 1 : 253,440, or one mile to one-fourth of an inch. Finally, the geologists of the West Indies division were transferred to British Guiana, in November, 1867, first under Sawkins, as director, until June, 1870, then afterward, and until the end of the work in 1873, under C. Barring ton Brown as director, and the only explorer; several reports were published at Georgetown, Demerara, in large 4\u00b0 form. The final report appeared in London in 1875. It contains a \"Geological Map of Brit ish Guiana,\" by C. B. Brown, 1873, scale 1 inch to 13.6 geographical miles; a large sheet, which is most important for the geology of the South American continent. Page 188, line 22, to be added : A new general geological map, entitled \" Map of the Dominion of Canada, geologically colored from surveys made by the Geological Corps, 1842 to 1882,\" scale 1 inch to 40 miles, in two very large sheets, has been published in 1884 by Alfred R. C. Selwyn and G. M. Daw son. It was issued on the occasion of the meeting of the \" British Association for the Advancement of Science,\" at Montreal, in August, 1884. See page 15 for a statement of the very important labors of Prof. Jules Marcou, by means of which so complete a description of the Government geologic works has been made possible. These works, which in all European governments are conducted entirely separate from the topographic or great gen eral survey of the country, it had only been my intention to touch upon incidentally (except for the principal countries of Europe, where personal inspection was possible or official memoirs had been fur nished), being as surveys when compared with the topographic, more in the nature of auxiliary under takings; but the generous assistance of Professor Marcou (than whom no one was better able, on account of experience and library facilities, to furnish data) led to the expansion of this branch of information, which should prove of no little advantage to the Government in its further prosecution of geologic researches."], [474, "UNITED STATES. Topographic. The areaof the United States is approximately 3,025,600 square miles, with a population in 1880 of 50,155,983, or at an average of less than 17 to the square mile. CIVIL DIVISIONS. The United States is composed of 38 States, 8 organized Territories, the Indian Territory, the Territory of Alaska (purchased from Russia in 1877), and one District (Columbia). MILITARY DIVISIONS. For purposes of military administration the area of the United States is divided into three military divisions (each commanded by a major-general) and further subdivided into eight military departments (each commanded by a brigadier-general) . The measures of the United States are the same as those of Great Britain; the metric system was, however, made permissive by act of July 28, 1866. No general topographic survey on a trigonometric basis for the entire United States has yet been inaugurated. Each special work has been so far the outgrowth of specified wants. ORIGIN' Instrumental topography by the United States may be considered as having first begun, after the acquisition of territory west of the Mississippi River, with the expedition, in 1804-'5-'6, of the Army officers, Lewis and Clarke, from the valley of the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean.

The subdivision of the public lands has proceeded without interruption, and from the Land Office plats certain planimetric detail is gathered, wbich is of service for a general outline map. Between 1857 and 1880 the Land Office has conducted the sur vey of twenty four boundary lines between States and Territories (see Vol. I, Geo graphical Report), thus affording lines and points upon wbich to check up certain of the positions of the subdivision rectangles of the public land sy?stem. The geological undertakings west of tbe Mississippi River since tbe war by this Department, while producing a certain grade of topographic results, are more geologic in character, and bence will be mentioned under that head. No organization for the prosecution of systematic general topographic surveys exists in the United States. The Geological Survey, by virtue of the words of an appropriation act, \"to continue the preparation of a Geo logical Map of the United States,\" prosecutes throughout the country where ever its director may select such class of topography as is needed for this little accurate branch of science. This clause would seem to continue some-"], [477, "467 UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. thing which by law had never before been begun, i. e., a \"Geological Map of the United States.\" The natural and necessary inferiority of all topography directed by geologists (independent of the fact that they as a class are not capable or skilled in the exact or mathematical sciences that must be employed in the field observations and map construction) arises from the condition that the inherent requirements of geological investigation demand more attention to natural features of a given area than to the means of communication through and over it, or its economic or artificial details. The first consideration alone ought to satisfy as to the absolute impropriety of confiding topography to the geologist, and indeed it is only in the United States that geologists have presumed to arrogate its control, while to the credit of the profession be it said that the claim is confined, as is believed, to a few geologists in Gov ernment employ. The Coast Survey, organized for the hydrographic survey of the ocean coasts, has of late years been engaged, in addition thereto, in making a special belt of triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel, connecting that of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and furnishing points in aid of State surveys. This latter work, highly valuable from a purely scientific point of view, especially in ascertaining the relation of the mean level of the two oceans at this latitude, would appear to have no direct practical advantage other than that of aid to the States. The Lake Survey, organized in 1841 for the double purpose of furnish ing navigation charts for the Great Lakes and to determine the improve ments necessary to aid in the development of the commerce of these interior waters, has completed in a period of 40 years its field duties, and having performed the mission assigned it has finally closed its labors. The Mississippi River Commission now gathers many topographical details contiguous to this stream. ORGANIZATION. Prior to the enactment (1879) establishing the present Geological Sur vey various temporary organizations under the Interior Department had been operating for a number of years subsequent to the War of the Rebel lion, in the far West, known as the Geological Survey of the Territories,"], [478, "468 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. of the Rock}r Mountain Region, and also the Black Hills, all the topography of wliich was controlled by the theoretical requirements of the geologist. The geological exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, under the Engineer Department, was based on similar considerations; but the Geographical Sur veys west of the 100th meridian, proceeded in an entirely different manner, giving due weight to the astronomic, trigonometric, and topographic observa tions, with map delineations of all natural objects, means of communication, artificial and economic features, the geologic and natural history branches being treated as adjunctive to the main requirement of the War Department, .. e., Topography. The above is the only organized, systematic, general topographic work on a sound practical basis ever begun by the United States. When its organization (consisting of officers of Engineers and of the Army, civilian assistants, general service and other enlisted men, clerks, messen gers, &c.) had been brought to a high state of efficiency through training and experience, the appropriations (of which, as a class, the War Department had had the jurisdiction for over three-quarters of a century) were sus pended on account, as is believed, of persistent unjust adverse claims set up by certain geologists and others in the name of science. In the closing hours of a session (transferred in conference from the Legislative to the Sundry Civil Bill\u2014 see Cong. Record, No. 64, March 4, 1879, p. 61, and No. 67, March 7, 1879, pp. 41 and 42) the enabling act for the Geological Survey became a law, the vastly more important work of topography was thus put aside and left unprovided for, and the services of experienced Government engineers lost to this latter duty, the result of which has been a plain and positive step backward hitherto without precedent throughout the civilized world. The Corps of Topographical Engineers is the only body ever organ ized by law in the United States to prosecute topographic surveys. After a separate existence of exactly fifty years, they were merged with the present Corps of Engineers, March 3, 1863. No Department of the Gov ernment is now actually prepared to take up the complete topographic survey of the United States without time for preparation and the securing and training of the requisite personnel. Fine topographers are and always will be rare."], [479, "UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 469 The varied and irregular administration of works of exploration and survey by the United States, except for the interior topographic operations conducted almost without interruption under the War Department until 1879, will be seen by the following statement: War Department. \u2014 Examinations and surveys for roads and canals, specifically appropriated for between 1811 and 1864; same for improve ments of rivers and harbors (1819-1885) ; for surveys for military defenses (1823-1875) ; military and geographical surveys west of the Mississippi River (1841-1880) ; survey of Northern Lakes (1841-1885) ; Pacific Rail road surveys (1853-1856) ; geological exploration of Fortieth Parallel (1867-1873) ; geographical surveys west of 100th Meridian (1872-1879) ; surveys of Mississippi River since 18.9 ; explorations and reconnaissances by Engineer officers at headquarters military divisions and departments, and surve}7s of military reservations.

Interior Department. \u2014 Since this administrative branch was established its custody of the public lands has brought within its jurisdiction the sub division linear surveys required to mark the legalized tracts prior to their \u2022disposition to settlers, as well as usually the survey of Indian reservations and boundaries between States and Territories. Between 1844 and 1852 several geologic explorations of public mineral lands were authorized by Congress under the auspices of the Interior Department after the latter was organized ; but all geological work (unless thereafter specially authorized by law) was prohibited by act of July 21, 1852. The functions of the Geo logical Survey of the Territories, the Geological and Geographical Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region, and Exploration of the Black Hills, dictated in the main by the chiefs of these expeditions, consisted in a geological exploration or reconnaissance of various regions west of the Mississippi River, selected apparently on account of their interest from a geologic, mineralogie, or scenic point of view ; they have been replaced by the pres ent Geological Survey, which will be found separately mentioned. That part of the Smithsonian Institution devoted to collections finally merged into a National Museum, and also the Bureau of Ethnology, while not in any true or absolute sense connected with the national surveys, yet have been incidentally an outgrowth therefrom, the Museum having origi nated from the requirement of preserving collections from Government expeditions, and Ethnology being an offshoot from one of the geological works. The above, as will be seen, are one and all specific in character"], [482, "472 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. and limited to given and partial areas, except the Geological Survey, in case it should prove that the Government actually intends, in face of the fact that the far more important general topographic survey has not yet been begun, to fully authorize, in advance thereof, a geological examination of the whole country. The methods followed in the several classes of observations required by the different Government survey offices can best be under stood by reference to their published works. It may be said, however, that these have varied greatly, and have been dominated in the main by the grade of results required. The astronomic determinations by the Coast and Lake and War Department Geographical Surveys have been of the highest order of value, as also the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the Coast and Lake Surveys. The later triangulation of the Geograph ical Survey, dictated by the requirements of rapid and extended results, needs only revision work here and there to adjust it to any general scheme of triangulation for the whole country. The so-called triangulation of the geologic works west of the Mississippi is faulty, in that the resultant posi tions are nearly all dependent on graphic construction. Topographic methods over extensive areas in the United States are yet in an inchoate state and leave much to be practically desired before they can be carried to the degree of completeness demanded in thickly settled Europe, where more time and cost can be spent. It should be remarked, however, that wherever topography is under taken in the older States its grade should be as high as the best that has yet been done in Europe. Unfortunately (judging from the testimony before the joint Congressional committee), this does not prove to be true in that being executed by the U. S. Geological Survey in-, and for, the State of Massachusetts, as an illustration. There is nothing yet officially pub lished by the above office, except the assertions of the director (who is not an authority in astronomy, geodesy, or topography as applied to surveys), indicating the true value of any results in these three branches of its work as at present prosecuted for the purpose of obtaining the topographic base upon which to illustrate its geology.

Anticipating somewhat the memoir on Government surveys prepared for Vol. I (Geographical Report), and incidental to the elucidation of this great subject, still largely in embryo, in the United States, the following condensed statement is herewith made: The organization, methods, and results of all Government surveys should be held subordinate to the administrative or industrial requirement or specified want. Iu the main the Government should be actuated by the requirements of the Executive Depart ments, in which is lodged the jurisdiction over operations that demand surveys for"], [486, "476 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. their intelligent prosecution. Workers iu the various scientific branches required in these surveys should be made to bend their endeavors to immediate practical ends, which, if not done, tends to foster a patronage of science by the Government, than which nothing could be less conducive to its true progress or more inimical to the interests of the Government in this regard. No organization for survey duties alone fixed by law as to numbers is needed, and all present and future surveys can be made by the permanent and trained officers of the military and naval services, associated with deserving civilians. Although the advantages of concentrating all survey duties in the hands of one organization are many, yet they are exceeded in importance by the certain danger of this one organization becoming in time farther aud farther removed from the practical wants of any Department of the Government, and finally superior to the purposes for which it was created. The works inaugurated should therefore be classified aud administered according to their nature and the objects sought, and not by the means and men put in requisition for their execution. THE MEASURE. The general object or purpose for which a survey is to be made having been decided upon, the measure comprises, (1) the grade or class; (2) the Department controlling jurisdiction; (3) the plan with estimate of aggregate cost; (4) the subsequent annual projects with accompanying estimates; (5) the methods employed with regulations thereunder; (0) detailed field and office instructions; and (7) the limit as to time for the accomplishment of each class or kind of result. The above are to be applied in each of the three great natural divisions of Government surveys, i. e., (1) topographic (becoming geographic when accompanied by examinations in mineralogy, geology, and other branches of natural history); (2) hydrographic or marine; (3) cadastral or reve nue, including all subdivisions of lands The term \"topographic\" (herein used in its most comprehensive sense) includes a variety of methods, all requiring that the principles of geodesy shall be observed in the measurements of bases and subsequent triangulation, with initial points astro- nomically determined as original points of departure. The surveys that properly come under this head are, (1) detailed topographic surveys looking to the \"common defense\" (interior, along international boundaries and coastwise); (2) of sites for fortifications; (3) of localities of river and harbor and other internal improvements that should include a network of lines, trigonometrically based and carefully measured, covering the area of all the navigable waters of the United States, establishing latitudes and longitudes with the requisite number of altitudes resulting from levels of precision, with mean- ders and cross-sections, and proper topographic and hydrographic details of all navi- gable coast and stream lines upon which to base a complete connected and permanent system of improvements (by a slight development of the belts of triangles thus required points may be established in aid of State surveys, at least one for each county in each State, and the trigonometric extension serve as the initial basis of the great general topographio survey of the country) ; (4) of the lengths of rail and common roads, canals, and watercourses, over which the United States transports its troops, mails, material, aud supplies; (5) topographic surveys iu detail of the public domain west of the Mis- sissippi for military and other purposes, and incidentally the agricultural classification of the public lands not yet subdivided, and to include where required additional mean ders of new routes, all finally to be availed of for and merged into a great general"], [487, "477 UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. topographic survey of the whole country. It is needless to add that no such impor tant works can be successfully prosecuted with the highest attainable vigor and pre cision, except under a rigorous military administration. The preamble to the Constitution makes it one of the primal purposes of the Gov ernment to \"provide for the common defense,\" aud carries with it the authority there for, while a wise policy based on the axiom \" in time of peace prepare for war\" should actuatethe Government to systematically engage in the construction of permanent works of defense, and adopt all aids, accessories, and auxiliaries thereto. The hydrographic surveys are in aid of navigation, and incidentally facilitate and promote commerce. Surveys for the latter, however, are and ought to be made by the Engineers, who subsequently construct the improvement. Most of the original general hydrographic work for our sea coast has been accomplished. The grade of tbe survey is to be largely determined by tbe accuracy aud detail of the results required, and while tbe basis upon which the survey rests should be attained by the best means of measurement, the devices employed for securing the minuter portions of the data must vary within wide limits. Whatever the executive organization for the survey parties, the administration of the work should be intrusted to the Department having tbe most immediate, complete, aud permanent use for the results, thus securing the most vigilant supervision. In event of f< Teign war or domestic revolt, rebelliou, or revolution, whether the invaders approach by sea or land, the orig inal data upon whicb is based the special or general topographic map should be under the control of the War Department, whicb then becomes at once the most important branch of the Government, necessarily planning and directing tbe principal opera tions; and in case of approaches by sea the same applies with equal force to tbe Navy Department, as regards the hydrographic data of tbe coast and its approaches, and for the above requirement alone tbe present Coast Survey (tbat is, its hydrographic part) should be prosecuted under tbe Navy Department. The nature of the requirements of the Administrative Departments appears in the following table: No. Name of Department.

THE MEN. After the available number of trained officers of the Government belonging to the military and naval services is exhausted, it is comparatively unimportant who shall he called upon to assist in making the Government surveys, provided means are taken to select individuals whose professional attainments are of a high order and whose special training eminently fits them for the work. Numbers of competent men are regularly educated and trained at the Government expense at the Military aud Naval Academies, from whom selections are aud can be made, while those of the civil list have usually been educated at the scientific or technical schools of the couutry, or have had like elementary training iu foreign lauds. The military and naval services represent all quarters of the Union, and enjoy ing practically a life tenure, are more likely to hold the iuterests of the Government equally, if not more, sacred than their own, and more aptly find that time for study and reflection so necessary to the development of great schemes of survey. The available number is, however, comparatively limited. Not a few competent civilians have been trained in the practical schools of the Coast and Lake Surveys and the later Geographical Surveys west of the Mississippi, while any deficiency can readily be filled by the graduates of the civil scientific schools of the country. The organized personnel so far regularly employed by the Government in its mathematical surveys have been: (1) The Corps of Engineers (and prior to the consolidation act of 1863, the Corps of Topographical Eugiueers) regularly and also by detail upon the topographical parts of the survey of the coast. (See Title 50, Eev. Stat.) (2) Officers by detail from the Ordnance, Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry. (3) Officers of the Navy as called upon and by detail upon the hydrographic parts of the survey of the coast. (4) Astronomers and others of the Coast, Lake, and Geographical Survey. (5) Surveyors general and their deputies, who are to be \" skillful surveyors,\" and coutract surveyors of the Interior Department. The number available for selection from the above sources, excepting, perhaps, the fifth, can readily be kept employed. The scope and extent of their duties should be, however, defined with the utmost precision by law. As the surveys of the inland portions of the United States are practically as yet iu their infancy, as compared with those of foreign nations, it is safe to expect that they will be extended over continuous intervals following systematic plans, and hence a personnel of skilled men will be required whose number will naturally increase and whose tenure should be made as permanent as practicable. THE RESULTS. The results of the laud surveys are accomplished when the approved plats of the subdivisions reaches the General Land Office and the patent in accordance therewith is issued. These surveys have alone a practical mission to fulfill, and are not, nor should they be, performed with any special pretense of gnat scientific accuracy.

All the map data constitutes a substantial contribution to the great future topo graphic maj) of the United States that it will take generations to complete, aud the jurisdiction over wliich should be confined to a single branch of the Government, instead of being distributed, as at present. The final maps and systematic reports, other than the annual reports of operations, should be published in departmental edi tions of 2,000 copies each, with such additional number as Congress may order in special instances. Authority of law should be granted for the sale of the maps and reports at cost price, and the Bureau organization supervising the surveys should be directed to con tract with business establishments for their convenient sale. The same should apply to the published results of the Hydrographic or Marine Surveys and the Geological investigations. The Hydrographic Surveys should likewise present their final results in a series of systematically arranged Coast Charts upon a projection convenient for navigators, with the usual reports devoted to such scientific investigations iuto methods as long continued and reported experiments may develop. This is especially appli cable to the Geographical aud Topographical Surveys. There would thus result three sets of scientific and practical reports: (1) From the Geographical and Topographical Survey, in relation to admeasurements upon land; (2) from the Hydrographic Survey, in reference to measurements iu aud offshore and upon the adjacent coasts and in the deep sea; and (3) the Geological aud Mineralogical discussious resulting from the examination of the geological structure and mineral resources of the public domain.

The law should define the proper co-ordination and co operation of and between the several Departments of the Government in the prosecution of their works of survey. The Great General Survey of the country is both a practical and scientific measure, and belongs to the domain of exact science, aud should be withdrawn entirely from the field of theoretical science, or it can never be carried to a successful conclusion. This view, while absolutely correct as regards the interests of the Government, is also in favor of the best and most permanent recognition of the true and earnest workers in the theoretical branches of science. By act of June 30, 1878, Congress called upon the National Academy of Sciences \"to take into consideration the methods and expense of conducting all surveys of a scientific character under the War and Interior Departments and the surveys of the Land Office, and to report to Congress * * * a plan for survey ing and mapping the Territories of the United States on such general system as will in their judgment secure the best results at the least possible cost.\" Their report appears as Seu. Mis. Doc. No. !J, 45th Congress, 3d session. It ignores \"methods and expense\" aud fails to present u a plan for surveying and mapping the Territories of the United States\"; but proceeds to make a recommendation as to what shall be done with the then existing organizations. Based on this move the present Geological Survey was established. By act of July 7, 1884, there was established a joint Congressional Commission to con sider the present organization of the Signal Service, Geological Survey, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Hydrographic Office, with the view to secure greater efficiency and economy of administration of the public service in said Bureaus. Ou July 9, 1884, this Commission called on the National Academy of Sciences for a report on the subject-matter of the above act, suggesting the following points for consideration: 1. What is the organization of the Government Surveys* and of the Signal Service iu the chief countries of Europe, and could any part of this organization be advan tageously adopted in this country? 2. In what way can the scientific branches above referred to be best co ordinated? 3. What changes in or additions to these branches are desirable1? The reply of the committee of the National Academy refers to Comstock's \"Notes on European Surveys,\" reiterates its recommendation of 1878, hitherto referred to, and proceeds to recommend, in case a \" Department of Science\" cannot be created, that all the Bureaus be transferred to some one Executive Department, and placed under four Bureaus, as follows: 1. The Coast aud Interior Survey, to be concerned principally with geodesy and hydrography, and to consist of the present Coast and Geodetic Survey. 2. The Geological Survey, to comprise the present Geological Survey, with its organization unchanged. 3. The Meteorological Bureau, to which should be transferred so much of the pres ent personnel and functions of the Chief Signal Office as are not necessary to the mili tary duties of that office. 4. A physical observatory to investigate the laws of solar and terrestrial radia tion and their application to meteorology, with such other investigations inexact science * A complete answer as to the European Governmeut Survey organizations is found herein. 1366 WH 31"], [492, "482 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. as the Government might assign it. It also recommends a commission (of exalted powers) to supervise everything proposed by each head of the above Bureaus. The whole leaves the Government as much in the dark as ever as to what surveys actually it should make and how they should be made, and how confined aud defiued aud made one tangible whole. A brief statement will be made of the status of the principal special works of survey that have latterly contributed through the General Govern ment to furnish the topographic, hydrographic, and geologic data in the United States, while in my response to \"Organizing Committee\" will be found a brief mention of the State surveys in progress. The graphic results of the works so far conducted can best be understood by reference to \"Lists of Maps,\" pp. 138 and 139. It never having been the practice of the General Government to levy a tax upon land, there is no requirement on its part for a cadastral survey; the latter, whenever undertaken, must be subject to the State or municipal authority, except for the 10 miles square of the District of Columbia, the supreme jurisdiction over which rests with Congress. TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS. War Department (Corps of Engineers). SURVEY OF THE NORTHERN AND NORTHWESTERN LAKES. This work was begun in 1841 and the final field-work completed in 1881.* It had the double object of furnishing reliable charts for lake vessels and of determining the improvements necessary to the prosperity of lake commerce, which caused Congress to direct a survey of the lakes, for which appropriations were annually made to the close, except for the year 1847. An idea of the magnitude of the work may be gained from the following, taken from General Comstock's final report, page 2 : The American shore-line of the Great Lakes and their connecting rivers, if meas ured in steps of 25 miles, is about 3,000 miles, but if the indentations of the shore and * This work may be considered as a trigonometrically based topographic aud hydrographic survey, both scientific and practical in its character, be'mg systematic as regards surveys looking to the per manent improvement of the Lake harbors, which for convenience has been placed under the heading \"Laud Surveys.\""], [493, "483 UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPJGRAPHIC. the outlines of the islands be included, the developed shore-line is about 4,700 miles in length. Along rivers and where a lake is narrow, it is necessary for navigation that both shores be mapped. This increases the length of the shore-line to be sur veyed between Saint Regis, N. Y., aud Duluth, Minn., to 6,000 miles. The officer in charge at the close of the work was Bvt. Brig. Gen. C. B. Comstock, Corps of Engineers. The work throughout has been in charge of the Government military engineers, commencing with an office at Buffalo, under the old Corps of Topographical Engineers and terminating, with office at Detroit, under the present Corps of Engineers, into which the Topographical Engineers were merged in 1863. During the earlier years the assistants were almost exclusively officers of engineers, but as the scope of the work enlarged and fewer officers of engineers were available, it became necessary to substitute the services of civilians to some extent. During the first 10 years, although a geodetic survey was contemplated, the actual operations were confined to special localities needing immediate improvement, while subsequently the entire work was based on a rigid triangulation of the highest known order of accuracy, referred to carefully measured bases, the whole checked by initial astronomical determinations; while the triangulation was only incidental to the survey, it was measured with the greatest precision that it might serve to aid in a more accurate determination of the actual form and dimensions of the theoretic terrestrial spheroid. Thus a principal triangulation with an axial distance of 1,300 miles from Duluth, Minn., via Chicago, to the eastern shore of Lake Ontario, and also a continuous chain from Saint Ignace Island ou the north shore of Lake Superior to a point in Southern Illinois, a distance of about 10 degrees in lati tude, has been established. Where necessary for the support of the detailed surveys a secondary and tertiary net of triangles have been determined. The amount appropriated for this work entire to June 30, 1886, has been $2, 951,379, a small part of which has been devoted to the survey of the Mississippi River. Of the amount appropriated, $2,907,850.14 had been expended up to June 30, 1882.* The work is now substantially finished, the * General Cemstock reports the cost per square mile for complete triangulation, topography, inshore and offshore hydrography (for seven years ending June 30, 1878), at $22, $151, $68, and $42. respectively, and the cost for a square mile covered by triangulation and topography (or mapping) $173.

Independent of the regular annual reports of operations (submitted either to the Chief of Topographical Engineers, or to the Chief of Engineers) and the final report upon the primary triangulation (professional papers, Corps of Engineers, No. 24) there have been issued 7y charts at scales from 1 : 5,000 to 1 : 600,000.

These, as before stated, have been carried on at different intervals and with varying degrees of activity since this territory was acquired in the commencement of the present century.

Reports, Vol. XI) brings their history down to 1857, and in Volume I of quarto reports, Geographical Surveys, will be found a continuation to 1880, if not later,, hy myself. The works since the war have been the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel (King),* Explorations and reconnais sances at headquarters military divisions and departments, and the Geo graphical Surveys west of the 100th Meridian (Wheeler),* the latter for want of funds being now engaged only in completing publications. The total appropriations thus far made available for these works have aggregated approximately $1,473,667.73. Under the Engineer Department are carried on also the multiple works of survey at special localities throughout the United States preliminary to and incident upon improvement of the national waterways, and especially the survey of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, upon which to base a permanent system of improvement to the navigation of that large and important waterway. Tbe amounts appropriated for examinations and surveys, preparatory to the work of improvement, to June 30, 1886, has been found to be $2,393,574.05, of which $2,043,457.05 had been expended up to June 30, 1882. The amount annually appropriated (of current date) for examinations and surveys by the Mississippi River Commission has been $150,000. \"Theso will bo found treated under separate heads."], [495, "485 UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. Incidental to the construction of fortifications and works of defense, the Engineer Department has made special surveys of sites thereof and approaches thereto, at varying scales and degrees of minuteness. As well, this branch of the public service is called upon for the sur veys required for military wagon-roads, boundaries, the survey of military reservations, battle-fields, &c, the results of wliich appear in the regular annual reports of the Chief of Engineers. The Engineer Department keeps constantly revised a military map of the Western Territories (scale 1 : 2,000,000) and of the United States (scale 1 : 5,000,000). GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEYS WEST OF THE 100TH MERIDIAN. (Corps of Engineers.) This work was the outgrowth of the topographical reconnaissance sur vey of Lieutenant (now Captain) Wheeler, Corps of Engineers, in 1869, while serving at the headquarters Military Department of California. This officer submitted during the winter of 1871-72 a plan for a systematic topo graphical survey of the area of the United States west of the 100th Meridian (1,443,360 square miles), at a total approximate expense of $2,500,000, which, being approved by the Chief of Engineers and Secretary of War, went before the Committee of Appropriations, was then adopted, and the first appropriation granted June 10, 1872. The work was continuously prosecuted in pursuance of said plan so long as appropriations were made. Its organization consisted of officers of Engineers and of the Army, civilian assistants, computers, and draughtsmen, general service and other enlisted men, clerks, messengers, &c. Its administration was continuously under the War Department. Its functions, other than those germane to the topographic maps, as the initial astronomic work, measured bases, trigono metric extension and hypsometric work upon which the topography was based, consisted in field observations and office reductions in the branches of Mineralogy, Geology, Paleontology, Zoology, Botany, Arch\u00e6ology, &c, and reports on each of these subjects have been published. The methods employed and general description of the whole work will appear in Vol. I of forthcoming reports."], [496, "486 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS.

The total cost to the Government (including all aid and supplies) for this work, embracing instrumental topography over an area of 359,065 square miles, was $618,644.05. While the pretentious claim has been made (see p. 17, testimony before Congres sional Commission) that this work was consolidated with the present Geo logical Survey, yet this is not true in fact. It ceased to exist for want of funds for its prosecution, hence its personnel was dispersed to other spheres of usefulness, while its original records, one and all, were transferred to the Engineer Department upon closing the office. It is needless to add that there is no danger of its conception, plan, and mode of execution being absorbed into or combined with any work controlled and directed from the standpoint of theoretical science."], [497, "UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 487 SUBDIVISION OF THE PUBLIC LANDS. (General Land Office, Department of the Interior.) Shortly after several of the thirteen original States ceded parts of their outlying lands to the General Government, surveys became necessary to mark the tracts with which title was parted. The legal subdivisions during and since 1803 have been in accordance with a system devised and per fected by Lieutenant-Colonel Mansfield, Corps of Engineers, then professor of philosophy at West Point, who for a time became the sole and single Surveyor-General. The system consists briefly of the division of so many degrees of latitude and longitude into townships, theoretically 6-mile squares, but practically containing only approximately this area, because of con vergency of meridians and varying lengths of parallels at different latitudes. Each of these townships is divided into 36 sections, each of which in turn is divided into 4 quarters of approximately 160 acres each. It was orig inally intended to check up by astronomical determinations of points at township corners or on the main standards or parallels, but the rapidity of settlement has usually called for only detailed subdivision work, and the checks, it is to be regretted, have not been as frequent as might be desired from a purely scientific point of view. However, the requirement of the Government is purely a practical one, and the sections of country within which it takes place, having been usually remote from civilization, where skilled talent cannot, as a rule, be found, it has answered admirably the practical need of frontier settlements; and gradually, as initial points be come more numerous, a greater accuracy and less danger of propagation of error can be attained. Only horizontal measurements are made, hence the topographic details secured are not connected and only superficial ; however, the material gathered is of value in the preparation of prelimi- nary field maps for topographic purposes and for the compilation of a general planimetric map of the United States (without reliefs), which has been completed, and is constantly undergoing revision by this office. The cost of this surveying or demarking process is shown by the state ment that $25,649,195.09 had been appropriated to June 30, 1886, with an"], [498, "488 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. actual expenditure to June 30, 1879, of approximately $23,672,606.* The current annual appropriation is approximately $350,000. Independent of the general maps of the United States compiled by the Engineer Department and the General Land Office, the Post-Office Depart ment compiles and constantly revises a series of postal charts, which in the aggregate comprise all the States and Territories. Latterly the Coast Survey, it is understood, has commenced the compilation of a general map of the United States, which with that of the geological survey lately taken up, makes no less than 5 distinct and separate general maps of the country. Therefore as one reflects upon the large amount of Government map ping in the United States for the past 15 or 20 years, it would appear that my remarks upon this class of Government productions in France, .. e., that there are \"more map makers than material for making maps,\" would seem to apply with greater force to the United States, where unlike France (the latter having the elaborate topographic survey of the War Department as a basis upon which to build), our Government has never yet had material for a satisfactory general topographic map of any one of the older States even, much less of its territory entire. The Light-House Board of the Treasury Department makes its own surveys for sites and issues a set of compiled charts showing the position and power of the various light-houses, beacons, &c. The railroads of the country (present or prospective) have all contrib uted more or less detailed material, especially in the form of profiles; al though not interested in the establishment of any geographical co-ordinates of points of their lines, their plats prove of but little geographical value ex cept where checked by interposed stations from more systematic surveys. Thus the United States, although it has accomplished much in the comparatively short period of its Constitutional Government, has yet before it a work of great magnitude, to be performed by some branch of the General Government; in fact nothing less than the Great General Topo graphical survey of the whole country, to be executed ii* whole or part by the General Government with such assistance for minor details as the various States iu turn may be willing and able to accord. * The cost estimated by the General Land Office to June 30, 1*S5, including that for offices of Surveyors-General, is $31,500,408.74, an average of 3\u00a3 cents per acre for the survey."], [499, "UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. 489 GENERAL ATLAS OF THE UNITED STATES. This sketch was prepared by myself prior to a personal knowledge of the India atlas or any of the European topographic survey series of maps, as one well adapted for an atlas to be compiled as soon as the various kinds of special surveys or a general topographic work furnished the necessary material. The modified secant conic projection admitting of conjoining sheets, the same as that employed for the atlas west ofthe 100th Meridian, was selected, which will be found described in Vol. I, Geographical Report. It is here introduced for the purpose of showing the locus of the various surveys of the General Government, more particularly of a topographic character, and also that of the Adirondack region, the only State topo graphic survey now in progress. The explanatory notes should be con sulted in order to trace the works of survey in progress upon the coast and throughout the interior. For the data upon which a complete atlas shall be finally based see table on p. 480, indicating the \"Future surveys that will be required by the Government of the United States,\" and also special Government surveys herein described. By far the largest single connected surveyed area yet available for the purposes of such an atlas is that embraced by Geographical Surveys west of the 100th Meridian (359,065 square miles), which, although prosecuted at small cost, simpty as a current aid to the administration of military affairs, in mountainous and desert regions infested by hostiles, nevertheless, for several decades, at least, will furnish all the practical topographic informa tion required by the Government and people in these thinly settled areas. With the necessary later revisions, as slowly-increasing settlement shall demand, it becomes of permanent value. The project for the above military topographic atlas was perfected by myself in 1875. Various circumstances (especially the temporarily success ful claim of certain geologists to the control of Government topographic map work) have conspired to delay its execution. It is believed, however, that a fair and temperate discussion of the merits of the proposition will result in placing Topography where it belongs, under the War Depart ment, and then this great practical work can and ought to be accomplished."], [500, "490 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS.

ADMINISTRATION. The administration of geological works has been both in the War and Interior Departments. The present work is conducted under the latter Department. GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF THE FORTIETH PARALLEL. This work, organized under the Engineer Department with Clarence King as chief, confined its labors to a narrow strip either side of the Pacific Railroad from Cheyenne, Wyo., on the east to the 120th Meridian on the west. Its objects included topography resting on an astronomic base, with graphically reduced triangulation, which, while artistically executed on the"], [502, "492 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. face of the resultant map, is deficient in actual check points, judging from the small number of published latitudes and longitudes. Like all topog raphy so far prosecuted under the direction- of geologists in the United States, it is faulty to the extent of placing more stress on the natural feat ures (especially orographic reliefs) than on the means of communication and economic or improvement details. The work as a whole is very valu able, especially from a geological point of view ; but, unfortunately, was to some extent the forerunner of a series of works by means of which cer tain Government officials engaged in the theoretical branch of geology have presumed to arrogate the control of the fundamental operations of a topo graphic survey, relegating the latter to such position of inferiority or obscurity as may suit the will or fancy of the geologist. This is a reversal of a true order of sequence based on professional and practical importance, which is unjustifiable from any standpoint, least of all from that of true science. The total area embraced, as shown by the resultant map, is 86,390 square miles, at a cost of $386,711.85. (For latter see House Ex. Doc. No. 88, 45th Cong., 2d sess.) The publications consist of seven quarto volumes, appendixes to the annual reports of the Chief of Engineers, and ten topographic and geologic maps in atlas form. (See p. 138.) GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE TERRITORIES. This work, begun under the General Land Office, on a small appro priation, in 1867, for the geological examination of Nebraska, continued during the succeeding eleven years, with a varying personnel, its labors spreading over much space, principally in the Territories west of the Mis sissippi. Its administration was continuously that of the Interior Depart ment. This work was in the nature of a reconnaissance until 1873, when more systematic topographic work was undertaken, upon wliich as a base the geologic edition of maps was issued. Herein also is found a similar deficiency in practical information upon the topographic sheets relating to routes and economic details, the natural features predominating to the par-"], [503, "493 UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. tial exclusion of the former. As a whole much information concerning our western Territories was added to the existing stock. As near as may be determined, the area covered topographically from 1873 to 1878, inclusive, was 107,000 square miles. The amounts appropri ated aggregate $713,825. There had been expended up to 1877 $619,001.68 (see House Ex. Doc. No. 81, 45th Congress, 2d sess.). The publications consist of 12 annual reports, 8\u00b0 (186.-1878), three of which were repub lished, and two others, preliminary, making 17 in all. Of bulletins (8\u00b0), there are six volumes, aggregating 27 individuals. There are 12 miscellaneous publications, 8\u00b0. When complete, there will be 12 volumes (4\u00b0) of monographs. The unclassified publications (18mo to folio) are 15 in number. The maps, other than those bound in with reports, are 19 topographic, 9 geologic, and 8 miscellaneous ; 20 of these appear in an Atlas of Colorado. GEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF EOCKY MOUNTAIN REGION. This work, commencing with a boat Exploration of the Canons of the Colorado, was continued (terminating in 1878) over areas in the basin of the Colorado River, finally embracing observations in topography. The administration was confided either directly to the Secretary of the Interior or through the Smithsonian Institution, with Mr. J. W. Powell in charge. The results are more particularly valuable from the geological and ethno logical points of view. So far as can be judged from the topographic maps, the base work for topography was insignificant ; at least very few, if any, latitudes and longitudes have been published. It is presumed that the results in hand when appropriations were suspended in 1879 have now gone into the office of the Geological Survey. The head of this work claims to have covered 67,000 square miles topographically. The amount appropriated has been $279,000. A list of publications furnished by the Director shows 7 octavo and 12 quarto publications, with 16 maps, mostly preliminary, or compiled from existing sources. This work, with others of like character, will be found treated in detail in appendix to Volume I (Geographical Report)."], [504, "494 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF THE BLACK HILLS. This expedition, originating under the Indian Office, commenced its operations in 1875, under Mr. W. P. Jenney, with Mr. H. E. Newton as assistant. Mr. Newton revisited the ground in 1877. The results may be found in three small octavo reports and one volume quarto, the latter appearing under the auspices of the Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region. The maps are both topographic and geologic, the latter based on the former. Each is on the scale of 1 inch to 4 miles, the former embracing, according to Mr. Gilbert, about 9,000 square miles and the latter about 10,000 square miles. The \"Atlas\" contains a third sheet, giving a bird's-eye view of the Hills. The amounts made available for this work aggregate $26,588.62. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. The law creating the office of Director of the Geological Survey was approved March 3, 1879, and Mr. Clarence King was the first incumbent. The following extract from the law serves to indicate the scope of the examination proposed : For tbe salary of tbe Director of tbe Geological Survey, wbicb office is bereby establisbed under tbe Interior Department, who shall be appointed by the President, by and with tbe advice and consent of the Senate, six thousand dollars: Provided, That tbis officer shall have the direction of the Geological Survey and the classifica tion of the public lands, and examination of tbe geological structure, mineral resources, aud products of the national domain. Under this law geological investigations have been prosecuted within the States and Territories over which the General Government has special jurisdiction because of public lands still held therein. Later legislation \u2014 in an appropriation act approved August 7, 1882 \u2014 provided for the \"prep aration \" of a Geological Map of the United States. Whether this carries with it the full and legal authority to prosecute field-work within the older States is not known. The personnel consisted (1884), in addition to the Director, of 262 persons, of various grades, among them being 71 geolo gists and assistant geologists, 63 topographers and assistant topographers, the balance being clerks, draughtsmen, photographer, &c. The law per-"], [505, "495 UNITED STATES\u2014 TOPOGRAPHIC. mits, within the discretion of the Secretary of War, of the detail of two Army officers. The following is the statute regarding publications : The publications of the Geological Survey shall consist of the annual report of operations, geological and economic maps illustrating the resources aud classifications of tbe lands aud reports upou general and economic geology and paleontology. The law provides, also, for the sale at cost of all publications. Twelve volumes, in quarto, of practical and general geology and paleontology were projected by and under Mr. King (see his first annual report). Of these, seven have already been published. Four Annual Reports (royal 8\u00b0) and 26 Bulletins have also been issued. It is under stood that special geological charts, independent of reports, are to be issued from time to time. The direct appropriations made by Congress to June 30, 1886, aggregate $2,012,360. The current annual appropriation is $503,240. The amount appro priated for geological examinations west of the Mississippi River, principally under the Interior Department, prior to the establishment of the Geological Survey, was $1,3'6, 802.47, which, together with the amount already appro priated for the Geological Survey, and the sum of $386,711.85, expended for the geological exploration of the 40th Parallel, under the Engineer Department, aggregates the sum of $3,755,874.32 as the approximate cost of this special class of work, embracing only those conducted separately, since 1834, and of which all except $337,*'. 80.85 has been available subse quent to the war of the rebellion. The Director claims an area of 184,200 square miles covered to close of 1884. It does not appear, however, that any topographic maps of any importance have so far been issued by this work. Three maps of areas in NeAV Mexico and Arizona have come to my notice that are not at all credit able. On December 19, 1885, no regular complete togographic map had been issued. (See testimony, Survey Commission, p. 689.) It may be assumed, however, that there are maps to be issued. There is nothing yet officially published by the above office, known to me, except the assertions of the Director, indicating the true value of any results in the above branches. It has been claimed by the Director of this"], [506, "496 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. work that the surveys of the War and Interior Departments, heretofore described, have been consolidated with the Geological Survey. The facts are, as regards geographical surveys west of 100th Meridian, that ostensibly and nominally this work was discontinued by an inoperative statute (the new legislation creating the Geological Survey thereby escaping the point of order in the House ot Representatives), the work itself only having been possible by virtue of an appropriation, which latter was not made. The personnel were disbanded and all official records transferred to the Engineer Department. It is not by any means clear that the present law authorizes a geologic and topographic survey of the whole country, although that appears to be the interpretation of the present Director. On the contrary, the \"preparation\" of a map is, strictly interpreted, only an office piece of work. It may be noticed that neither the words \"topographic\" or \"geographic\" appear in the law for the Geological Survey, while the latter word was by vote excluded from the organic act for the survey (see Cong. Record, No. 58, February 26, 1879). The authority for the topography executed by this work seems to rest on the requirement of a topographic base upon which to illustrate the geology. Surely if this requirement will warrant one topographic survey, those for military, economic, and other scientific purposes, would be a war rant for at least one hundred such surveys. While the geologic examina tion of a country, well conducted, is of exceeding value, its presence domi nating to the exclusion of more important undertakings is an anomaly alike detrimental to the interests of the Government and of science. The collections made by the above work are finally transferred to the National Museum. Ethnology as a separate investigation was first appro priated for in 18 1 9, and Mr. J. W. Powell (the 'Director of the Geological Survey succeeding Mr. King) has since been its Director. Unlike the history of every other civilized country, the Geological Survey in the United States has been given a legal status in advance of the vastly more necessary, important, and useful work, the Topographic Survey."], [507, "497 MARINE SURVEYS\u2014 INTRODUCTORY. MARIjNTE surveys. INTRODUCTORY. The information regarding the hydrographic surveys has been gathered incidentally while prosecuting the search for facts concerning works on land, and for want of means and time is necessarily meager and incomplete.

The administration of all works of Hydrographic Survey elsewhere than in the United States and in Portugal is found very properly in the Navy Department or Marine Min istries of the several Governments * In Portugal the topographic, geologic, and hydrographic surveys are under a single head.

Hydrographic. The hydrographic service of Great Britain is attached to the Admiralty, being under the direction of its First Lord, and presided over by the \"Hydrographer\" of the Navy, who was (1882) Capt. Fred. J. 0. Evans, R. N., K. C. B, F. R S. This officer is aided by 10 assistants (Naval officers), 2 others (civil ians), and 6 draughtsmen. Officers of the Navy are specially selected to supervise and prepare the publication of the book on lights, that con tains the tables of the world, and also sailing directions. The work is divided for convenience into several branches, as for charts, publications, pilotage duties, &c, and nothing is ever issued until it receives the indorsement from the officer in charge of each branch, passing finally the inspection of the chief naval assistant, and held subject to the approval of the hydrographer. The jurisdiction of this service covers home, colonial and foreign coasts (India having until now its own marine survey). The foreign sur veys are carried out exclusively by vessels specially assigned (cruising ships not being expected to make surveys), and receiving instructions from the hydrographer. There are no Government engravers attached to this office, a private establishment being contracted with for this work and for the care of the plates, of which there are a great number. The ruling idea is to publish accurate charts best suited for the uses of the navigator. The following extracts from Memoir of the Hydrographic Department of the British Admiralty serve to give an idea of the organization, duties, and functions of this office : The Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty is composed of naval officers, with the exception of the draughtsmen, who are civilians, appointed under the civil service code. The naval officers are not necessarily selected from any particular class or rank, but are chosen for their special aptitude for the duties they have to perform."], [510, "500 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The surveying service afloat varies in strength according to circumstances and the requirements of commerce and navigation. It is directly subordinate to the Hydro graphic Department, both being under the immediate control of the Board of Admi ralty. The surveys are carried on by either regular ships of war, specially fitted for that purpose, or by small hired vessels. The latter method is adopted where prac ticable with a view to economy. The functions of the Hydrographic Department are various as well as numerous. They are so diversified that it is not easy to enumerate them without entering into too much detail. The most important are to execute accurate surveys of all parts of the world which are visited by British ships, whether of war or commerce, and to pre pare aud publish these surveys in the form of charts; to write and publish nautical directions to accompany the charts ; to compute, prepare, and publish annually tide tables aud light-lists for all parts of the world ; to receive and take charge of all remark books from the captains and navigating officers of Her Majesty's ships, as well as information from all other nautical sources, home or foreign; to compile such informa tion and publish it promptly in the form of hydrographic notices of warnings of dan ger, in order that all charts and other nautical documents may be kept corrected up to the latest period. The hydrographer has the general superintendence of the whole department, aud is immediately responsible to the Board for the efficient performance of all the duties connected with it. He decides what surveys it is most necessary in the interest of navigation to undertake, and, with the sanction of the Board, makes the necessary preparation. He nominates the officers to be employed ou them, frames their instructions, provides the instruments and other means for carrying on the surveys, aud keeps up a constant correspondence with the several officers in command. Their work as com pleted is transmitted to him, and it is his duty to make the results immediately available and in such form as he may consider best for the interests of navigation. The chief naval assistant is a staff captain. The first civil assistant is a retired com mander. On one of the naval assistants devolves the duty of computing the tides. The time of two of the naval assistants is entirely devoted to the compilation and revision of books of nautical directions. One assistant is employed under the chief naval assistant in the preparation of physical charts of the different oceans, on which are shown graphically the prevailing winds, currents, temperature, and other meteorological phenomena bearing upon the facility of making ocean passages during different seasons. The remaiuing naval assistants perform duties of a miscellaneous but important character; among them that of curator of all the original documents in the department, amounting to about 40,000 ; entering and marking with particulars every original chart or other document that is received, and seeing that they are prop erly catalogued. The second civil assistant is a naval surveyor. The remaining civil assistant, who is a clerk in the civil branch of the Admiralty, and was transferred with the pilotage duties to the hydrographic office, is exclusively employed on those duties. The superintendent of compasses, and the officer associated with him, perform their duties partly at the hydrographic office and partly at the compass observatory at Woolwich. The superintendent of charts is a naval captain, and his duties are of a very important and responsible character. It is necessary that he should be an experienced practical surveyor as well as a good draughtsman. He has the imme"], [511, "501 GREAT BRITAIN -HYDROGRAPHIC. diate superintendence of the drawing-room and of the draughtsmen. The duties of the chief draughtsman are likewise important. He must have a thorough knowledge of the various projections and nautical problems involved in the construction of charts, and must necessarily be a draughtsman of a superior order. The present duties of the hydrographic office are, it is understood, the same as the above (1868) with slight exceptions. All the charts issued refer to the meridian of Greenwich and are on the Mercator projection. One officer is exclusively engaged in preparing the annual publication of the tide tables of the world, another has exclusive charge of the issue of charts and sailing instructions to all the ships afloat, and with keeping each and every one supplied with all new information; sextants and theodolites are supplied from the Hydrographic Bureau to surveying vessels only. The sextants required for the navigation of ships are furnished by the several navigating officers. Compasses are also supplied from this branch, while chronometers are issued under the direction of the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich. Ther mometers and barometers are supplied to all naval vessels from the Meteo rological Branch of the Board of Trade. A list of charts, maps, and other publications is issued with additions from year to year, and gives an idea of the magnitude and importance of this Hydrographic Office, which is probably the most extensive in the world. The Admiralty charts (numbering about 2,900) may be classed under five heads, viz : Ocean, general, and coast charts; harbor plans and physical charts. Soundings are reduced to mean low-water of ordinary spring tides, and are expressed in fathoms (6 feet) and fractions of a fathom, or in feet and fractions of a foot, such being denoted on the chart. The underlined figures on the dry banks represent (in feet or fathoms) either the depth over them at high water or the height of the banks above low water. The velocity of tide is expressed in whole or fractional parts of a knot, the period of the tide being shown in quarters. The rise of tide is measured from the mean low-water level of ordinary springs. The range is measured from the low of one tide to the high of the following tide. All heights are given in feet above high-water ordinary springs and above level of the sea at places without tides."], [512, "502 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. All bearings are magnetic except when otherwise expressed. Bearings of lights are given as seen from seaward and not from the lights. The geographical mile is usually defined as the length of a minute of arc of the earth's equator ; while the nautical or sea mile, as defined by hydrographers, is the length of a minute of the meridian, being different for every latitude. It is equal to a minute of arc of a circle whose radius is that of the curvature of the meridian at the latitude of the place. Length of a mean nautical or sea mile zn 6,076.91 feet or 2,025.63 yards, or 1.509 statute mile. Length of a geographical mile zz 1.5-9 statute mile. An Admiralty knot zz 6.080 feet or 2.026\u00a7 yards. A cable's length is assumed to be about one-tenth of a sea mile, or equal to about 100 fathoms. The current work (1882) was the revising surveys of home coasts and harbors, correcting and completing the surveys of Newfoundland, extending elaborate surveys along the coast of Labrador to Hudson's Straits, having reproduced and published the shores of Jamaica. Extensive surveys of the east coast of Africa, north and south of Zanzibar, were also in progress. Surveys of the inner channels between the Straits of Magellan and the Pacific were being prosecuted. The surveys of the coasts and waters of Australia were being extended to the coast of New Guinea, and surveying vessels were being employed among the South Sea Islands, especiall}- the Fiji group. GERMANY. Hydrographic. Accurate and detailed surveys of the entire German sea coasts are made wholly by the Hydrographic Bureau (Hydrographisches Amt ) of the Admi ralty, and charts are published at Hamburg.

The Chief of the Admiralty has supreme direction and can arrange the interior organization of the Admiralty as he deems best."], [513, "GERMANY\u2014 HYDROGR A PHIC. 503 The following, being a translation by Lieutenant Bechler, U. S. Navy, and kindly furnished by Lieutenant R P. Rodgers, Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence refers to organization and duties: The Hydrographic Bureau, with a naval captain as chief, is charged with duties divided as follows : 1. Surveys aud cartography, sailing directions, nautical information, pilotage, lights and beacons, personnel aud quarters of the persons of pilots, light-ships, light houses, and fog-signal stations; damages and nautical affairs concerning both the Imperial navy and merchant marine; rules for avoiding collisions at sea; pilot and distress signals ; letter-post station at Wilhelmshaven ; management of the general military chest accouuts, &c. 2. Surveys, geodetic and astronomic ; position reckonings, sailing directions, pilotage ; beacons aud lights. 3. Providing charts, plans, views of coasts, &c, and the copper plates, wood cuts, and lithographic work. 4. Collection and compilation of nautical letters and advices; publication of the \"Annalen der Hydrographic,\" &c, aud \" Nachrichten fur Seefahrer\" (notices to mar iners), and \" Leuchtfeuervcrzeichuisse \" (light-house notices). 5. Books, charts, and periodical collections, with correction of the charts, and sailing directions based upon this collection. The business of the Chart Depot, under a naval officer, is as below given: 1. Navigation, astronomy, meteorology, magnetism, and allied nautical physics and sciences ; nautical, astronomic, and physics instruments for the navy ; instrument depots, observatory (at Wilhelmshaven); chronometer institute, tide and wind gauges; revision of observations; chronometer aud meteorological journals; management of the funds for providing aud preserving the nautical instruments in the yards. 2.

Experimental research concerning meteorology, magnetism, the physical character of the sea, and of other branches of natural sciences. 4. Astronomy, geodesy, chronometer, ebb aud flow phenomena, magnetic and meteorologic observations. 5. Study of chronometers. The above Bureau was established in 1866, after the North German Confederation. There is no special class of officers for navigation and survey work; they are taken from the general duty officers of the line. Many hydro graphic surveys have been made in the Pacific by ships stationed in China and Japan. Kerguelen Island was surveyed in 1874 by the Transit of Venus Expedition The harbors of Morocco have also been surveyed. The meridian of Greenwich is employed on marine charts."], [514, "504 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Soundings are expressed in fathoms (Faden) = 6. 17832 English feet, or 1.02972 English fathoms. One of the most important works of the Admiralty is to provide charts of the east coast of Russia, those in existence being in Russian, and hence of no use to German sailors. Sailing directions have also been published to supplement charts, and also a handbook of navigation (1879), showing the employment of nautical instruments, &c. The German Naval Observatory at Hamburg, published, in 1882, a hydrographic atlas ofthe Atlantic Ocean, \"Atlantischer Ozean,\" consisting of 36 sheets, representing the physical conditions and routes of navigation. Each sheet is accompanied by explanatory text. The maps are compiled from the latest data, and therefore form an important work for maritime meteorology. AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. Hydrographic. The meridian of Greenwich is employed on marine charts. The sea mile is the same as the English nautical mile. Soundings are expressed in fathoms (Klafter) 6.226 English feet. The following translated letter serves to give briefly the organization and scope of the Austrian Hydrographic Office (Hydrographisches Amt) at Pola: [Translation from the German.] Royal Imperial Hydrographic Office, Pola, January 17, 18S3. Honored Sir : I do myself the honor of answering your highly valued letter of the 13th of the past month, and of giving briefly the following information concerning the scope and organization of the Hydrographic Office. The Hydrographic Office is the depository for all instruments and everything else relating to the hydrographic affairs ofthe Royal Imperial Navy, especially for all the instruments, navigation charts, and nautical manuals required for the equipment of the fleets, as well as for naval literature in general. To it the task is assigned of serving as a medium by which the progress made iu hydrography and in its kindred sciences is brought to the knowledge of the Navy. It is likewise the duty of this office to supply new iustrumeuts aud charts, &c, aud to have the care of the hydrographic instruments already in use, as to the keep ing iu order, correcting, and testing of the same. Besides this, the Hydrographic Office has to set on foot such hydrographic surveys as are of direct practicable use for"], [515, "AUSTRIA-HUNGARY- HYDROGRAPHIC. 505 the Royal Imperial Navy, and later to draw up the uecessary instructious for them, likewise to execute scientific works, which stand either in near or distant relation to the objects for which the office exists, and, finally, to deliver technical opinions on all questions relating to hydrographic affairs. It has finally again (as often as convenient) to make the proper suggestions relat ing to the modification or supplementing of the orders with regard to the sphere of its own functions, and to take care that these orders are strictly carried out on all sides. The Hydrographic Office is divided into the following four sections (a) The observatory for astronomic, meteorologic, magnetic, and tidal obser- vations. (b) The instrument depot with the mechanical workshop. (c) The depository of marine charts and nautical manuals. (d) The naval library for a general depository of professional literature. The personnel of the Hy'drographic Office consists of \u2014 1 director. 4 chiefs of sections. 1 librarian. 1 superintendent of works. 5 mechanics, and 1 porter or messenger. Naval officers are temporarily detaded as chiefs of each section, for the perform ance of the duty as well as for the instruction. The regular publications of the Hydrographic Office are the following: 1. The Observatory publishes monthly the meteorological and magnetic obser vations. 2. By the Depot of Navigation, Charts, and Nautical Manuals there are issued the publications for navigators and hydrographic reports, general coast charts, and charts of the east coast of the Adriatic Sea. The charts are published by the firm of F. H. Schimpff, in Trieste, and Gustav Dose, in Fiume. Other publications have been heretofore occasionally made ; a translation of Evans' Deviations, new nautical tables, compilations of meteorological observations, a description of the great meridian instrument of the observatory, instructions, &c, on Peichl's and Garcis' compass, aud on Peichl's self-regulating compass, and similar matters. 3. The naval library edits the Austrian Naval Journal, \"communications with regard to naval matters,\" which contains the above-named meteorological and magnetic observations, information for navigators, and hydrographic reports. This journal is to be found at the commission publishing firm of Karl Gerold & Son, in Vienna. With the highest respect, I have the honor to subscribe myself your most obedient, R. MULLER, Director."], [516, "506 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. FRANCE. Hydrographic. The central and only office for hydrographic surveys is at Paris (13 University street), and is known as the General Direction of Hydrographic Services (Direction General des services Hydrographiques de la Marine), being in charge of an Admiral, who has the title of Directeur- General des Services Hydrographiques de la Marine. In the French Navy there is no separate service for the survey of the coast. The entire work relating to hydrography, both in France and its colo nies, and the correction and printing of charts is done at the above office, or under its supervision, by a corps of hydrographic engineers, associated with naval officers, under the Ministry of Marine. The officers are distributed on the coasts of France and its colonies for tbe field surveys, and their work is perfected at the depot during the winter months. The Director- General has under his orders the chief hydrographic engineer, the hydrographic engi neers attached to the depot, a curator of the library and scientific archives, an agent of administration, a storekeeper, the naval officers of commanding rank who are members of the hydrographic committee, the naval officers on duty at the depot, and all the agents employed at the establishment. The Director- General gives all necessary orders relating to the care, security, and police of the establishment; he distributes the duties of the hydrographic engineers and of the naval officers attached to the depot; he regulates the hours of work; he details the engineers for outside work; makes the estimates; superintends all purchases; orders repairs; prepares for the approval of the minister all agreements for furnishing stores, &c. ; submits to the minister, with his indorsement, the recommendations of the hydrographic committee ; and submits to the approval of the minister plans of important changes in materials for the depot. He makes an annual report of operations. The hydrographic engineer-in-chief submits to the Director-General all measures which he considers necessary for the hydrographic service; he superintends the manufacture, repair, and preservation of instruments; he has charge of the arrangement and preservation of all material in depot; he keeps a record of all information relating to the chronometers and nautical"], [517, "507 FRANCE\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. instruments belonging to the Navy. In the absence of the Director-General he takes his place. The duties of the hydrographic engineers at the depot depend upon their detail; they make all preliminary charts; correct the charts in depot; superintend the printing; make out lists of charts to be furnished vessels. Away from the depot their duty also depends upon the detail, embracing all hydrographic work within the limits of their station, verifying the positions of buoys, and beacons, observations of tides, currents, &c. The hydrographic committee is composed of the Director-General, president, the hydrographic engineer-in-chief, two hydrographic engineers, two naval officers of the rank of captain or commander, and an assistant hydrographic engineer, who is secretary, without any deliberative voice. The members of the committee are detailed by the minister on the recommendation of the Director-General, and are changed every two years. The committee gives its advice \u2014 On expeditions and hydrographic work to be undertaken; on the use- fulness and degree of urgency required in editing and publishing hydro- graphic notices; on the value of work that has been performed, on the cor- rections to be made in charts and nautical works already published, and on the suppression of these documents where incorrect information might lead to dangers in navigation; on the utility of purchasing books, charts, marine watches, instruments of precision, and other articles relating to navigation; on all questions referred to them by the Director-General, particularly those which relate to the publication by the Navy of accounts of voyages, and other works on nautical and hydrographical subjects, of which the whole text may be submitted to them; on the execution of the plates delivered by the engravers. The committee also prepares plans for hydrographic reconnaissances, and draws up the instructions to be given to expeditionary vessels. The administrator has charge of the purchase of all material and the sale of charts. The material belonging to the depot comprises the following objects: 1. Chart-sailing iustructions, instruments, chronometers, aud marine watches, and all other objects used in navigation, which are ready for issue to vessels or to naval observatories."], [518, "508 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 2 The copper plates, presses, paper, and tools used iu printing. 3. The books, charts, plans, aud drawings belonging to the archives and library. 4. The chronometers and navigating instruments which have been issued for ser \\ ice. The assistants of the Director-General were (1882) one engineer-in chief (with the rank of vice-admiral), 17 hydrographic engineers, inde pendent of officers of the Navy detailed upon hydrographic work. The hydrographic engineers are all graduates from the Polytechnic School. At one time these engineers performed all the professional work, but latterly Na*\\y officers do a share, as well as translate from foreign languages. Where naval vessels are used the commanders and captains (while clothed with absolute control as a war necessity) do not actualy direct the details of 1 he hydrographic work, still the latter, however, could not be performed, if 1 he usual naval movements of the vessel were such as to prohibit. The actual hydrographic survey of the French coast has for a long time been completed, but constant revisions are going on, especially in the vicinity of important harbors. The survey of the Algerian and the reconnaissance of foreign coasts are still in progress. The publications (instructions, reports, and maps) are numerous, all of which are exchanged with the Hydrographic Office at Washington. The light-houses are laid down on a special edition of coast charts. Among other publications is that of Commander Benare, being a formida ble table of distances from port to port, for the whole world, each distance being reckoned on a great circle. The jurisdiction of the Hydrographic Bureau extends over home and foreign coasts, and its duties, as in case of all foreign hydrographic offices, relate to both field and office work of survey and to the preparation and publication of maps, charts, reports, treatises, notices, lists, &c. The operations of the hydrographic surveyors extend to the limits of tide-water, or, where there is no tide, to the head of navigation. The meridian of Paris is in use for marine charts. Soundings are expressed as follows : French fathom on old charts (Brasse) = 5.329 English feet = 0.888 English fathom ; French meter (metre) = 3.281 English feet = 0.547 English fathom. The French metre,"], [519, "509 HOLLAND\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. the Dutch \" elie,\" and the Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian \" metro \" are of equal lengths. The soundings are sometimes given in feet on plans of harbors. The marine league = 2J5 of a degree of meridian (mean) = 5,555.5 meters or 3.452 English statute miles. The nautical mile is the same as the English. The conventional signs are substantially the same as those for the Staff map (1 : 80,000). The soundings are explained on each chart. France has lately been engaged in perfecting detailed surveys of her home coasts and of the northern coasts of Africa, revising the charts of the Grecian Archipelago, at the same time making surveys of the coasts and rivers of Cochin China and of the shores of the Gulf of Tonquin, and com pleting surveys of French possessions in the South Pacific. HOLLAND. Hydrograph ic. The hydrographic coast work of Holland, projected purely in the interest of navigation, is carried out entirely by naval officers, under the Hydrographic Bureau of the Ministry of Marine. Its jurisdiction is confined to the home coasts, there being a separate office for the survey of the East India coasts (under a lieutenant of the navy assisted by a number of officers) at Batavia, Island of Java. Its labors are confined to soundings and observations at the mouths of rivers and harbors and along the coast to the head of tidewater navigation, the main survey of which has long since been completed. The field-work is done entirely by naval officers. All the charts of the coast and harbors are engraved and printed at the Admiralty. There were (1882) two small vessels on coast survey duty. The shifting character of the Dutch coast requires constant care and watchful ness, and affords ample revisionary work. The officers employed on survey duty are young lieutenants taken from the general list, there being no special navigating or surveying class in the Dutch navy. The present organization consists of 1 chief of bureau, 3 naval officers, 4 engravers and clerks. As is the rule in European countries, the initial"], [520, "510 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. points of departure for marine surveys are the points trigonometrically determined by the topographic land survey organizations, nothing more than a minor triangulation ever being necessary for any determinations directly on the coast, or the location of special hindrances to navigation, as reefs, sunken rocks, &c. The present annual cost is 25,500 florins (approximately $12,750), which includes the pav of naval officers. Where practicable the scale of 1:50,000 is employed, while that of 1:25,000 has been often used, the largest scale found requisite having been 1:7,500. The maps are produced either b)' hand engraving on copper or by the etching process. The meridian of Greewich is used on marine charts. The nautical mile is ~ of a degree of meridian (mean), or about 6,076 English yards, or 3.4521 English statute miles, or 3 English mean nautical miles. On the older charts soundings are expressed in \"vadem,\" equal to 5.575 English feet or 1.029 English fathoms ; on more recent charts they are expressed in meters, being reduced to mean low water. There is also a separate hydrographic office at Batavia, under a lieu tenant in the navy, and Dutch surveying vessels are actively engaged in marine surveys of their possessions in the East Indian Archipelago. SPAIN. Hydrographic. Spain uses the meridian of San Fernando Cadiz for its marine charts. Soundings are expressed as follows : Spanish fathom (Braca)=r5.564 English feet\u2014 0.927 English fathom. Legua maritima\u2014 3 Spanish sea miles, or 3.458 English miles. The Spanish nautical mile rr 1529 English stat. milezzl English Geo- graphical mile.

This review begins by giving an account of the condition and progress of hydrography in the eighteenth century, without mentioning that of the"], [521, "SPAIN\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. 511 sixteenth, in which the Board of Trade of Seville furnished the hydrographic charts of that epoch, and in which such distinguished authors as Pedro De Medina and Martin Cortes published the \"Art of Navigation\" and the \"Com pendium of the Globe,\" works that were translated by the other maritime nations of Europe. Pre-eminent in the first half of the last century stands Don Jorge Juan, who, in connection with Don Antonio Ulloa, was sent to South America for the measurement of a meridional arc, conjointly with the learned French men, La Condamine and Bouguer. The hydrographic work for that cen tury began with the expedition to the northwestern part of America made by the corvette Santiago, in 1774, under the command of Lieut. Don Juan Perez, which went as far as the fifty-fifth parallel. \u2022 Then followed the works of Barcairtegui, who made a map of the island of Cuba; and the formation of the maritime map of Spain, in the five years from 1783 to 1788, by Don Vicente Tofino, at that time Director of the Academy of Midshipmen. Cap tain Don Jose\" de Cordoba explored, in the frigate \"Santa Maria de la Cabeza,\" the Straits of Magellan; the results of this voyage and of another later one, in two small vessels, the \"Santa Casilda\" and \"Santa Eulalia\" (1788-89), was the publication of 5 maps, of plans, maritime charts, and other information with regard to that part of South America. In 1789 the famous voyage of the corvettes \" Descubierta'' and \"Atrevida\" was under taken under the command of Don Alejandro Malaspino and Don Jose\" Bustamente, whose labors in the western portions of America, in the Pacific and in the Philippine Islands, resulted in the production of several charts. Afterwards that of the schooners \"Sutil\" and \"Mejicana\" took place, under the command of Captains Valdez and Alcala Galiano. The latter, in the frigate \"Soledad,\" explored the coast of the Mediterranean in a cruise of three years' duration, the fruit of which were several charts of that sea, and other matters of interest concerning the Archipelago, the sea of Mar mora, and the Black Sea. Many other explorations and works were made in different parts of America, the Philippines, and the Mediterranean, such as those of Ceballos, in Yucatan, Campeche, and all the Gulf of Mexico ; those of Rio, in Cuba; those of Colmenares, Moraleda, and Isasbiribil, on the western coasts of"], [522, "512 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. America; and those of Mouselle, in the Pacific; those of Halcon and Aubareda, in the Philippines; and those of other distinguished officers, for instance, the Hidalgo Churruca y Fajardo. To the initiative of the illustrious Don Jorge Juan is due the creation of the Hydrographic Office, founded in 1797, the first director of it being Captain Don Jose\" Espinosa y Tello. The establishment accumulated such a number of charts, plans, and manuals of navigation that it was necessary to remove it to a suitable build ing, the same which it now occupies, in the year 1800. In the year 1808 the office had 300 engraved plates, and in its library some 7,000 volumes of selected works, national and foreign, besides a great number of valuable manuscripts. The Hydrographic Qffice increased little by little and slowly developed in importance until the middle of the present century, when, under the com mand of the \"Brigadier in the Navy,\" Don Joaquin Gutierrez de Rubal caba, it acquired greater development, increased its personnel, and the school of engraving was founded, which has provided the establishment with excel lent artists. About the same time a Hydrographic Commission was organized for the Philippine Islands, which began its labors in 1850 under the direction of Lieutenant Don Claudio Montero, of the Navy, and successively under those of Don Manuel Villavicencio, Don Fabian Montojo, and Don Juan Viniegra. Another one was organized for the Island of Cuba, under the command of Don Rafael de Arragon, Don Augustin Serrano Mayoral, and Don Cecilio Pujazon ; and the most important one that was begun the same year, the accurate survey of the coasts of the j}eninsula, whose labors have been con tinued without interruption to the present time. Its successive directors have been Don Manuel Fernandez Coria, Don Jose\" Montejo, and Don Rafael Pardo de Figueroa. During 1859 and 1860, with a view of making a new description of the southern coast of Spain, various plans of ports and a collection of views were made by the Naval Lieut. Don Pedro Rindavetz. Other very useful works, although of less importance than those of the Hydrographic Commissions, had been made in former times on the coasts of"], [523, "ITALY\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. 513 Spain and in the colonial possessions, for instance by the officers Moreno and Herrero in Cuba. A catalogue of the works published by the office is herewith inclosed, in which are marked the charts and plans belonging to the various Hydro graphic Commissions. There is also sent a copy of the old regulations of the Hydrographic Office, to which have been added some new ordinances, made necessary by the increased development of the establishment. With regard to the pres ent organization the Hydrographic Office has the following sections : That for construction of charts, for which there are assigned six persons, who are designated as draughtsmen \u2014 constructors of charts. The compiling section, composed of several officers of the Navy. The workshop for engraving, composed of five engravers. The printing office, in which are printed the maps, plans, and views, which are engraved on copper, steel, or stone. Spain has \u2022been resurveying her Mediterranean coast, and the charts already published show considerable errors in those heretofore in use. A survey of the entire Phillippine group is being made, and Cuban charts are being thoroughly revised. ITALY. Hydrographic. [Translation from the Italian. ] DATA RELATING TO THE HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE OF THE ROYAL ITALIAN NAVY. The Hydrographic Office of the Royal Navy was founded by a royal decree in the year 1874. It is established in Genoa, and is in charge of a captain in the Navy, under the immediate direction of the Minister of Marine, in regard to everything relating to the hydrographic service and the other functions of the office. The personnel of the establishment is composed of\u2014 A captain of corvette, who is sub-director. Four Navy lieutenants, in charge of the different branches of the service. 1366 wh 33"], [524, "514 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. A commissary of the Royal Navy, who is disbursing officer. Five chief helmsmen, detailed to assist the officers. Two under helmsmen aud twelve seamen. In addition to the military personnel the office employs the following civilian assistants : A chief draughtsman. Six draughtsmen. One chief engraver. Six engravers. Oue chronometrician. A chief of the mechanical workshop. Six mechanical workmen. A chalcographer. A register. Two carpenters. Two men capable for the service, selected from the Invalidi. A porter. In the establishment tliere are two workshops. The first executes all* the work of engraving relating to hydrography; the second is a workshop for the construction and repair of nautical, geodetic, and topographical instruments. The duties of the officers are distributed in the following manner : The first officer has in charge the mechanical workshop for construction and repairs, has the care and custody of all the nautical aud geodetic instruments, is charged with the astronomical observations and the calculations relative to them, and regulates the chronometers. The second officer's duty is to keep informed of the systems of hydrography in use with respect to foreign publications, to be custodian of the library, and is charged with the corrections on the maps and pilot charts taken from the reports of navigators. The third officer must make compilations for the information of navigators and relative to the expeditions, the compilation and issuing of notes of corrections for maps and pilot charts ; he has in charge the magnetic observations of the office, aud the care of regulating and correcting the compasses on the ships of the Royal Navy. The fourth officer is in charge of the printing office and the office of draughts men, of the workshop of the engravers, aud the directiou of all the calculations rela tive to hydrographic work. This office provides all the ships of tlie Royal Navy with the hydro graphic data and charts, and the nautical and geodetic instruments with which they should be furnished, according to their special missions. In cases of ordinary equipment every ship belongiug to the Government is fur-"], [525, "515 ITALY\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. nished with chronometers, upright and ship's clocks, sextants, circles of reflec tion, barometers, thermometers, ordinary sulcometers, pendent log, ordinary sounding lines, sounding apparatus with steel chain, ordinary and variation compass, compasses for the long boats, artificial horizons, compasses, paral lels, station pointer, and graphic reporter. In case a naval vessel is destined for voyages of circumnavigation, or for stations in the seas of the far east or beyond the Mediterranean, the number of the chronometers is generally increased to four, and the ship is furnished besides with certain geodetic and topographic instruments, such as theodolites and tacheometers, as well as an apparatus with a steel chain for deep-sea soundings. The duty of making surveys of the coasts of the Kingdom is the exclusive function of this establishment. These surveys are executed by means of an annual hydrographic expedition of about 150 days, in a suita ble vessel and with special equipment, intrusted to the command of the captain in the navy in charge of the office. The work to be executed in each expedition is first regularly planned out ancl then submitted to the Minister of the Marine, to be approved by him. During the hydrographic expeditions the work of survey of the coasts proceeds at the same time with the soundings. The points of the general triangulation being known to which the work of the expedition must be joined, it is considered whether the said points are sufficient in number; in the contrary case, others-are determined, uniting these with the former and constructing upon them the necessary signs. Two officers are always assigned to duty on land for the topographic part of the work, charged with making the survey of the coast line by the beats of the tacheometer. The other officers have the direction of the soundings aboard and in the steam cutters. The boats are furnished with a provisional sketch of the small locality where they are to sound; they are provided with a sounding apparatus, with steel chains, and with graduated rods for the shallow places. Each boat must determine its position after every ten soundings, every change whatsoever of direction, and every time it encounters a rise at the"], [526, "516 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS, bottom of the water or any other obstacle whatsoever. The different posi tions are placed on the sketch by means of the station pointer. Meteorological observations are accurately made every two hours, and on every occasion it is sought to obtain from the natives all the particular indications of the place that may appear to be of any interest. The instru ments used are the theodolite, the tacheometer, the station pointer, and the circle of reflection. The working day is from daylight to sunset, with an interruption of two hours at noon that the men may rest and take their meals. All the work daily accomplished is at once indicated on the appropri ate drawing and accurately verified. If any irregularities are found in it or any spaces left out, the next day an employe' is sent back to verify it and fill up the vacant spaces. All the work of the survey and the sound ings are then placed on the drawing according to the calculations of the co-ordinates, of the points of general triangulation, of the secondary signal points, which serve to determine the positions of the soundings and for a basis of the topographic survey, besides all the tachimetric stations made by the topographers from the point of the pyramid. These numerical data being placed on the sheet, the work done aboard is compared with these exact points, and if between the points obtained graphically and those cal culated there is found to be an}7- difference, all the work of sounding as well as of topography is gone over again. The general work is then transferred from the drawing to the copper by a proceeding identical with,*that de scribed below, so that it remains for the engraver simply to engrave that part of the coast comprised between the different points set as co-ordinates very near each other. To transfer the soundings from the drawing to the cop per, it is usual to cut a network on the plate with the machine, correspond ing to that which was marked on the drawing, and to this the engraver must refer for marking down all the points of the soundings. The lines of profundit}\" are not marked on the plans according to the scale fixed by the publications, but are deduced from the original work where all the sound ings executed are placed, only a small part of which are marked on the maps. After the copper is engraved, before being sent to the printing office, it is plated with steel to increase its durability."], [527, "517 ITALY\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. In the deep-sea soundings ancl \"thalassographic\" explorations, when the exact position of the ship cannot be ascertained by means of points on land, it is obtained from observations taken every two hours, and for this duty -two officers are specially detailed. The work doue by the office in the six hydrographic expeditious already com pleted may be summarized in the following statement: The survey has been made of 2.722 kilometers of coast line, inclusive of the sur vey of 24 plans of ports ; 404,827 soundings have been made along the coasts of Italy and the Island of Sardinia. The latitude aud longitude of various principal points have been determined. Deep sea and \"thalassographic\" explorations have been made. There have been published under the direction of the office, 7 general maps, 32 coast maps, and 24 plans of harbors. The album of views and descriptions of the light-houses aud beacons on the coast of Italy. There is published annually an index of the light-houses and beacon lights on the coasts ofthe Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, aud the Sea of Azof. There have been published also under the supervision of the office the two vol umes of Captain G. B. Maguaghi's \"Nautical Tables and Formulas, and Tables of Azimuths.\" All the copper plates of the maps and harbor plans published up to the present time were executed in the engraver's workshop. In the mechanical workshop, besides all the repairing doue to the various instru ments for the use of the ships in the Royal Navy and the hydrographic work, there are being constructed normal aud liquid compasses according to the new system, circles of reflection, sounding apparatus for great depths, all these instruments being constructed according to designs given by Captain G. B. Magnaghi. The annual budget ofthe office is 230,000 Italian liras (approximately $45,000). This sum does not include the expense of tlie equipment of the hydrographic vessel, which is charged to the general appropriation for naval armament. The Royal Observatory of Naples is sometimes referred to in Italian marine charts. The nautical mile is the same as the English sea mile. Upon some charts the soundings are given in French feet. An Atlas of the Adriatic Sea was published by the Military Geographical Institute, at Milan, assisted by Neapolitan officers, in 2 sheets, 1 : 500,000, also with 30 detailed sheets, 1:175,000, and 100 views of the principal seaports, from 1817 to 1830. Italy is engaged in a resurvey of its coasts and adjacent waters."], [528, "518 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. SWEDEN. Hydrographic. The Hydrographic Office of Sweden is under the Navy Department. Its duties are as follows : Hydrographic surveys of the coasts, the lakes open to navigation, soundings, and general exploration of the waters sur rounding the country, and coast defenses, magnetic observations, &c*; also the publication of charts and descriptions of coasts, channels, &c. The office is wholly naval, (the work of surveying being done by naval officers,) and engraves and prints its own charts. The men for surveying work are taken from the general-duty officers of the line, there being no special class for navigating and surveying purposes. The personnel consists of 1 chief and a number of officers of the Navy and employes. The actual number is 4 officers and a draughtsman for the Survey proper. Sometimes an additional number of officers is detailed. There are also attached to the office 3 engravers and 2 plate-printers, who are engaged by contract. The annual appropriation amounts to 60,000 crowns (approximately $16,800). The pay of the chief and other officers is defrayed from naval appropriations, their allowances and emoluments, however, by the Hydro graphic Office. The annual revenue from sale of maps is, approximately, 15,000 crowns, or $4,200. The scales employed for the hydrographic maps of coasts, archipelagoes, and interior lakes, at 1:20,000, soundings nearest the coast, and, as far as the eye extends, at 1 : 50,000, and for the high seas at 1 : 100,000. The pro jection of the chart is the same as that employed for the General Staff's Topographic Map. All publications are subject to annual revision. The collection of charts published in 1878 comprises the Baltic, the Cattegat, and the Skager rack, as far as Lindesnaes, in Norway, and may be classified in 7 channel, 19 coast, and 15 special charts, or 42 in all.

Hydrographic works : The central institution for hydrographic works in Den mark and its colonies is \" Det Kongelige Sokaart Archive\" in Copenhagen, established 1784. The survey of the Danish waters was commeuced in the seventeenth century and occasionally continued through the eighteenth. In the nineteenth century, especially after 1825, the surveys have been continued without interruption by vessels of differ ent kinds aud size, according to the nature of the seas in question. The charts of Iceland and the Faro Island are every year improved by the men of-war there stationed. In Greenland and on its coast smaller or greater undertakings have likewise taken place at different periods. Such researches have, especially siuce 1870, been systematically continued. The \"Sokaart Archives has charge of all the chronometers aud other nautical instruments and books belonging to the Royal Navy, except the compasses, which are kept in the dock-yards. The \" Sokaart Archives' is conducted by a Director (officer of the Royal Navy), aud other naval officers are attached to it. The result \u2022 of the surveys are recorded and platted by an uncertain number of naval officers, varying according to require ment*. The personnel, besides, consists of an assistant, who keeps the accouuts, and the necessary number of draughtsmen, engravers, printers, &c.

In 1873, after advanced experience, the government of India decided to appoint a Superintendent of Marine Surveys, upon whom should devolve the responsibility of completing and maintaining the surveys of the Indian coast from the southern extremity of Tenasserim to the western limit of Sind, beyond which all surveys were to be undertaken by the British Admiralty. Commander Taylor was appointed the first Superintendent, and the annual expense of the office reaches about Sl00r000. In October, 1875, the duties of this branch of service were defined as follows: \"Sys tematic surveys of the coast of India are to be carried on with suitable vessels efficiently equipped and manned. These surveys are to be connected with the shore surveys, and closed in on points already fixed by the Great Trigonometric Survey. The original surveys of ports, harbor and river entrances, will be photozincographed and issued for local navigation and engineering purposes, and from them charts of the coast will be compiled on a medium scale for the purpose of general navigation. Copies of all original surveys will be forwarded to the Admiralty hydrographer for pub lication ; and all corrections of surveys and other information, such as notices of changes in the places of buoys, lights, &c, will also be trans mitted at once to the same office. \"A catalogue of all the charts of the department will be kept, besides a sufficient stock of Admiralty charts, and copies of these will be furnished to the local governments and public officers on demand.\" (See Markham's Memoir, p. 47.)"], [533, "523 JAPAN\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. These duties are discharged by the Superintendent, 2 deputy Superin- tendents, 9 assistant superintendents, 3 executive officers, 1 medical officer and naturalist, and 1 superintendent of drawing branch. The first report appeared in 1876. The \"Catalogue of Charts, &c,\" displayed at Venice, shows 59 maps as having been issued, as well as 155 volumes of sailing directions, notices, &c. The British Hydrographic Office at Calcutta is revising, correcting, and extending all the former surveys of the British East India possessions. It is understood that the publication of the final sheets or charts of this work is now done by and under the Admiralty at London. BRAZIL. Hydrographic. There is a Hydrographic Office under the Minister of Marine at Rio de Janeiro with Dr. Josd Rodrigues de Leria Quarte, as chief hydrographer, but no detailed information is at disposal. CHILI. Hydrographic. There is also a Hydrographic Office under the Navy Ministry at San- tiago, but detailed data are not available. In 1882, Chili was displaying great activity in her marine surveys along the coast of Chili, Peru, and Bolivia. JAPA1SY Hydrographic. Japan has established a well equipped Hydrographic Office under naval administration at Tokio, with Rear Admiral N. Yanagi, as hydrographer.

Coast and Geodetic Survey (Treasury Department). Origin. This work, commenced in 1807, again legislated for in 1832, did not reach its present basis until the reorganization of March 3, 1843. While first appropriated for in 1806 it was not actually inaugurated until 1807, when President Jefferson recommended the establishment of a national coast survey, \"for the purpose of making complete charts of our coast, with adjacent shoals and soundings.\" The plan of Mr. F. H. Hassler was adopted for the work and he was placed in charge. For various reasons only about two years of field work had been done before the Coast Survey as a civil establishment was discontinued and the office of Superintendent abolished by act of April 14, 1818. Between 1818 and 1832, desultory surveys only were made by Army and Navy officers, as results of which charts of some of our more important harbors were published. The Survey was re-established, pursuant to a recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy, by act of July 10, 1832, and placed by Executive order under the Treasury Department. By a subsequent Executive order the organization was transferred to the Navy Department, and after two years retransferred to the Treasury Department, where it has since remained. An act of March 3, 1843, provided that all appropriations, then and there after made, \"until otherwise provided by law,\" should be expended in accord ance with a plan of reorganizing the mode of executing the survey, to be submitted to the President of the United States by a board of officers to be organized by him ; the board to consist of the then Superintendent and his two principal assistants, two naval officers, and four Army officers. The President was directed to adopt and carry into effect the plan of said board. The plan reported by this board and the order of the President of the United States directing that it be carried into effect are contained in House Ex."], [535, "525 UNITED STATES\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. Doc. No 164, 28th Cong. 2d Sess., and Doc. 110, Treasury Department, and this has been the basis upon which the survey has since been con ducted. ORGANIZATION. * Mr. F. H. Hassler was Superintendent from 1807 to 1818, and from 1832 to 1843; Prof. A. D. Bache from 1843 to 1867; Prof. Benj. Peirce from 1867 to 1874; Carlile P. Patterson from 1874 to 1881; and Julius E. Hilgard till 1885. According to a statement of the Superintendent of March 11, 1884, there were 63 field and 114 office civilian assistants, while in August, 1884, tliere were 58 naval officers and 340 seamen of the Navy engaged. The total number of the field parties (1884-85) is given as fifty-eight. The total personnel (civilians, naval officers, and seamen) aggregated 575 in all. Army officers were employed on this work up to the War of the Rebellion, since which date none have been so employed. Commander Sigsbee states (Annual Report Secretary of Navy, 1882, p. 250) that 1,510 naval officers, including 1,279 from the line and 231 from the staff, have been attached at intervals since 1832; also, that of the commissioned line officers now on the active list of the Navy (the line being that body which performs the surveying duty) 24 per cent, of the whole have been attached to the Coast Survey. At present all the hydrography is done by naval officers. ADMINISTRATION. The administration of this work, as a separate organization, has been with the Treasury from 1807 to 1818, and from 1818 to date, with the exception of two years, under the Navy Department. FUNCTIONS. Its functions may be understood in the main by the following sections from the Revised Statutes : Sec. 4681. The President is authorized to cause a survey to be taken of the coasts of the United States, in which shall be designated the islands and shoals, with roads Note. \u2014 In 1881-82 there were 217 civilians employed, under 41 different beads, as assistants,sub assistants, aids, computers, draughtsmen, engravers, mechanicians, &c; 60 naval officers and 276 seamen (see H. Ex. Doc. No. 23, 47th Cong., 2d Sess., and H. Es. Doc.

(From Laws of February 10, 1807, and July 10, 1832.) Sec. 4082. The Presideut may also cause such examinations and observations to be made with respect to Saint George's Bank, aud to anj- other bank or shoal, aud the soundings ancl currents, although beyond the distance of 20 leagues from the shore to the Gulf Stream, as he may deem especially subservient to the commercial interests of the United States. (Act of February 10, 1807.) Sec. 4083. All appropriations made for the work of surveying the coast of the United States shall be expended in accordance with the plan of reorganizing the mode of executiug the survey, which has been submitted to the President by a Board of Officers organized uuder the act of March 3, 1843. Sec. 4684. The President shall carry into effect the plan of the Board as agreed upon by a majority of its members; and shall cause to be employed as many officers of the Army and Navy ofthe United States as will be compatible with the successful prosecution of the work; the officers of the Navy to be employed on the hydrographic parts and the officers of the Army on the topographical parts of the work. The following extract from \"Plan for the reorganization ofthe survey of the coast,\" &c. (approved 1843), in pursuance of the act of March 3, 1843, taken from House Executive Document No. 164, Twenty-eighth Congress, second session (March 3, 1845), bears upon the functions, personnel, and administration of this work, viz: a. A series of main triangles, having sides as long as practicable, shall be carried along the whole line of the coast, aud be connected, at proper intervals, with bases, measured by the most approved means which modern science affords. b. At the most favorable points of this main series observations shall be made for the determination of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, as the state of the annual appropriations may allow. * * # c. A series of secondary and, where necessary, of tertiary triangles, based upon the liues of the primary triangulatiou, shall be made, if practicable, at the same time as tbe primary. d.

All vacancies which may occur hereafter in the scientific department of the Coast Survey shall be supplied from the Army if haviug reference to the operations upon laud, and from the Navy if in reference to operations upon the water. The following from the same executive document, taken from the approval of the President (John Tyler) of the plan of reorganization proposed by the Board, indicates the practical status of the administration of this service, viz: The charge of the survey of the coast is continued in the Treasury Department, and is to be under its control. The subsequent extension of the temporary jurisdiction of this Work through appropriation acts may be briefly summarized as follows: Investigations into the characteristics of the Gulf stream, involving tem- peratures, deep-sea soundings, and sea-current observations, were authoized and appropriated for March 3, 1853. The effect ofthe above was to authorize the publication of \"sailing\" or off-shore charts. The survey of Lake Champlain was appropriated for July 15, 1870. In 1881-82 there were, independent of the Superintendent, 217 civil- ians employed (see House Executive Document No. 23, Forty-seventh Con- gress, second session), under 41 different heads, as assistants, subassistants, aids, computers, draughtsmen, engravers, mechanicians, &c. According to the Navy Register of 1883, there were 50 naval officers engaged on this work ; while in January, 1879, tliere were 60 naval officers and 276 sea- men (see House Executive Document No. 62, Forty-fifth Congress, third session). In an appropriation act approved March 3, 1871, authority was granted to make a geodetic connection between the belts of triangulation of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and the vicinity of the thirty-ninth parallel N. latitude was selected for that purpose, while the use of the word \" Geodetic1,1 as a part of the title of the Survey first appears in the appropriation act of 1878. The above act also granted, pursuant to the appropriation, the authority to \" determine points in each State ofthe Union ivhich shall make requisite pro- vision for its own topographic and geologic surveys,\" and also authorized a \"development of dangers of ocean navigation'''' between San Diego, Cal., and Panama."], [538, "528 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. Deep-sea operations throughout the Gulf of Mexico, and to an indefi nite extent in the Pacific Ocean, were appropriated for March 3, 1875. The survey of rivers to the head of ship navigation or tidal influences appears in the appropriation act of June 20, 1878. This act also extended the work to include deep-sea dredging for animal forms, and widened the field of operations to include a part of the Caribbean Sea. In the appropriation act of March 3, 1879, the title \"Coast and Geodetic Survey\" first appears, which is also first borne on the annual repoit for 1878. This act embraces a still wider field of operations for all classes of deep-sea works, including the whole Caribbean Sea, and also the whole Sargossa Sea, in mid-Atlantic Ocean. That up to the year 1858, at least, this work had been looked upon as temporary is evidenced by the following from a letter of December 28, 1857, by the Superintendent to the Secretary of the Treasury (see Senate Ex. Doc. No. 6, 35th Cong., 2d sess.), wherein Professor Bache says : 17. In determining the scale and mode of executing the coast survey, it should be considered that the work is a temporary one, having a limited object, the surveying of a definite extent of coast. The following appears in a report of the Secretary of the Treasury to the Senate (1851): Nor is this increase like that of an appropriation for a branch of service which must always have an existence, since it decreases the time during which the survey will last. As above stated, however, other objects have been added in the appro priation bills. The survey is divided in twelve sections for the coast proper, to which four others have been added for transcontinental work and the aid rendered State surveys. The meridian of Greenwich is used on the charts, which are constructed on the polyconic projection. Soundings are expressed in feet up to 18 feet, and in fathoms beyond that depth, giving depths at mean low water. The law upon which the work of the Coast Survey is founded clearly defines it as an aid in commerce and navigation, while a clause in the plan above given provides for the topography to be carried as far inland as"], [539, "529 UNITED STATES\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. needed for purposes either of \"commerce or defense.\" It does not appear, however, that the board of officers of 1843 had jurisdiction over the pur poses and objects of the work, but only as regards \"the mode of execut ing\" it. PROGRESS. The yearly progress is noted in each annual report of operations. Special reference to a summarized progress is as follows (see Sen. Ex. Doc. No. 6, 35th Cong, 2d Sess., December 28, 1858): 2. \" Taking all the operations into consideration, the Atlantic sections are more than half done, the Gidf sections are nearly one-third done, and both can at present rate of appropriation be completed in from 10 to 12 years by close economy and thorough efficiency of arrangements.'\" Since then the survey of the Pacific and Alaskan coasts has been taken up, and also the transconti nental triangulation. On December 15, 1884, the Superintendent testified to the condition of progress of the survey of the coasts before the Joint Congressional Com mission as follows (see pp. 135-137, and 140) : \"On the Atlantic and Gulf coast the survey is about nine-tenths completed.\" \" The changes which take place in the shores and channels, mainly from natural and partly from artificial causes, render resurveys necessary from time to time in different places in order to keep the charts and sailing directions up to date.\" \" The work of the Coast Survey proper on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, requires four years to make the surveys continuous at the present {last year's) rate of appropriations.\" \" The survey ofthe Pacific coast between San Diego (the Mexican boundary) and Fuca Straits, with Puget Sound, is about three-fifths done, and the publication of charts, sailing directions, and tide-tables is proportionately advanced. The same considerations in regard to future resurveys obtain here equally as on the Atlantic coast. I estimate the time required {for completion) to be about 9 years at present (last year's) rate of appropriation.\" As a rule, the topography extends from 1 to 3 miles from the shore line, but in special cases it may extend much farther inland or be much narrower. Judging from the testimony of the Superintendent before the 1366 wh 34"], [540, "530 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. above Commission (see p. 160), it would appear that so far only recon naissance charts have been issued of the Alaskan coast. The office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey under date of January 5 and 7, 1886, furnishes, among others, the following as results to July 1, 1885: . Square miles. Reconnaissance 377, 960 Triangulation 199, 864 The reconnaissance and triangulation areas refer both to coast and interior work (the latter authorized only since 1871 in connection with the transcontinental belt and as an aid to State surveys), no office separation having been made. The reconnaissance preliminary to the triangulation is not productive of either mathematical or final results. By measurements made by the Coast Survey Office from original sheets and otherwise, the following appears as the areas actually surveyed (January 5, 1886), ofthe classes stated: Topography. Locality. Extent. Sq. stat. miles. Atlantic coast 18, 105 Gulf coast 6,018 Western coast 3,364 Interior 4,342 Total 31,919 Hydrography. T ... Inside hy- ! Ontsiile by- scanty. clrography. ! drograpby.

The first comprises that inside the general coast line, and includes all bays, sounds, and rivers. The second comprises the more or less detailed work outside, including open bays, averaging about 15 miles in width."], [541, "531 UNITED STATES\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. Beginning in 1883, regular reconnaissance work in Alaska, it is stated, has progressed over an area of 3,500 square miles, comprising both topog raphy and hydrography, more preliminary in character. Numbers of primary and subordinate base lines have been measured, astronomic and azimuth stations determined, with many results from spirit and trigonometrical levelings, as well as the magnetic elements of numerous stations ; also, deep-sea soundings over large areas in the North Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, with extended tidal observa tions and many gravimetric determinations \u2014 all of which constitute a large amount of miscellaneous work by this office, which for want of space is not particularized. The approximate length of coast lines undergoing examination and survey by this organization is for the Atlantic coast, approximately, 5,380 miles; the Gulf, approximately, 4,280 miles; the Pacific, approximately, 3,120 miles; and the Alaskan, including the Aleutian Islands, approximately, 5,100 miles. The only official authorized by the organic act is a Superintendent, at the rate of $6,000 per annum. The balance of the civilian personnel are paid from annual appropriations. Up to the outbreak of the war of the rebellion both officers of the Army and Navy in considerable numbers were detailed upon this work, in consonance with the plan of reorganization of 1843. The principal part of the professional personnel is taken from civil life, while naval officers hold in some numbers positions more purely, however, as in charge of, and for the execution of, field hydrography. The survey of the Atlantic coast is substantially completed, except for the necessary revisions, while there is yet much to be accomplished on the Pacific coast, and that of Alaska is scarcely touched by the systematic survey. Work still remains to perfect the transcontinental triangulation. The date of final completion of this work it is impossible to state, for want of official data. The admirable results of this office are best shown by its separate annual reports, commencing in 1852 and continuing to date. These embrace, besides a detail of operations, treatises on various scientific subjects incident to the work of the Survey, by various assistants, qualified in special branches."], [542, "532 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The character of the coast charts is best understood by a reference to the printed list. COST. The amounts appropriated for this work from 1806 to June 30, 1886, aggregate $20,072,136.56. The current annual appropriation is $523,398.82, with $100,000 for purchase of vessels. There had been directly expended by the Coast Survey from its own appropriations to June 30, 1884, the sum of $19,349,112.03 (see Sen. Ex. Doc. No. 35, 31st Cong, 2d Sess., and testimony before Joint Congres sional Commission, p. 61). The above is independent of the expense borne by Army and Navy appropriations. The former ceased during the war of the rebellion. The Secretary of the Navy, in his Annual Report for 1882, gives the following as actual expenditures from Navy appropriations for the Coast Survey: 1879, $260,870.63; 1880, $229,969.32; 1881, $220,931.64. The expense borne by the War Department is not known. Commander Sigsbee, United States Navy, estimates (see p. 252, Annual Report Secretary ofthe Navy, 1882) $4,000,000 as the lowest total estimated amount of expenditure for all years (presumably to June 30, 1882), thus aggregating an expenditure (actual and estimated) to June 30, 1884, of $23,349,122.03, with the cost to the Navy of two additional years. Every expense for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1885, is given (see p. 553 of testimony) at $449,324. This swells the actual direct expenditure to June 30, 1885, to the sum of $19,798,436.03. Add $201,563.1.7 (an amount presumably underestimated), an assumed expenditure for the half year ending January I, 1886 (making round numbers), there results the sum of $20,000,000. To the $4,000,000 (estimated cost to Navy to June 30, 1882) the sum of $593,143 (being for 2J years to January 1, 1886, at an average of $237,257.20, see Annual Report Secretary of the Navy, p. 252), and there results, as a total direct Navy expenditure (estimated), $4,592,143. The aggregate of expenditures to January 1, 1886, thus reaches the figure of $24,593,143. The relative percentage of hydrographic to trigonometric work is estimated as three-tenths and two-tenths of the whole, and tha^ for topography at four-tenths, with the balance or one-tenth for work of a"], [543, "UNITED STATES\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. 533 general character (see- p. 148, testimony before Joint Congressional Com mission). Grouping the official data, all from the office of the Coast Survey, tliere results the following table: The cost to the United States, as above shown, for one square mile of topography on the resultant map would be $333, increased by the expense of the initial astronomic work, measured bases, and preliminary work, which are presumably a part of the one-tenth for general work. The cost of the inshore hydrography (being more detailed) is probably at least three times as much as that of the offshore; hence the sum of $93 per square mile represents only a part of the true cost of one square mile of complete detailed hydrography. The above is the most complete estimate yet made of the actual cost of finished work by this office. General Comstock made an estimate based on Coast Survey Reports from 1858 to 1872 of the average cost for 14 years, as follows: Per square mile. Triangulation $120 00 Topography 283 00 Hydrography 80 00 (See Sen. Ex. Doc. No. 21, part 2, 45th Cong., 3d Sess .January 30, 1879.) The amount for topography per se is not far different from that obtained by measuring the final total results and taking the corresponding total cost. The item for triangulation, however, varies greatly. At that date not so large a proportionate part of offshore hydrography had been done. The statement of a former Superintendent (see House Ex. Doc. No. 29, 45th Cong, 3d Sess.) places the highest cost of topography at $97 per square mile, and other examples much less. He also gives figures of $178, $120, and $56 per square mile as costs for hydrography. The cost as herein first above given, based on the official records of the Coast Survey, are the most complete and comprehensive exhibit yet made as to the principal inte gral parts of the whole work.

The publications of the Coast Survey consist of \"Annual Reports,\" <'Charts,\" \"Coast Pilots,\" \"Tide-Tables,\" and professional and scientific papers, the latter usually appearing as appendixes to the \"Annual Reports.\" The latter have appeared from 1 853 to date, in quarto form ; prior to which they formed a part of the regular executive document series. The charts are classed as \" Finished \" and \" Preliminary.\" The former are printed from engraved plates, and include all details; the latter are issued as soon as possible after the survey to meet the most pressing needs of navi gation, and are either engraved or photolithographed. The general character of the charts is as follows 1. Sailing charts, scale 1 : 1,200,000, exhibiting the approaches to a large extent of coast, and giving offshore soundings. 2. General charts of the coast, scales 1 : 400,000 and 1 : 200,000, espe cially intended for coastwise navigation, showing configuration of the shore, the positions of islands, rocks, and shoals, the light-houses, life-saving sta tions, and other natural and artificial land-marks. 3.

How inadequate these propositions are, as a presumed representation of the true requirements of this Government, a perusal of this report will disclose. HYDROGRAPHIC BUREAU, NAVY DEPARTMENT. Unlike similar offices. in all other countries the jurisdiction of this one as regards surveys is confined purely to office work, the reconnaissance of forefgn coasts, the establishment on foreign ground alone of geographic points (astronomically), while the Coast Survey has charge of the hydrog raphy of the home coasts. ORGANIZATION. The office is at present in charge of Commander J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., and has attached to it 23 lieutenants and 5 ensigns. Ten lieutenants and one ensign of this number are on duty at the branch offices in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Sew Orleans, and San Francisco. There are 40 office employe's, such as clerks, draughtsmen, engravers, printers, and laborers. No regulations have so far been established. The enabling act deter mines the objects and functions. The office has been continuously under the Bureau of Navigation since its creation. The following, taken from the annual reports of the Hydrographer and the Revised Statutes, will serve to convey an idea of its functions : Lieut. M. F. Maury when in charge of the Naval Observatory and Chart Depot, which was at that time under the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, began the collection of information from the logs of vessels according to a carefully devised scheme, for the purpose of making charts to show the prevailing winds aud currents, their limits and geueral characteristics, and, in general, all the physical features of the ocean, including its meteorology, the limits of icebergs, the feeding grounds of whales, and all facts of interest and value to the maritime community. From the data thus gathered Lieutenant Maury constructed his famous wind and current charts and wrote his sailing directions. These charts aud sailing directions have become known the world over, and the routes therein laid down for passages are followed to this day. It was estimated that the saving of time by the routes thus determined was equivalent"], [546, "536 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. to many millions of dollars annually. The continuance of this work, of invaluablo benefit to the maritime interests of the world, was interrupted by the war, Maury's last publication appearing as Monograph No. 3, iu May, 1861. The Hydrographic Office was definitely established by act of Congress approved June 21, 1866, now embodied in the Revised Statutes, as follows : Sec. 431. There shall be a Hydrographic Office attached to the Bureau of Navi gation of the Navy Department for the improvement of the means for navigating safely the vessels of the Navy and of the mercantile marine, by providing, under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy, accurate and cheap nautical charts, sailing directions, navigators, and manuals of instruction for the use of all vessels of the United States aud for the benefit and use of navigators generally. Sec. 432. The Secretary of the Navy is authorized to cause to be prepared, at the Hydrographic Office * * *, maps, charts, and nautical books relating to and required in navigation. * * * Books relating to navigation, sailing directions, and other information of use to the navigator have been prepared and published, correspondence has been carried on with foreign hydrographic offices, and the information thus obtained republished in the form of notices to mariners, which have been distributed gratuitously to marine agencies and insurance companies and to masters of vessels. The work of the office is arranged in six divisions: Chart construction, supply, issue, books, notices, and meteorology. CHART CONSTRUCTION. This now embraces the former divisions of drafting and engraving and plates and printing. Its duties embrace corrections and changes on manuscript charts and corre sponding plates, and printing from the engraved plates, &c. SUPPLY. The supply division has charge of all charts kept for issue to vessels except original charts of the British Admiralty. They include charts printed from copper plates in the chart construction division ; reproductions on stone of British a dmiralty charts, together with a few original French charts; and charts of the United States Coast Survey. ISSUE. The Hydrographic Office connected with the British Admiralty has published a series of charts numbering about 3,000, and representing bodies of water in all parts of the world. From 75 to 100 charts are issued and about double the number receive important corrections annually. The series forms the most complete collection in existence, and the navigators of all countries, whether naval or mercantile, must rely primarily upon this office for their charts. Of these publications the Admiralty chart division of the Hydrographic Office keeps at all times a supply. The production of sailing charts is iu some respects the most important function of the Hydrographic Office. Of the 789 charts issued by the office, those which embody"], [547, "537 UNITED STATES\u2014 HYDROGRAPHIC. the results of the exploring expeditions, 112 in number, are original. Thirty of the 140 office charts are also based upon original surveys made by United States vessels. The remaining 647, or 80 per cent, of the whole number, are reproductions of foreign charts, mainly those of the British Admiralty. DIVISION OF BOOKS. In the division of books there are 20,000 copies of the publications of this office, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and of the Light-House Board, and others purchased abroad for the use of our naval vessels. The first only are kept for sale. Several copies of each publication are always kept corrected to the latest date. NOTICE AND ARCHIVE DIVISION. The division of notices and archives contains single copies of 7,000 American and foreign charts, kept for reference. In this division is also filed all nautical informa tion, from whatever source received. The notices in foreign languages, including Chinese and Japanese, as well as those of nearly every country in Europe, have been translated by naval officers attached to the division. The information obtained from the notices has been repub lished iu notices to mariners, indicating changes of lights and buoys, and in hydro graphic notices, indicating changes in hydrography. METEOROLOGICAL DIVISION. The province of the meteorological division is to furnish blank meteorological journals to the masters of merchant vessels who are willing to post them, the masters receiving in return a set of charts covering the route to be traversed. The data obtained from these journals and from the log-books of ships-of-war are condensed for use in the construction of new editions of Maury's Wind and Current Charts. BRANCH OFFICES. Branch offices have been established in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, in rooms provided through the generous liberality of the Board of Trade in Boston, and of the maritime exchanges in the other two cities. The branches have been placed in charge of officers detailed from this office, with the approval of the Department. Each branch is supplied with charts covering tbe navigable waters of the globe, nautical works, light-lists, and sailing directions, all corrected to date. The plan has the double advantage of placing within easy reach of masters of vessels all the infor mation contained in the Hydrographic Office, and of enabling the office to obtain, with incomparably greater fullness, accuracy, and dispatch, all the information brought to those ports by incoming navigators as the fruit of their own experience. The cost of the Hydrographic Office since 1873, exclusive of the salaries of officers, has been $799,278. Prior to 1873 its funds were derived from the general appropriations of the Bureau of Navigation."], [548, "538 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The current annual appropriation is $74,040. The hydrographic charts already issued reach the number of 789 (inde pendent of 77 wind, current, and thermal charts), which compare favorably with those of the British Admiralty. There are 333 charts engraved on copper. On the late large-scale charts contours are used for hills, with roulette shading. The publications other than charts already issued are 66 in number. The charts are sold at favorable rates at Government agen cies, and the number called for is constantly increasing. Independent of the Hydrographic Office the Bureau of Navigation has issued several publications upon original determinations of geographic co-ordinates (astronomically)."], [549, "539 IV.-PUBLISHED WORKS OF REFERENCE.

All maps requiring large and successive editions with corrections and changes are produced by heliogravure on copper. Original drawing. \u2014 The most perfect original that can possibly be pro duced is considered one of the first essentials to a satisfactory heliographic reproduction. For physical and mechanical reasons the reproduction may be inferior in quality to the original, but never superior. The paper employed is specially made for the purpose, having a very smooth surface, thin but compact (linen and hemp combined), allowing of frequent erasures. It is claimed that, by mounting on cloth or a board, not only a part of the glue of the paper is lost, but that the texture of the cloth and the grain of the wood will appear on the exterior surface. Very smooth homogeneous surfaces are required in heliogravure, in the (1) original, (2) negative, {3) gelatine pigment transfer paper, and (4) in the silvered copper transfer plate. Any change from atmospheric causes of size of original is allowed for in the negative. The drawing must be black, continuous, and sharp. Broken and cross lines are to be avoided, while the hachures should meet with equal strength. The retouch is generally required only for connecting occa sional broken lines, and for strengthening up light parts. The hachures, where reduction is made, should be more open than the scale requires, as the reproduction from the reduction may else be darker than required. The hachures must never cross roads. Too much skill and eare cannot be devoted to the original. There is a limit in the reduction which is the largest that can be made without detriment to the appearance ; the relation of reduction from 1:60,000 to 1:75,000 has been found by experience to be the best. Next in importance to the perfection of the original is to have a brill iant negative. The exposure room has upper and side light against the"], [558, "GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. 548 camera, but is otherwise dark. The drawing, unmounted, is first clamped on a movable frame and then by the use of screws stretched as tight as a drumhead. It is then hung on a movable upright frame-work; this frame work, by the aid of tangent screws, slides in all directions from a given center. By this means the center and the normal line of the drawing passing through it are placed in the vertical plane of the optical axis of the camera In front of the drawing two silver mirrors are placed so as to reflect back the downward rays of the light, which perceptibly increases the illumination. The cameras are of the usual construction and made to move on per manently fixed rails, to which the camera is screwed when the proper focus is obtained. The camera admits of movements vertically and horizontally. To each photographic room two dark rooms are needed for the preparation and development of the negatives. The exact dimensions of the photographic picture are marked on the plain glass of the camera, where all corrections as to size are made. Great care is necessary in these measurements, also in obtaining the focus requi site for necessary sharpness. The time of exposure is considered of high importance, too long or too short giving a useless negative. Before the death of Colonel Schonhaber experiments had been com menced to introduce electricity to aid in the light development. The diffi culty experienced in producing perfect negatives seems to be in the impos sibility to measure exactly the time and strength of light. Colonel Schon haber was of the opinion that electricity might be called in to play an important part by conducting a faint stream of electricity over the plate being exposed, thereby shortening the time and improving the sharpness of the result The finished negative must be perfect or another must be made. The dark part of the negative must be so opaque that objects cannot be seen through it. The following explanation of the manner of preparing the negative and producing the heliographic plate therefrom are the result of personal obser vation at Vienna, and of notes taken from the pamphlet of Major Volkmer."], [559, "549 METHODS OF REPRODUCTION\u2014 HELIOGRAVURE. Negative. \u2014 The work of the heliogravure divison begins with a reversed glass negative, which is compared with the original drawing in order to detect imperfections, which are retouched when necessary. The reversed glass negatives are produced with the glass side toward the object, the reversion by means of a glass prism having been found unreliable. The glass plates must be perfectly homogeneous, and with faces unvarying as to their parallelism. In the preparation of the plate the iodine chlorine collodion, with the ordinary litre bath, 1 : 10, is used the same as for common negatives. Developing fluid: 1,000 parts water, 31.2 parts sulphate of iron, 15.6 parts sulphate of copper, 52.1 parts of glacial acetic acid, 31.2 parts abso lute alcohol. For developing, 10 parts of this fluid are mixed with 1 part silver solution, 1 : 20. For especially weak negatives the following solutions (a and b) answer : (a) Thirty-five parts nitrate of silver, 525 parts distilled water ; to this solution add 35 parts citric acid, dissolved in 525 parts of distilled water. (b) Eight and three-quarters parts pyrogallic acid, dissolved in 1,050 parts of dis tilled water, freshly prepared each day. For rendering hard and firm, a solution of cyanide of potassium (1 : 16) is used. After the plate has been carefully washed, the uranium solution* and then the ferri cyanide solutions is applied, then again washed, and this pro ceeding repeated until the desired strength is reached. Finally a temperate gelatine solution (1:30) is poured over it and allowed to dry in a horizontal position, after the excess of liquid has run off. It is to be remarked that it is necessary to wash very carefully to avoid a yellow tint, and if the temper ature is low one must treat the plate, before the intensifying process, with warm water, in order to secure brilliancy. * Seele's Uraninin Intensifier. A : 17.5 parts nitrate of uranium. 17.5 parts white sugar. 700 parts water (distilled). t B : 17. 5 parts ferri cyanide of iron. 17. 5 parts white sugar. 700 parts water (distilled).

The gelatinized negative is now provided with a coating of raw collodion, then placed half an hour in a water bath and laid horizontally upon a table, then a wet glue coated paper is put over the collodion picture, then blot ting-paper, and pressed slightly with a cylindrical roller. The blotting-paper is then removed and the collodion skin, together with the glue paper, taken from the plate. A wetted sheet of paper, coated with a solution of gum arabic (1 : 13), is placed with its back upon a glass plate, then the collodion skin with its gelatine paper placed upon it, the skin covered with blotting-paper and passed between rollers. After remov ing the blotting-paper, the gelatine paper is taken from the collodion skin, the latter with the gummed sheet is placed upon a glass plate, holding as much water as possible upon its surface, then the excess of water is allowed to run off, the blotting-paper upon the collodion skin being placed between rollers and then the gummed sheet removed. Finally the collodion skin is covered with water in order to remove gum particles and then dried. Preparation of gelatine paper. \u2014 The transfer sheet used is the same paper as that employed for the original drawings (i. e., a high calendered, thick, linen, hemp and flax combined paper), which is treated to a gelatine solution, as follows: For 5 sheets gelatine paper 58 by 63 centimeters each, there is used 6 ounces best white gelatine, 3 ounces best white sugar, 100 ounces of water (a little more or less), then treated to a heat of 20\u00b0 25\" R. for about half an hour, then cleansed by straining, then treated to 2 ounces of spirits of ammonia (a little more or less) for further cleansing, then to 12 drops of creosote (a little more or less), when the gelatine fluid is considered complete and ready for the pigment. The pigment is lamp black, of which 72 grains of the fat sort made directly from gas (500 grams to the ounce Troy weight), and 63 grams of the burnt lamp-black of Com merce, without fat; the finest French black preferred. It was found advan tageous to combine the two, one (the fat) having a greater conductivity for the light rays. These are exact amounts, as determined by experience,"], [561, "METHODS OF REPRODUCTION\u2014 HELIOGRAVURE. 551 and must be weighed carefully each time. The gelatine-pigment fluid, having been prepared for the 5 sheets, is divided into five equal parts, the sheets are held in a horizontal stand in catch-pans prepared for the purpose in the dark room, the edges folded upwards and held by iron rods, and applied in much the same manner as collodion upon the glass negative, being allowed to dry on a twine net stretched on wooden frame from 2 to 4 days in the horizontal position, when the sheets are ready for sensitizing. Preparatory to exposure the transfer paper is sensitized in a dark room in a bichromate of potassa bath, which is composed of pure cold water of tem perature (approximately) 3\u00b0 R and bichromate of potassa, 1 : 25; the latter may be used 5 or 6 times. The bath lasts (approximately) 4 to 5 minutes, air bubbles being quickly removed with a hair brush; if left too long there is a tendency to a little dissolving of the gelatine. The sheet is then trans lated to the surface of a mirror plate glass of high polish and about 3mm thickness, held horizontal and brought to a perfect surface by contact, by a chamois skin rubber, lubricated with floured asbestos. The sheet must then dry in the dark room at an ordinary temperature. It occupies about 3 hours for the drying process by an air-fan driven by a stationary engine of half horse-power. The paper after being. sensitized must at once be put in a dark place and kept till used. Exposure. \u2014 The transfer sheet superposed upon the collodion side of the reversed negative is then exposed in the ordinary manner, except that a number of parallelopipedons of the same sized cross-section as the nega tive box, the sides of which are covered with dark cloth, are superimposed so as to control a prism of light with rays sensibly vertical to the glass, instead of the usual diffuse light. Sunlight is not required. The length of exposure is governed by the intensity of the light (measured by a pho tometer) and is usually 5 or 6 hours. A reversed relief of the original is thus obtained on the gelatine foil. Development. \u2014 After the exposure, the transfer gelatine foil is dipped in clear water until flexible (about 1 minute), air bubbles being removed by a camel's-hair brush and then brought most carefully in contact with the silvered surface of a copper-plate, thoroughly cleaned, and highly polished"], [562, "552 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. by means of dampening sufficiently the back surface of the transfer paper, the air between the surfaces of the copper-plate and paper being expelled by pressure with a straight edge chamois-covered rubber, which produces the necessary contact and adhesion. The surplus water is removed by blotting-paper. The development room is kept at an equal temperature, approximately 70\u00b0 F., found by experience to be the best. After about 5 minutes the plate is immersed in a cold-water bath to remove all 1 races of the bichromate of potassa, where it is kept from 15 to 25 minutes and longer, according to strength of same. Upon coming out it is sprinkled with distilled water. The copper-plate (^silvered) with the transfer sheet superposed is then introduced into a bath-pan, brought to a tepid heat (36\u00b0-42\u00b0 C.) b3' gas burners under a tin case, and allowed to remain according to temperature and hygrometric conditions from 15 to 25 minutes, when all the gelatine pigment surface except the equivalent of the lines of the drawing (which have become insoluble) are partially dissolved, and the judgment of the operator determines that the paper may be removed by drawing gently from each of the four corners when the partially dissolved portions of the gela tine pigment are rinsed off, there being left in clear cut relief lines the counterpart of those of the original design. The silvered copper-plate is then dried, usually 10 to 12 hours, and rendered of high conductivity by adding a film-like covering of powdered graphite and submitted to the gal vanoplastic process for, say, 24 hours, when a thin matrix of copper is formed containing an incision of the lines left in relief on the silvered copper-plate, which matrix, after further precipitation from 20 to 24 days, gives needed thickness, becomes the mother evidence, and upon which many corrections and retouches can be made before the final electrotype plate is produced therefrom. Both plates (the patrice and matrice) are finally placed in water and any remaining gelatine removed. Heliogravure prints first taken from the plate are rough, and the sharp ness, mobility, and tone of the result should only be judged after several impressions. Before commencing to print, a relief- electrotype plate is always made, which is held as the permanent original."], [563, "553 METHODS OF REPRODUCTION\u2014 HELIOGRAVURE. A copper-plate impression is transferred to stone by cleaning and inking as for a paper impression and then left overnight to dry. The next day the ink is dry and fills a part of the engraving. The plate is then freely inked and transferred directly to the stone. It is claimed that this plan is followed nowhere else, and that clear and sharp prints result, and that about one-half as much ink is transferred to the stone, hence fewer blurs. To form the relief heliographic copper-plates takes in the apparatus 5 hours, and to dry the plates 6 hours, at a cost of 4 to 5 florins (about $2 to 82.50.) To produce the final printing plate (over the heliogravure relief) by means of galvanoplastic takes 21 days, with cost according to size. Plates can be made in 10 days, but are found to be brittle and stiff, while the cost is no greater for the longer time, which is generally preferred.

In certain sheets no retouch is necessary. Additions and corrections are also made on the copper-plate, especially certain features, that can be done cheaper than by the draughtsman, as water-lines, &c. Estimates of saving in expense of the cost of reproduction of a given original by the heliographic as against the hand copper engraving process, have been made in favor of the former in ratios varying from 10: 1 00 to 1 : 1 00. This will doubtless soon be popularly rated, something like photolithography, the surface of reproduction being copper instead of stone. The great advantage of metal originals over stone is too obvious to need mention. The follow-"], [564, "554 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. ing has been estimated as the cost of the photographic and other parts of the outfit needed for heliogravure : Florins 1.

Setting up instruments, experiments, &c 2,000 Total 10,000 (or approximately from 84,200 to $5,000.) Heliogravure for the reproduction of topographic maps is now being employed elsewhere than Vienna \u2014 at the Government offices at Florence and St. Petersburg \u2014 and is undergoing the experimental stage at Paris, Stockholm, Berlin, Brussels, and Munich, and is actually employed at the private establishment of Lemercier at Paris. It is believed that the pledge of secrecy as to the process as used in general at Vienna has been removed, the weight and quality of certain substances employed only being kept for the use of the Government, while special training of not less than five to six months of a skilled photographic manipulator is required before the process as actually used can be applied successfully. The late General Michler, Corps of Engineers, stated, in a letter of May 23, 1881, the following as a comparison between the cost of a heliographic plate of one of the present series of Austrian maps (size 14 by 18.75 inches, scale 1 : 75,000) as compared with the cost of engraving the same by hand on copper: Heliogravure \u2014 Time, 22 days; cost, 31 florins; approximately 816. Hand engraving \u2014 Time, '> years; cost, 3,646 florins; approximately 81,823. I am told by Mr. Weyss (office Geographical Survey), who ac companied General Michler to Vienna, that probably this estimate proceeded on the supposition that the drawing is perfect, requiring no retouch, and also that the atlas sheet consists entirely of mountain work (two conditions that never actually occur) and hence the relation thus given of 1 : 114 is the largest ratio that could possibly obtain in favor of heliogravure."], [565, "555 METHODS OF REPRODUCTION\u2014 PHOTOZINCOGRAPHY. f- Major Volkmer gives the following as the relation between the cost of a plate produced by heliogravure and the same engraved by hand on copper: Florins. Expense of original drawing preparatory to engraving a sheet 53 c. m. by 63 c. m 100 For topography, 3 months 300 Add cost for hand engraving skeleton and lettering, 3 months. 350 Topography, 26 months 2, 850 Approximately 2\u00a3 years, at a total of 3, 600 Heliogravure requires a more precise drawing, which, on an average (according to terrain), requires about 12 months, at a cost of approximately 1,400 florins. The heliographic plate can be produced in four weeks, at a cost of from 40 to 50 florins, and for retouching from 20 to 250 florins. The total expense of a heliographic plate of the above dimensions is from 1,270 to 1,700 florins, and 11\u00a3 to 16 months interval. That there is a great saving both in time and cost over hand engrav ing admits of no doubt, no more than should be doubted the fact that suf ficiently good originals can be produced to warrant the use of the process, while having in view a faithful as well as artistic reproduction of the topo graphic map. PHOTOZINCOGRAPHY. There was introduced at the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton, England, in 1859, for reproducing rapidly in large numbers sac-similes of plans, drawings, &c, a method combining the accuracy of photography with facility of printing from zinc plates, called photozincography. These sac-similes, being in carbon ink, do not fade like photographic silver prints, and the process in certainty and celerity is quite equal to that (now so well known) of photolithography on stone, with the advantage of obtaining the transfer on zinc plate, lighter, more portable, and much more durable than on stone. An ordinary negative, on a glass plate, is taken, and the silver deposit blackened with corrosive sublimate and ammonium hydrosulphate. A sun print is then taken on paper coated with gelatine and bichromate of potassa, which, upon being exposed to light, is insoluble in water of not too high a temperature."], [566, "556 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. The print entire is covered uniformly with greasy transfer ink, then washed with warm water to dissolve the gelatine not acted on by the light, thus carrying all the ink except that on the insoluble portions. This produces a print in greasy carbon ink that may be transferred to zinc as readily as the ordinary photolithographic transfer can to stone. The sensitizing mixture, made and preserved in the dark room, is obtained by dissolving gelatine in hot water and adding a solution of bichromate of potassa in the following proportions : Gelatine, 5 ounces ; bichromate of potassa, 1^ ounces ; hot water, 4 ounces. The best results are obtained when the sensitized paper has not been kept to exceed three days, which should be smoothed by passing through the lithographic press before using. The time required to obtain the sun print on the sensitized paper varies from 1 to 20 minutes, according to amount of light, age of paper, and con dition of negative, which may be generally known by the exposed portions of the yellow bichromate surface becoming a dark olive color. The transfer ink is made by melting in an iron sauce-pan 3 ounces of Burgundy pitch, h ounce of white wax, and *- ounce of palm oil ; then, by degrees, 1 ounce of finely powdered bitumen. The mixture is stirred and heated over a fire until it commences to burn, after which add gradually 8 ounces of best lithographic printing ink, rubbed up with 4 ounces of lithographic varnish, which, upon mixing uniformly, is ground, little by little, on a hot stone slab, with a stone mull er. As many impressions can be obtained as in case of the ordinary trans fer by means of a tracing in greasy ink. Photozincographs exceeding 3 feet in length by 2 feet in breadth have been prepared successfully by obtaining a number of chromo-carbon prints from overlapping negatives, which are joined before transferring to the zinc plate. Photozincography has also been applied to the representation of build ings, natural objects, scenery, &c, with more or less success. Photozincog raphy has also been brought to a high state of perfection, under Colonel Avet, at the Military Topographical Institute at Florence, where, it is believed, a gelatine medium of transfer is employed. It is claimed by this"], [567, "557 METHODS OF REPRODUCTION\u2014 CHROMOLITHOGRAPHY. office that the heliogravure process, under the name of \"photogravure,\" was introduced at Florence prior to its being taken up at Vienna. It is thought, however, that the details of making the transfer to the copper plate at Florence vary from those at Vienna, but I was unable on account of illness to examine the process at the former place. At Florence a unique method of transferring from the field minutes (scale 1:50,000) to the finished original drawing of 1: 75,000 was noticed. This consists in making a photolithographic transfer to scale of 1 : 75,000 on stone, from which, upon transparent tracing paper, a print is taken -in white lithographic ink, from which the fatty excess is absorbed by coal dust. An impression from this is made upon the surface of the drawing paper, intended for the finished original, outlined to the scale of 1: 75,000, there being subsequently required only the inking of the lines, making the greater share of work only mechanical. Photozincography is employed as well at Vienna, and reference is made to Major Volkmer's pamphlet for much valuable and interesting data con cerning the whole series of mechanical reproduction processes. CHROMOLITHOGRAPHY. (Process Eckstein.) This method permits of printing, with the aid of a single stone, all the shades of a perfect flat tint, the lines and details of a drawing included. With 3 stones, it provides for the printing of an infinite variety of tints of a single or combiued colors. Explanation of the process. \u2014 For the chromolithographic reproduction of a chart, the stone is covered with a film or layer of asphaltum dried in a dark room. There is printed from a stone matrix a gray tint upon the film, which ought to be bronzed in gold powder. This film being hardened in daylight is left in turpentine until the non-hardened lines are washed out. The image being made by carbon photography upon an untouched stone, or upon the tinted one after the same fashion, or better by a counter impression, the parts of the stone remaining white are covered with asphal tum dissolved in turpentine. The stone is then submitted to a light cutting"], [568, "558 GOVERNMENT LAND AND MARINE SURVEYS. by a feeble acid bath. This bath attacks the stone in the parallel furrows dissolved by the turpentine in all the parts remaining uncovered. The light parts of the drawing, or those corresponding to the feeblest shade, are covered with autographic ink. Thus the first shade is obtained, and one proceeds to the second cut ting, which produces the second shade. The acid cutting is repeated in order to obtain successively all the shades required, from the lightest to the deepest, by covering them with autographic ink as fast as they are obtained, and taking precaution to regulate the duration and force of each acidula tion. By these operations the depth of the cutting is graduated according to the needs of the work, and in such a manner as to obtain all the intensi ties conformably to the model. A stone thus graved gives the impression of a drawing, distinguished for clearness and perfect finish. This process is found to be eminently adapted also for the production of works of art. For the very careful reproduction of a work of art, the stone receives, having been polished, the carbon image from a negative ; it is then covered with a thin film of varnish, composed of \u2014 3 parts of asphaltum. 5 parts of white wax. 4 parts of steariue. 2 parts of a solution of soda. The film being dry there is traced, by the rough diamond of a tinting or ruling machine, parallel lines, very close together, and crossing each other, rectangularly or diagonally. By this operation the diamond only attacks the varnish without touching the stone. For the impression of all the colors, three stones are sufficient to express the blue, the red, and the yellow. There is placed upon each stone a carbon image from the same negative. They are then manipulated as above mentioned. By the super position of the diverse shades obtained from the blue, the yellow, and the red, there may be produced an infinite variety of colors. THE CARBON IMAGE. The stone is covered with a thin solution of bichromate, China ink, and gelatine; the film, after being dried in a dark room, is exposed under the"], [569, "559 MEANS OF REPRODUCTION\u2014 SUMMARY. light for one minute. The image is disengaged immediately through the aid of tepid water and a brush. This method of reproduction was displayed at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, and is explained and illustrated in a pamphlet (see quoted list), then prepared by Mr. Eckstein (Director of the Topographical Institute, The Hague), the inventor. The process has also been employed at Vienna, and while commended because of using a smaller number of stones and consequent impressions, to obtain a given number of shades of color, and for its artistic effect, it has nevertheless been found difficult to make corrections after etching, and also to produce larger maps and drawings, the, corrections also requiring more time. Hence it is there claimed that it is not well calculated for maps required to be kept currently revised, but it is considered highly valuable for all geological, ethnological, statistical, and political maps, where oolor forms so important a factor. MEANS OF REPRODUCTION. The following summary indicates the manner of reproduction of the several Government Topographic Surveys of Europe as evidenced by the Exhibition: Heliogravure. \u2014 This is almost exclusively employed for the General and Special Map of Austria-Hungary, to a considerable extent in Italy, while Russia and Prussia had only commenced its use. Photozincography is employed exclusively in England for county and cadastral maps, and on a considerable scale for reproductions in Italy. Photolithography. \u2014 Employed in nearly all countries for provisional maps and plans, and specially in Belgium and Italy for reproduction of plane-table sheets. Copper engraving is still employed for the Topographic Maps of Eng land, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden, and the mountainous portions of Switzer land. Zincography has been adopted in France for the later Topographic Map, scale 1 : 50,000."], [570, "560 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE. Lithography . \u2014 This method is used for Switzerland (scale t : 25,000), for Belgium and Holland (scales 1: 40,000 and 1: 50,000),. the new map of Spain (1: 50,000), for Russia (scale 1 : 12 i, 000), and the Prussian plane-table sheets (1:25,000). The Topographic Maps of Austria-Hungary, Italy, Germany, and Russia (with exception o.' the Austrian General Map, 1:300,000, and the Russian General Map, 1: 420,000), are executed in black. The same is true of maps of England, Sweden, and France (scales, 1 : 80,000 and 1 : 320,000), and those of Belgium (1 : 40,000 and 1 : 50,000). Chromolithographic Topo graphic Maps are produced in Belgium (1:20,000), Holland (1:25,000) and colonies (1 : 100,000), also of France, Spain, and Switzerland, varying from 3 to 5 impressions. Plane-table sheets (field minutes) are issued as photolithographs and photozincographs in Italy, Belgium, and in Germany as lithographs. Austria produces copies of plane-table sheets by photog raph)'alone. Russia, England, Holland, and Switzerland publish these only to a limited extent, and France and Spain not at all.

REMARKS. The following is taken from the official report of Lieutenant-Colonel Versteeg, Royal Dutch Engineers, as Government Commissioner from Holland: Admirable was the sight in the department of the United States of North America, which we had the honor to have for our neighbor at Veuice, not so much on account of the number of things exhibited (although the rooms were very well filled) as for the wealth which shone upon one from every side; wealth, as well in the scien tific as iu the material sense. In that most important part of America all branches of geography aud her sister sciences are cultivated together vigorously and with great practical knowledge. The results in real wealth, to which this has thus far given rise, are set forth, I might almost say, iu a luxurious manner, aud accompanied by the finest"], [571, "REMARKS. 561 collectiou of photographs that can possibly be imagined, and which fill the spectator with astonishment and admiration for the natural scenery which the New World con tains. If one takes into consideration merely what has been doue by the Engineer De partment of the Army for the past ten years, not only in purely military affairs but also in the improvement of rivers, the projection of canals, surveying of great lakes, the laying out of roads, and its geological works, in 16 volumes, aud in making the neces sary maps, one must conceive a very high opinion of it; but this is increased not a little by seeing how the geographical branch occupies itself at the same time with geodetic, hypsometric, topographic, geologic, paleontologic, zoologic, botanic, and arch\u00e6ologic work. Circumstances seem to have brought it to pass that subjects of this nature are considerably further advanced in the less developed regions of the \"Far West\" than in the rich Eastern States; this is attributed to the fact that the former districts stdl remain directly under the control of the General Government, while in the States long since established, there exists more self-government, and these matters there had, therefore, to be transferred to several different agencies wherever the need for them has been felt. The following appears in the official report of Don Francisco de P. Arrilaga, Commissioner from Spain to the Venice Congress (printed at Madrid, 1882): The great American Republic has such au extensive territory that now, at the end of a century of wouderful civilization, it is still engaged in the exploration of cer tain regions. * * * The explorations of the Republic of the North, however, do not have the character of those that are carried on in other unknown parts of the world. Whether it is because the aboriginal races are nearly extinct, or whether it is because the Indians of the New World, with the exception of certain tribes, have never shown in their customs the sanguinary ferocity of the Africans, Asiatics, and of the inhabit ants of Oceania, or, finally, whether it is because the methods of explorations em ployed by the Americans are more perfect and more scientific, it is a fact that the geographical works of the districts still to be civilized, within the territory of the Union, seem rather like surveys tranquilly executed in the midst of civilized peoples. These explorations were the first thing that attracted the attention of all those who visited the North American section of the Exhibition at Venice. As a sample of them there was exhibited the surveys made west of the 100th Meridian, by Captain of En gineers Wheeler, Commissioner and Delegate from his Government to the Interna tional Congress. The Engineer Corps occupies itself very much with works of this character by reason of the nature of its institution and from having prepared for the execution of some of the great national works, such as the Inter-Oceanic Railroad, on account of which the first map ofthe country west ofthe Mississippi River was constructed, and from having had the duty of exploring the rivers, harbors, lakes, and territories bor dering upon that of the redskins and the Republic of Mexico. 1366 wn 36"], [572, "562 INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS AT VENICE.

Curves possess the advantage of simplicity in delineation, thereby admitting of the intro duction of greater detail for a given scale, at the same time preserving proper clearness. This method admits of the construction of a rough profile along any given trace, but for any general topographic survey yet pros ecuted, it is but too evident that different parts of any single curve are of variable accuracy and that practically any profile taken at will is open to doubt and of no particular value from au engineering point of view, the field within which, until latterly, the use of lines, cut by horizontal planes, as a basis for profiles and construction work has been confined. Still, when it is known that the curves employed to express topography are but a feeble representation of the true contour, no one need be misled by their show of accuracy, and at the same time the manner of determining them with greater accuracy will improve from decade to decade. It seems to be the general tendency of all European surveys to adopt curves in field minutes and plans at least, if not for the resultant general topographic map.
