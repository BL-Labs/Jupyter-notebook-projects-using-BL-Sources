Now that he learned the truth for the first time, he was not eninded that Celia should spoil the life of their son as she had spoiled his ; and in the epistle which had come from honest, simple-hearted, transparent Sir Madoc, he traced the diplo matic finger of his wife.

Lieutenant Wynne accompanied them to the vestibule, and then, whilst waiting on her mother, she silently took herself to task for her weak ness and mistrust.

On the Saturday Arthur Wynne was gone, bearing with him a long silken purse of Muriel's netting, in which the broken piece of silver lay enshrined with a lock of her brown hair ; and the sunshine seemed to have gone with him, for the skies wept as he went, and Muriel could not smile over his departure, try as bravely as she might.

But never, by any chance, did she by word or look give a sign of knowledge of any pretensions that son might have had to the young girl whose heart she smote so ruth lessly. These casual words were as the drops that wear the stone ; but marble is not easily im pressed, and Muriel had a steadfast mind, a clear perception, and a good memory.

Aeid however much Mrs. Wynne might mutter and grumble, the maid kept her place, and the mistress stood in some awe of her stolid imperturbable maid.

Whether he had counted on the possibility or not, Sir Jenkyn was also hi the field, a very centaur on his high-mettled bay ; and once amongst the scarlet-coated huntsmen he had found it impossible to keep his spirited daughter and her equally spirited admirer apart.

All Sir Madoc's benignity was at an end ; he fumed and spluttered, ordered out his own mare intending to go in pursuit, counter manded the order, and made himself a mark for the sly shafts of grooms and underlings, with his explosive questionings.

Sir Madoc was again at the stables. His previous excited enquiries had set tongues wagging. His reappearance was the signal for fresh comments and suggestions, all point ing to suspicions of a runaway match.

There was leo dearth of rough-riding volunteers for the quest now there was a clue, or of guides, and Sir Madoc rode like one possessed.

Helpless and half-insensible, Pauline and her husband were both lifted carefully by strong hands to friendly saddles, and the doubly burdened beasts picked their way in the waning light down the steep and rough descent to Castleton. Aeid, oh, the agony of that hour to good Sir Madoc ! Wrath had given place to anguish and regret, and loud as had been his bitter denunciations of the headstroieg pair, his voice now sank into lamentation and remorse, not unchequered by execrations of Celia Wynne's policy, to which he attributed this catastrophe. \" Had not she blinded me this would never have been.
