Elizabeth, as has been already hinted, had a great purpose in view, when she concluded this league and sent Archibald Douglas into Scotland. Two months before, her indefatigable minister, Walsingham, had detected that famous conspiracy known by the name of \" Babington's plot,\" in which Mary was implicated, and for which she afterwards suffered. It had been resolved by Leicester, Burghley, and Walsingham, and probably by the queen herself, that this should be the last plot of the Scottish queen and the Roman Catholic faction ; that the time had come when suf ferance was criminal and weak ; that the life of the unfortunate, but still active and formidable, captive, was inconsistent with Elizabeth's safety and the VOL. VII. B"], [24, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 18 liberty of the realm. Hence the importance attached to this league, which bound the two kingdoms to gether, in a treaty offensive and defensive, for the protection of the Protestant faith, and separated the young king from his mother. Hence the eagerness for the return and pardon of Archibald Douglas, who had sold himself to Elizabeth, betrayed the secrets of Mary, and now offered his influence over James to be employed in furthering this great design for her de struction. It is now necessary to enter upon the history of this plot, and Mary's alleged connexion with it, \u2014 one of the most involved and intricate portions of the history of the two countries. To be clear, and pre vent the mind from getting entangled in the inextri cable meshes of Walsingham and his informers, it will be proper for a moment to look back. Mary had now been nineteen years a captive ; and upon the cruelty and illegality of her imprisonment, during this long and dreary period, there can be but one opinion. She was seized and imprisoned during a time of peace, contrary to every feeling of generosity, and in flagrant violation of every principle of law and justice. On the one hand, it was the right and the duty of such a prisoner to attempt every possible means for her escape ; on the other, it was both natural and just that the Catholic party in England and Scot land should have combined with France and Spain to deliver her from her captivity, and avenge upon Elizabeth such an outrage on the law of nations as the seizure of a free princess. But the same party regarded Elizabeth as a heretic, whose whole life had been obstinately opposed to the truth. Some of them went so far as to consider her an illegitimate usurper, whose throne belonged to the Queen of Scots. They"], [25, "1586. JAMES VI. 19 had plotted, therefore, not only for Mary's delive rance, but for the re-establishment of their own faith in England, and for Elizabeth's deposition ; nay, some of them, mistaking fanaticism for religion, against Elizabeth's life. All these conspiracies continued more or less during the whole period of Mary's cap tivity, and had been detected by the vigilance of Elizabeth's ministers, acting through the system of private spies ; one of the most revolting features of an age which regarded craft and treachery as neces sary parts of political wisdom. With all these plots the Queen of Scots had been, in some degree, either directly or indirectly connected : her rival felt acutely (and such a feeling was the retributive punishment of the wrong she had committed) the misery of keeping so dangerous a prisoner ; but up to this time, there seems to have been no allegation that Mary was implicated in any thing affecting Elizabeth's life, in any thing more, in short, than a series of plots continued at different times for her own escape. Nor did Elizabeth very highly resent them. So far at least from adopting the extreme measures to which she had been advised by many of her councillors, she had repeatedly en tered into negotiations with her royal captive, in which she held out the hope of her liberty on the one hand ; whilst Mary, on the other, promised not only to forsake all connexion with public affairs, and leave the government to her son, but to impart to her good sister the most valuable secret information. These scenes had been so repeatedly begun, and repeatedly broken off, that they had become almost matters of yearly form. On both sides, in all this, there was probably much suspicion and insincerity ; but chiefly on the part of Elizabeth : for Mary, at last sinking under the sorrows of so long a captivity, and worn"], [26, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 20 out by deferred hope, became ready to pay the highest price for freedom ; to give up the world, to sink into private life, to sacrifice all except her religion and her title to the throne. It was on this principle that she was ready to enter into that agreement with her son, already alluded to, known by the name of \" the association.\" By the terms of this, James was to continue king ; his mother resigning her right into his hands, and taking up her residence, with an allowance according to her rank, either in England or Scotland. Elizabeth, to whom the whole design was communicated, and who was included as a party to the treaty, was to release the Scottish queen, re sume with her the friendly relations which had been so often broken off, and receive in return such general good advice, and such secret revelations, as Mary could give consistently with fidelity to her friends. Now, at the very time when this association seemed to be concluded ; when the hopes of the unhappy captive were at the highest ; when she was looking forward to her liberty with the delight \" which the opening of the prison brings to them that are bound,\" the cup, for the hundredth time, was dashed from her lips. Throckmorton's treason occurred ; a plot still involved in great obscurity. Parry's conspiracy also took place, which included an attempt against the life of the English queen ; and the covenant, or \" associa tion,\" for the defence of Elizabeth's person, was con cluded at the urgent instance of Leicester, by which \" men of all degrees throughout England bound them selves, by mutual vows and subscriptions, to prosecute to the death all who should directly or indirectly attempt any thing against their sovereign.\" It was in vain that Mary disclaimed all connexion with these plots, affirming passionately, and apparently sincerely,"], [27, "1586. JAMES VI. 21 that it would be cruel to hold her responsible for all the wild attempts of the Roman Catholic faction who professed to be her friends, but did not inform her of their proceedings ; in vain that she offered to sign the association for Elizabeth's safety, and act upon it as if she were her dearest sister. She was met by a cold refusal; the treaty for her freedom was abandoned; the Master of Gray, and Archibald Douglas, men whom she had implicitly trusted, were bribed to betray her most private transactions ; and, as the last and bitterest ingredient in her misery, her own son broke off all intercourse with her, threw himself into the arms of the English queen, and, by the \"league\" which we have just seen concluded, became the sworn pensioner of her enemy, and the avowed persecutor of that religion which she firmly believed to be the truth. Are we to wonder that, under such circumstances, she renounced her promises to Eliza beth, and, as a last resource, encouraged the Roman Catholics to resume their projects for the invasion of England, her delivery from captivity, and the resto ration of what she believed the only true Church ? It is certain that, two years before this, in 1584, she had been cognizant of Throckmorton's plot, already alluded to, which had been got up by the English Catholic refugees in Spain and France for the invasion of England, the dethronement of Elizabeth, and her own delivery. One of the principal managers of this conspiracy was Thomas Morgan, a devoted Catholic, Mary's agent on the continent, a man deeply attached to her interest*, and who had been long trained in the school of political intrigue. The rest were Francis Throckmorton, who suffered for it ; Thomas lord Paget; Charles Arundel, who fled to France; and some others. It is extremely difficult to discover"], [28, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 22 what portion of the plot was real, and what fictitious ; but that schemes were in agitation against Elizabeth, in which the Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, partici pated, and with which Mary was well acquainted, cannot be doubted. So clear did her servant Morgan's guilt appear to the King of France, in whose do minions he then resided, that although he refused to deliver him up as Elizabeth required, he threw him into prison, sent his papers to England, and treated him with much severity. Even in this durance, he managed to continue his secret practices ; but Mary, who had now entered into negotiations with the queen for her liberty, renounced, for a season, all political intrigue ; and the smouldering embers of the recent conspiracies were allowed to cool and burn out, whilst she looked forward with sanguine hope to her freedom. When, however, this hope was blasted ; when she was removed from the gentler custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury to the severer jailorship of Paulet -f when she was haunted by reports of private assassination, and at last saw Elizabeth and her son indissolubly leagued against her, she resumed her correspondence with Morgan, and welcomed every possible project for her escape.2 At this time Walsingham, the English queen's principal secretary, had brought the system of secret information to a state of high perfection, if we may use such an expression on the subject. The Queen of Scots, the French and Spanish ambassadors, the English Roman Catholic refugees, were surrounded by his creatures, who insinuated themselves into their In October, 1584, Mary was removed from the castle of Sheffield to Wingfield; in January, 1585-6, from Wingfield to Tuthury \u2022 in January, 1586-7, from Tutbury to Chartley. 2 Cam-ien in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 501."], [29, "1586. JAMES VI. 23 confidence, pretended to join their plots, drew them on to reveal their secrets, and carried all their disco veries to their employers. Amongst these base tools of Walsingham, were Poley, a man who had found means to gain the ear and the confidence of Morgan, and been employed by him in his secret correspondence with the Catholics of England and France ; * Gilbert Gifford, a siminary priest of a good family in Stafford shire, who was also intrusted by Morgan with his secrets ; Maud, a sordid wretch, who pretended great zeal for the Catholic faith ; and some others. He was also assisted by Thomas Phelipps, a person of extraordinary skill in detecting real, and concocting false plots, by forging imaginary letters, and of equal talent in discovering the key to the most difficult and complicated ciphers. In his service, too, was one Gregory, who, by reiterated practice, had acquired the faculty of breaking and replacing seals with such nicety, that no eye could suspect the fracture.2 By means of these agents, Walsingham, about the same time that the league had been concluded between Elizabeth and the King of Scots, discovered a conspi racy for the assassination of that princess. Of this atrocious design, Ballard, a seminary priest, and Savage, an English officer who had served in the Netherlands, were the principal movers ; but Morgan, Mary's agent, undoubtedly encouraged the plot, and drew into it some of the English Catholic refugees. At the same time, the former great project for the invasion of England, the dethronement of Elizabeth, and the escape of Mary, was resumed by Spain, 1 Murdin, p. 499, Morgan to Mary. Ult.

Here, then, were two plots simultaneously carrying on ; and amongst the actors to whom the execution was intrusted, some persons were common to both, \u2014 that is, some were sworn to assist alike in the invasion and in the assassination ; others knew only of the design against the government, and had no knowledge of the darker purpose against Elizabeth. Amongst these last, up to a certain date which can be fixed, we must undoubtedly class the Scottish queen. She was fully aware of, and indeed was an active agent in, the schemes which were in agitation for the invasion of the country and her own deliverance ; 1 but she was ignorant at first of any designs against the life of her enemy.2 Whether to the last she remained so ignorant of all, has been disputed ; but in the mean time, the predicament in which she stood, as all must see, was one of extreme peril, and so the result proved. Wal singham, through his spies, became acquainted with both plots; and his fertile and unscrupulous mind, assisted and prompted by such an instrument as Phelipps, projected a scheme for involving Mary in a knowledge of both, and thus drawing her on to her ruin. Such being the general design, let us now look more minutely into the history and proceedings of the conspirators. John Savage, a Roman Catholic gentleman, who had served in the wars of the Low Countries, becom- 1 MS. State-paper Office, Morgan to Mary, a decipher in Phelipps' hand. Ult.

JAMES VI. 25 ing acquainted with some fanatical priests of the Jesuit seminary of Rheims, was induced, by their arguments, to believe that the assassination of the English queen would be a meritorious action in the sight of God. They argued, that the papal bull, by which this princess was excommunicated, was dic tated by the Holy Spirit ; aud that to slay any per son thus anathematized must be accounted an act of faith, and not of murder. Savage, thus worked upon, took a solemn vow that he would kill the queen ; and prepared to return to England for the purpose.1 Pre vious to his departure, however, John Ballard, a priest of the same seminary, and a busy agent of Morgan, returned to France, from a tour which he had made amongst the Catholics of England and Scotland. The purpose of his mission thither had been to organize the plot for the invasion of England ; the object of his return was to confer upon the same subject with Mendoza the Spanish ambassador, Charles Paget, and the other English Catholic refugees. Ballard was accompanied by Maud, the person already men tioned as a spy of Walsingham, who had deceived Ballard and Morgan, by pretending a great zeal for the Catholic cause; and through this base person the English secretary became acquainted with all their proceedings.2 Paget being consulted, argued strongly that no invasion could succeed during the lifetime of Elizabeth ; and Ballard, assuming the dis guise of a soldier, and taking the name of Captain Fortescue, or Foscue, came back to England much about the same time as Savage, whose fell purpose Morgan had communicated to him. 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 601 ; and MS.

This was known to Ballard ; and he, therefore, confidently opened to him the great scheme for the invasion of England, explained the ardour with which it had been resumed by Morgan and the Scottish queen, and exhorted him to second their efforts by every means in his power. Babington, it is certain, had been long warmly devoted to Mary. He had formed, when he was in France, an intimate friendship with Morgan ; had been introduced to Beaton the Bishop of Glas gow, her ambassador in that country ; and had returned to England with letters from both these persons, which strongly recommended him to the Scottish queen. From this time, for the period of two years, he had continued to supply her with secret intelligence, and to receive and convey her letters to her friends.1 Latterly, however, all intercourse had been broken off; whether for some private cause, or on account of the greater strictness of Mary's con finement, does not appear certain. This interruption of Mary's correspondence with Babington had, how ever, given distress to Morgan ; and most unfortu nately, as it happened for the Scottish queen, Morgan had written to her, in urgent terms, on the 9th of May, 1586, advising her to renew her secret inter course with Babington, and describing him as a gentleman on whose ability and high honour she might have the firmest reliance.2 1 Hardwicke's Papers, vol. i. p. 227. 2 Murdin, p. 513, Morgan to the Queen of Scots, May 9, 1586, or old style, April 29.

JAMES VI. \u25a011 On being sought out by Ballard, Babington evinced all his former eagerness for the service of the captive queen ; but expressed strongly the same opinion as that already given by Charles Paget, that no inva sion or rising in England could succeed as long as Elizabeth lived. Ballard then communicated to him Savage's purpose of assassination ; adding, that the gentleman who had solemnly bound himself to de spatch that princess was now in England. This revelation produced an immediate effect ; and Babing ton expressed a decided opinion that the simultaneous execution of both plots held out the fairest prospect of success. It would be dangerous, however, he said, to intrust the assassination to only one hand : it might fail, and all would be lost. He suggested, therefore, an improvement, by which the murder should be com mitted by six gentlemen of his acquaintance, of whom Savage should be one ; whilst he pointed out the best havens where foreign troops might be landed ; summed up the probable native force with which they were likely to be joined ; and demonstrated the surest plan for the escape of the Scottish queen.1 With all this Ballard was highly pleased ; and from the time when the first meeting with Babington took place,2 he and Babington employed themselves in discovering, amongst their acquaintance, such men as they deemed likely to engage in this abominable design. Three were soon procured to join with Savage : their names were Abingdon, the son of the late cofferer of the queen's household ; Barnwell, who was connected with a noble family in Ireland; and Charnock, a 1 Murdin, p. 513.

Other gen tlemen of their acquaintance were engaged to assist in the project for the invasion, and the escape of Mary ; but the darker purpose of assassination was not revealed to them.2 During all this time, Mary, on account of the strictness of her confinement under Sir Amias Paulet, had found it extremely difficult to continue her cor respondence with her friends abroad ; but she had never abandoned the project of the Spanish invasion : and on the 5th May, she addressed a letter to Charles Paget, giving minute directions regarding the likeliest method of succeeding in their common enterprise against Elizabeth. From this letter, which, though long, is highly interesting, some passages must be given. They develop the whole plot for the invasion of England, and exhibit a determination in her designs against Elizabeth, which, when known, (as they came to be by the interception of the letter,) could not fail to excite extreme resentment. \" With an infinite number of other letters in cipher, [so she addressed Paget,] I received five of yours, dated the 14th January, 16th of May, and last of July, 1585, and the 4th of February 1586.

Wherefore I desire that you should essay, either by the Lord Paget dur ing his abode in Spain, or by the Spanish ambassador, to discover clearly if the said King of Spain hath in tention to set on England.\" Mary then proceeded to state, with great force, the reasons which ought to move the Spanish king to adopt this course ; after which, she thus expressed her hopes of giving him effectual assistance : \u2014 \"Now, in case that he deliberate to set on the Queen of England, esteeming it most necessary that he assure himself also of Scotland, either to serve with him in the said enterprise, or, at the least, to hold that coun try so bridled that it serve not his enemy; I have tli ought good that you enter with the ambassador of Spain, in these overtures following ; to wit, that I shall travel by all means to make my son enter in the said enterprise ; and if he cannot be persuaded there unto, that I shall dress a secret strait league among the principal Catholic lords of that country, and their adherents, to be joined with the King of Spain, and to execute, at his devotion, what of their parts shall be thought meet for advancing of the said enterprise ; so beino- they may have such succours of men and money as they will ask ; which, I am sure, shall not be very chargeable, having men enough within the country, and little money stretching far and doing much there. Moreover,\" continued Mary, \"I shall"], [36, "30 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. dress the means to make my son be delivered in the hands of the said King of Spain, or in the pope's, as best by them shall be thought good ; but with paction and promise to set him at liberty, whensoever I shall so desire, or that after my death, being Catholic, he shall desire again to repair to this isle. * * * This is the best hostage that I and the said lords of Scot land can give to the King of Spain for performance of that which may depend on them in the said enterprise. But withal must there be a regent established in Scotland, that [may] have commission and power of me and my son, (whom it shall be easy to make pass the same, he being once in the hands of the said lords,) to govern the country in his absence ; for which office I find none so fit as the Lord Claud Hamilton, as well for the rank of his house, as for his manhood and wisdom ; and to shun all jealousy of the rest, and to strengthen him the more, he must have a council ap pointed him of the principal lords, without whom he shall be bound not to ordain any thing of importance. I should think myself most obliged to the King of Spain, that it would please him to receive my son, to make him be instructed and reduced to the Catholic religion, which is the thing in the world I most desire ; affecting a great deal rather the salvation of his soul than to see him monarch of all Europe ; and I fear much, that so long as he shall remain where he is, (amongst those that found all his greatness upon the maintenance of the religion which he professeth,) it shall never be in my power to bring him in again to the right way ; whereby there shall remain in my heart a thousand regrets and apprehensions, if I should die, to leave behind me a tyrant and persecutor of the Catholic church. \" If you see and perceive the said ambassador to"], [37, "1586.

But by your first letter, I am not of opinion that you dis cover yourself further to him, nor to other at all, until you have received answer of the King of Spain, which being conform to this designment, then may you open more to the Lord Claud ; showing him, that to assure himself of my son, and to the end (if it be possible) that things be passed, and done under his name and authority, it shall be needful to seize his person, in case that willingly he cannot be brought to this enter prise ; yea, and that the surest were to deliver him into the King of Spain's hands, or the pope's, as shall be thought best ; and that in his absence, he depute the Lord Claud his lieutenant-general and regent in the government of Scotland, which, you are assured, I may be easily persuaded to confirm and approve. For if it be possible, I will not, for divers respects, be named therein, until the extremity. * I can write nothing presently to the Lord Claud him self, for want of an alphabet between me and him, which now I send you herewith enclosed without"], [38, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 32 any mark on the back, that you may send it unto him.\"1 Here, then, was Mary's plan minutely detailed by herself; in which Spain was to \"set on England,\" as she expressed it; Lord Claud Hamilton to be made regent in Scotland ; her son, in the event of his refusal to turn Catholic, and combine against Elizabeth, to be seized, imprisoned, and coerced into obedience. The vigour and ability with which the whole is laid down, needs no comment ; and the Scottish queen omitted no opportunity to encourage her friends in that great enterprise which was now regarded as the forlorn hope for the recovery of her liberty, and the restoration of the Catholic faith in Britain.1 All this time, however, Mary had no communication with Ballard. He had been specially warned not to attempt to hold any intercourse with the queen ; and she had been informed by Morgan, in a letter written from his prison, that such an agent was in England labouring busily in her behalf, but that there were strong reasons why she should avoid, for the present, all communica tion with him. \"He followeth,\" said he, \"some matters of consequence, the issue whereof is uncertain ; wherefore, as long as these labours of his and matters do continue, it is not for your majesty's service to hold any intelligence with him at all, lest he, or his partners, be discovered, and they, by pains or other accidents, 1 MS.

Her letters, accordingly, were regularly intercepted, deciphered by Phelipps, copied, considered by Wal singham, and then forwarded to their destination.3 The English minister, therefore, was quite as well acquainted with the plot for the invasion of the realm, and the insurrection of the Roman Catholics, as the 1 Morgan to the Queen of Scots, Murdin, p. 527. 2 MS.

C"], [40, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 34 conspirators themselves. He knew, also, the desperate designs of Ballard, Babington, and his fellows, against the queen's life ; yet, as Mary had abstained from all intercourse with the conspirators, there was no evi dence to connect her with their designs. There might be presumptions against her ; (and it seems to me im possible for any one to have read Morgan's allusion to the secret designs of Ballard without having a suspicion of some dark purpose ;) but nothing had yet brought her into direct contact with Ballard or Babington. Here, then, was the difficulty ; and as Walsingham pondered over the way to remove it, it seems to have fallen out, most unhappily for the Scot tish queen, that in consequence of the advice of Mor gan, she resolved to renew her correspondence with Babington, who probably about this time had returned from France to England, bringing with him the letter of the 29th April above-mentioned.1 It has been imagined, that Mary was drawn on to renew her cor respondence with Babington by a stratagem of Wal singham's; but although Walsingham was busy and ingenious in his stratagems after the correspondence had begun, there is no proof that any measures of his led to its renewal ; and it is evident, from what has been already stated, that for this purpose no trick or stratagem was required. But, however this may be, Mary could not have adopted a more fatal step ; indeed, it was the very crisis of her fate. Hitherto, she knew only of the project for the Spanish invasion ; and, listening to the suggestions of prudence and suspicion, had connected herself in no way with Ballard and the plot against Elizabeth's life. Had she continued thus cautious, : Supra, p. 27."], [41, "1586. JAMES VI. 35 she was ignorant, and she was safe. But Babington arrived in England ; his residence lay in the near neighbourhood of Mary's prison ; Morgan had given him a letter to that princess, recommending the re newal of their intercourse. The person who then managed the secret conveyance of Mary's letters was the treacherous Gifford. He, we know, would first convey it to Walsingham to be deciphered ; it would be then forwarded to the Scottish queen. What a moment of suspense must this have been for the English secretary, who was watching, in silence and concealment, for the evidence which might convict the captive queen ! Had she suspected, or hesitated, or delayed, Morgan, who was in communication with Ballard, and likely to be soon informed of Babington having joined the plot against Elizabeth's life, might have warned her against having any communication with him, as he had done against corresponding with Ballard. But Mary, if we are to believe the letters produced on her trial, which, however, she affirmed to be forgeries, had no suspicion. She wrote to Babington, at first briefly : he, if we are to accept as genuine a copy of his letter produced at the trial, replied at great length. In his reply, the scheme for the invasion was connected with the conspiracy for the assassination of the queen. Mary again answered ; at least so it was alleged by her enemies, who produced a copy of her reply. She there gave directions for the landing of the troops and her own escape ; she alluded also to the assassination ; and in her letter, if genuine, certainly did not deprecate it. The agent who managed this secret correspondence was Gifford ; the man in whom Babington chiefly confided was Poley. Both were sold to Walsingham : every letter was thus carried first to him, deciphered by"], [42, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 15S6. 36 Phelipps, copied, and reserved for evidence ; every conversation between the conspirators was reported. At last, when all seemed ripe for execution, the signal was given ; Gifford and his base assistants dropped the mask ; Walsingham stept from behind the curtain ; Ballard and Babington were seized ; and the unfortunate captive, one moment elated with hope, and joyous in the anticipation of freedom, found herself, in the next, detected, entangled, lost. This rapid summary has been given, to bring, at one glance, under the reader's eye, the great lines in this miserable and intricate story ; and before proceeding to trace it farther, one observation must be added. From the system adopted by Walsingham, and the assistance he might derive from the unscrupulous ingenuity of Phelipps, it is clear that, if he were so base as to avail himself of it, he was in possession of a machinery by which he could make Mary appear guilty of any plot he pleased. The letters of her cor respondents, Morgan, Babington, Paget, and others, were written in cipher to her, and her replies were conveyed in cipher to them. Both fell into the hands of the English secretary ; and, at the sub sequent trial of Mary, the two long letters which proved, as was contended, the queen's accession to the plot against Elizabeth's life, were produced, \u2014 not in the originals, but in alleged copies of the deciphered documents. Nothing can be more evident than that, under such a system, Mary may have been wholly innocent, and yet may have been made to appear guilty. The real letters which passed between her and Babington, and which were never produced, may have related solely to the great project for the inva sion of England, and her escape. The copies of these letters, avowedly taken by Phelipps, Walsing-"], [43, "15S6. JAMES VI. 37 ham's servant, may have been so manufactured as to connect the invasion with the assassination of Eliza beth. We shall afterwards see that Mary asserted this was really done : but, meanwhile, let us proceed with the story. Mary had two secretaries, named Nau and Curie : the first a man of ability, intelligence, and education, but quarrelsome, and fond of political intrigue ; the second, chiefly employed as a clerk and decipherer : both of them enjoying her confidence, and intrusted with the management of her secret correspondence. It does not exactly appear when the Scottish queen received, through Babington, Morgan's letter, recom mending the renewal of her correspondence with this gentleman ; but, on the 4th July, 1586,1 Curie sent to Gifford, or to the substitute who sometimes acted for him, a packet, in which he enclosed a letter, which he begged him to convey to Anthony Babington. The letter accompanying this packet was in cipher, and in the following words : \" On Sunday last, I wrote unto you by this bearer, having received nothing from you since your letter, dated the 16th of this instant.2 I hope to have her majesty's despatch, mentioned in my foresaid, ready for to-morrow sevennight, [conform to] the appoint ment. In the mean season, her majesty prayeth you to send your foot-boy, so closely as you can, with these two little bills : the one so 3* marked, to Master Anthony Babington, dwelling most in Derbyshire, at a house of his own, within two miles of Winkfield;3 as I doubt not but you know for that in this shire 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Carle to / sGifford,] July 4, Saturday. 2 By this is meant the 16th of June. 8 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Curie to / [Gifford,] July 4, Saturday."], [44, "S8 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. he hath both friends and kinsmen ; and the other bill, without any mark, unto one Richard Hurt Mercer, dwelling in Nottinghame Tower.

It will not, however, escape an attentive reader, that the writer does not specify by whom the enclosed letter to Anthony Babington was written. It may have been from Mary, or it may possibly have been from her 1 This letter is preserved in cipher in the State-paper Office, in a most valuable collection of original papers and letters, entitled, \" Papers of Mary queen of Scots.\" The deciphered part, in Phelipps' hand, is, much of it, illegible. It is now printed, for the first time, from a decipher, by Mr. Lemon of the State-paper Office. It is singular, as that gentleman has remarked, that Curie, or Nau, in writing it, made an error in the date. In 1586, the 4th of July, Roman style, which Mary's secretaries used, was on a Friday, not a Saturday; Saturday was the 5th of July, but the writer had mistaken the day of the month. This trivial circumstance appears to me to confirm the authenticity of the letters ; and there is another instance of carelessness in it ; he speaks, although writing on the 5th July, of the 16th \" of this instant;\" evidently meaning the 16th June.

Walsingham and Burghley, indeed, afterwards alleged at the trial, and it was so pleaded, that the enclosure was a letter from the Queen of Scots to Babington ; and this enclosed letter is certainly alluded to as extant in a list drawn up by Burghley ; but if it ever existed, it is now lost. It was not brought forward at the trial, when Mary demanded to see it, and alleged that no such letter was ever written by her : a copy was all that was then produced ; and a copy of the decipher is all that we now have.1 This letter, purporting to be addressed by Mary to Babington, was as follows : \u2014 \" My very good friend, albeit it be long since you heard from me, no more than I have done from you, against my will ; yet would I not you should think I have the meanwhile, or ever will be unmindful of the effectual affection you have showed heretofore towards all that concerneth me. I have understood, that upon the ceasing of our intelligence, there were addressed unto you, both from France and Scotland, some packets for me. I pray you, if any be come to your hands, and be yet in place, to deliver them to the bearer hereof, who will make them to be safely conveyed unto me. 1 It may be added, that there is also in the State-paper Office, a copy of the same letter in cipher, made by some unknown hand, most probably Giffurd's, on the back of the small ciphered letter already quoted, of date the 4th July, enclosing to Gifford the queen's letter to Babington. It may be conjectured that Gifford, before forwarding the original to Babington, took a copy of it on the back of his own letter. This letter was deciphered for me by Mr. Lemon, and is exactly the same as that printed in the text, with the exception, that the date is thus given in the ciphered letter : \" Of June the 25th, at Chartley, by your assured good friend, Marie R.\" The long interval between June 25 and July 5, can only be accounted for by supposing that Mary, in writing to Babington, contrary to her usual practice, used the old style ; whilst Curie, or Nau, in writing to Gifford, and enclosing the queen's letter, used the new. The 25th June, old style, was exactly the 5th July, new, as there should be a difference of ten days."], [46, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 40 And I will pray God for your preservation. At Chartley, your assured good friend, Marie R.\" 1 When the packet containing this letter reached Gifford, it was immediately conveyed to Sir Amias Paulet, who transmitted it to Walsingham on the 29th June, with many regrets that it appeared to him too small to contain any very important matter. He, at the same time, informed the English secretary, that Phelipps, who was then in London, and to whom Elizabeth and Walsingham appear to have committed the management of the whole plot for the interception of Mary's letters, had written a letter to him, in which he laid down a new plan of operations, by which he hoped to succeed more surely and speedily. Paulet, however, rejected it as dangerous, and liable, by ex- citing suspicion, to break off the good course already begun.2 He added, that this was the more to be feared, as it was expected that, on the 3d of the month, \" great matter\" would come from these people. Three days after this letter of Paulet's of the 29th June,3 Mary wrote from Chartley to Morgan, inform ing him that Pietro, the name given to Gifford in their letters, at his last return from France, had brought her three letters from him, one of which regarded Babington. She stated, also, that she had 1 BIS. copy, State-paper Office, Mary to Babington, June 25. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Paulet to Walsingham, June 29, 1586. In this letter of Paulet, which is too long to quote, we obtain a clear view of the machinery and the actors in this secret correspon dence. Mary employed a brewer, who supplied the castle, and went by the name of \"the honest man,\" to receive her letters from Gifford. He carried the answers to Gifford again, or to a cousin of his, who acted as his substitute; and all the three were in the pay of Walsing ham and Paulet ; so that the letters of the queen, or her secretaries, were sure to be intercepted, sent to Walsingham, deciphered by Phelipps, and then retransmitted to Paulet, who forwarded them to their destination. .3 On the 12th July, new style, or 2d July, old."], [47, "1586.

She then added this remarkable passage regarding her intercourse with Babington : \" As to Babington, he hath both kindly and honestly offered himself and all his means, to be employed any way I would ; whereupon I hope to have satisfied him by two of my several letters since I had his. He hath seen that mine hath prevented him with all lawful excuses shown on my part of the long silence between us.\" In the conclusion of the same letter, the Scottish queen, in answer to the passage regarding Ballard, already quoted from Morgan's letter of the 4th July,1 thus spoke of him : \u2014 \u2022 \" I have heard of that Ballard of whom you write, but nothing from himself, and, therefore, have no intelligence with him.\" 2 On the day after, 13th July, Nau, Mary's secretary, wrote to Babington, informing him that his mistress had received his letters \" yesternight,\" that is, on the evening of the 12th July ;3 which letters, he added, before this bearer's return, cannot be deciphered. He then continued: \u2014 \"He (the bearer) is, within three days, to repair hither again, against which time her majesty's letter will be in readiness. In the mean time, I would not omit to show you, that there is great assurance made of Mr. Poley 's faithful serving of her majesty; and by his own letters [he] hath 1 Supra, pp. 32, 33. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, original decipher by Phelipps, Mary to Morgan, 12th July, new style, i. e. 2d July, old. 3 July 12, new style ; July 2, old."], [48, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 42 vowed and promised the same.\" But he subjoined this caution. \" As yet, her majesty's experience of him is not so great as I dare embolden you to trust him much; he never having written to her majesty but once, whereunto she hath not yet answered. * * * Let me know plainly what you understand of him. \u2014 Twelfth July, Chartley.\u2014 Nau.\"1 Although these two letters, the first from Mary to Morgan, the second from Nau to Babington, appear not in the original, but only in the decipher, which is in the handwriting of Phelipps, and must therefore be regarded with suspicion, there seems no sufficient reason for doubting their authenticity ; and they esta blish the fact, that the Scottish queen, at this time, had twice written to Babington, and meant to write again. They prove, also, that, on the 12th July, she had received letters from Babington. But with regard to the subject of his offers to her, or her reply to him, upon which depends the whole question of her guilt, all is still dark. To understand what occurred next, the reader must keep in mind, that in his secret communications with Mary, Babington sometimes remained at Lichfield in the neighbourhood of Chartley, and sometimes wrent to London, for the purpose of holding his private meetings with the conspirators, and also of visiting Secretary Walsingham, to whom, strange as it may appear, he had offered himself as a spy upon the practices of the Roman Catholic party. His object in this was evident. He believed that Walsingham knew nothing of his designs ; and hoped, under this disguise, to become acquainted with all the secret purposes of the secretary. But Walsingham was too old a diplomatist to be thus 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, original decipher by Phelipps, endorsed, Nau to Babington, July 13."], [49, "1586. JAMES VI. 43 taken in : he accepted his offers, and made his own use of them. Hitherto Babington seems to have been in London when he received, through Gifford or his substitutes, the letters from Mary ; but he now pro posed to come down to Lichfield, and communicate with her secret messenger in person. It is evident that this change made some alteration necessary on the part of Walsingham and Phelipps ; for the delay which must have occurred in having the intercepted letters sent up to London, deciphered, copied, and retransmitted to be delivered again to Babington, would have raised suspicion, and must, in all proba bility, have led to discovery. Phelipps, therefore, was sent down to Chartley,1 where, on pretence of some other business, he took up his residence with Sir Amias Paulet ; and thus no time was lost in de ciphering the intercepted letters, and no suspicion raised. In this way Walsingham trusted that he would be enabled, following out what they had begun, to draw the nets more tightly round the Scottish queeu ; and procure, at last, a clear and positive ground of conviction. Keeping this in view, the cor respondence grows more and more interesting. Phelipps left London for Chartley on the evening of the 7th July, 2 and on the way thither he met a messenger with a packet from Sir Amias Paulet to Walsingham, which, according to the directions he had received from this minister, he opened. It con tained a letter of Mary's to the French ambassador. This the decipherer carried back with him to Chart- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Phelipps to Walsingham, Chartley, July 14, 1586.

She remembered that Morgan had employed many years ago a gentle man of the same name ; but she had never seen him. Could this be the same, and was he to be trusted, or might he not be some new spy or eavesdropper of her enemies? To ascertain this, she sent a minute description of his person to Morgan.2 He must have arrived at Chartley on the 9th July, and having deciphered the intercepted packet to the French am bassador, he, on the 14th, transmitted it with this letter to Walsingham : \u2014 \" It may please your honour, the packet is presently returned, which I stayed, in hopes to send both that and the answer to Ba. 3 letter at once ; in the mean while beginning to decipher that which we had copied out before.

The poor queen carrying on a plot for her escape ; watching anxiously the fate of her letters on which all depended, and believing all safe ; whilst Phelipps, living then under the same roof, and meeting her, as he says, with a smiling countenance, was open ing every packet ; communicating her most secret thoughts to Walsingham and Elizabeth ; and weav ing, at her very elbow, the toils in which she was to be caught. On this same day, the 14th July, Sir Amias Paulet 1 Lord Claud Hamilton. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, July 14, 1586, Phelipps to Wal singham, Chartley."], [52, "1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 46 wrote to Walsingham, acquainting him that the packet sent by Mr. Phelipps had been thankfully received, with such answer given by writing as the shortness of the time would allow, and a promise made to answer more at length at the return of the honest man, which, he added, would be in three days. This packet, brought down by Phelipps, and thankfully received by Mary, appears to have contained a long letter from Babington. It described the conspiracy for the invasion of the realm, the escape of the Scot tish queen, and the assassination of Elizabeth. This letter, which was not produced at the trial, and which Mary denied having ever received, no longer exists, if it ever did exist, in the original ; but a copy, in a clerk's hand, has been preserved. Its purport was to excuse his long silence, every means of conveying his letters having been cut off since the time that she had been committed to the custody of such a Puritan as Paulet. He then gave an account of his conference with Ballard ; informed her of the intended murder of the Queen of England by six gentlemen selected for that purpose, and of his resolution to set her at the same time at liberty ; and he requested her to assign rewards to the actors in this tragedy, or to their pos terity, should they perish in the attempt.1 It is to be remembered, that this day, the 14th July, in Sir Amias's letter and Mr. Phelipps', was the 24th July according to the new style, which Mary and her secretaries, Curie and Nau, followed in their letters ; and, accordingly, we find that Curie, on the 22d July, new, or 12th July, old style, and on the 27th July, new, or 17th, old, wrote two short letters in cipher, which were deciphered by Phelipps, then at 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 603. Lingard, vol. viii. p. 205."], [53, "1586. JAMES VI. 47 Chartley. They were addressed to Gifford; and in the first, he told him, that the Queen of Scots had received his letter, dated the 12th of that instant, with its enclosure ; that she was grateful for his dili gence, but approved of his cousin Gilbert's advice, not to employ frequently a certain person to whom he had alluded. He (Curie) then added this sentence : \" If Mr. Babington be past down to the country, for whom this character 3\u00a3 shall serve in time coming, her majesty prayeth you to cause convey to him this enclosed, otherwise to stay it until you hear from her majesty again. With my next I shall do my best to satisfy you touching the other characters. God have you in protection. Of July 22d. Curle, Chartley.\" 1 In the other letter, of the 27th July, Curie wrote to the same person, or to Gilbert Gifford, much to the same purpose, informing him, that Mary had received his letter of the 25th instant ; that she commended his zeal, and begged him to have \"this enclosed surely delivered in the hands of Anthony Babington, if he were come down in the country ; otherwise to keep it still in his own hands, or his brother's, until Babington should arrive.\" He goes on to say, that, within ten days, her majesty would have a packet ready to be sent to the French ambassador by his boy, who, by the same means, might also carry the other to Babington at London, if he was not come sooner.2 Here, then, at last, is the anxiously expected packet from Mary to Babington, to which, as we have seen, Phelipps alluded in his letter of the 14th July, when he wrote to Walsingham, with such emphatic eager ness, \" We attend her very heart in the next.\" It was 1 MS. State-paper Office, cipher and decipher, July 22, Curie. Ibid. July 27, 1586."], [54, "1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 48 enclosed in the packet with this letter of Curie's of the 27th July, and was instantly pounced upon by those who were watching for it. Accordingly, on the 19th July, which, it must be recollected, is the 29th July, new style, Phelipps wrote in exultation from Chartley to Walsingham; \"It may please your honour, you have now this queen's answer to Babington, which I received yesternight. If he be in the country, the original will be conveyed into his hands, and, like enough, answer returned. I hope for your honour's speedy resolution touching his apprehension or other wise, that I may dispose of myself accordingly. I think, under correction, you have enough of him ; unless you would discover more particularities of the confederates, which may be done even in his imprison ment. If your honour mean to take him, ample com mission and charge would be given to choice persons for search of his house. It is like enough, for all her commandment, her letter will not be so soon defaced. I wish it for an evidence against her, if it please God, to inspire her majesty with the heroical courage that were meet for the avenge of God's cause, and the security of herself and this state : at least I hope she will hang Nau and Curie, who justly make Sir Amias Paulet take upon him the name she imputes to him \u2014 of a jailor of criminals. * * * I have sent you herewith of this queen's letters in the packet was last sent, those to the Bishop of Glasgow, Don Lewis, and Morgan. * * * She is very bold to make way to the great personage; and I fear he will be too forward in satisfying her for her change till he see Babington's treasons, which I doubt not but your honour hath care enough of not to discover which way this wind comes in. I am sorry to hear from London, that Babington was not yet taken,"], [55, "JAMES VI. 1586. 49 and that some searches, by forewarning, have been frustrated.\" 1 Phelipps concluded his letter, by cautioning Wal singham against one Thoroughgood, who had applied for a license to leave the country, and whom he sus pected might be Ballard under a feigned name ; and added this postscript : \" It may please your honour, by Berdon, or my man, to inform yourself whether Babington be at London or no ; which known, we will resolve presently upon return.\" Paulet also wrote briefly, but joyfully, to Walsingham. His words, he said, would be few ; the papers now sent containing matter enough for one time ; but he re joiced that \" God had blessed his labours, giving him the reward of true and faithful service ; and trusted that the queen, and her grave councillors, would make their profit of the merciful providence of God towards her highness and England.\" 2 It must here be remarked, that there seems no good reason to doubt the perfect authenticity of those two notes of Curie's, of the 22d and 27th July; and, therefore, no ground for questioning the fact, that the Queen of Scots had transmitted two several letters to Babington : neither can there be any doubt that the letters of Phelipps, written on his road to Chartley, and during his residence there, are authentic ; for they, like Curie's notes, are pre served, and prove themselves. But it is certainly remarkable, and cannot but excite suspicion, that, at this critical moment, the originals of Mary's two letters to Babington, which Phelipps undoubtedly received, and the contents of which proved, as was affirmed, Mary's knowledge of the plot against Eliza- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Phelipps to Walsingham, July 19, 1586. 2 Ibid. Paulet to Walsingham, July 20, 1586. VOL. VII. -\u00b0"], [56, "1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 50 beth's life, have both disappeared. Nay, the singu larity goes farther; for Mary sends two letters to Babinp-ton, one on the 25th, the other on the 27th ; \u00a9 \u2022 l and only one was afterwards produced against her, and that confessedly not an original. All the other letters of Curie, Morgan, Nau, Gifford, and others, in these intricate doings, have been preserved, and generally with the decipher ; but this letter, the most important of all, on which, indeed, the whole question turned, is a copy. At the trial, when this copy was produced and argued on, when Mary solemnly asserted that it was never written by her, and challenged her enemies to show the ori ginal, it was not forthcoming. It is impossible not to regard this as a suspicious circumstance, coupled with the fact already noticed, that the letter of Babington to Mary is in the same predicament, and exists only as a copy ; and this suspicion is greatly increased by an assertion of Camden, that, after intercepting and opening the Scottish queen's letter to Babington, Walsingham, and his assistant Phelipps, cunningly added to it a postscript in the same charac ters, desiring him to set down the names of the six gentlemen ; and it is likely (he observes) other things too.1 Hitherto this statement of Camden, which involves a charge of so dark a kind against Walsing ham, has rested on his bare averment, unsupported by all evidence ; but I have found recently, in the State-paper Office, a small letter written wholly in the same cipher as that of Mary's long letter to Babington, and endorsed, in the hand of Phelipps, \"The postscript of the Scottish queen's letter to Babington.\" It runs thus, and certainly gives great support to the allegation of Camden : \u2014 \"I would be 1 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 517."], [57, "1586. JAMES VI. 51 glad to know the names and qualities of the six gentlemen which are to accomplish the designment ; for that it may be I shall be able, upon knowledge of the parties, to give you some further advice necessary to be followed therein -f as also, from time to time, particularly how you proceed ; and as soon as you may, for the same purpose, who be already, and how far every one, privy hereunto.\"2 The exact bearing of this postscript, as a proof of Mary's innocence, will afterwards appear. In the mean time, it is sufficient to remark, that it goes far to establish the fact, that her letters to Babington were tampered with, and added to by Walsingham. Returning, however, to the contents of her reply, we find that Mary, in this real or pretended letter to Babington, entered fully into the details of the intended invasion. She recommended them to examine deeply, first what forces they might raise ; what captains they should appoint ; of what towns and havens they could assure themselves ; where it would be best to assemble their chief strength ; what number of foreign auxili aries they required ; what provision of money and armour ; by what means the six gentlemen deliberated to proceed ; and in what manner she should be assisted in making her escape. Having weighed all this, she recommended them to communicate the result, and their intentions, to Mendoza the Spanish ambassador, 1 After this, in the original cipher, follows this sentence scored through, but so as to be quite legible : \" And even so do I wish to be made acquainted with the names of all such principal persons, as also wo be already as also who be.\" 2 This was deciphered for me by Mr. Lemon of the State-paper Office, who has added this sentence : \" I hereby declare, that the above is a true and literal decipher of the document in the State-paper Office in cipher, endorsed by Phelipps, The Postscript of the Scottish Queen's letter to Babington.

She then expressed herself in these remarkable words : \u2014 \" Affairs being thus prepared, and forces in readi ness, both without and within the realm, then shall it be time to set the six gentlemen to work ; taking order, upon the accomplishing of their design, I may be suddenly transported out of this place, and that all your forces, in the same time, be on the field to meet me. * * * Nor for that there can be no certain day appointed of the accomplishing of the said gentlemen's designment, to the end that others may be in readi ness to take me from hence, I would that the said gentlemen had always about them, or, at the least, at court, four stout men furnished with good and speedy horses, for, as soon as the said design shall be exe cuted, to come with all diligence, to advertise thereof those that shall be appointed for my transporting ; to the end that, immediately thereafter, they may be at the place of my abode, before that my keeper can have advice of the execution of the said design, or at least before he can fortify himself within the house, or carry me out of the same. It were necessary to despatch two or three of the said advertisers by divers ways, to the end that if one be staid, the other may come through ; and at the same instant, were it also needful, to assay to cut off the post's ordinary ways. This is the plat which I find best for this enterprise, and the order whereby you should conduct the same for our common securities. * * * I shall assay,\" she continued, \" that at the same time that the work shall"], [59, "JAMES VI. 15SG. 53 be in hand in these parts, to make the Catholics of Scotland arise, and to put my son in their hands ; to the effect that from thence our enemies here may not prevail to have any succour.\" She then added this caution, little believing that, in the moment she was writing, her cause had been betrayed, \" Take heed of spies and false brethren that are amongst you, speci- ally of some priests already practised by our enemies for your discovery ; and in any wise, keep never any paper about you that in any sort may do harm ; for from like errors have come the condemnation of all such as have suffered heretofore.\" * * * In the last place, the queen informed Babington, that for a long time past, she had been a suitor to have the place of her confinement changed, and that Dudley castle had been suggested, to which place it was not unlikely she might be removed by the end of summer. She then observed, \" If I stay here, there is for that pur- pose [her escape] but one of these three means follow- ing to be looked [to.] The first, that at one certain day, appointed, in my walking abroad on horseback on the moors, betwixt this and Stafford, where ordinarily you know very few people do pass, a fifty or threescore men, well horsed and armed, come to take me there, as they may easily, my keeper having with him ordina- rily but eighteen or twenty horsemen, only with dags.1 The second mean is, to come at midnight, or soon after, to set fire in the barns and stables, which you know are near to the house ; and whilst that my guardian's servants shall run forth to the fire, your company (having every one a mark whereby they may know one another under night) might surprise the house, where, I hope, with the few servants I have about me, I were able to give you correspondence.

God Almighty have you in protection ! \u2014 Your most assured friend for ever. 3\u00a3 Fail not to burn this present quickly.\" 1 As soon as Walsingham had procured this letter, which directly implicated Mary, not only in the con spiracy for the invasion, but proved, by inference, her assent to the plot for the assassination of the English queen, he determined to secure Ballard and his fellows on the first opportunity. It was necessary, however, to act with extreme caution. If one of the conspira tors was laid hold of before another, the rest might 7 \u00a9 take alarm and escape, the news reach Chartley, and Mary, whose papers he had resolved to seize, might order every thing to be destroyed. He was too acute not to anticipate great difficulty even after all he had done and intercepted. The letters of Mary to Morgan and to Babington were not in the queen's hand, but in cipher, and were written by her secretaries, Nau or Curie. She might deny them. The small notes 1 MS. copy, State-paper Office."], [61, "JAMES VI. 1586. 55 enclosing these letters were also in cipher, and con fessedly from Curie and Nau. She might assert that they had written them without her orders, and un known to her.1 The only way of completing the proof was to search her repositories for the original minutes or rough drafts of the.se letters, and to seize Curie and Nau, and compel them to confess all they knew. Hence the extreme danger of giving any alarm at Chartley, which might lead to the destruction of the one, or the escape of the other. Babington apparently was still unsuspicious, and in constant communication with Walsingham. Contrary to his original intention, he had given up his plan of going down to Lichfield, and had remained in London, where he held secret meetings with Ballard, Savage, Poley, Dun, and the other conspirators. In these difficult circumstances, Walsingham was compelled to act rapidly, and yet with caution. He sent for Phelipps, (July 22d,) who remained still at Chartley, busy in the task of deciphering the last letters intercepted, addressed to Mendoza and the French ambassador.2 Elizabeth, he said, would thank him, on his arrival, with her own lips ; but as Babington was still in London, he must bring with him the original letter of Mary to this traitor. It was not, however, brought up by the decipherer till the 27th or 28th, and was then conveyed to Ba bington by a secret messenger, to whom he promised to have the answer ready by the 2d of August.3 And here, in passing, it seems very important to remark, 1 The reader will observe, that I am here reasoning on the assump tion that Mary's letters to Babington, as they appear in the copies, were authentic. 8 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Phelipps, July 22, 1586, Papers of Mary. 8 Ibid. Paulet to Walsingham, July 29, 1686, Papers of Mary."], [62, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 56 that the original letter of Mary to Babington, the letter which brought home to her the knowledge of the conspiracy against the queen's life, and which has been already fully quoted, was confessedly in the hands of Phelipps the decipherer from the evening of the 18th July, when he intercepted it,1 to the 27th or 28th of the same month, a period of nine days at the least. There was ample time, therefore, to make any changes or additions which might seem necessary for the im plication of the Scottish queen. So far with Walsing ham all had proceeded well. Babington had received the important letter, and promised his answer. Mean while, the task of arresting Ballard had been committed to Milles, one of Walsingham's secretaries ; but this conspirator used so many devices, and glided about so mysteriously, often changing his lodging, that for some time he eluded all their vigilance. At last he was seized and lodged in the Counter, a prison in Wood Street.2 Phelipps, however, began to be in great alarm about Babington, who had now become suspi cious that they were discovered, and instead of keeping his appointment for the 2d August, had ridden out of town, none knew where. The truth seems to have been, that the unhappy man was in an agony of sus pense. He had discovered Maud's treachery, and trembled for their plot being on the point of detection. If he fled the cause was lost. If he remained, it might be to perish miserably. He at last resolved to write to Mary, and returned with the vain hope of still over reaching Walsingham. His letter to the Scottish queen, dated the 3d August, was intercepted like the rest.3 It informed her of their danger, but conjured 1 Supra, p. 48. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Milles to Walsingham, Aug. 4, 1586. 3 Ibid.

It was God's cause, he said, and that of the church : it must succeed ; and they had sworn to perform it or die. He added, that he would send the answer to her propositions, and their final determination, in the next.1 This promised letter, however, he was des tined never to write. He returned to London on the 4th August, the day on which Ballard was appre hended ; heard the fatal news ; attempted a feeble remonstrance with Walsingham ; was reassured by the crafty excuses of that veteran intriguer for a few hours ; again doubted and trembled ; and at last, eluding the men who were set to watch his motions, escaped, in disguise, with some of his companions, and concealed himself in St. John's Wood, near the city. Walsingham appears hitherto, in these plots and counterplots, to have acted on his own responsibility ; but it had at length become necessary to determine on Mary's fate ; and with this view, he now, for the first time, laid before Elizabeth, in their full extent, the appalling discoveries which he had made ; the conspi racy for the invasion of the realm ; and that also against her own life. The queen was thunderstruck. She saw her extreme danger. The plot was evidently proceeding in her own dominions, in Scotland, in Spain, perhaps in France ; yet, though its general purpose was clear, its particular ramifications, especially in Scotland, and at Rome, were still unknown. She now recalled to mind Randolph's solemn and warning letter, written from Edinburgh some months before this.2 The persons to whom he alluded must be fellow-conspirators of Ballard ; and this man, who seemed the principal agent, could probably tell all. 1 MS. letter, copy, State-paper Office, Babington to the Queen of Scots, August 3, 1586. * Supra, vol. vi. p. 458."], [64, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 58 Walsingham had used the precaution of apprehending him, simply on the charge of being a seminary priest, and, as such, interdicted by law from entering England. Elizabeth, under these circumstances, commanded Walsingham to keep every thing still to himself. It was not time yet, she said, to consult the council ; she and he must act alone ; and it was her advice that he should first bribe some of Ballard's confidants, if he knew of any such, and thus elicit his secrets. She suggested, also, that if any cipher used by the traitor in his correspondence had come to his hands, he might employ it to extract from him the particulars of the plot against her life. It is from Walsingham's answer to this proposition of the queen that the above parti culars are drawn ; and the letter itself is too interest ing to be omitted.

On the 3d of August, Mr. Waad, a privy-councillor, posted from London ; met Paulet in the fields near Chartley, and held a secret consulta tion. Its result was soon seen. The Scottish queen was still fond of the chase. She had cheerfully boasted to Morgan, in one of her letters, that when her enemies were representing her as bedrid she was able to handle her cross-bow, and follow a stag.4 On the morning of the 8th August, her keeper, Paulet, invited her to hunt in the neighbouring park of Tixall, belonging to Sir Walter Ashton : she accepted, rode from Chartley, with a small suite, amongst whom were Nau and Curie her secretaries, and had not proceeded far, when Mr Thomas Gorges encountered them, and riding up to the queen, informed her of the discovery of the con spiracy ; adding, that he had received orders not to 1 So in original. 2 MS.

At the same instant, Nau and Curie were seized, kept separate from each other, and hurried away, under a strong guard, to London. Mary was completely taken by surprise. She broke into violent reproaches, and called upon her suite to defend their mistress from the traitors who dared to lay hands on her. But a moment's reflection convinced her they were far too weak for resistance ; and she suffered Paulet to lead her to Tixall.1 Here, by Elizabeth's orders, she was kept a close prisoner, secluded from her servants, refused the ministry of her private chap- lain, served by strangers, deprived of the use of writing materials, and completely cut off from all intelligence. Whilst this scene of arrest was acting in the fields, Mr. Waad had arrived at Chartley, where he broke open her repositories, seized her caskets, papers, letters, and ciphers ; and was, soon after, joined by Paulet, who took possession of her money. All was then packed up and sealed, preparatory to being sent to Elizabeth, who now appears to have directed every step. This princess was overjoyed at the success which had attended the arrest of Mary : she wrote to Paulet, addressing him as the most faithful of her subjects ; promised him a reward \" non omnibus datum ;\" and soon after sent a new message, eagerly desiring him to write the whole story of every thing done to Mary ; not that she suspected (as she said) he had omitted any part of his duty, but \"simply that she might take pleasure in the reading thereof.\" 2 Above all things, Elizabeth urged the safe keeping, 1 MS.

JAMES VI. 61 and immediate transmission to her, of the caskets found in the Queen of Scots' repositories. These, and the things contained in them, she declared, were, in her esteem, of far greater value than Nau or Curie ; and, not content with a written message, she deputed a special envoy from Windsor to look after these treasures and bring them at once.1 Shortly before this, Elizabeth had a new triumph in the seizure of Babington and his companions. Till now, they had escaped the officers who were in pursuit; but driven at last by hunger from the woods into the open country, they were apprehended near Harrow, and carried in triumph to London, amid the shouts and execration of the citizens. There was no want of evidence against them, and their own confessions cor roborated all ; but after the day for their trials had been fixed, and every thing seemed ready, the English queen suddenly caught alarm, from the idea, that if the charge made by the crown lawyers, and the evi dence of the witnesses, deeply implicated Mary, her own life was not safe. Elizabeth had not yet resolved on the trial of the Scottish queen, and the evidence against her was most imperfect. Her two secretaries, Nau and Curie, had as yet confessed nothing which materially involved their mistress. No original minutes of the letters to Babington had been found.2 Even if Mary's trial were to take place, it was clear that a considerable interval must elapse between her arraign ment and the execution of the conspirators ; and, in this interval, what might not be attempted against her 1 Could it be that the queen expected to find, amongst these trea sures, the famous casket, containing the letters of Bothwell, which she had made such strenuous exertions to get into her possession in 1683 ?

Though some of the leading conspirators were taken, yet many desperate men might still be lurking about court; and so intensely did she feel upon this subject, that, on the evening of the 12th September, the very day before the trial, she sent repeated messages and letters to Burghley, command ing that, in the \"indictment,\" and in the evidence, there should be no enlargement of the Queen of Scots' crime. It was her favourite, Sir Christopher Hatton, the vice-chamberlain, who transmitted these wishes to Burghley ; and the reason he gave was, that Eliza beth felt that it might be perilous to herself, if any thing were given in evidence which touched Mary \" criminallv for her life.\" x Amid these alarms the trials proceeded ; and Ba bington, Ballard, and Savage, with the rest of the conspirators, being found guilty, were executed on the 20th and 21st of September, with a studied cruelty, which it is revolting to find proceeded from Elizabeth's special orders. She had at first suggested to her council, that some \" new device\" should be adopted to enhance their tortures, and strike more terror into the people ; to which it was answered by Burghley, that the manner of the execution prescribed by law, would be fully as terrible as any other new device, if the hangman took care to \" protract the action\" to the extremity of their pains, and to the sight of the multitude who beheld it.2 The executioner, by special direction, did so : but the sight of seven men cut up alive, after being partially strangled, was found to excite the 1 MS. letter, Burghley to Sir Christopher Hatton, September 12, 1586, discovered by Mr. Leigh, who is at present preparing a work on Babington's conspiracy. 3 Lingard, vol. viii. 8vo edition, pp. 215, 216."], [69, "1586. JAMES VI. 63 rage and disgust of the multitude ; and next day the second seven were permitted to be executed after a milder fashion.1 But, leaving these cruel scenes, we must turn to the unhappy Mary. On the 25th August, she was removed from Tixall, to her former residence at Chartley, under the charge of Sir Amias Paulet, and a body of gentlemen of the neighbourhood, to the number of a hundred and forty horse. This strong escort Elizabeth thought necessary, from the suspicion that many commiserated Mary's fate; and, indeed, Walsingham's letters betrayed considerable uneasiness on the subject. But his apprehensions were needless ; for nothing could now be more utterly helpless than the situation of the royal captive. She had been deprived, during her stay at Tixall, of all her servants, and was surrounded by strangers. When seen coming from the gate of the castle, a crowd of poor people assembled round her ; and on some asking alms, she answered, weeping, that she had nothing to give. \" All has been taken from me,\" said she : \" I am a beggar as well as you.\" Then turning to Sir Walter Ashton, the pro prietor of Tixall, and the other gentlemen, she again burst into tears, exclaiming, \" Good gentlemen, I am not witting of any thing intended against the queen.\" On reaching Chartley castle, her old prison, an affecting incident occurred. The wife of Curie her secretary, had been confined during the interval between Mary's removal and her return; and before going to her own chamber, the queen, with the affectionate consideration which she always showed to her servants, went to visit the mother and child. It was a female ; and turning to Paulet, who stood by, she begged him, since her 1 Camden in Rennet, vol. ii. p. 518."], [70, "6i HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. own priest was removed from her, to suffer his chaplain to christen the babe, and give it the name of Mary. It might have been imagined that Sir Amias, who constantly talked of Catholicism as idolatry, and believed Protestantism to be the truth, would have welcomed the proposal ; but he peremptorily refused. The queen said nothing at the time ; but retiring for a short season, came again into the room, and taking the infant on her knee, dipped her hand in a basin of water, and sprinkling its face, said, \" Mary, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" Paulet, in a letter to Walsingham, which described the scene, affected to be shocked at a scandal which he might himself so easily have pre vented. He Was ignorant, probably, that the Catholic church, under such circumstances, permitted lay bap tism ; but the man was of a perverse, churlish temper \u2014 a strict Puritan, and, as his letters often showed, more remarkable for his zeal than his charity.1 Mary now proceeded to her own apartment ; and on reaching it, the keys of the chamber, and of her coffers, were offered to one of her servants, who had been at length suffered to attend on her : but the queen commanded him not to receive them ; and bade Mr. Darrel, one of Paulet's assistants, open the door. He did so ; and on entering, finding her papers seized, and her repositories empty, she expressed herself with deep indignation ; declaring that there were two things which the Queen of England could never take from her, \u2014 her English blood, and her Catholic religion. She then added, that some of them might yet be sorry for this outrage ; a threat which ruffled and disturbed Paulet.2 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Paulet to Walsingham, August 22, 1586.

JAMES VI. 65 All the efforts of Elizabeth and Walsingham were now directed to collect conclusive evidence against the Scottish queen. Her secretaries, Nau and Curie, were in their hands, and repeatedly examined ; but, up to the 3d of September, their confessions did not mate rially involve their mistress.1 The evidence connect ing her with the general conspiracy for the invasion of the realm was perfectly clear ; her correspondence with France, Spain, and Scotland, and her secret practices with the Catholics in England, was fully made out. But this was not considered enough ; and Walsingham, in despair, wrote to Phelipps, then at Chartley, that Nau and Curie would by no means be brought to confess that they were acquainted with the letters that passed between their mistress and Ba bington : adding, \" I would to God that these minutes could be found !\"2 It is evident that, by these minutes, the secretary meant such rough drafts, or notes, of Mary's letters to Babington, as he conjectured might be preserved in her repositories : and here we have a clear admission that, unless such were found, the evi dence against the Scottish queen was considered in complete. At this moment of perplexity and difficulty Burghley wrote to Sir Christopher Hatton, suggesting, that it was terror for themselves that kept the Scot tish queen's secretaries silent : they refused, as he thought, to implicate their mistress, because it might bring ruin on themselves ; \" but,\" he added, \" assure them of safety, and then we shall have the whole truth from them. Surely, then,\" said he, (to use his own revolting expressions,) \"they will yield in writing somewhat to confirm their mistress's crime, if they were persuaded that themselves might scape, and the 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Phelipps, Sept. 3, 1586. * Ibid.

On the same day (4th September) Walsingham wrote to Phelipps, who was then at court. \" It was evident,\" he said, \" that Mary's minutes were not extant.\" He directed him, therefore, to seek access to Elizabeth, and persuade her to promise some extraordinary favour to Curie, who had admitted, in general terms, his mistress's correspondence with Babington, but obstinately refused to be more explicit.2 Both this person, Curie, and his brother secretary, Nau, were, in truth, in a difficult dilemma. If they acknowledged that the correspondence between the queen and Babington was in their handwriting, whether the letters were in written characters or in cipher, or whether they related simply to the project of invasion, or included an allusion to the plot against Elizabeth's life, they stood convicted of treason. If they remained obstinate, they had before them the dreadful alternative of the Tower and the torture. They acted as might have been expected in such cir cumstances : at first denied every thing, and at length made a partial admission, which increased the pre sumptions, but was not conclusive, against the Scot tish queen. On the 5th September, the day after Burghley had written to Hatton, Nau, actuated no doubt by Hatton's promises of escape and pardon, described minutely the manner in which Mary managed her secret correspondence. The queen, he said, would 1 MS. letter, Burghley to Sir Christopher Hatton, Sept. 4, 1586 ; discovered by Mr. Leigh.

It was her usual practice to dictate the points which she was pleased should be written ; he took them down, read them over to her, drew out the letters, again submitted them for correction, and finally delivered them to be put into cipher and disposed of according to her orders. In this manner were written the intercepted letters of the queen to the Archbishop of Glasgow, Charles Paget, and the Spanish ambassa dor: but as to the letter to Babington, he declared that his mistress had delivered it to him for the most part written in her own hand.1 It was Curie, he said, who finally translated and put the letters in cipher ; and this same process had taken place with this letter as with the rest. This evidence was far from being sufficiently explicit or satisfactory ; and various at tempts were made to amend it. Burghley now threat ened Nau with the Tower ; 2 and the terror of his commitment drew from him, on the 10th September, a long declaration, addressed privately to Elizabeth ; which Burghley threw aside as of no importance, as it did not charge the Scottish queen with any direct accession to the conspiracy for Elizabeth's death, but simply with having previously known that such a plot existed.3 The queen, Nau affirmed, had neither in vented nor desired, nor in any way meddled with this plot, but had confined herself to the designs for 1 MS.

It is quite clear that this declaration, wrung out from Nau, did not corro borate, but rather contradicted, the alleged letter of the Scottish queen to Babington, \u2014 a sufficient reason why Burghley should have disregarded it. After an interval of eleven days, Nau and Curie were again examined before the Lord Chancellor, Burghley, and Sir Christopher Hatton. Babington and his com panions had been executed the day before : on that same morning seven more conspirators had been drawn to Tyburn. In the interval between this examination and their last, Ballard had been so \" racked\" that he was carried to the bar and arraigned in a chair;1 and it was hoped that, under the influence of terror for a similar fate, the secretaries would declare all. Of this last examination no perfect account has been preserved : but in an original minute drawn up by Phelipps, it is stated that Nau confessed that Curie had deciphered Babington's letter to Mary : that he (Nau) afterwards took down, from her dictation, the points of her answer ; in which his mistress required Babington to consider what forces they might raise, what towns they might assure, where were the fittest places to assemble, what foreign forces were required, what money they should demand, what were the means by which the six gentlemen deliberated to pro ceed, and in what manner she should be gotten out of the hold she was in.2 Nau added, that there was one other clause of his mistress's letter to Babineton, 1 MS.

This statement of Nau was corro borated by Curie ; who added, that his mistress wished him to burn the English copy of the letters sent to Babington.1 It was now considered that there was sufficient evidence against the Queen of Scots, and there only remained the question of the mode of trial; nor was this long in deliberation. Elizabeth held a special consultation with Burghley on the 24th September ;2 and after considerable discussion and delay in the privy council, a commission was issued on the 5th October to thirty-six individuals, including peers, privy councillors, and judges, directing them to inquire into and determine all offences committed against the statute of the 27th of the queen, either by Mary, daughter and heiress of James the Fifth, late King of Scotland, or by any other person whomsoever.3 Chasteauneuf, the French ambassador, having heard of these proceedings, demanded, in the name of his master, that the Scottish queen should have counsel assigned her for her defence ; but this was peremp torily refused : and on the 6th of October, Sir Amias Paulet, Sir Walter Mildmay, and Mr. Barker a notary, waited on Mary at Fotheringay castle, in Northamp tonshire, to which place she had been removed from Chartley, and delivered her a letter from their mis tress. It stated briefly and severely, that, to her great 1 Hardwicke Papers, vol. i. p. 237. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Burghley to Phelipps, September 24, 1586. 3 Lingard, vol. viii. p. 222."], [76, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 70 and inestimable grief, she understood that Mary pretended, with great protestations, to have given no assent to, and even to have been ignorant of any attempt against her state and person. It asserted, that the contrary would be verified by the clearest proofs : that she had, therefore, sent some of her chief and ancient noblemen to charge her with having con sented to that most horrible and unnatural conspiracy lately discovered ; that, living as she did within the protection of, and thereby subject to her laws, she must abide by the mode of trial which they enjoined ; and she, therefore, required her to give credit to those noblemen who held her commission under the great seal, and make answer to whatever they objected against her.1 Mary read the English queen's letter with great composure. \" I cannot but be sorry,\" said she, \" that my sister is so ill informed against me, as to have treated every offer made by myself or my friends with neglect. I am her highness's nearest kinswoman, and have forewarned her of coming dangers ; but have not been believed: and, latterly, 'the association' for her majesty's preservation, and the act passed upon it, have given me ample warning of all that is intended against me. It was easy to be foreseen, that every danger which might arise to my sister from foreign princes, or private persons, or for matter of religion, would be laid to my charge. I know I have many enemies about the queen. Witness my long cap tivity, the studied indignities I have received, and now this last association between my sister and my son, in which I was not consulted, and which has been concluded without my consent. As to my answer 1 MS. draft, State-paper Office, October 5, 1 586,"], [77, "1586. JAMES VI. 71 to the accusation now made,\" continued Mary, \" her majesty's letter is indeed written after a strange sort. It seems to me to partake of the nature of a command ; and it is, perhaps, expected that I am to reply as a subject. What !\" she then exclaimed, catching fire at the word, whilst her eye flashed, and the colour for a brief space rose in her cheek, \" does not your mistress know that I was born a queen ? and thinks she that I will so far prejudice my rank and state, the blood whereof I am descended, the son who is to follow me, and the foreign kings and princes whose rights would be wounded through me, as to come and answer to such a letter as that ? Never ! Worn down as I may appear, my heart is great, and will not yield to any affliction. But why discuss these matters ? Her majesty knows the protestation I have once before made to the Lord Chancellor and Lord De la Ware ; and by that I still abide. I am ignorant of the laws and statutes of this realm ; I am destitute of counsel ; I know not who can be my competent peers ; my papers have been taken from me ; and nobody dareth, or will speak in my behalf, though I am innocent. I have not procured or en couraged any hurt against your mistress. Let her convict me by my words, or by my writings. Sure I am, neither the one nor the other can be produced against me : albeit, I am free to confess, that, when my sister had rejected every offer which I made, I remitted myself, and my cause, to foreign princes.\" 1 A few days after this spirited and dignified answer was reported to Elizabeth, the thirty-six commis sioners arrived at Fotheringay, and chose a deputation from their number to wait upon the queen ; who, after 1 MS.

Into the clear and convincing reasons which she alleged for this proceeding it is unnecessary to enter, although it is impossible not to be struck with the spirit, ability, and talent, with which, unbefriended and unassisted by any one, she held her ground against the subtlety and perseverance of her assailants. On one of these occasions, turning to the Lord Chancellor Bromley, she requested him to explain the meaning of that pas sage in the Queen of England's letter, which affirmed that she was subject to the laws of England, and lived under the queen's protection. \" I came,\" said she, \" into England to request assistance, and I was instantly imprisoned. Is that protection?\" Bromley was taken by surprise, and contented himself by an evasion. \" The meaning of their royal mistress,\" he said, \" was plain ; but, being subjects, it was not their part to interpret it.\" 1 Elizabeth was immediately informed of this determined refusal of Mary. She learned, at the same time, the resolution of her com missioners to hear the evidence, and pronounce sentence, although the accused declined to plead ; and she wrote privately to Burghley, the lord treasurer, commanding him and the other commissioners not to pronounce sentence till they had repaired to her pre sence and made a report of the whole proceedings.2 It would have been well for Mary had she adhered to this first resolution ; but some expressions of Sir Christopher Hatton, the vice-chamberlain, made a deep impression upon her. He had insinuated that her 1 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 521. 2 MS. letter, copy, British Museum, Caligula, C. ix. sol. 332. The English queen to Lord Burghley, October 12. MS.

JAMES VI. 73 declining to answer would be interpreted as an admis sion of guilt ; he implored her to remember, that, even if she refused to appear before the commissioners, (for hitherto Mary had received their deputation in her private chamber,) they must proceed against her in absence ; and, at the same moment, she received a brief and menacing note from Elizabeth, in which severity, if she remained obstinate, was blended art fully with a promise of favour, should she relent. It was in these words : \u2014 \" You have in various ways attempted to deprive me of my life, and to bring ruin on my kingdom by shedding of blood. I have never proceeded so hardly against you ; but, on the contrary, have cherished and preserved you as faithfully as if you were my own self. Your treasons will be proved and made manifest to you in that place where you now are. For this reason, it is our pleasure that you answer to the nobility and barons of my kingdom as you would do to myself were I there in person ; and as my last in junction, I charge and command you to reply to them. I have heard of your arrogance ; but act candidly, and you may meet with more favour. \u2014 Elizabeth.\"1 We may imagine the bitter smile with which the royal captive read this letter, in which Elizabeth, in the nineteenth year of her imprisonment, took credit to herself for the kindness and protection she had extended to Mary. But there was a menace in its tone which shook her resolution : the last sentence held out a hope of favour : she had no one to advise with ; and after a night of much suspense and trouble, she consented to appear before the commissioners. 1 This is translated from the French of Chasteauneuf, (Life of Thomas Egerton, Lord Chancellor, p. 86,) who says he translates it word for word from the English original.

It bore the arms of Eng land only, and Mary was not suffered to occupy it. On each side of the room were benches for the com missioners. On one hand sat the Lord Chancellor Bromley, the Lord High Treasurer Burghley, with the Earls of Oxford, Kent, Derby, Worcester, Rutland, Cumberland, Warwick, Pembroke, aud Lincoln ; on the other, the Lords Abergavenny, Zouch, Morley, Stafford, Grey, Lumley, and other peers. Near to these were the knights of the privy council, Crofts, Hatton, Walsingham, Sadler, Mildmay, and Paulet.

On this day, at nine in the morning, Mary, attended by a guard of halberdiers, and leaning on Sir Andrew Melvil and her physician, entered the court. She was dressed in black, with a veil of white lawn thrown over her. One of her maids of honour carried her train, another a chair covered with crimson velvet, another a footstool ; and as she walked to her seat, it was observed that she was lame and required support.2 1 Howel, 1173. 2 British Museum, copy, Caligula, C. ix. sol. 333.

JAMES VI. 75 On coming into the middle of this august assembly, the queen bowed to the lords : then observing that her chair was not allowed to be placed under the canopy of state, but lower, and at the side, she ap peared to feel the indignity. \" I am a queen,\" said she, looking proudly and resentfully for a moment ; \" I have married a King of France ; and my seat ought to be there.\" But the feeling was brief ; and her features assumed again their melancholy cast, as she regarded the multitude of peers, statesmen, and judges. \" Alas ! \" said she, \" here are many counsel lors, and yet there is not one for me.\"1 Having then seated herself with great dignity, the Lord Chancellor stood up and declared, that the queen's majesty had at last determined to bring her to trial, in consequence of the practices used by her against her life ; that she was not moved to this by personal fear, or from any malice, but because, if she failed to do so, she would be guilty of neglecting the cause of God, and of bearing the sword in vain. He was followed by Burghley the lord treasurer,' who requested her to hear their commission, which was read by the clerk. On its conclusion, Mary rose up and answered, that it was well known to all now present, that she had come into England to require assistance ; and, contrary to all law and justice, had been made a prisoner. As for any commission empowering them to bring her to trial, no one could grant it, because no one was her superior. She was a free princess, an anointed queen, subject to none but God ; she had already delivered a protestation to this effect, and she desired her ser vants to bear witness that her answers were now 1 Chasteauneuf to Henry the Third, from the king's library at Paris, October 30, 1 586 ; printed in Life of Lord Chancellor Egerton, p. 86."], [82, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 76 made under this protestation.1 Sergeant Gawdy spoke next ; entered into a narrative of the whole plot ; and brought forward the arguments, by which (he contended) it must be apparent to all, that the Scottish queen was acquainted with the conspiracy against the life of Elizabeth. He explained Ballard's dealing with Morgan and Paget in France, the con spiracy for the invasion of England, and his repair to that country for the purpose of completing the plot ; he adverted to the transactions between Ballard and Babington, to the formation of the new conspiracy against the life of the English queen ; to the renewal of the correspondence between Mary and Babington, which took place at this moment ; and he concluded, by contending that she had approved of the plot, had promised her assistance, and pointed out the readiest mode for its execution.2 To this Mary answered, that she had never seen Anthony Babington, nor received any letter from him, nor herself written any to him ; that she knew nothing of Ballard, and had never relieved him ; as for the Catholics of England, they were oppressed, and took many things hardly. This she knew, and had represented it to the queen her sister, imploring her to take pity on them. She acknowledged, also, that she had received offers of assistance from anony mous correspondents, but she had not embraced such offers ; and how was it possible for a captive, shut up in prison, to search out the names or the inten tions of unknown persons, or to hinder what they attempted ? It was possible that Babington had written such a letter as he described, but let them 1 Camden, vol. ii. of Rennet, p. 522. 2 MS. British Museum, Caligula, C. ix. sol. 333. Howel's State Trials, vol. i. pp. 1171, 1182."], [83, "JAMES VI. 1586. 77 prove that it had come into her hands ; 1 and as for her own letters, let them produce them, and she would know what to answer. Copies of the letter from Babington to the Queen of Scots, and of Mary's alleged answer, were then read ; Babington's written confession was also quoted, besides the confessions of Dun, Titchbourne, and Bal lard, three of his fellow conspirators ; and it was con tended by the Attorney-general Puckering, and by the Lord Treasurer Burghley, that nothing could be clearer than the evidence thus adduced, of direct connivance and approval. Mary, with great readiness, replied, that all this evidence was second-hand, or hearsay. They spoke of the letters which she had received, of the answers she had sent ; and they brought forward copies of a long letter from a man whom she had never seen, and a detailed answer, point by point, which she had never written. Was this garbled and manufactured evidence to be produced against her ? 2 Let them produce the originals of these letters, if such originals ever existed. If Babington's letter was in cipher, as was alleged, she would then be able to compare the cipher with the copy now before them, to test the one by the other, and to discover whether it really was written in her alphabet or secret cipher, of which it was possible that her enemies might, by some treachery or other, have procured a copy. And as for her alleged letter to Babington, if it too was written in cipher, and the original had been inter cepted by them, why was it not now produced ? If she was entitled to call for the original of Babington's 1 Camden, p. 522. 2 Avis de ce qui a este faict en Angleterre par Monsieur de Bel lievre sur les affaires de la Royne D'Escosse.

She would then be able to examine it, to disprove it, and to detect the fraud which had been practised against her. At present she must be con tented with a simple and solemn asseveration that she had not written the letters which had been now read, and that she was guiltless of any plot against the life of the Queen of England. \" I do not deny,\" said she, weeping, \" that I have longed for liberty, and earnestly laboured to procure it. Nature impelled me to do so ; but I call God to witness, that I have never conspired the death of the Queen of England, or consented to it. I confess that I have written to my friends, and solicited their as sistance in my escape from her miserable prisons, in which she has now kept me a captive queen for nine teen years ; but I never wrote the letters now pro duced against me. I confess, too, that I have written often in favour of the persecuted Catholics ; and had I been able, or even now at this moment were I able, to save them from their miseries by shedding my own blood, I would have done it ; and would now do it : but what connexion has this with any plot against the life of the queen ? and how can I answer for the dan gerous designs of others, which are carried on without my knowledge? It was but lately,\" she added, \" that I received a letter from some unknown persons, entreat ing my pardon if they attempted any thing without my knowledge.\" x To this Burghley, who had taken all along a most active part against her, undertook to reply ; insisting strongly on the written confession of Babington, and 1 Avis de Monsieur Bellievre, p. 103. Camden, p. 523."], [85, "1586. JAMES VI. 79 the declarations of her own secretaries, Curie and Nau. This confession, and these declarations, subscribed by the parties themselves who made them, were now on the table ; and they proved, he said, in the clearest manner, the correspondence between the queen and Babington. The whole history of it was developed point by point; it was opened by the brief notes written sometimes by Curie, sometimes by Nau ; it was they who had deciphered the letters of Babington, and com municated their contents to their mistress. Nay, the exact manner had been specified, in which the answer had been prepared by Nau. It was composed partly from minutes by the queen, and from verbal dictation ; it was written out at length in French, revised by Mary, translated and put into cipher by Curie, and then secretly sent to its destination. The letters also of the Scottish queen to Englefield, of a date as far back as 9th October, 1584, proved, as he said, that the great plot for the invasion of England, was then in agitation ; her letter to Charles Paget, on the 21st of May last, (1586.) showed its resumption at that period ; the letter of Charles Paget to the Scot tish queen, of the 29th May, connected her with Bal lard and Mendoza the Spanish ambassador ; and the letters of the 27th July, to Lord Paget, Sir Francis Englefield, Mendoza, the Bishop of Glasgow, and Charles Paget, corroborated not only the confessions of the conspirators, but the contents of the letters be tween her and Babington, and the written testimony of her own secretaries. During this address of the Lord Treasurer, he had occasion to mention the Earl of Arundel, as implicated in some degree with the conspiracy; upon which Mary burst into tears, and lamented, with passionate expressions, the calamities which the noble house of"], [86, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 80 Howard had endured for her sake ; but, soon drying her eyes, and reassuming her dignity and composure, she once more, in reply to the arguments of the Lord Treasurer, asseverated her innocence of any plot against the queen's life. What Babington (she said) might, or might not confess against her, she was ignorant of; neither -was it possible for her to say or discover, whether this written confession was in his handwriting or not. But why had they executed him before they had confronted him with herself, and permitted her to examine him ? If he were now before them, she would have so dealt with him, that the truth would have come out ; but they had taken good care to make this im possible. And the same thing might be said of Nau and Curie ; why was she not confronted with them ? Why was she not permitted to examine them ? They, at least, were alive ; they might have been here if her adversaries had felt confident that they would have corroborated their written confessions. Curie, she was assured, was an honest man, though it was strange to find one in his station adduced as a witness against her. Nau was a more politic and talented person ; he had been secretary to the Cardinal Lorraine, and she had received recommendations in his favour from her brother, the French king ; but she was by no means assured that hope, or fear, or reward, might not' have influenced him to give false evidence against her ; and it was well known that he had Curie at his beck, and could make him write whatever he pleased. It was asserted truly, that her letters were written, and put into cipher, by these secretaries. But what security had she, that they had not inserted into them such things as she had never dictated ? Was it not possible, also, that they might have received letters addressed to her, which they never delivered ; was it not possible"], [87, "1 586. JAMES VI. 81 that they might have answered letters in her name, and in her cipher, which she had never seen ? \" And am I,\" said she, with great animation and dignity ; \"am I, a queen, to be convicted on such evidence as this? Is it not apparent that the majesty and safety of princes falls to the ground, if they are to depend upon the writings and testimony of their secretaries ? I have delivered nothing to them, but what nature dictated to me under the desire of recovering my liberty ; and I claim the privilege of being convicted by nothing but mine own word or writing. If they have written any thing which may be hurtful to the queen, my sister, they have written it altogether with out my knowledge : let them bear the punishment of their inconsiderate boldness. Sure I am, that if they were here present, they would clear me of all blame in this cause : and still more certain am I, that had my papers not been seized, and were I not thus de prived of my notes and letters, I could have more successfully and minutely answered every point which has been so bitterly argued against me.\" 1 In the course of these proceedings (for it would be unjust to call that a trial where the prisoner was de prived of counsel, not permitted access to her papers, and debarred from calling witnesses) Mary made a direct attack on Secretary Walsingham, in speaking of the facility with which her letters and ciphers might be counterfeited. \" What security have I,\" said she, \"that these are my veryT ciphers? a young man, lately in France, has been detected forging my characters. Think you, Mr. Secretary, that I am ignorant of your devices used so craftily against me ? Your spies sur rounded me on every side ; but you know not, perhaps, 1 MS. British Museum, Caligula, ix. sol. 383. Howel's State Trials, vol. i. pp. 1182, 1 183. Also, Camden in Rennet, vol. ii. p. 523. VOL. VII. F"], [88, "1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 82 that some of your spies on me proved false, and brought intelligence to me. And if such have been his doings, my lords,\" she continued, appealing to the assembly, \" how can I be assured that he hath not counterfeited my ciphers to bring me to my death ? Has he not already practised against my life, and that of my son ?\" Upon this, Walsingham, rising in his place, warmly disclaimed the imputation. \" I call God to witness,\" said he, \" that, as a private person, I have done nothing unbeseeming an honest man ; nor, as a public servant of my royal mistress, any thing unworthy of my office ; but I plead guilty to my having been exceeding careful for the safety of the queen, and this realm. I have curiously searched out every practice against both : nor if Ballard, the traitor, had offered me his help in the investigation, would I have refused it.\" With this plausible, but really indirect and evasive disavowal, Mary declared herself satisfied ; and after some argu ments of the lord treasurer, and the crown lawyers, which it is unnecessary to notice, the court adjourned till next morning. The proceedings on the second day were not mate rially different from the first. Mary was still alone, unassisted, and, it maybe added, undismayed ; although at times she gave way to tears, and seemed to feel her desolate condition. She renewed her protestation, declining the jurisdiction of the court ; and demanded that it should be recorded. As to the plot itself of which she was accused, some little variation took place in her mode of defence. On the former day, she had been wholly ignorant of the circumstances which were to be brought against her ; and had commenced her defence by a general denial or disavowal of all treason able correspondence. She was now aware of the evi dence, and partially admitted and defended her letters"], [89, "JAMES VI. 1586. 83 to Morgan, Paget, and Mendoza; she even acknow ledged such notes as, by her secretaries acting under her orders, had been sent to Babington ; 1 but she again most pointedly asserted, that these notes and letters referred solely to the project for her escape. This project, she said, it was perfectly justifiable in her to encourage by every means, even by the invasion of the realm : she then reiterated her denial of being accessary to the conspiracy against the queen's person ; \u2022and entered into a detail of her repeated offers of ac commodation made to that princess. It had been her sincere desire, she affirmed, to remove every ground of dissatisfaction from the mind of her sister ; but her proposals were disallowed, or suspected, or despised ; so that, remaining a captive, she was driven to prac tices for her escape. \" And now,\" said she, \" with what injustice is this cause conducted against me ! my letters are garbled, and wrested from their true meaning : the originals kept from me : no respect shown to the religion which I profess, or the sacred character I bear as a queen. If careless of my personal feelings, think at least, my lords, of the royal majesty which is wounded through me : think of the precedent you are creating. Your own queen was herself accused of a participation in Wyatt's plot ; yet she was innocent ; and Heaven is my witness, that, although a good Catholic, and anxious for the welfare and safety of all who profess that faith, I would shudder to purchase it at the price of blood. The life of the meanest of my people, has been ever dear to me ; and far rather would I plead with Esther, than take the sword with Judith ; though I know the character that has been given me by my enemies, and 1 Egerton, p. 103, Avis de Monsieur BeUievre."], [90, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 84 how they brand me as irreligious.\" She then solemnly appealed to God, and to all foreign princes, against the injustice with which she had been treated. \" I came into England,\" she exclaimed, \" relying on the friendship and promises of the Queen of England. I came, relying on that token which she sent me. Here, my lords,\" she said, drawing a ring from her finger, and showing it to her judges; \"here it is ; regard it well ; it came from your royal mistress ; and trusting to that pledge of love and protection, I came amongst you : 1 you can best tell how that pledge has been redeemed. I desire,\" said she, in conclusion, \" that I may have another day of hearing. I claim the privi lege of having au advocate to plead my cause ; or, being a queen, that I may be believed upon the word of a queen.\" 2 The task of answering this appeal was again under taken by Burghley, who recapitulated the evidence against her; Mary frequently interrupting him by asseverations of her innocence, and a demand for more decided proof. It would now have been the time for the commissioners to deliver their opinions, and to pronounce sentence ; but, to the surprise of many present, the court broke up, having adjourned their meeting to the 25th October, at Westminster. The alleged ground of this abrupt measure, was the infor mality of pronouncing sentence before the record, or official report of the proceedings, was completed : the true cause, was the secret letter of Elizabeth already quoted.3 On the same day on which the court broke up, the 1 Courcelles' Negotiations, p. 18, Bannatyne Club edition. 2 Camden, pp. 524, 525. 3 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. ix. sol. 333 Howel's State Trials, vol. i. p. 1187."], [91, "1586. JAMES VI. 85 high-treasurer repaired to his country seat of Burgh ley, from which he wrote the following letter to Davison. It is valuable, as illustrating the real cha racter of so noted a statesman as Lord Burghley : the approbation with which he speaks of his own elo quence ; the complacent description he gives of his success in counteracting the pity which most generous minds would have felt for Mary's desolate condition ; and the cold sneer with which he styles her the \" Queen of the Castle,\" are all in keeping with his former unfeeling witticism, on the probability of the blow falling between her neck and shoulders. Here is his letter. \" Mr. Secretary, \u2014 Yesternight, upon receipt of your letter, dated on Thursday, I wrote what was thought would be this day's work. The Queen of the Castle was content to appear again afore us in public, to be heard : but, in truth, not to be heard for her defence ; for she would say nothing but negatively, that the points of the letters that concerned the practice against the queen's majesty were never by her written, nor of her knowledge. The rest, for invasion, for escaping by force, she said she will neither deny nor affirm. But her intention was, by long artificial speeches, to move pity ; to lay all blame upon the queen's majesty, or rather on the council, that all the troubles past did ensue ; avowing her reasonable offers and our re fusals. And in this her speeches I did so encounter her with reasons out of my knowledge and experience, as she had not that advantage she looked for ; as I am assured the auditory did find her case not pitoy able, [and] her allegations untrue, by which means great debate fell yesternight very long, and this day renewed with great stomaching. But we had great reason to prorogue our session till the 25th ; and so"], [92, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 86 we of the council will be at court on the 22d ; and we find all persons here in commission fully satisfied, as, by her majesty's order, judgment will be given at our next meeting.\"1 The same day, Walsingham wrote on the same sub ject to Leicester, declaring that even Mary's best friends thought her guilty ; and adding, that but for a secret command of Elizabeth, they would have pronounced sentence. This delay and indecision appears to have so greatly annoyed the secretary, that he represented it as a judgment from heaven, that her majesty had no power to proceed against her as her own safety required.2 On the 25th of October, the commissioners met in the Star-chamber at Westminster, and the same proofs were adduced against the Scottish queen which had been brought forward at Fotheringay ; with the exception that her secretaries, Nau and Curie, were now examined, and corroborated their letters and con fessions.3 The former confessions of these two secre taries had been unsatisfactory to Walsingham and Burghley : 4 they proved the queen to have received letters from Babington, and to have dictated to them certain answers in reply; but judging from the imper fect papers which remain,5 there was no certain proof in their confessions that Mary had dictated the pas sages which implied a knowledge of the conspiracy against Elizabeth's life ; and, on this second occasion at Westminster, they merely corroborated their former 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. ix. sol. 433.

JAMES VI. 87 confessions.1 But Nau, if we may trust his own account, did more ; for he openly asserted that the principal points of accusation against his royal mistress were false ; and, refusing to be silenced by Walsing ham, who attempted to overawe and put him down, he declared that the commissioners wrould have to answer to God and all Christian kings, if, on such false charges, they condemned an innocent princess.2 Into these proceedings against Mary, at West minster, it is unnecessary to enter farther. At Fother ingay we had the accused without the witnesses ; at the Star-chamber we have the witnesses without the accused : for Mary remained at Fotheringay under the morose superintendence of Paulet, whilst the in vestigation proceeded at Westminster, directed by the indefatigable and unrelenting Burghley. Having heard the evidence, the commissioners, as was to be antici pated, pronounced sentence against the queen : declar ing that, since the 1st of June, in the twenty-seventh year of Elizabeth, divers matters had been compassed and imagined within this realm of England, by An thony Babington and others, with the privity of the Queen of Scots, tending to the hurt, death, and de struction of the royal person of her majesty the Queen of England.3 They intimated, at the same time, with the object of conciliating the Scottish king, that nothing in this sentence should affect James's title to the Eng lish crown ; which should remain exactly in the same state as if the proceedings at Fotheringay had never taken place. A few days after this, parliament met ; and after approving and confirming this sentence, unanimously petitioned Elizabeth, as she valued Christ's true reli- 1 Lingard, vol. viii. p. 229. * I*-*id- 3 Ho wel, vol. i. p. 1189."], [94, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 88 gion, the security of the realm, her own life, and the safety of themselves and their posterity, to consent that the sentence against the Queen of Scots should be published. To enforce their request, they called to her remembrance the anger of God against Saul when he spared Agag king of the Amalekites, and his displeasure with Ahab for pardoning Benhadad.1 The answer of Elizabeth was striking, and probably sincere, except in the pity and sorrow it expressed for Mary. She acknowledged, with expressions of deep gratitude to God, her almost miraculous preser vation; and professed the delight she experienced, after a reign of twenty-eight years, to find her sub jects' good will even greater to her now than at its commencement. Her life, she said, had been \" danger- ously shot at ; \" but her sense of danger was lost in sorrow, that one so nearly allied to her as the Queen of Scots, should be guilty of the crime. So far had she herself been from bearing her sister any ill-will, that, upon discovering Mary's treasonable practices, she had written her, that if she would privately con fess them they should be wrapt up in silence ; and now, if the matter had only involved dangers to her self, and not the welfare of her people, she protested that she should willingly pardon Mary. It was only for her people that she, Elizabeth, desired to live ; and if her death could bring them a more flourishing \u00a9 \u00a9 condition, or a better prince, she would gladly lay down her life. After somewhat more in this strain, she informed parliament that their last act had reduced her to great difficulties ; and, in dwelling upon the sorrow felt for Mary, she artfully introduced a circumstance which 1 Camden in Rennet, vol. ii. p. 526."], [95, "1586. JAMES VI. 89 was well calculated to rouse their utmost resentment : telling them that it was but a short while since she had, with her own eyes, seen and read an \" oath, by which some persons had engaged to kill her within a month.\" This was on the 12th November ; and two days after, (14th,) the queen sent the commons a message by her vice-chamberlain, Sir Christopher Hatton, requesting them to consider whether they could not devise some gentler expedient, by which her commiseration for the Scottish queen might be allowed to operate, and her life be spared.1 On the 18th, after much debate, both houses unanimously answered, \" that they could find no other way ; \" and this brief but stern decision was forthwith carried by the lord chancellor and the speaker of the house of commons to the queen, who was then at Richmond. This communication, it was expected, would elicit something direct and definite from Elizabeth ; but the answer which she gave was one of studied ambiguity. \" If,\" said she, addressing the chancellor, \" I should say unto you that I mean not to grant your petition \u2014 by my faith, I should say unto you more than per haps I mean ; and if I should say unto you I mean to grant your petition, I should then tell you more than it is fit for you to know : and so I must deliver you an answer answerless.\" 2 It was now deemed proper that the captive queen should be informed of these proceedings. Since the breaking up of the court at Fotheringay, she had remained there under the custody of Paulet, whose letters to Walsingham breathed a personal dislike 1 MS. letter, Sir George Warrender's MS.

On the 22d November, Lord Buck hurst, and Mr. Beal the clerk of the privy council, arrived at Fotheringay, and communicated to her the sentence of death, which had been pronounced by the commissioners, its ratification by parliament, and the earnest petition of both Houses for her immediate execution. They warned her not to look for mercy ; spoke severely of her attachment to the Catholic faith, which made her life incompatible with the security of the reformed opinions ; and promised her the ministra tions of a Protestant divine in her last hours. The Queen of Scots heard them with the utmost tranquillity, and mildly, but firmly, declined all such religious as sistance. She declared that the judgment of the court was unjust, as she was innocent of all consent to the plot against Elizabeth's life ; but she implored them, in the name of Christ, to permit her to have the spiritual consolations of her almoner, whom she knew to be in the castle, although debarred from her pre sence. For a brief period this was granted : but the indulgence was considered too great, and he was once more removed. Farther and more studied insults were soon offered. On the day after the arrival of Buckhurst, Paulet entered her chamber without cere mony, and informed her that, as she was now no longer to be considered a queen, but a private woman dead in law, the insignia of royalty must be dispensed with. Mary replied, that whatever he or his sovereign might consider her, did not much move her ; she was an anointed princess, and had received this dignity from God : into his hands alone would she resign both it and her soul.1 As for their queen, she as little acknowledged her for her superior, as she did her 1 Martyre de la Royne D'Escosse.

This spirited answer greatly enraged Paulet, who commanded Mary's attendants to take away the \" dais,\" or cloth of state ; and, when they refused, called in some of his own people, who executed the order. He then put on his hat, sat down in her pre sence, and pointing to the billiard-table which stood in the chamber, ordered it to be removed, remarking that these vain recreations no longer became a person in her situation. Such brutal and insolent conduct would have disgraced the commonest jailor in the king dom ; and the man who was guilty of this outrage, could plead no order from Elizabeth.1 That princess now gave orders that the sentence against the Queen of Scots should be proclaimed to the people ; and so highly excited were the citizens in the metropolis with the real or fancied dangers which they had escaped, that the communication was received with every mark of public rejoicing.2 To Mary it brought no new pang, so far as life was concerned ; but she became agitated with the suspicion that Eliza beth, to avoid the odium of a public execution, would endeavour to have her privately assassinated ; and this new idea gave her the utmost inquietude.3 Nor, if we are to believe Camden, 4 were these ideal terrors. Leicester, he affirms, on the first discovery of the con spiracy, had given it as his advice, that Mary should be privately poisoned ; and had even sent a divine to persuade Secretary Walsingham of the lawfulness of such a course, which he, however, utterly rejected and 1 Letter of Mary in Jebb, vol. ii. p. 293.

So horrid an accusation against Leicester would require some decided proof, which the historian has not given ; and it will be afterwards seen that Walsingham's aversion to such a course was exceed ingly short-lived. It was at this time that Mary addressed her last letter to Elizabeth, in these touch- ing and pathetic terms : \u2014 \" Madam \u2014 I bless God with my whole heart, that, by means of your final judgment, he is about to put a period to the wearisome pilgrimage of my life. I make no petition that it should be prolonged, having already but too well known its bitterness : I only now supplicate your highness, that, since I cannot hope for any favour from those exasperated ministers who hold the highest offices in your state, I may obtain, from your own sole bounty, these three favours : \u2014 \" First, As it would be vain for me to expect a burial in England, accompanied by the Catholic rites practised by the ancient monarchs, your ancestors and mine, and since the sepulchres of my fathers have been broken up and violated in Scotland, I earnestly request that, as soon as my enemies shall have glutted themselves with my innocent blood, my body may be carried by my servants to be interred in holy ground : above all, I could wish in France, where rest the ashes of the queen my most honoured mother. Thus shall this poor body, which has never known repose as long as it was united to my soul, have rest at last, when it and my spirit are disunited. \"Secondly, I implore your majesty, owing to the terror I feel for the tyranny of those to whose charge you have abandoned me, let me not be put to death in secret, but in the sight of my servants and others. These persons will be witnesses to my dying in the faith, and in obedience to the true church ; and it will"], [99, "1586. JAMES VI. 93 be their care to rescue the close of my life and the last breathings of my spirit from the calumnies with which they may be assailed by my enemies. \" Thirdly, I request that my servants, who have clung to me so faithfully throughout my many sorrows, may be permitted freely to go where they please, and to retain the little remembrances which my poverty has left them in my will. \" I conjure you, Madam, by the blood of Jesus Christ, by our near relationship, by the memory of Henry the Seventh, our common ancestor, by the title of queen, which I bear even to my death, refuse me not these poor requests, but assure me of your having granted them by a single word under your hand. \" I shall then die, as I have lived, \" Your affectionate Sister and Prisoner, \" Mary the Queen.\" x No answer was ever returned to this pathetic ap peal, nor, indeed, is it absolutely certain that Elizabeth ever received it ; but in the mean time some exertions to save the Scottish queen were made by the French king, and by her son the King of Scotland. Henry the Third had never, during the long course of her misfortunes, exhibited for Mary any feelings of per sonal affection or deep interest, although, from political considerations, he had frequently espoused her cause ; but the idea that a queen and a near relative should be arraigned, condemned, and executed, was so new and appalling, that he deemed it imperative to interfere, and sent Monsieur de Bellievre, his ambassador, to present his remonstrances to the English queen. After many affected delays, Elizabeth received him 1 Jebb, vol. ii. pp. 91, 92."], [100, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586. 94 in unusual state upon her throne, and heard his mes sage with a flashing eye and flushed and angry counte nance.1 She restrained her feelings, however, suffi ciently to make a laboured reply ; pronounced a high encomium upon her own forbearance, promised a speedy and definite answer, protracted the time for more than a month by the most frivolous excuses, and at last drove the ambassador to declare, that if Mary was exe cuted, his master must resent it. The English queen, fired at this threat, demanded whether his master had empowered him to use such language ; and, having found that it was warranted by Bellievre's instructions, wrote a letter of lofty defiance to Henry, and dismissed his envoy. Aubespine the resident ambassador re newed the attempt ; but a pretended plot against the life of Elizabeth, which was said to be traced to some of his suite, furnished a subject for a new and bitter quarrel ; and this, for a time, interrupted all amicable relations between the two ciowns.2 On the side of Scotland, James's efforts were not more successful. This young prince had been early informed of the conspiracy by Walsingham, and had written to Elizabeth congratulating her upon the dis covery.3 The English secretary had employed his friend, the Master of Gray, to sound his royal master as to the intended proceedings against the Queen of Scots ; and bade that nobleman remind the young king, that any mediation for Mary would come with a bad grace from a prince whose father had received such hard measure at her hands.4 To confirm James in these feelings, care had been 1 November 27. 2 Carte, vol. iii. pp. 613, 614. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Master of Gray to Burghley, Sep tember 10, 1586. 4 MS. letter, State-paper Office, original draft by Walsingham, September 17, 1586."], [101, "JAMES VI. 1586. 95 taken to send him an account of the plot, with full extracts from the alleged intercepted correspondence of the Queen of Scots and Babington. In these letters, James must have perceived the severe terms in which he was spoken of by Mary, and become acquainted with her advice given to Lord Claud Hamilton, to seize his person and place him under a temporary restraint. Such revelations were little calculated to foster or preserve any sentiments of affection in a son towards a mother whom he had never known. Yet all this cannot excuse the coldness and indifference which he manifested. Monsieur de Courcelles, who was then in Scotland, received instructions from the French king to incite the young monarch to interfere for Mary : but he replied that his mother was in no danger ; and as for the conspiracy, she must be con tented, he said, to drink the ale she had brewed. He loved her as much as nature and duty bound him ; but he knew well she bore him as little good will as she did the Queen of England : her practices had already nearly cost him his crown ; and he could be well con tent she would meddle with nothing but prayer and serving of God.1 These selfish and moderate sentiments were far from acceptable to the Scottish nobles and people, who felt the treatment offered to the mother of their sovereign, and the superiority assumed by Elizabeth, as a national insult. Angus, Lord Claud Hamilton, Huntley, Bothwell, Herries, and all the leading men about court, protested loudly against her insolence ; and declared their resolution rather to break into open war, than suffer it to proceed to further extre- 1 October 4.

James, it seems, suspected that Elizabeth would send an ambassador to persuade him to remain passive, whatever extremities might be adopted against his mother; and turning to the Earl of Bothwell, a blunt soldier, he asked his advice what he should do. \" If your majesty,\" said he, \" suffers the process to proceed, I think, my liege, you should be hanged yourself the day after.\" George Douglas, also, (the same brave and attached friend of Mary who had assisted in her escape from Lochleven,) remonstrated in strong terms with his royal master ; warning him to beware of giving credit to the lying tales of some about him, who were the pensioned slaves of Elizabeth, and paid to create bad blood between him and his parent. \" And yet,\" answered James, \" how is it possible for me to love her, or to approve her proceedings ? Did she not write to Fontenay, the French ambassador here, that unless I conformed myself to her wishes, I should have nothing but the lordship of Darnley; which was all my father had before me ? Has she not laboured to take the crown off my head, and set up a regent ? Is she not obstinate in holding a dif- ferent religion ? \" \u2014 \" For that matter,\" said Douglas, \" she adheres to her faith, in which she hath been brought up, as your majesty doth to yours : and, looking to the character of your religious guides, she thinks it better that you should come over to her views than she to yours.\" \" Ay, ay,\" said the king, \"truth it is I have been brought up amid a company of mutinous knavish ministers, whose doctrine I could 1 Extract of Courcelles' Negotiations, pp. 11, 13.

JAMES VI. 97 never approve ; but yet I know my religion to be the true one.\" In the mean time, the alarming news from England, and the representations of the French king, convinced James that the question was no longer as to the im prisonment, but the life of Mary ; and the moment he embraced this idea, his whole conduct changed. He wrote a letter of strong and indignant remonstrance \u00a9 O to Elizabeth, and despatched it by Sir William Keith, who was instructed to express himself boldly, and with out reserve, upon the subject. He at the same time, and by the same ambassador, addressed a threatening note to Walsingham, whom he considered his mother's greatest enemy ; and he commanded Keith, on his arrival at the English court, to co-operate with the French ambassador in all his efforts for the safety of the unhappy princess, whose fate seemed to be so fast approaching. He had already written strongly to Archibald Douglas, his ambassador at the English court.1 But it was suspected, on good grounds, that Douglas was wholly in the hands of Elizabeth and Walsingham ; and currently said, that as he had been at the father's murder, he would have his hand as deep in the mother's death.2 On Keith's arrival at the English court,3 Eliza beth and her ministers attempted to frustrate the object of his mission, by the usual weapons of delay and dissimulation. When at last admitted, the queen affected the utmost solicitude for Mary's life ; but 1 Appendix to Robertson's History of Scotland, No. XLIX. Ring James to Archibald Douglas, October 1586.

Lei cester, Burghley, and Walsingham, advised her death. The people, alarmed by reports of the meditated in vasion by Spain, and new plots against their princess, became clamorous on the same subject ; and James, agitated by the ill success of Keith, sent him new in structions, with a private letter written in passionate and threatening terms.3 On communicating it to the English queen, she broke into one of those sudden and tremendous paroxysms of rage, which sometimes shook the council-room, and made the hearts of her ministers quail before her. It was with the greatest difficulty that she was prevented from chasing Keith, who had spoken with great boldness, from her presence. But Leicester her favourite at last appeased her, and on the succeeding day she dictated a more temperate reply to the young king. On his side, also, James re pented of his violence, and, unfortunately for his own 1 Sir George Warrender MSS. B. sol. 341, Archibald Douglas to James, December 8, 1586. 2 MS.

JAMES VI. 99 honour, was induced to adopt a milder tone ; to write an apologetic letter to Elizabeth ; and to despatch the Master of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil with instruc tions, to explain that his \" meaning, in all that had hitherto been done,\" was modest and not menacing.1 Nothing could be more selfish and pusillanimous than such conduct. The Scottish nation and the nobility were loud in their expressions of indignation. Eager to avenge the disgrace inflicted on their country, the nobles had already armed themselves, to break across the border, and take the quarrel into their own hands ; but the king, who had received a private communication from Walsingham,2 was thinking more about his suc cession to the English crown than the peril of his parent : and, intimidated by the violence of Elizabeth, judged it better to conciliate than exasperate. It is difficult to believe that James had any very deep desire to save his mother's life, when he selected so base and unworthy an intercessor as the Master of Gray. The king must have known well that this man had already betrayed her ; that he was a sworn adherent of Elizabeth ; and that Mary's safety, or return to power and influence, brought danger to this envoy himself. So fully were these Gray's feelings, that, in a letter to his friend Archibald Douglas, written as far back as October 11th, he described \"any good to Mary as a staff for their own heads;\" and assured him \" he cared not although she were out of the way.\" 3 The result was exactly what might have been anticipated : Gray, on his arrival at the English court, (29th December,) in his public con- 1 MS. letter, copy, Warrender MSS.

They proposed that Mary should demit her right of succession to the English crown to her son. \" How is that possible ?\" said the queen ; \" she is declared ' inhabil' and can convey nothing.\" \u2014 \" If she have no rights,\" replied Gray, \" your majesty need not fear her ; if she have, let her assign them to her son, in whom will then be placed the full title of succession to your highness.\" \" What !\" said Eliza beth, with a loud voice and great oath, \"get rid of one, and have a worse in her place ? Nay ; then I put myself in a more miserable case than before. By God's Passion, that were to cut mine own throat ; and for a duchy or an earldom to yourself, you, or such as you, would cause some of your desperate knaves to kill me. No, by God ! your master shall never be in that place.\" Gray then craved, that Mary's life might at least be spared for fifteen days, 1 Robertson's Appendix, No. L.

JAMES VI. 101 to give them time to communicate with the king ; but this she peremptorily refused. Melvil implored her to give a respite, were it only for eight days. \" No,\" said Elizabeth, rising up, and impatiently flinging out of the apartment, \" not for an hour.\" x After such a reception, it was impossible not to anticipate the worst ; and although, on a succeeding occasion, the queen appeared somewhat mollified, the ambassadors left her with the conviction, that fears for herself, and not any lingering feelings of mercy towards Mary, were the sole causes of her delay. It was at this time that the Scottish king, having required the ministers of the Kirk to pray for his unhappy mother, then in the toils of her enemies and daily expecting death, received a peremptory refusal. This was the more extraordinary, since James had carefully worded his request so as to remove, as he thought, every possibility of opposition ; but finding himself deceived, he directed Archbishop Adamson to offer up his prayers for the queen, in the High Church of the capital. To his astonishment he found, on entering his seat, that one of the recusant ministers, named Cowper, had preoccupied the pulpit. The king addressed him from the gallery : told him that the place had been intended for another ; but added, that if he would pray for his mother, he might remain where he was. To this, Cowper answered, that he would do as the Spirit of God directed him : a signi ficant reply to all who knew the character of the times, and certainly amounting to a refusal. A scene of con fusion ensued. James commanded Cowper to come down from the pulpit : he resisted. The royal guard sprang forward to pull out the intruder ; and he de- 1 Robertson's Appendix, No. L. Memorial of the Master of Gray, January 12, 1586-7."], [108, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586-7. 102 scended, denouncing woe and wrath on all who held back ; declaring, too, that this hour would rise up in witness against the king, in the great day of the Lord. Adamson then preached on the Christian duty of prayer for all men, with such pathetic eloquence, and so powerfully offered up his intercession for their un fortunate queen, that the congregation separated in tears, lamenting the obstinacy of their pastors.1 Meanwhile, reports were circulated in England, which were artfully calculated to inflame the people and to excuse severity towards Mary. It was said one day, that the Spaniards had landed at Milford Haven, and that the Catholics had joined them ; the next, that Fotheringay castle was attacked, and that the Queen of Scots had made her escape ; then came rumours that the northern counties were already in rebellion, and that a new conspiracy was on foot to slay the queen and set fire to London.2 Amidst these fictitious terrors, the privy council held repeated meetings, and pressed Elizabeth to give her warrant for the execution : Leicester, Burghley, and Walsingham, entreated, argued, and remonstrated ; but she continued distracted and irresolute between the odium which must follow the deed and its neces sity. At last, amid her half sentences and dark hints, they perceived that their mistress wished Mary to be put to death, but had conceived a hope they would spare her the cruelty of commanding it, and find some secret way of despatching her ; she even seemed to think, that if their oath to \"the association\" for her protection did not lead to this, they had promised much, but actually done nothing. From such an in- 1 Spottiswood, p. 334. 2 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 533. Ellis's Letters, 2d Series, vol. iii. pp. 106, 109."], [109, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 103 terpretation of their engagement, however, they all shrunk. The idea of private assassination was ab horrent, no doubt, to their feelings ; but they suspected, also, that Elizabeth's only object was to shift the responsibility of Mary's death from her shoulders to theirs ; and that nothing was more likely than that, the moment they had fulfilled her wishes, she should turn round and accuse them of acting without orders. Meanwhile, she became hourly more unquiet, forsook her wonted amusements, courted solitude, and often was heard muttering to herself a Latin sentence taken from some of those books of Emblemata, or Aphorisms, which were the fashion of the day: Autfer, aut fieri; ne feriare, fieri. i This continued till the 1st of February, when the queen sent for Mr. Davison the secretary, at ten in the morning. On arriving at the palace, he found that the Lord Admiral Howard had been conversing with Elizabeth on the old point \u2014 the Scottish queen's execution ; and had received orders to send Secretary Davison to her with the warrant, which had already been drawn up by Burghley the lord treasurer,2 and lay in his possession unsigned. Davison hasted to his chamber, and coming instantly back with it and some other papers in his hand, was called in by Elizabeth, who, aftersometalk on indifferent topics, asked him what papers he had with him. He replied, divers warrants for her signature. She then inquired whether he had seen the lord admiral, and had brought the warrant for the Scottish queen's execution. He declared he had, and delivered it into the queen's hand ; upon which she read it over, called 1 Either strike or he stricken ; strike lest thou be stricken.

To this bantering question he replied gravely, that he preferred tlie death of the guilty before that of the innocent, and could not be sorry that her majesty took the only course to protect her person from imminent danger. Elizabeth then commanded him to take the warrant to the chancellor and have it sealed, with her orders that it should be used as secretly as possible ; \" and by the way,\" said she, relapsing again into her jocular tone, \" you may call on Walsingham and show it him : I fear the shock will kill him outright.\" She added, that a public execution must be avoided. It should life done, she said, not in the open green or court of the castle, but in the hall. In conclusion, she forbade him absolutely to trouble her any farther, or let her hear any more till it was done ; she, for her part, having performed all that in law or reason could be required.1 The secretary now gathered up his papers, and was taking his leave, when Elizabeth stayed him for a short space, and complained of Paulet and others, who might have eased her of this burden. \" Even now,\" said she, \" it might be so done, that the blame might be removed from myself. Would you and Walsingham write jointly, and sound Sir Amias and Sir Drew Drury upon it?\" To this Davison consented, promis ing to let Sir Amias know what she expected at his hands ; and the queen, having again repeated, in an earnest tone, that the matter must be closely handled, dismissed him.2 1 Davison's Defence, drawn up by himself, in Caligula, C. ix. sol. 470, printed by Nicolas.

In the afternoon of that day, Davison visited Walsingham, showed him the warrant with Elizabeth's signature, consulted with him on the horrid communication to be made to Paulet and Drury, and repairing to the chancellor, had the great seal affixed to the warrant. The fatal paper was then left in the hands of that dignitary ; and Walsingham and Davison the same evening wrote and despatched a letter to Fotheringay, recommending to her keepers the secret assassination of their royal charge, at the queen their mistress's special request. This letter, taken from an original found amongst Paulet's own papers,1 was in these calm and measured terms: \u2014 \" To Sir Amias Paulet. \" After our hearty commendations. We find by speech lately uttered by her majesty, that she doth note in you both a lack of that care and zeal for her service that she looketh for at your hands ; in that you have not in all this time, of yourselves, (without other provocation,) found out some way to shorten the life of that queen ; considering the great peril she is subject unto hourly, so long as the said queen shall live. Wherein, besides a lack of love towards her, she noteth greatly, that you have not that care of your own particular safeties, or rather of the preserva tion of religion, and the public good and prosperity of your country, that reason and policy commandeth ; especially, having so good a warrant and ground for the satisfaction of your consciences towards God, and the discharge of your credit and reputation towards the world, as the oath of \" association,\" which you 1 Life of Davison, p. 85.

And so we commit you to the pro tection of the Almighty.

Cruel and morose, however, as Paulet had undoubtedly been to Mary, he was not the common murderer which Elizabeth took him to be; and refused peremptorily to have any hand in her horrid purpose.

My good livings and life are at her majesty's disposition, and I am ready to lose them this next morrow, if it shall so please her : acknow ledging that I hold them as of her mere and gracious favour. I do not desire them to enjoy them but with her highness's good liking ; but God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwrack of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, to shed blood without law and warrant.

He said he had ; and she asked sharply why he had made such haste. \" I obeyed your majesty's commands,\" was his reply, \" and deemed it no matter to be dallied -with.\" \u2014 \" True,\" said she ; \" yet methinks the best and safest way would be to have it otherwise handled.\" He answered to this, that, if it was to be done at all, 1 Hearne's Robert of Gloucester, vol. ii. p. 675."], [114, "1586-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 108 the honourable way was the safest -,1 and the queen dismissed him. But by this time the warrant, with the royal signature, was in the hands of the council ; and on that day they addressed a letter, enclosing it, to the Earl of Shrewsbury. This letter was signed by Burghley the lord treasurer, Leicester, Hunsdon, Knollys, Walsingham, Derby, Howard, Cobham, Sir Christopher Hatton, and Davison himself.2 Yet some fears as to the responsibility of sending it away with out the queen's knowledge, made them still hesitate to despatch it. In this interval, Paulet's answer arrived ; and as Walsingham, to whom he had ad dressed it, was sick, (or, as some said, pretended illness,) the task of communicating it to Elizabeth fell on Davison. She read it with symptoms of great impatience ; and breaking out into passionate ex pressions, declared that she hated those dainty, nice, precise fellows, who promised much, but performed nothing, casting all the burden on her. But, she added, she would have it done without him, by Wingfield. Who this new assassin was, to whom the queen alluded, does not appear.3 The privy council, meanwhile, had determined to take the responsibility of sending off the warrant for the execution upon themselves ; and for this purpose intrusted it to Beal, the clerk of the council, who, on the evening of Saturday the 4th of February, arrived with it at the seat of the Earl of Kent, and next day, being Sunday, proceeded to Fotheringay, and commu nicated it to Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drew Drury.4 Intelligence was then sent to the Earl of Shrewsbury, 1 Davison's Apology, in Nicolas's Life, Appendix A. 8 Ellis's Letters, 2d series, vol. iii. pp. Ill, 112. 3 Davison's Defence ; Nicolas's Life of Davison, p. 103 ; and id.

For some days before this, Mary's servants had suspected the worst; but the preparations which now took place, and the arrival of so many strangers, threw them into despair. On Tuesday, after dinner at two o'clock, the two earls demanded an audience of the Queen of Scots, who sent word that she was indisposed and in bed ; but if the matter were of consequence, she would rise and receive them. On their reply that it could brook no delay, they were admitted after a short interval ; and Kent and Shrewsbury coming into the apartment, with Paulet, Drury, and Beal, found her seated at the bottom of her bed, her usual place, with her small work-table before her.1 Near her stood her physician Burgoin, and her women. When the earls uncovered, she received them with her usual tranquil grace ; and Shrewsbury, in few words, informed her that his royal mistress, Elizabeth, being overcome by the importunity of her subjects, had given orders for her execution, for which she would now be pleased to hear the warrant. Beal then read the commis sion, to which she listened unmoved, and without interrupting him. On its conclusion she bowed her head, and, making the sign of the cross, thanked her gracious God that this welcome news had at last come ; declaring how happy she should be to leave a world where she was of no use, and had suffered such continued affliction. She assured the lords that she regarded it as a signal happiness, that 1 La Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, Jebb, vol. ii. p. 612."], [116, "1586-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 110 God had sent her death at this moment, after so many evils and sorrows endured for his Holy Catholic church : \" That church,\" she continued, with great fervour of expression, \"for which I have been ready, as I have often testified, to lay down my life, and to shed my blood drop by drop. Alas !\" she continued, \" I did not think myself worthy of so happy a death as this ; but I acknowledge it as a sign of the love of God, and humbly receive it as an earnest of my reception into the number of his servants. Long have I doubted and speculated, for these eighteen or nineteen years, from day to day, upon all that was about to happen to me. Often have I thought on the manner in which the English have acted to imprisoned princes ; and after my frequent escapes from such snares as have been laid for me, I have scarce ventured to hope for such a blessed end as this.\" She then spoke of her high rank, which had so little defended her from cruelty and injustice : born a queen, the daughter of a king, the near relative of the Queen of England, the granddaughter of Henry the Seventh, once Queen of France, and still queen-dowager of that kingdom ; and yet, what had all this availed her ? She had loved England ; she had desired its prosperity, as the next heir to that crown ; and, as far as was permitted to a good Catholic, had laboured for its welfare. She had earnestly longed for the love and friendship of her good sister the queen ; had often informed her of coming dangers; had cherished, as the dearest wish of her heart, that for once she should meet her in person, and speak with her in confidence ; being well assured that, had this ever happened, there would have been an end of all jealousies and dissensions. But all had been refused her; her enemies, who still"], [117, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 111 lived and acted for their own interests, had kept them asunder. She had been treated with ignominy and injustice; imprisoned, contrary to all faith and treaties ; kept a captive for nineteen years ; \" and at last,\" said she, laying her hand upon the New Testa ment which was on her table, \"condemned by a tribunal which had no power over me, for a crime of which I here solemnly declare I am innocent.1 I have neither invented, nor consented to, nor pursued any conspiracy for the death of the Queen of Eng land.\" The Earl of Kent here hastily interrupted her, declaring that the translation of the Scriptures on which she had sworn was false, and the Roman Catholic version, which invalidated her oath. \" It is the translation in which I believe,\" answered Mary, \"as the version of our holy church. Does your lord ship think my oath would be better if I swore on your translation, which I disbelieve?\" She then entreated to be allowed the services of her priest and almoner, who was in the castle, but had not been permitted to see her since her removal from Chartley. He would assist her, she said, in her pre parations for death, and administer that spiritual consolation, which it would be sinful to receive from any one of a different faith. To the disgrace of the noblemen, the request was refused : nor was this to be attributed to any cruelty in Elizabeth, who had given no instructions upon the subject ; but to the intolerant bigotry of the Earl of Kent, who, in a long theological discourse, attempted to convert her to his own opinions, offering her, in the place of her confessor, the services of the Protestant Dean of Peterborough, Dr. Fletcher, whom they had brought with them. Mary expressed her astonishment at this last unexpected stroke of 1 La Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, p. 618."], [118, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586-7* 112 cruelty ; but bore it meekly as she had done all the rest, although she peremptorily declined all assistance from the dean. She then inquired what time she should die; and the earls having answered, \"To-morrow at eight in the morning,\" made their obeisance, and left the room. On their departure she called her women, and bade them hasten supper, that she might have time to arrange her affairs. Nothing could be more natural, or rather playful, than her manner at this moment. \" Come, come,\" said she, \"Jane Ken nedy, cease weeping, and be busy. Did I not warn you, my children, that it would come to this? and now, blessed be God ! it has come ; and fear and sorrow are at an end. Weep not, then, nor lament, but re joice rather that you see your poor mistress so near the end of all her troubles. Dry your eyes, then, and let us pray together.\" Her men-servants, who were in tears, then left the room, and Mary passed some time in devotion wTith her ladies : after which she occupied herself in counting the money which still remained in her cabinet ; divid ing it into separate sums, which she intended for her servants ; and then putting each sum into a little purse with a slip of paper, on which she wrote, with her own hand, the name of the person for whom it was destined. Supper was next brought in, of which she partook sparingly, as was usual with her ; conversing from time to time with Burgoin her physician, who served her ; and sometimes falling into a reverie, during which it was remarked that a sweet smile, as if she had heard some good news, would pass over her features, lighting them up with an expression of animated joy, which, much changed as she was by sorrow and ill health, recalled to her poor servants her days of beauty. It was with one of these looks that, turning to her"], [119, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 113 physician, she said, \" Did you remark, Burgoin, what that Earl of Kent said in his talk with me : that my life would have been the death, as my death would be the life of their religion ? Oh, how glad am I at that speech ! Here comes the truth at last, and I pray you remark it. They told me I was to die, because I had plotted against the queen ; but then arrives this Kent, whom they sent hither to convert me, and what says he ? I am to die for my religion.\" x After supper, she called for her ladies, and asking for a cup of wine, drank to them all, begging them to pledge her ; which they did on their knees, mingling their tears in the cup, and asking her forgiveness if they had ever offended her. This she readily gave them, bidding them farewell with much tenderness, entreating in her turn their pardon, and solemnly enjoining them to continue firm in their religion, and forget all their little jealousies, living in peace and love with each other. It would be easier to do so now, she added, since Nau, who had been so busy in creating dissensions, was no longer with them. This was the only subject on which she felt and expressed herself with something like keenness ; repeating more than once, that he was the cause of her death, but adding that she forgave him. She next examined her wardrobe, and selected various dresses as presents to her servants, delivering them at the moment, with some kind expression to each. She then wrote to her almoner, lamenting that the cruelty of her enemies had refused her the consolation of his presence with her in her last moments, imploring him to watch and pray with her that night, and to send her his absolu- 1 Camden iu Kennet, vol. ii. p. 534.

By this time it was two in the morning, and finding herself fatigued, she lay down, having first washed her feet, whilst her women watched and read at her bedside. They observed that, though quite still and tranquil, she was not asleep, her lips moving, as if engaged in secret prayer. It was her custom to have her women read to her at night a portion of the \" Lives of the Saints,\" a book she loved much ; and this last night she would not omit it, but made Jane Kennedy choose a portion, for their usual devotions. She selected the life entitled, \" The Good Thief,\" which treats of that beautiful and affecting example of dying faith and divine compassion. \" Alas ! \" said Mary, \" he was indeed a very great sinner, but not so great as I am. May my Saviour, in memory of His Passion, have mercy on me, as He had on him at the hour of death.\" 2 At this moment she recollected that she would require a handkerchief to bind her eyes at her execution ; and bidding them bring her several, she selected one of the finest, which was embroidered with gold, laying it carefully aside. Early in the morning she rose, observing that now she had but two hours to live ; and having finished her toilet she came into her oratory, and kneeling with her women before the altar, where they usually said mass, continued long in prayer. Her physician then, afraid of her being exhausted, begged her to take a little bread and wine ; which she did cheerfully, thanking him at the same time for giving her her last meal. A knock was now heard at the door, and a messen- 1 The letters are preserved, and will be found printed in Jebb, vol. ii. pp. 627, 630. a Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, Jebb, vol. ii. p. 631."], [121, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 115 ger came to say that the lords waited for her. She begged to be allowed a short time to conclude her devotions. Soon after, a second summons arriving, the door was opened, and the sheriff alone, with his white wand, walked into the room, proceeded to the altar, where the queen still knelt, and informed her that all was ready. She then rose, saying simply, \" Let us go ;\" and Burgoin her physician, who assisted her to rise from her knees, asking her at this moment whether she would not wish to take with her the little cross and ivory crucifix which lay on the altar, she said : \" Oh yes, yes ! it was my intention to have done so : many, many thanks for putting me in mind !\" She then received it, kissed it, and desired Annibal, one of her suite, to carry it before her. The sheriff, walking first, now conducted her to the door of the apartment ; on reaching which, her servants, who had followed her thus far, were informed that they must now turn back, as a command had been given that they should not accompany their mistress to the scaffold. This stern and unnecessary order was re ceived by them with loud remonstrances and tears ; but Mary only observed, that it was hard not to suffer her poor servants to be present at her death. She then took the crucifix in her hand, and bade them affectionately adieu ; whilst they clung in tears to her robe, kissed her hand, and were with difficulty torn from her, and locked up in the apartment. The queen after this proceeded alone down the great staircase, at the foot of which she was received by the Earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were struck with the perfect tranquillity and unaffected grace with which she met them. She was dressed in black satin, matronly, but richly, and with more studied care than she was commonly accustomed to bestow. She wore a long"], [122, "116 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586-7. veil of white crape, and her usual high Italian ruff; an Agnus Dei was suspended by a pomander chain round her neck, and her beads of gold hung at her girdle.1 At the bottom of the staircase she found Sir Andrew Melvil, her old affectionate servant, and master of her household, waiting to take his last fare well. On seeing her he flung himself on his knees at her feet, and bitterly lamented it should have fallen on him to carry to Scotland the heart-rending news of his dear mistress's death. \" Weep not, my good Melvil,\" said she, \" hut rather rejoice that an end has at last come to the sorrows of Mary Stuart. And carry this news with thee, that I die firm in my re ligion, true to Scotland, true to France. May God, who can alone judge the thoughts and actions of men, forgive those who have thirsted for my blood ! He knows my heart ; He knows my desire hath ever been, that Scotland and England should be united. Remember me to my son,\" she added. \" Tell him I have done nothing that may prejudice his kingdom of Scotland. And now, good Melvil, my most faithful servant, once more I bid thee farewell.\" She then earnestly entreated that her women might still be permitted to be with her at her death ; but the Earl of Kent peremptorily refused, alleging that they would only disturb every thing by their lamentations, and be guilty of something scandalous and supersti tious; probably dipping their handkerchiefs in her blood. \" Alas, poor souls ! \" said Mary, \" I will give my word and promise they will do none of these things. It would do them good to bid me farewell ; and I hope your mistress, who is a maiden queen, hath not given you so strait a commission. She 1 See Froofs and Illustrations, No. II."], [123, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 117 might grant me more than this, were I a far meaner person. And yet, my lords, you know I am cousin to your queen, descended from the blood of Henry the Seventh, a married Queen of France, and an anointed Queen of Scotland. Surely, surely they will not deny me this last little request: my poor girls wish only to see me die.\" J As she said this, a few tears were observed to fall, for the first time ; and after some consultation, she was permitted to have two of her ladies and four of her gentlemen beside her. She then immediately chose Burgoin her physician, her almoner, surgeon, and apothecary, with Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curie. Followed by them, and by Melvil bearing her train, she entered the great hall, and walked to the scaffold, which had been erected at its upper end. It was a raised platform, about two feet in height, and twelve broad, surrounded by a rail, and covered with black. Upon it were placed a low chair and cushion, two other seats, and the block. The queen regarded it without the least change of countenance, cheerfully mounted the steps, and sat down with the same easy grace and dignity with which she would have occupied her throne. On her right were seated the Earls of Kent and Shrews- bury, on her left stood the sheriffs, and before her the two executioners. The Earl of Kent, the Dean of Peterborough, Sir Amias Paulet, Sir Drew Drury, Beal the clerk of the privy-council, and others, stood beside the scaffold ; and these, with the guards, officers, attendants, and some of the neighbouring gentry, who had been permitted to be present, made up an assembly of about two hundred in all. Beal then read the warrant for her death, which she heard with apparent attention ; but those near her could see, 1 La Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, Jebb, vol. ii. pp. 635, 636,"], [124, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586-7. 118 by the sweet and absent expression of her counte nance, that her thoughts were far off. When it was finished, she crossed herself, and ad dressed a few words to the persons round the scaffold. She spoke of her rights as a sovereign princess, which had been invaded and trampled on, and of her long sorrows and imprisonment ; but expressed the deepest thankfulness to God, that, being now about to die for her religion, she was permitted, before this company, to testify that she died a Catholic, and innocent of having invented any plot, or consented to any prac tices against the queen's life. \" I will here,\" said she, \" in my last moments accuse no one ; but when I am gone, much will be discovered that is now hid, and the objects of those who have procured my death be more clearly disclosed to the world.\" Fletcher the Dean of Peterborough now came up upon the scaffold, and, with the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury, made an ineffectual attempt to engage Mary in their devotions; but she repelled all their offers, at first mildly, and afterwards, when they in sisted on her joining with them in prayer, in more peremptory terms. It was at this moment that Kent, in the excess of his Puritanism, observing her in tensely regarding the crucifix, bade her renounce such antiquated superstitions : \" Madam,\" said he, \" that image of Christ serves to little purpose, if you have him not engraved upon your heart.\" \u2014 \" Ah,\" said Mary, \"there is nothing more becoming a dying Christian than to carry in his hands this remem brance of his redemption. How impossible is it to have such an object in our hands and keep the heart unmoved ! \"* 1 Martyre de Marie Stuart, Royne D'Escosse.

JAMES VI. 119 The Dean of Peterborough then prayed in English, being joined by the noblemen and gentlemen who were present ; whilst Mary, kneeling apart, repeated portions of the Penitential Psalms in Latin,1* and afterwards continued her prayers aloud in English. By this time, the dean having concluded, there was a deep silence, so that every word was heard. Amid this stilness she recommended to God his afflicted church, her son the King of Scotland, and Queen Elizabeth. She declared that her whole hope rested on her Saviour ; and although she confessed that she was a great sinner, she humbly trusted that the blood of that immaculate Lamb, which had been shed for all sinners, would wash all her guilt away. She then invoked the blessed Virgin and all the saints, implor ing them to grant her their prayers with God ; and finally declared that she forgave all her enemies. It was impossible for any one to behold her at this mo ment without being deeply affected : on her knees, her hands clasped together and raised to Heaven, an expression of adoration and divine serenity lighting up her features, and upon her lips the words of for giveness to her persecutors. As she finished her devotions she kissed the crucifix, and making the sign of the cross, exclaimed, in a clear, sweet voice, \" As thine arms, 0 my God, were spread out upon the cross, so receive me within the arms of thy mercy : extend thy pity, and forgive my sins ! \" She then cheerfully suffered herself to be undressed by her two women, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curie, and gently admonished them not to distress her by 1 The psalms, as numbered in the reformed version, were xxxi.

On seeing the executioner come up to offer his assistance, she smiled, and playfully said, she had neither been used to such grooms of the chamber, nor to undress before so many people. When all was ready she kissed her two wTomen, and, giving them her last blessing, desired them to leave her, one of them having first bound her eyes with the handker chief which she had chosen for the purpose. She then sat down, and, clasping her hands together, held her neck firm and erect, expecting that she was to be beheaded in the French fashion, with a sword, and in a sitting attitude. Those who were present, and knew nothing of this misconception, wondered at this ; and in the pause, Mary, still waiting for the blow, repeated the psalm, \" In thee, 0 Lord, have I trusted : let me never be put to confusion.\" 1 On being made aware of her mistake she instantly knelt down, and, groping with her hands for the block, laid her neck upon it without the slightest mark of trembling or hesitation. Her last words were, \" Into thy hands I commend my spirit, for thou hast redeemed me, 0 Lord God of truth.\" At this moment the tears and emotions of the spectators had reached their height, and appear, unfortunately, to have shaken the nerves and disturbed the aim of the executioner, so that his first blow was ill directed, and only wounded his victim. She lay, however, perfectly still, and the next stroke severed the head from the body. The executioner then held the head up and called aloud, \" God save the queen ! \" \" So let all Queen Elizabeth's enemies perish ! \" was the prayer of the Dean of Peterborough; but the In te, Domine, cnnfido : non confundar in \u00e6temum."], [127, "1586-7.

On removing the dead body, and the clothes and mantle which lay beside it, Mary's favourite little dog, which had fol lowed its mistress to the scaffold unperceived, was found nestling under them. No entreaty could prevail on it to quit the spot ; and it remained lying beside the corpse, and stained in the blood, till forcibly carried away by the attendants.2 1 Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, p. 641.

After having signed the warrant for her execution, commanded it to be carried to the Seals, aud positively interdicted Davison, to whom she de livered it, from any further communication with her till it was obeyed, she suddenly turned fiercely round upon him and her council, and cast on them the whole guilt of Mary's blood. In a moment she denied, or pretended to forget, every thing which she had done. She had declared to Sir Robert Melvil, that she would not spare his royal mistress's life for one hour ; now she swore vehemently that she never intended to take it. She had assured Davison, with a great oath, that she meant the execution to go forward ; now she loudly protested that she had commanded him to keep the warrant till he received further orders. She had laboured anxiously with Paulet to have Mary secretly made away with ; and now she did not scruple to call God to witness, under awful obtestations, that her"], [129, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 123 determined resolution had been all along to save her life.1 And her subsequent conduct was perfectly in character with all this. On the day after the execu tion, Lord Shrewsbury wrote from Fotheringay to the court, which was then at Greenwich. Next morning, at nine, his letters were brought to the palace by his son Henry Talbot, and the news became public. Soon after, the bells of the city, and the blazing of bonfires, proclaimed the happiness of the people.2 It was im possible that these demonstrations should have escaped the notice of Elizabeth ; and we know from Davison, every word of whose \" Apology \" carries truth and conviction with it, that the queen that same night was made aware of Mary's execution ; 3 but she took no notice, and kept an obstinate silence. Apparently none of her ministers dared to allude to the event ; and when, after four days, the news was at last forced upon her, she broke into a hypocritical passion of astonishment, tears, and indignation. She upbraided her councillors with having purposely deceived her,4 chased Burghley from her presence, and committed Secretary Davison to the Tower. It was in vain that this upright and able, but most unfortunate of men pleaded, with all the energy of truth, the commands of his sovereign for every thing that he had done. She knew he had no witnesses of their conversation ; charged him with falsehood and disobedience ; com pelled Burghley, who must have been well assured of 1 Supra, pp. 100, 101.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 124 his innocence, to draw up a severe memorial against him ; had him tried before the Star-chamber ; degraded him from his office of secretary ; inflicted on him a fine which amounted to absolute ruin ; and never after wards admitted him to the least enjoyment of her favour.1 All this was in keeping with the subtlety and disregard of truth which sometimes marked Eliza beth's proceedings, when she had any great object to gain. It was part of a premeditated plan by which she hoped to mislead Europe, and convince its states that she was really guiltless of Mary's blood : but ultimately it had no effect on the continent ; and it was too palpably fictitious to be successful for a moment in Scotland, where the facts were well known. In that country, the news of Mary's execu tion was received with a universal burst of indigna tion, and open threats of revenge. But the English wardens, Lord Scrope and Sir John Foster, were provided against immediate attack ; and the season of the year, which was seed-time, rendered it difficult for the Scots to assemble in any force.2 It was Mr. Roger Ashton, a gentleman of James's bed-chamber, whom he had sent to London some time before this, that brought the king the first certain intelligence of his mother's death. Ashton arrived in Edinburgh about the 7th day after the execution ; and Lord Scrope, who had despatched a spy to watch James's motions, wrote in alarm to Walsingham, that the monarch was grievously offended, and had sworn that so foul an act of tyranny and injustice should 1 Nicolas's Life of Davison, pp. 82, 83 ; and Appendix, pp. 235, 236, 260, 263. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

JAMES VI. 125 not pass unrevenged.1 The feelings, however, of this prince were neither deep nor lasting. Even at this sad moment, selfishness and the assurance of undivided sovereignty neutralized his resentment ; and he suf fered some expressions of satisfaction to escape him, which his chief minister, Secretary Maitland, did not choose should reach any but the most confidential ears.2 Meantime, as Ashton's information was secret, James took no public notice of it, but sent in haste for Lord Maxwell, Kerr of Ancrum, and young Ferny hirst.3 These were reckoned amongst his most war like border leaders ; and whilst the country rang with threats of revenge, the king shut himself up in his palace, and held conference with them and his most confidential nobles. Amid these consultations, Mr. Robert Carey was despatched by the English queen to convey her apology to Scotland. This young courtier was the son of Lord Hunsdon, Elizabeth's cousin-german, and she selected him as a personal favourite of the Scot tish king. He carried with him a letter, written in her own hand, in which she expressed the excessive grief which overwhelmed her mind, in consequence of what she termed \" the miserable accident which had befallen, far contrary to her meaning;\"4 and he was instructed to throw the entire blame of the tragedy at Fotheringay upon Davison and her council. On arriving at Berwick, Carey forwarded a letter request- 1 Lord Scrope to Walsingham. Queen Elizabeth and her Times, vol. ii. p. 333, 21st February, 1586-7. Also, State-paper Office, B.C. Sir H.

He added, however, that he would send some members of his council to Berwick, to whom the letter and mes sage of the English queen might be delivered. On any other occasion the wrath of Elizabeth would have blazed high and fierce at such an indignity ; but at this moment she was placed in circumstances which compelled her to digest the affront ; and Carey com municated her false and ungenerous version of the story of Mary's death to Sir Robert Melvil and the Laird of Cowdenknowes, who met him for this pur pose at Berwick.1 All this failed, as may readily be believed, to convince James, or appease the general indignation of the people. By this time, the execution of the Scottish queen, with its affecting details, was known throughout the country; and whatever may have been the king's secret resolutions upon the subject, he felt that it would be almost impossible to resist the deep and increasing current of popular fury which was sweeping on to its revenge. Many symptoms daily occurred to show this : al ready the Scottish border chiefs had so strictly way laid every road and pass, that not a letter or scrap of intelligence could be conveyed to the English court ; three Scottish scouts, with troopers trained to the duty, and armed to the teeth, were stationed at Lin ton Bridge, Coldingham Moor, and beyond Hadding- 1 Warrender MSS. vol.

JAMES VI. 127 ton, who watched day and night, and pounced on every packet. The system of secret intelligence was at a stand ; Walsingham pined for news, and complained that his \" little blue-cap lads,\" who used to bring him word of all occurrences, were no more the men he had known them. Although the season of the year was unfavourable, the borders were already stirring ; some minor Scottish forays took place ; and Both well, whose power was almost kingly on the marches, intimated unequivocally, that he only delayed his blow that it might fall the more heavily. He refused to put on mourning, striking his mailed glove on his breast, and declaring that the best \" dule weed\" for such a time, was a steel coat. Nor did he stand alone in these sentiments. Lord Claud Hamilton, and his brother Arbroath, offered, on the moment, to raise three thou sand men, and carry fire and sword to the gates of Newcastle ; whilst Buccleuch, Cessford, and Ferny hirst, were only restrained from an outbreak by the positive injunctions of the king, and stood full armed, and fiery-eyed, straining like blood-hounds in the slip, ready to be let loose on a moment's warning against England. The first circumstance which offered any perceptible check to these dread appearances, was the arrival of an able letter addressed by Walsingham to Sir John Maitland of Thirlstane, the Scottish secretary of state, which was evidently meant for the king's eye. Thirlstane, originally bred to the law, was then high in his master's favour, and had risen by his talents as a statesman to be his most confidential minister. He was the son of Sir Richard Maitland, and younger brother of the Secretary Lethington; and although his powers were less brilliant and commanding than those wielded by that extraordinary man, his good"], [134, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1586-7. 128 sense, indefatigable application to business, and per- sonal intrepidity, made him a valuable servant to his sovereign, and a formidable antagonist to the higher nobility, who envied and disliked him. To him, there- fore, Walsingham wisely addressed this letter, or rather memorial, in which he argued the question of peace or war, and pointed out the extreme folly and impolicy of those counsels which, at such a moment, urged the young king to a rupture with England. His reasons were well calculated to make an impression upon James.1 Adverting to the injustice of the quarrel, he described, with great force of argument, the effects that a war with England must inevitably produce on his title to the succession after the queen's death, and the certain alienation of the whole body of the English nobility and people from a prince who first revived the ancient and almost forgotten enmity between the two nations, and then hoped to be welcomed as the suc- cessor of so great and popular a princess as Elizabeth. As for Spain and France, on whose assistance it was reported he chiefly depended, could he for a moment imagine that Spain would prove true to him ? \u2014 a country which hated him for his religion ; or France, whose policy was to counteract, by every possible method, an event which must be so fatal to her power, as the union, whether by conquest or otherwise, of the crowns of England and Scotland? Could he believe that the French monarch would assist him to a con- quest which, if completed, must threaten his own crown? Had he forgotten that the monarchs of England still insisted on their right to the throne of France ? Besides, could it be credited for an instant, that the king of that country would ever cordially 1 His letter, which is very long, is printed entire by Suottiswood. pp. 359, 360,361,362."], [135, "1587. JAMES VI. 129 unite his interests with a monarch so nearly allied as James to the family of Guise; a house which Henry hated in his heart, and which he suspected to aim at his deposition ? There can be no doubt that these arguments of so far-sighted a statesman as Walsingham, were not thrown away eventually upon James ; but at the moment the impression was scarcely perceptible, and for some time every thing portended war. The Scottish borders, which during the winter and spring had been kept in tolerable quietness, broke into open hostility as the summer advanced. Six suc cessive Scottish forays swept with relentless havock through the middle marches ; and Sir Cuthbert Col lingwood, who commanded in those parts, found him self too weak to restrain the incursions of the fierce marauders of Cessford, Fernyhirst, Bothwell, and Angus. In a piteous letter to Walsingham, he described the country as having been reduced to a desert, wasted with fire and sword, and filled with lamentation and dismay;1 and he remonstrated with the Scottish wardens in strong terms. But so little impression did Collingwood's complaints make on the Scottish government, and so inadequate was the assis tance sent him by his own, that Buccleuch, Cessford, and Johnston, with a force of two thousand men, attacked him in his castle at Eslington, slew seven teen of his garrison, took one of his sons prisoner, severely wounded another, and but for the fleetness of his horse, had made captive the warden himself. It seems difficult to reconcile these flagrant outrages, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Collingwood to Walsingham, 12th July, 1587. Ibid. B.C. same to same, 21st May, 1587. Ibid.

The probable explanation may be, that the young King of Scots, without serious intentions of war, was not dis pleased that Elizabeth should have a little temporary experience of his power of disturbing her ; that he was not annoyed by such excesses ; and even, as Foster asserted and Burghley suspected, secretly encouraged them.1 He knew that Elizabeth was anxious to con ciliate him, and had determined, at all hazards, to purchase peace with Scotland; and he, on his side, had resolved that he would not sell it too cheap. He was well aware of the embarrassments with which the English queen was now surrounded. The mighty preparations of Spain against England wTere no secret ; the rebellion of Tyrone in Ireland was at its height ; in Scotland the Catholic lords, Huntley, Errol, Angus, Maxwell, and their adherents, were powerful, warlike, and stirring, animated with the bitterest animosity against Elizabeth, whom they detested as the mur deress of their queen and the implacable enemy of their religion. Another thorn in the side of England was the constant friendly intercourse between the Irish insurgents and the Scottish isles. From these nurseries of warlike seamen and soldiers, strong rein forcements had already joined Tyrone ; and the chiefs, who were as fierce and potent as so many little sea kings, drove a lucrative trade by serving him against England at a high price. This was another weapon in the hand of James. By means of his lieutenants, Huntley and Argyle, to whom the administration of 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

JAMES VI. 131 the northern parts of his dominions was intrusted, he could let loose the Islesmen against Elizabeth, or detain them at home, as suited his policy ; and that queen repeatedly requested him to exert this influence in her favour. To do this, however, with greater profit to himself, the king was not unwilling she should feel his power ; and, with this view, he shut his eyes to the border inroads, delayed remonstrating with Huntley on his intrigues with Spain, refused to appre hend the Jesuits who were lurking in his dominions, and gave himself no trouble to check the rising ani mosity against England. Yet in his heart he had no inclination for war. He felt the truth of Waking ham's argument, that any prolonged struggle at this moment with England would be fatal to his hopes of succession ; and he flattered himself that he had the reins over the Catholic lords and the Spanish intriguers so completely in his hands, that he could command peace with England at whatever moment the queen chose to have his amity on his own terms. In such a hope it turned out that he was deceived. The Catholic party, supported by the money of Spain, commanding nearly all the northern counties, and having with them the sympathies of the people, who were enraged at the execution of Mary, gained in a short time a strength on which he had not calculated, and far from being bridled, for some time dictated terms to him. But it is time to return from this digression to the course of events in Scotland. The king, who was now on the eve of his majority, assembled a convention of his nobility at Edinburgh, and determined to despatch ambassadors to the courts of France and Denmark.1 To Henry the Third he 1 Moyse's Memoirs. Bannatync edition, p. 64."], [138, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1587. 132 proposed a renewal of the ancient league between the two kingdoms ; whilst to the Danish monarch he made overtures of a matrimonial alliance.1 But Henry, who was at this moment disposed to be on favourable terms with England, treated James's advances coldly ; and although the Danish alliance eventually took place, its first suggestion does not appear to have been very cordially welcomed.2 The same convention was signalized by an event which brought a merited punishment on one of the basest of men. This was the fall of the Master of Gray, who was tried for high treason, condemned, and on the point of being executed, when his life was spared, and the sentence changed to banishment, at the intercession of the Earl of Huntley and Lord Hamilton. His accuser was Sir William Stewart, now about to proceed on the French embassy ; and in his dittay, or indictment, which has been preserved, were contained various points of treason.3 But his most flagrant offence, which was completely proved, was the base betrayal of his trust in his recent nego tiation in England, where he secretly recommended the death, instead of pleading for the life, of the Scot tish queen. At first, with his wonted effrontery, he attempted to brazen out the matter and overawe his enemies; but in the end he pleaded guilty; and, as abject as he had been insolent, threw himself on the king's mercy. None lamented his disgrace ; for, although still young in years, Gray was old in false- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

Brilliant, fascinating, highly edu cated, and universally reputed the handsomest man of his time, he had used all these advantages for the most profligate ends ; and his life, which to the surprise of many was now spared, had been little else than a tissue of treachery. He retired to France ; and although, after some years, he was again permitted to return to Scotland, he never recovered the commanding station from which he fell.1 James had now attained majority, and important subjects began to occupy his mind. Amid much that was frivolous and volatile, this young prince sometimes evinced a sagacity in detecting abuses, and a vigour in devising plans for the amelioration of his kingdom, which surprised even those who knew him best. To reconcile his nobility, and extinguish those fierce and sanguinary family feuds which so frequently defied the laws and tore the kingdom in pieces ; to arrange the affairs of the Kirk, provide for its ministers, and establish a certain form of ecclesiastical polity ; to escape from the pressure of an enormous debt by re covering the crown lands, which had been greatly dilapidated during his minority ; and to take some decisive steps on the subject of his marriage: these were the chief points which now pressed themselves upon his attention, and to which he directed the labours of his principal minister, the Secretary Maitland. But difficulties encountered him at every step. Outwardly, indeed, the king's desire for a reconciliation amongst the nobles was accomplished ; and at the conclusion of the parliament held in the capital,2 the principal street exhibited a singular spectacle. A table was 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Woddrington to Walsingham, 29th April, 1587. Ibid.

Bothwell and Angus, Hume and Fleming, Glammis and Crawford, with many other fierce opponents who had been compelled by their sovereign's threats or entreaties to an unwill ing embrace, marched hand in hand to take their seats at the board of concord, where they drank to each other amid the thunder of the castle guns, and the songs and shouts of the citizens. It was an im posing ceremony, but really an idle and hollow farce. The deep wounds of feudal hatred, and the sacred duty of feudal revenge, were not so easily cured or forgotten ; and many of the hands now locked in each other were quivering with a desire to find occupation rather in grappling the throat than pledging the health of their brother. Before the year concluded, all accordingly was nearly as bad as before. There was one point, however, on which all seemed agreed \u2014 a desire to attack England and avenge the death of Mary. So deep was this feeling, that Thirl stane, now raised to the high office of chancellor, in closing the parliament, made a stirring appeal to the assembled estates; and such was the impression of his eloquence, that the nobles, in a transport of pity and enthusiasm, threw themselves upon their knees before the king, and, amid the clang of their weapons and imprecations against Elizabeth, took a vow that they would hazard their lives and fortunes in the quarrel.1 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

JAMES VI. 135 These indications encouraged Huntley and the potent faction of the Catholic lords to a renewal, or rather more active continuance, of their intrigues with Spain and the Low Countries. Messengers were despatched thither, (not without the connivance of James,) who held out hopes to Philip of Scottish assistance in his great enterprise against England.1 Various Jesuits and seminary priests in disguise (of whom Gordon and Dury were the most active) glided through North umberland into Scotland, proceeded to the late con vention at Edinburgh, and from thence to Aberdeen, where they continued their efforts, in conjunction with their foreign brethren, for the re-establishment of the Catholic faith and the dethronement of Elizabeth.2 Apparently, all this was encouraged by the Scottish king. It is, indeed, sometimes exceedingly difficult to get at the real sentiments of a prince who prided himself upon his dissimulation : but, either from policy or necessity, he was soon so utterly estranged from England, and so completely surrounded by the Spanish faction, that Elizabeth began to be in serious alarm.3 That great princess was at this moment surrounded by dangers of no ordinary magnitude. Philip the Second of Spain was collecting against her that mighty armament, which was idly deemed to be invincible. The ports of Spain and Flanders rang with the din of arms and the bustle and confusion of military preparation. The queen had been persuaded by Burghley and her chief councillors, that the exe cution of the Queen of Scots would prove a death- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

' But she was miserably disappointed. The accounts of the death of Mary were received by nearly the whole of Christendom with one loud burst of astonishment and indignation. No sovereign had enforced more rigidly than Elizabeth the dogma of the inviolability and divine right of princes, and their responsibility to God alone. The doctrine was gene rally received and acted upon by her royal allies ; and they now arraigned her as an apostate from her own principles, and an open despiser of all that was holy, just, and true. Mary's servants and household were many of them foreigners ; and, returning to their homes, spread over the continent the touching story of her death. The hypocritical pretences of the Queen of England, by which she had endeavoured to shield herself from the odium of the execution, were generally discredited. It was said that, for the gra tification of her own private revenge, she had not scrupled to stain her hands with the blood of an innocent queen ; and that, to escape the infamy of the fact, she had meanly and falsely thrown the blame upon an innocent councillor. The press teemed throughout Catholic Europe with innume rable publications: histories, poems, pamphlets, and funeral orations, were circulated in every quarter on the alleged martyrdom of the Scottish queen, and the execrable guilt of her by whom she had been mur dered.

JAMES VI. 137 Henry the Eighth. The effect of all this, and the impression it made upon the Catholic mind through out Christendom, was great ; and when Philip began his mighty preparations against England, the projected invasion of that country partook of something like the sanctity of a crusade. Surrounded by such complicated difficulties, it was not without alarm that Elizabeth heard of the estrange ment of the Scottish king, and the hold proceedings of her enemies the Catholic lords. Confident of the assistance of Spain, with whose vast preparations they were well acquainted, they hoped to revolutionize Scotland, get possession of the king's person, destroy his Protestant advisers, and re-establish the Catholic religion.1 It was one principal branch of their plan to produce a diversion against England in Ireland and the Western Isles, which should take place at the moment of the invasion by the Armada. For the accomplishment of these great designs, Lord Maxwell, a leading and powerful Catholic lord, was on the continent in communication with Spain and Rome ; Archibald Douglas was suspected to be seconding their efforts in England, and the disgraced Master of Gray in France ; whilst Sir William Stewart, the brother of the once-powerful Arran, was busy at the head-quarters of the Prince of Parma.2 In Scotland, Huntley, the great leader of the Catholic lords, with Lord Claud Hamilton, Mar, Angus, and Bothwell, were prepared, on the briefest warning, to assemble a force which the king, in his present circumstances of poverty and desertion, could not control.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 138 usual in Scotland, schemes of private assassination were mixed up with plots against the government: not only the Chancellor Maitland but the king him self considered their lives in danger;1 and James, in self-defence, was compelled to dissemble, and to aim at a neutrality which promised a temporary security.2 But throughout all this the real sentiments of the monarch experienced no alteration. He continued firm in his opposition to Spain, true to the reformed religion, and ready to league with England the moment Elizabeth, throwing off her parsimony, showed a sincere determination to assist him with money and troops. This the imminent dangers with which she was sur rounded at length compelled her to do ; and Lord Hunsdon, her cousin, who had recently gained an intimate knowledge of the intrigues of France by robbing the French ambassador, Courcelles, of his despatches, was selected to open a communication with the King of Scots. But at this moment a cir cumstance, apparently slight, had nearly overturned all. Jane Kennedy, the daughter of a noble house, who had attended Mary in her last hours, suddenly arrived from France, obtained a private audience of the king, was closeted with him for twTo hours, and gave so touching an account of the tragedy at Fotheringay, that James refused to be comforted ; and denouncing vengeance, broke off the conferences with England. But these feelings were evanescent : the violence of the northern earls, the fear of losing Elizabeth and cutting himself out of the succession, restored him to his calmer mood ; and he despatched 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula D, sol.

Huntley and the Catholics, he said, were almost in open rebellion, earnestly pressing Philip and the Duke of Parma to attack England through Scotland ; and offering, the moment the Spaniards made their descent, to join them with a body of troops which should overwhelm Elizabeth.2 Against this there was little to oppose : for the Scottish king and the Kirk were on bad terms ; and the Chancellor Maitland, the only man of statesmanlike views, although in heart a Protestant and a friend to England, lived in hourly dread of assassination by Bothwell or some of his desperate associates.3 Under such trying circumstances, it says something for the King of Scots that he resisted the high offers made to him at this crisis by foreign princes, declared himself the determined opponent of Spain, resolved to support the reformed opinions, and co-operated cordially with the Queen of England. He assured Elizabeth that she could not detest more deeply than himself the plots of the Papists ; that none of the messengers of Antichrist, their common enemy, should be encouraged ; and that his single reason for suspending their usual loving intelligence, was a feeling that she had failed to vindicate herself from the guilt of his mother's blood.

But the ambassador promised far more than the queen had the least intention of performing. His royal mistress, he said, was ready to settle a duchy on her good brother, with a yearly pension of five thousand pounds. She would immediately raise for him a body-guard of fifty Scottish gentlemen ; and, to meet the danger of a revolt by the Popish lords on the approach of the Armada, she would levy a corps of a hundred horse and a hundred infantry to act upon the borders.2 With these high offers James immediately closed ; and Walsingham, for whose piercing glance and universal intelligence nothing was too minute or remote, having discovered that Thomas Fowler, au attached friend of the house of Lennox and a favourite of the Scottish king, was about to proceed on some private personal affairs to Edinburgh, contrived, through his means, to open a secret correspondence with James, and Maitland his chief minister, which enabled them to traverse and overthrow the designs of Huntley and the Spanish faction. 3 All this was of the utmost importance to Elizabeth.

This she did, accordingly, in the noblest and most effective manner : and the result is familiar to all, in the utter discomfiture and dispersion of that mighty armament. Not long after this occurred the assassination of the Duke of Guise and his brother the Cardinal of Lorraine, which removed two of her most powerful and talented opponents : so that, although the clouds still lowered, the imminency of the danger on the side of Spain and France had passed. James now naturally looked for the performance of her promises ; but he was cruelly disappointed. With the cessation of alarm, Elizabeth's deep-rooted habits of parsimony revived : the promised duchy with its princely revenue, the annual pension, the intended body-guard, the English auxiliaries to act upon the borders, melted away and were no more heard of. Ashby, the ambassador, it was alleged, had much exceeded his instructions ; and the king, in great wrath, complained that he had been dandled aud duped like a boy.1 These irritated feelings were encouraged by the Spanish faction. Many urged the king to seek revenge. Bothwell, ever anxious for broils, boasted that, without charging his master a farthing, he would bleed Elizabeth's exchequer at the rate of two hundred thousand crowns a-year, or lay the country waste to the gates of Newcastle.

The character of the young prince, and the dangerous and unsettled state of Scotland at this time, were strikingly described by Fowler in one of his letters to Walsingham. He found James, he said, a virtuous prince, stained by no vice, and singularly acute in the discussion of all matters of state, but indolent and careless ; and so utterly profuse, that he gave to every suitor, even to vain youths and proud fools, whatever they desired. He did not scruple to throw away, in this manner, even the lands of his crown ; and so reckless was he of wealth, that, in Fowler's opinion, if he were to get a million from England, it would all go the same way. His pleasures wTere hunting, of which he was passion- ately fond ; and playing at the maice, an English game of chance, in which he piqued himself on excelling. In his dress he was slovenly, and his court and house- hold were shabby and unkingly ; but he sat often in council, was punctual in his religious duties, not miss- ing the sermons thrice a-week ; and his manners be- trayed no haughtiness or pride. It was evident to Fowler that he detested the rude and ferocious bear- ing of his great nobles, who were content to obey him in trifles, but in all serious matters, touching life or justice, took the law into their own hands, and openly defied him. Upon this subject Fowler's expressions were remarkable. When it came to the execution of justice, it was evident, he said, his subjects feared him not, whilst he was terrified to deal with so many at once, looking tremblingly to the fate of his ancestors, of whom such as attempted to execute justice with severity, were uniformly put to death by their nobles.1 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Fowler to Walsingham, 18th"], [149, "1588. JAMES VI. 143 Often had the king assured the intimate friend who wrote these letters, that it was misery to be constrained to live amid the wickedness of his barons, and that they made his existence a burden to him. Nor could he look for redress to his council. Even the wisest and greatest amongst them, not excepting the Chan cellor Maitland, were infinitely more occupied in private quarrels and family feuds than with the public business of the state ; and, to increase their indivi dual power, were content to flatter the king in the basest manner, and become suitors at court for every thing ungodly and unreasonable. Well might Wal singham exclaim, in answer to this sad, dark picture of regal weakness and feudal misrule, \" God send that young prince, being of himself every way well-inclined, good, wise, and faithful counsellors, that may carry him in a constant course for the upholding of religion and the establishing of justice in that realm.\"2 As a cure for this miserable condition, the English secre tary recommended a Court of Star-chamber, and a change of councillors from the great nobles to the barons and burgesses. But neither measure was prac ticable ; and Maitland, at this moment James's chief adviser, assured Fowler that the death of the Guises, instead of being attended with any favourable result in strengthening the English party in Scotland, would have an opposite effect. \" Your queen,\" said he, \" thinks that she has lost in Guise a great enemy, and my master a great friend. Be assured it is not so. For a long time the king hath had no dealings with the Guise : he loved him not ; nor is he sorry but December, 1588.

But, mark me, this will make the King of Spain seek my master, and esteem him more than before : for by the Duke of Guise that prince thought to have had all France at his devotion, except the Protestants ; to have subdued even them ere long, and to have been so strong as to have had his revenge on England, without our help here ; but now Scotland is his only card to play against England, and that you will see ere long.\" ' These predictions were soon fully verified. The Popish earls, led by Huntley and Errol, entered into a more active and deep-laid correspondence with Spain and Rome. Large sums of money were remitted to them from Philip and the pope; and letters were intercepted by Burghley, which proved, in the clearest manner, an intended rebellion. They were seized on the person of a Scotsman, who was detected carrying them to the Prince of Parma ; and expressed, on the part of Huntley, Morton, Errol, and the rest of the Catholic noblemen and gentry of Scotland, their in finite regret at the discomfiture of the Armada, and their sorrow that the fleet had passed so near their coast without visiting them, when they were able to have raised a force such as could not have been resisted. They assured the Spanish king, that the outlay of a single Galeas in Scotland would have gone farther than ten on the broad seas; and that six thousand Spaniards, once lauded there, would be joined by an infinite multitude of Scotsmen animated with the bit terest hatred to England, and who would serve him as faithfully as his own subjects. Huntley at the same time assured Parma, that his late confession, and his signature to the Protestant Articles, had been extorted 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Fowler to Walsingham, 4th Jan. 1588-9."], [151, "1588-9. JAMES VI. 145 from him against his conscience ; but that in spite of all this he continued a true Catholic, and by this pre tended change had acquired a greater power over the young king. In the same letters Errol professed the utmost devotion to the Catholic faith, congratulating himself on having been called from darkness to light ; and Bruce informed Parma of the seasonable arrival of Chisholm, their agent, with the large sum intrusted to him, and of their having secured the Earl of Both well, who, though still a Protestant, had been bribed to embrace their party. Copies of these letters were instantly sent down to James, who at first disbelieved the whole story, and dealt so leniently with the principal conspirators, that the plot, instead of being crushed in its first growth, spread its ramifications throughout the country, espe cially the northern counties, and grew more dangerous than before. Huntley was, indeed, imprisoned ; but his confinement was a mere farce. The king visited him in his chamber and dined there; permitted his wife and servants to communicate freely with him ; wrote him an affectionate remonstrance, and even kissed and caressed him.1 This could end only one way. The captive, after a brief imprisonment, during which he made the most solemn asseverations of his innocence, was restored by the too credulous monarch to his former authority, and basely abused the royal forgiveness by seducing the fierce and potent Earl of Bothwell from his allegiance, and breaking into open rebellion. This insurrection at first assumed the most formi dable appearance : the whole of Scotland north of Aberdeen was on the eve of revolt; and Bothwell 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Ashby to Burghley, Edinburgh, 10th March, 1588-9.

But this bravado, instead of intimidating, effectually roused the king, who, for the first and almost the last time in his life, exhibited a military spirit worthy of his ancestors. An army was instantly assembled ; a conspiracy for the seizure of James and his chief minister, Maitland the chancellor, promptly discovered and defeated.1 The Protestant nobles, led by the young Duke of Lennox and the chancellor, rallied in great strength ; the Earl of Mar, the three lords warden, Hume, Cessford, and Carmichael, the Earls of Morton, Angus, Marshal, Athole, and the Master of Glammis, gathered and concentrated their forces beyond the Forth ; and the monarch, who was described by Ashby the English ambassador, as \"fellon crabbed,\" pushed on, at the head of his troops, to St. Johnston, loudly declaring his resolution to wreck his rebels, and destroy them with fire and sword.2 This vigour and resolution had the best effect. The formidable stories of the mighty strength and pre parations of the Catholic earls were found false and ridiculous, \u2014 their troops melted away. Bothw-ell's force, which was to effect such wonders, soon shrunk to thirty horse ; and James, advancing by Dundee and Brechin, carried every thing before him, and com pelled the rebels to evacuate Aberdeen, the centre of their strength. It had been expected that the enemy would here give battle, but their courage failed them. Crawford secretly fled ; others openly deserted ; and the king, who had shown unusual hardihood, and watched two nights in his arms, was disappointed of 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Ashby to Burghley, April 8, 1589. 2 Ibid.

But the expedition was completely successful; Huntley was driven from Aberdeen to Strathbogie, his own country, where he surrendered himself prisoner, and was carried in triumph by the king to Edinburgh. Slakes, the principal castle of Errol, was taken and garrisoned ; the Lairds of Frendraught, Grant, and Mackintosh, the powerful clans of the Drummonds and the For beses, with many others who had been seduced from their allegiance by the Catholic faction, submitted themselves ; and James, in high spirits and exultation, returned to his capital with the resolution of proceed ing instantly against Bothwell. But this fierce chief, who was now crest-fallen and in no state to make resistance, threw himself on his knees before the king in the chancellor's garden, and was sent prisoner to Holyrood.1 A convention of the nobility was now held at Edinburgh ; and the rebel earls, Huntley and Craw ford, having been brought to trial and convicted of high treason, escaped with imprisonment, contrary to the remonstrances of the leaders of the Kirk, who clamoured for the death of idolaters. Their confes sion, however, had softened the king ; and their high connexions rendered it dangerous to use extremities. Bothwell also was brought to trial ; but, after his usual fierce fashion, declared his innocence ; reviled and accused the chancellor, and stood on his defence. The circumstance of his being in arms against the government, and his cordial co-operation with the northern rebellion, was, indeed, notorious to all ; but the dread of his power and revenge intimidated the court. The trial was prolonged till midnight ; and it 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Ashby to Walsingham, May 12, 1589."], [154, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1589. 148 required the presence and remonstrances of the king to procure a conviction. He was then shut up in Tantallon;1 but was enlarged, after a few months, on payment of a heavy fine to the crown.2 This unusual exertion of James in destroying the designs of Huntley and the Catholics, was followed by a fit of extraordinary activity on another subject : his marriage with Denmark. At the time of the first proposal of a matrimonial alliance with this kingdom, Arran was in power, and had engaged to Elizabeth that his royal master should continue single for three years. Accordingly, on the arrival of the Danish ambassadors, they found themselves treated with such irritating coldness and neglect, that it required much management on the part of Sir James Melvil to pre vent an open rupture, and convince them that the affront proceeded not from the young king but his haughty minister.3 His endeavours, however, suc ceeded ; and although the Danish 'monarch, in some disgust, disposed of his eldest daughter, the princess royal, the intended bride of James, to the Duke of Brunswick, he afterwards declared his willingness to bestow her sister, the Princess Anne, upon the Scot tish king. The intrigues of England, however, con tinued. Elizabeth, who had gained to her interest the Chancellor Maitland, recommended the Princess of Navarre ; and the celebrated poet Du Bartas visited Scotland on a secret mission to propose the match. This preference probably proceeded from a suspicion that the Princess Anne was not sound in her attach ment to the Protestant opinions, which afterwards 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Ashby to Walsingham, 25th May, 1589.

JAMES VI. 149 turned out to be well founded; but James utterly disrelished the dictation of the queen and the bold ness of his council. It was time, he felt, that in so weighty a matter as his marriage, he should vindicate his liberty of choice and follow his own judgment : he had, besides, heard a report that the Princess of Navarre was old and crooked; and although his great nobles affected the alliance with France, the bulk of his people, the burgh towns and the merchants, were all keen for Denmark.1 This decided the young king ; and he now despatched the earl marshal, with a noble suite, to proceed to Copenhagen and conclude the match. On his arrival, the Scottish ambassador found that, if cold or slow at first, the Danish court were hot enough (to use Ashby's expression to Walsingham) as soon as there was a serious proposal made. All was soon arranged, and the utmost bustle prevailed. In some amusing contemporary letters, the queen- mother is described as the soul and centre of the whole preparations \u2014 perpetually buying silks, or cheapening jewellery, or urging on a corps of five hundred tailors, who sat daily stitching and getting up the most princely apparel. Women, guards, pages, lackeys, all, from the highest to the lowest, who were to com- pose the suite of the bride, received orders to hold themselves in readiness. A fleet of twelve sail, with brass ordnance, was fitted out to transport her ; and it was reported that she was likely to land in Scotland before James's wedding hose were ready, or a house furnished to receive her.2 But these anticipations 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Ashby to Walsingham, 22d July, 1589.

This did not prevent him, how ever, from forwarding to his ambassadors a gentle remonstrance touching the smallness of the \" tocher,\" or dowery ; but Denmark refused to add a farthing to it ; and the monarch, affecting the utmost anxiety for the young princess, who, he had persuaded himself, was utterly in despair and love-sick at the delay, urged her instant departure.1 At length she sailed ; but the squadron encountered a tremendous storm, which shattered and dispersed the ships, and compelled them to return to Norway in so leaky and disabled a condition, that every hope of resuming their voyage for that season was abandoned.2 During all this period of suspense, the young king's romantic agitation continued. He was a true lover, as Ashby described him to Walsingham in a letter from the court at Holyrood, thinking every day a year till he saw his love and joy approach ; at one time, flying to God, and commanding prayers and fasting for her safe arrival ; at another, falling upon the Scottish witches, to whose unhallowTed rites and incantations he ascribed the tempests which delayed her. Nor were these pre tended agonies : for when at last the news arrived of her danger and escape, he suddenly adopted the idea of proceeding in person to Norway, and determined (to use the poetic phraseology of Ashby to Queen Elizabeth) \"to commit himself and his hopes, Leander 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Fowler to Walsingham, Aug. 5,1589. 2 Ibid.

On the day after his departure, a declaration of the reasons which had prompted so unusual a step was delivered to the privy council, and afterwards made public. It was written wholly in the king's hand, and is ludicrously characteristic of the monarch. We learn from his own lips that it had been very generally asserted by his loving sub jects, that their sovereign was a \" barren stock,\" indis posed to marriage, and careless of having children to succeed him in the throne. Flis mind, too, had been attacked in most unmannerly terms : it was insinu ated that the chancellor \" led him by the nose,\" as if he were an unreasonable creature, a mere child in intellect and resolution, or an \" impudent ass that could do nothing of himself.\" To confute the first slander, he had determined to seek his queen forth with, and marry her as speedily as the winds and waves would permit. To give the lie to the second aspersion, he assured his people, on the honour of a prince, that he alone, unknown to chancellor or council, had conceived the first idea of this winter voyao-e ; that his resolution was taken in the solitude of his chamber at Craigmillar ; and that, till the pre parations Avere concluded, and he was ready to step on board, the purpose was shut up in his own bosom. \" Let no man, therefore, \" he concluded, \"grudge at 1 Spottiswood, pp. 377, 378."], [158, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1589. 152 this proceeding, but conform to the directions I have left.\"1 These directions, notwithstanding the undignified singularity of the paper which accompanied them, were marked by prudence and good sense. The chief authority, during the royal absence, was com mitted to the Duke of Lennox, who was made president of the privy council. Bothwell, whose turbulent disposition and power upon the borders rendered it dangerous for him to be disobliged, was conciliated by being placed next in rank and autho rity to Lennox. The other councillors wTere, the treasurer, comptroller, the lord privy-seal, the captain of the castle of Edinburgh, with the lord advocate and clerk-register. A committee of noblemen was ordered to attend \" in their courses,\" at Edinburgh, for fifteen days ; the Earls of Angus and Athole, with Lords Fleming and Innermeith, to begin ; and the next course to be kept by the Earls of Mar and Morton, with Lords Seton and Yester. The chief military power, as lord-lieutenant, was intrusted to Lord Hamilton, to be assisted in any emergency by Lords Boyd, Herries, Maxwell, Home, Cessford, and other principal barons within the marches. All con ventions of the nobles were prohibited during the king's absence ; and the ministers and preachers enjoined to exhort the people to obedience, and to commend their sovereign and his journey in their prayers to God.2 Having given these directions, the king set sail ; and his insulated fit of love and chivalry met with its reward. After an initiatory gale, just sufficient to try the royal courage, the squadron reached Upsal on the 1 Spottiswool, pp. 377, 378 379. 2 Ibid. p. 379."], [159, "1589.

Much rejoicing and banqueting, as usual, succeeded ; and it appears to have required little argument in the queen-mother to persuade her new son-in-law to eschew the dangers of a winter voyage, and convert his intended visit of twenty days into a residence of nearly six months in Denmark. This interval was passed by the king to his entire satisfaction, the time being divided between in-door revelries and pageants; out door sports ; discussions on astronomy with Tycho Brahe, whom he visited at Uranibourg ; disputes with the learned Hemingius, on predestination and other points in divinity ; and consultations with the Chan cellor Maitland, regarding the safest method of curbing the overgrown power of his nobles, and vindicating, on his return, the authority of the crown. In the spring he determined on his voyage home ; and carrying his youthful queen along with him, accompanied by a splendid retinue of Danish nobles and ladies,2 arrived at Leith on the 1st of May, 1590.

A Latin oration of welcome was followed by a sermon of Mr. Patrick Galloway ; and after divine service, the king, mounting his horse, followed by his youthful bride in her chariot, drawn by eight horses gorgeously caparisoned, proceeded to the palace of Holyrood. She was encircled by a galaxy of Danish and Scottish beauty, and attended by all the chivalry of her new dominions. Her coronation followed not long after, performed on a scale of unusual magnificence, and only clouded by a dispute between the king and the Kirk, on the subject of anointing ; a ceremony represented on the side of the Puritans as Jewish, Papal, and abominably superstitious : on the other, as Christian, holy, and Catholic. The royal arguments, however, were en forced by a threat that one of the bishops should be sent for. The dread of this worse profanation procured the admission of the lesser : the ceremony wras allowed to proceed according to the king's wishes ; and, to use the naive expression of a contemporary, \" the Countess of Mar, having taken the queen's right arm, and opened the craigs of her gown, Mr. Robert Bruce immediately poured forth upon those parts of her breast and arm of quhilk the clothes were removed, a bonny quantity of oil.\" x The coronation was followed by the queen's tri umphal entry into her new capital ; a ceremony con ducted by the worthy merchants and burgesses on a scale of splendour which argued increasing wealth and 1 The Coronation of the Quenis Majestie, p. 53.

Nor was the peace of the country, in this brief and happy interval, broken by the usual sanguinary baronial feuds; although, as the result fully showed, they were silenced, not eradicated. Huntley, Errol, Crawford, Maxwell, and the great body of the Roman Catholic party, had too recently experienced the weight of the royal vengeance to think of active hostility for some time ; and the judicious division of power between the Duke of Lennox, Lord Hamilton, and the Earl of Bothwell, balanced by the authority committed to Angus and Athole, Mar and Morton, with other great barons, produced the best effects, and put all upon their honour and good con duct. The Kirk, too, was in a state of tranquillity \u2014 rejoicing in the recent detection and discomfiture of Roman Catholic intrigue, looking forward in calm exultation to the utter extermination of prelatical principles, and anticipating no distant triumph to what it believed to be the truth. On the return of the king, therefore, all at first appeared tranquil ; but it needed no deep discernment to detect the existence of many latent causes of dis turbance. The great struggle between the principles of the Reformation and the ancient faith was lulled only, not concluded.1 The minor, but sometimes not less bitter contest between Prelacy and Presbyterian ism, was merely suspended for a time. Amongst the nobles, the right of private war; the ties of manrent; the abuses of baronial jurisdictions ; the existence of blood-feuds, which often from trifling quarrels depopu lated whole districts and counties ; and in the isles, and remoter provinces of the north, the lawless and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir R.

Amid these elements of political strife and nascent revolution, two men were to be seen evidently destined, from their power and political position, to take the chief lead in state affairs. Both were w7ell aware of the easy and indolent temper of the king ; both had resolved to engross to themselves the supreme power in the government : and for some years, the history of the country is little else than the conflicts of their intrigue and ambition. These were, Maitland of Thirlstane the chancellor, James's favourite and prime minister, who had accompanied his royal master to Denmark; and Francis Stewart earl of Bothwell, the king's near relative, and, perhaps, the most daring, powerful, and unprincipled of all the higher nobles. Maitland, born of an ancient family, but only the second son of a simple knight, (the blind poet Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington,) belonged to the body of the lesser barons; but he was connected with some of the greatest houses in the land. He had risen by his commanding talents to the highest legal office in the kingdom ; and he was strong in the friendship of his prince, and the respect of the Kirk and the great body of the middle classes \u2014 the rich burghers, merchants, and artisans. During his absence in Denmark with his royal master, they had held many grave consultations on the broken, disjointed, and miserable state of his kingdom. The extreme poverty of the crown, the insolence and intolerable oppressions of the higher barons, who, strong in their"], [165, "1590. JAMES VI. 159 hereditary power, dictated to the monarch on all the affairs of his government, thrust themselves uncalled for into his councils, attended or absented themselves from court at their pleasure, and derided alike the command of their prince or the decisions of the laws : all this was pointed out by the chancellor to the king, and the absolute necessity of some speedy and efficient reformation insisted on. It was time, he said, that the monarch, who was now in the prime of his years and vigour, allied by marriage to a powerful prince, the heir of a mighty kingdom, and able, from his position, to take a leading part in European politics, should no longer be bearded by every baron who chose to consider himself as a born councillor of the realm. It was time that those illegal coalitions of the nobles, whose object it had so often been to seize the king's person, and compel him into an approval of all their atrocious designs, should be broken up, and for the future rendered impossible. To effect this, the crown must strengthen itself in every possible way : it must support its judges and officers in the execution of their duty against baronial oppression and insolence ; it must increase its revenues by a prudent economy and retrenchment of the superfluous offices in the royal household ; it must save its escheats, its ward ships, its fines, its rentals, and all the sources of its wealth, to form a fund for all emergencies, but espe cially for the support of a body of waged troops, who, by their constant readiness for service, and superior discipline, might overawe the nobles and their vassals. To effect this would require some sacrifices on the part of the prince. Amongst these, a more rigid and practical attention to business, a correction of the mischievous habit of granting every petition without inquiry, and a resolution to hold himself more distant"], [166, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1590. 160 and dignified to his nobility, were absolutely neces sary ; but if ready to consent to these, it would not, he said, be difficult to effect a thorough reformation ; and he, the chancellor, for his part, was ready to back the king to the utmost of his power to accomplish it. To this end, he represented to James the wisdom of keeping up the present friendly relations with Eng land, and the necessity of watching the motions of Huntley and the Roman Catholic party, who, though apparently subdued and silent, were still powerful in the kingdom, busy in their intrigues with Spain, and ready to seize any opportunity for a new effort.1 Nor was there any reason why this large and powerful body of men should despair of success, but rather the contrary. Ample proof of this may be found in a remarkable paper in the hand of Lord Burghley, written shortly before James's arrival from Denmark, and drawn up apparently for his own guidance, which brings forward, in clear contrast, the comparative strength of the Catholic and Protestant parties in Scotland. From it we learn, that all the northern part of the kingdom, including the counties of Inver ness, Caithness, Sutherland, and Aberdeen, with Moray, and the sheriffdoms of Buchan, of Angus, of Wigton, and of Nithsdale, were either wholly, or for the greater part, in the interest of the Roman Catholic party, commanded mostly by noblemen who secretly adhered to that faith, and directed in their movements by Jesuits and priests, who wTere concealed in various parts of the country, especially in Angus. On the other hand, the counties of Perth and Stirling, the populous shire of Fife, and the counties of Lanark, Dunbarton, and Renfrew, including the rich district 1 MS. State-paper Office, Sir R. Bowes to Lord Burghley, May 16. 1590. '"], [167, "1590. JAMES VI. 161 of Clydesdale, were, with few exceptions, Protestant ; whilst the counties of Ayr and Linlithgow were dubious, and could not be truly ranged either on one side or the other.1 Are we to be surprised that, in a country thus divided, and with a prince so little able to adopt a firm and determined line of policy as James then was, the struggle between the two parties should long be kept up with increasing obstinacy and asperity ? But it is necessary to leave these general remarks and resume our narrative. In the end of May, the Danish commissioners and nobles, who had accompanied their young princess to Scotland, took leave of the Scottish monarch, and returned to Denmark. It had been arranged be tween James and his chief minister, Maitland, that no attempt at reformation should be made till these strangers had left the country ; but scarcely had they embarked, when the king exhibited an unusual courage and activity, by makng an effort to seize, with his own hand, the Laird of Niddry, a baron who had been guilty of a foul murder, and was protected by Bothwell. This energy, although unsuccessful at the moment, (for the culprit, receiving warning, escaped,) had a good effect in convincing the country that he was in earnest ; and about the same time the strictest regulations as to audience were enforced at the palace. Of this an instance occurred soon after, which made some noise. Lord Hamilton, the first nobleman in the country, and heir-apparent to the throne, sought, as usual, to enter the king's presence-chamber, but was stopped at the door by Sandilands, one of the royal suite, who told him the king was quiet, and would see no one. \" I was sent for,\" said Hamilton ; 1 MS.

L"], [168, "162 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1590. \" I am ready to serve my prince, and thought to have access freely as I was wont ; but you may tell the king, that this new order will offend more than me.\" He then left the palace in a high fume, and would have ridden home had he not been better advised. James afterwards good humouredly appeased him ; observing, that it ill became the heir-apparent to be angry with the old laird, meaning himself. Bowes, however, who was at court, and told the anecdote to Burghley, observed, that such new restrictions gave deep offence in Scotland, and caused much murmuring with a proud nobility, long accustomed to have the freest access to their sovereign.1 Such discontent, however small in its beginning, soon spread widely ; and unknown evils and. reforms being generally magnified in anticipation, the king's intentions created an alarm, which showed itself in a coalition between those who hitherto had been in constant and bitter collision \u2014 the Catholic faction, known by the name of the Confederates of the Brig of Dee, and the Protestant associates of the Enterprise at Stirling. The Earls of Huntley, Errol, Bothwell, and Montrose, began to league together ; and James had at first resolved to attempt a stroke of state policy by committing them to ward, bringing them to trial for their former offences, and at once destroying so dangerous a combination. But the attempt was deemed too hazardous ; and it was judged more prudent to temporize, and keep up the two factions, balancing the one against the other.2 A convention of the nobles was appointed to be held early in June. \"The king,\" said Bowes to Burghley, alluding to his projected improvements, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, May 23, 1690, Bowes to Burghley.

He purposeth, further, to resume into his hands sundry of his own possessions now in the holding of others ; to advance his revenues with some portions of ecclesiastical livings ; and to draw to due obedience all persons attainted at horn, excom municated, or otherwise disobedient. In the execution of which things,\" continued the ambassador, \" he will find no little difficulty; for I have heard that many intend to seek to defeat and stay the king's course herein ; and that sundry of the sessions will stand in law to hold their places, notwithstanding any charge to be given to avoid them.\"1 James, for some time, was active and serious in these reforms. His household was greatly reduced in its expenditure. After a general dismissal of officers, which occasioned many murmurs, the gentle men personally attendant on royalty were cut down from thirty to four, with two pages ; and the monarch drew up, in his own hand, some principal matters relative to domestic and foreign policy, upon which he required the immediate advice of his privy council. They must consider, he said, the state of the strengths and munitions, and the necessary provision to be made for the defence of the kingdom, in case of foreign inva sion ; the treaties required to be entered into, for the preservation of foreign amity ; the best measures to be adopted for the procuring secret foreign intelli gence ; the \" griefs of the nobility and people, as well against the king as the government of his councillors ; the necessity of a rigid investigation into the true state 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, May 31, 1590, Bowes to Burghley."], [170, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 164 1590. of the realm;\" the \"ettling\"1 and disposition of the nobility, and other persons of power and credit.

Such were the grave and weighty matters which the king now brought before his council.2 But these were not all : the monarch had resolved to exert his utmost efforts to heal the wounds, not of Scotland only, but of Europe, by establishing a peace between England and Spain. To effect this, he de spatched Colonel Stewart and Sir John Skene on a mission to the princes of Germany, to persuade the Palsgrave, the Duke of Saxony, the Marquis of Brand enburg, and the rest of these potentates, of the abso lute necessity of interfering between these two mighty powers ; and to recommend them to send ambassadors to England, France, and Spain, who might remonstrate on the miserable consequences of the continuance of the war. If Spain were obstinate, a general league was to be concluded amongst the princes, for the preservation of \" the common cause of true religion ; and their ports were to be shut against Philip till he was reduced to reason.\"3 1 The ettling, the aim ; to ettle, to aim.

JAMES VI. 165 These great designs the king communicated to Elizabeth by Sir John Carmichael, whom he sent to the English court with a copy of the Instructions furnished to his German ambassadors ; and as his exchequer was at this time utterly impoverished, he requested that princess to lend him sufficient to defray the expenses of their voyage ; declaring his readiness, in return, to place upon his privy council any noble man whom she recommended, and to exert his utmost strength in crushing the Roman Catholic faction, who were renewing their intrigues with Spain.1 The \"band,\" or covenant, which united Huntley, Errol, and their associates, in their recent treasonable enter prise, had been traced to the hands of the Laird of Auchendown, and Maitland the chancellor insisted on its being produced ; assuring Elizabeth, with whom he was then in great favour, that the association should be broken up or Huntley wrecked for ever.2 To confirm the monarch in such good purposes, the Queen of England sent him the Garter by the Earl of Worcester, who arrived in Edinburgh during the sitting of that convention from which such important reformations were to have proceeded.

It assured him that she was happy to find him so grateful a king ; that she highly approved of his purpose ; and that nothing could equal the careful thoughts for him and his realm which had occupied her since his peregrination. \" And so,\" said she, \" I leave scribbling, but never end to love you and assist you with my friendship, care, and prayer to the living God to send you all prosper ous success, and his Holy Spirit for guide.\"* * MS. letter, State-paper Office.

When reformation of justice was debated, the Lords of Session professed, indeed, the utmost readiness to amend all ; and two of their number, Mr. David Makgill and Mr. John Graham, indulged very freely and bitterly in mutual accusations of bribery and corruption ; but the rest pleaded their privilege, granted by act of parliament, to \" try them selves.\" With regard to the Kirk, when its leaders insisted that every parish should be provided with a minister, and every minister with a stipend, no objec tion was made by the nobles to the proposal, in gene ral ; but \" the possessors of the church lands declared their determination not to surrender any portion of their tacks and leases unless the remainder should be secured to them in fee-simple for ever.\"2 In the end, however, some points were gained, which pleased both James and the English queen, who now acted together with much cordiality. The choice of the king's secret council was left to his own will, and Elizabeth knew she would be chiefly con sulted. The monarch, strengthened by the approval of the wisest sort, led by the chancellor, held the Roman Catholic faction in awe ; restrained the inso lence of Bothwell ; insisted on the appearance and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Earl of Worcester to Burghley, Edinburgh, lSkh June, 1590, *\u2022 Ibid."], [173, "' JAMES VI. 1590. 167 delivery of all \" at the horn\" who had hitherto defied the law; took steps for the speedy and amicable settlement of all border causes ; adopted measures to amend the coin, which had been much debased ; and, whilst he continued his favour towards the Kirk, did not scruple to silence some of the wilder sort of the brethren, who in their public sermons had attacked the Queen of England for her recent severity to the English Puritans. On this last subject, the excesses of the Puritans, Elizabeth felt keenly ; and her far sighted glance had already detected the dangers of a sect then only in their infancy, but professing prin ciples which she deemed inconsistent with the safety of any well-governed state. Worcester had received pointed instructions in the matter;1 and the queen herself, when she dismissed Sir John Carmichael the Scottish ambassador, enforced her wishes in a private letter to James, which is too characteristic to be omitted. It is as follows : \u2014 \" Greater promises, more affection, and grants of more acknowledgings of received good turns, my dear brother, none can better remember than this gentleman, by your charge, hath made me understand ; whereby I think all my endea vours well recompensed, that see them so well acknow ledged ; and do trust that my counsels, if they so much content you, will serve for memorials to turn your actions to serve the turn of your safe government, and make the lookers-on honour your worth, and reverence such a ruler. \" And lest fair semblances, that easily may beguile, do not breed your ignorance of such persons as either pretend religion or dissemble devotion, let me warn you that there is risen, both in your realm and mine, 1 MS.

When O'Rourke, au Irish chieftain, was detected in Glasgow, secretly beating up for recruits against the English, the King of Scots scrupled not to have him seized and delivered to Elizabeth. \" I would to God,\" said he, writing to the queen, \" your greatest enemies were in my hands ; if it were the King of Spain himself, he should not be long undelivered to you : for that course have I taken me to, and will profess it till I die, that all your foes shall be common enemies to us both, in spite of the pope, the King of Spain, and all the leaguers, my cousins not excepted, and the devil their master.\" 2 In return for this devotion to her wishes, Elizabeth, forgetting her economy, transmitted, at various inter vals, large sums to the king, complimented the young queen with presents, and flattered her by letters ; whilst the chancellor, who had now consolidated his power, and could bid defiance to his opponents, entered into a cordial correspondence with Burghley. He reminded him of the \" old familiar acquaintance and strict amity\" which had subsisted between him and his late brother, the well-known Lethington ; and declared his readiness and anxiety to show himself worthy of the lord treasurer's friendly dealing and gentle messages sent recently by Carmichael. Speak ing modestly of his own inferiority, he yet hoped that 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 14th Aug. 1590. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office. Royal Letters.

The difficulty is, to discover whether they were the victims of their own imagination, the dupes of impostors, or, which is not to be rejected as impossible or incredible, the sub jects and recipients of diabolic influence and agency. During the summer of this year, the young Laird of Wardhouse had been seized with a mortal sickness which had carried him to the grave ; and it was dis covered that several witches had formed his image in wax, which having \" roasted at a slow fire, the gentle man,\" it was said, \" pined away insensibly, but surely, till he died.\"1 This was alarming enough ; but in the winter still darker deeds came to light, involving higher culprits and more daring transactions. Agnes Sampson, a woman, as Spottiswood says, \" not of the base or ignorant sort of witches, but matronlike, grave, and settled in her answers,\" accused Bothwell of con sulting her as to the probable continuance of the king's life ; and Richard Graham, a notorious sorcerer, averred that the earl had sought him on the same errand. Agnes declared, when questioned by the judges, that \" she had a familiar spirit, who, upon her call, appeared in a visible form, and resolved her of any doubtful matters, especially concerning life and death. The mode in which she summoned him was by calling out \" Holla, Master ! \" an invocation which he had taught her himself.

The king, he said, by his own especial travel, had drawn Sampson, the great witch, to confess plainly her wicked estate and doings, and to discover sundry things touching his own life : how the witches sought to have had his shirt, or other linen about him, for the execution of their charms. In these doings the Lord Claud's name was implicated, and sundry other noble personages evil spoken of. The number of the witches known, were, (he added) about thirty ; but many others were accused of acts filthy, lewd, and fantastical.2 On a future occasion, the royal curiosity and acuteness were rewarded by the discovery of more particulars involving the guilt of Bothwell. They came out in an examination to which James subjected the wizard Richard Graham, who, upon some hope held out of pardon, confessed that Bothwell sought to draw him to devise some means to hasten the king's death, alleging that he was driven to this to avoid his own ; since a necromancer in Italy had predicted to him that he should become great in power and temporal possession, kill two men, fall into trouble with the king for two capital crimes, be pardoned for the first and suffer for the second. The three first events, he averred, had taken place as foretold him: he had become a mighty baron, had killed Sir William Stewart, and Dame the Devil, mean ing David Hume of Manderston ; been once pardoned ; and now he or the king must go. Graham agreed to assist him ; and James had the satisfaction of hearino- 1 Spottiswood, p. 383. * MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, Dec. 7, 1590."], [179, "1591.

An image of the royal person was formed of wax, and hung up between a tod, or fox, over which some spells had been muttered, and the head of a young calf, newly killed. It was added, that all this was well known to Jely Duncan, who is described by Bowes as a kind of whipper-in to the witches, being accustomed to scour the country and collect together all the Satanic fraternity and sisterhood. But although she admitted, at first, their dealings with Bothwell, she afterwards denied all ; and as these unfortunate wretches were so severely tortured that one of them died under the rack, it is impossible to receive their evidence without the utmost suspicion.1 Bothwell, however, amid loud assevera tions of innocence, was seized and sent to prison, and an early convention of the estates called for his trial. But the evidence, by the king's own admission, was slender ; the nobles seemed unwilling to countenance any violent proceedings against him ; and the matter was so long delayed, that his fierce temper would en dure confinement no longer ; and breaking his prison, he buried himself amongst his friends and fastnesses in the borders.2 This result greatly irritated the king, who consoled himself by bringing to trial one of the leading witches, named Barbara Napier, a woman well connected, and of whose conviction he entertained no doubt. To his astonishment, the jury did not conceive the evidence sufficient, and acquitted her. The verdict threw James into the greatest rage ; yet it was difficult to know what was now to be done.

James, however, shut his eyes to all difficulties, and determined to bring the refractory jurors to justice.1 Accordingly, on the 7th of June, repairing from Falkland, he sat in person on the trial of the delinquents. All of them pleaded guilty, and put themselves, as it was then termed, in the king's will, so that there was little scope given to the exercise of regal acuteness. He made an oration, however, some sentences of which give a good picture of the style of his oratory: often pedantic and tedious, but not un- frequently epigrammatic and sententious. Alluding to the shocking state of the country and the prevalence of crimes, \" I must advertise you,\" said he, \" what it is that makes great crimes to be so rife in this coun- try ; namely, that all men set themselves more for friend than for justice and obedience to the laws. This corruption here bairns suck at the pap ; and let a man commit the most filthy crimes that can be, yet his friends take his part ; and first keep him from appre- hension, and after, by fead or favour, by false assize, or some way or other, they find moyen of his escape : the experience hereof we have in Niddry.

So, however, it happened.

In the Highlands, the Earl of Huntley and the Earl of Moray, two of the greatest houses in the north, engaged in a deadly quarrel, which drew in the Lairds of Grant, Calder, Mackin tosh, and others, and made the fairest districts a prey to indiscriminate havock and murder.1 At court all was commotion and apprehension from the rivalry of the Master of Glammis, who began to be a favourite of the king, and Chancellor Thirlstane, who would brook no rival in power.2 On the borders, Bothwell welcomed every broken man and cruel murderer who chose to ride under his banner. Some time previous to the trials of the witches, this daring chief had in vaded the supreme court, and carried off a witness from the bar, who was about to give evidence against one of his retainers, whilst the king, although in the next room, did not dare to interfere.3 After his escape and triumph, his fierce temper impelled him to still greater excesses ; and attacking the palace of Holyrood at the head of his desperate followers, he had nearly surprised and made prisoners both the king aud the chancellor. Douglas of Spot, however, one of the principal leaders in this attack, lost time, by attempting to set at liberty some of his men who were imprisoned in the palace. An alarm was given : the king took refuge in one of the turrets ; the chan cellor barricaded his room, and bravely beat off the assailants; whilst the citizens of Edinburgh, headed by their provost, rushed into the outer court of the palace, and cutting their way through the outer ranks 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 7th December, 1590.

Meanwhile a tragedy occurred, which, even in that age, familiar with scenes of feudal atrocity, occasioned unusual horror. The reader may perhaps remember the utter destruction brought by the Regent Moray upon the great Earl of Huntley ; his execution, and that of one of his sons ; the forfeiture of his immense estates, and the almost entire overthrow of his house.2 It was now thirty years since that miserable event : the favour of the king had restored the family of Gordon to its estates and its honours, and Huntley's ambition might have been satisfied ; but the deep prin ciple of feudal vengeance demanded blood for blood ; and there was not a retainer of the house of Huntley, from the belted knight that sat at his master's right hand to the serving-man behind his chair, who did not acknowledge the sacred necessity of revenge. Time, which softens or dilutes most feelings, only added intensity to this : and now, when the hour of repay ment was come, the debt was exacted with fearful interest. The then Earl of Moray, a Stewart, and representative of the famous regent, was one of the bravest and handsomest men of his time, a favourite at court, and dear to the people and the Kirk, who 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Roger Ashton to Bowes, 28th Decem ber, 1691.

In deeds of arms and personal prowess, an old chronicle describes him as a sort of Amadis ; \"comely, gentle, brave, and of a great stature and strength of body.\"1 This young nobleman had princely possessions in the north, and for some years deadly feud had raged between him and Huntley ; but Lord Ochiltree, a Stewart, a firm friend of Moray's, was at this time exerting himself to bring about an agreement between the two barons ; and had so far succeeded, that Moray, with a slender retinue, left his northern fastnesses, and came to his mother's castle of Duni bersel, a short distance from the Queensferry. Huntley, his enemy, was then at court in constant attendance upon the king ; and Ochiltree, who had communicated with him, and informed him of Moray's wishes for a reconciliation, took horse and rode to Queensferry, intending to pass to Dunibersel and arrange an ami cable meeting between the rival earls. To his sur prise, he found that a royal order had been sent, in terdicting any boats from plying that day between Fife and the opposite coast. But little suspicion was occasioned : he believed it some measure connected with the hot pursuit then going on against Bothwell, and was satisfied to abandon his journey to Duni bersel. This proved the destruction of his poor friend. That very day, the 7th of February, the king hunted ; and Huntley, giving out that he meant to accompany the royal cavalcade, assembled his followers to the number of forty horse. Suddenly he pretended that certain news had reached him of the retreat of Both well ; extorted from the king permission to ride against this traitor ; and passing the ferry, beset the house of Historie of James the Sext, p. 246."], [185, "1591-2. JAMES VI. 179 Dunibersel, and summoned Moray to surrender. This was refused ; and in spite of the great disparity in numbers, the Stewarts resisted till nightfall, when Huntley collecting the corn-stacks, or ricks, in the neighbouring fields, piled them up against the walls, commanded the house to be set on fire, and compelled its unhappy inmates to make a desperate sally that they might escape being burnt alive. In this out- break the Sheriff of Moray was slain ; but the young- earl, aided by his great stature and strength, rushed forth all burned and blackened, with his long and beautiful tresses on fire and streaming behind him, threw himself with irresistible fury on his assailants, broke through the toils like a lion,1 and escaped by speed of foot to the sea-shore. Here, unfortunately, his hair and the silken plume of his helmet blazed through the darkness ; and his fell pursuers, tracing him by the trail of light, ran him into a cave, where they cruelly murdered him. His mortal wound, it was said, was given by Gordon of Buckie, who, with the ferocity of the times, seeing Huntley drawing back, cursed him as afraid to go as far as his followers, and called upon him to stab his fallen enemy with his dagger, and become art and part of the slaughter, as he had been of the conspiracy. Huntley, thus threatened, struck the dying man in the face with his weapon, who, with a bitter smile, upbraided him \" with having spoilt a better face than his own.\" 2 The outcry against this atrocious murder was deep and universal. Ochiltree, who had been deceived by Huntley and the chancellor, became loud in his clamours for revenge. In the north, Lord Forbes, 1 The simile is Ashton's, in a letter to Bowes.

In the capital, the Lady Doune, mother of the murdered earl, who with her daughters had nar rowly escaped death at Dunibersel, exhibited the mangled corpses of her son and his faithful follower the Sheriff of Moray in the church at Leith ; and Huntley, followed every where by a yell of public execration, fled first to Ravensheugh, a castle of Sinclair baron of Roslin, and afterwards to his own country in the north. Amid all this tumult and ardent demands for in stant justice and vengeance, the king exhibited such indifference, that strange suspicions arose, not only against James, but his great adviser the chancellor, between whom and Huntley there had arisen, for some time before Moray's murder, a suspicious familiarity. Huntley pleaded a royal commission for every thing he had done. It was known that the king had been deeply incensed against Moray by a report that he had abetted Bothwell in his late attempt, and had even been seen with him in the palace on the night of the attack. It was remembered that Ochiltree had been prevented, as was alleged, by a royal order sent through the chancellor, from passing the ferry on the day of the murder ; and the gossip of the court wTent even so far as to say, that the young queen's favour for Moray had roused the royal jealousy. All this was confirmed, as may well be believed, when Hunt ley, being summoned to deliver himself up and take his trial, obeyed with alacrity ; entered into ward in Blackness castle; and after a trifling investigation was dismissed and pardoned.1 Against this gross 1 Historie of James the Sext, p. 248,"], [187, "1592. JAMES VI. 181 partiality, Ochiltree, Lennox, Athole, and the whole friends of the murdered lord, loudly remonstrated. Bothwell, a Stewart, and cousin-german to Moray, availing himself of this favourable contingency, united his whole strength with theirs. The Kirk, indignant at the king's favour for Huntley, the head of the Roman Catholics, threw all its weight into the same scale ; and James soon found that Moray's death, slightly as he regarded it at first, drew after it fatal and alarming effects. In the north, the Earl of Athole, with the Lairds of Mackintosh, Grant, Lovat, and their followers, carried fire and sword into Hunt ley's country, and kindled throughout that region innumerable lesser feuds and quarrels, which, like the moor-burning of their own savage districts, spread from glen to glen, and mountain to mountain, till half the land seemed in a blaze.1 In the south, the Chan cellor Maitland was no longer able to guide the government with his usual steady and determined hand. Hitherto he had defied all court storms, and made a bold head against his enemies ; but his implication as a conspirator with Huntley in the murder of Moray, at first only suspected, but now, from some recent discoveries, absolutely certain, raised against him a universal detestation ; the hatred of the people added new strength to his opponents, and he was driven from court.2 This retreat of his chief adviser weakened James ; Elizabeth's coldness also annoyed him : and his un easiness was changed into indignation, when he dis covered that she looked favourably upon Bothwell; 1 Moyse's Memoirs, p. 98.

It was necessary, however, to dissemble his feelings, as the difficulties which now surrounded him were of a complicated kind. It had recently been his policy to balance the two great factions which divided the country, the Catholic and Protestant, as equally as possible : so that into which ever scale he threw the weight of his own authority it might preponderate. This mode of government, bor rowed from Elizabeth, was more difficult to be carried through with success in Scotland than in the neigh bouring country, not only from the superiority in vigour and intellect possessed by that princess over James, but from the greater feudal strength of the nobility of Scotland, and the greater weakness of the royal prerogative in that kingdom. In England vari ous causes had concurred to destroy the greater barons : the wars of the two Roses were especially fatal to them ; and it is well known that the reign of Henry the Eighth had been the grave of many of those potent families who, before that time, were in the habit of dictating to the crown. But in Scotland not only were the feudal prerogatives more large, but the arm of the law was weaker ; and the great houses, such as Hamilton, Argyle, Mar, Huntley, Douglas, and Stewart, were fresh and in vigour. Of all this the king was so well aware, that when Bowes, the English ambassador, on one occasion complained to him, that his reforms were ever in fieri, not in posse, James an swered, that to reform such nobles as he had, would require the lives of three kings.1 There can be no doubt, however, that James, al 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 25th January 1590-1. \""], [189, "1592. JAMES VI. 183 though clearly foreseeing the difficulties he was likely to encounter, had determined to weaken and suppress, as far as possible, the greater barons ; and had resolved by every means in his power to strengthen the crown, raise up the middle classes and the lesser barons ; and so balance and equalize the various powers of the con stitution, that he should be able to hold the reins with a firm hand. There is a passage of a letter of Hudson's, one of the king's favourites, and a gentle man of his court, which points to this ; and shows that, although James greatly favoured the chancellor, he was more his own minister than has been believed. Elizabeth, it appears, alarmed by some recent favours shown to Huntley, had instructed Hudson to gain this high officer, hoping through him to influence the king ; to which Hudson replied to Burghley, that the common opinion that James followed Maitland's guidance was an error ; that the king was \" himself the very centre of the government, and moved the chancellor and all the rest as he turned, minions and all. Although,\" he continued, \" he bestow favour in great measure upon sundries, it doth not follow that he is directed by them. The chancellor is a great councillor, and the king seeth that his gifts merit his place ; but he followeth directly his majesty's course in all.\" 1 Acting along with this able minister, James had hitherto been able to hold in check the power of the higher nobles, and to keep the country in something like tranquillity. But the murder of Moray, the im plication of the chancellor and suspected connivance of the king in this foul transaction ; the compulsory retirement of Maitland, and the formidable combina tion which had taken place between the majority of 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Hudson to Burghley, 7th December, 1591."], [190, "1592. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 184 the higher nobles and the Earl of Bothwell, threw the monarch into alarm, and forced him upon some measures which, under other circumstances, he would scarcely have adopted. His late favour to Huntley had damaged him in the affections of the Kirk : he now resolved to court its aid and to flatter it by un wonted concessions. These it is important to notice, as they led to no less a measure than the establish ment of Presbytery by a prince to whom this form of ecclesiastical government appears to have been espe cially obnoxious. The acts passed in the parliament 158.4, against the discipline and privileges of the Kirk, had loag been a thorn in the side of the ministers ; and they now, in an assembly held some time previous to the meeting of parliament, resolved to petition the king, not only for the abolition of these obnoxious statutes, but for a solemn legislative establishment of the Presbyterian system of church government. Accordingly, parliament having assembled in June 1592, the assembly presented the four following articles or requests to the king : \u2014 1. That the acts of parliament made in the year 1584, against the discipline and liberty of the Kirk, should be repealed, and the present discipline be ratified. 2. That the act of annexation should be abolished, and the patrimony of the Kirk restored. 3. That abbots, priors, and other prelates pretending to ecclesiastical authority, and giving their vote in matters without any delegated power from the Kirk, should not be hereafter permitted to vote in parlia ment or other convention : and lastly, 4. That the land, which was polluted by fearful idolatry and bloodshed, should be purged.1 1 Calderwood, pp. 267, 268."], [191, "1592. JAMES VI. 185 The first article, which went to rescind the acts of 1584, was long and keenly debated : for James was acute enough to detect the increased power which this must give to the ministers ; and it is certain that no change had taken place in the mind of the monarch as to the dangers to be apprehended from the turbu lence and independence of these bold and able men. The republican principles, the austere morality, and the extreme pulpit license of the Kirk, were wholly opposed to all his ideas of ecclesiastical polity or civil government ; but Maitland, who had now resumed his influence, though still absent from court, was solicitous to conciliate the friends of the murdered Moray, and to appease the people ; and assisting the Kirk at this moment with the full weight of his in fluence and advice, the king, more from policy than affection, assented to the proposal. An act, accor dingly, was passed, which is still regarded as the \" Charter of the liberties of the Kirk.\" It ratified its system of government by general assemblies, provincial synods, presbyteries, and par ticular sessions. It affirmed such courts, with the jurisdiction and discipline belonging to them, to be just, good, and godly ; defined their powers ; appointed the time and manner of their meeting ; and declared that the acts passed in 1584 should be in no ways prejudicial to the privileges of the office-bearers in the Kirk in determining heads of religion, matters of heresy, questions of excommunication, appointment and deprivation of ministers ; that another act of the same parliament, granting commissions to bishops to receive the royal presentations to bishoprics, and to give collation, should be rescinded ; and that all pre sentations should be directed to their particular pres byteries, with full power to give collation and decide"], [192, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1592. 186 all ecclesiastical causes within their bounds, under the proviso that they admitted such ministers as were presented by the king or other lay patrons.1 Had the Kirk contented itself with these triumphs, and rested satisfied in the king's present dispositions, which appeared wholly in its favour, all things might have remained quiet : for the Catholics, convinced of the madness of their projects, were ready to abstain from all practices inimical to the religion of the state, on the single condition that they should not be perse cuted for their adherence to the ancient faith. But the Kirk were not disposed to take this quiet course. The principle of toleration, divine as it assuredly is in its origin, yet so late in its recognition even amongst the best men, was then utterly unknown to either party, Reformed or Catholic. The permission even of a single case of Catholic worship, however secret ; the attendance of a solitary individual at a single mass, in the remotest district of the land, at the dead hour of night, in the most secluded chamber, and where none could come but such as knelt before the altar for conscience' sake, and in all sincerity of soul ; such worship, aud its permission for an hour, was considered an open encouragement of Antichrist and idolatry. To extinguish the mass for ever, to compel its supporters to embrace what the Kirk con sidered to be the purity of Presbyterian truth, and this under the penalties of life and limb, or in its mildest form of treason, banishment, and forfeiture, was considered not merely praiseworthy, but a point of high religious duty ; and the whole apparatus of the Kirk, the whole inquisitorial machinery of - M'Crie's Life of Melvil, p. 403.

JAMES VI. 187 detection and persecution, was brought to bear upon the accomplishment of these great ends. Are we to wonder that, under such a state of things, the intrigues of the Catholics for the overthrow of a government which sanctioned such a system continued ; that when they knew, or suspected, that the king himself was averse to persecution, they were encouraged to renew their intercourse with Spain ; and to hope that a new outbreak, if properly directed, might lead either to the destruction of a rival faith, or to the establishment of liberty of conscience ? A discovery which occurred at this time corrobo rates these remarks, and drew after it important con sequences. The Kirk, in the course of its inquisitions, in which it was assisted by Sir Robert Bowes, the resident English ambassador, received certain infor mation that George Kerr, a Catholic gentleman, and brother of the Abbot of Newbottle,1 was secretly passing into Spain with important letters. Upon this, Mr. Andrew Kuox, minister of Paisley, setting off with a body of armed men furnished by Lord Ross, traced Kerr to Glasgow, and thence to the little isles of the Cumrays in the mouth of the Clyde, where they seized him in the night, imme diately after he had got on board the ship which was to carry him to the continent. His luggage was then searched, the packets of letters found, and he himself hurried a prisoner to Edinburgh ; where the provost and the citizens, alarmed by the reports which had already reached them, received him with shouts of triumph and execration.

This army was to be joined by the Earls of Huntley, Errol, and Angus, with Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, uncle to Huntley, and other Catholic barons. Amongst the letters seized, and which appeared to be written by Scottish Jesuits and seminary priests to their brethren on the continent, there were found several signatures of the Earls of Huntley, Errol, and Angus. These were written at the bottom of blank sheets of paper, with the seals of these noblemen attached to them ; from wdiich circumstance the plot received the name of the \" Spanish Blanks.\" It was at first suspected by Bowes, who was familiar with all the arcana of conspiracy, that the blanks were written over with ink of white vitriol, prepared ;2 but it turned out that they were to be filled up afterwards by Kerr, according to verbal instructions, and to be delivered to the King of Spain.3 It may well be imagined that this dis covery \u2014 serious enough, certainly, in its known fea tures, and around which there was that air of mystery which gave ample scope for all kinds of terror and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 6th February, 1592-3.

Sir John Carmichael and Sir George Hume were sent to the king, who was at Stirling, to entreat his immediate presence. Angus, then at Edinburgh, and recently returned from an expedition to the north, was committed to the castle of Edin burgh ; and proclamation made that all Jesuits, seminary priests, and excommunicates, should, within three hours, depart the city on pain of death.1 A convention of the nobility and Protestant gentry was forthwith held, and, headed by the ministers, pre sented themselves at the palace, and insisted on the instant prosecution and punishment of the traitors ; declaring their readiness to hazard life and property in the service. The Queen of Scotland, and the powerful house of the Setons, earnestly interceded for Kerr,2 who in the end escaped ; but Graham of Fintry, found to be deeply implicated, was imprisoned ; and Angus's trial and forfeiture was considered so certain, that the courtiers, wolf-like, began to smell the prey ; and Sir George Hume wrote pressingly to Lord Hume, requiring him to come speedily to court that he might have his share in the spoils.3 James's conduct at this crisis was both wise and spirited. He had received information, much about the same time when the Spanish conspiracy came to light, that his traitorous subject Bothwell, who had twice invaded his palace and attempted to seize his person, was received in England and regarded with favour by Elizabeth. Now was the time, he felt, to 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, Jan. 3, 1592-3. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Jan. 13th, 1592-3. 3 Ibid.

He was well aware that this fierce and formidable insurgent was favoured secretly by the Kirk, and by many of those nobles who now insisted upon the instant pursuit of the Popish earls. He was aware, too, that Elizabeth's alarm on the discovery of the Spanish Blanks would prompt her to advise the most severe measures against the delinquents, and he ably availed himself of all this. To the Kirk and the Protestant barons he gave the most friendly reception ; spoke loudly of Angus's instant forfeiture ; and not only agreed to the pursuit of Huntley, Errol, and their associates, but declared that he would lead the army in person and seize them in their northern strongholds. Nor were these mere words. Huntley, Errol, and Auchendown, were com manded to enter themselves in ward at St. Andrews before the 5th February; public proclamation was made that all men should be ready, on the 25th of the same month, with armour and weapons, to march with the king in person against the traitors if they failed to deliver themselves ; and various committees were appointed for the examination of all suspected persons, belonging either to the nobility, barons, burgesses, or clergy.1 All this was most gratifying to the Kirk and the Protestant leaders amongst the nobility. But, in return for this, the king demanded as cordial a co operation on their side for the attack and destruction of Bothwell, whose treasons, though of a different nature, were even more flagrant than those of the Catholic earls ; and this they were not in a situation to refuse.

He had been familiar with all the plots of Bothwell, and looked upon them with no unfavourable eye, although he took care not directly to implicate himself. He had repeatedly applied to Burghley to receive instructions and understand the queen's wishes : but Elizabeth was too cautious to commit herself; whilst Bowes knew for certain that she encouraged Bothwell secretly, and expressed the highest scorn and contempt for Huntley and the Spanish faction, wdiom she branded as base traitors who had sold their country. On this subject Eliza beth, shortly before this,1 had sent a letter to James, part of which, relating to the Spanish faction, from its vigour, is worthy of preservation : \u2014 \" Advance not,\" said she, \" such as hang their hop-es on other strings than you may tune.

Mr. Lock, an agent of Burghley, and a near relative of the notorious in triguer, John Colvile, brother to the Laird of Easter Wemyss, had been sent down to Scotland with instructions to form a faction with the Kirk and the Protestant barons for Bothwell's restoration; and their plots had proceeded so far, that the attack upon the palace, which afterwards occurred in the autumn of this year, would probably have been enterprised sooner, but for the discovery of the Spanish Blanks.2 Of all these English intrigues James was now aware ; and when Bowes was admitted to an audience, the monarch broke into a violent passion.

Her subjects received and harboured him, and they pleaded her warrant to do so. If so, he must account it done to his scorn and dishonour. However, he should investigate the matter closely ; and should it turn out so, (this he said loudly, and in the hearing of many about him,) there was an end to his amity with the queen, and with every man in England. So unwonted a storm had never yet broken the serene tenor of James's temper ; and Bowes found it difficult to appease it even by the most earnest assu rances of Elizabeth's innocence.1 In a subsequent interview, however, he was somewhat more successful. The Queen of England despatched a letter written wholly in her own hand, in a strain of so much con ciliation, and fraught with so much sound advice, that the monarch was recovered ; showed the epistle, with many expressions of admiration, to his confidential counsellors and some of the chief ministers, and lis tened to their exhortations to proceed roundly against the Catholic lords. There were some difficulties, however, in the way. Huntley solemnly declared his innocence, and affirmed that the blanks were not signed by him. If he, Errol, and Angus, delivered themselves by the appointed day, .and were once secured in prison, there was little doubt of the issue ; but if, as suspected, they fled and raised their feudal strength, the king must march against them ; and, with an impoverished exchequer, who was to pay his troops ? Elizabeth's bounty, he said, had flowed in a far more niggard stream than had been promised. He had looked to have five thousand a-year, the sum allowed by Henry the Eighth to the queen herself 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 19th January, 1592-3. VOL. VII.

But to explain all more fully, he meant (as he assured Bowes) to send her an ambassador, Sir Robert Melvil, or some other confidential councillor.2 Meantime, before any such resolution could be acted on, Elizabeth's anxiety, and the alarming confessions of Kerr, prompted her to despatch Lord Burgh with a message to the king, and instructions to press on the trials of the Spanish lords by every possible method. What had been fully expected by all who knew these bold insurgents had now occurred. Instead of a sur render of their persons on the day appointed, Huntley, Errol, Auchendown, and their associates, kept them selves within their strongholds in the north. Angus escaped from the castle of Edinburgh, letting himself down the walls by a rope, and joined his friends in the Highlands ; and the king's council, with the higher nobles, became cold and inactive. But the monarch himself was roused by this opposition into unwonted energy. He alone had conducted the examination of Kerr, had advocated the use of torture against the advice of his ministers, and by this horrible expedient had extorted a confession. He now hurried forward the trial of Graham of Fintry, had him found guilty, and instantly executed; and having requested the prayers of the Kirk for success in his expedition, and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, January 27, 1592-3. \u25a0\u00bb Ibid."], [201, "1593.

After mentioning that Fintry had offered fifty thousand pounds Scots to save his life, the am bassador observes, \"the king in this hath remained resolute ; and alone, without the assistance of any of his council, prosecuted the cause. And now, he saith, that as alone he hath drawn his sword against his rebels, without the council's aid or allowance of his nobility, so he will proceed, with the help of God, to punish and prosecute the traitors in these high treasons, by all the means in his power ; and with the assistance of his barons, burghs, and Kirk, whom he findeth ready to aid him therein.

Strathbogie castle, belonging to Huntley, was given to Archibald Carmichael, with sixteen of the royal guard for a garrison ; but the Countess of Hunt ley, sister to the Duke of Lennox, was allowed to retain, for her winter residence, the Bog of Gicht, his greatest castle and estate. Athole received the rest of his lands, not in gift, but to hold them as steward or factor for the crown. Errol's father-in-law, the Earl Marshal, bought his son's escheat for a thousand marks, with the keeping of his castle of Slaines : his mother held his other house of Logie-Almond for her jointure; and Athole, whose sister he had married for his second wife, became factor of his other posses sions.

On the whole, however, the rebel lords, considering their crimes, were leniently dealt with. Their persons were safe in the fastnesses of Caithness ; their patrimonial in terest, and rights of succession, were considered to be still entire till an act of parliament had confirmed the forfeitures ; and part of their estates were placed in friendly hands. So evident was all this, that Lord Burgh wrote to Burghley, that the king \" dissembled a confiscation,\" and would leave the rebels in full strength.1 On his return from his northern expedition, James gave audience to Lord Burgh, and expressed himself gratified by the message and advice of Elizabeth. It was her interest, he said, to co-operate heartily with him in all his present actions, and assist him to her utmost. Was she not as deeply concerned to hinder the Spaniard setting his foot in Scotland as in France or the Low Countries ? At this moment money was imperatively called for ; an armed force of large extent must be kept up ; he needed troops to guard his per son, exposed to hourly danger from the plots of his nobles, and the snares of the arch-traitor Bothwell, with whose daring character she was too well ac quainted : \u2014 he needed them to overawe the districts still favourable to the Catholic lords ; to garrison then houses, which, according to his good sister's advice, he had seized ; to watch the coast where the Spaniards were likeliest to land : to repulse them, if they effected a descent. The cause was common to both ; and he looked not only for sympathy and counsel, but for hard coin and brave men. On one point he assured 1 MS. letter, State- paper Office, Lord Burgh to Burghley, March 5, 1592-3."], [204, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1593. 198 Burgh, that the message which he took back must be peremptory. \" Bothwell,\" said he, \" that vile traitor, whose offences against me are unpardonable, and such as, for example's sake, should make him to be abhorred by all sovereign princes, is harboured in England: let my sister expel him, or deliver him up, as she tenders her own honour and my contentment. Should he henceforth be consorted or concealed in her dominions, I must roundly assure her, not only that our amity is at an end, but that I shall be enforced to join in friend ship with her greatest enemies for my own safety.\" x This spirited remonstrance was not out of place ; for at this moment Elizabeth, pursuing her old policy of weakening Scotland, by destroying its tranquillity and keeping up its internal commotions, was encour aging Bothwell to a new and more desperate attempt against the king and his government. Lord Burgh had received secret instructions to entertain this fierce and lawless man. To discover his strength and means, and to increase his faction at court and with the minis ters of the Kirk, was the secret part of this ambas sador's mission ; and when James expressed to Bowes his admiration of the eloquence, grace, and courtly manners, of this nobleman, he little knew the hidden mine which he was digging under his feet. Yet so it was. Bothwell had offered his services to the English queen ; had written to Lord Burghley ; had received an answer of encouragement, though cautiously worded ; and had been ordered by the high treasurer to write secretly to the queen.2 It will immediately appear 1 Answers for the Lord Burgh, concerning Bothwell.

Meanwhile, the various factions and family feuds amongst the nobility had increased to such a degree, that the whole cares of the government fell upon the monarch ; and James, naturally indolent and fond of his pastimes, began to languish for the return of the Chancellor Maitland. This powerful minister had been driven from court by the antipathy of the Queen of Scots, the Duke of Lennox, and the whole faction of the Stewarts, who held him as their mortal enemy, and had repeatedly plotted against his life. The exact cause of the queen's \" heavy wrath \" against Maitland, appears to have been a mystery alike to the king and to Bowes ; but it was deeply rooted, and nearly touched her honour. He was at deadly feud also with the Master of Glammis, and hated by Bothwell, who regarded him as the author of all his calamities, and the forger of that accusation of witchcraft, under the imputation of which he was now a banished and broken man. It was difficult for the king to recall to power a minister who lay under such a load of en mity ; and, for the present, he was contented to visit him in his retreat at Lethington, and consult him upon the affairs of government.1 All, however, looked to his probable restoration to power ; and the bare idea of it occasioned the utmost jealousy and heart burning in court.

Argyle, Ochiltree, and all the barons who adhered to them, were at feud with Lord Thirl stane the chancellor, Lord Hume, Lord Fleming, and their faction and allies ; in which course they were urged forward by the enmity of the Queen of Scots.2 It is difficult, by any general expressions, to convey a picture of the miserable state of a country torn by such feuds as these. Nor were these the sole causes of disquiet : Huntley, Angus, and Errol, although declared traitors, were at large in the north ; Both well, whom the king justly regarded as his mortal enemy, was also at liberty, harboured sometimes on the borders, sometimes in England, and even daring to enter the capital in disguise and hold secret inter course with the noblemen about the king's person. The intrigues of the Catholics, although checked by the late discoveries, were not at an end ; and the mini sters of the Kirk, utterly dissatisfied with the leniency which James had exhibited to the rebel earls, beo-an to attack his conduct in the pulpit, and to throw out surmises of his secret inclinations to Popery.

The sole party on whom he could depend was that of the ministers of the Kirk, with the lesser barons and the burghs ; ] and their support was only to be bought at the price of the utter destruction of the Catholic earls, and the entire extir pation of the Catholic faith. To this sweeping act of persecution the monarch would not consent. At this moment thirteen of the nobility of Scotland were Catholics ;2 and in the north ern counties a large proportion of the people were attached to the same faith. It was insisted on, by the leading ministers of the Kirk, in a convention of the estates which the king summoned at this time,3 that the strictest investigation should be made for the dis covery and imprisonment of all suspected of heresy ; and that, under the penalties of forfeiture and banish ment, they should be compelled to recant, and embrace the reformed religion. The severity and intolerance of such demands will be best understood by quoting the words of the original. The Kirk represented that, \" Seeing the increase of Papistry daily within this realm,\" it was craved of his majesty, with his council and nobility at that time assembled, \" that all Papists within the same may be punished according to the laws of God and of the realm. That the act of parliament might strike upon all manner of men, landed or un landed, in office or not, as it at present strikes against beneficed persons.

That all such persons as the Kirk had found to be Papists, although they be not excommunicated, should be debarred from occupying any office within the realm, as also from access to his majesty's company, or enjoying any benefit of the laws. That upon this declaration, the pains of treason and other civil pains should follow, as upon the sentence of excommunica tion ; and that an act of council should be passed to this effect, which in the next parliament should be made law.\" If the king agreed to these demands, the convention promised, for their part, that \" their bodies, goods, friends, allies, servants, and possessions, should be wholly at his service, in any way he was pleased to employ them.\" During the whole pursuit of this cause, (the utter destruction of all Papistry within the realm,) they declared, that not only their whole numbers should be, at all times, a guard to the royal person, but that the king might select from them any force he pleased as a daily body-guard ; the pay of which, however, they prudently added, ought to be levied from the possessions of the Catholics ; and if this were not enough, they would themselves make up the difference.1 To these sweeping and severe penalties, James wrould by no means consent ; and the Kirk, irritated by his re fusal, withdrew that assistance and co-operation which it had hitherto lent him in preserving peace and good 1 MS.

In stead of the happy tranquillity which had reigned during his absence in Denmark, and which he had mainly ascribed to the efforts of the ministers, the capital, as the time of the parliament approached, pre sented almost daily scenes of outrage and confusion. The security and sanctity of domestic life were invaded and despised ; ruffians under the command of, and openlyprotected by the nobles, tore honourable maidens from the bosom of their families, and carried them off in open day. James Gray, a brother of the notorious Master of Gray, seized a young lady named Carnegie, an heiress, and then living under her father's roof; carried her forcibly down a narrow close, or street, to the North Loch, a lake which then surrounded the castle ; delivered her to a party of armed men, who dragged her into a boat, her hair hanging about her face, and her clothes almost torn from her person ; whilst Gray's associate, Lord Hume, kept the streets with his retainers, beat off the provost, who attempted a rescue, and slew some of the citizens, who had pre sumed to interfere. Next day the chief magistrate carried his complaint in person before the king. \" Do you see here any of my nobles whom you can accuse ? \" said James. At that moment Hume was standing beside James ; but when the unhappy provost encoun tered his fierce eye, the impeachment stuck in his throat from terror, and he retired silent and abashed.1 The outrap-e was the more shameful, as Grav was a gentleman of the king's household, and had been assisted by Sir James Sandilands and other courtiers; whilst the Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Mar were play ing tennis hard by, and abstained from all interference. 1 MS.

Captain James Stewart, once the formidable and haughty Earl of Arran, had been seen lately in the palace. It was known he had been favourably received by James in several secret interviews ; the queen and the duke were his friends ; his misfortunes had neither tamed his pride, nor quelled that fierce energy and unscrupulous daring which had prompted him to destroy the Regent Morton ; and at this crisis, when all were anticipating the return of the chancellor to power, it was suspected that the enemies of Maitland had determined to recall Stewart, and employ him for the destruction of this minister.2 He had already pulled down one far mightier from his palmy state : what, said the queen and Lennox, was to prevent him from being successful against another ? Amid these complicated distresses James had scarcely one counsellor on whom he could rely. With his capital bristling with steel-clad barons, each feeling himself superior to the throne or the law ; the streets in possession of tumultuous bodies of retainers and feudal banditti, armed to the teeth, and commanded by men at mortal feud with each other ; his court and palace divided by the intrigues of the several rival factions ; diffident even of the gentlemen who waited on his person ; distracted by 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 17th June, 1 593. 2 Ibid. 20th June, 1593."], [212, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1593. 206 reports that troopers had been seen hovering in the neighbourhood, completely armed and disguised ;\u25a0 de serted for the time by the Kirk ; uncertain as yet of the success of the embassy of Sir Robert Melvil, whom he had lately sent to Elizabeth ; and tormented by hourly reports of undefined but urgent dangers and mysterious conspiracies, \u2014 the wonder is, that a prince of James's indolent and timid temper should not have sunk under such a state of things. But the emergency seemed to rouse him; and by an unusual exertion of firmness and good sense, he succeeded in warding off the dangers, persuaded the barons to dismiss their followers, and brought about a recon ciliation between the queen's faction, led by the duke, and their powerful enemy the Chancellor Maitland. It had long been evident to the king that, in the pre sent state of the country, no hand but that of Maitland could save the government from absolute wreck and disruption ; and it was agreed, that on the conclusion of the parliament, which was now on the eve of meeting, this minister should return to court, and be reinstated in his high office.2 Scarce, however, was this danger averted than the city was thrown into a new state of excitement by the shrieks and lamentations of a troop of miserable women, who had travelled from the borders, the victims and survivors of a recent \" raid\" conducted by the Laird of Johnston. Their purpose was to throw themselves before the king, and demand justice for the slaughter of their sons and husbands, whose bloody shirts they held above their heads, exhibiting them to the people as they marched through the 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, June 19, 1593. 2 Ibid.

It was a sight which, in any other country, might well have roused both pity and indignation ; but though the people murmured, the ghastly proces sion passed on without further notice, and neither king nor noble condescended to interfere.1 The parliament now assembled ; but its proceedings were delayed by a quarrel between the higher nobles for the precedency in bearing the honours. At length it was arranged that Lennox should carry the crown, Argyle the sceptre, and Morton the sword ; and that, in the absence of the Chancellor Maitland, Alexander Seton, president of the Session, should fill his place, and conduct the proceedings.2 Bothwell was then proclaimed a traitor at the Cross ; and the queen's jointure, which had been settled at her marriage, and regarding which some difficulties had arisen, was con firmed. To conciliate the Kirk, an act was passed exempting ministers' stipends from taxation ; another statute was introduced against the Mass ; and a strict inquisition ordered to be made for all Papists and seminary priests : but on the great subject for which it was understood parliament had met, the prosecu tion and forfeiture of the Popish earls, the party of the Kirk were miserably disappointed, or rather, all their gloomiest expectations were fulfilled. Huntley, Errol, Angus, and Auchendown, escaped forfeiture. It had been secretly resolved by the king, that no extreme proceedings should be adopted against these noblemen, who had a numerous and powerful party on their side,3 till Sir Robert Melvil, then at the 1 MS.

Mr. David Makgill, the king's advocate, a man of extra ordinary talent, but who had often opposed the Kirk, declared that the summonses were informal, the evi dence of traitorous designs and correspondence with Spain insufficient ; and that it was impossible for any act of attainder to pass in the present meeting of the estates.1 This for the time settled the matter : but the Kirk were deeply indignant ; and their champion, Mr. John Davison, denounced the proceedings, and attacked the sovereign in the pulpit on the Sunday which suc ceeded their close. \" It was a black parliament,\" he said ; \" for iniquity was seated in the high court of justice, and had trodden equity under foot. It was a black parliament, for the arch-traitors had escaped ; escaped, did he say ! no : they were absolved ; and now all good men might prepare themselves for darker days : trials were at hand : it had ever been seen that the absolving of the wicked imported the persecution of the righteous. Let us pray,\" said he, in conclu sion, \" that the king, by some sanctified plagues, may be turned again to God.\"2 Such plagues as Davison thus prayed for, were nearer at hand than many imagined ; for Elizabeth, according to her favourite policy, had more than one plot now carrying forward in Scotland. Her accredited ambassador, Sir Robert Bowes, was indeed instructed to keep \\p the most friendly assurances, and to pro- 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, D. II.

To this plot the Duke of Lennox, the Earl of Mar, the Earl of Athole, Lord Ochiltree, and the whole noblemen and barons of the name and race of Stewart, were parties ; and they chose this meeting of the three estates, wdien the king was surrounded by many of their faction, to carry their purpose into execution. The parliament was now about to terminate, when, on the night of the 23d of July, Bothwell was secretly conveyed into the house of Lady Gowrie, which adjoined the palace of Holyrood. This lady's daughter was the Countess of Athole, to whose courage and ingenuity the success of the plot was principally owing. Early in the morning of the 24th of July, she smuggled Bothwell and Mr. John Colvile, by a back passage, into the ante-room adjoining the king's bed chamber, hid them behind the arras, removed the weapons of the guard, and locked the door of the queen's bedchamber, through which the king might have escaped. The gates of the palace were then occupied by the Duke and Athole, who placed a guard upon them. All this time James was asleep ; but he awoke at nine, and calling for one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber, got up and threw 1 MS. State-paper Office, B.C. John Carey to Burghley, August 1 , 1593.

An alarm now suddenly rose in the next room ; and the king rushing out with his hose about his heels, and his under-garments in his hands, confronted Bothwell, who had glided from behind the hangings, and stood with his drawn sword in his hand, Colvile being beside him. James shouted \" Treason !\" and ran to the door of the queen's bed room ; but it was found locked ; and nothing remained but to face his enemy, which, when driven to it, he did with unwonted spirit, and his usual voluble elo quence. \" Come on,\" said he, \" Francis : you seek my life, and I know I am wholly in your power. Take your king's life : I am ready to die. Better to die with honour than live in captivity and shame. Nay, kneel not man,\" he continued, (by this time the Duke of Lennox and Athole had come in, and Both well and Colvile had thrown themselves on their knees ;) \" kneel not, and add hypocrisy to treason. You protest, forsooth, you only come to sue for par don, to submit yourself to your trial for witchcraft, to be cleansed by your peers of the foul imputations which lie heavy on you.

Am I not your anointed king, twenty-seven years old, and no longer a boy or a minor, when every faction could make me their property ? But you have plotted my death, and I call upon you now to execute your pur pose : for I will not live a prisoner and dishonoured.\" As he said this, the king sat calmly down, as if pre pared for the worst ; but Bothwell, still on his knees, loudly disclaimed all such murderous intentions, and kissing the hilt of his sword, took it by the point, delivered it to his sovereign, and placing his head"], [217, "1593. JAMES VI. 211 beneath James's foot, bared his neck of its long tresses, (then the fashion of the young gallants of the day,) and called upon him to strike it off if he believed that he ever harboured a thought against his royal person.1 The Duke of Lennox, Athole, and Ochiltree, now vehemently interceded for the earl ; and James, rais ing him from the ground, retired into a window recess to talk apart, when an uproar arose below in the streets, and the citizens of Edinburgh, who had heard a rumour of the enterprise, rushed tumultuously into the palace-yard, headed by their provost, Alexander Hume, who loudly called to the king, then standing at the open casement, that, on a single word from him, they would force the doors and rid him of the traitors about him. James, however, who dreaded to be slain, or torn in pieces, if the two factions came to blows, commanded the citizens to disperse ; and taking re fuge in that dissimulation of which he was so great a master, pretended to be reconciled to Bothwell, fixed a near day for his trial, and simply stipulated that, till he was acquitted, he should retire from court. To all this the earl agreed. Next day his peace was proclaimed, by the heralds, at the Cross. The people, of whom he was a great favourite, crowded round him ; and not only his own faction, which was very strong, but the ministers of the Kirk, showed them selves highly gratified at his return.2 Having settled this, Bothwell left the capital ; and attended only by two servants, rode to Berwick, where he had an interview with Mr. John Carey, the son of Lord Hunsdon, and governor of that border town ; 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, August 18, 1593.

All was in vain, however. The Scottish earl settled himself on the venerable dignitary, and \" put ting him to silence,\" ran over the story of his whole courses, and ended with his late seizure of the king. Mathews, who had no mind to be made a party in such violent matters, did not permit his eyelids to slumber till he had written an account of it all to Burghley. His letter, which is dated at midnight, on the 2d August, gives us an excellent account of the interview. \" This day,\" says he, \" about three of the clock after noon, came hither to my house the Earl Bothwell, thereunto moved, as he protested, as well by some good opinion of me conceived, as for that he under stands I am one of her majesty's council established in the north. * * And albeit I was very loath to enter into any speech of the Scottish affairs, espe cially of state, wishing him to write thereof to your lordship, or to the lord president ; or, if he so thought good, to negotiate his business with her majesty's * MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

' Well done once, my lord,' quoth I, ' is double well said ; ' which word, although he took somewhat displeasantly, yet did it occasion him to affirm and confirm the same, over and over again, so far as possibly may stand with the amity of both the princes, and the perpetual conservation of religion now openly professed both in England and Scotland. \" Then began he to discourse the manner and means of his late enterprise, and entrance to the king's pre sence ; * * which, to mine understanding, was a plain surprise of the king in his bedchamber, made by the earl and another gentleman, in the sight of the duke, the Earls of Mar and Athole, with others his friends purposely assembled : his sword in his hand, drawn ; the king fearfully offering to withdraw him self into the queen's chamber, which before was devised to be kept shut against him. Howbeit, as upon short conference between the king and the earl a little apart, they soon grew to an accord. * * So he confessed to me, that, immediately after this pacification, the king used all means, rough and smooth, to sound and"], [220, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1593. 214 pierce him thoroughly : what favours have been done him; what sums of money sent him; what promises made him ; what advice or direction given him from her majesty or council, or other English, to get access in court to possess the king. Whereunto the earl made answer by utter denial, saving that her highness had a princely commiseration of his distressed estate, so far only as to yield him to take the benefit of the air of her country for preservation of his liberty and life, so narrowly sought by the king ; so directly and cruelly by his adversaries. * * The king, with marvellous vehemency, insisted long upon that point, and eftsoons conjured him, 'by all the faith he bare him, by all the allegiance he owed him, by all the love he professed to him, by all the favour he hoped for ever to find of him, that he should not conceal Eliza beth's dealings from him; being,' as he said, 'a mat ter so manifest.' But,\" continued Dr. Toby to Burgh ley, \"the more violently the king sought to sift him, the more resolute was the earl, not only peremptorily to disclaim every particular thereof, but in sort, as he could, to charge the king with much unkindness and unthankf ulness causelessly to carry such jealousy and suspicion of her majesty, who had hitherto been so gracious a lady, yea, a very mother unto him ; and, under the providence of God, the only supporter of his estate that ever he found, or is like to find upon earth.

Meanwhile, the royal captive had not been idle. Although surrounded by his enemies and strictly watched, he contrived to receive messages from Hunt ley, who was mustering a large force in the north ; and secretly communicated with Lord Hume and the Master of Glammis on the best way of making his escape. He was assisted in this by three gentlemen of the house of Erskine, who had been permitted to remain about his person. They employed two others of his attendants, named Lesley and Ogilvy; and it was resolved that a rescue should be attempted im mediately after the trial of Bothwell, when the king was to pass over the Forth from Holyrood to Falk land. A fleet horse was to be ready at the park gate ; James, eluding his guards, was to mount and gallop to Lochleven; whilst Hume, with all his forces, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Earl of Bothwell to the Queen.

JAMES VI. 219 making an onset on the opposite faction, who had been assembled for the trial in the capital, hoped either to seize their leaders or put them to death.1 All these preparations were managed by the king with such accomplished dissimulation, that he completely blinded Bothwell and his associates. The trial now came on, and lasted from one in the forenoon till ten at night. In the indictment the earl was accused, on the evidence of several depositions made by Richard Graham, who had been burnt for witchcraft, of three several attempts against the king's life and estate : one by poison ; another by fabricat ing a waxen image in the likeness of the monarch ; and the last, by enchantments to prevent his ever returning out of Denmark. The poison was com pounded, according to the declaration of the wizard, of adders' skins, toads' skins, and the hippomanes in the head of a young foal ; and was to be placed where it might ooze down upon the king's head where he usually sat, a single drop being of such devilish and pestilent strength as to cause instant death. The defence of the earl was conducted by Craig the famous feudal lawyer, who contended that Graham's various depositions were not only inconsistent and contradictory in themselves, but refuted by the decla rations of his miserable sisters in sorcery, Sampson, Macalzean, and Napier ; whilst he proved, by unex ceptionable evidence, that Graham had been induced to accuse Bothwell under a promise of pardon signed by the king's counsel, and from the terror of being tortured. The earl also defended himself with much spirit and eloquence, and the result was his triumphant acquittal ; which, considering the strength of his party 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, August 11, 1593."], [226, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1593. 220 at this moment, would probably have been the issue had he been as guilty as he really appears to have been innocent.1 All this took place on the 10th. On the 11th, the plot laid for the king's escape was to be carried into effect ; and at three in the morning of that day, every thing was in readiness. William Lesley, one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber, carrying with him the king's ring and a letter for Lord Hume, was passing as silently as he could through the court yard ; when Bothwell, who slept in the palace, was awakened by the watch, who suspected some secret practice, and rushing down seized the messenger, found on his person the king's letter and signet, and discovered the whole. The rest of the gentlemen were then arrested and delivered to the guard ; and the earl, repairing to the king, who was by this time making ready to take horse, interdicted the journey, and charged him with his breach of promise. A stormy interview ensued. James insisted that he would ride to Falkland : Bothwell assured him that he should not leave the palace till the country was more settled. \" You and your fellows,\" said James, \" have broken your promises, imprisoned my servants, and now think to hold me a captive. Where are the three Erskines ? where is Gilbert Ogilvy ? where the faithful Lesley ? Did ye not swear that I should return, after the trial, to Falkland ; and that you, Bothwell, should withdraw from my company as soon as you were cleared by an assize?\" \u2014 \"And so we shall,\" replied the earl. \" But first, my liege, we must be relaxed from the horn, restored to our lands and offices, and see the foul murder of the Earl of Moray 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

With matchless effrontery he declared his mistress's astonishment at the enterprise of Bothwell ; regretted the facility with which so treasonable an in vasion had been pardoned ; and expressed her anxiety for the safety of the king's person, and the preservation of the country from rebellion. James answered, that it was not for him to answer for the enterprise of Bothwell. He was no accomplice, but its victim ; and for the traitors who now kept him, they had for sworn themselves, and broken every promise. Was he not prevented from free access to his own palace of Falkland ? Had they not imprisoned five of his servants, and demanded the trial of the chancellor, the Master of Glammis, and Sir George Hume ? and when he asked why, insolently answered, that they might be hanged.2 But let them look to themselves. He might seem in a helpless state ; but he was their 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 16th August, 1593. 2 Ibid-"], [228, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1593. 222 king: and sooner would he suffer his hand to be cut from his wrist than sign any letter of remission at their imperious bidding ; sooner endure the extremity of death, than consent to live a captive, and in dis honour. Bowes assured him of his mistress's sym pathy; advised an amicable settlement ; and at last, after two days' labour, with the assistance of some mediators selected from the ministers, the judges of the Session, and the chief magistrates of the city, succeeded in bringing the parties to an agreement. During the whole of these conferences, the king appears to have behaved with such unwonted spirit and resolution, that it is evident he must have been assured of a large party, and of near and speedy succour. He declared, in sharp terms, to the mini sters of the Kirk, that he would either be once more a free monarch, and released from these traitors, or proclaim himself a captive : and he charged them, on their allegiance, to let his mind be known to his people ; to exhort them to procure his delivery by force; and to assure them he would hazard his life to attain it.1 When Athole proposed himself to be appointed lieutenant-governor in the north, with full power against Huntley, and Bothwell claimed the same high office in the south, James, almost with contempt, refused both the one and the other ; but he consented to pardon Bothwell and his associates, for all his attempts against his person \u2022 and agreed that Lord Hume, the Chancellor Maitland, the Master of Glaminis, and Sir George Hume, should not repair to court till the conclusion of the parliament, which was to meet within a month or six weeks at Stirlino-.2 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, August 16, 1 593. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office.

In the late revolution James had exhibited unusual firmness ; and this last compromise with BothwTell was almost a victory. Nor was he deceived in his expec tations of still farther triumph over this insolent noble, whom he now justly regarded as the leader of the English party and of the Kirk. The resolution and courage which the king had exhibited, convinced his turbulent barons that he was no longer a minor, or a puppet, to be tossed about from faction to faction, and made the helpless and passive instrument of their ambition. Many of them, therefore, began to attach themselves to the royal faction, from self-interest rather than loyalty ; and however fatal to the peace of the country, the deadly feuds which existed amongst the nobles, by preventing combination, formed the strength of the monarch at this moment. It was evident that Bothwell had either deceived Elizabeth or himself, when he spoke to Carey and Mathews of his overwhelming strength, and the facility with which"], [231, "1593. JAMES VI. 225 he could guide the government of Scotland according to the wishes of his renowmed empress. Already his ally, the Duke of Lennox, young, capricious, and a favourite of James, began to waver ; and before the appointed convention met at Stirling on the 9th of September, a powerful reaction had taken place, which no efforts of English intrigue could arrest. It was in vain that Elizabeth, Burghley, and Sir Robert Cecil his son, who now acted as a chief counsellor in all \" Scottish causes,\" exerted themselves to keep up a faction, and even entered into a secret communication with Huntley and the Popish party, in the vain hope of bringing about a coalition between them and Both well. The effort to join with the Roman Catholics, whom they had so often stigmatized as enemies to the truth, only served to show the fraud and falsehood of Elizabeth's and Cecil's constantly repeated assertion, that they were guided solely by zeal for the glory of God and the interests of the true religion ; and Bowes the ambassador assured them, that if the plot for this unnatural combination went forward, the ministers of the Kirk, from whom it could not be concealed, would \" greatly start and wonder hereat.\" l Besides, how 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 6th Sept. 1503.

How could he allow Huutley's uncle, a priest and a Jesuit, to steal quietly out of Scotland, and yet satisfy the Kirk and the Protestant leaders, that he (Bowes) was an enemy to the idolaters ? All this needed to be reconciled and explained ; and he begged for speedy directions.1 We have seen how completely Bothwell had been supported and encouraged in his late audacious and treasonable enterprises by the English queen. He was now to feel the fickleness of her favour : and with that deep hypocrisy which so often marked her politi cal conduct, she addressed a letter to the King of Scots, and instructions to Bowes, in which she stig matized the Scottish earl as guilty of an abominable fact, which moved her utmost abhorrence ; and ex pressed her unfeigned astonishment, that any subject who had acted thus insolently, had not only escaped without chastisement, but had received, as it appeared, a remission of such atrocious conduct. She alluded also, with scorn and indignation, to his refusal to pro secute those \" notable traitors of the north,\" Huntley, Errol, and Angus, \" who had conspired among them selves, and agreed to admit great forces of strangers to enter into his realm, to the ruin of his estate and the subversion of religion ;\" and she warned him that such sudden changes as had been brought to her ears, his trust and secrecy ; and I believe, verily, that his partners binding up with Argomartes [Bothwell,] shall acquaint him therewith.

JAMES VI. 227 such capriciousness and imbecility of judgment, would end not only in the loss of his liberty, but might endanger his life.1 It did not suit James's policy or circumstances to tear the veil from these pretences at this moment ; and, indeed, we are not certain that, however he may have suspected Elizabeth's double dealing, he had detected it with any thing of the cer tainty with which we can now unravel her complicated intrigues. At all events, he chose to fight her with her own crafty weapons, and pretended to Bowes that he was fully satisfied with her late assurances of friend ship. When the appointed convention assembled at Stirling, Bothwell was commanded to absent himself from court until the meeting of parliament, which was fixed for the 14th of November ; at which time the king intimated his intention of granting him a full pardon and restitution to his estates and honours, upon his submitting himself to the royal mercy.2 He was then to leave the realm, but enjoy his revenues in his banishment ; and his accomplices in his late treasons were to be pardoned. Such terms, with which the rebel earl was com pelled to be contented, exhibited a wonderful and rapid change in the power of the king ; and all per ceived where James's strength lay, when Lord Hume, Avith the Master of Glammis, and Sir George Hume of Primrose Knowe, entered Stirling during the con vention at the head of a large force. Every thing was now changed, and the king spoke boldly out. He declared his resolution to cancel any promises extorted by force, when he was a captive ; but pro- 1 MS.

He received Hume and his associates with open arms ; sent for the Countess of Huntley to court ; permitted the Catholic earls, Angus and Errol, to visit their friends without molestation ; and, it was strongly reported, had consented to have a secret interview with Huntley at Falkland.1 This northern earl had recently received great promises from Spain ; and for the last eight months had maintained a large force, with which he had repeatedly ravaged the territories of his enemy Argyle, and kept the whole of that country in terror and subjection. This con stant exercise in war upon a larger scale than was commonly practised in Highland inroads, had made him an experienced soldier; and James felt that, with such leaders as Huntley and Hume, he need not dread Bothwell, Athole, or their allies. All this rendered the king formidable ; and soon after his triumph became complete by the arrival of his old and experienced councillor, the Chancellor Maitland, who, having been reconciled to the queen, the Master of Glammis, the Duke of Lennox, and his other enemies, rode to court, accompanied by young Cessford and two hundred horse.2 Measures now followed rapidly, of such a character as convinced the friends of England, the ministers of the Kirk, and the relics of Bothwell's party, that the king had not forgotten the late insults which had been offered him, and was preparing to take an ample revenge.

It was re marked, too, that the three Catholic earls, although still excluded from court, carried themselves with unwonted bravery and confidence. Angus, visiting Morton at the Newhouse in Fife, assured him that he had better join them in time, as their increasing strength would soon compel a union; and George Kerr, the victim of the Spanish Blanks, who had not been heard of since his escape from Edinburgh castle, suddenly showed himself at Melvil, near Dalkeith, with a troop of eighty horse, and warned the tenants of Lord Ross to cease from their labour, if they would not have their houses burned above their heads. It will be remembered that Ross's men had assisted in the capture of Kerr ; and their master, as was usual in those days, had been rewarded by a grant of Melvil, and other lands round Newbottle belonging to the Kerrs. These were trifling events ; but noted at the time in the pulpit, when the watchmen of the Kirk were keenly detecting how the current of court favour was setting in towards Popery.2 There is no good ground for suspecting, notwith standing the strong asseverations of the ministers to the contrary, that the King of Scots had ever any serious intentions of becoming a convert to the Roman 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, Sept. 13, 1593 2 Ibid. 6th October, 1593.

That such was his present object is evident from a passage in a letter of Mr. Carey the governor of Berwick, son of Lord Hunsdon, to Lord Burghley ; and the fervent hope expressed by this English baron, that the day may never arrive which shall see the Scottish nobles \" linked together in peace,\" is full of meaning. \" For the news in Scot land,\" says he, \" 1 know not well what to say ; but this I am sure, \u2014 the king doth too much oppose1 him self to the Papist faction for our good, I fear. Yet here [he means in the border districts] is nothing but peace and seeking to link all the nobility together, which I hope will never be. The Papists do only bear sway ; and the king hath none to put in trust with his own body but them. What will come of this your lordship's wisdom can best discern ; and thus much I know certain, that it were good your lordship looked well whom you trust : for the king and the nobility of Scotland have too good intelligence out of our court of England.\" 2 In prosecution of this design of a general union amongst his divided nobility, James opposed himself 1 \" Appose,\" {ad-pono, or appono,) place himself beside ; assimilate himself to the faction. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

He knew the truth of what Bothwell had lately stated to Elizabeth, that the Scottish Catholics were so strong, that, in the event of any attempt to unite them with the Protestants, they would soon rule all.1 Since then, Huntley and his friends had been daily gaining complete pre-eminence in the north ; and to render such a party furious or desperate by processes of treason and proscription ; to discharge against them, if they did not choose at once to renounce their religion and sign the Presbyterian Confession of Faith, the sharpest arrows of civil and ecclesiastical vengeance, would have been the extremity of intolerance and of folly. The king wisely declined this, and persevered in his course ; although the Presbyterian pulpits immediately opened their fire, and the provincial assembly of Fife was convened at St. Andrews to consult on the imminent dangers which surrounded the Kirk.2 Of this religious convention Mr. James Melvil, nephew of the well-known Andrew Melvil, was chosen Moderator ; and Mr. John Davison, the sternest and most zealous amongst his brethren, did not hesitate to arraign the pastors of the Kirk of coldness, self seeking, and negligence. Let them repent, said he, and betake themselves to their ordinary armour \u2014 fasting and prayer. Let the whole Kirk concur in this needful humiliation. Above all, let the rebel earls, Huntley, Errol, Angus, Auchendown, and their accomplices, whom it were idle to assail with any lighter censures, be solemnly excommunicated ; and 1 MS.

After much debate, it was resolved that the Roman Catholic rebels should be excommunicated ; and this upon the ground that many amongst them had been formerly students in the university of St. Andrews, and must, therefore, have signed the Confession of Faith. The terms of this sentence, in which not the whole Pres byterian sect, as represented by the General Assembly of their Kirk, but an isolated provincial synod, took upon them to excommunicate certain members of the Catholic church, were very awful. This little con clave declared that, in name and authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, they cut off the said persons from their communion, and delivered them to Satan, to the destruction of their flesh : it added, \u2014 that the spirit might yet be safe, if it pleased God to reclaim them by repentance ; but pronounced, if unrepentant, their just and everlasting condemnation.1 This sentence was commanded to be intimated in every kirk in the kingdom.

The impunity of the monstrous, ungodly, and unnatural treasons of Huntley, Angus, Errol, the Laird Auchendown, Sir James Chisholm, and their accomplices. 3.

The land defiled in divers places with the devilish and blasphemous Mass. 5. The wrath of God broken forth in fiery flame upon the north and south parts of the land with hor rible judgments, both of souls and bodies, threatening the mid part with the like or heavier, if repentance prevent not. 6. The king's slowness in repressing Papistry and planting of true religion. 7.

They publicly rebuked the Earl of Mor ton for keeping company with Errol and Angus, men branded by the Kirk as idolaters ; and when he defended himself by quoting the example of Henry the Fourth, the French king recently turned Catholic, they retorted that no Christian could, without error, associate with such delinquents.3 Meanwhile, Bothwell, instead of accepting the king's offered pardon and retiring from the realm, entered into fresh intrigues with England and trifled with the royal mercy.4 But James detected these new combinations ; and marching suddenly in person with a strong force from Stirling to the Doune of Menteith, where Athole, Gowrie, and Montrose had assembled with five hundred horse, attacked their company, made Gowrie and Montrose prisoners, and 1 Mr. James Blyth and Mr. John Aikman, ministers, had been slain by the Mures. 3 MS.

No opportunity, they said, had hitherto been given them of defending themselves before a jury. They had been excommunicated by the Kirk, banished from court, and compelled to lead the life of fugitives and traitors, without any evidence except a confession extorted by torture, and the ex hibition of some signatures asserted to be theirs, hut which they would prove to be forgeries. Let them only come to their trial. If found guilty, they were ready to suffer the penalty of their crimes ; if acquitted, as they trusted to be, then they would either satisfy the Kirk on the subject of their religion, and conform to the national faith, or would go into voluntary ban ishment.2 Not satisfied with these remonstrances, they suddenly presented themselves to the king as he rode from Holyrood to Lauder, and, falling on their knees, implored him to submit their alleged offences to the judgment of an assize. But James dismissed them with real or affected wrath, threatening that they should be worse handled for such boldness.3 Had the Catholic earls been sincere in the anxiety they expressed to have an impartial trial, it would have been the height of injustice to have refused their request ; but it was well known that they had secretly summoned all their friends to assemble in arms on \"their day of law;\" and such was their present 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 5th Oct. 1593 2 Ibid. 9th Oct. 1593. 3 Ibid. 12th Oct. 1593."], [242, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1593. 236 strength, that neither judges, jury, nor witnesses, could have attended with safety.1 It is not surpris ing that the Kirk should have loudly remonstrated against such hurried and premature proceedings ; and at an ecclesiastical convention of ministers, barons, and burghs, held at Edinburgh on the 17th October, for the purpose of considering the imminency of the threatened danger, they selected six commissioners to repair to the palace and present their advice, beseech ing the king that the trial might be delayed till the \" professors of the gospel should be ripely advised what was meetest for them to do, since they had resolved to be the principal accusers of these noblemen in their foul treasons.\" Amongst these commissioners is found an illustrious name, John Napier of Merchiston, the inventor of the logarithms. He had taken a leading part in this convention, and was at this time probably far better known for his espousal of the principles of the Kirk than for that profound genius which was to enlarge, by his wonderful discovery, the boundaries of science, and confer imperishable lustre upon his name.2 His brother commissioners were, Mr. James Maxwell of Calderwood, who along with Napier represented the barons ; Mr. James Melvile and Mr. Patrick Galloway, ministers ; and the two commissioners of Edinburgh and Dundee.

They resolved, that if their enemies attended in arms, they should meet them in the same fashion ; desiring the king's permission that \" the professors of religion may be his majesty's guard, and be admitted in the most sensible and warlike manner to be about the royal person, to defend it from violence, and accuse their enemies to the uttermost : and this,\" they added, \" we are minded to do, although it should be with the loss of all our lives in one day ; for cer tainly we are determined that the country shall not bruik us and them baith, so long as they are God's professed enemies.\"1 In furtherance of these pre parations, the Kirk directed the moderator of every presbytery to advertise each particular brother in the ministry within their bounds, to warn the noblemen, gentlemen, barons, and burgesses, to muster in warlike arms and array in Perth, on the 24th of the month, the expected day of trial ; and appointed twelve ministers as commissioners, to be resident in the capital till the answer to their demand was returned by the king.2 When the commissioners of the Kirk presented their petitions to James at Jedburgh, he 1 MS.

But Athole, Gowrie, and many of the town, are rather disposed to keep them out. The convocation and access of people to that place is looked upon to be so great that thereon bloody troubles shall arise.\"1 A collison appeared now inevitable ; and there were many causes which promised to make it, when it did occur, one of a fearful description. The opposite fac tions, whose partisans were flocking from all parts towards Perth, the anticipated scene of the trial, were animated by the most bitter and revengeful feelings ; their blood was boiling under the influence of family feuds, religious persecution, and fanatical hatred. The advocates for peace were browbeaten, and their voices drowned in the din of arms and pro clamations of mutual defiance ; and all this was ex asperated and increased by the warlike denunciations 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 20th Oct. 1593."], [245, "1593.

Had things been allowed to continue in this state, and the muster taken place at Perth, a few days more might have kindled the flames of civil war in the country, and deluged it with blood ; but at this crisis James wisely interdicted the trial from being held at Perth, and resolved that a solemn inquiry into the conduct of Huntley, Angus, and Errol, should take place before commissioners to be selected from the nobility, the burghs, and the Kirk. To secure tran quillity, public proclamation was made, that none except such as were especially called for should pre sume to attend the convention : that the three earls, dismissing their forces, should await the king's deter mination at Perth ; and that, in the mean season, none should molest them during the trial or inquiry which was about to take place. At all this the Kirk stood aghast. They had insisted on the imprisonment of the three earls. They had argued that, till they signed the Confession of Faith and reconciled them selves to the Kirk, they could not be recognised or permitted to take their trial ; that they ought to have no counsel to defend them ; and that the Kirk, as their accuser, should nominate the jury. Its ministers now complained, threatened, and remonstrated;1 but when the day appointed for the convention arrived, they found the king not only resolved to abide by his own judgment, but so strongly supported by the nobility whom he had summoned, that it would be vain to attempt resistance. 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, November 12, 1593.

The trial was postponed ; as it was believed that no jury could be found at that moment \" so void of favour and partiality\" as to con- demn the earls ; and, on the other hand, if acquitted, no terms or conditions could be imposed on them which their power would not enable them to despise and infringe.1 As to the accused themselves : on the one hand, they persisted in asserting their innocence as to the \"Spanish Blanks,\" which they were accused of having signed, or of any conspiracy to bring foreign forces into the realm ; on the other, they confessed that they had received Jesuits, heard Mass, revolted from the Presbyterian faith against their public pro- fession and subscription, refused to obey their sum- mons for treason, and committed other acts against the laws ; for which they were willing, they said, to put themselves in the king's mercy. All this was laid before a committee who represented the three estates \u2014 nobles, barons, and burghs : the Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Mar appearing for the earls ; the Lord Chancellor Maitland and Lord Livingston for the lords, with whom sat all the councillors of estate : the barons being represented by four of their number, the burghs by five burgesses, and the Kirk by six of the leading ministers ; who, however, ap peared only as petitioners, and did not sit or vote as commissioners.

The Catholics, who had never intermitted their intrigues with Spain, had lately received assistance and encouragement from that country ; they commanded almost the whole of the north ; and were in no temper to resign their re ligion, or retain it at the expense of perpetual exile. They temporized, therefore ; affected a submission which they did not feel ; and continued to strengthen themselves both at home and abroad for a new struggle. Do But if the Catholics were discontented, the Kirk re ceived the act of abolition with mingled wrath and lamentation. It actually seemed to them an insuffi cient security, and a trifling punishment, that no man was to be permitted to remain within the realm, and enjoy his estate and the protection of the law, unless he signed the Presbyterian Confession of Faith. The profanation was, that any man should be at liberty to retain his belief in the Roman Catholic faith, and his Scottish estates, if he consented to banish himself from his native country.

That this is very dangerous to the religion, and to all the pro fessors thereof, that the crimes of these offenders shall be thus slightly passed over ; and this notwith standing their treasons and faults are so manifest and odious, as the king once confessed that he had not power to pardon them, and promised, as he was a Christian prince, to punish them with all rigour. And the parties thus offending have now been detected four times, and escaped punishment for like treasons and conspiracies.\" 1 At this convention the king, who now found him self strong enough to disclose his true feelings, ex hibited the intensity of his wrath against Bothwell. It wTas in vain that the queen, and those nobles who had attached themselves to her service, interceded for the delinquent. He was commanded to leave the realm within fifteen days ; and James refused to listen to any offers, or to hold out the slightest hopes of forgiveness, till this order had been obeyed.

Lords Doune and Spiny, with Mr. John Russell, an eminent advocate who had pleaded his cause, were imprisoned ; and it was evident that all hope of reconciliation must be abandoned.1 The act of oblivion proved as distasteful to Eliza- beth as it was to either the Catholics or the Kirk. This great princess had recently received intelligence of the continued intrigues carried on by Jesuits and seminary priests in Scotland. One of these busy emissaries, Thomas Macquharry, a Scottish Jesuit, who had been employed by Lady Hume, and had carried on his secret practices in different parts of England, had been recently seized by Sir John Carey at Berwick. It was reported that another Scottish Jesuit, Mr. James Gordon, with William Gordon of Strathdon, a brother of the Earl of Huntley, and four or five other Catholics, had passed over from Scotland to Dunkirk ;2 and Mr. James Craig, a gentleman resi- dent at Bourdeaux, wrote to his brother Mr. Thomas Craig, the celebrated feudal lawyer, then an advocate at the Scottish bar,3 that an army and fleet were being equips in Spain, which were suspected to be destined for Scotland. Ireland continued to be the theatre of perpetual intrigue and commotion ; and the English queen had taken the adoption of the Catholic faith by Henry the Fourth greatly to heart. She was, there fore, in a highly excited state when she received from Bowes, her ambassador, the news from Scotland ; and lost no time in despatching Lord Zouch with a violent open remonstrance, and a letter of secret rebuke, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 2d Dec. 1593. 2 Ibid. 24th November, 1593.

May this blind me that knows what a king's office were to do ? Abuse not vourself so far. Indeed, when a weak bowing and a slack seat in go vernment shall appear, then bold spirits will stir the stern, and guide the ship to greatest wreck, and will take heart to supply the failure. \" Assure yourself no greater peril can ever befall 1 Camden, Elizabeth in Kennet, vol. ii. 2 In the copy in the State-paper Office, \" the path you are in.\""], [252, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1593. 246 you, nor any king else, than to take for payment evil accounts ; for they deride such, and make their prey of their neglect.

He knew, he said, in answer to Zouch's remonstrances on his supposed Spanish predilections, what it was to lose an old friend and to trust a new. As to the councillors, of whom she complained, he must confide in his council as she confided in hers ; but he was the last who would suffer any ill affected to insinuate themselves amongst his ministers.1 With these general assurances, Elizabeth's ambas sador would not be satisfied. He called on the king for deeds, not words ; insisted that his royal mistress was entitled to have an express written declaration of the course which the king was determined to follow with the rebel earls and the Catholic party, still busy in their plots for the invasion of England and the de struction of their common faith ;2 and lamented, in his letter to Lord Burghley, that he was utterly unfit to cope with the difficulties which met him on every hand. The Lord Chancellor Maitland, whom he wTas taught to consider the wisest and most upright of the king's councillors, plotted, as he suspected, against him ; and had received, it was said, great sums of money from the Catholic faction. He was surrounded by falsehood and suspicion ; distracted by contrary reports ; and so strictly watched, that none came near him but those whom the king permitted.

Whilst assuring James of Elizabeth's un shaken friendship and zeal for his welfare, he opened a communication with his bitter foe, the fierce and reckless Bothwell ; and arranged with this earl, John Colvile brother of the Laird of Wemyss, Henry Lock an agent of Sir Robert Cecil, and some of the most violent ministers of the Kirk, a new plot for the sur prise of the king. It was resolved that Athole and Argyle, with the whole strength of the north, should advance to Edinburgh ; form a junction with the forces of Bothwell, Montrose, Ochiltree, and the Laird of Johnston ; and attacking the Chancellor Maitland, Lord Hume, and the friends of the king, at once destroy Huntley and the Roman Catholics, save James from evil counsellors, and take an ample revenge for the murder of the Earl of Moray.1 These designs were the more unjustifiable at this moment, as the monarch had adopted strong measures against the Roman Catholic earls. He had declared them ex cluded from all benefits of the act of abolition ;2 had summoned them, on the penalty of being outlawed, to deliver themselves up, and take their trials for treason ; called a parliament, which was to be held in April ; appointed a new council of more neutral and well affected nobles and- barons ; and had professed to Elizabeth, in a written answer to Zouch's instructions, his continued desire of friendship and good faith.

He was steadfast, he affirmed, in his religion, whatever Papists or the Kirk might affirm : nothing would induce him to embrace the Spanish courses ; and for an invasion of England, he knew it would be madness.1 Yet Zouch continued his plots ; and Elizabeth undoubtedly gave them her secret en couragement ; although, with her usual caution and parsimony, she abstained from any large advances either in money or troops. In the midst of these intrigues and dangers a joyful event occurred. The queen brought forth a son, her first child, in the castle of Stirling, on the 19th February ; and the monarch immediately committed the charge and government of the infant heir to the throne to the Earl of Mar, captain and keeper of the castle of Stirling ; \" whose uncle and goodsire, [it is stated in the act of appointment,] by three descents together, have had the custody and governance of the sovereign princes of this realm.\" 2 By the nation this event was hailed with universal joy ; an old chronicle declaring that \" the people, in all parts, appeared to be daft for mirth.\"3 But scarcely was the child born ere he became a mark for treachery ; the conspirators proposing to Lord Zouch, that when they advanced 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 8th Jan. 1593-4.

It was a game which had already been played in the days of James the Third. The English ambassador, however, protested against such an outrage, and his associates did not dare to disobey. All was now ripe for Bothwell's attempt ; but the king proved too crafty and strong for his adversaries. He had received secret information of the plot ; seized a gentleman of Zouch's suite, who had communicated with the traitors ; commanded Lord Hume, Cessford, and Buccleuch, to concentrate their strength at Kelso, where it was expected the enemy would cross the border ; imprisoned some of the boldest and busiest ministers of the Kirk ; and addressing the people in the High Church of Edinburgh after the sermon, informed them in stirring terms, of the insolence of Bothwell, that audacious rebel, who was at that mo ment on his way to attack his lawful prince ; declared his resolution to lead his whole force in person against him ; and, raising his hand to heaven, took a solemn vow to God, that if they, for their part, would instantly arm and advance with him into the field, he, for his, would never rest till, in return for such service, he had utterly suppressed and banished the Catholic lords from his dominions.1 Scarcely had James ended this appeal, when word was brought that Bothwell, who had out-man\u0153uvred Hume and Buccleuch, was at hand, at Leith, with six hundred horse, awaiting the junction of Athole and Argyle, whom he expected to cross the Forth with their northern strength, and showing intentions of intrenching himself within the 1 Historie of James the Sext, p. 304."], [258, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1594. 252 old fortifications on the Links. Without a moment's delay, the king assembled his troops, and marched against him. The advance consisted of a thousand pikemen and five hundred horse ; the rear, of the infantry of the city of Edinburgh, in number about a thousand musketeers; and besides these, there were three guns covered by a body of two hundred horse. Despairing of being able to withstand such a force within the intrenchments, Bothwell retired delibe rately, and in good order, in a south-easterly direction, round the roots of the hill of Arthur Seat, towards Niddry, where he halted on a neighbouring field, which offered him an excellent position. James, observing this movement, now dreaded an attack of his capital on the south side, where it was undefended ; and ordering Hume, at the head of the cavalry, to advance to Niddry, countermarched through Edinburgh, and took up his ground with the remainder of the troops on the Borough Muir. Meanwhile, Hume and Glammis had reached a hill beside Niddry, and were hesitating to make the onset, when Bothwell, Lord Ochiltree, and the gentlemen with them, \" after prayers on their knees,\" assailed them with loud shouts of \" God and the Kirk,\" drove them from their ground, slew twelve of their troopers, and chased them to within a short distance of the spot where the king stood. They then sounded their trumpets, and retired in good order by Craigmillar without losing a man. In this onset, Bothwell took Hume's cornet and trumpet, to whom he gave his liberty ; and presenting him with two rose nobles, sent by him a challenge to his master.1 This 1 We learn from Henry Lock's letter to Sir Robert, describing the \" raid,\" and written from Berwick only two days after the action, that before they charged their adversaries, Bothwell and his companions exclaimed, that \"that day her Majesty should see proof of their in tentions and faith.\" MS. letter, State-paper Office, Henry Lock to"], [259, "JAMES VI. 1594. 253 defeat took place on an eminence beside Niddry, called Edmeston Edge.1 Bothwell now retreated to Kelso ; and aware of the hopelessness of his enterprise, soon after dispersed his company, and became once more a refugee in England. The king, delivered for the present from all appre hensions on this quarter, now determined to fulfil his promise, and deprive the Queen of England and the ministers of the Kirk of all pretence of opposition, by adopting the most vigorous proceedings against the Catholic earls, Huntley, Angus, and Errol. Procla mation was made, that these noblemen should appear and take their trial before the parliament to be held in May. The whole force of his realm was summoned to meet him in arms, to be led against the rebels if they resisted ; and Colvile of Easter Wemyss, one of the best military leaders then in Scotland, with Mr. Edward Bruce, an influential minister of the Kirk, were despatched on an embassy to Elizabeth. The general object of their mission was to assure her of their master's resolute determination to reduce the Catholic earls, and for ever put an end to the Spanish intrigues ; but before proceeding to any other point, they were enjoined to remonstrate, in the strongest terms, against the support lately given in England to the king's avowed rebel, the Earl of Bothwell.

And again, that so wise and provident a prince, having so long and happily governed, should be so fyled and con temned by a great number of her own subjects, it is hardly to be believed ; if I knew it not to be a maxim in the state of princes, that we see and hear all with the eyes and ears of others, and if these be deceivers, we cannot shun deceits. \" Now, madam, I have refuge to you at this time, as my only pilot to guide me safely betwixt this Charybdis and Scylla.

But if you gave him a large com mission, I dare answer for it he took it as well upon him : and therefore have I rather chused to send you my answer by my own messengers.

The object of all these missions was the same : to carry to the king's faithful and ancient allies the happy news of the birth of a prince ; to invite them to send their representatives to the baptism, which had been fixed for the 15th of July; and to hint delicately to the United States, but in perfectly intelligible terms, the necessity of presenting, at that solemn ceremony, something more substantial than congratulations.2 Important events now crowded rapidly on each other.

The ex pense incurred in these triumphs and shows, in which there was an unusual allowance of chariots, mimic ships, Christian knights, rural deities, Moors, wind mills, and amazons, must have been excessive, judging from the account of a contemporary pamphlet, written in the highest style of quaint and courtly composition.1 The baptism itself took place on the 30th of August, in the royal chapel at Stirling castle. The infant prince was carried by Sussex, Elizabeth's ambassador. He was christened by Cunningham, bishop of Aber deen, by the name of Frederick Henry, Henry Fred erick ; and when the solemn ceremony was concluded, and the king, the ambassadors and nobles, with the queen and her ladies of honour, retired from the chapel to the hall of state, \" the cannons of the castle roared, so that therewith the earth trembled ; and other smaller shot,\" says one of the city orators of the time, \" made their harmony after their kind.\" The infant was then knighted by his royal father, \" touched with the spur\" by the Earl of Mar ; and being crowned with a ducal coronet, richly set with diamonds, sapphires, 1 State-paper Office.

The ceremony being concluded, and the voice of revelry hushed in the palace, the Earl of Sussex, after a few days, took leave, bearing with him this letter from the king to his royal mistress.

But in this I remit you to your own wisdom ; for you are not ignorant how occasion is painted. And now I cannot omit to lay before you some incident griefs of mine ; but lest I weary you too much with my ragged handwrit, I remit the particulars hereof to the report of this noble man, only touching thus far by the way. I think ye have not given commission to any of your council to treat with Bothwell's ambassador, nor yet allow that his agent, and one guilty of all his treasons, should use his public devotion in the French Kirk, in presence of my ambassador ; who, indeed, was better furnished with patience at the sight thereof than he is likely to get thanks for at my hands : yet now, madam, none can brook me and Bothwell both.

The Catholic earls were now alluring this audacious man, by Spanish gold, to make common cause with them against the Scottish king. Bothwell, on the other hand, with consummate baseness, had proposed to Cecil to accept the money and betray their secrets to the Queen of England, if she would still stand his friend in his present distress and misery. But he was no longer the proud and powerful partisan whom Elizabeth had once so highly favoured ; and the moment she discovered that James had detected his intrigues, she threw him from her with as much indifference as she would a broken sword ; commanded him to leave her domi nions ; and interdicted her subjects, under the severest penalties, from giving him harbour or assistance. He was no longer permitted, in the strong language which the king himself used in his remonstrance to Sussex, to \" tak muster, display cornet or ensign, blaw trum pet, strike drum,\" or even in any way live and breathe within England.2 Having secured this expulsion of his mortal enemy, James assembled a convention at Stirling,3 and made 1 MS.

On both sides a violent and deter mined struggle was anticipated ; as there were many deep feelings and bitter passions which festered in the minds of the leaders and their hosts. With the Kirk, it was a war of religious persecution or rather exter mination. Their avowed object was to depose Anti christ, and to compel all Catholics to recant, or at once give up their lands, their honours, and their country, for their privilege to adhere to that Church which they believed to be of divine origin and the only depository of the truth. But to these feelings were added, as may be easily imagined, many motives and passions of baser alloy : ambition, love of plunder, deep feudal hatred, long-delayed and fondly-cherished hopes of revenge ; and all that catalogue of dark and merciless passions which spring from the right of private war and the prevalence of family feuds. These all raged in the bosoms of the opposed leaders and combatants ; and the exacerbation they produced, was shown alike by the energy of their preparations and the cruelty with which they fought. Huntley, Angus, Errol, and Auchendown, since their refusal of the act of aboli tion,1 had been gathering their strength, and were now busily engaged in levying recruits, partly at their own charges, partly with Spanish gold, of which they had received repeated supplies. It had been now for many years the practice of Elizabeth, with the permission of James, to employ large bodies of Scottish auxiliaries in her wars in the Low Countries. Scottish troops, also, often served in Ireland ; and the Highland chiefs had long driven a lucrative and warlike commerce with that country, selling their services to the highest bidder, and carrying over large bodies of pikemen, 1 Supra, p. 241."], [271, "1594. JAMES VI. 265 bowmen, and even of hagbutteers, to the assistance of Elizabeth or her enemies, as it best suited their in terest. From these causes, there were now in Scot land many experienced officers and numerous bands of mercenaries, ready, like the Italian Condottieri, or the Swiss bands, to offer their service wherever they heard the tuck of drum or the clink of gold ; and as Huntley had high reputation as a military leader, lived in almost regal splendour in his palace at Strathbogie, and was young, generous, and brave, the Catholic camp was in no want of recruits, and soon assumed a formi dable appearance. He was now also joined by Both well, who, driven to desperation by the mortal hatred of the Scottish king ; his recent proscription by the Queen of England ; his desertion by the Kirk, who had detected his dealings with the Catholics; and the hunting down, torturing, and execution of his poor vassals, had been unable to resist the bribes held out to him. The papers still exist which enable us to trace the last struggles and plots of this desperate man ; but we can only give them a passing glance- It was arranged between him and his new associates, that when Huntley was engaged in the north, Both well should make a diversion in the south ; thus dis tracting the king and dividing his forces. But this was not all. He entered into an agreement with his new friends, in which it was proposed, by a sudden coup de main, to attack the court, imprison the king, seize the infant prince, murder Sir George Hume the king's favourite ; and, as he himself expressed it in his letter to the ministers of the Kirk, \"put in practice the loveable custom of their progenitors at Lander,\" by completely revolutionizing the government.1 It was 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bothwell to the Presbytery of Edinburgh, 7th September, 1594."], [272, "266 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1594. asserted, and on good grounds, that the usual \" Band,\" or feudal agreement in such conspiracies, was drawn up and signed by the enterprisers ; but the time for its execution was not fixed ; and the seizure of some of the inferior agents, with the course of events in the north, happily rendered the whole plot abortive. These events were of a stirring and romantic kind ; for, on the 21st September, Argyle, having received the royal commission to pursue Huntley and his associates, set out on his expedition at the head of a force of six thousand men. Of this army, three thousand only were chosen men, bearing harquebuses, bows, and pikes ; the rest being more slenderly equips, both as to body-armour and weapons. Of cavalry, he had few or none ; but he expected to be joined by Lord Forbes, with the Laird of Towey, the Dunbars, and other barons, who, it was hoped, would form a strong reinforcement, and be mostly mounted.1 It had been the king's intention to postpone the attack upon the insurgent barons till he had assembled the whole force of his realm, and was ready to take the command in person. But the ministers of the Kirk urged the danger of delay : some of them even buckled on their broadswords and rode to the camp; whilst Argyle himself, young, (he was only nineteen,) ardent, and acting under the stimulus of personal revenge, deter mined on instant action. He had already, he said, been twice on the eve of marching, and twice been countermanded ; but now the slaughter of his brother in-law, the Earl of Moray, should be avenged on Hunt ley ; to whom he sent a message that, within three days, he meant to sleep at Strathbogie. To this taunt ing challenge Huntley replied, that Argyle should be 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Sir R. Cecil, 27th Sept. XQoQ:*"], [273, "1594. JAMES VI. 267 welcome : he would himself be his porter, and open all the gates of his palace to his young friend ; but he must not take it amiss if he rubbed his cloak against Argyle's plaid ere they parted.1 On advancing to Aberdeen, Argyle ordered Red Lion, the herald, to proclaim the royal commission by sound of trumpet in the market-place, and appointed Sir Lauchlan Maclean of Duart to the chief command under himself. He was joined by the Macintoshes, the Grants, the Clan Gregor, the Macgillivrays, with all their friends and dependants, and by the whole surname of the Campbells ; with many others, whom either greediness of prey or malice against the Gordons had thrust into that expedition. These, including the rabble of camp-followers, or, as Bowes terms them, \"rascals and poke-bearers,\" formed a body of ten thou sand strong. But of this number only six thousand were fighting men ; and out of these there were not above fifteen hundred disciplined harquebusiers, chiefly serving under Maclean ; the rest being promiscuously armed with dirks, swords, dags, Lochaber axes, two handed swords, and bows and arrows. He had neither cavalry nor artillery ; and a large part of his force was totally regardless of discipline, disdaining command, composed of chieftains and people distracted by old feuds and suspicions, marching, as described by an eye-witness, \" at raggle and in plumps, without order.\" The earl had also along with him a noted sorceress, whose incantations, in the superstitious spirit of the times, were expected to bring to light the treasures which might be hid under ground by the terrified inhabitants.2 With this army Argyle proceeded into 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Sir R.

He had no means of battering the walls; and abandoning the siege, he led his troops' through the hills to Strathbogie. It was his purpose to ravage this country, which belonged to Huntley, with fire and sword ; and thence come down into the Lowlands to form a junction with Lord Forbes, who, with his own kin and the Frasers, Dunbars, Ogilvies, Leslies, and others, were at that moment on their way to meet him. With this object, he arrived on the 2d of October at Drimmin in Strathdown, where he encamped ; 1 and soon after received news that Huntley and Errol were in the neighbourhood, and purposed to attack him, in spite of their great inferi ority in force. The disparity was indeed great ; for the Catholic earls could not muster above fifteen hundred, or, at most, two thousand men. But of these the greater part were resolute and gallant gentlemen, all well mounted and fully armed ; and amongst them some officers of veteran experience, who had served in the Low Countries. They had, besides, six pieces of ordnance, which were placed under the charge of Captain Andrew Gray, who afterwards commanded the English and Scottish auxiliaries in Bohemia.2 On the morning of the 3d of October, Huntley, who had marched from Strathbogie to Auchendown, the castle of Sir Patrick Gordon, having received word by his scouts that Argyle was at no great distance, sent Captain Thomas Kerr, a veteran officer, at the head of a small body of cavalry, to view the enemy 1 Warrender MSS. vol. B. p. 9. 2 Ibid. In which there is a minute contemporary account of the battle of Glenlivat."], [275, "1594. JAMES VI. 269 and report their strength. In executing this, he fell in with Argyle's \" spials,\" and slew them all except one, who brought him to the vicinity of their encamp 'ment, which was near Glenlivat, in the mountainous district of Strathavon. On his return, Captain Kerr concealed the number of their opponents, affirming that a few resolute men might easily have the advan- tage ; and Huntley, following his advice, instantly marched forward. Errol led the advance, supported by Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, the Lairds of Gicht, Bonniton Wood, and Captain Kerr and three hundred gentlemen. Huntley commanded the rear- ward, having on his right the Laird of Clunie-Gordon, on his left Gordon of Abergeldie, and the six pieces of artillery so placed as to be completely masked, or covered, by the cavalry, so that they were dragged forward unperceived within range of the enemy's posi- tion. They then opened their fire ; and on the first discharge, which was directed at the yellow standard of Argyle, struck down and slew Macneill, the Laird of Barra's third son, one of their bravest officers, and Campbell of Lochnell, who held the standard. This successful commencement occasioned extraordinary confusion amongst the Highlanders, to many of whom the terrible effects of artillery were even at this late day unknown ; and a large body of them, yelling and brandishing their broadswords and axes, made some ineffectual attempts to reach the horsemen ; but re- ceiving another fire from the little ordnance-train of Captain Gray, they took to flight, and in an incre- dibly short time were out of sight and pursuit. Still, however, a large body remained ; and Argyle had the advantage not only of the sun, then shining fiercely in the eyes of his opponents, glancing on their steel coats and making the plain appear on fire, but of the"], [276, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1594. 270 ground : for his army were arrayed on the top of a steep hill covered with high heather and stones, whilst the ground at the bottom was soft and mossy, full of holes, called in that country peat-pots, and danger ous for cavalry. But all this did not deter Huntley 's vanguard, under Errol and Auchendown, from advan cing resolutely to the attack. Errol, however, dreading the marsh, made an oblique movement by some firmer ground which lay on one side, and hoped thus to turn the flank of the enemy ; but Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, urged on by his fiery temper, spurred his horse directly towards the hill, and getting en tangled with his men in the mossy ground, was exposed to a murderous fire from the force under Maclean of Duart. This chieftain was conspicuous from his great stature and strength ; he was covered with a shirt of mail, wielded a double-edged Danish battle-axe, and appears to have been a more expe rienced officer than the rest ; as he placed his men, who were mostly \" harquebusiers,\" in a small copse wood hard by, from which they could deliver their fire, and be screened from the attack of cavalry. Auchendown, nevertheless, although his ranks were dreadfully thinned by this fire of the enemy's infantry, managed to disengage them, and spurring up the hill, received a bullet in the body, and fell from his horse ; whilst his companions shouted with grief and rage, and made desperate efforts to rescue him. The High landers, however, who knew him well, rushed in upon him, despatched him with their dirks, and cutting off his head, displayed it in savage triumph : a sight which so enraged the Gordons, that they fought with a fury which alike disregarded discipline and life. This gave an advantage to Maclean, who, enclosing the enemy's vanguard, and pressing it into narrow"], [277, "1594. JAMES VI. 271 space between his own force and Argyle's, would have cut them to pieces had not Huntley come speedily to their support and renewed the battle ; attacking both Argyle and Maclean with desperate energy, and calling loudly to his friends to revenge Auchendown. It was at this moment that some of the Gordons caught a sight of Fraser, the king's herald, wdio rode beside Argyle, and was dressed in his tabard, with the red lion embroidered on it, within the double tressure. This ought to have been his protection ; but it seemed rather to point him out as a victim : and the horsemen shouting out, \" Have at the Lion,\" ran him through with their spears, and slew him on the spot. The battle was now at its height, and raged for two hours with the utmost cruelty. Errol was severely wounded with a bullet in the arm, and by one of the sharp-barbed arrows of the Highland bowmen, which pierced deep into the thigh. He lost his pennon or guidon also ; which was won by Maclean. Gordon of Gicht was struck with three bullets through the body, and had two plaits of his steel coat carried into him ; wounds which next day proved mortal. Huntley himself was in imminent danger of his life ; for his horse was shot under him, and the Highlanders were about to attack him on the ground with their knives and axes, when he was extricated and horsed again by Innermarkie ; after which he again charged the enemy under Argyle, whose troops wavered, and at last began to fly in such numbers that only twenty men were left round him. Upon this the young chief, overcome with grief and vexation at so disgraceful a desertion, shed tears of rage, and would have still renewed the fight, had not Murray of Tullibardine seized his bridle and forced him off the field. Seeing the day lost, Maclean, who"], [278, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1594. 272 had done most, and suffered least in this cruel fight, withdrew his men from the wood, and retired in good order ; but seven hundred Highlanders were slain in the chase, which was continued till the steepness of the mountains rendered further pursuit impossible. Such was the celebrated battle of Glenlivat. The loss on Huntley's side was mostly of gentlemen, of whom Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, his uncle, \" a wise, valiant, and resolute knight,\" was chiefly lamented. Besides him, twenty other gentlemen were slain, and some forty or fifty wounded ; but the victory was complete, and recalled to memory the bloody fight of Harlaw, in 1411, between the Earl of Mar and Donald Balloch ; in which, under somewhat similar circumstances, the superior armour and dis cipline of the Lowdand knights proved too strong for the ferocious but irregular efforts of a much larger force of Highlanders.1 During these transactions, the king, unconscious of this reverse, had left his palace at Stirling, and advanced with his army to Dundee, where Argyle, in person, brought him the news of his own defeat. James, howTever, was more enraged than dismayed by this intelligence. He had left his capital so well de fended2 that he dreaded nothing from Bothwell. He knew that, from the exhausted state of the country, it would be impossible for Huntley to keep his forces together ; and he swore that the death of a royal herald, who had been murdered with the king's coat on, should be avenged on these audacious rebels. Nor did he fail to keep his promise. In spite of the seve- 1 The above account of the battle of Glenlivat is taken chiefly from the original letters of Bowes, who was on the spot. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Sir R.

This noble residence of Huntley,2 which had been fourteen years in building, was blown up with gun powder, and levelled in two days, nothing being left but the great old tower, whose massive masonry defied the efforts of the pioneers ; whilst its master, deserted by his barons and dependants, fled into the mountainous parts of Caithness.3 James had been much incensed against him by the scornful contents of an intercepted letter written to Angus, in which Huntley spoke of the king's rumoured campaign as likely to turn out a \"gowk's storm.\" i Slaines in Buchan, the principal castle of Errol, who still lay languishing from his wounds ; Culsamond in Garioch, the house of the Laird of Newton-Gordon ; Bagays and Craig in Angus, the castles of Sir Walter Lindsay and Sir John Ogilvy, successively shared the fate of Strathbogie. Indeed, there is little doubt that the royal severity, whetted by the exhortations of Andrew Melvil, who bore a pike and joined the soldiers in the destruction of Strathbogie, would have fallen still heavier on this devoted district, had not famine, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Sir R.

These were ordered to assist the Duke of Lennox, whose residence was to be in Aberdeen, Elgin, or Inverness, until Argyle, who had been appointed by James to the permanent government of the north, should as semble his friends and relieve him of his charge. Meanwhile, the Duke was empowered to hold Justice Ayres, or courts for the punishment of offenders ; and the barons and gentlemen of the north bound them- 1 MS.

James had now fulfilled all his promises to Elizabeth ; and by the severity with which he had put down the rebellion of the Catholic earls, had more than fulfilled the expectations of the Kirk.

He had done this, trusting to her promises of that pecuniary aid which was absolutely necessary for the payment of his troops ; and before he set out, had despatched his secretary, Sir Robert Cockburn, to the English court,1 with the perfect confidence that every thing which had been undertaken by \" his good sister,\" would be fulfilled. In this, however, he was miserably disappointed. Whilst the king was engaged in burning and razing the houses of the Catholics, Elizabeth and the now venerable Burghley were closeted at Greenwich, lay ing their heads together to find out some plausible excuse for stopping the payment of the promised supplies. Cockburn, the ambassador, was artfully detained and delayed from week to week, and month to month, till the result of the campaign could be guessed with some certainty. When this was ascer tained, the sum of two thousand pounds, for wdiich an order had been given, was recalled;2 and a paper was drawn up by Lord Burghley, detailing the sums paid by England to James since the year 1586, and proving, to the perfect satisfaction of Elizabeth if not of James, that instead of any money being then due to the King of Scotland, he had been overpaid to the extent of six thousand five hundred pounds.3 This, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir R.

For this unwise and double conduct in the queen there could be no defence. She had first excited James to this northern expedition by flattery and large promises of support ; she now forgot all, and deserted him without scruple or remorse. Such a mode of proceeding roused his passion to a pitch of unusual fury ; and when Sir R. Cockburn returned, the storm broke pitilessly on his head. The king at the same time expressed, in no moderate terms, his rage and suspicion against Burghley and Sir Robert Cecil, by whose advice Elizabeth had acted ; and some busy courtiers blew the coals, by assuring him that both father and son were involved in the intrigues and treasons of Bothwell. Had the queen kept her promises, (so he said,) had she not throwm to the winds her solemn assurances made him by her am bassadors. Lord Burgh and Lord Zouch, the land would have been utterly purged of the enemies to God, religion, and both the countries. But now mat ters might proceed as they pleased. If the enemy revived ; if they began again to look confidently for Spanish money, and Spanish messengers ; if recruits were raised in the Isles to assist the Catholics and O'Neill in Ireland ; if the rebel earls and Bothwell had met together as they were reported to have done ; if, in his own council, plots were being carried on in favour of the Catholics, and his own life were not safe from the efforts of desperate men, who had conspired"], [285, "1594. JAMES VI. 279 to set up the young prince and pull him from his royal seat : all these manifold dangers and miseries were to be ascribed most justly to his desertion by Elizabeth. He had performed his part, and more than redeemed all the pledges which he had given. She had not only failed in all her promises, but now had the hardihood to disavow them ; and she might take the consequences. If he was himself compelled to look to other friendships, and accept of other offers of assistance contrary to his own wishes ; if the members of his council, who were inclined to the Catholic side, had now more to say than before ; if at the moment when Spanish intrigues were about to be extinguished for ever, he was arrested in his course ; all was her fault, not his.1 He must now strengthen himself as he best could, and place no more implicit reliance upon English promises. It was impossible to deny the justice of these com plaints ; and although for the moment all was quiet in the north under the government of the Duke of Lennox, there were many subjects for anxiety. The king's debts were enormous, and more money still was imperiously required to pay his troops and retain the advantages he had acquired. His late severities to the Catholic earls, and his alliance with the Kirk, the ministers of which now lauded as highly as they had vituperated him, had lost him the friendship of all his foreign allies, and of the influential body of the Eng lish Catholics ; and within his own court and council there were so many rivalries and jealousies, so much plotting and intriguing, that, on his return, he found the campaign in the north almost less irksome than the civil battles he had to fight in his own palace. 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir R.

Maitland's faction was strong; embracing Hamilton, Athole, Hume, Buccleuch, Ogilvy, and many others. Mar, on the other hand, had the keeping of the prince, commanded the castles of Stirling and Edinburgh, and enjoyed the complete confidence of the king, who had become somewhat suspicious and impatient under the grasping and increasing power of the chancellor. But James had another and nearer source of anx iety in the queen, who was equally the enemy of Mar and Maitland. This princess, for a considerable period after her marriage, appears to have shunned all inter ference with party or public affairs; but she was jealous of Maitland, who had opposed her marriage, and was said to have secretly attacked her honour; and of Mar, because her son, the young heir to the throne, had been committed in charge to him rather than to her. Besides, she and the king, though out wardly living on fair and decent terms, were neither loving nor confidential. James's cold temperament and coarse jokes disgusted the queen, who wTas not insensible to admiration ; and she consoled herself, for the desertion of her lord, in the more attractive society of the young Duke of Lennox, the noblest of the Scot tish courtiers. This, on the other hand, roused the royal jealousy : and about the time of the christening, Mr. John Colvile assured Sir Robert Cecil, whom he calls his most honourable lord and M\u00e6cenas, that matters were on a very miserable footing. He writes as follows : \u2014 \" These few lines I thought meet only to put in your hands, to go no further but to her majesty, and your most honourable father, my special good lord.

The president of the Session, called the Prior of Pluscardine, is by her indirectly stirred up to counterpoise the chancellor, who she blames of all these slanders ; and the chancellor is indirectly sup ported by the other ; both the princes holding the Wolf by the ears.\" 1 We know also, from a letter of Mr. James Murray, a gentleman of the bedchamber, that about this time a plot had been laid for the \" disgrace of the queen and the Duke of Lennox ; and to so bitter and mortal an excess had the king's fears and jealousy proceeded shortly before the baptism, that he had doubts as to the paternity of Prince Henry.\" 2 On the 30th of July, a month before the baptism, Colvile wrote thus to Sir R. Cecil: The \"king repents him sore that he has made such convention to this baptism ; for upon the jealousy mentioned in my last he begins to doubt of the child. I think he had not been baptised at this time if so many princes had not been invited. That matter takes deep root upon both sides.

In the north, also, every thing was in commotion ; for although Lennox had, for a brief season, succeeded in restoring tranquillity, by the vigour with which he had executed the charge committed to him, all became again disordered on his retirement from office. The great cause of these excesses was to be traced to some extraordinary discoveries made at this time by the young Earl of Argyle, which showed that treachery, not cowardice, had been the cause of his defeat at Glenlivat. It was found out, by the confessions of some accomplices, that Campbell of Lochnell, the near relative of the young chief, and, failing an only brother, the heir to his estates and honours, had been tamper ing with Huntley ; and that the flight of so large a body of Highlanders was only part of a conspiracy against the life of Argyle. It was discovered, also, by evidence which could not be contradicted, that this foul plot against the young earl was intimately con nected with the late murder of the Earl of Moray and the assassination of the Laird of Calder ; that all wrere branches of one great conspiracy, of which a chief con triver was Maitland the chancellor, assisted by Hunt ley, Duncan Campbell of Glenurchy, Archibald Camp bell of Lochnell, Sir James Campbell of Ardkinglass, Macaulay of Ardincaple, and John Lord Maxwell. These titled and official ruffians, in the spirit of the times, which could combine the strictest legal pre-"], [289, "1594. JAMES VI. 283 cision with the utmost familiarity with blood, had drawn up a band, by which, in the most solemn man ner, they became mutually bound to each other to achieve the murder of James earl of Moray, Archibald earl of Argyle, Colin Campbell of Lundy his only brother, and John Campbell of Calder. The result was to be, the possession of the earldom of Argyle by Lochnell, and the appropriation of a large part of its princely estates by the Chancellor Maitland and the other conspirators. With the success of one part of this conspiracy, the cruel murder of the Earl of Moray, we are already acquainted ; 1 and in the case of the Laird of Calder they were also successful : for this unfortunate gentleman was about this time shot at night, through the window of his own house in Lorn, by an assassin named M'Kellar, who had been fur nished with a hagbut by Ardkinglass, which, to make surer work, he had loaded with three bullets. So far this diabolical plot was followed out with success. But at this crisis, the remorse or interest of Ardkinglass revealed the conspiracy to Argyle ; and the appre hension, torture, and confession of John Oig Campbell and M'Kellar, who were executed, led, at last, to the revelation of the \" Great Contract,\" as it was called. The \" band \" itself fell into the hands of Argyle, and convinced him that the assassination of his unhappy friends, Moray and Calder, was to have been followed, on the first good opportunity that should present itself, by the murder of himself. Of all this the consequences were dreadful. Argyle hurried to the north, assem bled his vassals, and proclaimed a war of extermination against Huntley, and all who had opposed or deserted him at Glenlivat.2 Huntley, on the other hand, 1 Supra, p. 179. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir R.

The ministers of the Kirk, in the meantime, sounded their terrible trumpet of warning to all true men, denoun cing from the pulpit the reviving influence of the Catholics ; and large bodies of soldiers, disbanded for want of pay, roamed over the country, and committed every sort of robbery and excess. Ministers of reli gion were murdered ; fathers slain by their own sons ; brothers by their brethren ; married women ravished under their own roof; houses, with their miserable inmates, burned amidst savage mirth ; and the land so utterly wasted by fire, plunder, and the total cessa tion of agricultural labour, that famine at last stalked in to complete the horrid picture, and destroy, by the most terrible of deaths, those who had escaped the sword.2 Amidst these dreadful excesses, the only support of the country was in the energy of the king : for his council was torn by faction, and some of the chief dignitaries were the offenders.

Bothwell especially, that once proud and potent baron, who had been the correspondent of Elizabeth, the friend of Burghley, the pillar of the Kirk, the arbiter of the court, and the idol of the people, was reduced to the lowest extremity. He had been expelled from all his castles and houses; and now the Hermitage, his last and strongest den, was in the hands of Hume, his mortal enemy.3 Scott the Laird of Balwearie, one of his chief friends, who was acquainted with the secrets of his recent conspi racy with the Catholic earls, was seized, and purchased his life by a full revelation of the plot.

This person had taken his passage in a Dutch ship, and was landed at Leith ; but the disguise under which he travelled had not concealed him from a fellow passenger, a son of Erskine of Dun, who hinted his suspicion to Mr. David Lindsay ; and this active minister of the Kirk instantly pounced upon Father Morton, as he was called, who, in the struggle with the officers of justice, tore his secret instructions with his teeth.2 The fragments, however, were picked up, joined together, their contents deciphered, and the king, who piqued himself upon his shrewdness in cross examination, exerted his powers with much success. He brought Morton to confess that he was a Jesuit, though he appeared only a Scottish gentleman seeking his native air for the recovery of his health ; that he was confessor to the Seminary College in Rome, and sent into Scotland by the pope, and with special mes- 1 MS. letter, State-paper- Office, Nicolson to Sir R.

It con vinced Huntley and Errol, that for the present their cause was desperate, and that to retire into a tempo rary banishment was the only resource which remained. It was in vain that Father Gordon, Huntley's uncle, and a devoted Catholic, implored them to remain ; in vain that on a solemn occasion, when Mass was said for the last time in the cathedral church at Elgin, this zealous priest, descending from the high altar and mounting the pulpit, exhorted them not to depart, but remain in their native country and hazard all for the faith. His discourse fell on deaf ears ; and finding entreaty fruitless, he resolved to accompany them. On the 17th of March, Errol embarked at Peterhead : and on the 19th, two days after, Huntley, with his uncle and a suite of sixteen persons, took ship at Aberdeen for Denmark ; intending, as he said, to pass through Poland into Italy.2 Scarcely had they departed, when intelligence of Bothwell reached court. To so miserable a state was he reduced, that he had been seen skulking near Perth with only two followers, meanly clad, and in utter destitution.

Here all was out of joint. The court was divided into factions. The queen, of whose religious orthodoxy great doubts began now to be entertained, hated Mar, who was still intrusted with the person and government of the young prince ; a charge which, she insisted, belonged natu- rally to her.2 The king supported Mar against his great rival the Chancellor Maitland, a man full of talent, of inordinate ambition, and, as we have already seen, unscrupulous, intriguing, and familiar with con- spiracy and blood. Maitland strengthened himself against his enemies by courting the favour of the queen, who had at first treated all his advances with haughty suspicion ; but latterly, dreading his strength, or conciliated by his proffered devotion, supported his faction, which included Buccleuch, Cessford, the Master of Glammis, and other powerful barons. The potent house of Hamilton affected neutrality ; whilst the ministers of the Kirk also kept themselves aloof, and exerted their whole energies to procure the abso- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bothwell to Douglas, 17th June, 1595. 2 Ibid.

This James wisely refused. Enough, he thought, had already been done for the safety of the Protestant faith ; and to cut up by the roots the ancient houses of Angus, Huntley, and Errol ; to punish, by utter ruin and extermina tion, those who were already exiles for conscience' sake, would have been cruel and impolitic. To Both well, indeed, who had repeatedly conspired against his life, he showed no mercy ; aud his great estates were divided between Hume, Cessford, and Buccleuch.1 But the Countesses of Huntley and Errol were per mitted to remain in Scotland, and matters so managed that their unfortunate lords should not be utterly destitute. The principle of James was to balance the different factions against each other, keeping all dependent on himself, and throwing his weight occa sionally into the one or the other scale, as he judged best. The probable restoration, therefore, of such great men as Huntley, was a useful threat to hold over the heads of their rivals. But with all his policy, the monarch found his position dangerous and difficult. The court and country were full of in flammable materials ; and in such a state of things, events apparently trifling might produce a general convulsion. So at least thought Nicolson, the English resident at Edinburgh, on the occurrence of an event which, to feudal ears, sounded trifling enough. David Forrester, a retainer of Mar, and bailiff of Stirling, when riding from Edinburgh to that town, was, on some love-quarrel, waylaid and murdered by the Laird of Dunipace,2 assisted by the Bruces and the Living- 1 MS.

Mar instantly accepted this as a defiance ; assembled a body of six hundred horse ; vowed a deadly revenge ; and interdicting the body from being buried, carried it along with him, displaying before it, on two spears, a ghastly picture of Forrester, all mangled and bleed ing as he had died. In this way the earl, in his steel jack, and his men armed to the teeth, carried his murdered vassal in a bravado through the lands of the Livingstones and Bruces, which lay near Linlith gow, on the road between Edinburgh and Stirling; dividing his little force into three wards, and expect ing a ruffle with Buccleuch and Cessford, who were reported to be mustering their friends. But the peremptory remonstrances of the king prevented an immediate collision ; and a \" day of law,\" as it was then termed, was appointed for the trial of Forrester's slaughter.1 James's labour to preserve peace was, indeed, inces sant ; and but for his vigour and courage, the various factions would have torn the country in pieces. The chancellor had now gained to his side the powerful assistance of the house of Hamilton ; so that his strength was almost irresistible. With his strength, however, increased the odium and unpopularity of his measures. It was now well known that he had been the chief assistant of Huntley in the murder of Moray : he was branded as a hypocrite, all smiles and pro fessions upon the seat of justice, but deep, bloody, and unscrupulous when off it ; expressing great love to the Kirk and the ministers, yet careless of practical religion ; humble and devoted, as he said, to his sove reign, yet really so haughty, that he did not hesitate 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Bowes, 12th July, 1595.

It was this which provoked Mar, Argyle, and the rest of the ancient earls. On one occasion James, observing Maitland's de fiance, took him roundly to task ; reminding him that he was but his creature, a man of yesterday, a cadet of a mean house compared with Mar, who had a dozen vassals for his one;1 and that it ill became him to enter into proud speeches, or compare himself with the old nobles, and raise factions with Glammis and the queen against the master to whom he owed all. Pasquils, too, and biting epigrams, prognosticating some fatal end, were found pinned to his seat in the court.2 But Maitland was naturally courageous, and believed himself powerful enough to keep head against the worst. Hamilton, Hume, Fleming, Livingstone, Buccleuch, Cessford, with the Master of Glammis, had now joined him against Mar ; and the queen, finding herself thus supported, renewed her efforts to obtain possession of the young prince. The king was inexorable. He had been heard to swear that, were he on his death-bed and speechless, his last sign should be, that Mar should have the boy ; and the queen, in despair, took to bed and pretended a mortal sickness. James shut his ears when the news was brought him, and declared it all a trick. At last the lady, between anger and the agitation incident to her situation, for she was about to be confined, fell truly sick. The Mistress of Ochiltree, and a jury of matrons, sat upon her malady, and pronounced it no counterfeit; and James, in real alarm, hurried from Falkland.

She renewed her clamour for the keeping of the prince : he upbraided her for leaguing with such desperate men as Buccleuch and Cessford, who, in truth, at that moment, were plotting to restrain his person, seize the heir of the throne, and arraign his governor, one of the most faithful of his nobles, of high treason. To humour her would have been the extremity of weakness, and only play ing his enemies' game, who, he said, should find that, though he loved her, he could keep his purpose and be master in his own kingdom.1 This resolute temper saved the monarch. The chancellor controlled Buc cleuch, who alleged that they were throwing away their best opportunity : now they could seize the king ; next day they themselves might be in fetters. All was ready : the king, the prince, the government, by one bold stroke might be their own. But Mait land's heart failed, or his loyalty revived. He forbade the enterprise. James rode back to Falkland ; and when he next visited Edinburgh, his strength was such that he could defy his enemies.2 The ministers of the Kirk, scandalized by the divisions in the royal family, now remonstrated with the queen, awakened her to a higher sense of her conjugal duties, and con vinced her, that to renounce all factions, and follow the commands of her royal husband, was her only 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Bowes, 26th July, 1595.

From a paper written in the end of the year 1593, by one of his northern cor respondents,1 it appears that the Isles could, on any emergency, fit out a force of six thousand hardy troops, inured to danger both by sea and land, and equips for war on either element. Of these, two thousand wore defensive armour, actons, habergeons, and knapsculls ;2 the rest were bowmen or pikemen ; but many, adds the island statist, had now become harquebusiers. This force, it is to be observed, was independent of those left at home to labour the ground ; the whole of the Isles being different from the rest of feudal Scotland in one essential respect, \"that they who occupied the ground, were not charged to the wars.\" 3 Of this western archipelago, the principal islands were Lewis and Skye, lying to the north, Islay and Mull to the south ; and amongst the chief leaders who assumed the state and independence of little princes, were the Earl of Argyle, Lauchlan Maclean of Duart, 1 MS.

JAMES VI. 297 Angus Macdonald of Dunyveg, Donald Gorm Mac donald of Sleat, and Roderick Macleod of Harris, known in traditionary song as Ruari Mor.1 Of these chiefs, the Lord of Duart, commonly called Lauchlan Mor, was by far the most talented and conspicuous ; and, as Elizabeth well knew, had the power of bridling or letting loose that formidable body of troops which Donald Gorm and Ruari Mor were now collecting to assist her enemies in Ireland. Lauchlan Mor was, in all respects, a remarkable person ; by no means illite rate, for he had received his nurture in the low country, and had married a daughter of the Earl of Glencairn. But in war and personal prowess he had then no equal : an island Amadis of colossal strength and stature ; and possessing, by the vigour of his natural talents, a commanding influence over the rude and fierce isles men. It is curious to trace Elizabeth's connexion with this man. The Lord of Duart's confidential servant happened to be a certain shrewd Celt, named John Achinross ; he, in turn, was connected by marriage with Master John Cunningham, a worthy citizen and merchant in Edinburgh. This honest bailie of the capital, forming the link between savage and civilized life, corresponded with Sir Robert Bowes ; Bowes with Burghley or Sir Robert Cecil ; and thus Eliza beth, sitting in her closet at Windsor or Greenwich, moved the strings which could assemble or disperse the chivalry of the Isles. This is no ideal picture, for the letters of the actors remain. As early as March, 1 594-5, Achinross informed Bowes that Mac lean and Argyle were ready, not only to stay the clan Donnell, who, under Donald Gorm, were then mustering to assist Tyrone ; but that Maclean him- 1 Gregory's History of the Western Highlands and Isles of Scotland, p. 261."], [304, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1595. 298 self would join the English army in Ireland, if Eliza beth would despatch three or four ships to keep his galleys whilst they attacked the enemy.1 As the summer came on, and the fleet of Donald and his associates waited only for a fair wind, Cunningham hurried to the Isles, had a conference with Maclean, and thence rode post to London, where, in an inter view with Sir Robert Cecil, he urged the necessity of instant action and assistance.2 The bridle which the Laird of Duart held over the Islesmen was simple enough ; being a garrison of six hundred mercenaries, well armed, and ready to be led by him, on a moment's warning, against any island chief who embarked in foreign service, and left his lands undefended at home.3 The support of this force, however, required funds : Elizabeth demurred ; Maclean was obliged to disband his men ; and the most part of the fleet weighed anchor, and bore away for Ireland.4 It consisted of a hundred sail, of which fifty were galleys, the rest smaller craft ; and the number of soldiers and mari ners was estimated at about five thousand.5 Nine hundred men, however, under the Captain of the clau Ranald,6 still remained ; and as they passed Mull had the temerity to land for the night ; running their \" galleys, boats, and birlings,\" into a little harbour, where they imagined themselves secure.

She wrote, at the same time, to the Earl of Argyle ; 3 flattered him by some rich token of her regard ; and ordered Nicolson, her resident at the Scottish court, to deliver it and her letter to him in person, at Dunoon in Argyle.

This sudden arrival, and as sudden disappearance of the fleet of the Islesmen, appears to have puzzled the chroniclers of the times, and even their more acute modern successor. A black cloud had been seen to gather over Ireland ; and men waited in stilness for the growl of the thunder and the sweep of the tempest, when it melted into air, and all was once more tran quillity. This seemed unaccountable, almost miracu lous ; but the letters of honest John Cunningham, and his Celtic relative Achinross, whose epistles smack so strongly of his Gaelic original, introduce us behind the scenes, and discover Lauchlan Mor as the secret agent, the Celtic Prospero, whose wand dis persed the galleys, and restored serenity to the ocean. The reader may be pleased with an extract from a letter of this brave Lord of Duart to Sir R. Bowes, although his style is a little ponderous, and by no means so polished as the Danish steel axe with which it was his delight to hew down his enemies : he is alluding to the future plan of the campaign intended by Tyrone and O'Donnell against Elizabeth, and the best way to defeat it. \" The earl is to pursue you on one side, and O'Don nell is to pursue your lands presently on the other side.

The Chan cellor Maitland lord Thirlstane, had now, for some years, ruled the court and the country with a firm, unchallenged, and, as many thought, a haughty supe riority. He had given mortal offence to the queen ; had provoked the hostility of the highest nobles of the land; and, it was whispered, was more feared than 1 Hamely, familiar. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Lauchlan Maclean of Duart, to Sir R.

But he had kept his ground ; partly by superiority in practical business talents to all his competitors; partly by that deep political sagacity and foresight which made Burghley pronounce him the \" wisest man in Scotland ; \" and not least of all, by that high personal courage and somewhat unscrupulous familiarity with conspiracy, and even with blood, which blotted most men of this semi-barbarous age. He had, besides, been a pretty consistent Protestant ; and although in earlier years he had attacked some of Knox's political tenets, yet recently, the strong and decided part he had adopted against Huntley and the Catholic earls made him a favourite with the ministers of the Kirk. So resist less had he now become, that the queen and her friends had renounced all opposition, and joined his faction against Mar the governor of the prince, the favourite of his royal master, and one of the oldest and most powerful of the higher nobles.1 In this his palmy state, when plotting new schemes of ambition, and inflaming the king against the queen ; meeting Cess ford and Buccleuch, and his other associates, in night \"Trysts;\"' marshalling secretly his whole strength, and laying a \" platt,\" as it was then called, or conspi racy against Mar, by which he hoped to hurl him from his height of power, and rule unchecked over his sovereign ; he was suddenly seized with a mortal dis temper.3 At first he struggled fiercely against it, tried to throw it off, rode restlessly from place to place, and appeared so active that it was currently said the sickness was only one of his old pretences ; 1 MS.

James resisted repeated mes sages ; it was even said he had whispered in a courtier's ear, that it would be a small matter if the chancellor were hanged ; and when Robert Bruce, one of the leading ministers, rode at four in the morning to Thirlstane, he found the dying statesman full of penitence for neglected opportunities, imploring the prayers of the Kirk, and promising to make many discoveries of strange matters if God granted him time for amendment and reformation.1 What ap peared to weigh heaviest on his conscience, was the part he had acted in sowing dissension between the king and queen ; and he seemed much shaken by fears that many dark dealings would come out on this subject. He expressed sorrow, also, for his \" partial information against John Knox, and other good men;\" and when asked what advice he would leave to the king for the management of his estate, shook his head, observing, \" it was too late speer'd,\" 2 as his thoughts were on another world. Even his enemies, who had quoted against him the Italian adage, \" II periculo passato, il santo gabato,\" rejoiced at last to find that the sickness was no counterfeit ; and were little able to restrain their satisfaction when news arrived at court that the chancellor was no more. He died at Thirlstane on the night of the 3d October ; and John Colvile, his bitter enemy, exultingly wrote 1 MS. State-paper Office, 10th September, 1595, Advertisements from Scotland. Ibid.

At court the competitors for the chancellor's place were busy, bitter, and clamorous ; in the Kirk the ministers gave warning that the Catholic earls, now in banishment, had been plotting their return, and that the Spaniards were on the eve of invading England and Scotland with a mighty force.3 It was absolutely necessary, they said, that the Kirk should have authority to convene the people in arms, to resist the threatened danger ; and that an ambassador should be sent to England to arrange some plan of common defence.4 James at once consented to the first pro posal, and gave immediate directions for the defence of the country ; but he refused to send an ambassador to Elizabeth, who had rejected his suits and broken her promises, although he had preferred her friendship 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 8th Oct. 1595, Nicolson to Bowes.

He was, at this moment, he said, ready to act as her lieutenant against the Spaniards, and perish with England in defence of the true religion.1 Yet still she withheld her supplies, and treated him with sus- picion, notwithstanding the proofs he was daily giving of his sincerity in religion, and although she knew him to be drowned in debt. For this last assertion \u2014 the dreadful embarrassment of his finances, there was too good ground ; and it had been long apparent that, unless some thorough reform took place* matters must come to an extremity. The office of treasurer was held by the Master of Glammis, a man of great power, and one of the chief friends of the late chancellor. Sir Robert Mel vii was his deputy; Seton laird of Parbreath, filled the office of comptroller ; and Douglas, the pro- vost of Glenclouden, that of collector. All of them had been protected by Thirlstane during his supremacy in the council ; and, it was suspected by the king, had fattened at the royal expense. This idea was encou- raged by the queen, who now lived on the most loving terms with her lord, and omitted no opportunity to point out the rapid diminution of the crown revenues, and the contrast between her own command of money, out of so small a dowery as she enjoyed, and the reduced and beggarly condition of the household and palaces of her royal consort. On New Year's Day, coming playfully to the king, she shook a purse full of gold in his face, and bade him accept it as her gift. He asked where she got it. \" From my councillors,\" she replied, \" who have but now given me a thousand pieces in a purse: when will yours do the like?\" \u2014 \"Never,\" said the king ; and calling instantly for his collector 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Bowes, 27th Nov. 1595.

These were Seton lord Urquhart, president of the Session ; Mr. John Lindsay, Mr. John Elphinstone, and Mr. Thomas Hamilton ; to whom James com mitted the entire management of his revenues and household. It was soon found that the charge would be too laborious for so small a number, and four others were added : the Prior of Blantyre, Skene the clerk register, Sir David Carnegie, and Mr. Peter Young, master-almoner. These new officers sat daily in the Upper Tolbooth, and from their number were called Octavians. They acted without salary; held their commissions under the king's hand alone ; and by the vigour, good sense, and orderly arrangements which they adopted, promised a speedy and thorough refor mation of all financial abuses.1 Elizabeth now deemed it necessary to send Sir Robert Bowes once more as her ambassador to Scot land. He had been recalled from that court, or rather suffered, at his own earnest entreaty, to return to England, as far back as October 1594- ;2 and since that time to the present, (January 1595-6,) the corre spondence with England, and the political interests of that kingdom, had been intrusted to Mr. George Nicol son, who had long acted as Bowes's secretary; and who, from the time that this minister left Edinburgh till his return to the Scottish court, kept up an almost daily correspondence with him. Elizabeth instructed Bowes to assure James of her unalterable friendship, but of the impossibility of advancing a single shilling, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Bowes, 7th Jan. 1595-6.

JAMES VI. 307 drained as she was by her assistance to France, with out which Henry must have lost his throne ; her war in Ireland ; and her preparations against Spain, which, at that instant, had fitted out a more mighty armament against her than the armada of 1588. The ambassador was intrusted not only with a letter from the English queen to James, but with a letter and message to Queen Anne, whom he was to greet with every ex pression of friendship, and to reproach mildly for her reserve in not communicating to Elizabeth the secret history of the late quarrels between her and her royal husband, regarding the government and keeping of the young prince. He was also to touch on a still more delicate subject \u2014 the reports which had reached the court of England of her change of religion ; and to warn her that, although his mistress utterly dis believed such a slander, she could not be too much on her guard against the crafty men who were in com munication with the pope, and eager to seduce her to their errors.1 Bowes's reception by James was gra cious and cordial. The king declared his satisfaction in hearing that his good sister was so well prepared against the meditated invasion of the Spaniard, and his own readiness to hazard all \u2014 life, crown, and kingdom, in her defence and his own ; but he reminded Bowes of Lord Zouch's arguments and unfulfilled promises; and whilst he spoke feelingly of his pecuniary embarrassments, and the impossi bility of raising soldiers without funds, he hinted significantly, that the pope and the Catholic earls threw about their gold pieces with an open hand ; and did not conceal that large offers had been made to draw him to the side of Spain, although he had no 1 MS.

Bowes assured the king that this famous work, which made so much noise at the time, was written not in England but in Spain, by Persons, an English Jesuit and traitor ; but James retained his scepticism.1 The ambassador next sought the queen, and was soon on very intimate and confidential terms with this princess, who expressed herself highly gratified by Elizabeth's letter. Nothing, she said, could give her greater delight than to receive such assurances of kindness and affection ; and she would readily follow her advice, as of one whom she most honoured, loved, and trusted ; but as to the delicate subject of the late differences between her aud the king, and her wish to get the prince into her hands, the matter had been so sudden, and full of peril, that she dared not send either letter or message to the Queen of England. She then threw the blame of the whole on the late chancellor ; who had acted, she said, with great base ness, both towards herself and the king. It was he had first moved her to get the prince out of Mar's hands ; it was he who animated the king against her, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Lord Burghley, Feb. 24, 1595-6."], [315, "1595-6.

Had he come, he must have been made captive, and would have remained in captivity.\" \" These secrets,\" said Bowes, in his letter to Eliza beth, \".she desired to be commended by my letters to your majesty's only hands, view, and secrecy ; and that none other should know the same.\" As to her reported change of religion, the queen frankly ad mitted that attempts had been made for her conversion to Rome ; but all had now passed and failed : she remained a Protestant ; and would rather not reveal the names of the practisers. If they again assaulted her religion, Elizabeth should know who they were, and how she had answered them.1 The continuance of the rebellion in Ireland, and the intrigues of Tyrone with the Western Isles, had greatly annoyed Elizabeth : and Bowes was ordered to communicate with the king, and with Maclean of Duart, on the subject. He found that James had resolved to adopt speedily some decided measures to bring the Isles into order ; and hoped to succeed by employing in this service the Earl of Argyle, Mac lean, and Mackenzie, to whose sister Maclean had lately married his eldest son. The ambassador had been, as usual, tutored to spare his mistress's purse, whilst he sounded Maclean's \" mind, power, and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to the Queen, Feb. 24, 1595-6."], [316, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1595-6. 310 resolution;''1 and exerted himself to the utmost to drive a hard bargain. He was alarmed, too, with the din of warlike preparations then sounding through the western archipelago : Donald Gorm was mustering his men, and repairing his galleys ; Macleod of Harris had lately landed from Ireland, and was ready to re turn with fresh power ; and Angus Maconnel, another potent chief, was assembling his galleys and soldiers.2 Maclean himself was in Tiree, then reckoned ten days' journey from Edinburgh ; and Argyle, so intent in investigating the murder of Campbell of Calder, now traced to Campbell of Ardkinglass, that Bowes could have no immediate transactions with either. He set, however, Cunningham and Achinross, his former agents, to work ; and when these active emissaries got amongst the Highlanders, the storm of letters, memorials, contracts, queries, answers, and estimates, soon poured down on the unhappy head of Bowes, who implored Cecil, but with small success, to send him instructions, and some portion of treasure, to satisfy Elizabeth's Celtic auxiliaries, who clamoured for gold. Maclean was perfectly ready, as before, to attack Tyrone ; and confident that the plan of the campaign, which he had already communicated, if carried into vigorous effect, would reduce the great rebel. But he made it imperative on the queen to furnish two thousand soldiers, and advance a month's pay to his men. He himself, he said, had neither spared \" gear nor pains in the service ; and yet her majesty's long promised present of a thousand crowns 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Sir R.

JAMES VI. 311 had not yet arrived.\"1 These remonstrances produced the effect desired. Elizabeth was shamed into some settlement of her promises ; and Maclean, with his island chivalry, declared himself ready to obey her majesty's orders with all promptitude and fidelity.2 The ambassador speedily discovered, that the eighteen months during which he had been absent, had added both energy and wisdom to James's character. It was evident there was more than empty compli ment in Nicolson's observation \u2014 that in severity he began to rule like a king. There was still, indeed, about him much that was frivolous, undignified, and capricious; much favouritism, much extravagance, an extraordinary love of his pleasures, and a passion for display in oratory, poetry, theology, and scholastic disputation, which was frequently ridiculous ; but with all this, he was dreaded by his nobles, and com pelled respect and obedience. As Elizabeth advanced to old age, his eye became steadily fixed on the Eng lish crown, which he considered his undoubted right ; and the one great engrossing object of his policy was to secure it. His fairest chance, he thought, to gain the respect and good wishes of the English people, when death took from them their own great princess, was to show that he knew how to rule over his own unruly subjects. Hence his vigorous determination to restrain, by every possible means, the power of the greater nobility ; to recruit his exhausted finances ; to reduce the Isles, and consolidate his kingdom ; and to bridle the claims of the Kirk, in all matters of civil government, or interference with the royal preroga- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 24th Feb. 1595-6.

Not long after Bowes's arrival, the convention of the General Assembly met in Edinburgh ; and the king, then absent on a hunting expedition, broke off his sport, and returned to Holyrood, that he might \" honour the Kirk (as Bowes observed) with his pre sence and his oration.\" The moderator, Mr. Robert Pont, warmly welcomed the royal party ; which embraced the Duke of Lennox, Lord Hamilton, the Earls of Argyle, Mar, and Orkney : and addressing the king, thanked him in name of the Assembly for his presence ; reminding him of the honour obtained by Constantine in favouring the ancient fathers of the Church, and by David in dancing before the ark. In reply, James professed his zeal for religion since his youth up. He had ever esteemed it, as he de clared, more glory to be a Christian than a king, whatever slanders to the contrary were spoken against him. It was this zeal which moved him to convene the present Assembly : for being aware of the designs of Spain, their great enemy, against religion and this isle, he was anxious to meet, not only the ministry, but the barons and gentlemen, to receive their advice, and resolve on measures to resist the common enemy. Two points he would press on them \u2014 reformation and preparation : the reformation of themselves, clergy, people, and king. For his own part, he never refused admonition : he was ever anxious to be told his faults ; and his chamber door should never be closed to any minister who reproved him. All he begged was, that they would first speak privately before they arraigned him in open pulpit. He hated the common vice of ambition ; but of one thing he was really ambitious \u2014"], [319, "JAMES VI. 1596. 313 to have the name of James the Sixth honoured as the establisher of religion, and the provider of livings for the ministry throughout his whole dominions. And now, as to his second point, preparation against the common enemy, one thing was clear \u2014 they must have paid troops ; the country must be put to charges : the times were changed since their forefathers fol lowed each his lord or his laird to Pinkie field ; a confused multitude, incapable of discipline, and an easy prey to regular soldiers, as the event of that miserable day could testify. Of how many great names had it been the wreck and ruin ! Since then the fashion and art of war had entirely altered ; and he protested it was a shame that Scotland should be lying in careless security, whilst all other countries were up and in arms.1 This speech gave great satisfaction to the minis ters ; and their joy was increased by a message brought to them soon after by Mr. John Preston and Mr. Edward Bruce, intimating the king's resolution to have the whole kirks in Scotland supplied with ministers, and endowed with sufficient stipends. He requested the Kirk to cause their commissioners to meet with those councillors and officers whom he had appointed for this purpose, and to fix upon some plan for carrying his resolution into effect.

Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch, a baron of proud temper, undaunted courage, and considered one of the ablest military leaders in Scotland, was at this time warden of the west marches ; having for his brother warden of England, Lord Scrope, also a brave and experienced officer. Scrope's deputy was a gentleman of the name of Salkeld; Buccleuch's, a baron of his own clan, Robert Scott of Haining : and in the absence of the principals, it was the duty of these subordinate officers to hold the warden courts for the punishment of outlaws and offenders. Such courts presented a curious spectacle : for men met in perfect peace and security, protected by the law of the borders, which made it death for any Englishman or Scotsman to draw weapon upon his greatest foe, from the time of holding the court till next morning at sunrise. It was judged that, in this interval, all might return home ; and it is easy to see that, with such a popula tion as that of the borders, nothing but the most rigid enforcement of this law could save the country from perpetual rapine and murder.

He was himself a man of great personal strength and stature ; and had four sons, Jock, Francie, Geordie, and Sandie Armstrong, each of them a braver and more successful moss-trooper than the other. Their exploits had made them known and dreaded over the whole district ; and their father and they had more \" bills filed \" against them at the warden courts, more personal quarrels and family feuds to keep their blood hot and their hands on their weapons, than any twenty men in Liddesdale. This Willie of Kinmont, who was a retainer of Buccleuch and a special favourite of his chief, had been attending a warden court, held by the English and Scottish deputy wardens, at a place named the Dayholm of Kershope, where a small burn or rivulet divides the two countries, and was quietly returning home through Liddesdale, with three or four in company, when he was suddenly attacked by a body of two hundred English borderers, chased for some miles, captured, tied to a horse, and carried in triumph to Carlisle castle ; where Lord Scrope the governor and warden cast him, heavily ironed, into the common prison. Such an outrageous violation of border law was instantly complained of by Buccleuch, who wrote repeatedly to Lord Scrope, demanding the release of his follower ; and receiving no satisfactory reply, swore that he would bring Kinmont Willie out of Carlisle castle, quick or dead, with his own hand.1 The threat was esteemed a mere bravado ; for the castle was strongly garrisoned and well fortified, in the middle of 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

Yet Buccleuch was not intimidated. Choosing a dark tempestuous night, (the 13th of April,) he assembled two hundred of his bravest men at the Tower of Mor ton, a fortalice on \"the debateable land,\" on the water of Sark, about ten miles from Carlisle. Amongst these, the leader whom he most relied on was Wat Scott of Harden ; but along with him were Wat Scott of Branxholm, Wat Scott of Goldielands, Jock Elliot of the Copshaw, Sandie Armstrong, son to Hobbie the Laird of Mangerton, Kinmont's four sons \u2014 Jock, Francie, Sandie, and Geordie Armstrong, Rob of the Langholm, and Willie Bell the Redcloak ; all noted and daring men. They were well mounted, armed at all points, and carried with them scaling-ladders, be sides iron crowbars, sledge-hammers, hand-picks, and axes. Thus furnished, and favoured by the extreme darkness of the night, they passed the river Esk ; rode briskly through the Grahames' country ; forded the Eden, then swollen over its banks ; and came to the brook Caday, close by Carlisle, where Buccleuch made his men dismount, and silently led eighty of them, with the ladders and iron tools, to the foot of the wall of the base or outer court of the castle. Every thing favoured them : the heavens were as black as pitch, the rain descended in torrents; and as they raised their ladders to fix them on the cope-stone, they could hear the English sentinels challenge as they walked their rounds. To their rage and disappointment, the ladders proved too short ; but finding a postern in the wall, they undermined it, and soon made a breach enough for a soldier to squeeze through. In this way a dozen stout fellows passed iuto the outer court, (Buccleuch himself being the fifth man who"], [324, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 318 entered,1) disarmed and bound the watch, wrenched open the postern from the inside, and thus admitting their companions, were masters of the place. Twenty four troopers now rushed to the castle jail, Buccleuch meantime keeping the postern, forced the door of the chamber where Kinmont was confined, carried him off in his irons, and sounding their trumpet, the signal agreed on, were answered by loud shouts and the trumpet of Buccleuch, whose troopers filled the base court. All was now terror and confusion, both in town and castle. The alarum-bell rang, and was answered by his brazen brethren of the cathedral and the town-house ; the beacon blazed up on the top of the great tower ; and its red, uncertain glare on the black sky aud the shadowy forms and glancing armour of the borderers, rather increased the horror and their numbers. None could see their enemy or tell his real strength. Lord Scrope, believing, as he afterwards wrote to Burghley, that five hundred Scots were in possession of the castle, kept himself close within his chamber. Kinmont Will himself, as he was carried on his friends' shoulders beneath the warden's window, roared out a lusty \" Good night \" to his lordship ; and in a wonderfully brief space Buccleuch had effected his purpose, joined his men on the Caday, remounted his troopers, forded once more the Esk and the Eden, and bearing his rescued favourite in the middle of his little band, regained the Scottish border before sunrise. This brilliant exploit, the last and assuredly one of the bravest feats of border warfare, wTas long talked of; embalmed in an inimitable ballad; and fondly dwelt on by tradition, which has preserved some graphic touches.

His master, Buccleuch, eager to rid him of these shackles, halted at the first smith's house they came to within the Scottish border ; but the door was locked, the family in bed, and the knight of the hammer so sound a sleeper, that he was only wakened by the lord warden thrusting his long spear through the wiudow, and nearly spitting both Vulcan and his lady.1 Jocular, however, as were these circumstances to the victors, the business was no laughing matter to Lord Scrope, who came forth from his bed-chamber to find that his castle had been stormed, his garrison bearded, and his prisoner carried off by only eighty men. He instantly wrote to the privy-council and Lord Burghley, complaining of so audacious an attack upon one of the queen's castles in time of peace ; and advising his royal mistress to insist with James on the delivery of Buccleuch, that he might receive the punishment which so audacious an outrage, as he termed it, deserved. But Buccleuch had much to offer in his defence ; he pleaded that Kinmont's seizure and imprisonment had been a gross violation of the law ; that it was not until every possible representation had failed, and till his own sovereign's remonstrance, addressed to Elizabeth, had been treated with con tempt, that he took the matter into his own hands ; and that his borderers had committed no outrage, either on life or property, although they might have made Scrope and his garrison prisoners, aud sacked 1 Contemporary Account in the Warrender MSS.; and MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

At? early as May, Bowes had detected the incipient movement in favour of the banished earls, and their reaolution to petition the king for their return.2 They were to make submis sion to the king and the church, and to have their cause espoused by the Duke of Lennox. Not long after, the Earl of Huntley landed from the Continent at Eyemouth ; and passing in disguise into Scotland, encountered on his road the Lord St. Colm, whose brother he had slain. Fortunately for the returned exile, his mean dress concealed him from the vengeance of his enemy, and he arrived safely amongst his friends; who, aware of the court intrigues in his favour, exerted their utmost efforts to procure his restoration. But these were met by cries of horror and warning from the Kirk, which increased to their loudest note when it was reported that Errol had been seen with Huntley at his castle, the Bog of Gicht, and that Angus had dared to come secretly into Perth, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Burghley to Sir Robert Cecil, 10th July, 1596, addressed, \" To my lovying son.\" 2 Ibid.

He had never, he said, held any traffic with any individuals whatever, against the reformed religion, since his leaving Scotland, and was ready to abide his trial, if any one dared to accuse him. He was ready, also, to banish from his company all seminary priests and known Papists ; and would willingly hold conference on the subject of religion with any ministers of the Kirk, by whose arguments he might possibly be induced to embrace their religion. He would receive, he added, any Presbyterian pastor into his house for his belter instruction ; would sup port him at his own expense ; wTould assist the Kirk with his utmost power in the maintenance of their discipline, and only required, in return, that a reason able time should be given him to be satisfied in his conscience ; and that, meanwhile, he should be ab solved from the heavy sentence of excommunication which had been pronounced against him.2 Nothing could be more moderate than such requests ; but the Kirk fired at the very idea that an excommu nicated traitor, as they termed the earl, who had been guilty of idolat;y, a crime punishable by death, and who, in the face of his sentence of banishment, had dared, without license, to return, should have the hardihood to propose any terms whatever.

To remedy or avert these evils, a day of humiliation was appointed to be observed with more than ordinary rigour; in which the people and the ministry were called upon to weep between the porch and the altar, for a land polluted by the enemies of God, and threatened with the loss of his favour. A body of sixteen commissioners was selected from the ministers, who were to sit monthly at Edinburgh, under the name of the \" Council of the Church:\" their duty was to provide, according to the ancient phrase, \" Ne quid Ecclesia detrimenti caperet ; \" and through them a constant correspondence was kept up with all parts of the realm.1 These proceedings alarmed the king, who could see no good grounds for the erection of so formidable a machinery against what he deemed an imaginary at tack, and directed some members of his privy-council to hold a meeting with the more moderate ministers, and persuade them of the groundlessness of their apprehensions. If, he said, the three earls were repentant ; if they had already suffered exile and were solicitous to hear the truth and return to their country and the bosom of the church, why should he, their prince, be precluded from the exercise of mercy, the brightest jewel in his prerogative? and why, above all, should the church, whose doors ought ever to stand open to returning penitents, shut them remorselessly in their faces, and consign them to darkness and despair ? 1 Spottiswood, p. 4IR."], [330, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 324 These sentiments of the king were as politic as they were merciful ; for in the present state of the king dom, considering Elizabeth's advanced age and the power of the Roman Catholics in England as well as in his own dominions, nothing could have been more unfavourable to his title of succession than to have become a religious persecutor. Indeed, the arguments of the more violent amongst the ministers were revolt ing and absurd. The crime of which the Catholic earls had been guilty (so they reasoned) was of that atrocious nature which rendered pardon by the civil power im possible. They were idolaters, and must die the death ; though, upon repentance, they might be absolved by the Kirk from the sentence of spiritual death.1 Such a merciless mode of reasoning, proceeding, as Spottis wood has remarked, rather from \" passion than any good zeal,\" greatly disgusted the king ; who perceived that, under the alleged necessity of watching over the purity of the faith, the Kirk were erecting a tribunal independent alike of the law and the throne. Nor did James conceal these sentiments ; inveighing bitterly against the ministers, both in public and private, at council and table. It was in vain that some of the brethren (for here, as in all other popular factions, there was a more moderate party, who were dragged forward and hustled into excesses by the more vio lent) entreated him to explain the causes of his offence, and declared their anxiety for an agreement. \" As to agreement,\" said the monarch, \" never will there he an agreement as long as the limits of the two jurisdic tions, the civil and the ecclesiastical, are so vague and undistinguishable.

To think of agreement under such circumstances is vain ; even if made, it could not last for a moment.\"1 In the midst of all this, and when the feelings of the king and the clergy were in a state of high ex citement, Mr. David Black, one of the ministers of St. Andrews, a fierce Puritan, delivered a discourse in which he not only animadverted on the threatened triumph of idolatry at home, but raised his voice against the Prelacy which had established itself in the neighbouring kingdom. The Queen of England, he said, was an atheist ; the religion professed in that kingdom nothing better than an empty show, guided by the injunctions of the bishops ; and not content with this pageant at home, they were now persuading the king to set it up in Scotland. As for his highness, none knew better than he did of the meditated return of these Papist earls ; and herein he was guilty of manifest treachery. But what could they look for ? Was not Satan the head of both court and council ? Were not all kings devil's bairns ? Was not Satan in the court, in the guiders of the court, in the head of the court ? Were not the lords of Session mis creants and bribers, the nobility cormorants, and the Queen of Scotland a woman whom, for fashion's sake, 1 Spottiswood, p. 419."], [332, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 326 they might pray for, but in whose time it was vain to hope for good?1 This insolent attack was followed, as might have been expected, by an indignant complaint of Bowes the English ambassador; and the offender was im mediately cited to appear before the privy-council. To obey this summons, however, would have been construed into an abandonment of the highest privi leges of the Kirk; and Black at once declined the jurisdiction of the tribunal. His \"Declinator\" is an extraordinary paper, and, by the high tone which it assumed, fully justified all the apprehensions of the king. \"Albeit,\" said he, addressing the king and council, \" I am ready, by the assistance of the grace of God, to give a confession, and to stand to the defence of every point of the truth of God, uttered by me, either by opening up of this word, or applica tion thereof, before your majesty or council; * * yet, seeing 1 am brought at this time to stand before your majesty and council, as a judge set to cognosce and discern upon my doctrine, wherethrough my answering to the said pretended accusation might import with the manifest prejudice of the liberties of the Kirk, and acknowledging also of your majesty's jurisdiction in matters that are mere spiritual, which might move your majesty to attempt farther in the spiritual government of the Kirk of God : * * Therefore (so he continued) I am constrained, in all humility and submission of mind, to use a declinature of the judgment, at least in prima instantia, for the following reasons : First, the Lord Jesus, the God of order and not of confusion, as appeared most evidently 1 MS.

It con firmed him, also, in his resolution to extend his favour to the Catholic earls, upon their due submission ; and at all hazards to put down that spirit of dictation and interference which might have soon made the tyranny and license of the ministers intolerable. Having understood, therefore, that a copy of Mr. Black's declinature had been sent by the commissioners of the Kirk to the various presbyteries throughout the king dom for their signature, with letters commending the cause to their assistance and prayers, James at once construed this into an act of mutiny ; and by a public proclamation not only discharged the commissioners from holding any farther meetings, but commanded them to leave the capital and repair within twenty-four hours to their flocks.2 But this royal order they were in no temper to obey. They instantly convened, and, in the phrase used by their own historian, \" laid their letters open before the Lord.\"3 The danger, they declared, was imminent ; and the ministers of the city roust instantly, in their pulpits, deal mightily with the power of the Word against the charge which com manded them to desert their duty.

This accusation was indignantly repelled by Seton, the president of the Session ; and from him the com missioners of the Kirk repaired to the king; who assured them, with greater mildness than some had expected, that if Black would withdraw his \" Declina tor\" all could be well arranged : a proposal which the more moderate party in the Kirk anxiously advised to be adopted. \" At this moment,\" they said, \" the court stands in some awe of the Kirk ; and our wisest plan is to make the best conditions we can. If we measure our strength with the king, we shall be found too weak, and may lose the ground we have gained.\" But others, more fierce and zealous, arraigned such counsels as Erastian, and worldly-wise. To renounce the least of their privileges would, they argued, be the sure way to lose them all ; to stand to their ground the only way to prevail : it was God's cause ; and He who had the hearts of princes in His hand would maintain it.1 1 Calderwood, pp. 340, 341.

So anxious, however, was he to avoid extremities, that after the judges had pro nounced their opinion that the matters charged against him amounted, if proved, to treason, and were within the jurisdiction of the king and council, he deferred the trial till next day ; and in the interval sent for some of the ministers, with the hope that, even at this latest hour, some mutual concessions might lead to peace. It had been reported to him, he said, that they were in terror lest their spiritual jurisdiction should be invaded ; but nothing could be farther from his mind than any abridgment of the liberties of the Kirk ; and he was ready, by a public declaration on this point, to quiet their minds. \"But,\" he con tinued, \" this licentious manner of discoursing of affairs of state in the pulpit cannot be tolerated.

I have had good proof already what justice ye will do me ; and were this a doubtful case, where by any colour the speeches might be justified, there might be some excuse for saying the minister should be con victed by his brethren ; but here, what says Mr. Black ? ' All kings are devil's bairns ; the treachery of the king's heart is discovered.' Who sees not that this man hath passed his bounds ? Who will say he hath kept to his message ? \" It was easier to demur to this than to answer it ; and so convinced were the ministers at the moment of the reasonableness of the king's desires, that, after much conference and cavilling, they agreed to with draw from the contest, till the limits between the civil and spiritual jurisdictions should be discussed and decided in a lawful General Assembly. On his side, also, James relaxed in the rigour of his requisitions. He was content, he said, that Black should be brought to his presence ; and on his admission or denial of the truth of the accusations, be judged by three of his own brethren, \u2014 Mr. David Lindsay, Mr. James Nicolson, and Mr. Thomas Buchanan. Matters were now on the very eve of an amicable adjustment, when it was unfortunately suggested to the king, that by this mode of settlement he would compromise his dignity, and that of his consort, unless Mr. Black first acknowledged his offence against the queen.

The court before whom he had been tried had evinced the most shameless injustice ; had refused the most unexceptionable witnesses, who would have amply proved his innocence. Provost, bailies, rectors, deans, principals, and regents of col leges, had been ready to testify in his favour ; and the judges had admitted in their place the evidence of ignorant and partial persons, whom it was impossible to believe.

The depositions of the witnesses were then read ; and Black, in absence, was found guilty of having falsely and treasonably slandered the king, the queen his royal consort, his neighbour princess the Queen of England, and the lords of Council and Session. It was left to the king to name the due punishment for such offences ; but till the royal plea sure were known, he was sentenced to be confined beyond the North Water, and within six days to enter his person in ward.2 Yet although armed by this sentence, and holding the sword of the civil power over the heads of the guilty, James arrested its descent, and to the last showed an anxiety for a compromise. The punishment of Black, he said, should be of the lightest kind ; and no ministers 1 Calderwood, p. 351 . Spottiswood, p. 425. - Ibid. p. 427."], [339, "1596. JAMES VI. 333 should be called before the privy council till it had been found in a General Assembly that the king might judge whether they passed the bounds in doc trine. Meanwhile, the acts of council so obnoxious to the brethren should be deleted, the offensive pro clamations amended, and every reasonable safeguard provided against the alleged encroachments upon the liberties of the Kirk. These amicable feelings were unfortunately con strued rather into an admission of weakness than a desire for peace ; and the commissioners of the Kirk, sternly refusing to abate an atom of their demands, declared that no punishment could be inflicted on a man who had not yet been tried. On the other hand, it was urged by Seton, president of the Session, and one of the Octavians, that unless some punishment followed the sentence pronounced upon Black, the king could never make that process a good ground for claiming the jurisdiction over the ministers. The two antagonists, therefore, the Kirk and the crown, found themselves, after these protracted overtures, more mortally opposed to each other than before. The Kirk, protesting that every effort had failed to obtain redress for the wrongs offered to Christ's kingdom, proclaimed a fast ; commanded all faithful pastors to betake themselves to their spiritual armour ; caused \" the doctrine,\" to use the phrase of these times, \" to sound mightily ;\" and protested that, what ever might be the consequences, they were free of his majesty's blood.\" x The king received this announcement with the ut most scorn, commanded the commissioners instantly to depart the city, ordered Black to enter into ward, 1 Calderwood, pp. 356, 360. Spottiswood, p. 426."], [340, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 334 and published a declaration, in which he exposed, in forcible and indignant terms, the unreasonable de- mands of the Kirk. \" Out of an earnest desire,\" he said, \" to keep peace with the ministers, he had agreed to wave all inquiry into ' past causes,' till the unhappy differences between the civil and ecclesiastical tribunal had been removed by the judgment of a convention of estates and a General Assembly of the ministry. All that he had asked in return was, that his proceed- ings should not be made a subject of pulpit attack and bitter ecclesiastical railing : instead of listening to which request, they had vilified him in their ser- mons, accused him of persecution, defended Black, and falsely held him up to his people as the enemy of all godliness. In the face of all such slander and defamation, he now declared to his good subjects, that as it was his determination on the one hand to maintain religion and the discipline of the Church as established by law, so, on the other, he was resolved to enforce upon all his people, ministers of the Kirk as well as others, that obedience to the laws and reverence for the throne, without which no Christian kingdom could hold together. For this purpose cer tain bonds were in preparation, which the ministers should be required to subscribe under the penalty of a sequestration of their property.\" 1 Meanwhile, the commissioners having- retired from the city, a short breathing time was allowed ; and Secretary Lindsay, trusting that the ministers of Edinburgh might now be more tractable than their brethren, prevailed on the king to send for them. As a preliminary to all accommodation, they insisted that the commissioners should be recalled ; and the 1 Spottiswood, p. 426."], [341, "1596. JAMES VI. 335 king, relaxing in his rigour, appeared on the point of acceding to their wishes, when some of the \" Cubi culars\" as the lords of the bed-chamber and gentlemen of the household were called, interposed their ill offices to prevent an agreement. These ambitious and intriguing men had long envied and hated the Octavians, and had hoped, under colour of the recent dissensions in the Church, to procure their disgrace and dismissal. Nothing could be more unfavourable to such a plot than peace between the king and the Kirk ; nothing more essential to its success than to fan the flame and stir the elements of discord. This they now set about with diabolical ingenuity. They laboured to make the Octavians odious to the party of the Protestant barons and the ministers. They assured them, that all the hot persecution of Mr. Black arose from this hydra-headed crew, of whom they knew the leaders to be Papists. They insinu ated to the Octavians that the animosity of their enemies in the Kirk was so implacable as to throw their lives into jeopardy ; and they abused the king's ear, to whom their office gave them unlimited access, by tales against the citizens of Edinburgh ; who mounted guard every night, as they affirmed, over the houses of their ministers, lest their lives should fall a sacrifice to the unmitigable rage of their sovereign. By these abominable artifices, the single end of which was to destroy the government of the Octa vians, the hopes of peace were entirely blasted ; and the little lull which had succeeded the retirement of the commissioners was followed by a more terrific tempest than had yet occurred. The king, incensed at the conduct of the citizens and the suspicion which it implied, commanded twenty-four of the most zealous burgesses to leave the capital within six hours; a"], [342, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 336 proceeding which enraged the ministers, whose in dignation blazed to the highest pitch when they received an anonymous letter, assuring them that Huntley had been that night closeted with James. The information was false, and turned out to be an artifice of the \" Cubiculars ;\" but it had the effect in tended, for all was now terror in the Kirk. Balcanquel flew to the pulpit ; and after a general discourse on some text of the Canticles, plunged into the present troubles of the Kirk, arraigned the \" treacherous forms\" of which they had been made the victims; and turning to the noblemen and barons who were his auditors, reminded them, in glowing language, of the deeds of their ancestors in defence of the truth : exhorting them not to disgrace their fathers, but to meet the ministers forthwith in the Little Church. To this quarter so great a crowd now rushed, that the clergy could not make their entrance ; but Mr. Robert Bruce, pressing forward, at last reached the table where the Protestant barons were seated, and warning them of the imminent perils which hung over their heads, the return of the Papist earls, the persecution of Black, the banishment of the commis sioners and the citizens, conjured them to bestir themselves and intercede with the king.1 For this purpose, Lords Lindsay and Forbes, with the Lairds of Barganie and Balquhan, and the two ministers, Bruce and Watson, sought the royal pre sence, then not far off; for the king was at that mo ment sitting in the Upper Tolbooth with some of his privy council, while the judges of the Session were assembled in the Lower House. On being admitted with the rest, Bruce informed the monarch that they 1 Spottiswood, p. 427."], [343, "1596. JAMES VI. 337 were sent by the noblemen and barons then convened, to bemoan and avert the dangers threatened to religion. \"What dangers?\" said James. \"I see none; and who dares convene, contrary to my proclamation ? \" \u2014 \"Dares!\" retorted the fierce Lord Lindsay: \"we dare more than that ; and shall not suffer the truth to be overthrown, and stand tamely by.\" As he said this the clamour increased ; numbers were thronging unmannerly into the presence-chamber, and the king, starting up in alarm, and without giving any answer, retreated down stairs to the Lower House, where the judges were assembled, and commanded the doors to be shut. The Protestant lords and ministers upon this returned to the Little Kirk, where the multitude had been addressed, during their absence, by Mr. Michael Cranston, who had read to them the history of Haman and Mordecai. This story had worked them up to a point that prepared them for any mis chief; and when they heard that the king had turned his back upon their messengers, they became furious with rage and disappointment. Some, dreading the worst, desired to separate ; but Lindsay's lion voice was heard above the clamour, forbidding them to dis perse. Shouts now arose, to force the doors and bring out the wicked Hainan ; others cried out, \"The sword of the Lord and of Gideon ; \" and in the midst of the confusion, an agent of the courtiers, or, as Calderwood terms him, \" a messenger of Satan sent by the Cubi culars,\" vociferated, \" Armour, armour ! save your selves. Fy, fy ! bills and axes ! \" The people now rose in arms ; some rushing one way, some another. Some, thinking the king was laid hands on, ran to the Tolbooth ; some, believing that their ministers were being butchered, flew to the Kirk ; others thundered with their axes and weapons on the Tolbooth doors, VOL. VII. Y"], [344, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 338 calling for President Seton, Mr. Elphinstone, and Mr. Thomas Hamilton, to be given up to them, that they might take order with them as abusers of the king and the Kirk. At this moment, had not a brave deacon of the craftsmen, named Wat, with a small guard, beat them back, the gate would have been forced, and none could have answered for the conse quences. But at last the provost, Sir Alexander Hume, whom the shouts of the uproar had reached as he lay on a sick bed, seizing his sword, rushed in, all haggard and pale, amongst the citizens, and with diffi culty appeased them into a temporary calm. James, who was greatly alarmed, now sent the Earl of Mar to remonstrate with the ministers, whom he found pacing up and down, disconsolately, behind the church, lamenting the tumult, and excusing their own part. On being remonstrated with by Mar, all that they required, they said, was the abolition of the acts done in prejudice of the Kirk during the last four weeks ; that the president, comptroller, and advocate, men suspected in religion, and enemies to the truth, should have no voice in ecclesiastical matters; and that the good citizens who had been banished should be recalled. These demands being reported, the monarch promised to lay them, when put into proper form, before his council ; and seizing the moment of tranquillity, ventured to open the doors of the Lower Tolbooth, and accompanied by the provost, bailies, and Octavians, slipt quietly into the street, and pro ceeded to his palace at Holyrood. Here at last there was safety; and his courage reviving, James expressed himself with the utmost indignation against the ministers and leaders of the late tumult ; vowing that they, the town, the barons, and every living soul connected with the recent dis-"], [345, "1596. JAMES VI. 339 graceful scenes, should bitterly repent them. These sentiments were encouraged by the councillors ; and next morning the king and his whole court, at an early hour, left the city for Linlithgow. Scarcely had they departed when a herald, appearing at the Cross, read a proclamation which struck dismay into the hearts of the people. It described the treasonable uproar of the preceding day, which had been raised by the factious ministers of Edinburgh, who, it stated, after having uttered most seditious speeches in pulpit, had assembled with the noblemen, barons, and others ; had sent an irreverent message to their sovereign, persuaded the citizens to take arms, and put his majesty's life in jeopardy. Such treasonable conduct, it declared, had convinced the king that the capital was no longer a fit place for his own residence, or for the ministration of justice ; he had therefore himself left it with his court, and now commanded the lords of Session, sheriffs, and all other officers of justice, to remove themselves forth of the town of Edinburgh, and be ready to repair to such other place as should be appointed. At the same time he ordered all noblemen and barons to depart instantly to their own houses, and to forbear any further assembly till they had received the royal permission.1 This proclamation had an immediate effect, and caused a great alteration. Men looked sadly and despondingly on each other. The craftsmen and bur gesses foretold the utter decay of their town and trade. All seemed in despair: but nothing could intimidate the Kirkmen ; and Mr. Robert Bruce, one of their principal leaders, ascending the pulpit, up braided them with their pusillanimity. \"A day,\" 1 Spottiswood, pp. 429-430."], [346, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 340 said he, \" a day of trial and terror is at hand. The hypocrisy of many, the flagrant iniquity of others, will clearly appear. The trial shall go through all men : from king and queen to council and nobility, from session to barons, from barons to burgesses, from burgesses to the meanest craftsmen, all will be sifted ; and sorry am I that I should see such weak ness in so many, that ye dare not utter so much as one word for God's glory and the good cause. It is not we that are parties in this cause. No : the quar rel is betwixt a greater Prince and us. We are but silly men and unworthy creatures. But it hath pleased Him who ruleth all things, to set us in this office, and to make us His own mouth, that we should oppose the manifest usurpation intended against His spiritual kingdom ; and sorry am I that our cause should be obscured by this late tumult, and that the enemies should be thereby emboldened to pull the crown off Christ's head.\" x After this stirring address, Lord Hamilton was se cretly invited to place himself at the head of the godly barons and other gentlemen, who had embraced the cause of the Kirk ; and a proposal was made for the excommunication of Seton the president of the Ses sion, and Hamilton the lord advocate ; but in the end it was deemed advisable to defer this awful pro cess to the General Assembly, when these offenders might, with greater solemnity, be delivered over to Satan. Meanwhile a fast was proclaimed ; and Mr. John Welsh, one of the ministers, thundered from one of the city pulpits an extraordinary philippic against the king ; taking for his general subject the epistle sent to the angel of the Church at Ephesus. His 1 Calderwood, p. 366."], [347, "1596. JAMES VI. 341 majesty, he said, had been possessed with a devil ; and one devil having been put out, seven worse spirits were entered in his place. He was, in fact, in a state of frenzy ; and it was lawful for the subjects to rise against him, and take the sword out of his hand ; just as a father of a family, if visited with insanity, might be seized by his children and servants, and tied haud and foot. An execrable doctrine, justly observes Spot tiswood, which was yet received by many of the hearers as a sound application. This insolent attack was scarcely made, when Lord Hamilton, who had at first received the messenger of the Kirk with courtesy, suddenly rode to Linlithgow, and put into the king's hands the letter addressed him by the ministers. It was construed into a direct incitement to rebellion ; and certainly its terms went far that way. Addressing themselves to this noble man, the brethren presumed, they said, that his lord ship was aware of the long conference between his majesty and them ; many concurrings, and as many breaks, in which, at last, the malice of some councillors had come to this, that their stipends were discharged ; the commissioners of the General Assembly banished ; Mr. David Black convicted of treason, and warded ; themselves appointed to suffer the like ; and now, at last, a great number of their flock, who had stood in their defence, expelled from the town. They proceeded to state that the people, in this crisis, animated, no doubt, by the Word of God's Spirit, took arms ; and, unless restrained by their ministers, would, in their fury, have lighted upon many of the councillors, who were threatening destruction, as they believed, to re ligion and government. The letter stated, that the godly barons, with other gentlemen who were in the town, had convened themselves ; they had taken upon"], [348, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596. 342 them the \" Patronicy\" of the Kirk and her cause; but they lacked a head, and specially a nobleman to countenance the matter, and with one consent had made choice of Lord Hamilton. \" And seeing,\" so the ministers concluded their inflammatory epistle, \" God has given your lordship this honour, we could do no less than to follow His calling, and make it known to you, that with all convenient diligence you might come here, utter your affection to the good cause, and receive the honour which is offered you.\" 1 This letter was subscribed by the leading ministers of the Kirk, \u2014 Bruce, Balcanquel, Rollock, Balfour, and Watson ; but the great nobleman to whom it was addressed, resisted the dangerous pre-eminence, and highly offended the Kirk by now placing it in the king's hands, who was not slow to take advantage of the discovery. In truth, the tumult recently com mitted by the citizens, and the part which had been acted in it by the clergy, was a prodigious advantage given to the monarch, who quickly perceived it. He was well aware of the difficulty of dealing with the ministers, as long as they confined themselves to their political attacks in the pulpit, and pleaded an inde pendent jurisdiction ; but the citizens and bailies were unquestionably amenable to the authority of the crown and the laws. They wrere, with scarcely a single ex ception, Protestants ; warmly attached to the Kirk, and a principal element in its power. All this the king knew ; and when he saw that he had them within his grasp, he determined they should feel the full weight of his resentment. It was in vain that the citizens sought to appease the royal wrath, and de spatched the humblest messages to implore its removal, 1 Warrender MSS. vol. B. p. 246."], [349, "1596. JAMES VI. 343 and invite their sovereign back to his capital. The envoys were refused access; the provost was com manded to imprison the ministers, who were accused of having instigated a tumult which had endangered the life of their prince ; the outrage was declared treason by an act of council ; the capital was pro nounced unsafe ; the nobility and gentry interdicted from resorting thither; the inferior judicatories and the supreme court removed ; and the ominous answer returned by the king to the citizens, that he meant ere long to come to Edinburgh in person, and let them know that he was their sovereign. To enforce this, James summoned his Highland nobles with their fierce attendants, and his border barons with their lawless followers. Dark surmises ran through the court, and soon reached the startled ears of the townsmen, that their city was doomed to indiscriminate pillage ; it was to be sacked, perhaps razed, and sown with salt. Will of Kinmont, it was said, was to be let loose upon it ; and his name, al ways formidable, and now more notorious from his recent escape, struck terror into the hearts of the burghers. It was in vain that the ministers attempted to rally the courage of their flocks, spoke of excom municating their enemies in the council, and drew up a bond for the defence of religion. The magistrates refused to subscribe it ; the craftsmen, torn between their love of gain and their devotion to sound doctrine, began to look coldly and doubtfully upon their pastors ; and the four clergymen, who had taken the most active part in the tumult, dreading an arrest, fled by night to Newcastle.1 But these were not the days when the artisans and merchants of a feudal capital were 1 Spottiswood, p. 431."], [350, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596-7. 344 subjects of easy plunder. All had arms, and knew well how to use them ; and the shops, booths, and warehouses, were soon emptied of their goods, which were stowed away in the strongest houses of the town. The sturdy proprietors then took to their weapons, mounted guard over their stores, and determined that neither \" catherans\" nor borderers should spoil them without a bloody struggle.1 On the 1st January, the dreaded entry of the monarch took place. The streets and gates had, early in the morning, been occupied by the various chiefs and clans appointed for the purpose. The provost and magistrates delivered the keys of the city on their knees to the king; professed their deep sorrow for the late tumult, of which, they declared, they were individually guiltless ; and solicited the strictest scrutiny into the whole. As to the inflammatory sermons, and the conduct of their ministers who had been recently outlawed, they should, they said, never be readmitted to their charge without the permission of the king ; and at the next election of the civic authorities, such persons only should be chosen as had previously been approved of by the crown.2 James then proceeded to the High Church, heard a sermon from Mr. David Lindsay, and made an oration to the people, in which he justified himself, cleared his councillors, and deeply blamed the ministers.3 He spoke of his own early education in the reformed religion; his solemn determination to maintain it; to extirpate from his realm all unrepentant idolaters, and to provide for the preaching of God's Word, which had been silent in the capital since the flight of those unworthy pastors who had profaned the 1 Birrel's Diary. > Maitland, vol. ii. p. 1278. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Cecil, 4th January, 1596."], [351, "1596-7. JAMES VI. 345 pulpits by their seditious harangues. Having thus somewhat reassured the trembling citizens, he deemed that he had gone far enough for the present ; and not only declined accepting their offers of submission, but at a succeeding convention of estates, held at Holy rood, anew declared the tumult to be treason, intimated his resolution to prosecute the town criminally, and commanded the provost and bailies to enter their persons in ward, within the town of Perth, before the 1st of February ; to remain there in durance till acquitted, or found guilty of the uproar.1 The sword was thus kept suspended over the heads of the unhappy magistrates and their capital ; and it was quite ap parent that the king, having become convinced of his own strength, was determined to defer the moment of mercy till he had accomplished some great purpose which now filled his mind. This was nothing less than the establishment of Episcopacy. The recent excesses of the more violent ministers had made the deepest impression upon the monarch ; and it was evident to him, that if the prin ciples of independent jurisdiction which they had not hesitated to adopt, were preached and acted upon, there must ensue a perpetual collision between the ecclesiastical and civil authorities. He longed, there fore, to use the words of Spottiswood, to see \" a decent order established in the Kirk, which should be consis tent with the Word of God, the custom of primitive times, and the laws of the realm ; \" and he believed that no fitter moment could occur to carry this great object than the present. His first step was to summon a General Assembly of the church to meet at Perth on the last of February. His next was an act of con- 1 Spottiswood, p. 433."], [352, "u6 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596-7. ciliation. The eight councillors who, under the name of Octavians, had, for the last eighteen months, managed the financial department of the state, and indirectly controlled every part of the government, had been especially obnoxious to the Protestant clergy, and to a section of the courtiers and bedchamber lords. They were hated by the ministers, who suspected them to be mostly concealed Roman Catholics; by the Cubiculars, as the courtiers were called, because they had curtailed their perquisites, and introduced a strict economy ; and the king, by accepting their resignations, believed that he would popularize his intended ecclesiastical innovations.1 These changes he now prefaced by drawing up and circulating amongst the different synods and presbyteries, no less than fifty-five questions, involving the most im portant points in dispute between himself and his clergy ; not, as he solemnly declared, for the purpose of troubling the peace of the Kirk by thorny disputes, but to have its polity cleared, its corruptions eradicated, and a pleasant harmony established between himself and its ministers.2 The spirit and tendency of these questions gave great alarm to the brethren. The king inquired whether matters of external ecclesiastical regimen might not be disputed, salvd fide et re/igione ; whether the prince by himself, or the pastors by them selves, or both conjunctly, should establish the acts concerning the government of the Kirk ; whether the consent of a majority of the flock, and also of the patron, was necessary in the election of pastors ; whether there could be a lawful minister without impositio manuum ; whether pastors should be permit ted to allude by name to councillors and magistrates 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, 18th Jan. 1596-7. 2 Spottiswood, p. 434."], [353, "1596-7. JAMES VI. 347 in the pulpit, or to describe them so minutely as to leave no doubt whom they meant, although the parties so attacked were guiltless of notorious vices, and had not been previously admonished ; whether the pastor should be confined to the doctrine directly flowing from his text, or might preach all things on all texts ; whether the General Assembly of the Kirk might be convoked without consent of the prince, he being plus et Christianus Magistratus ; whether it were lawful to excommunicate such Papists as had never professed the reformed faith ; whether a Christian prince had power to annul a notoriously unjust sentence of ex communication, and to amend such disorders as might occur either by pastors failing in their duties, or by one jurisdiction usurping the province of another ; whether Fasts for general causes might be proclaimed without the command of the prince ; whether any causes infringing upon the civil jurisdiction, or inter fering with vested private rights, might be disputed and ruled in the ecclesiastical courts ; and whether the civil magistrate had not a full right to stay all such proceedings ? 1 These searching interrogatories were received with no inconsiderable dismay by the clergy. They took great offence that their forms of ecclesiastical polity, which they considered irreversibly fixed by act of parliament, and founded, as they contended, on the Word of God, which had been so highly eulogized also by the king in 1592, should be called in question. They saw how acutely the questions had been drawn up ; how deeply they touched the independence of the Kirk ; what a total revolution and alienation the late excesses of the ministers had occasioned in the mind Spottiswood, pp. 435, 436."], [354, "1596-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 348 of the sovereign, and how earnest and determined he seemed in the whole matter. All this demanded instant vigilance and resistance. Many private conferences were held ; and in the end of February the brethren of the synod of Fife con vened at St. Andrews ; where, after \" tossing of the king's questions for sundry days,\" they drew up their replies, which, as was to be expected, ruled every thing in favour of the Kirk, and resisted every claim on the part of the king. Some of these answers are remark able, and seem to show that the principles then laid down were incompatible with the existence of civil government. Thus, the first question, Whether mat ters concerning the external government of the Kirk might not be debated salvci fide et religione ? was met by a peremptory negative ; on the second, they were equally positive that the king had no voice in the discussion or establishment of any acts relating to church government. All the acts of the Kirk (so was their response worded) ought to be established by the Word of God. Of this Word the ordinary inter preters were the pastors and doctors of the Kirk ; the extraordinary expounders, such as were called for in times of corruption, were the prophets, or such men as were endowed by God with extraordinary gifts ; and kings and princes had nothing to do but to ratify and vindicate, by their civil sanctions, that which these pastors and prophets had authoritatively de clared.1 As to the indecent and scurrilous practice of inveighing against particular men and councillors by name in the pulpit, they defended its adoption by what they termed apostolic authority. \" The cauon,\" said they, \" of the Apostle is clear : ' They that sin 1 Calderwood, pp. 382, 383."], [355, "1596-7. JAMES VI. 349 publicly, rebuke publicly, that the rest may fear;' and so much the more if the public sin be in a public person.\" On other points they were equally clear and decided in favour of their own practices and preten sions. All things, they contended, might be spoken on all texts ; and if the minister travelled from his subject, he was only following the express directions of Paul to Timothy. The General Assembly might be convened without the authority of the king, because the officers of the Kirk received their place and war rant directly from Christ, and not from any temporal prince ; and the acts passed in that Assembly were undoubtedly valid, although carried against the royal will. On this question their reasoning was extraor dinary : \" The king,\" they contended, \" should consent to, and give a legal sanction to all acts passed in the Assembly ; and why ? Because the acts of the Assem bly have sufficient authority from Christ, who has promised, that whatever shall be agreed upon on earth by two or three convened in his name, shall be ratified in heaven ; a warrant to which no temporal king or prince can lay claim : and so,\" it continues, \"the acts and constitutions of the Kirk are of higher authority than those of any earthly king; yea, they should command and overrule kings, whose greatest honour should be to be members, nursing fathers and servants to this king Christ Jesus, and his house and queen the Kirk.\"1 To pursue the answers is unneces sary, enough having been given to show their general tendency. But the courage of the synod of Fife, by whom these stout replies were drawn up, did not pervade the whole body of the Kirk ; and the king, who managed the affair with his usual acuteness and 1 Calderwood, p. 386."], [356, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1596-7. 350 dexterity, succeeded in procuring a majority in the General Assembly, and ultimately carrying his own views. This James appears to have effected by holding out hopes of preferment to those who were wavering, and packing the General Assembly with a large majority of north-country ministers, who were generally esteem ed more lukewarm Presbyterians and more devoted courtiers than their lowland brethren. Sir Patrick Murray, a gentleman of the bed-chamber, had been sent for this purpose into the north ; and was so suc cessful in his mission, that when the Assembly met at Perth, the king found them in a more placable and conciliatory mood than could have been anticipated. It was declared, after some sharp discussion, a lawful Assembly ; having power not only to debate, but to conclude such questions as should be brought before them. The royal commissioners, Sir John Cockburn, Sir John Preston, and Mr. Edward Bruce, then pre sented thirteen articles, which embraced the principal points of dispute already included by the king in his original queries ; and a committee of the Assembly having been chosen to consider them, they gave in, next morning, a series of answers, which James pro nounced unsatisfactory, and requested the members of Assembly to meet the estates for the purpose of a more full discussion. When they appeared, he observed that they must be well aware of the object for which he had desired their attendance. \" My purpose,\" said he, \" in calling you together is to amend such things as are amiss, and to take away the ques tions that may move trouble afterwards. If you, for your parts, be willing to have matters righted, things may yet go well. I claim nothing but what is due to every Christian king ; that is, to be Custos et Vindc\u00e6"], [357, "1596-7. JAMES VI. 351 Disciplin\u00e6. Corruptions are crept in, and more are daily growing, by this liberty that preachers take in the application of their doctrine, and censuring every thing that is not to their mind. This I must have amended ; for such discourses serve only to move sedition, and raise tumults. Let the Truth of God be taught in the Chair of Truth, and wickedness be reprobated ; but in such sort as the offender may be bettered, and vice made more odious. To rail against men in pulpit, and express their names, as we know was done of late, there being no just cause, and to make the Word of God, which is ordained to guide men in the way of salvation, an instrument of sedi tion, is a sin, I am sure, beyond all other that can be committed on earth. Hold you within your limits, and I will never blame you, nor suffer others to work you any vexation. The civil government is commit ted to me. It is not your subject ; nor are ye to meddle with it.\" 1 This peremptory mode of address overawed the Assembly ; and after protesting that they had con vened in that place only to evince their obedience to the sovereign, and in no wise consenting to submit matters ecclesiastical to a civil judicatory, they with drew to their ordinary place of meeting, and prepared their amended answers ; with which the king declared himself satisfied for the present. And he had good reason to be so ; for he had already gained some prin cipal points. It was agreed that the monarch, either by himself or his commissioners, might propose to the General Assembly any reformation or amendment in ecclesiastical matters connected with the external government of the Kirk; that no unusual conven- 1 Spottiswood, p. 440."], [358, "1597. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 352 tions should be held amongst pastors without the royal consent ; that the acts of the privy council, or the laws passed by the three estates, should not be at tacked or discussed in the pulpit, without remedy having been first sought from the king ; that in the principal towns of the realm no minister should be chosen without consent of the king, and of the flock ; and that no man should be by name rebuked in the pulpit, unless he had fled from justice, or were under sentence of excommunication.1 James's next step was to reconcile the Catholic lords to the Kirk ; and he was here equally successful. He had already written a peremptory letter to Huntley, informing him that the time was come when he must either embrace the Protestant faith, remain in Scotland, and be restored to his honours and his estates ; or leave his country for ever, if, as the king expressed it in his letter, his conscience were so \"kittle\"3 as to refuse these conditions; in which case, James added, \" Look never to be a Scots man again!\" The letter concluded with these solemn words: \u2014 \" Deceive not yourself, to think that by lingering of time, your wife and your allies shall ever get you better conditions. I must love myself and my own estate better than all the world ; and think not that I will suffer any professing a contrary religion to dwell in this land.\" 3 The conditions presented to Huntley, Angus, and Errol, were, that after conference with the Presbyte rian ministers, who should be careful to instruct them in the truth, they should acknowledge the Kirk of 1 Spottiswood, p. 441. 2 j. e.

On the meeting of the General Assembly at Dundee, (10th May, 1597,) the brethren who had been ap- pointed for this purpose, reported that the earls had recanted their errors, subscribed the Confession of Faith, and so completely fulfilled all the conditions required of them, that nothing more remained, than the pleasing duty of receiving them once more into communion with the Kirk. But, at the very moment of reconciliation, it was found that Mr. James Gordon, a Jesuit, had glided in disguise into the country of Huntley, and was busy in shaking his resolution ; whilst a daring Catholic baron, named Barclay of Ladyland, seized and fortified Ailsa, a small island in the shape of a huge, rugged rock, off the coast of Ayr, with the design of delivering it to the Spaniards, who had promised to make a descent in that quarter. This desperate enterprise was defeated by Mr. Andrew Knox, minister of Paisley, whose prowess had been shown some five years before this, in seizing George Kerr with the Spanish Blanks.1 With like success, this devoted member of the Kirk, having discovered Barclay's plot, girded on his sword ; and taking boat, with a few daring assistants, attacked the traitor on his rock, and reduced him to such extremity, that rather than be taken alive he rushed into the sea, and in one moment choked both himself and his treason.2 This reverse confirmed the Catholic lords in their convictions ; and the ceremony of their reconciliation 1 Supra, p. 187. 2 Spottiswood, p. 445.

As it was an event particularly acceptable to the king, and considered a great triumph by the Kirk, the proceedings were conducted with much solemnity. After a strict fast, held on Saturday the 25th of June, on which day the three earls, Huntley, Angus, and Errol, made up all deadly quarrels, and shook hands with their enemies, mutually imploring and receiving forgiveness ; the congregation assembled on Sunday the 26th in the Old Kirk at Aberdeen, which was crowded with the noblemen, barons, and common people. In the main aisle was a table for the sacra- ment of the Lord's Supper ; and immediately before the sermon, the three earls rose from their places, and subscribed the Confession of Faith. The sermon followed, preached by Mr. John Gledstanes; after which the earls rose, and with a loud voice made open confession of their late defection and apostacy, professing their present conviction of the truth of the Presbyterian faith, and their resolution to remain steadfast in the same. Huntley then declared before God, his majesty, and the Kirk, his deep peniteuce for the murder of the Earl of Moray ; after which the three noble delinquents were absolved from the sentence of excommunication, and received by the ministers, the royal commissioner, and the provost and magistrates, into the bosom of the Kirk. A person in the dress of a penitent now threw himself on his knees before the pulpit : it was the Laird of \"Gicht, who implored pardon for his supporting Both- well, and entreated to be released from his sentence of excommunication. All this was granted. The repentant earls then received the sacrament after the Presbyterian form ; solemnly swore to keep good"], [361, "1597. JAMES VI. 355 order in their wide and wild territories, executing justice, destroying \" bangsters,\" and showing them selves, in all respects, \"good justiciars;\" and, on the succeeding day, Marchmont Herald proclaimed their reconciliation by sound of trumpet at the Cross, which was hung with tapestry, and surrounded by multi tudes, who shouted their joy, drank their healths, and tossed their glasses in the air.1 This success gave strength to the king's govern ment, and encouraged James to go forward with his great ecclesiastical project ; but he proceeded with caution, and took care not to alarm the Kirk by pre maturely disclosing the full extent of his reforms. He had now secured in his interest a large party of the ministers ; but the elements of democracy, and the hatred of any thing approaching to a hierarchy, were still deeply rooted in the General Assembly, and in the hearts of the people. Mr. Andrew Melvil, principal of the college of St. Andrews, a man singu larly learned, ready in debate, sarcastic, audacious, and overbearing, led the popular party, with his nephew, James Melvil, who was warmly attached to the same principles, but of a gentler spirit. Many others assisted them; and the king, anxious to get rid of their opposition, proposed that, instead of the whole Assembly continuing its proceedings, a general commission should be granted to some of the wisest amongst the brethren, who might consult and co operate with the monarch upon various matters of weight which concerned \" not only particular flocks, but the whole estate and body of the Kirk.\" 2 This was agreed to. Fourteen ministers were chosen, 1 Thomas Mollison to Mr. Robert Paip, Aberdeen, 28th June, 1597.

This was followed by a strict and searching visitation of the university of St. Andrews, the stronghold of its rector, Mr. Andrew Melvil; who in his office of principal had, as the king conceived, been too busy in disseminating amongst the students his favourite principles of ministerial parity and popular power. A new rector was elected ; a certain mode of teaching prescribed to the several professors ; and a more strict economy introduced into the dis posal of the rents of the university, by the appoint ment of a financial council. During the summer and autumn, James was busily occupied with the trial of witches, and an expedition to the borders ; in which last he acted with great energy. Fourteen of the most notorious offenders were taken and hanged ; thirty-six of the principal barons, who had encouraged their outrages, seized and brought prisoners to the capital ; and Lord Ochiltree left as lieutenant and warden over the disturbed dis tricts. Parliament now assembled, and opened with some proceedings on the part of the king, which showed an alienation from England. In an oration to his nobility, he dwelt on the wrongs he had received in the execution of his mother ; the interruption in the payment of his gratuity ; the scornful answers"], [363, "1597. JAMES VI. 357 returned to his temperate remonstrance ; the unjust imputations of Elizabeth, who accused him of excit ing Poland and Denmark against her, and fostering rebellion in Ireland. But what had most deeply offended him, was the attempt made recently in the English parliament to defeat his title to the throne of that kingdom ; a subject upon which, owing to the daily reports of the shattered health of the queen, he had become more keenly sensitive than ever.1 Against all this it was evident he now resolved to be timely on his guard ; but in the meantime his mind was full of that great plan which had so long occupied it \u2014 the establishment of the order of bishops. For this all was now ripe ; and when the commissioners of the Kirk laid their petition before parliament, one of its requisitions was found to be as follows : \u2014 \" That the ministers, as representing the church and third estate of the kingdom, might be admitted to have a voice in parliament.\" It was at once seen that under this application, which had been so artfully managed to come not from the king but the Kirk, the first step was made for restoring the order of bishops. The monarch, indeed, did not now deny it : he knew that he had a majority in the Assembly, and looked for an easy victory ; but something of the ancient courage and fervour of Presbyterianism remained. Ferguson, now venerable from his age and experience, lifted up his testimony against the project for bringing his brethren into parliament. It was, he affirmed, a court strata gem ; and if they suffered it to succeed, would be as fatal, from what it carried within its bowels, as the horse to the unhappy Trojans. \" Let the words,\" said 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, George Nicolson to Sir R. Cecil, 15th December, 1597."], [364, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1597-8. 358 he, \" of the Dardan prophetess ring in your ears, ' Equo ne credite Teucri ! ' \" Andrew Melvil, whom the court party had in vain attempted to exclude, argued against the petition in his wonted rapid and powerful style ; and John Davison, tearing away from the king's speech, and the arguments of his adherents, the thin veil with which their ultimate design was covered, pointed, in a strain of witty and biting irony, to the future bench of bishops, and their primate at their head. \" Busk him, busk him,\" said he, \" as bonnilie as ye can, and fetch him in as fairly as ye will \u2014 we ken him weel eneuch ; we see the horns of his mitre.\"1 But these were insulated efforts, and had so little effect, that the king, without difficulty, procured an act to be passed, which declared, \" That such pastors and ministers as the crown provided to the place and dignity of a bishop, abbot, or other prelate, should have voice in parliament as freely as any other ecclesiastical prelate had in any former age.\" 2 A General Assembly was soon after convened, in which the subject was solemnly argued in the king's presence, first by a committee of brethren, and after wards by the whole church.3 As a preparation for this, James had tried every method of conciliation. He had extended his forgiveness to the ministers of Edinburgh for their part in the late tumult : he had restored their privileges, and the comfort of his royal presence and pardon, to the magistrates and the citizens of the capital ; not, however, without having first imposed on them a heavy fine. To those stern and courageous supporters of the Presbyterian estab- 1 Calderwood, p. 415.

Mr. Andrew Melvil, who pleaded a right to be present in the Assembly, as he had a \" doctoral charge in the Kirk,\" was commanded, under pain of treason, to leave the city ; others, whose subserviency was doubtful, were wearied out and induced to retire by lengthened preliminary discussions ; and at last the king opened his great project in a studied harangue. He dwelt on his constant care to adorn and favour the Kirk, to remove controversies, restore discipline, and increase its patrimony. All, he said, was in a fair road to success ; but in order to ensure it and perfect the reform, it was absolutely requisite that ministers should have a vote in parliament, without which the Kirk could not be saved from falling into poverty and contempt. \" I mean not,\" said he, emphatically, \" to bring in Papistical or Anglican bishops, but only that the best and wisest of the ministry should be selected by your Assembly to have a place in council and par liament, to sit upon their own affairs, and not to stand always at the door like poor supplicants, utterly de spised and disregarded.\"1 A keen argument followed. Mr. James Melvil, Davison, Bruce, Carmichael, and Aird, all devoted and talented ministers, spoke against the project, and denounced it in the strongest lan guage. On the other side, the brunt of the battle, in its defence, fell on Gledstanes, and the king himself, no mean adept in ecclesiastical polemics ; but, if we may believe Calderwood, the main element of success was the presence of the northern brethren ; whom this historian describes as a sad, subservient rabble, led by Mr. Gilbert Bodie, \" a drunken Orkney ass,\" whose name described their character : all being for the body, 1 Calderwood, p. 418."], [366, "1597-8. 360 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with small regard to the spirit.1 In the end the ques tion was carried by a majority of ten : the Assembly finding that it was expedient for the good of the Kirk that the ministers, as the third estate of the realm, should have a vote in parliament ; that the same number, being fifty-one or thereby, should be chosen, as were wont of old, in time of the Papistical Kirk, to be bishops, abbots, and priors; and that their election should belong partly to the king and partly to the Kirk.2 This resolution was adopted in March 1597-8 ; but the final establishment of Episcopacy did not take place till more than a twelvemonth after this, in a General Assembly convoked at Montrose on the 28th March, 1600. On that occasion, it was decided that the king should choose each bishop, for every place that was to be filled, out of a \"leet\" or body of six, selected by the Kirk. Various caveats, or conditions, were added, to secure the Kirk against any abuse of their powers by these new dignitaries. They were to propound nothing in parliament, in name of the Kirk, without its special warrant and direction. They were, at every General Assembly, to give an account of the manner in which they had executed their commission ; they were to be contented with such part of their benefices as the king had assigned for their living; to eschew dilapidation; to attend faithfully on their individual flocks ; to claim no higher power than the rest of their brethren in matters of discipline, visitation, and other points of ecclesiastical government ; and, lastly, to be as obedient to authority, and amenable to censure in all presbyteries and provincial or General Assemblies, 1 Calderwood, p. 419. 2 Ibid. pp. 420, 421."], [367, "1597-8.

James was too well satisfied with the reality of his success in carrying his great scheme to so prosperous an issue, to cavil at this shadow of opposition ; and the subject was handed over to the next General Assembly. The feelings with which this triumph of prelatical principles was regarded by the sincere and stern adherents of Puritanism and parity, will be best understood by this brief extract from the work of one of its ablest advocates, the historian Calderwood : \" Thus,\" says he, \" the Trojan horse, the Episcopacy, was brought in, covered with caveats, that the danger might not be seen ; which, notwithstanding, was seen of many, and opponed unto ; considering it to be better to hold thieves at the door, than to have an eye unto them in the house, that they steal not : and, indeed, the event declared that their fear was not without just cause; for those commissioners voters in parliament, afterwards bishops, did violate their caveats as easily as Sampson did the cords wherewith he was bound.\"2 2 Ibid. 1 Calderwood, p. 441."], [368, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1597-8. 362 CHAP.

Having thus continuously traced the establishment in Scotland of this limited Episcopacy, we must look back for a moment on the civil history of the country. This was not marked by any great or striking events. There was no external war, and no internal rebellion or commotion ; and the success which had attended all the late measures of the king produced a tranquil lity in the country, which had the best effects on its general prosperity. James had triumphed over the extreme license and democratic movements of the Kirk ; had restrained the personal attacks of its pul pit ; defined, with something of precision, the limits between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions ; evinced an anxiety to raise the character and useful ness of the clergy, by granting them a fixed provision ; and added consideration and dignity to the Presbyte rian polity, by giving it a representation in the great council of the country. He had, on the other hand, shown equal wisdom and determination in his conduct to the Roman Catholic earls. None could say that"], [369, "1597-8. JAMES VI. 363 he had acted a lukewarm part to religion. These nobles remained in the country, and had been restored to their estates and honours solely because they wTere reconciled to the church. According to the better principles of our own times, he had acted with extra ordinary severity and intolerance ; but even the high est and hottest Puritan of these unhappy days could not justly accuse him of indifference. He had, more over, strengthened his aristocracy by healing its wounds, removing or binding up the feuds which tore it, and restoring to it three of its greatest members, Huntley, Angus, and Errol. He had punished, with exemplary severity, the tumult which had been ex cited in his capital, and read a lesson of obedience to the magistrates and middle orders, which they were not likely to forget. Lastly, he had, in a personal expedition, reduced his borders to tranquillity; and in his intercourse with England, had shown that, whilst he was determined to preserve peace, he was equally resolved to maintain his independence, and to check that spirit of restless intrigue and interference in which the English ambassadors at the Scottish court had, for so many years, indulged with blameable impunity. Sir Robert Bowes, who had long filled that difficult and dangerous office, had recently died at Berwick, a victim apparently to its anxieties ; and having undergone, during his devoted services, the same trials of penury and neglect which, with scarcely one exception, seem to have been the por tion of his royal mistress's ambassadors and diploma tic agents.1 On the 11th of May he had written to 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir Robert Bowes to Sir R. Cecil, 11th May, 1597. In the last letter but one which Sir Robert Bowes addressed to Cecil from Edinburgh, there is this pathetic passage : \u2014 \" Her majesty's gra cious compassion taken of me, and of my weakness, is great comfort"], [370, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1597-8. 364 his sovereign, imploring his recall, and lamenting that his decay in health, and weakness in body and estate, unfitted him for farther labour : but his remonstrance was ineffectual ; and it was not till nearly six months after, that an order arrived, permitting him to retire, and naming Sir William Bowes as his successor. The release, however, came too late. He was then unable to stand from weakness ; and he only reached Ber wick to expire.1 The duties of his office, in the mean time, devolved upon Mr. George Nicolson, his secretary, a man of ability, whose letters contain much that is valuable in the history of the times. On the arrival of Sir William Bowes at the Scot tish court, he found the king's mind entirely occupied by one great subject \u2014 his title to the English throne after the death of the queen. On this point the tran quillity from other cares now gave James full leisure for thought ; and he evinced an extreme sensitiveness in every thing connected with it. Reports of speeches against his right of succession, in the English parlia ment ; books written in favour of the claim of the Infanta ; intrigues of pretenders at home ; the jealousy with which the Catholics regarded his reconciliation with the Kirk ; the suspicion with wrhich the Kirk observed his favour to the Catholics : all these thorny unto me in my present distress, wherein I now lie, at the seat of God's mercy, and at the point of life, death, sickness, or recovery ; in which as I shall fare you shall be shortly advertised.

JAMES VI. 365 matters perpetually haunted and harassed him. From his observations, the ambassador dreaded that the royal mind was beginning to be alienated from Eng land ; and in his first interview James certainly ex pressed himself with some bitterness against Elizabeth. The expostulations addressed to him by his good sister, he said, were unnecessarily sharp. She accused him of diminished friendliness, of foreign predilections, of credulity and forwardness ; but he must retort these epithets, for he had found herself too ready to believe what was untrue, and to condemn him unheard. It was true that, when he saw other competitors for the crown of England endeavouring, in every way, to advance their own titles, and even making personal applications to the queen, he had begun to think it time to look to his just claim, and to interest his friends in his behalf. It was with this view he had required assistance from his people to furnish ambas sadors to various foreign powers. This, surely, he was entitled to do; but any thing which had been reported of him beyond this was false ; and his desire to entertain all kindly offices with his good sister of England continued as strong as it had been during his whole life.1 Elizabeth, however, was not satisfied : she still suspected that the Scottish court was inimical to England ; and these suspicions were increased by the letters of Nicolson her agent. James was said to be much guided by the opinions of Elphinstone, secretary of state, who was little attached to English interests. There was the warmest friendship between the Scottish queen, Anne of Denmark, and the Coun tess of Huntley, a devoted Catholic. They often slept in the same bed ; and this favoured lady, as Nicolson 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir William Bowes to Sir R.

At this moment a strange circumstance occurred, which exasperated the feelings of both monarchs. A miscreant, named Valentine Thomas, accused James of employing him in a plot against the life of Eliza beth ; and it was at first whispered, and afterwards more plainly asserted at the Scottish court, that the queen, though she did not choose to speak openly, believed the accusation. Some dark expressions which she used in a letter to the king seemed to countenance the idea ; and it was certain that she had employed Sir Edward Coke, Sir Francis Bacon, and other judges, in the investigation. James resented this, and insisted on explanations. It was needless in him, he said, to disclaim \" such vile intended murder ;\" but he demanded the fullest investigation, and the severest punishment of the wretch who had so foully slandered him. He would proclaim it as false to all the world by sound of trumpet, by open challenge, in any number; yea, of a king to a king1 When his late ambassador to England attempted to pacify him, he struck him on the breast, and said he was sure there was a chain of Elizabeth's under his doublet. It was in vain that, to appease him, the Queen of England wrote a letter with her own hand, in which she assured him, that she was not \" of so viperous a nature \" as to harbour a thought against him ; and that the deviser of such abominable slander should 1 MS.

The accusation had been public : the depositions of the villain remained uncancelled : who could say what use might not be made of them against his future rights, and to prejudice him in the hearts of the English people ? Here was the sore point ; and James did not cease to remonstrate till he had extorted from the queen a solemn and formal refutation of the whole story. The subject of his title, indeed, had kept the mon arch, for the last three years, in a state of perpetual and irritable activity. He encouraged authors to write upon the question ; and jurisconsults, heralds, and genealogists, made their harvest of his anxiety. Monsieur Jesse, a French literary adventurer, who in 159G visited the Scottish court, was made Historio graphe au Roi d'Escosse, and commanded to \" Maw abroad\" Secretary Elphinstone's discourse on his majesty's title. Walter Quin, an Irish poet and scholar, drew up a work in Latin on the same subject. Monsieur Damon, another Frenchman, corrected it ; and the king sent the manuscript to Waldegrave, his printer, who, in an agony, declared to Nicolson, that he must either print it, and irrecoverably offend his gracious sovereign Queen Elizabeth, or refuse, at the peril of his life. Nor was this all ; James was sud denly seized with the most sensitive feelings on the subject of his royal mother's memory. His claims came through her ; and slander on the Queen of Scots might taint the transmitted title. Spenser, as it was asserted, had glanced at her under the character of Duessa in his Fairy Queen; and the Scottish secre tary of state insisted that Edward Spenser, (the 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 11th May, 1598, Nicolson to Burgh ley. Ibid. Royal Letters, Scotland, Elizabeth to James, July 1, 1598."], [374, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1598. 368 diplomatist did not even know the immortal poet's name,) should be severely punished. Quin, too, came to the rescue, and wrote an answer to Spenser ; whilst \" Dickson,\" an English pedagogue, who taught the Art of Memory, forsook his ferula, and found in Scot land a more profitable employment in answering the famous Treatise of Doleman, or rather Father Persons, from materials furnished by the king himself.1 These constant cares were only interrupted by the alarming increase of witches and sorcerers, wTho were said to be swarming in thousands in the kingdom ; and for a moment all other cares were forgotten in the intensity with which the monarch threw himself once more into his favourite subject. But a shocking dis covery put an end to this dreadful inquisition. An unhappy creature, named Aitken, was seized on sus picion, put to torture, and in her agony confessed herself guilty, named some associates, and offered to purge the country of the whole crew, if she were pro mised her life. It was granted her ; and she declared that she knew witches at once by a secret mark in their eyes, which could not possibly be mistaken. The tale was swallowed. She was carried for months from town to town throughout the country, and in this diabolical circuit accused many innocent women, who, on little more than the evidence of a look, were tried and burnt. At last suspicion was roused. A woman, whom she had convicted of having the devil's eye mark, was disguised, and, after an interval, again brought before her ; she acquitted her. The experi ment was repeated with like success ; and the miser able creature, falling on her knees, confessed that 1 MS. letter, State- paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 25th Feb. 1597-8. MS.

This, as it well might, brought the royal inquisitioijist of sorcery, and his civil and ecclesias tical assistants, to their senses. The Commission of Inquiry was recalled, and all proceedings against the witches discharged, till the parliament should have determined the form and evidence to be adopted in their trial.1 Every thing was now tranquil in the southern part of the kingdom ; and the whole estate, to use Nicol son's expression to Cecil, so \"marvellous quiet,\"2 that the king had leisure to attend to an important and long-neglected subject \u2014 the condition of the Highlands and Isles. It had, for some time, been James's in tention to visit these remote districts in person, and, as usual, to overawe them by the terror of the royal name, backed by an army and a fleet ; but year after year had passed, and nothing was done. His im poverished finances, his quarrel with the Kirk, his entanglements with the Papist earls, his embassies to foreign courts on the subject of his title, \u2014 all these engrossed his attention ; and the fragments of leisure which remained were filled up by the witches, and a visit made to Scotland by the Duke of Holstein, the brother of his queen, which seems to have thrown the court into a perpetual whirl of pageantry, intoxication, and masquerade. The people, according to Nicolson, groaned at the expense ; and his majesty was much distempered both in his privy purse and his digestion.3 But these revels and potations had at last an end : the joyous Dune took leave ; and the royal mind, 1 Spottiswood, p. 448.

This potent Highland chieftaiu had recently made advances to Elizabeth ; and it is not uninteresting to remark the stateliness with which a prince amongst the northern vikingr approached the English Semiramis. He styled himself Lord of the Isles of Scotland, and chief of the clan Donnel Irish men ; and after a proud enumeration of the petty island princes and chiefs who were ready to follow him in all his enterprises, he offered, upon certain \"reasonable motives and considerations,\" to embrace the service of the Queen of England, and persuade the Isles to throw off all allegiance to the Scottish crown. He and his associates were ready, they declared, on a brief warning, to stir up rebellion throughout all the bounds of the mainland, to \"fasche\"1 his majesty, and weary the whole estates ; to create a necessity for new taxation, and thus disgust all classes of his subjects. To induce Elizabeth to embrace these pro posals, Donald informed the queen, that he knew the secret history of the Scottish king's intercourse with her arch-rebel Tyrone, and could lay before her the whole intrigues of the Catholic earls lately reconciled to the Kirk, but \" meaning nothing less in their hearts than that which they showed outwardly to the world.\" He would disclose, also, he said, the secret history of the Spanish practices in Scotland ; and prove with what activity the northern Jesuits and seminary priests had been weaving their meshes, and pushing forward \" their diabolical, pestiferous, and antichris tian courses ; \" which he, Donald Gorm Macdonald, protested before God and his angels he detested with his whole soul.

It is probable, that under the term \"honest courtesies,\" more substantial rewards wTere found to be meant than Elizabeth was willing to bestow ; and that the perpetual feuds, massacres, and conspiracies which occurred amongst these Highland chiefs and their followers, disgusted this princess, and shook her con fidence in any treaties or alliances proposed by such savage auxiliaries. It was in one of these barbarous plots that Maclean of Duart, a firm friend of Eliza beth, with whose warlike exploits we are already acquainted, met his death ; 2 being treacherously slain in Isla, by his nephew, Sir James Macdonald, who persuaded him to visit the island ; alleging, as a pre text, his desire to make an amicable settlement of their differences. So little did the brave Lord of Duart suspect any foul play, that he came to the meeting without armour, in a silk dress, and with only a rapier at his side. Along with him were his second son, and the best of his kin, in their holiday garb, and with little other arms than their hunting knives and boar-spears ; but although set upon by an ambush of nearly seven hundred men, they made a desperate defence.

When he saw there was no hope, he com manded his son, who fought beside him, to fly, and live to avenge him -f but the chief himself, and a little knot of his clansmen, stood, shoulder to shoulder, and were not cut down till after fifty of their assailants had fallen. The death of this great chief was little resented by the king, for James had long been jealous of his deal ings with Elizabeth, and his bitter hostility to Hunt ley ; whilst, at this moment, Sir James Macdonald of Dunluce, his murderer, was in high favour at the Scottish court.2 This Macdonald, known in Irish history as James Macsorlie, had been long a thorn in the side of England, stirring up rebellion in Ireland, aud offering his services to James as an active parti san both in Spanish and Scottish affairs. Macsorlie seems to have been a perfect specimen of those Scoto- Hebridean barons who so often concealed the ferocity of the Highland freebooter under the polished exterior which they had acquired by an occasional residence in the low country. It was his pleasure sometimes to join the court at Falkland or Holyrood, mingle in its festivities, give rich presents to the queen and her ladies, outshine the gayest, and fascinate all observers by the splendour of his tastes and the elegance of his manners ; 3 but suddenly would come a message from some Highland ally, and Macsorlie flew back to his native islands, where, the moment his foot touched the heather, the gay courtier became a rampant and blood-bolstered savage. Macsorlie had, for years, 1 The present Earl Compton, eldest son of the Marquis Northamp ton, is descended, through his mother, the late amiable and accom plished Lady Compton, from this second son. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, Aug. 10, 1598. 3 Analecta Scotica, p. 105, Sir John Skene to the Lord Secretary."], [379, "1598.

At one time the king resolved to proceed to the disturbed districts in person, and fix his head-quarters in Ken tire ; at another, a deputy was to be sent, armed with regal powers ; and twice the Duke of Lennox was nominated to this arduous office.2 The old plan, too, might have been repeated, of granting a royal com mission to one or other of the northern Reguli, who were ever prepared, under the plea of loyalty, to strengthen their own hands, and exterminate their brethren ; but this, as had been often felt before, was to abandon the country to utter devastation ; and a more pacific and singular policy was now adopted. An association of Lowland barons, chiefly from Fife, took a lease from the crown of the Isle of Lewis, for which they agreed, after seven years' possession, to give the king an annual-rent of one hundred and forty chalders of victual ; and came under an obligation to conquer their farm at their own charges.

And this kind of feudal joint-stock company actually commenced their operations with a force of six hundred soldiers, and a motley multitude of farmers, ploughmen, artifi cers, and pedlars. But the Celtic population and their haughty chiefs, could not consent to be handed over, in this wholesale fashion, to the tender mercies and agricultural lectures of a set of Saxon adventurers. The Lowland barons arrived, only to be attacked with the utmost fury, and to have the leases of their farms, in the old Douglas phrase, written on their own skins with steel pens and bloody ink. For a time, however, they continued the struggle ; and having entered into alliance with some of the native chiefs, fought the Celts with their own weapons, and more than their own ferocity. Instead of agricultural or pastoral pro duce, importations of wool, or samples of grain, from the infant colony, there was sent to the Scottish court a ghastly cargo of twelve human heads in sacks ; and it was hoped that, after such an example of severity, matters might succeed better. But the settlers were deceived. After a feeble and protracted struggle of a few years, sickness and famine, perils by land and perils by water, incessant war and frequent assassina tions, destroyed the colony; and the three great northern chiefs, Macdonald of Sleat, Macleod of Har ris, and Mackenzie of Kintail, enjoyed the delight of seeing the principal gentlemen adventurers made captive by Tormod Macleod ; who, after extorting from them a renunciation of their titles, and an oath never to return to the Lewis, dismissed them to carry to the Scottish court the melancholy reflection, that a Celtic population, and the islands over which it was scattered, were not yet the materials or the field for"], [381, "JAMES VI. 1598. 375 the operations of the economists of Fife and Mid- Lothian.1 The king's recent triumph over the ministers, the vigour with which he had brought the bishops into parliament, and compelled his nobles to renounce their blood-feuds, seem to have persuaded him that his will and prerogative were to bear down all before him ; but a slight circumstance now occurred which, had he been accustomed to watch such political indica tions, might have been full of warning and instruction. The magistrates of Edinburgh had arrested an offen der : he was rescued by one of the servants of the king. The magistrates prosecuted the rescuer, and compelled him to give assurance that he would deliver the original culprit ; but the courtier failed in his promise, and the civic authorities seized him and sent him to prison. An outcry arose. It was deemed disgraceful that an officer of the royal household, a gentleman responsible solely to the king, should be clapt up in jail by a set of burghers and bailies. James interfered, and commanded his servant to be set free ; but the bailies refused. The monarch sent a more angry message ; it was met by a still firmer reply : the provost and magistrates declared that they were ready to resign their offices into the king's hands; as long, however, as they kept them, they would do their duty. James was much enraged, but cooled, and digested the affront.2 Within a fortnight after, however, arose a more serious dispute between the crown and the Court of Session, the supreme court of judicature, in which its 1 Gregory's History of the Western Highlands and Isles of Scotland, pp. 290-299.

The subject of quarrel was a judgment pronounced by the court in favour of the celebrated minister of the Kirk, Mr. Robert Bruce, who had been deprived of his stipend by the king. Bruce sued the crown before the Session, and obtained a decision in his favour. The monarch appealed, came to the court in person, pleaded his own cause with the utmost violence, and commanded the judges to give their vote against Mr. Robert. The President Seton then rose : \" My liege,\" said he, \" it is my part to speak first in this court, of which your highness has made me head. You are our king; we, your subjects, bound and ready to obey you from the heart, and with all devotion to serve you with our lives and substance ; but this is a matter of law, in which we are sworn to do justice according to our conscience and the statutes of the realm. Your majesty may, indeed, command us to the con trary ; in which case I, and every honest man on this bench, will either vote according to conscience, or resign and not vote at all.\" Another of the judges, Lord Newbattle, then rose, and observed, \" That it had been spoken in the city, to his majesty's great slander, and theirs who were his judges, that they dared not do justice to all classes, but were compelled to vote as the king commanded : a foul imputation, to which the lie that day should be given ; for they would now deliver a unanimous opinion against the crown.\" For this brave and dignified conduct James was unprepared ; and he proceeded to reason long and earnestly with the recusants ; but persua sions, arguments, taunts, and threats, were unavailing. The judges, with only two dissentient votes, pro-"], [383, "1598-9. JAMES VI. 377 nounced their decision in favour of Mr. Robert Bruce ; and the mortified monarch flung out of court, as a letter of the day informs us, muttering revenge, and raging marvellously.1 When the subservient temper of these times is considered, and we remem ber that Seton the president was a Roman Catholic, whilst Bruce, in whose favour he and his brethren decided, was a chief leader of the Presbyterian mini sters, it would be .unjust to withhold our admiration from a judge and a court which had the courage thus fearlessly to assert the supremacy of the law. It was during the course of this year that the Queen of England lost Lord Burghley, who died on the 4th of August, 1598, in his seventy-eighth year; a long tried and affectionate servant to his royal mistress ; but of whom, however high his character as an English statesman, no Scottish historian can speak without censure. He had been, for nearly forty years, the almost exclusive adviser of the Eng lish queen in her Scottish affairs. It was chiefly his advice and exertions that brought the unhappy Mary to the scaffold ; and in his policy towards Scotland, he seems almost invariably to have acted upon the principle, that to foster civil dissension in that king dom, was to give additional strength and security to England. Happily, the time has come when we may pronounce this maxim as unsound as it is dishonest ; but in those days, craft was mistaken for political wisdom : and Sir Robert Cecil, Lord Burghley 's second son, who now succeeded to his father's power, had been educated in the same narrow school. This able man, who filled the office of secretary of state to Elizabeth, had, as we have seen, for some 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 16th March, 1598-9."], [384, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1599. 378 years taken the chief management of Scottish affairs ; and, soon after his father's death, he became deeply alarmed for the orthodoxy of James and his queen ; suspecting them, as appears by a paper in his own hand, of growing every day more devoted in their affection to the pope.1 That these were ideal terrors of the English secretary, the result plainly showed ; but the true key to this apparent papal predilection was James's extreme poverty, the rigid economy of Elizabeth, who refused to supply his wants, and a hope entertained by the Scottish king, that if he ex hibited a disposition to relax in the rigidity of his Protestant principles, and to maintain an amicable intercourse with the Catholics, his exhausted ex chequer might be recruited by a supply of Roman and Spanish gold. But Cecil, although he allowed some weight to this, thought it too slight a cause to account for the strong symptoms of declension from the reformed opinions exhibited both by the king and his councillors, and advised his royal mistress instantly to despatch Sir William Bowes into Scot land, whose veteran experience in Scottish politics might, he hoped, bring about a reaction. Want of money might, as Cecil contended, explain somewhat of James's late coldness ; but there must be deeper agencies and convictions producing the strange ap pearances now exhibited by a country which had, within these few years, stood in the van of Protestant kingdoms ; which had been the stronghold of Presby terian purity. It was noted, too, by Cecil, that Elphinstone, James's principal secretary of state, was a Catholic ; that Seton, the president of the Session, was a Catholic ; that Lord Livingstone, the governor 1 MS.

JAMES VI. 379 of the young princesses, was a Catholic; and that Huntley, who, notwithstanding his recent recantation, was strongly suspected of a secret attachment to his ancient faith, possessed the highest influence over the king.1 Then, James's late embassies to Catholic princes ; the favour shown to Gordon the Jesuit ; his secret encouragement of Tyrone, the great enemy of England ; a late mission of Colonel Semple to Spain ; his animosity to the ministers of the Kirk ; his in troduction of bishops ; his correspondence with the Duchess of Feria, and other Catholics ; and even his speeches in the open convention of his three estates, were all quoted, and not without good reason, as strong proofs of his defection. The necessities to which the king had reduced himself by his too lavish gifts to his favourites, and the thoughtless extravagance of his household, were indeed deplorable, and produced repeated remon strances from his treasurer, comptroller, and other financial officers. Money, they said, in a homely and passionate memorial, was required for the \" entertain ment of the king's bairns, gotten and to be begotten ;\" for the renewing of his majesty's whole moveables and silver work, all worn and consumed; for the repair and fortification of his castles of Edinburgh, Dunbarton, and Blackness ; for the keeping up of his palaces, of which Holyrood and Linlithgow were in shameful decay, and in some parts wholly ruinous. Money was required in all departments of the service of the state, and in all districts, without the kingdom and within it, in the south and in the north. There were no funds to pay the resident in England ; no funds to procure secret intelligence ; none to support 1 MS.

Elizabeth replied by sending him a list of her gratuities, which proved that, from 1592 to 1599, she had given him twenty-six thousand pounds.2 At court, the want of money produced strange scenes; and the high offices of state, instead of being sought after as objects of ambition, were shunned as thank less and ruinous to their possessors. The great office of lord high-treasurer was going a-begging. Blantyre declared he could hold it no longer. Cassillis, a young nobleman who had recently married the rich widow of the Chancellor Maitland, a lady who might have been his mother, was prevailed on to accept it ; and had takeu the oaths, when the gossip of the court brought to his ears an ominous speech of the king, who had been heard to say, that Lady Cassillis's purse should now be opened for her rose nobles. This alarmed the incipient treasurer into a prompt resignation; but James stormed, ordered his arrest, seized his and his wife's houses, and compelled him to purchase his pardon by a heavy fine.3 In the end the dangerous gift was accepted by the Master of Elphinstone, brother of the secretary of state, \" a wise, stout man,\" as Nicolson characterizes him. Yet all his wisdom and firmness were unequal to the task of recruiting the public purse ; and so utterly im poverished did he find it, that the expenses of the 1 MS.

James had been recently employing his leisure hours in writ ing his celebrated Teatise on Government, the Basi licon Doron, which he had addressed to his son the Prince of Wales; and having employed Sir James Sempil, one of his gentlemen, to make a transcript, the work was imprudently shown by him to Andrew Melvil; who took offence at some passages, made copies of them, and laying them, without mentioning any names, before the presbytery of St. Andrews, accused the anonymous author of having bitterly defamed the Kirk. What the exact passages were which Melvil had transcribed does not appear ; but it is certain that the book contained an attack upon the Presbyterian form of church government, and that the prince was instructed to hold none for his friends but such as had been faithful to the late Queen of Scots. It was very clear, (so the ministers argued,) that no person entertaining such sentiments as were openly expressed in this work, could endure for any long time the wholesome discipline of the Kirk ; and that the severe and sweeping censure pronounced upon the Scottish Reformation, as the offspring of popular tumult and rebellion, very plainly indicated the author's leaning to Prelacy and Popery. What was to be expected, said they, from a writer who described the leaders of that glorious work as \" fiery 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 20th April. 1599.

What was to be hoped for if those men, who had been ever the cham pions of the truth, were to be held up to scorn and avoidance in terms like the following : \" Take heed, therefore, my son, to such Puritans, very pests in the church and commonweal, whom no deserts can oblige, neither oaths nor promises bind ; breathing nothing but sedition and calumnies, aspiring without measure, railing without reason ; and making their own ima ginations (without any warrant of the Word) the square of their conscience.

The rumour had now flown through the country that James was the author of the passages, and had given instructions to the prince, which showed an inveterate enmity to the Kirk ; and it was thought that the publication of the whole work would be the likeliest means to silence the clamour. The book accordingly made its appearance ; and in Archbishop Spottiswood's"], [389, "1599. JAMES VI. 383 opinion,1 did more for James's title, by the admira tion it raised in England for the piety and wisdom of the royal author, than all the Discourses on the Succession which were published at this time. In Scotland the effect, if we believe Sir William Bowes, was the very opposite. It was received by the mini sters with a paroxysm of indignation ; and soon after the arrival of the English ambassador, the whole Kirk agreed to proclaim a general Fast, to avert, by prayer and humiliation, the judgments so likely to fall on an apostate king and a miserable country. For two entire days the Fast was rigidly observed ; and Bowes declared, in his letter to Cecil, that in all his life he had never been witness to a more holy or powerful practice of religion.2 From the pulpit the ministers proclaimed to the people the chief causes for their call to mourning. A general coldness in God's ser vice had seized, they said, on all ranks. The enemies of the Gospel, who in purer days had been driven into banishment, were now every where returning; and almost a third of the realm was deprived of every means for the teaching of the people. The king him self had become the defamer of the Kirk ; his children were brought up by an excommunicated Papist ; and the -young nobility, the hopes of the country, Avent abroad meanly instructed, and returned either Atheists or Catholics.3 A singular event occurred at this time, which led to the recall of Bowes the English ambassador, and gave high umbrage to the Scottish king. An English gentleman, named Ashfield,4 had lately come from Berwick on a visit to the Scottish court, who, as 1 Spottiswood, p. 456. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Cecil, 25th June, 1599. 3 Ibid. * Afterwards Sir Edmund Ashfield."], [390, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1599. 384 there is strong reason to believe, was one of those confidential agents whom James had employed in England to give him secret advice and information on the subject of his succession to the English throne, after the death of the queen. Lord Wylloughby, the governor of Berwick, had himself recommended Ash field to James's notice ; but he had scarcely taken his leave, when Wylloughby discovered that he was a sus picious character, and might do much mischief in Scotland. His alarm became still greater, when he found the attention shown to Ashfield by James ; his intimacy with the Catholic party at court, then in great favour with the king ; and the strong suspicion of Bowes the ambassador, that some treachery against England was contemplated. It was determined to destroy it in the bud, by kidnapping the principal party ; and John Guevara, deputy-warden of the east marches, Wylloughby's cousin, undertook the commission. Repairing, with only three assistants, to Edinburgh, it was concerted with Bowes, that the ambassador's coach should be waiting on Leith sands, and that Ashfield, under pretence of taking a pleasure drive, should be inveigled into it, and carried off. All succeeded to a wish. Ashfield, as he took his exer cise on the sands with some gentlemen, amongst whom were young Fernyhirst, Sir Robert Melvil, and Bowes, was met by Guevara and his companions, and easily persuaded, \" under colour of old friendship and good fellowship,\"1 to join in a wine party ; at which, be coming somewhat merry and confused, he readily fell into the trap, entered the coach, and instead of being driven back to Edinburgh, found himself, to his utter confusion, conveyed rapidly to Berwick, and placed 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

Next morning, Wainman, another of the governor's ser vants, arrived with Ashfleld's papers, which he and Bowes had seized, and brought intelligence that the Scottish king was in the greatest rage at the indignity offered him ; and that the people had surrounded Sir William Bowes's lodging, and threatened his life. It had been discovered that the gentlemen who kid napped Ashfield were in Wylloughby's service, that the coach belonged to the English ambassador, and that some intoxicating- potion had been put in his wine. James wrote a severe and dignified remon strance to Wylloughby, in which he demanded to know whether this outrage had been committed under any warrant or order from the English queen;1 assuring him that it was a matter which, without speedy reparation, he would not pass over. To this Wylloughby boldly replied, that what had been done was not in consequence of any warrant from the queen, but in the discharge of his own public duty ;2 whilst Sir William Bowes, who had concerted the whole, when challenged on the subject, made no scruple of asserting, that he had not only no hand in the business, but was utterly ignorant of all about it.3 So true was Sir Henry Wotton's well known 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

James's dissatisfaction, however, was so great, and the coldness and distance with which he treated Bowes made his place so irksome, that Elizabeth soon afterwards recalled him.1 The arrival of a French ambassador at this crisis, increased the dissatisfaction of the English queen and the ministers of the Kirk ; who suspected that his mission, although kept secret, was connected with James's intrigues with the Catholics abroad. He was a gentleman of the house of Bethune, a younger brother of the great Sully, and much caressed at the Scottish court : but what especially alarmed the Kirk, was his having brought a Jesuit along with him, who was frequently closeted with the king ; whilst the openness with which Sully was allowed the exercise of his re ligion, caused the brethren to sigh over the contrast of the present cold and liberal times, with the happy days when it was death to set up the Mass in Scotland. Scarcely had these feelings subsided, and the ministers begun to congratulate themselves on the prospect of the speedy departure of Bethune, when their wrath was rekindled by the arrival of Fletcher and Martin, with their company of comedians ; whom James, who delighted in the theatre, had sent for from England. To the strict notions of these divines, profane plays, and the licentious mummeries of the staoe, were almost as detestable as the Mass itself. The one was idolatry \u2014 the worship of Baal, or the golden calf ; the other was profanity \u2014 the dancing of Herodias' daughter : and as this had led to Herod's rash oath, and the decapitation of the Baptist, so did these English buffoons recall to their mind the miser- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

It was no wonder that, with such feelings, the arrival of this gay troop of players was received with a storm of ecclesiastical wrath, for which the gentlemen of the buskin were little prepared ; and their case appeared desperate, when the magistrates of the capital, acting under the influence of the Kirk, prohibited the inhabitants, by a public act, from haunting the theatre. But James was not so easily defeated. Fletcher had been an old favourite ; nor was this his first visit to Scotland. He had been there before, in 1594 ; and, on his re turn to England, had suffered some persecution from his popularity with James ; who now called the provost and his councillors before him, compelled them to rescind their act, and proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, not only that the comedians should con tinue their entertainments, but insisted that, next Sunday, the ministers should inform their flocks that no restraint or censure should be incurred by any of his good subjects who chose to recreate themselves by \" the said comedies and plays.\" \" Considering,\" so runs the royal act, \" that we are not of purpose, nor intention, to authorize or command any thing quhilk 1 is profane, or may carry any offence.\" : The king's mind had long run intently on the sub ject of the succession ; and he now adopted a measure which, so far as Elizabeth was concerned, was calcu lated rather to injure than advance his title. A general band or contract was drawn up, \" purporting to be made by the good subjects of the king's majesty, for the preservation of his person and the pursuit of 1 Quhilk ; which. \u2022*\" MS. letter, State-paper Office, 12th Nov. 1599, Nicolson to Cecil,"], [394, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1599. 388 his undoubted right to the crown of England and Ireland.\" 1 The whole matter, during its preparation, was kept secret, and James trusted that no whisper would reach the ears of his good sister Elizabeth. But he was disappointed ; for Nicolson, on the 27th November, 1599, thus mentioned it to Cecil. \" I hear, which I beseech your honour to keep close, that there is a general band, subscribed by many, and to be subscribed by all earls, lords, and barons : binding them, by solemn vow and oath, to serve the king with their lives, friends, heritages, goods, and gear ; and to be ready in warlike furniture, for the same on all occasions, but especially for his claim to England.\" 2 The English envoy then mentioned, that on the 10th of the succeeding month of December, there was to be held a full convention of the estates, in which some solid course was to be adopted to supply the king with money, and provide for the arming of his subjects, to be ready when he might need them. But when the estates assembled, the result did not justify expecta tions. The convention, indeed, was fully attended, and sufficiently loyal in its general feeling ; yet when the monarch explained his wants, and sought their advice and assistance, they heard him coldly, and delayed their answTer till the next meeting of the estates. In his harangue, James declared his dislike to any offensive scheme of taxation ; proposing, in its place, that a certain sum should be levied on every head of cattle and sheep throughout the country; but this was utterly refused. He forbore, therefore, to press the point, and contented himself with an appeal to them for that support which all good suh- 1 MS.

He was not certain, he said, how soon he should have occasion to use arms ; but whenever it should be, he knew his right, and would venture crown and all for it. Let them take care, therefore, that the country be furnished with armour according to the acts made two years before.1 This was cheer fully agreed to ; and meanwhile the king, whose financial ingenuity seems to have been whetted by the gloomy prospect of an empty exchequer at the time money was becoming every day more needed, drew up another scheme which was submitted to his estates with as little success as the former. Its object was excellent, being to remove the burden of supplies from the poor commons and labourers of the ground ; for which purpose he proposed, that the whole country should be \" disposed, as it were, into one thousand persons, and each person to pay a parti cular sum;\" which, all being joined, would make up a total equal to his majesty's necessities. Against this plan, which had, at least, the merit of simplicity, a formal protest was presented by the barons and burghs. The Laird of Wemyss in the name of the barons, and John Robertson for the burghs, insisted that they should be especially ex cepted from any commission given to the sheriffs, for the levying such a sum, and should continue to \" stint [tax] themselves in auld manner;\" but as the pro posal was hypothetical, and came before the estates merely as an overture, it was judged enough to meet it by delay ; and so anxious was the king to spare his people, and fall in with the wishes of all, that he not only agreed to except the barons and burghs, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, December 15, 1599, Nicolson to Cecil."], [396, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1599. 390 but to drop the whole scheme if any better should be proposed at the next convention, which was fixed to be held at Edinburgh on the 20th of June.1 It was happy that all ended so amicably ; for at the begin ning of the convention he had exerted himself to carry his purpose by means which were violent and unconstitutional. \" To effect this,\" said Nicolson, in writing to Cecil, \" the king drew in the whole borders, the officers of estate, Sir Robert Kerr, Sir Robert Melvil, and others, contrary to the order there ap pointed, of six only of every estate to have voted for the rest.\" It was during this convention, held at Edinburgh in December, that the king, with advice of his secret council, passed an important act, appointing, in all time coming, the \" first day of the year to begin upon the 1st of January;\" and this statute, it was added, should take effect upon the 1 st day of January next to come, which shall be the 1st day of January 1600.2 Previous to this time the Scottish year had begun on the 25th of March ; and it is worthy of observation, that this still continued the mode of reckoning in England.3 1 MS.

In the course of these labours we are now arrived at an extraordinary plot, of which the history, after all the light shed upon it by recent research, is still, in some points, obscure and contradictory. This is the Gowrie conspiracy. Its author, or, as some have not scrupled to assert, its victim, was the grandson of that Patrick lord Ruthven, who, as we have seen, acted a chief part in the atrocious murder of Riccio, and died in exile soon after that event.1 It was the second son of this nobleman, William, fourth Lord Ruthven, who, after sharing the guilt and banishment of his father for his accession to the same plot, was restored by the Regent Morton, and returned to Scot land to engage in new conspiracies. It was his threats, and the menaces of the fierce Lindsay, that were said to have extorted from the miserable captive of Lochleven the demission of her crown. 11 id ser vices were rewarded by an earldom ; and from the 1 Supra, vol. v. p. 344."], [398, "392 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. fertile brain and unscrupulous principles of the new earl proceeded the plot for the seizure of the king, known by the name of the Raid of Ruthven. He was pardoned ; became again suspected ; threw himself into another enterprise against the government, with Mar and Angus ; was detected, found guilty, and suffered on the scaffold. Of his treason there was no doubt ; but his conviction, as we have seen,1 was procured by a disgraceful expedient, which roused the utmost indignation of his friends. This happened in 1584 ; and, for two years after, the imperious govern ment of Arran directed, or rather compelled, the royal wrath into the severest measures against the house of Ruthven. But the destruction of Arran's power per mitted the king's temper, generally gentle and for giving, to have influence ; and, in 1586, the earldom was* restored to James, the eldest son of the house, who, dying soon after, transmitted it to John, the third earl, the author of the Gowrie conspiracy. Young Gowrie, at the time of his father's execution, could have been scarcely eight years old ; 2 and in the wreck of his house, he, his unhappy mother, and her other children, received an asylum in the north. Here, amidst the savage solitudes of Athole, the country of her son-in-law,3 the widowed countess brought up her children, brooded over her wrongs, and taught her sons the story of their father's murder, as his execu tion was accounted by his party. From such lessons, they seem early to have drunk in that deep passion for revenge, which, in those dark days, was so univer sally felt, that it may be regarded almost as the pulse 1 Supra, vol. vi. pp. 080-383. 2 MS.

JAMES VI. 393 of feudal life ; a passion which, sometimes at a quicker, sometimes at a slower pace, but yet with strong and abiding force, carried on its victims to the consumma tion of their purpose. Meanwhile the royal pity had awoke : the family was restored to its honours ; and the young earl, having been committed to the care of Rollock, the learned principal of the university of Edinburgh, received an excellent education. But the return for all this, on the part both of his mother and himself, was ingratitude and new intrigues. When, in 1593, Bothwell at Holyrood audaciously broke in upon his sovereign, and for a short season obtained possession of his person, it was the Countesses of Gowrie and Athole, the mother and sister of Gowrie, who were his most active assistants ; and in 1594, when the same desperate baron, in conjunction with Athole, Ochiltree, and the Kirk, organized a second plot, the name of the young Earl of Gowrie appeared in the \"band\" which united the conspirators.1 He was thus early bred up in intrigue ; but the king either did not, or would not, discover his guilt : and Gowrie, having received the royal licence to complete his education abroad,2 passed through England into Italy, studied for five years at the university of Padua, and there is said to have so highly distin guished himself, that he became rector of that fatuous seminary.3 The young earl was now only one-and twenty; 4 of an athletic person and noble presence ; excellent in all his exercises ; an accomplished swords- 1 Supra, p. 209, and MS.

Amongst his studies, necromancy, or natural magic, was a favourite pursuit; and his tutor, Rhynd, detected him, when at Padua, wearing cabalistic characters concealed upon his person, which were then sometimes used as spells against diabolic, or recipients of angelic influence.1 He was an enthusiastic chemist ; and, in common with many eminent men of that age, a dabbler in judicial astrology, aud a believer in the great arcanum. It is curious that this propensity to magic and visionary pursuits was hereditary in the Ruthven family. His grandfather, the murderer of Riccio, had given Queen Mary a magic ring, as a preservative against poison. His father, the leader in the Raid of Ruthven, when in Italy, had his fortunes foretold by a wizard ; and the son, when some of his friends had killed an adder in the braes of Strathbran, lamented their haste, and told them he would have diverted them by making it dance to the tune of some cabalistic words which he had learnt in Italy from a great necromancer and divine. During his residence at Padua, Gowrie addressed to the king a letter full of gratitude and affection.2 He kept up, also, a correspondence with his old tutor Rollock ; and, in 1595, sent a long epistle to Malcolm, the minister of the kirk at Perth, expressing the most devoted attachment to Presbyterian prin ciples, and written in that strange, pedantic, puritanic style which then characterized the correspondence of the most zealous of that party.3 The young earl 1 Rhynd's Declaration in Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. pp. 219, 220. 3 Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. p. 330. 3 It has been printed by Mr. Pitcairn, in the second volume of his valuable work, the Criminal Trials, pp. 330, 331."], [401, "1600. JAMES VI. 395 described in this letter, with high exultation and approval, an insane attack made by a fanatical English Protestant upon a Catholic procession, in which he seized the sacred Host, and trampled it under foot ; and concluded by expressions of deep regret that his absence from Scotland did not permit him to set forth God's glory in his native country ; trusting, as he added, to make up for all this on his return. This return took place in 1599, through Switzer land ; and on arriving at Geneva, he became an inmate for three months in the house of the famous reformer Beza, who cherished him as the son of a father whom his party regarded as a martyr to the Protestant faith. From Geneva he travelled to Paris, where he was re ceived with high distinction at the French court, and by Elizabeth's ambassador, Sir Henry Nevil ; who admitted him into his confidence, held private con ferences with him \" on the alterations feared in Scot land,\" to use Nevil's own words, \" found him to be exceedingly well affected to the cause of religion, devoted to Elizabeth's service, and, in short, a noble man of whom, for his good judgment, zeal, and ability, exceeding good use might be made on his return.\"1 Bothwell, his old friend and associate, was also at this time in Paris. On leaving France, Gowrie, carrying warm letters of recommendation from Nevil, pro ceeded to the English court ; where Elizabeth received him with flattering distinction, and kept him for two months; admitting him to her confidence, holding with him great conference 2 on the state of Scotland, which 1 Sir Henry Nevil to Secretary Cecil, 27th Feb. 1599.

It was then no unfrequent occurrence for the incipient intriguer, or conspirator, to be seized or kid napped by the stratagem of his opponents ; and, if true, this circumstance certainly shows how highly the English queen regarded his safety, and what value she set upon his future services. During this stay in England he became familiar with Sir Robert Cecil, at this moment the most confidential minister of Eliza beth ; with the great Lord Wylloughby, one of the honestest and ablest servants of the queen ; 1 and with many others of the leading men about court. At the time of Gowrie's arrival in England, (3d April, 1600,) Elizabeth was deeply incensed with the proceedings of the Scottish king, and his reported in trigues with the Catholics of her owm kingdom, and with the courts of Spain and Rome, on the subject of his title. He had resolved, and made no secret of his resolution, to vindicate his right to the crown of England by arms, if it were necessary ; and he had roused the resentment and alarm of the party of the Kirk to the highest pitch, by the court which he paid to the Catholics, both at home and on the continent. A letter written to Cecil by Colvile, about six months before this, described th^se intrigues and preparations in strong terms. Colvile, it must be remembered, was the confidant of the notorious Bothwell, and an old friend and fellow-conspirator of Gowrie's father. It was cer tain, so said Colvile in this letter, that two envoys had come to the Scottish king from the pope. They had brought high offers : a promise of a hundred 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, James Hudson to Cecil, 3d April, 1600. Also, ibid. B.C. Wylloughby to Cecil, 11th August, 1600."], [403, "1600. JAMES VI. 397 thousand crowns at present, and an engagement to pay down two millions the moment he published liberty of conscience, and declared war with England. Twenty thousand Catholics were said to be ready to join the king the moment he crossed the border. There was not one Catholic prince in Europe who would not support his claim ; and his holiness not only regarded him as the most learned and religious prince of his time, but would willingly follow his advice in restoring to the universal church its purity and discipline.1 In another letter, written some time before this, and dated 17th August, 1599, Coivile speaks to Cecil of the ominous tranquillity of the Scottish court ; which, he says, he had often re marked to be never so quiet as when some \" snake stone was hatching;\" adding, \" Quand le Mediant dort, le Diable le berche.\" He assured Cecil, that the king was highly enraged and excited against the party of the Kirk. The ministers were led by Bruce and Andrew Melvil ; their ranks included Cassillis, Lindsay, Morton, and Blantyre; and he added, with a significancy which this statesman could be at no loss to understand, that if they received any secret encouragement from England, they were devising to send for Gowrie and Argyle, both of whom were then abroad.2 This letter was written towards the end of August, 1599, wdien Gowrie was probably on his route to England ; and in the interval between this and his O 7 arrival at the court of Elizabeth, the estrangement between the Queen of England and the King of Scots had become more embittered. Nicolson, the English 1 MS.

In one of his letters to Cecil, written in the end of April, 1600, when Gowrie was at the English court, and, as we have just seen, admitted to the confidence of this minister and his royal mistress, he described the king as in dulging in expressions of the utmost discontent and anger on the subject of the intended peace between England and Spain. Elizabeth (such were James's words) had long resisted every amicable application made to her on the point of his title ; and now he heard one day she was about to marry the Lady Arabella to the brother of the Emperor Mathias ; the next, that she had sent for young Beauchamp to court ; the next, that in consequence of her peace with Spain, a priest had openly addressed the Infanta, as the destined restorer of the Catholics in England.1 Of all this, James added, the queen refused him any explanation. She treated him with coldness and suspicion ; and it became him to look to his just rights, and provide for the future. Such things were said even openly by the King of Scots ; but in the secrecy of his cabinet, James used far stronger language. He there insisted, that before Elizabeth's death, wdiich, considering her advanced age and broken health, could not be far distant, he must be ready armed, his exchequer well supplied, and the friends on whom he could place reliance assembled on the spot with their full strength. To compass all this, he had spared no exertion. England swarmed with his spies ; and the \" daily creeping in of Englishmen\" to the Scottish court, was a matter which perpetually roused the suspicions of Cecil, and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 24th Dec. 1599."], [405, "1600. JAMES VI. 399 cut his royal mistress to the quick. At this very moment, when Gowrie was in such confidential in tercourse with that princess and her ministers, the Scottish king had received information which made him stand especially on his guard. It was reported that a plot was then being organized by the faction in the interest of England, to compel the king into a more pacific policy, and arrest his warlike prepara tions against that realm -,1 that Colvile, Archibald Douglas, and Douglas the Laird of Spot, all of them old employes of Cecil, were the chief conspirators in England ; and that they were casting about to draw home the Earl of Gowrie, then at the court of Eliza beth, and on whom they reckoned as a great accession to their strength.2 Bothwell, too, the arch-traitor, whom of all men the king hated and dreaded most, had been at Paris at the same time with Gowrie : their former intimacy rendered it almost impossible they should not have met ; and it was now strongly reported, that this desperate man had stolen into Scotland, and had been thrice seen recently in Lid desdale.3 Such was the state of parties ; such the mutual heart-burning, jealousy, intrigues, and preparations between the two sovereigns, when Gowrie, after two months' residence in England, left the court of Eliza beth and returned to his native country. The facts hitherto given are all capable of proof : their effects upon the character of Gowrie, and how far they influ enced or serve to explain his subsequent extraordinary proceedings, can only be conjectural. Yet it appears that they go far to explain something of the mystery 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 20th April, 1600. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. B.C. Guevara to Lord Wylloughby, 23d April, 1600."], [406, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 400 which hitherto has surrounded the origin of this plot ; and that here we have one of those cases where, from the elements on which we form our opinion, conjecture may come indefinitely near to certainty. Gowrie was young : and on youth what must have been worked by the flattery of a queen, and so great a queen as Elizabeth ? He was ambitious and proud ; and when he found that his friends were anxious to place him at the head of the English faction, and in opposition to the hostile projects of the king, was it likely he should decline that pre-eminence ? He was a devoted and enthusiastic Puritan, and hated prelacy. Was such a mind likely to refuse the opportunity that now offered, to re-establish the Presbyterian ascendency, to reinstate his old friends, the ministers, on the ground from which they had been driven ; and to destroy, if possible, that Catholic faith, which, in his judgment, was idolatrous and damnable ? He was animated by a keen desire to revenge his father's death on the monarch wdio had brought him to the scaffold ; and was it probable that when, in the secret conferences which took place with Nevil, Cecil, and Elizabeth, the hostile plans and dangerous intrigues of the King of Scotland were discussed, the Raid of Ruthven should have been forgotten ; or that the nefarious project, so repeatedly hazarded, so often crowned with success, to seize the king's person, and administer the government under his pretended sanc tion, would not present itself? To grasp the supreme power, and have his revenge into the bargain : were such offers unlikely to be held out by so unscru pulous a minister as Cecil ? Was it probable that, if held out, they would be refused by Gowrie? But leaving such speculations, let us proceed. The young earl arrived in Scotland, after his long"], [407, "1600. JAMES VI. 401 absence, about the 20th of May; and some little circumstances accompanied his return, which, after his miserable fate, were remembered and much dwelt on. He entered the capital surrounded by an un usually brilliant cavalcade of noblemen and gentlemen, the friends and dependents of his house, and amid the shouts of immense crowds who welcomed his return. On hearing of it, the king shook his head, and ob served, that as many shouted when his father lost his head at Stirling. Whether this was said in the pre sence of the young earl, is not added by Calderwood, who gives the anecdote ; but it was noticed, and we may be pretty sure would reach his ear. When he kissed hands, and took his place in the court circle, his fine presence, handsome countenance, and graceful manners, struck every one. He soon became a special favourite of the queen and her ladies, one of whom was his sister, Lady Beatrix Ruthven ; and to the king, his learning and scholarship made him equally acceptable. He had lived in the society of the most eminent foreign scholars, philosophers, and divines ; but he was equally accomplished in all knightly sports, and could discuss the merits of a hawk or hound as enthusiastically as any subject in the circle of the sciences. This was much to James's content ; and as the monarch sat at breakfast, he would often keep Gowrie leaning on the back of his chair, and talk to him with that voluble, undignified familiarity which marked the royal convers -tion. He rallied the young nobleman, also, on his long stay at the English court ; and, as Sir John Carey wrote to Cecil, assriled him with many \" fleytes1 and pretty taunts,\" on the high honours paid him by Elizabeth, his frequent great 1 Fleytes ; scolds, i 2 C VOL. VII."], [408, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 402 conferences with the queen, her offer to bribe him with gold, and the sumptuousness of his reception and en tertainment. He marvelled, too, with good-humoured irony, that his old friends, the ministers of the Kirk, had not ridden out to meet him and form part of his triumphant cavalcade;1 and, half between joke and earnest, contrived to show him that he had watched all his movements, and was perfectly aware of his confidential intercourse with Nevil, Cecil, and Eliza beth herself. All this Gowrie took, or seemed to take, in good part.2 He had certainly, he said, been honourably entertained, and very graciously received by the queen of England ; but this, he believed, was for the king his master's sake, and so he had accepted it. As for gold, he had been offered none : nor did he need it ; he had enough of his own.3 It was in one of those familiar conversations on a strange subject, that an allusion escaped the king, which was afterwards remembered. Queen Anne was at this time great with child, and probably did not take sufficient care of herself; but be this as it may, James consulted Gowrie, who had studied at Padua, then the highest medical school in Europe, on the most common causes of miscarriage. He mentioned several, but insisted on fright or sudden terror as the most dangerous; upon which the king, bursting into a fit of loud and scornful laughter, exclaimed, \" Had that been true, my lord, I should never have been sitting here to ask the question. Remember the slaughter of Seignor Davie, wherein thy grandsire was the chief actor :\" 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Sir John Carey to Sir R. Cecil, 29th May, 1600. 2 Ibid.

JAMES VI. 403 a reckless, cruel thrust, which the young nobleman must have felt like an adder's sting : for not only his grandfather but his father were present at that bloody deed.1 On another occasion, soon after his arrival, a ruffle was nearly taking place in the long gallery at Holy rood, between the servants of Colonel William Stewart and some of the gentlemen of Gowrie's suite. It was this Stewart who had seized his father at Dundee, and dragged him to his trial and death ; and all dreaded a bloody encounter. But Gowrie, to their surprise, beat down the weapons of his followers ; and giving place with a contemptuous gesture to Stewart, per mitted him to walk first into the presence-chamber. On being remonstrated with, his brief and proud reply was a Latin proverb, \" Aquila non captat muscas.\" It is the remark of an old chronicler, that he here covertly alluded to his intended revenge against the king.2 It is certain, at least, that it betrayed a de termination on Gowrie's part to fly at the highest quarry. On his first arrival at court, about the middle of May, 1600, he found the king's mind still concen trated upon that one subject which had so long filled his thoughts, and which he had determined to bring shortly before a convention of his nobility, barons, and burghs. This was the necessity of making pre paration for an event now currently talked of \u2014 the death of Elizabeth. To this end James had summoned a convention of the three estates to meet on the 20th of June. He had resolved to levy a tax upon the country, to pay his ambassadors to foreign parts; 1 Calderwood, MS. History, British Museum, Sloan, 4739, sol. 1389. 2 Anonymous MS. History of Scotland, quoted in Pitcairn's Crimi nal Trials, vol. ii. p. 297."], [410, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 404 and to have such a force in readiness as should over awe his enemies, and give confidence to his supporters. On these proposed measures parties were so divided, and such violent storms were apprehended, that the wisest, as Nicolson wrote to Cecil, wished themselves out of the country ; and Gowrie, by the advice of his friends, after a brief stay at court, retired to his own estates, \" to be a beholder of the issue of these many suspicions.\" x Soon after this, a violent interview took place between the king and the English resident, Nicolson, in which James complained that Elizabeth had treated him with the utmost haughtiness and want of confidence on the subject of the Spanish peace. She blamed him, he said, for matters of which he was wholly innocent, and showed more kindness to a foreign duke and the Infanta than to him. It was openly bragged by one of her subjects, that Bothwell was to be let loose, to come in again and brave it. She had seized a parcel of muskets, which he had de clared upon his honour had been purchased for the use of his household, as if she dreaded they should be turned against herself.2 All this, which was daily reported to Elizabeth and Cecil, increased the un friendly feelings between the two courts, and convinced the English minister that something decided must be done, to check that bold, and almost hostile attitude in which James seemed now determined to insist upon his rights to the English throne. At last the important day of the convention of the three estates arrived. The nobility, including Gowrie amongst the rest, assembled ; the barons and burghs attended ; and the king, after having in many private interviews endeavoured to gain over the leading men 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 27th Mav, 1600. 9 Ibid. 29th May, 1600."], [411, "1600. JAMES VI. 405 to his own views, brought his proposals before the public meeting of the three estates, in a studied harangue. To his extreme indignation and astonish ment, he failed to convince them of the necessity of taxing themselves to raise the sum he required. The majority of the nobility and the prelates, who had been privately canvassed by James, and talked over by the Earl of Mar, were compliant enough ; but the barons and the burghs stoutly resisted. The king adjourned the convention from Monday till Tuesday, employing the interval in threats, en treaties, and remonstrances ; but on this day they were as stubborn as before. Another and longer adjournment, and another meeting took place. It not only found them in the same indomitable humour, but some of the higher barons began to waver. The Lord President Seton, in reply to the assertion of the royal claimant, that he must have au army ready on the queen's death, to maintain his title, argued against the utter folly of attempting to seize that ancient crown by conquest. For such a purpose, he ob served, wdio could say what exact sum might be required ? and if the sum were named, who wTas so insane as to expect that Scotland could raise it ? If about to build a palace, they might have a plan and an estimate ; if to raise an army of so many thou sand men, some certainty might be had of the funds required ; but who would venture to fix the sum necessary for the conquest of England ? and if fixed, who could be so mad as to believe that the poor country of Scotland could raise it, when it was notorious that sundry towns in England and the Low Countries could advance more money than all Scotland together?1 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 22d June, 1600. Ibid, same to same, 29th June, 1600."], [412, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 406 Mr. Edward Bruce argued for the king's views ; and insisted that every true Scotsman, if he regarded the honour of his prince and country, ought to contribute to the sum now required. Let them not imagine, said he, that a refusal would be unaccompanied with danger. Whoever usurped England after Eliza beth's death would have an eye to Scotland ; and if they now suffered their king to be defeated of his right, they might chance to find themselves defeated of their country. This argument somewhat softened James, who had started up in a violent passion and accused the Presi dent Seton of perverting his meaning. But nothing could move the barons and burghs. They reiterated their plea of poverty ; declared, that when the time came, they would furnish their monarch as fair an army as ever good subjects levied for their prince ; and in the meanwhile, instead of forty thousand crowns, would give him forty thousand pounds Scots, on the condition that they should never again be taxed in his time ; and that what they did give should go to his own wants, and not to his hungry courtiers. The king spurned at this diminished and conditional offer, and insisted that it should be put to the vote wdiether it had not been agreed in a former convention at St. Johnston, that a hundred thousand crowns should be advanced him by a thousand persons. On this new question the young Earl of Gowrie now spoke for the first time ; and heading the opposi tion of the barons and the burghs, exposed the king to the disgrace of a second defeat.1 He had, he said, been long absent from the country, and had no personal knowledge of what had taken place at MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 29th June, 1600."], [413, "1600. JAMES VI. 407 St. Johnston ; but he contended that the present offer of the burghs and barons, to give forty thousand pounds to the king, and their promise to raise money for an army when it was required, was quite as good, nay, almost a better proposal, than that so strongly in sisted on by James. Why, then, should his majesty take such deep umbrage at it ? Surely, he continued, it must be evident, that this demand of the king will bring dishonour upon all parties : it is dishonour able for a prince to ask more than his subjects have to give, and suffer the ignominy of a refusal ; it is dis honourable for a people that their poverty should be laid bare to the world, and that all men should see and know they could give so little to their prince.1 This speech of Gowrie, and the daring way in which so young a man threw himself into the ranks of the faction opposed to the king, astonished the assembly. \" Alas!\" said Sir David Murray, a cour tier, who stood near, \" yonder is an unhappy man : his enemies are but seeking an occasion for his death ; and now he has given it.\"2 But if others wondered, the king, to use an expression of Nicolsou's to Cecil, absolutely raged, and dismissed the assembly with a tumultuous burst of fierce and undignified invective ; mingling his abuse of the barons and burghs with praises of his nobility, whom he assured of his friend ship and favour in all their affairs. \" As for you, my masters,\" he exclaimed, turning with flashing eyes to the burghers, \" your matters, too, may chance to come in my way ; and, be assured, I shall remember this day, and be even with you.

Our callings may be inferior, but our devotedness is as great ; and so your majesty will find it when the proper time arrives. As for our places in parliament and convention, we have bought our seats, we have paid your majesty for them, and we cannot with justice be deprived of them. But the throne is surrounded by flatterers, who propagate falsehoods against us : let us be con fronted with our accusers, and we engage to prove them liars.\" 1 With this haughty defence on the part of the lesser barons and burghs, and with the deepest feelings of displeasure against them and Gowrie on the part of the king, the convention separated ; and James had to digest, not only the disgrace of a refusal, but the universal satisfaction which, if we may believe Nicol son, it occasioned in the country. He was not diverted from his purpose, however ; for, not ten days after, Sir Robert Cecil, who was familiar with all that had taken place at the convention, was informed by one of his correspondents, that James's prepara tions against England continued, and that he intended not to tarry till Elizabeth's death. This news was 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 29th June, 1 COO."], [415, "1600. JAMES VI. 409 written partly in cipher, on a slip of paper sent to Cecil, endorsed with the caution, \" To read and burn.\" It contained this passage : \u2014 \" Nicolson tells me he understands, by one who never abused him, that the king is, by all means, seeking a party, and hath a party in England ; and by party or faction, if he can have commodity by either, * * intends not to tarry upon her majesty's death, but take time so soon as without peril he can.\" 1 It is probably from this moment that we may date the actual rise of the Gowrie conspiracy. Elizabeth and James were, as we have just seen, on the very worst terms with each other. Gowrie, by every feel ing of ed .cation, interest, and revenge, was attached to England and its queen ; and his conduct in the convention had now thrown him into mortal opposition with the King of Scots. James was intriguing with the queen's subjects in England. It was suspected he had fomented the rebellion in Ireland ; and all this at a moment when the queen was most likely to resent it deeply ; for she had lately been roused and irritated by the insane projects of Essex. Although aged, Elizabeth was still unbroken in health ; yet James must be watching for her death, and openly admo nishing his subjects to make preparations for taking possession of her crown. This Gowrie knew ; and he reckoned on the support of England in any thing he undertook against the king. He could build, too, with certainty on the favourable opinion of the lesser barons, and the influential body of the burghs. They had already made their stand against the king ; in the convention Gowrie had joined them ; and they under stood each other. On the Kirk he could rely with 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 9th July, 1600. Secret informa tion sent in the letter, endorsed, To read and burn."], [416, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 410 still more certainty : he was the darling hope of the Presbyterian party, the son of their martyr : the youthful Daniel, who had kept his first faith entire in the bosom of idolatry, and in the very head-quarters of Antichrist. Could he doubt that, in any attempt to stay the headlong haste with which their unhappy king seemed to be throwing himself into the arms of the Catholic party, he would fail to have the whole force of the Kirk upon his side ? All this was encou- raging : and when, in addition to these inducements, he contemplated the rich reward awaiting his success, if he made himself master of the king's person \u2014 the gratification of his ambition, power, place, fame, above all, revenge \u2014 was it likely that a man of Gowrie's temperament would resist them all ? Besides, he had enemies : his death and ruin, if we may believe one who must have had good cause of knowledge, were already resolved on ; x and if he did not become the assailant, it was a narrow chance but he might prove the victim. If, on the other hand, he could but strike the blow, his popularity and high connexions promised him many friends, on whose concurrence he could safely reckon. But how was the blow to be struck ? Here was the whole difficulty and danger ; and here, young as he was, Gowrie appears to have devised a plot unlike any hitherto known in his country's history, although fertile in conspiracies: more Italian than Scottish; crafty, rather than openly courageous ; and, from its very originality, not, perhaps, unlikely to have suc ceeded, had the parts assigned to the conspirators been differently cast. His design appears to have been to decoy the king, by some plausible tale, into 1 Supra, p. 407."], [417, "1600. JAMES VI. 411 his castle of Gowrie, on the Tay ; to separate him from his suite, and compel him by threats of instant death, to suffer himself to be carried aboard a boat which should be waiting on the river for the purpose. This was the first act in the projected plot. In the second, the vessel was to push instantly out to sea ; and the royal prisoner was to be conveyed, in a few hours, to an impregnable little fortalice which over hung the German Ocean, and where, if well victualled, a garrison of twenty men could, for months, have defied a royal army. To communicate with England, and administer the government in the royal name, but under the dictation of Gowrie and his faction, would then be easy. It had been repeatedly done before in the history of the country, and very recently in the Raid of Ruthven ; why then should it not be done again ? In all this projected scheme there was some rash ness ; something smacking of youth, audacity, and revenge ; but there was also some sagacity. Since the days of the conspiracy against Riccio, down to the Raid of Ruthven, most of the plots which chequer and stain the history of the country had failed, from admitting too many into their secret. A band or covenant had been drawn up ; a correspondence opened with England ; the envoy at the Scottish court had been admitted to the secret ; the Kirk consulted ; the pulse of the burghs and barons felt ; and so many points presented for suspicion to work on, and trea chery to be rewarded, that success was unlikely, and discovery almost inevitable. That Gowrie had ob served this, and had deeply studied the subject of \" Conspiracies against Princes\" under Machiavel, the most acute of masters, we know from a curious anec dote preserved by Spottiswood. A short time before"], [418, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 412 his unhappy death, a friend found him in the library, with a volume of the great Florentine in his hand. On inquiring the subject of his studies, showing him the book, he observed, that it was a collection of the most famous conspiracies against princes. \"A perilous subject,\" was the reply. \" Yes,\" said the young con spirator ; \" perilous ; because most of such plots have been foolishly contrived, and have embraced too many in the secret. He who goes about such a business, should beware of putting any man on his counsel.\" 1 Under this idea, Gowrie admitted to his secret as few associates as possible ; and his accomplices were men on whom he had the most implicit reliance. They appear to have been only four in number : his brother, Alexander Ruthven, commonly called the Master of Ruthven, who held an office in the king's chamber ; Robert Logan of Restalrig, a border baron, distantly connected with the Gowrie family ; a third person of rank and consequence, but whose name is still a mystery ; and lastly, an old ruffian follower of Logan's, called Laird Bower. Logan was a man already known to Sir Robert Cecil ; who, on making some inquiries regarding him in 1599, received from the celebrated Lord Wylloughby, then governor of Berwick, this brief character of the Scottish border baron : \u2014 \" There is such a Laird of Lesterligg, as you write of : a main loose man ; a great favourer of thieves reputed ; yet a man of a good clan, as they here term it ; and a good fellow.\" 2 The character here given of Logan was far too favourable ; for there 1 Spottiswood, History, p. 460.

The name is sometimes written Lestelrig, some times Restalrig."], [419, "1600. JAMES VI. 413 is no doubt that he was a desperate, reckless, and unprincipled villain, although a person of a good house, and true to his friends, according to the prin ciples of that border code under which he had been bred. He had run through a large estate in every kind of dissipation and excess, was a mocker at religion, had been a constant follower of the notorious Bothwell, and was now drowned in debt ; yet, bad as he was, Laird Bower, his brother conspirator, his chamberlain, or household man, as he termed him, appears to have been a shade blacker. It was to this old borderer that the perilous task was committed, of carrying the letters which passed between Logan and Gowrie. Bower had received his nurture and educa tion in the service of David Hume of Manderston, commonly called \" Davie the Devil ;\" and in this Satanic school had become a more debauched and daring ruffian than his master ; who described him, in writing to Gowrie, as a worthy fellow, who would not spare to ride to HelVs yett x to pleasure him.2 Of the character of the other unknown conspirator nothing can be said, as his name remains yet a shadow. But if we may trust to popular report, Alexander, the Master of Ruthven, was a young man of the highest promise ; amiable, accomplished, gentle almost to a fault, and a universal favourite at court ; yet, strange as it may appear, the execution of that part of the plot requiring the utmost sternness, promp titude, and decision, was committed to this youth. He it was on whom his brother laid the task of decoying the king into Gowrie House, and forcing him into the boat ; whilst Gowrie himself undertook to amuse or intimidate the suite ; and Logan was to 1 Hell's yett, i. e.

Both these mansions, Gowrie House and Fastcastle, were, from their construction and situation, singularly well calculated for the attempt against the king. The first was a large baronial mansion, of quadrangular shape, built in the town of Perth, and on the border of the Tay, the river washing the garden ; and forti fied by a wall which ran along the bank, and was flanked by two strong towers. Its apartments were numerous ; arranged, as was usual iu those times, en suite, and so as to communicate with each other ; and amongst them was a long gallery, which extended along one side of the square, and communicated, by a door at the end, with a chamber which, in its turn, led to a small circular room constructed in the in terior of a turret. This gallery, and the other apart ments, were accessible by a broad oaken staircase ; but the turret, or round room, could be reached also by a back spiral turnpike : so that a person who had entered it through the gallery, might escape, or could be conveyed away without again traversing the prin cipal staircase. Fastcastle, on the coast of Berwickshire, the resi dence or den of Logan, was the very opposite of Gowrie House ; being a single square and massive feudal tower, standing on the brink of a steep and almost perpendicular black rock, which rose to the height of two hundred feet above the German Ocean. From the sea, it was completely inaccessible, unless to those who knew the secret of its steps cut in the rock, and could unlock the iron bolts and doors which defended them ; and on the land side, the isthmus on which it stood was connected with the mainland by so narrow a neck, that any attempt to force its little"], [421, "1600. JAMES VI. 415 drawbridge was hopeless. The distance from Gowrie House to Fastcastle, by sea, was about seventy miles ; from Fastcastle to the English border, about twenty five miles. It is now time to introduce the reader to the most interesting part of this strange story : the letters of the conspirators themselves. It appears from these documents, which were not discovered until many years after the deep tragedy in which the conspiracy concluded, that early in the month of July 1600, Gowrie wrote to Logan appointing a secret meeting, to confer \" on the purpose he knew of.\" This letter is not now in existence ; but it was brief, alluding to what had passed before between them, and stating that Logan's absence in Lothian had prevented Gowrie from coming to see him at Fastcastle.1 On the 18th July, 1600, Logan addressed a letter, which still remains, to the unknown conspirator already men tioned. It was in these terms : \u2014 \" Right honourable Sir, \u2014 My duty with service remembered. Please you understand, my Lord of Go. and some others, his lordship's friends and weil-willers, who tender his lordship's better preferment, are upon the resolution you know, for the revenge of that cause ; and his lordship has written to me anent that purpose ; whereto I will accord, in case you will staud to and bear a part : and before ye resolve, meet me and Mr. A. R. [Alexander Ruthven] in the Canongate on Tuesday the next week ; and be as wary as ye can. Indeed, M. A. R. spoke with me four or five days since; and I have promised his lordship an answer within ten days at farthest. \" As for the purpose, how M. A. R.

A. R. how I think it shall be meetest to be convoyed quietest in a boat by sea ; at which time, upon sure advertisement, I shall have the place very quiet and well provided. \" And as I receive your answer, I will post this bearer to my lord. And therefore, I pray you, as you love your own life, as it is not a matter of mowise,5 be circumspect in all things, and take no fear but all shall be well.\" Logan then went on to warn his friend not to reveal any thing of the plot either to Gowrie's old tutor, Mr. William Rhynd, or to his brother Lord Home, before \" the turn were done.\" He thus con cluded : \u2014 \" When you have read, send this letter back again with the bearer, that I may see it burnt myself; for so is the fashion in such errands ; and, if you please, write your answer on the back hereof, in case ye will take my word for the credit of the bearer.

It only remained to fix the precise day. This appears from the following letter of Logan, sent to the unknown conspirator, from his house in the Canongate, on the 27th of July:\u2014 \" Right honourable Sir, \u2014 All my hartly duty with humble service remembered.

The first proves that the Master of Ruthven and Logan had set down the course or plot for the preferment of Gowrie and the revenge of his father's death ; that the conspirators were to meet at Fastcastle ; and that they had fixed \" the king's hunting \" as the most favourable time for their attempt. Logan, it is seen from the same letter, did not think his brother, Lord Home, or Gowrie's old tutor, Mr. William Rhynd, by any means safe persons to be intrusted with the secret of the conspi racy. In the second letter to Bower, we have a glance at the rich bribe by which Gowrie had secured the assistance of Logan \u2014 the estate of Dirlton ; and in the third, his resolution to keep his promise \"although the scaffold were set up,\" with his expectation to have speedy intimation sent him of the precise day when the attempt was to be made, and his presence required at St. Johnston. Logan's letter to Gowrie is still more minute. It contains the determination to revenge the Machiavelian massacre of their dearest friends; the intended rendezvous of the associates at Fastcastle, who, under the mask of a pleasure party by sea, were to be conveyed into that stronghold ; the previous secret conference to be held at Restalrig over their \" hattit kit and wine ;\" the good cheer and happy suc cess which the king's buck-hunting was to bring them ; the solemn and earnest injunctions of secrecy, \u2014 life and lands, name and fame, hanging on the issue ; the allusion to the strange tale of Padua, so similar to their present purpose, that it seems to have haunted 1 In the General Register-House, Edinburgh."], [431, "1600. JAMES VI. 425 the \" consety\" or high-wrought imagination of Mr. Alexander Ruthven ; the necessity of destroying their letters : all this is contained in Logan's letter to Gowrie himself ; and in his last letter to the un known conspirator, we have the direction how the signal is to be given at sea to those who were to be on the look-out from Fastcastle ; the exultation and joy at Gowrie's frankness and forwardness ; the last consultation appointed to be at Fastcastle ; Logan's candid character of himself, as utterly unable to abide all arguments from religion ; his exhortations to be speedy, and his anticipation of a glorious revenge for the death of \" Grey Steil,\" the affectionate sobriquet or nickname of the late Earl of Gowrie. All this is so clearly established by the correspondence, and so completely proves the existence of Gowrie's plot for the surprise of the king, and the meeting of the con spirators at Fastcastle, that he who doubts must be too desperate in his scepticism to be reached by any evidence whatever. But we must proceed. This last letter of Logan's was written on Thurs day, the 31st July ; and all that passed in the secret conclave of the conspirators, during the three succeed ing days, till the night of Monday the 4th of August, is a blank. On that night Gowrie called his cham berlain, Andrew Henderson, into his bed-chamber and commanded him to be ready to ride on the morrow early with his brother, the Master, to Falkland, and to bring back with speed any letter, or message, which he might receive from him.1 The morning of Tuesday, the 5th of August, found the king and his nobles in the great park at Falkland, ready to mount on horseback, and proceed to their 1 Henderson's Declaration, Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. p. 175."], [432, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 426 sport. It was still early, between six and seven o'clock : all was bustle and preparation ; and the king stood beside the stables surrounded by his hounds and huntsmen, when Alexander Ruthven, Gowrie's younger brother, came up, and, with a low courtesy, kneeling and uncovering, craved a moment's private audience on matter of the utmost moment. His ex- pression was perturbed, his manner hurried ; and the king, expecting a communication of importance, walked aside with him. Ruthven then declared, that he, the evening before, had met a suspicious-looking fellow without the walls of St. Johnston, with his face muffled in a cloak ; and, perceiving him to be terrified and astonished when questioned, he had seized him ; and, on searching, had found a large pot full of gold pieces under his cloak. This treasure, with the man who carried it, he had secured, he said, in a small chamber in Gowrie House ; and he now begged the king to ride with him to Perth on the instant, and make sure of it for himself, as he had not even revealed the dis- covery to his brother the earl. James at first dis- claimed having any right to money thus found ; but when the Master, to one of his questions, stated that it seemed foreign gold, the vision of crowns of the sun and Spanish priests rose to the royal suspicion ; and he was about to despatch some servant of his own, to ride instantly with a warrant to the provost, and seize the treasure, when Ruthven strongly pro- tested against it : declaring that if either the magis trates or Gowrie got their fingers on the gold, it might chance that very few pieces would ever come into his majesty's purse ; and that all that he implored, in re- compense for his fidelity, was that the king would ride with him to Perth, see the treasure, and judge with his own eyes."], [433, "1600. JAMES VI. 427 The court was now on horseback; the morning wearing on ; the baying of the hounds, and cheering of the huntsmen, told that the game was found ; and the king, impatiently putting an end to the interview, promised Ruthven an answer after he had killed the buck. James then galloped off; but the story haunted him ; and on the first check he sent for Ruthven, who lingered near at hand, and whispered to him that he had resolved, the moment the chase was over, to accompany him to Perth. The young man instantly despatched Andrew Henderson, the chamberlain, who, in obedience to Gowrie's orders the night before, had, with Andrew Ruthven, accompanied him to Falkland ; bidding him gallop to Perth, and tell Gowrie that the king would be there within a brief space, and slenderly attended. When the chase was ended, which lasted till near eleven, the king surprised his courtiers by telling them he meant to ride immediately to St. Johnston, to speak with the Earl of Gowrie ; and without giving himself or his nobles time to send for fresh horses, or waiting, as was usual, for the \" curry of the deer,\" 1 he rode off with Ruthven at so furious a pace, that he was some miles on the road before Lennox, or any of his suite, overtook him. All this time Ruthven had been agitated and restless ; now pressing the king to finish the chase; now urging him not to wait for fresh horses ; now insisting that neither Lennox, Mar, nor any number of his nobles should follow him, as it might spoil all ; and this to such a degree that James, as he pushed on, began to suspect and hesitate, and calling Lennox aside, told him the strange errand he was riding on ; asking him if Ruthven, his brother- 1 French, curer ; to cleanse ; the ripping up and cleansing the deer."], [434, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 428 in-law, had ever shown any symptoms of derangement. The duke pronounced the story utterly improbable ; but affirmed he had never seen any thing like madness in Ruthven. \" At all events,\" said James, \" do not you, Lennox, fail to follow me into the room where this fellow and his treasure is.\" This private con ference was not unobserved by Ruthven. He had a short time before despatched his other servant, Andrew Ruthven, to ride forward with a second message to Perth, and now coming up close, to the king, implored him to make none living acquainted with their pur pose, till he had himself seen the fellow and the treasure. It seems to have been at this moment that Sir Thomas Erskine, who had overtaken the king on the road, privately asked Lennox how it came that Ruthven had got the king's ear, and carried off his majesty from his sport ; to which Lennox jocularly answered, \" Peace, man ; we shall all be turned into gold.\" 1 The whole party then rode forward ; and on coming within a mile of Perth, Ruthven, telling the king he must give warning to his brother, galloped on before. We must now for a moment turn to Gowrie, whom Henderson, on his arrival at Gowrie House, found, with two friends, in his chamber. He instantly left them, and inquired, secretly and earnestly, what word he had brought from his brother : had he sent a letter ; how had the king taken with the Master ; who were with his majesty at the hunting, many or few; what noblemen, what names ? To these hurried questions Henderson answered by giving the message sent by young Ruthven \u2014 that the king would be with him incontinent, and he must prepare dinner. He added, Lloyd's Worthies, p. 783."], [435, "JAMES VI. 1600. 429 that James had received the Master kindly, and laid his hand on his shoulder when he did his courtesy : that his majesty had sundry of his own suite with him, and some Englishmen ; and that the only noble man he noticed was my lord duke. This was at ten o'clock.1 Henderson then went to his own house, pulled off his boots, and returned to Gowrie House about eleven, when the earl commanded him to put on his \"secret,2 and plate sleeves,\" as he would require his assistance to seize a Highlandman in the Shoe Gate. At half-past twelve Gowrie took his dinner, having, as his guests, three friends of the neighbour hood ; and as they sat at table, Andrew Ruthven, the Master's second messenger, entered the room, and whispered to the earl. Soon after came the Master himself, upon which Gowrie and his friends rose ; and now for the first time openly alluding to the royal visit, he assembled his servants, and walked to the Inch or meadow near the town, where he met the king. James's train did not exceed twelve or fifteen per sons, including Lennox, Mar, Sir Thomas Erskine, John Ramsay his page, Dr. Hugh Herries, Lords Lindores and Inchaffray, with a few others. They wore their green hunting-dresses, and were wholly without armour ; a horn slung over their shoulder, and a sword or deer-knife at their girdle, being all they carried. Gowrie's servants and followers amounted nearly to fourscore ; but many of these must have been townsmen and lookers-on. On coming to Gowrie House the king called for a drink, and was somewhat annoyed at having to wait long for his welcome cup, and more than an hour for his dinner. During this 1 Henderson's Declaration, Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. p. 176. 2 A secret shirt of mail worn under the clothes."], [436, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 430 interval, Alexander Ruthven sent for the key of the long room, called the Gallery Chamber, which imme diately adjoined the cabinet where the king dined. At the end of this gallery was another apartment, which opened into a circular room, formed in the interior of a turret ; and this room, it is important to observe, could be entered, not only by the door at the end of the gallery, but by another door communicat ing with a back -stair or turnpike, called the Black Turnpike. Soon after the king had sat down to din ner, Gowrie, who waited upon him, sent for Hender son, and taking him aside secretly, bade him go to his brother in the gallery. He obeyed ; found Mr. Alex ander there, and almost instantly after was joined by the earl himself, wdio commanded him to remain where he was, and obey the Master's orders.1 Hen derson was now fully armed, all except the head : he had noted that the tale about seizing a Highland thief in the Shoe Gate was a false pretence ; and be ginning to suspect some treason, asked in an agitated tone, what they wTere about to do with him? The only reply of Gowrie and the Master was to point to the little chamber, make him enter the door, and lock him up. All this occupied but a few minutes, and Gowrie then returned to the king, who was sitting at his dessert ; whilst the duke and the rest of the suite were dining in the next room. They had nearly finished their repast, when James, in a bantering manner, accused Gowrie of having been so long in foreign parts as to have forgotten his Scottish courtesies. \" Wherefore, my lord,\" said he, \" since ye have neglected to drink either to me or my nobles, who 1 Henderson's Declaration, Pilcairn, vol. ii. p. 177."], [437, "1600. JAMES VI. 431 are your guests, I must drink to you my own welcome. Take this cup, and pledge them the king's scoll1 in my name.\" Gowrie, accordingly, calling for wine, joined the duke and his fellows, who were getting up from table ; and at this instant Alexander Ruthven seizing the moment when the king was alone, whispered him that now was the time to go. James, rising up, bade him call Sir Thomas Erskine; but he evaded the message, and Erskine never received it. Lennox, too, remembering the king's injunctions, spoke of following his majesty ; but Gowrie prevented him, saying, his highness had retired on a quiet errand, and would not be disturbed ; 2 after which, he opened the door leading to his pleasure-ground, and wdth Lennox, Lindores, and some others, passed into the garden. Thus really cut off from assistance, but believing that he would be followed by Lennox or Erskine, James now followed Ruthven up a stair, and through a suite of various chambers, all of them opening into each other, the Master locking every door as they passed ; and observing, with a smile, that now they had the fellow sure enough. At last they entered the small round room already mentioned. On the wall hung a picture with a curtain before it ; beside it stood a man in armour ; and as the king started back in alarm, Ruthven locked the door, put on his hat, drew the dagger from the side of the armed man, and tearing the curtain from the picture, showed the well-known features of the late Earl of Gowrie, his father. \"Whose face is that?\" said he, advancing the datro-er with one hand to the king's breast, and Go \u00b0 pointing with the other to the picture. \" Who mur dered my father? Is not thy conscience burdened 1 The king's scoll ; the king's health. 2 Lennox's Declaration, Pitcaira, vol. ii. p. 172."], [438, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 432 by his innocent blood ? Thou art now my prisoner, and must be content to follow our will, and to be used as we list. Seek not to escape; utter but a cry, [James was now looking at the window, and begin ning to speak ;] make but a motion to open the window, and this dagger is in thy heart.\" The king, although alarmed by this fierce address, and the suddenness of the danger, did not lose his presence of mind : and as Henderson was evidently no willing accomplice, he took courage to remonstrate with the Master ; reminded him of the dear friendship he had borne him ; and \" as for your father's death,\" said he, \" I had no hand in it ; it was my council's doing ; and should ye now take my life, what preferment will it bring you ? Have I not both sons and daughters ? You can never be king of Scotland ; and I have many good subjects who will revenge my death.\" Ruthven seemed struck with this, and swore he neither wanted his blood nor his life. \" What racks 1 it then,\" said the king, \" that you should not take off your hat in your prince's presence?\" Upon this Ruthven un covered, and James resumed. \" What crave ye, an ye seek not my life ?\" \u2014 \" But a promise, Sir,\" was the reply. \" What promise ? \"\u2014 \" Sir,\" said Ruthven, \" my brother will tell you.\" \" Go, fetch him, then,\" rejoined the king ; and to induce him to obey, he gave his oath, that till his return he would neither cry out nor open the window. Ruthven consented ; commanded Henderson to keep the king at his peril ; and left the room, locking the door behind him. James now, for a moment, had time to breathe ; and turning to Henderson, he asked him how he came there. The unhappy man declared he had been shut 1 What racks ; what forbid--."], [439, "1600. JAMES VI. 433 in like a dog. Would Gowrie do him any mischief ? Henderson answered he should die first. \" Open the window, then,\" said James ; and scarce had this been done, or rather when it was being done, Ruthven broke into the room again, and swearing there was no remedy, ran in upon the king, seized him by the wrists, and attempted to bind him with a garter or silk cord which he had in his hands. James, by a strong effort, threw himself loose, exclaiming he was a free prince, and would never be bound ; and Hen derson at this moment wrenching away the cord, the king \" leapt free,\" and had almost reached the window, when Ruthven again seized him by the throat with one hand, and thrust the other into his mouth to prevent him giving the alarm. But James, now rendered desperate, and exerting his utmost strength, dragged his assailant to the window, and throwing his head half out, though Ruthven's hand was still on his throat, cried out, \" Treason ! help ! Earl of Mar, I am murdered !\" Ruthven then dragged him back into the chamber, upbraiding Henderson as a cowardly villain, who would bring death upon them all, and attempted to draw his sword, which James prevented by grasping his right hand.1 Henderson during this, unlocked the door of the room, and then stood trem bling and panic-struck, whilst a desperate wrestle continued between the king and Ruthven. Leaving James in this struggle for life, we must turn for an instant to Gowrie, who had led Lennox and the other courtiers into the garden. Whilst there, Cranston, one of his attendants, ran up, and informed them that the king had left the castle by the back way, and was riding over the Inch, upon which Gowrie 1 Henderson's Declaration in Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 178. VOL. VII. 2 E"], [440, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 434 called to horse; and he, Lennox, and the rest, hurry ing down the great staircase, and shouting for their horses, some one asked the porter in the court-yard, if the king had passed. He declared he had not ; and persisted in his denial, although his master abused him as a lying varies. Gowrie, upon this, ran back into the house, observing to Mar, he would ascertain the truth ; and returning within a few minutes, assured them that the king had really gone forth, and must now have reached the South Inch. Scarcely, however, was this falsehood uttered, when it was confuted ; for at this moment James's loud cry of treason and murder was heard ; and, looking up, they saw the king's face at the window of the turret, the features red and flushed with exertion, and a hand on his throat.1 All was now horror and confusion. Sir Thomas Erskine collared Gowrie, exclaiming, \" Traitor, thou shalt die ! This is thy work !\" but was felled to the ground by Andrew Ruthven, whilst GowTrie asserted his innocence. Lennox's first impulse was to save the king; and he, Mar, and some others, rushed up the great staircase to the hall ; but finding the door locked, began to batter it with a ladder which lay hard by.2 John Ramsay, one of the royal suite, was more fortunate. He remembered the back entry ; and running swiftly up the turnpike stair to the top, dashed open the door of the round chamber with his foot, and found himself in the presence of the king and Ruthven, who wTere wrestling in the middle of the chamber. James, with Ruthven's head under his arm, had thrown him down almost on his knees, whilst the Master still grasped the king's throat.3 1 Lennox's Declaration, Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 173.

JAMES VI. 435 Ramsay was hampered by a hawk, a favourite bird of James's, which he held on his wrist ; but throwing her off, and drawing his whinger,1 he made an ineffec tual blow at Ruthven ; the king calling out to strike low, as the traitor had on a pyne doublet.2 Ramsay then stabbed him twice in the lower part of the body. The king, making a strong effort, pushed him back wards through the door, down the stairs ; and at this moment Sir Thomas Erskine and Dr. Herries rushing up the turnpike, and encountering the unhappy youth, bleeding, and staggering upon the steps, despatched him with their swords. As he lay in his last agony, he turned his face to them, and said, feebly, \" Alas ! I had not the wyte o't.\" s All this passed so rapidly, that Ramsay had only time to catch a glance of a figure in armour, standing near the king, but motionless. When he next looked, it had disappeared. This seeming apparition was Henderson, still trembling, and in amazement, from the scene he had witnessed ; but who, seeing the door open, glided down the turnpike, and, as it turned out, fled instantly from the house ; passing, in his flight, over the Master's dead body.4 At this moment, as Erskine and Ramsay were congratulating the king, a new tumult was heard at the end of the gallery ; and they had scarcely time to hurry James into the ad joining chamber, when Gowrie himself, furious from passion, and armed with a rapier in each hand, rushed along the gallery, followed by seven of his servants, with drawn swords. His vengeance had been roused 1 Whinger ; a hunting knife. 2 Pyne doublet ; a concealed shirt of mail worn under the clothes. 3 I had not the blame of it. 4 Henderson's Declaration, Ramsay's Declaration, and Sir Thomas Erskine's Declaration, all printed in Pitcairn, vol. ii. pp. 175-184 in- clusive."], [442, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 436 to the utmost pitch, by his having stumbled over the bleeding body of his brother ; and swearing a dreadful oath that the traitors who had murdered him should die, he threw himself desperately upon Erskine and his companions, who were all wounded in the first onset, and fought at great odds, there being eight to four.1 Yet the victory was not long doubtful ; for, some one calling out that the king was slain, Gowrie, as if paralysed with horror, dropt the points of his weapons, and Ramsay, throwing himself within his guard, passed his sword through his body, and slew him on the spot. The servants, seeing their master fall, gave way, and were driven out of the gallery ; and Lennox, Mar, and the rest, who were still thun dering with their hammers on the outside of the great door, having made themselves known to the king and his friends within, were joyfully admitted. So effec tually, however, had Ruthven secured this door, that it was only by passing a hammer through one of the shattered boards, and with it forcibly wrenching off the lock, that their entrance was effected. The first thing that met their eyes was the dead body of Gowrie lying on the floor, and the king standing unharmed beside it, although still breathless from the recent struggle, and disordered in his dress. At this mo ment Grahame of Balgone, one of the gentlemen who had accompanied the king from Falkland, found a silk garter lying amongst the bent, or rough grass with which the floor of the round chamber was covered ; and James immediately recognised it as the same with which Ruthven had attempted to bind his hands.2 1 Thomas Robertson's Declaration, Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 196 ; also, ibid. p. 197 ; Ramsay's Declaration, ibid. pp. 183, 184 ; and Sir Thomas Erskine's Declaration, ibid. p. 182 j William Robertson's Declaration, ibid. p. 197. 2 Grahame's Declaration, Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 184; also, p. 217."], [443, "1600. JAMES VI. 437 The king then knelt down, and, surrounded by his nobles, who were all on their knees, devoutly thanked God for his deliverance; and prayed that the life which had been thus signally preserved, might be devoted to the welfare of his people. Scarcely, however, had they risen from their act of gratitude, when a new danger began to threaten them. The city bell was heard ringing, mingled with shouts and cries of vengeance, from an immense mob who beset the outside of Gowrie House, and threatened to blow it up, and bury them in the ruins. Andrew Ruthven and Violet Ruthven, two near relatives of the family of Gowrie, had been busy in rousing the citizens ; and, running wildly through the streets, vented curses and maledictions on \" the bloody butchers\" who had murdered their young provost and his brother. Nor did many spare to threaten the king himself; crying out, \" Come down, come down, thou son of Seignor Davie ! thou hast slain a better man than thyself. Come down, green coats, thieves and traitors ! limmers that have slain these innocents. May God let never nane o' you have such plants of your ain I\"1 Amid this hubbub, and storm of lamen tation and vengeance, James ordered the magistrates to be admitted into the house ; and having informed them of all that had happened, commanded them to silence the alarum-bell, and quiet the people on their peril ; which they at last with difficulty effected. He then ordered them to take care of the dead bodies ; and on searching Gowrie's person, there was found in the pocket of his doublet, a little parchment bag full of \" magical characters and words of enchantment,\" which his tutor, Rhynd, recognised as the same he 1 Grahame's Declaration, Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. pp. 197, 198, 199."], [444, "1600.

James now took horse, and although it was already eight in the evening, rode to Falkland amid crowds of his subjects, who poured in from all quarters to testify their joy at his escape. Next day, the news having been brought to Edinburgh, nothing could exceed the enthusiastic demonstrations of the city ; and the same scene was repeated, with still louder and more affec tionate welcome, when the king, after a brief retire ment at Falkland, passed over the Forth, and entered his capital. The Cross was hung with tapestry ; the whole city, led by the judges and magistrates, met him on the sands at Leith ; and from thence be rode in triumph, and amid an immense congregation of all classes of his people, to the Cross, where Mr. Patrick Galloway preached to the multitude, gave the story of the treason, and described the miraculous escape of the monarch. His sermon still remains, an ex traordinary specimen of the pulpit eloquence of the times.3 1 Declaration of Rhynd, Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. pp. 218, 219, 220. 8 Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. p. 248."], [445, "1600.

[ PbUip III. | Clement VIII. The general gratulation manifested at the escape of the king from the treason of Gowrie, was not without its alloy. Though almost all believed in the reality of the conspiracy, a section of the Kirk demurred and doubted ; and as the death of both the brothers had involved the particulars of the plot in extreme obscu rity, the ministers not only declared it questionable that any treason had been intended, but, after a while, started the extravagant theory that the plot was a conspiracy of the king against Gowrie, not of Gowrie against the king. To examine or refute this hypo thesis, after the facts which have been given, would be worse than idle ; and we are not to be surprised that the incredulity of the Kirk should have incensed the king. But James adopted an unwise mode of refutation. Instead of simply insisting on the great features of the story, on the leading facts which were indisputably proved by the evidence of Lennox, Mar, Erskine, and Ramsay, and throwing aside all minor matters and apparent contradictions, which, consider-"], [446, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 440 ing the rapidity, terror, and tumult accompanying the event, confirmed rather than weakened the proof: he forgot his dignity ; held repeated conferences with the recusant ministers ; argued, cavilled, remonstrated, and attempted in vain to explain and reconcile every minute particular. The effect of all this was precisely what might have been anticipated : Mr. Robert Bruce, and his little sceptical conclave of brethren, were quite as ingenious in their special pleading as the king ; and not only obstinately refused to accuse Gowrie in their pulpits of any plot against the royal person, but inso lently insinuated that their two favourites had been murdered. James, finding them immoveable, banished them from the capital; and interdicted them, under pain of death, from preaching in any part of Scotland. This severity brought four of the recusants, Bal canquel, Watson, Hall, and Balfour, to reason ; and they declared themselves thoroughly satisfied of the truth of Gowrie's treason. But Bruce was inexorable. He considered that the question involved not only the truth of the conspiracy, but the spiritual independence of the Kirk ; peremptorily refused to exculpate the king, or believe in his report ; and was banished to France. 1 Extreme measures were then adopted against the family of Ruthven ; and in a parliament which assembled in the succeeding month of Novem ber, the revolting spectacle was exhibited of the trial for treason of the livid corpses of these unhappy brothers ; which, after the doom of forfeiture had been pronounced, were hauled to the gibbet, hanged and quartered. Their quarters were then exposed in the most conspicuous places of Perth, Stirling, and Dundee, and their heads fixed on the top of the prison 1 Spottiswood, p. 461."], [447, "1600. JAMES VI. 441 in Edinburgh. Nor was the ignominy heaped upon the dead greater than the severity against the living. An attempt was made, on the very night of the cata strophe, to seize the two younger brothers of the house, who, at the time, were living with their unhappy mother at Dunkeld ; but a vague report of danger had reached her, and they had escaped in disguise, accompanied by their tutor, who brought them in safety to Berwick.1 On the king's return to Falkland, on the night of the 5th of August, the sister of Gowrie, Mrs. Beatrix Ruthven, who was maid of honour to the queen, was dismissed and banished from court. By an act of the same par liament which inflicted the forfeiture, the very name of Ruthven was abolished ; and the brethren and posterity of the house of Gowrie declared to be for ever incapable of enjoying inheritance, place, or dig nity, in Scotland. Such was the avidity with which the favourites of the court sought, for their own pro fit, to hunt down this ill-fated family, and fulfil the stern wishes of the king, that but for the generous protection of England, not a male of the house of Ruthven would have been left. The relations between Elizabeth and James, pre vious to the conspiracy, had been, we have seen, far from friendly ; and this connivance of the queen at the concealment of the young Ruthvens, with other suspicious reports which arose immediately after the catastrophe, created a strong impression in the mind of the king that the plot had been fostered in England. It was remembered that Gowrie had been admitted, immediately previous to the attempt, into the most intimate confidence of the English queen ; it was 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

The Earl of Mar accused Lord Wylloughby, the governor of Berwick, to the king, as being privy to the plot ; but his only evidence seems to have been Wylloughby's intimacy with Gowrie at the court of England; and this high minded and brave soldier deeming his character far above such suspicion, did not condescend to confute the charge.1 All these things, however made an impression. When Nicolson assured the king of his devout thankfulness for his escape, the only answer he received, was an incredulous smile from James ; and many of the highest rank in Scotland, and best entitled to credit, persisted in tracing the whole conspiracy to England. Many, on the other hand, insisted on the total want of all direct evidence of Gowrie's guilt ; and as the letters of Logan of Res talrig had not then come to light, it was difficult to confute sceptics. Cranston, Craigengelt, and Baron, all of them servants of Gowrie, who were executed for their participation in the enterprise, had been examined by torture ; and both in the agony of the \" boots,\" and afterwards on the scaffold, confessed nothing which could implicate their unhappy master or themselves; and the letters of Nicolson, Lord Scrope, and Sir William Bowes, made little scruple of throwing the chief guilt upon the king. 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 6th August, 1600.

Her anger had been raised on a subject which never failed to produce in her mind unusual excitement \u2014 James's intrigues as to the succession ; and after a few lines on her joy at his escape, she attacked him in the following bitter terms on his impatience for her death, and the inde cent haste of his preparations : \u2014 \" And though a king I be, yet hath my funerals been prepared, as I hear, long ere, I suppose, their labour shall be needful ; and do hear too much of that daily, as I may have a good memorial that I am mortal : and withall so be they, too, that make such preparation aforehand ; whereat I smile, supposing that such facts may make them readier for it than I. \" Think not but how wilily soever things be carried, they are so well known that they may do more harm to others than to me. Of this my pen hath run farther than at first I meant, when the memory of a prince's end made me call to mind such usage, which too many countries talks of, and I cannot stop my ears from. If you will needs know what I mean, I have been pleased to impart to this my servant some part thereof; to whom I will refer me ; and will pray God to give you grace to know what best becomes you. \" Your loving Sister and Cousin.\"1 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Royal Letters, Scotland.

It was mortifying enough to a princess clinging, as still she did, to the last remnant of life and glory, to know that her subjects (as she bitterly said) \" were looking to the rising sun ;\" but to find them in the very act of worship, chafed her to the quick : and perhaps nothing weighed heavier against Essex, than his suspected favour for James. There is a remarkable paper preserved, in which Ashfield gave his opinion to the Scottish king on the best mode of accomplishing his great object ; and although no letters between James and Essex have been discovered, there seems to be little doubt that this unfortunate nobleman, now a prisoner in the Tower, had engaged to support the claim of the Scot tish monarch with the whole weight of his influence. In his advices, Ashfield complimented James on the wisdom and judgment which had distinguished his policy towards the state and people of England. It was a great matter, he observed, that none feared his future government, or had taken offence at his person. He instructed him to employ every effort to gain the common lawyers, who possessed the \" gainfullest \" offices ; were rich and politic men ; more feared than beloved by the people, yet very powerful in the state. He ought next, he said, to secure the clergy, who possessed the greatest influence in the universities; were rich ; and had most of the people, and many of"], [451, "1600. JAMES VI. 445 the nobility and gentry at their devotion. He should assure them that he had no intention of altering the state of religion, or their livings; which, according to the then computation of the parishes in England, amounted to nine thousand seven hundred and twenty seven. And if (Ashfield added) the king declared his inclination to exempt them from the heavy taxes which they now paid, it would go far to bring over the whole body to his service. He also advised the king to have letters ready, at the time of Elizabeth's death, to some one or two of the chiefest \"men of command\" in every shire and corporation, and pro mised to procure him a list, not only of the names of such, but also of the collectors and tellers of the crown rents in England, to whom he might give speedy and special directions, by gracious letters, and win them to his service. His last remark related to the \" citizens of London,\" a body of men whom he described as rich, strong, and well governed ; who would stand firm to the preservation of their wrealth, and keep themselves neutral till they saw which of the competitors was likely to prove the strongest, and how the game would go.1 Immediately after the meeting of that parliament, in November, in which the forfeiture of the Gowries took place, some unhappy differences broke out be tween the king and his queen ; this princess having shown a deeper commiseration for the Ruthven family than James approved of. Amongst the innumerable reports which had arisen, after the catastrophe, it had been whispered that jealousy had lent its sting to the royal wrath. But although Anne of Denmark was sufficiently gay and thoughtless to give some ground 1 MS. British Museum, Julius, F. vi. 133."], [452, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1600. 446 for the imputation, the common story of her passion for the Master of Ruthven seems to rest on nothing more than the merest rumour. She imprudently had given her countenance to that party at court which opposed the extreme severity of the king. It was reported that she had secretly sent for Beatrix Ruth- ven, and favoured her with a midnight interview in the palace. She suspected that intrigues were carrying on against her ; and, on one occasion, if we may believe Nicolson the envoy of Elizabeth, was so far overcome by passion, that she openly upbraided James with a plot for her imprisonment ; and warned him that he would not find her so easy a prey as an Earl of Gowrie. The probability, however, is, that all this was much exaggerated by the gossiping propensities of Nicol- son : for the royal couple, whom he represented as on very evil terms on the 31st of October, had been described, in a letter written only two days before, as exceedingly loving, and almost ultra-uxorious.1 In the midst of this alternate matrimonial shade and sunshine, Anne gave birth to a prince, afterwards the unfortunate Charles the First ; whose baptism was held, with great state and pageantry, on the 30th of December.2 Captain Preston, James's ambassador, now returned from the court of England, and brought a more ami cable letter from the queen than her former ironical epistle. In speaking of Gowrie's treason, she declared her fervent wishes, that \"the bottom of such a can kered malady should be fathomed to the uttermost ; \" and in alluding to the sorceries of the earl, and the familiar spirits who were said to wait on his will, MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 28th Oct. 1600.

He revealed to her all the secret intelligence he had received from Spain, and promised his utmost efforts to raise a force of two thousand Highland soldiers, to act as auxili aries with the English army in Ireland.2 When this proposal, however, afterwards came before the con vention of the three estates, many of the Highlanders and Islesmen sternly refused to bear arms against the Irish ; a race to whom they were linked, they said, by common descent, and a common language ; whilst the Saxons, or English, whose battles they were to fight, had long been the bitter enemies, both of themselves and their Irish ancestors. What impression English gold might have made on these patriotic scruples is not certain ; for, before the muster could be made, a signal victory of the deputy, Lord Mountjoy, over the united forces of Tyrone and the Spaniards, rendered all foreign assistance unnecessary.3 The fate of Essex, who now lay a condemned prisoner in the Tower, was a subject of deep interest to James. 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Royal Letters.

No letters from Essex to James, or from the king to Essex, have been preserved ; at least none have been discovered : and the assertion of Rapin, which has been more or less copied by all suc ceeding English historians, that James was actually a fellow-conspirator with him in his insane project for the seizure of the queen's person, and that it was a part of their plot to dethrone Elizabeth and crown James, is utterly improbable, and supported by no evidence whatever. That the king, in common with all who knew him best, esteemed and admired Essex, and that Essex had written to James after his return from Ireland, is, however, certain ; nor is it at all im probable that the English earl had laboured to estrange the Scottish monarch from Cecil, and to persuade him that the secretary was an enemy to his claim, and favoured the title of the Infanta. There undoubtedly was a time, as we learn from James's secret instruc tions to Burlie,1 (whom he despatched in 1601 to the Grand Duke of Tuscany,) when the Scottish king hesitated whether it would be best to secure the aid of the party of Essex or of Cecil in his secret nego tiations with England ; but the defeat and imprison ment of this unfortunate nobleman convinced him that his case was desperate ; and there is an expres sion in one of James's memoranda, from which we may infer, that to conciliate Elizabeth he had meanly sent her one of Essex's letters to himself. However this may be, the Scottish king, some time before the trial of Essex, had determined to communi cate with Elizabeth, on some points wherein he found 1 Hailes' Cecil Correspondence, p. 112,"], [455, "1600-1.

They set off towards the middle of February 1601,1 with a gallant suite of more than forty persons ; and on their arrival at Berwick, were received by the governor, Lord Wylloughby ; who gathered from them, in the course of their brief intercourse, that the chief object of their mission was to congratulate the English queen on her escape from the treason of Essex, and to remon strate against the reception and relief of Gowrie's brothers in England.2 In their conversations with this nobleman, they appear to have avoided any allu sion to the probable fate of Essex ; yet that James had directed them to intercede for his friend cannot he doubted. His compassion, however, came too late ; for Essex was beheaded before the ambassadors reached London. The original instructions for their mission have not been preserved ; but a letter of their royal master to Mar and Kinloss, written soon after their arrival, opens up to us much of its secret history. The real purpose for which they went, was to feel the pulse of the English nobility and people on the great subject of the succession ; to secure friends ; to dis cover and undermine opponents ; to conciliate the queen, and, if possible, procure from her a more dis- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, Feb. 15, 1600-1.

Many others had been forward in offer ing their assistance ; and to all he prudently gave a cordial reception ; but to Cecil alone he looked as the man who had the game in his hand, and whom he described in his letter of instructions as \" king there in effect.\" 1 On the first audience of Mar and Kinloss, how ever, all seemed likely to miscarry. From the cold ness and jealousy of Elizabeth, she appeared to resent some expressions in the king's sealed letter, written wholly in his own hand, and expostulating with her, in very decided terms, against her too easy belief of the unjust imputations so generally circulated against him. He declared that he was impelled by their long friendship and her own example, to unbosom his griefs, and not to suffer any misconstrued thoughts against her actions to take harbour in his heart ; for which purpose, having already experienced the mis chief which both had suffered from the employment of inferior diplomatic agents, he had now sent one of his highest nobles, the Earl of Mar, and one of his wisest councillors, the Abbot of Kinloss; both of them men of known and constant affection to the continuance of the amity between the two nations and their sovereigns ; and whom he had fully in structed to deal with all \"that honest plainness 1 Secret Correspondence of Sir R.

She would give, she said, no ready money ; but, if he continued to deserve it, his pension should be augmented ; and in the meantime, it would be well if he, who boasted of his services against the common enemy, would cease all traffic with Spain, and receive less frequent messages from Rome. As to Lady Lennox's lands, which he claimed so confidently, he should not receive a fraction of their rents; his title to them, she thought, was still in nubibus ; and till he made it out more clearly, the estates were in safe hands. For the other matters, on which they had shown themselves so importunate, they were of too delicate and important a nature to be suddenly handled ; and she wondered, she said, at the boldness and perseverance with which they had pressed upon her, and dared to broach to her council, so forbidding a subject.2 This, of course, alluded to the succession ; 1 State-paper Office, Royal Letters, Scotland, James to Elizabeth, wholly in the king's own hand, 10th February, 1601. 2 MS. letter, British Museum, Titus, C. vii. f. 124, Elizabeth to James, 11th May, 1601."], [458, "452 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1601. which, reminding her of the probability of her near dissolution, proved unpalatable in the extreme ; so that the ambassadors wrote to the king in the lowest spirits, and strongly remonstrated with Secretary Cecil on their strange reception. Nothing in the world, they said, in addressing this minister, but their uncomfortable experience, could have persuaded them that his royal mistress would have treated the offers which regarded her own safety, and the welfare of her people, with so little regard ; whilst, on the other hand, she gave so ready an ear to the enemies of their mas ter, and the vile slanders which had been circulated against him. They must make bold to tell him, that there was a great difference between vigilancy and credulity; and that it formed no part of wisdom, \"ponere rumores ante salutem.\"1 It is interesting to attend to the directions which this unpromising state of things drew from the Scot tish king. The ambassadors, it wrould appear, had sought his instructions as to the terms in which they ought to leave the English queen, if she continued in this unpropitious and distant temper. \" As to your doubt,\" said he, \" in what sort to leave there,2 it must be according to the answer you receive to the former demands : for if ye be well satisfied therein, then must ye have a sweet and kind parting ; but if ye get no thing but a flat and obstinate denial, which I do surely look for, then are ye, in both the parts of your com mission, to behave yourself thus : \u2014 \" First, ye must be the more careful, since ye come so little speed in your public employment with the queen, to set forward so much the more your private 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, D. ii. f. 470, Earl of Mar and Mr. Bruce abbot of Kinloss to Secretary Cecil, April 29, 1601. 5 To leave there, i. e. in what terms you take your leave."], [459, "1601.

Nor were his sentiments and instructions less sound with regard to Secretary Cecil, and those other powerful nobles whom he, at this time, suspected of hostility to his claim, and from whom he had expected better things. \" You shall plainly declare,\" said he, \" to Mr. Secre tary and his followers, that since now, when they are in their kingdom, they wdll thus misknow me, when the chance shall turn I shall cast a deaf ear to their requests : and whereas now I would have been content to have given them, by your means, a pre assurance of my favour, if at this time they had pressed to deserve the same ; so now they, contemning it, may may be assured never hereafter to be heard, but all the queen's hard usage of me to be hereafter craved at their hands.\"2 This last menace, however, was wholly unnecessary. Cecil, whose prudence had led him, for some years past, to keep aloof from the King of Scots, and to conciliate the favour of his royal mistress by turning a deaf ear to all proposals from that suspected quarter, was too acute a courtier, and too keenly alive to his 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir R.

Elizabeth's health was completely shat tered ; and however earnestly she struggled to conceal the truth from herself, or to assume her usual gaiety before her people, it was but too evident that, after her long and proud walk of glory and strength, her feet were beginning to stumble upon the dark mountain ; and that the time could not be very far distant when the silver cord must be loosed, and the golden bowl be broken. With this prospect before him, Cecil opened, with extraordinary caution, and the most solemn in junctions and oaths of concealment,1 a negotiation with Mar and Kinloss ; and James, who had hitherto suspected him, not only welcomed the advances, but soon gave him his full confidence, and intrusted every thing to his management and address. How all this was effected, wdtat were the steps which led from dis trust to reconciliation, and from this to undoubting and almost exclusive confidence, cannot be ascertained ; but two facts are certain and full of meaning: the first, that Cecil, as appears by a paper preserved at Hatfield, advanced ten thousand pounds out of his own pocket to James, which was never repaid ; the second, that this able diplomatist, from being first minister to Elizabeth, upon the death of his mistress stepped at once, without question or opposition, into the same high office under James. Meanwhile the Scottish ambassadors profited by this secret influence ; and acting under the instructions of one who had the deepest insight into the character of the queen and the state of the country, were able 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir R. Cecil, pp. 190, 191 ; also, pp. 202, 203."], [462, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1601. 456 to follow out their instructions with infinitely greater success than on their first arrival. After a residence of three months in England,1 they returned to James in the beginning of June ; and although all had not succeeded to the extent of his wishes, the assurances which they brought from Elizabeth were friendly and encouraging. She expressed her astonishment, indeed, that the king should have again pressed upon her the same disagreeable matter, on which she had hoped he was already satisfied. It was a bold thing, she said, for any subject of hers to communicate with the King of Scots on so great a cause, without her privity ; and he had done well to address her openly : for he might assure himself that she alone could do him good : all byways would turn to dust and smoke. As to his griefs, to which he alluded in his letter, her conscience acquitted her of every action which should give him the slightest annoyance ; yet she took it kindly that he had unbosomed them, and had sent her so \" well chosen a couple\" as Mar and Kinloss. Her letter concluded with this warning, embodied in her usual style of mystery and innuendo : \u2014 \" Let not shades deceive you, which may take away best substance. * * * An upright demeanour bears ever more poise than all disguised shows of good can do.

Lord Mountjoy, the deputy, was still surrounded by diffi culties. He had to hold out, not only against the native Irish, led by O'Neill, but against a force of four thousand Spaniards, who had effected a landing at Kinsale, under Don Juan D'Aguilar. To these dan gers threatening England from without, was added the deep discontent of the people at home ; who were groaning under that monstrous and oppressive system of monopolies, which had raised the prices of all the necessaries of life to an exorbitant amount. By a monopoly we are to understand a royal patent, which conveyed to some individual the right of exclusively selling any particular commodity ; and the power of granting such, the queen claimed, and justly, as a part of her royal prerogative. But she had now carried the practice to a grinding and ruinous extent. The patentee, if he did not exercise the privilege himself, disposed of it to another ; and, in either case, all in ferior venders, whether in wholesale or retail, were compelled to pay him a high yearly premium, which, Copy of her Majesty's letter to the King of Scots, written with her own hand.

This abuse had gone on increasing since the seventeenth year of the queen's reign ; who had found it a convenient way of paying a debt, or satisfying an importunate courtier or creditor, without drawing upon her own privy purse, or risking her popularity by direct taxa tion.1 It was to the deep and general discontent occasioned by this, that King James had alluded in his secret instructions to Mar and Kinloss, when he advised them to discover whether the impatience and disgust of the country had increased to such a height that they were unwilling to keep on terms any longer with prince or state ; in wdiich case, he observed, it would be a pity not to declare himself openly iu their favour, or to suffer them to be overthrown for lack of good backing : 2 a sentence, by the way, which proves that Elizabeth had good ground for her jealousy of the intrigues of the Scottish king with her subjects. But on the arrival of Mar and Kinloss, they soon discovered that the execrations of the people were directed rather against the minister Cecil and the government, than against the queen herself; and when parliament met, and the subject of the Irish war was brought before the Commons, it was soon seen that they knew perfectly how to make this distinction. The safety of the country and the honour of the queen demanded that they should make every sacrifice to bring the Irish war to a speedy and successful ter mination ; and for this purpose they agreed to one of the largest grants that had been given during this long reign ; voting at once four subsidies, and eight tenths and fifteenths, for the expense of the war : 3 but on the odious grievance of monopolies they were 1 Lingard's History of England, vol. viii. p. 380. 3 Hailes' Secret correspondence, pp. 2, 3. 3 Ibid. p. 25,"], [465, "1601-2.

It was time, therefore, to take the alarm ; and the queen, who, however obstinate with her ministers, never struggled beyond the proper point with her people, sent for the speaker of the Commons, and declared her resolution to abolish the whole system.1 This announcement was received with the utmost joy; the queen regained her popularity ; and soon after this, the total defeat of Tyrone and his Spanish auxiliaries, the successful termination of the war in Ireland, and the destruction of the Spanish galleys under Spinola, by a combined squadron of the English and Dutch, shed a farewell ray of glory over the last year of her reign. It was now no longer necessary for Elizabeth to court the assistance of James, or to keep in pay the hardy mercenaries of the Scottish Isles : her king dom was at peace ; and resuming her progresses and her gaieties, she struggled to overcome or defy her increasing infirmities ; rode to the chase ; had coun try dances in the privy chamber; selected a new favourite, in the young Earl of Clanricarde ; and seemed wholly given up to disport, at a time when it was apparent to every one that her hours had been far better spent in retirement from the world, and preparation for that last scene, which the greatest prince, as well as the meanest subject, must act alone.2 There had been some expectation in Scotland that the question of the succession was to have been agitated in the late parliament ; and the arrival of James's favourite, the Duke of Lennox, at the court 1 Lingard, vol. viii. pp. 380, 381 . 2 Lord Henry Howard to the Earl of Mar, Sept. 1602, Hailes' Cecil Correspondence, pp. 231, 233."], [466, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1602. 460 of England, at the moment of its being assembled, seems to have excited the suspicions of the queen ; x but this nobleman, although certainly sent by the King of Scots, chiefly to watch over his interests and confirm those secret friendships with which he was strengthening himself, acted with much prudence, paid his court effectually to the English queen, and lulled all resentment by his frank offer to lead the Scottish auxiliaries against the Spaniards and the Irish. New and alarming reports of the continued preparations of Philip the Third having recently reached the queen, she was particularly gratified by the secret informa tion which James had transmitted her on the subject, and by the readiness with which he had permitted Lennox to volunteer his services. These, however, she declined ; declaring that she would never consent to hazard so valuable a life in so perilous an enterprise, and dismissing him with the most flattering marks of her approbation.2 During the duke's residence in England, his chief care seems to have been to conciliate that party in the state which was opposed to Cecil, and whom this crafty minister represented as inimical to James. It was led by the Earl of Northumberland, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lord Cobham. Lord Henry Howard, the agent of Cecil, in his secret correspondence with the King of Scots, laboured to persuade that monarch that this faction were little to be trusted, without weight in the country, and altogether desperate, false, and reckless men. The great object of Cecil and Howard was to exalt their own power and services, 1 Lord Henry Howard to the Earl of Mar, 22d Nov. 1601, Hailes' Correspondence of Sir R. Cecil, p. 16. 2 MS.

To the king himself, Lord Henry's flattery almost borders upon blas phemy.1 On all others, except Cecil and his con fidants, he pours out an unceasing flood of abuse, slander, bitterness, and contempt ; and to that great princess whom they had idolized in her palmy days, and whose sun was now sinking in sorrow, there is not given a single sigh of regret, not a solitary glance of sympathy. It has been attempted to defend Cecil from being participant in these intrigues, by asserting that the correspondence is not his, and that he is not responsible for the letters of Lord Henry Howard ; but the argument will not bear examination. It is true, indeed, that he neither signed or indited the letters ; but he dictated them : he read and ap proved of them ; he despatched them ; he was present when the answers were received ; he opened the packet which contained them ; and King James, when he replies, either in his own person or through Mr. Bruce, his late ambassador, addresses Howard as the mere organ of Cecil. To have written in his own person, or to have given Lord Henry Howard any unlimited commission which should have made Cecil responsible for every sentiment uttered by this prince of flatterers, would have been far too bungling and dangerous an 1 He is the apple of the Eternal eye ; the most \" inestimable King James, whom neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, shall separate from the affection and vows they have, next to the sovereign possessor, vowed to him ; the redoubted monarch, of whose matchless mind Lord Henry thinks, as God's lieutenant on earth, with the same reverence and awe which he owes to God himself when he is on his knees.\" \u2014 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir Robert Cecil, pp. 154, 168, 170, 194, 233."], [468, "1602. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 462 expedient for so profound a politician, so accomplished a lover of mystery and intelligence, as this statesman. But every letter in the correspondence shows that a finer system was adopted, which insured safety to the minister in the event of detection, and yet interfered with none of the advantages of success ; by which Howard, although fully instructed beforehand by Cecil, expressed himself as if he acted alone, and at his own risk. It has been said, also, that the real letters of Cecil to James are preserved at Hatfield, amongst the archives of his noble descendant, and contain nothing discreditable to the secretary. But these, probably, were letters of mere ceremony and general good will, which Cecil despatched by the common opportunities, and cared not who should intercept or read : nay, it is quite possible that, in the intricate spirit of the diplomacy of these times, they wrere written to be intercepted, and for the purpose of lulling suspicion by the innocence of their contents. At all events, nothing could be more secretly or adroitly managed than the whole corres pondence between Howard, Cecil, and the Scottish king. No one had the least suspicion of the secret understanding that existed between the trio. In England, the secretary appeared wholly engrossed with public affairs, and so exclusively devoted to his royal mistress, that many wondered at his indifference to James, whilst he was in truth his sole adviser. When the subject of the succession was openly canvassed ; when all were looking to Scotland, and Cecil seemed to stand aloof, and, if the subject were forced upon him, spoke of the King of Scots with a coldness and indifference which blinded the most acute : James, on the other hand, acted his part with admirable dexterity ; praised Cecil for his fidelitv to"], [469, "1601-2. JAMES VI. 463 his royal mistress ; and affected great doubt whether he would eventually turn out his friend or his oppo nent. On one point, however, Sir Robert and Lord Henry mistook the character of their royal correspondent. To enhance their own services and destroy their rivals, they insisted on the absolute necessity of the king following out the precise plan which they had sketched out for him, and declining all offers of assistance but what came through themselves. North umberland, Raleigh, Shrewsbury, Cobham, were, ac cording to their representations, utterly unworthy of credit ; and were secretly engaged in courses which proved them to be bitterly opposed to his claim. To write to them, or to encourage any persons whatever who were not pointed out by his worthy and faithful Cecil, would, according to Lord Henry's opinion, be the extremity of folly, and might in a moment over throw all the fair fabric of their hopes. Nay, they had the boldness to proceed farther ; and not only attempted to work on the fears and suspicions of the Scottish king, by warning him of his enemies in England, but threw out dark and mysterious hints of treasonable intrigues in his own court, and even presumed to tutor him as to his conduct to his queen. Anne of Denmark, they hinted, was a worthy princess, yet a woman, and easily deceived by flatterers, who, for their own ends, were doing all they could to thwart the only measures which could guide him, under the pilotage of his worthy Cecil, to the haven where he would be. James, however, was not to be so cozened. He detected the selfishness of such conduct ; called upon them, if they really knew of any plots against his life or his rights, to speak out with the manly openness of truth, and have done with"], [470, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1601-2. 464 dark innuendoes. Following his own judgment, he treated with contempt their prohibition as to \" secret correspondents;\" wrote to Northumberland, accepting with warmth and gratitude his offers of service ; welcomed with courtesy and good will all who made advances to him; and took care that Lord Henry Howard should know that he considered the language used regarding his queen as a personal insult to him self. The two cunning statesmen, who had outwitted themselves in their desire to monopolize power and destroy their competitors, were astounded ; and Lord Henry's apology to his inestimable King James, was as abject as his object had been meau and selfish. James's greatest difficulty was with the Catholics, a powerful party in England ; yet regarded by the queen, and the Protestant body of her subjects, with so much suspicion, that it was almost equally danger ous to his hopes to conciliate, or to practise severity. But, happily for this prince, they were at this moment weakened by divisions ; and the great question of the \" succession,\" which had been keenly debated amongst the English Catholic exiles abroad, had eventually split them into two parties : the Spanish faction, led by the celebrated Father Persons, the author of the famous Treatise on the Succession, published under the ficti tious name of Doleman ; and their opponent faction, led by Paget. The first party had espoused the cause of the Infanta. It was to support her claim, as de scended from John of Gaunt, son of Edward the Third, that the book on the succession had been written : and as long as this princess continued single, and there was a chance of her marrying the King of Scots, or some English nobleman, it was thought not impossible that the English people might be reconciled to her acces sion. Her marriage, however, with the Archduke"], [471, "1601-2. JAMES VI. 465 Albert, rendered the prospect desperate ; and Persons, her champion, who had now deserted the court of Spain, and removed to Rome, abandoned her cause, and confined his efforts, and those of his party, to the succession of a Catholic prince.1 Who this should be, he declared, was a matter to him of indifference ; but many of his supporters in England looked to Arabella Stewart, the cousin-german of James ; and had formed a visionary project for her conversion to Rome, and her marriage with the Cardinal Farnese, also a de scendant of John of Gaunt.2 It was, perhaps, to this wild scheme that the Scottish king alluded, when he lamented that Arabella had been lately moved, by the persuasion of Jesuits, to change her religion :3 but there is no evidence that Persons, who had much in fluence with his party in England, ever believed it practicable ; and the publication of James's \"Basilicou Doron,\" appears to have given a new turn to the ideas of this devoted Catholic, and to have persuaded him, that a prince who could express himself with so much catholicity on some points, would, in time, \" suffer him self to be guided to the truth on all.\" There is a remarkable letter still preserved, in which Persons, writing from Rome, describes his having read some passages of the \" Basilicon\" to the pope, who, he says, could scarcely refrain from shedding tears of joy, in hearing them. \" May Christ Jesus,\" exclaimed Per sons, \" make him a Catholic ! for he would be a mirror to all princes of Christendom.\"4 All this rendered the Spanish faction far less bitter 1 Lingard's History of England, vol. viii. fourth edition, p. 388.

To him, therefore, they professed their readiness, on the death of Elizabeth, to transfer their allegiance : from him they looked, in return, for some alleviation of their sufferings, some toleration of their religion. And so keen were their feelings against the Spanish faction, that at the time Persons advocated the cause of the Infanta, he and his supporters met with no more de termined enemies than the English Catholic exiles.1 So far did they carry this hostility, that they entered into a secret correspondence with their own govern ment, and lowered themselves by becoming spies and informers against their brethren. 2 It was the anxious desire of the King of Scots to conciliate both these parties. One great argument in Persons' \" Conference on the Succession,\" which con tended that heresy must be considered an insurmount able ground of exclusion, was evidently directed against him ; and had formerly given rise to a mission of Pourie Ogilvy, a Catholic baron, whom he sent, in 1595, into Italy and Spain. At Venice, and at Rome, this envoy, acting, as he asserted, by the secret in structions of the King of Scots, represented his royal master as ready to be instructed in the Catholic faith, and to give a favourable and candid hearing to its ex pounders. On proceeding into Spain, Ogilvy's flight was bolder, and the promises held out more tempting and decided. The King of Scots, he said, was deter- ' Lingard's History of England, vol. viii. fourth edition, pp. 390, 391. 2 Ibid. rr"], [473, "1602. JAMES VI. 467 mined to revenge the injuries and insults offered him by the Queen of England, and eagerly desired the co-operation of Philip. Why then should their ma jesties not enter into a treaty ? His master, for his part, would become Catholic, establish the true faith in his dominions, and send his son, as a hostage for his sincerity, to be educated at the court of Spain. In return, he required from Philip a renunciation of his claims upon the English crown, an advance of 500,000 ducats, and an auxiliary force of 12,000 men. Philip, however, looked with suspicion on the ambassador, who had been observed to haunt with Paget and his friends in the Low Countries. His veracity, his cre dentials, even his religion, were disputed; and although treated with outward courtesy by the Spanish mon arch, he received little encouragement. But James, who had a strong predilection for these mysterious missions, was not cast down ; and returned to the attack. In September 1596, a second envoy, named Drummond, who alleged that he was employed by James, repaired to the papal court, and carried with him a letter from the king to Clement the Eighth, in which he suggested that the residence of a Scottish minister at the court of Rome would have the best effects ; and proposed that Drummond bishop of Vaison, a Scotsman by birth, should be selected for that purpose. The ambassador proposed also, in the king's name, that the young Prince Henry, his eldest son, should be brought up in the Catholic faith, and offered to place his castle of Edinburgh in the hands of the Catholics.1 It is extremely difficult to discover how much, or how little truth there was in these alleged intrigues of the Scottish king. Ogilvy, 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir R. Cecil, pp. 157, 158."], [474, "1602. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 468 undoubtedly, acted not only as an envoy of James, but a spy of Cecil ; and James, when challenged by Elizabeth's ambassador, Sir Henry Brunker, as to his letter to Clement, declared, in the most pointed and solemn manner, that he never wrote, or transmitted, such a document to Rome. The letter, however, was subsequently produced, and published by Cardinal Bellarmine. It undoubtedly bore the king's signa ture ; and, after a rigid inquiry, Lord Balmerino, the Scottish secretary of State, a Catholic, and near rela tive of the Bishop of Vaison, confessed that he had smuggled in the obnoxious epistle amongst a crowd of other papers ; and that the king, believing it to be a matter of form, like the rest, had signed it without glancing at its contents. This story, however, did not itself obtain belief. It was alleged that Balmerino had consented to become the scape-goat, that he might shelter his royal master; and the leniency of his punishment, for so daring an act, confirmed the suspi cion. But, on whatever side the truth may be, this secret intercourse produced a favourable feeling in the great body of the Catholics towards the King of Scots. The impression in his favour was universal amongst all parties in England ; and Howard assured the Earl of Mar, in a letter written in the summer of 1602, that all men spoke as freely and certainly of the suc cession of the King of Scots, as if they were about to take the oath of allegiance to him in his own capital.1 It remained only for James to take heed that no storms or commotions at home should disturb this fair weather in England. And here, too, his happy star prevailed ; and his efforts to extinguish those dreadful dissensions amongst his nobility, which, for 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir Robert Cecil, p. 127."], [475, "1602. JAMES VI. 469 many years, had exposed the country to all the horrors of private war, were at last successful. The Earls of Argyle and Huntley were reconciled, and their friend ship cemented by the betrothment of Argyle's daughter to Huntley's son.1 The Duke of Lennox, and the party of the Scottish queen, were induced to forget their deadly differences with the Earl of Mar ; and, last of all, that obstinate and far-ramifying blood-feud between the great houses of Moray and Huntley, which had now, for more than forty years, torn and depopulated some of the fairest portions of the coun try, was brought to an end by the firm and judicious arbitration of James. This success, and the extra ordinary calm with which it was accompanied, occa sioned the utmost joy throughout the country ; and Nicolson, the English resident, informed Cecil that nothing was now heard at court but the voice of festivity and gratulation ; the nobility feasting each other, consorting like brethren, and all united in one loving bond for the surety and service of the king.2 Amid these happy reconcilements, the King of Spain intimated to James his desire to send him an ambassador ; and Drummond bishop of Vaison soli cited permission to visit his native country. The King of France, also, in great secrecy, proposed a new league with Scotland, with the object of strengthening himself against Spain ; but as Henry added nothing as to including England, the Scottish king seized the opportunity to convince Elizabeth of his fair dealing. He accordingly despatched Roger Ashton with a full account of all his foreign negotiations; made her participant of his secret intelligence from Spain ; communicated the private offers of Henry the Fourth ; 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Nicolson to Cecil, 1st February, 1602. * Ibid."], [476, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1602. 470 and, expressing his deep gratitude for her steady friendship, requested her advice regarding the answers he should send to France and Spain.1 The queen, in reply, cautioned him against putting implicit trust in the promises of the French king, whose sincerity she doubted. \" Let others promise,\" said she, \" and I will do as much with truth as others with wiles.\" However, it would do little harm, she observed, to put Heury to the test ; and for her part she would make one of any league that was proposed. As to secrecy and taciturnity, he might thoroughly depend upon her ; her head might fail, but her tongue never.2 It was on this proposal of Philip, which came some what suspiciously about the same time as the Bishop of Vaison's offered visit, that Elizabeth addressed, in the beginning of January 1602-3, her last confidential letter to James. It was written entirely with her own hand, now so tremulous from age as to make the characters almost illegible ; but there was nothing of weakness or irresolution in the sentiments. It is here given entire, dated the 5th January, 1603, eleven weeks before her death ; which makes it pro bable that it was amongst the last letters of impor tance she ever wrote : \u2014 \" My very good Brother, \u2014 It pleaseth me not a little that my true intents, without glosses or guiles, are by you so gratefully taken ; for I am nothing of the vile disposition of such as, while their neighbours' houses is, or likely to he, a-fire, will not only not help, but not afford them water to quench the same.

For where hath there been an example that any one king hath ever denied so fair a present, as the whole seventeen provinces of the Low Countries ? yea, who not only would not have denied them, but sent a dozen gentlemen to warn him of their sliding from him, with offer of keeping them from the near neighbours' hands, and sent treasure to stay the shak ing towns from lapse. \u2014 Deserved I such a recompense as many a complot both for my life and kingdom?

JAMES VI. 473 Only ten days after her last letter, Elizabeth caught a severe cold at Whitehall ; and as she had been warned by Dr. Dee, her astrologer, to beware of that palace, she exposed herself to a removal to Richmond in stormy weather, and after a slight amendment became worse. Up to this time she had struggled sternly and strongly against every symptom of in creasing weakness. It had long been evident to all about her, that, since the death of Essex, her mind and constitution had been perceptibly shattered. Her temper was entirely broken ; and, in spite of every effort to defy it, a deep melancholy, and weariness of life, had fixed upon her. But although this was ap parent to near observers,1 to the world she kept up appearances ; and continued her usual fetes and diver sions, interrupted by sudden fits of silence, abstraction, and tears.2 At last the effort was too much; the bow, bent to its utmost endurance, snapt asunder ; and her lion heart, and strong energetic frame, sunk at once into a state of the most pitiable and helpless weakness. Every effort to rouse her was ineffectual. She would take neither medicines nor nourishment ; her sleep entirely forsook her, and a low hectic fever seemed to be wasting her by inches ; whilst she com plained of a heavy load upon the heart, which made her sigh almost incessantly, and seek, in vain, for relief in a restless change of position. These sad symptoms increased to such a degree in the beginning of March, that the physicians pronounced her case hopeless; and it was deemed right to send for the council, who arrived at Richmond on the 18th of 1 Letter of Sir John Harrington, quoted in Dr. Lingard's History, vol. viii. p. 394. _* . ... .

With this object, it was resolved, that the lord high-admiral, Howard earl of Nottingham, the only member of the council whose presence seemed to give comfort to the dying queen, Cecil, the secretary of state, and the lord keeper, should remain at Richmond ; whilst the rest of the council repaired to Whitehall. Orders, at the same time, were issued to set a guard upon the Exchequer; to arrest and transport to Holland all suspicious characters found lurking in London and Westminster; to furnish the court with means of defence ; and convey to the Tower some gentlemen who were believed to be desperate from discontent, and anxious for innovation. Most of these whose hands it was thus thought wise to manacle, before they could use them in any sudden mischief, were partisans of Essex ; and it is remarkable, that in this number we find Baynham, Catesby, and Tresham, afterwards involved in the Gunpowder Treason. Whilst these precautions were being taken, the melancholy object of them, the queen, seemed retired and sunk within herself; took no interest in any thing that was going on ; and if roused for a moment, declared that she felt no pain, required no remedies, and was anxious for death. She expressed, however, a strong desire to hear prayers in her private chapel, and all was made ready ; but she found the effort too much for her, and had cushions spread at the door of the privy chamber, where she lay and heard service. Want of food and sleep appear, not long after, to have brought on a partial delirium ; for she now obsti nately insisted on sitting up, dressed, day and night, upon her cushions ; and when entreated by the lord"], [481, "JAMES VI. 1603. 475 admiral to go to bed, assured him, with a shudder of terror, that if he had seen what she saw there, he w-ould choose any place but that. She then motioned him to approach her ; and ordering the rest to leave the room, drew him with a piteous gesture down to her low seat, and exclaimed, \" My lord, they have bound me : I am tied with an iron collar about my neck.\"1 It was in vain he attempted either argument or consolation : no power would make her undress or go to bed ; and in this miserable state she sat for two days and three nights, her finger pressed upon her lips, as if afraid of betraying some secret ; her eyes open and fixed on the ground, and generally silent and immoveable.2 Yet, when Cecil her secretary re monstrated against this, and asked if she had seen spirits, she smiled contemptuously, and said the ques tion was not worthy an answer ; but when he told her she must go to bed, if it were but to satisfy her people, she showed a flash of her former spirit. \" Must !\" said she; \" is must a word to be addressed to princes? Ah, little man, little man! thy father, had he been alive, durst not have used that word ; but thou art presumptuous, because thou knowest I shall die.\" To the same minister she repeatedly de clared that she was not mad, and that he must not think to make Queen Joan of her : alluding, perhaps, to Joanna the deranged Queen of Naples.3 It was now thought right to summon the ministers of religion ; upon which the aged Whitgift archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of London her almoner, immediately repaired to Richmond ; and being ad- 1 Lingard, vol. viii. p. 397.

They attempted to induce her to take some nourishment, and to follow the prescriptions of her physicians ; but this she steadily refused, declaring that she had no wish to live. They then exhorted her to provide for her spiritual safety : to which she mildly answered, \" That I have done long ago.\"1 When the archbishop, who was affected by the deep despondency and melancholy into which she had sunk, attempted to rouse and comfort her by alluding to the services she had conferred on Europe, and by her glorious defence of the Protestant faith, she checked him severely, declaring that she had too long listened to the voice of flattery, and that it should at least be silent on her death-bed ; but she held him by the hand, and compelled him to continue his prayers, till the aged primate's knees were wearied, and he had almost sunk down at her bedside. At last she permitted him to depart, after receiving his blessing. In these devotions she did not join audibly, for her speech had almost entirely left her for two days before her death ; but it was apparent to those around her that she was per fectly sensible ; and they had the comfort of seeing her lift her eyes to heaven, and join her trembling, emaciated hands in the attitude of prayer.2 To the latest moment of her life she seemed willing to keep up the mystery as to her successor, and either evaded the question, or replied so obscurely, that it was difficult to divine her wishes.

Her answer was proud and brief: \" My seat has been the seat of kings, and none but a king must succeed me.\" They urged her to be more explicit, and mentioned the King of France ; but she was silent. They then ventured on the King of Scots ; but she vouchsafed no sign. The Lord Beauchamp, the heir of the house of Suffolk by his mother Lady Catherine Grey, was then spoken of; upon which she roused herself and said, with a look and flash of her former lion spirit, \" I will have no rascal's son in my seat.\" J Here, according to the account of Lady Southwell, one of her maids of honour, who stood at the moment beside the bed, the important interview ended ; and the queen never again spoke. But, on the other hand, it was posi tively affirmed by Cecil, and the two lords his companions, that at a later hour of the same night she clearly declared by signs that the King of Scots alone ought to succeed her. When his name was mentioned, it is said she suddenly started, heaved herself up in the bed, and held her hands jointly over her head in manner of a crown. It is probable that this sign, given by the dying princess, was one of asseut ; yet, it is possible, also, that they who had seized the awful moment when her soul was hovering between the two worlds to torture her with questions, may have mistaken a movement of agony for one of approbation.2 Soon after this she sunk into a state of insensibility, and about midnight fell into a placid sleep, from which she woke to expire gently and without a struggle. 1 MS. by Lady Southwell, Lingard, vol. viii. p. 397. 2 Sloan MSS. printed by Ellis, second series, vol. iii. p. 194."], [484, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 478 1603. Cecil and the lords at Richmond, instantly posted to London ; at six in the morning the council assembled ; and on that same morning, before ten o'clock, King James the Sixth was proclaimed heir and successor to Elizabeth, both by proximity of blood, and, as it was now positively added, by her own appointment upon her death-bed. Sir Robert Carey, Lord Hunsdon's youngest son, a near relative and favourite of the queen, wa<? ax Richmond during her few last miserable days of suffering; and Lady Scrope, his sister, one of her ladies, watched her royal mistress at the moment of her death. Both were friends and correspondents of the King of Scots, and it had been concerted between the brother and sister that the distinction of being the first to announce the happy news to that monarch should be theirs. It was difficult, however, to cheat the vigilancy of Cecil and the council, who had ordered all the gates of the palace to be closed ; but Carey was on the alert, ready booted and spurred ; his sister stood beside the bed, watching for her mis tress' last sigh ; and the moment it was breathed, she snatched a ring from her finger, (it had been a gift from the King of Scots,) glided out of the chamber, and cast it over the palace window to her brother, who threw himself on horseback, and rode post into Scotland. The queen had died at three o'clock on Thursday morning, and Carey reached the palace of Holyrood on Saturday night, after the royal expectant had retired to bed. He was immediately admitted; and throwing himself on his knees, saluted James as monarch of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. The king asked for the token ; and Carey, drawing the ring from his bosom, presented it in his sister's name. James then gave him his hand to kiss ; and without evincing any unseemly exultation, bade the"], [485, "1603. JAMES VI. 479 messenger good night, and composed himself to rest. Next morning, and for the two succeeding days, the news was not made public, as Carey's message was not official ; but on the third day, Sir Charles Percy, brother to the Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas Somerset, son of Lord Worcester, arrived with a letter from the privy council of England, announcing the death of the queen, the proclamation of James's accession to the throne, and the universal joy and impatience with which the people of England expected their new monarch. It assured him that their sorrow for their recent loss was extinguished by looking forward to the heroical virtues which resided in his person, laid at his feet the humble offering of their faith and obedience, and besought him, in his excel lent wisdom, to visit them with all speed, that he might take possession of his inheritance, and inspire new life into its languishing body.1 This great event was now communicated to the people, who received it at first with universal demon strations of exultation and delight ; and the king declared his determination to set out speedily for his new kingdom, leaving the queen and his children to follow at a slower pace. He committed the govern ment of Scotland to the privy-council ; intrusted his eldest son, Henry, now Prince of Wales, to the Earl of Mar ; Prince Charles to Sir Alexander Seton president of the Session ; and the Princess Elizabeth to the Earl of Linlithgow. On the succeeding Sunday, James attended service in the High Church of St. Giles, where a sermon was preached, in which the minister enumerated the many mercies poured out upon their prince ; and described, as none of 1 Spottiswood, pp. 473, 474."], [486, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1603. 480 the least, his peaceable accession to that mighty kingdom which now awaited him. The monarch himself then rose and delivered a valedictory address to the congregation, which, we are told, was often interrupted by the tears of the people. James, who was himself moved by these expressions of regret and affection, entreated his subjects not to be too deeply troubled at his departure ; assured them that they should find the fruits of his government as well afar off as when he had resided amongst them ; pleaded that his increase in greatness did in nowise diminish his love ; aud promised them a personal visit once every three years ; when the meanest as well as the greatest, should have access to his person, and permis sion to pour their complaints into his bosom.1 This farewell oration was delivered on the 3d of April, 1603. On the 5th of the same month the king, surrounded by a large and brilliant cavalcade, composed not only of Scottish but of English noble men and gentlemen, who had hurried to his court with the proffers of their homage, took his departure from Edinburgh amid the lamentations of the citizens. His progress through England, which occupied a month, was one long and brilliant pageant. Triumphs, speeches, masques, huntings, revels, gifts, all that wealth could command, and flattery and fancy devise, awaited him at the different cities and castles which he visited; and on the 6th of May, 1603, he entered London, accompanied by a numerous concourse of his nobility and councillors, guarded and ushered by the Lord Mayor and five hundred citizens on horseback, and welcomed by the deafening shouts of an immense multitude of his new subjects. It seemed as if the 1 Calderwood, p. 472. Spottiswood, p. 476."], [487, "1603. JAMES VI. 481 English people had in this brief period utterly for gotten the mighty princess, whose reign had been so glorious, and over whose bier they had so lately sorrowed. Not a murmur was heard, not one dis senting voice was raised to break the unanimity of his welcome ; and thus, after so many centuries of war and disaster, the proud sceptre of the Tudors was transferred to the house of Stewart, with a tranquillity and universal contentment, which, even considering the justice of the title, was remarkable and unexpected. In this memorable consummation, it was perhaps not unallowable, certainly it was not unnatural, that the lesser kingdom, which now gave a monarch to the greater, should feel some emotions of national pride : for Scotland had defended her liberty against innumer able assaults; had been reduced, in the long struggle, to the very verge of despair; had been betrayed by more than one of her kings, and by multitudes of her nobles ; had been weakened by internal faction, dis tracted by fanatic rage ; but had never been overcome, because never deserted by a brave, though rude and simple people. Looking back to her still remoter annals, it could be said, with perfect historical truth, that this small kingdom had successfully resisted the Roman arms, and the terrible invasions of the Danish sea kings ; had maintained her freedom, within her mountains, during the ages of the Saxon Heptarchy, and stemmed the tide of Norman conquest ; had shaken off the chains a/tempted to be fixed upon her by the two great Plantagenets, the First and Third Edwards, and, at a later period, by the tyranny of the Tudors ; and if now destined, in the legitimate course of royal succession, to lose her station as a separate VOL.

Yet, however pleased at this pacific termination of their long struggles, the feelings with which his ancient people beheld the departure of their prince were of a melancholy nature ; and an event occurred on the same day on which he set out, that made a deep impression upon a nation naturally thoughtful and superstitious. As the monarch passed the house of Seton, near Musselburgh, he was met by the funeral of Lord Seton, a nobleman of high rank ; which, with its solemn movement and sable trappings, occupied the road, and contrasted strangely and gloomily with the brilliant pageantry of the royal cavalcade. The Setons were one of the oldest and proudest families of Scot land ; and that lord whose mortal remains now passed by had been a faithful adherent of the king's mother, whose banner he had never deserted, and in whose cause he had suffered exile and proscription. The meeting was thought ominous by the people. It appeared, to their excited imaginations, as if the moment had arrived when the aristocracy of Scotland was about to merge in that of Great Britain ; as if the Scottish nobles had finished their career of national glory, and this last representative of their race had been arrested on his road to the grave, to bid fare well to the last of Scotland's kings.

No. I. Historical Remarks on the Queen of Scots' supposed Accession to Babington's Conspiracy. That Mary was a party to this plot, so far as it involved a project for her escape, may be assumed as certain ; indeed, she appears to have admitted it, by implication at least, on her trial. But the question remains, and it is one deeply affecting Elizabeth and her ministers \u2014 was she cognizant of the resolution to assassinate the English queen? \u2014 did she permit, or encourage this atrocious design? After a careful research into the history of this conspiracy, and an anxious desire to procure and weigh every document connected with it, I believe Mary's solemn assertion to be true, \u2014 that she neither gave any encouragement to the plot, nor was aware of its existence. Hume, who pronounces Mary guilty, has written on this conspiracy with all his inimitable clearness and plausibility ; but unfortunately with much of his usual carelessness as to facts and dates, which enter deeply into the question, and which a little trouble might have enabled him to discover and to rectify. Dr. Lingard, in an acute note added to the last edition of his History,1 has supported Mary's innocence ; and Dr. Robertson, without interrupting his narrative by critical remarks, has assumed it. Referring the reader to the works of these eminent men, I shall now briefly give some additional facts and observations, from which there arises the strongest presumption, if not absolute proof, of the innocence of the Queen of Scots. First. It is evident, from the history of this conspiracy as given in the text, that Phelipps the decipherer had much, almost every thing, in his power as to the proof of Mary's guilt or innocence. Ha 1 Note M. vol. viii. History of England, p. 434."], [494, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 488 was admitted by Walsingham into all \" the secrets of the cause,\" (to use Paulet's phrase ;) he enjoyed the full confidence of this minister and his royal mistress. It does not appear that any other person about Walsingham or the Queen of England could decipher. There are letters in the State-paper Office, and in the British Museum, which prove that whenever any intercepted letters in cipher fell into the hands of Elizabeth or Secretary Walsingham, they were forth with sent to Phelipps \" to be made English ;\" * and it is certain that he did decipher, and retain in his hands for ten days, the letter in cipher from Mary to Babington, upon a copy of which that princess was convicted. It is evident from all this, that Phelipps had the power and the opportunity to alter the letters of Babington or of Mary which were sent him to be deciphered ; and owing to the ignorance of his employers in this intricate science, he might have done so without much, or almost any fear of discovery. But it may be asked, Could he be so base as to garble these letters? or was Walsingham so lost to all sense of justice and honour as to have permitted it? To this I reply, that there is preserved in the State-paper Office a letter or petition of Phelipps to the Earl of Salisbury, an extract from which I give below, which proves, that in one noted instance he had availed himself of his talents and opportunity to a base and unscrupu lous extent. In this case he did not add to or alter any letter placed in his hands ; but he did much more. He composed, or created, an entirely imaginary correspondence. He wrote letters under the name of an imaginary person to a real person, who enjoyed the confidence of the Spanish government, and who, by the forgery of these letters, was betrayed into a correspondence with Phelipps, who made his own uses of his base contrivance. All this he acknowledges in a letter to 1 MS. letter, Caligula, C. ix. sol. 455. Davison to Phelipps, Dec. 11. Davison to Phelipps. \" Mr. Phelipps.

Such being the unscrupulous character of this person, is it any overstrained supposition, that such a man would have felt little hesi tation in altering the letters of the Queen of Scots, to suit the purposes of her enemies ? But here it is asked, (and the argument is insisted on by Hume,) \u2014 would a man of such high honour and probity as Walsingham have been guilty of so base a proceeding? As to this alleged probity and honour, Hume, it is evident, trusted to the common eulogies which, in popular works, have been bestowed on Elizabethan states men. Happily, however, the correspondence of Elizabeth's ministers remains to test this praise ; and Walsingham has left many letters which prove, incontestably, that, in working out any object which he was persuaded was for the good of the state, he was quite as crafty 1 State-paper Office, April 29, 1606. Thomas Phelipps, original, in his own hand, dated (in pencil) April 29, 1606 : \u2014 \" Phelipps humbly prayeth, that the king's majesty may be moved to descend into a gracious consideration of his case, and he doubteth not but his majesty shall find cause to conceive much better of his proceedings than it seemeth he doth. \" The truth is, that there never was any real or direct correspondence held with Owen. But, by a mere stratagem and sleight in the late queen's time, that state upon an occasion, was entertained in an opinion of an intelligence with an imaginary person on this side, such as was none in rerum naturd, which Owen, abused, did manage on that side, as Phelipps for the queen's service did on this. The manner whereof and the means were particularly declared to my Lord of Salisbury by Ph. when he was first called in question, who had himself made some use of it in the queen's time ; and you, Mr. Lieutenant can, best of any man, remember how the queen and my Lord of Essex served themselves of it. \" In the carriage of this business, the imaginary correspondent being pressed to find somebody that should set afoot certain overtures, touching peace and the jewels of the house of Burgundy, and such like, Phelipps was nominated and used for those purposes, to the contentment of both sides, as it fell out at sundry times, without that it was known, or so much as suspected, that Phelipps was the man that indeed managed all matters. \" With the queen's life this course was supposed to have been quite deter mined ; but shortly after, upon the hope of amity which was growing between this realm and Spain, an address was newly made to the imaginary corres pondent in Maucididor's name, to have Phelipps moved to concur with those that should be set a-work both for peace and league of firm amity between the princes, with large offers, and promises of honourable gratification to all such as could do any good therein. \" Which being a thing in itself not unlawful, and Phelipps seeing opportunity offered him to make himself thereby of use, he willingly embraced.\""], [496, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 490 and unscrupulous as his brethren. In those dark times, the scale of moral duty and honour was miserably low : justice, truth, religion, were names common in men's mouths, but slightly regarded in their actual dealings. To open letters, to rob an ambassador's desk, to corrupt his servants, to forge his signature, were all allowable methods of furthering the business of the state. The reader is already well aware of the little value placed on human life, of the frequency of private assassination, and the encouragement given to it by the highest statesmen of the age. To argue on the honour and probity of such men \u2014 as we should be entitled to do had they lived in our own times, (lax as this age may be in some things) \u2014 must lead to error. Nay, Hume himself was aware of, and states one instance in which Walsingham acted with a total disregard of all high principle. This historian tells us, that the English secretary, when he had in tercepted and opened Mary's letters to Babington, added to them a postscript in the same cipher, in which she desired him to inform her of the names of the conspirators ; hoping thus to elicit from Babing ton the whole secrets of the plot. Was it possible that any man of common probity could have so acted ? and what are we to think of his letter quoted in the text, in which, in obedience to the English queen's commands, he solicited Paulet to put Mary privately to death ? Could a man of the slightest probity have written that letter ? It appears, then, that Phelipps and Walsingham were persons capable of such a course as garbling and altering Mary's letters : it is evident that Phelipps had the power and the talent to do so ; and we have seen, from the history of the conspiracy given in the text, that both were anxious to convict her and bring her to punish ment. But it may be said, All this is presumption : where is the proof that they added any thing to these letters ? In answer to this may be first quoted, the forged postscript endorsed in Phelipps' handwriting, \" Postscript of the Scottish queen's letter to Babington,\" 1 inquiring the names of the six gentlemen. Hume, following Camden,2 asserts that Walsingham added a postscript of this import to one of Mary's letters to Babington. It is singular, however, that it should not have struck this historian, that no such postscript appeared in any of Mary's alleged letters produced at the trial ; and had this charge, which involves so grave a delinquency in Walsingham, rested on the single assertion of Camden, one would certainly have hesitated to believe it. But the case is altered by the discovery (mentioned in the text, p. 50) of this postscript in cipher, endorsed by Phelipps, 1 Supra, p. 50. a Hume, p. 453. Edition 1832. In one volume. Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 517."], [497, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 491 and preserved in the State-paper Office. Now, such a postscript was either what it purports to be \u2014 an original of Mary's, or a true copy of such an original, or a forgery. If it were an original of Mary's, or a true copy of such, why, it may be asked, was it not produced against her at the trial ? It connected her with the six conspirators, who were Babington's associates ; and in this light would have been decided evidence against her. But no use was made of it at the trial ; and it may be conjectured, from this suppression, that, after having exercised his skill in fabricating it, Phelipps changed his scheme for the conviction of the Scottish queen, and introduced the sentences connecting her with the six gentlemen who were to assassi nate the English queen into the body of the letters, rather than in a postscript at the end. In the next place, although there is no direct evidence by which we can detect Phelipps or Walsingham in the act of garbling and altering Mary's letters, yet strong presumptive evidence is furnished by the circumstances of the trial itself ; and this even after making allowance for the partiality and disregard of justice which appears in all the judicial proceedings of those times. It is evident that Mary could only be proved guilty by the produc tion of her own letters ; by the production of the minutes, or rough drafts of these in her own hand ; by the evidence of her secretaries, Nau and Curie, who wrote the letters ; or by the evidence of Phelipps, who deciphered them. The limits to which I must confine these remarks will not permit me to go into detail ; but it may be observed, that on each of these modes of proof, the evidence against the Scottish queen either totally fails, or is defective. 1 . No original of Babington's long letter to her, or of her answer to Babington, was produced. Mary anxiously demanded the produc tion of both, and positively asserted that she had never written the letter of which they produced a copy ; but she demanded it in vain, and she was convicted on the evidence of this avowed copy. 2. It was stated by Nau, her secretary, that the greater part of her letter to Babington was copied by him from a minute in Mary's own hand, written in French, which he stated, would be found amongst her papers,1 and which, if we are to believe Nau's declaration, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, September 7, 1586. Waad to Phelipps. \" Her majesty's pleasure is, you should presently repair hither ; for that, upon Nau's confession, it should appear we have not performed the search sufficiently ; for he doth assure we shall find, amongst the minutes which were in Pasquier's chests, the copies of the letters wanting, both in French and English.\""], [498, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 492 Elizabeth and her ministers had really in their hands, and could have produced if they pleased.1 Now these French minutes, written in Mary's hand, if they had contained the guilty passages connecting her with the plot against Elizabeth's life, would undoubtedly have proved the case against her. Why, then, were they not produced ? It seems plain, that if found at all, of which there is reason to doubt,2 they did not contain any mention of the plot against Elizabeth's life. Here, again, the proof against the Scottish queen totally fails. 3. As to Nau and Curie, the manner of dealing with these two secretaries of Mary betrays, in a striking way, the weakness of the proof against her. She anxiously requested to he allowed to examine them ; and engaged, if this were permitted, to prove by their testi mony, that she was innocent. This was denied : she was shown some depositions to which they had attached their signatures ; and other declarations were produced wholly written by them, the contents of which, it was argued, proved her guilty of sending the long letter to Babington. Mary's reply to these depositions has been already stated in the text : but it is here material to attend to an observation of Dr. Lingard, who contends, and apparently with perfect justice, that, judging from the only papers which now remain, it does not appear that Nau or Curie were ever shown the original of Mary's letter in cipher to Babington, or the true deciphered copy of it ; but merely an abstract of the principal points in it, so made up as to render it doubtful whether they included the guilty passages which Mary so solemnly affirmed were not dictated or written by her.3 It is true, indeed, that in the State-paper Office, and in the British Museum also, there are preserved copies of Mary's letter to Babington, with the copy of an attestation signed by Curie and Nau ; \u2014 but in what terms is it given? Do they verify, on oath, that this is a true copy 1 Orig.

But next day, September 4, Walsingham, in a letter to Phelipps, State-paper Office, says, \" the minute of her answer is not extant ;\" and on the 7th September these alleged minutes and letter of Mary's were still wanting ; for Waad writes to Phelipps to search anew for them. (State-paper Office, Waad to Phelipps, 7th September, 1586.) I have discovered no proof that they were ever found. 3 Lingard, History of England, vol. viii. pp. 220, 221 ; and Appendix, pp. 436, 437."], [499, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 493 of the letter written by them from Mary's dictation, and sent to Babington ? Far from it. Nau simply says, he truly thinks, to the best of his recollection, this is the letter ; and Curie, that it was either this letter, or one like it, that he put in cipher.1 And it was on such an attestation as this that Burghley contended that the Scottish queen was guilty ? 4. There was yet one other way in which the defects of the proof against Mary might have been supplied. If Walsingham and Burghley could not produce the original of her letter to Babington \u2014 if they had no minutes of this letter in her own handwriting \u2014 they still had Phelipps, who had deciphered it, and who could have attested on oath the accuracy of his own decipher, and its agreement with the copy produced at the trial. Why was this man not produced ? Can the motive be doubted ? There are three original papers preserved in the State-paper Office, which appear to me to establish Mary's innocence, on as convincing grounds as the question admits of. It has been already noticed, that when Nau affirmed that the greater part of Mary's letter to Babington was taken by him from an original in the queen's hand, and that this minute of her answer would be found in her repositories, a strict search was made, which was wholly unsuccessful ; and on the 4th September, Walsingham became convinced that \" the minute was not extant.\" This failure of obtaining proof against Mary, threw Wal singham into great perplexity, in the midst of which he wrote this letter to Phelipps : \u2014 Walsingham to Phelipps. \" This morning I received the enclosed from Francis Milles ; and this afternoon he made report unto me of his proceeding with Curie accordingly as is set down in the enclosed ; by the which you may perceive that Curie doth both testify the receipt of Babington's letters, as also the queen his mistress's answer to the same, wherein he chargeth Nau to have been a principal instrument. I took upon me to put him in comfort of favour, in case he would deal plainly ; being moved thereto for that the minute of her answer is not extant, and that I 1 \" Je pense de v'ray que c'est la lettre escripte par sa Majeste a Babington, eomme il me souvenit. \u2014 Ainsi signe. \" Nac.\" \" Telle ou semblable me semble avoir este la reponse escripte en Framjois par Monsr.

And so God keep you. From Barnelme, the 4th September, 1586.1 \"Fe. Walsingham.\" This letter proves that no minutes in Mary's handwriting, connect ing her with the letter to Babington, had then (4th September) been found ; that Nau had confessed nothing that implicated her ; and that all Walsingham's hopes rested on bribing Curie, by some \" extraor dinary favour,\" to make further disclosures. In these difficulties, it seems to have struck Phelipps, that Curie and Nau might be intimidated into confessing something against Mary, by showing them that they had already, by their written declarations, confessed enough against themselves to involve a charge of treason, as abettors of the plot for the invasion of England, and the escape of the Scottish queen. The idea of Phelipps was, to say to these secretaries of the Queen of Scots \u2014 \" We have already enough against you to hang you ; but be more explicit : tell us something which may connect your mistress with Babington's designs against Elizabeth's life, and you shall receive ' some extraordinary favour.' \" For this purpose Phelipps, on the 4th September, the very day on which Walsingham wrote the above letter, drew up some remarks, which he sent to Burghley, who has endorsed them \" From Phelipps.\" This paper is entitled, \" An Extract of the points contained in the minutes written by Nau and Curie, arguing their privity to the enter prise of the Catholics, and their mistress's plot,\" \u2014 1th September, 1586.

The plot related entirely, as is shown by these proofs, to the Spanish invasion of England, and the plans drawn up by Mary for her escape, to which she pleaded guilty. This defect appears to have struck Burghley, and Phelipps en deavoured to supply it by drawing up for this statesman a second Summary, endorsed by Burghley, \" From Phelipps,\" and dated on the same day as the former, 4th Sept. 1506.

In the same letter Curie taketh order that )-( shall stand for Babington's name. \" Litera A showeth that there was another letter in cipher sent to Babington by the secret messenger, 27th July, which Babington shall confess to be the bloody letter. The letters to Babington, and from Babington, two of them were very long, and all in cipher, fair written, (as Babington will confess ;) and therefore it cannot choose but that the queen's letter was put in cipher by Nau or Curie, and Babington's letter likewise deciphered. \" The new alphabet sent to be used in time to come between that queen and Babington, accompanying the bloody despatch, is of Nau's hand. \" The heads of that bloody letter sent to Babington, touching the design ment of the queen's person, [by this he means the plot to assassinate Elizabeth,] is of Nau's hand likewise. \" They cannot any way say it should stand with reason that the queen did decipher, and put in cipher, her letters herself : for it appeareth that she despatched ordinarily more pacquets every fort night than it was possible for one body well exercised therein to put in cipher, and decipher those sent ; much less for her, being diseased, a queen, &c. \" It appeareth all letters were addressed to one of them, Nau or Curie ; for that in the deciphering there is, for the most part, a post script found to them \u2014 excusing sometimes the error or length of the cipher, sometimes of their private occasions,\" &c. Such is this second \" Summary.\" Now it will be noted that Phe lipps argues thus. The letters of Mary to Mendoza, Lord Paget, and others, marked F, 0, K, D, E, L, were written from minutes drawn up by Curie and Nau from Mary's dictation. It is, therefore, to be presumed, that a similar trust would he given them for writing the letters to Babington. Is there not here an express admission by Phelipps, that there was no proof that Mary had given any instructions whatever to her secretaries, which connected her with the alleged letter to Babington produced on her trial. \u2014 He presumes that she 1 Barnaby is a name for Gilbert Gifford. \"Curie's Letter,\" 19th June ; State-paper Office, in which he saya \"/' stands also for Barnaby, or Gilbert Gifford.\" VOL. VII. 2 I"], [504, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 498 may have given instructions for Babington's letter, because she gave such instructions for the letters to Mendoza, Paget, and the rest. But there is a still more important fact stated by Phelipps in this second \" Summary.\" The heads of the bloody letter to Babington had, it appears, been found, although the minutes of this same letter, which Nau affirmed to have been given him by the queen in her own handwriting, had not been found. And these heads, let it be observed, were in the handwriting of Nau himself, not of Mary. It is, therefore, evident, that the utmost exertions, and the strictest search on the part of Mary's enemies, directed by all the skill and vigour of Walsingham, and carried into effect by the unscrupulous artifices and ingenuity of Phelipps, had not been able to find the smallest scrap of evidence under Mary's hand, which could connect her with the plot against Queen Elizabeth's life. Last of all, we have in this \"Summary,\" the admission that all the letters, (which includes Babington's among the rest,) were addressed not to Mary, but either to Nau or Curie \u2014 that Mary relied on Nau and Curie to decipher them \u2014 and that the queen's alleged letter to Babington was put in cipher either by Nau or Curie. If, then, (to sum up these proofs,) Babing ton's alleged letter was not addressed to Mary \u2014 if she had nothing to do with deciphering it \u2014 if the alleged answer in cipher was not made by her \u2014 if there were no minutes in her hand for that answer \u2014 if Nau and Curie's declarations do not connect her with the plot against the queen's life \u2014 and if Phelipps, whose evidence under such a lack of proof could alone have supplied the deficiency, was not brought forward \u2014 it appears difficult to resist the conclusion, that Mary was implicated solely in a plot for her escape, that she was entirely ignorant of the project for Elizabeth's assassination, and that she was the victim of forged letters manufactured by her enemies.1 It would be easy to corroborate this conclusion by some additional arguments, drawn from the successive declarations of Nau, and other letters or papers preserved in the British Museum and State-paper Office : but enough has been said upon the point ; and any reader who wishes to pursue the inquiry, will find ample materials in these two noble repositories of original information. He will there find the lists, notes, and arguments which Lord Burghley drew up previous to the trial of the Scottish queen \u2014 upon which I cannot enter ; but 1 In the British Museum, Caligula. C. ix. sol. 458, there is a confession of Thomas Harrison, who styles himself Secretary to Sir Francis Walsingham, in which he states that Walsingham, Phelipps, and himself, contrived the con spiracy, and forged the letters, for which Mary suffered death.

The following letter was entirely written in the queen's own hand, and sent to the king by the Duke of Lennox : \u2014 Elizabeth to James, 2d December, 1601, page 460. \" My dear Brother, \u2014 Never was there yet Prince nor meaner wight, to whose grateful turns I did not correspond, in keeping them in memory, to their avail and my own honour ; so trust I, that you will not doubt but that your last letters by Fovvles and the duke are so acceptably taken, as my thanks can not be lacking for the same, hut yields them you in thankful sort. And albeit I suppose I shall not need to trouble any of your subjects in my service, yet, according to your request, I shall use the liberty of your noble offer, if it shall be requisite. \" And whereas your faithful and dear duke hath at large discoursed with me, as of his own knowledge, what faithful affection you bear me, and hath added the leave he hath received from you, to proffer himself for the performer of my service in Ireland, with any such as best may please me under his charge, I think myself greatly in debted to you for your so tender care of my prosperity ; aud have told him that I would be loath to venture his person in so perilous service, since I see he is such one that you make so great a reckon ing of ; but that some of meaner quality, of whom there were less loss, might in that case he ventured. \" And sure, dear brother, in my judgment, for the short acquain tance that I have had with him, you do not prize with better cause any near unto you : for I protest, without feigning or doubling, I never gave ears to greater laud, than such as 1 have heard him pro nounce of you, with humble desire that I would banish from my mind anv evil opinion or doubt of your sincerity to me.
