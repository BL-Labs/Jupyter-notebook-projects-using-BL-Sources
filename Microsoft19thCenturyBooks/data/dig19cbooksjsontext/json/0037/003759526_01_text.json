THE WEAR. Silence and snow \u2014 inseparable friends \u2014 had laid a dainty coverlet over the old ca thedral city, and hushed its beating heart to repose. Snow on all things, gemming the boughs that shimmered in the moonshine ; blocking the country roads and stifling the sound of traffic in the streets ; fostering in the fields the seeds beneath its fleecy mantle ; clinging to window-frames like quaint old alabaster carvings ; and pressing to its own destruction on the roofs near to the warm chimney-stacks.

Silence was in the air and on the ground ; the silence of nature, its universal homage to the white-robed spirit \u2014 Snow. It was Christmas Eve, and, through the length and breadth of the land, preparations to celebrate the morrow duly were making a merry noise in thousands of homes. So, in the north, where hearts are warm as the fires which glow upon their hearths, be sure there was no stint of the good things pertaining to Christmas hospitality. The pitmen's wives, by their huge caverns of fire, with gowns tucked up, were as busy and bustling as the cooks and mistresses of pretentious mansions, and olfactory organs might scent afar off as savoury banquets in pit villages as in the most aristocratic streets of the city, not so"], [15, "THE WEAR. 3 artistic, perhaps, but more substantial and quite as satisfactory. Holly and mistletoe had passed from hedge to hand, and hung overhead, or decked the walls and windows alike of rich and poor ; preparations were completed, and friends as sembled, or passed from home to home to \" see Christmas in \" and punch-bowls out, until it became a not uncommon thing thence to emerge unable to see clearly either Christ mas or the way home. Shaped like a horse-shoe, the river Wear, now spanned by four bridges, girdles the city of Durham within so complete a curve, that a traveller from Chester-le-Street southward, traversing the city in as direct a line as prac ticable from the New North Road to Elvet, after crossing two bridges in his route, would be on the same side of the stream as before he entered a stream, or crossed a bridge. The rugged banks within the bend are steep and thickly wooded, intersected, more espe cially on the outer bank, with pleasant paths, charming little nooks for love-making, and B 2"], [16, "4 STUNG TO THE QUICK. dotted here and there with seats where strollers or idlers may repose in summer under umbrageous trees, and watch the bright river gliding past. Like Dovedale, it is a marvellous treasury for the artist. At every opening fresh views are visible, fresh combinations of natural and (here) architectural beauty, for the masons of monk and warrior have added a human inte rest to the grandeur and glory already given by God. Alike varied, romantic, and pictu resque, the two places gratify the senses equally, but the mind is differently im pressed. Dovedale awes the soul to reflection by its savage sublimity and solitude. Dur ham laps the same soul in delicious reverie and contemplation. The hand of Deity is alone on one, the chisel of man has marked the other. Pause, \u2014 or skip to the story, impatient reader, while a panorama passes ; should you happen to know Durham, or dislike descrip tion ; but I warn you the scene is wanted, or it would not be here."], [17, "THE WEAR. 5 Follow me, imaginative reader, along the outer bank of the Wear, westerly from the north, to meet the advancing sun. Enter at Framwellgate the steep defile called South Street, where gloomy unshapely houses, tottering with age, frown on the passer as only church property dares to frown. Take breath on the summit as you emerge from the shadow into the sunshine, beaming full on the now one-sided street, and, leaning over the low parapet wall above the banks, or descend ing to the river-side through the first opening, view with attention the magnificent prospect spread out before the inhabitants. Framwellgate Bridge, old and hoary, comes barely within range, but high up, castle aud cathedral on the same foliage-clad stupendous base of rock, with the shining river for a mirror at the foot, and the Prebend's beautiful bridge as an elaborate frame. Farther on, beyond the bridge, the stream is broken into a refreshing fall by the old weir ; and close at hand you see the veriest pigmy of a museum alone on a peninsula,"], [18, "6 STUNG TO THE QUICK. looking more like a mill than a museum, with the water almost laving its walls, as though charitably disposed to wash away some of the dust deposited within. Beyond this, white glimpses of the \" Count's Cottage \" may be seen, like an ancient temple, amidst embowering wood and leaves, the river still shimmering azure, or golden, or green, as it reflects sky or sun, or the trees which tower above, or overhang and dip their tresses like wanton nymphs. Castle and cathedral have lapsed into distance, for we have reached the full sweep of the curve, both wooded steeps in view, and you are standing with me, reader, resting on the rustic rail of the plank bridge in our path. Listen to the murmurs of the miniature cas cade beneath, where two streamlets hot and cold issue from a coal-pit hard by, and leap or trickle over mossy boulders, steaming or sparkling as they rush under fringing ferns, and blend their musical waters ere they mingle with the Wear, to lose their own tem perature, yet not to warm the river one whit."], [19, "THE WEAR. 7 Turn your head to the right, before the river sweeps beyond ken, and a little gate comes into the picture at the end of the shady path. It leads us to the quaint old church of St. Oswald, through a graveyard filled with slabs and memorials, in all shapes and posi tions. A walk between these crumbling stones, flung by Time's children into the maw of Eternity, and through the wide open iron gates, and we are south of the city with the pavement of Church Street beneath our feet, bricks and mortar on either hand, out of sight the cool river and the dancing leaves, yet have our feet trod no bridge, save the plank. This peculiar formation of the Wear may furnish a reason for the nomenclature of South Street, since it follows that although built above the north-west bank of the river, tra vellers going southward may wend that way without entering Durham's main streets, or crossing the water at all. That is a street to try a horse or a nervous driver ; the only marvel being that a vehicle is"], [20, "8 STUNG TO THE QUICK. dragged up its steep ascent by any animal less ponderous and sure-footed than an elephant ! Yet horses, \" to the manner born,\" are driven upwards ordinarily, whether harnessed to cart or carriage, waggon or phaeton, and albeit the beholder might naturally expect the heavily-laden \" traps \" to roll down-hill, bear ing the overbalanced quadrupeds backwards like toys on an incline ; I never yet witnessed such a catastrophe, though I have sat silent with fear and trembling in momentary expec tation of such a crash. But the one hill saves two very little prefer able in Silver Street and New Elvet; the latter by another anomaly being an ancient looking, narrow thoroughfare, with dingy brick houses of many shapes and sizes, some low and some lofty, some with gable fronts and lattice windows, some up steps and some down steps, shops with parlour windows, and parlours which should be shops, and doors as diverse as the windows ; in short, all the glory of irregularity and little of its beauty. Old Elvet, which, situated at right angles,"], [21, "9 THE WEAR. looks up the hill as if with a self-satisfied smirk, is, on the contrary, a broad open street, comparatively modern, or modernised by the abundant introduction of sash windows, pan elled doors, and stucco, or painted plaster; though here and there an outside shutter carries one back to the long-ago."], [22, "CHAPTER II. THE WAIF. Let the leaves fade and drop from the trees I have attempted to picture, let summer pass into winter, and the snow fall thick and heavily, whilst we return to South Street, and mount the summit of the hill in the light of the Christmas moon. There, from the windows of a large old house overlooking the swollen and angry Wear, the light glowed through crimson cur tains in the lower rooms, tinging the snow beneath, or gleamed through the white blinds above, showing that, from \" garret to base ment,\" Christmas kept his state. A babe had been baptised that day, and the season ushered in with a ceremony well befitting it ; Mr. Marsh, the owner of the"], [23, "11 THE WAIF. house and the father of the infant, considering it the most auspicious time for so important a rite. Baby Eva, a tiny pink atom of humanity, lost in a mist of lace and muslin, was the cynosure of the evening, mother and sponsors following in their turns. She was kissed and petted, fondled and admired as surely no baby ever was before ; and if not literally born with a silver spoon in her mouth, friends took care she had no lack of such that day. Mr. Hesketh, her godfather, placed in a hand almost too small to grasp it, a costly coral and bells, whilst the godmothers respectively provided a richly embroidered robe and cloak for an infant whose wardrobe was already more than complete. Forlorn children shiver in rags ! Did the thought occur to these good ladies, plying industrious needles and straining their eyes in decorating the finest of muslin and merino, at how small a cost of labour and coin a poor child might be comfortably clad ? The point is debateable."], [24, "12 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Baby's eyes grew weary ; she signified her aversion to kissing very intelligibly, so nurse (that important personage at a christening) was called in, and the bundle of lace and muslin passed to regions remote, to be dis robed and lulled to sleep on cushions of down beneath a silken quilt. Baby gone, song and dance succeeded ; merry games were called for by merry lips, games which made the mistletoe a necessity. The \" slipper \" was hunted, the \" trencher \" turned, the \" old coach \" door worn off its hinges, and \"Buff said 'Buff\" to all his men.\" Then there was one of those lulls in the pastime, so necessary to refresh the panting players, and prepare for further frolic, when even conversation is at ebb tide. Mr. Marsh had drawn his young wife into the recess of the window, and holding back the heavy curtains, bade her look out on the still night. \" See, Eveline, how calm and peaceful is all without, how delicate the cobweb tracery of snow-wreathed branches against the clear sky;"], [25, "13 THE WAIF. even the solemn music of the river seems a p\u00e6an to Christmas ! How beautiful, and yet how solitary and cold ! What a contrast to the warmth and light within ! Come, darling, let us close the curtains, something chills me. I hope \"\u2014what, remained unsaid. A piercing shriek rang through the clear air, closely followed by a heavy splash into the swollen river. With blanched faces the startled guests, one and all, rushed out, and hurried to the riverside ; some by the ordinary path, close by ; others, more adventurous, leapt over the low wall, down the rugged bank, crushing snow and brushwood in their eager haste. Neighbours, also alarmed, flocked to the spot, and in less time than it takes to tell, the path and steep woody banks were crowded with white-faced men and women rushing to and fro in wild confusion, earnest but helpless. Alas ! the earliest there was all too late : the moon gleaming so coldly, revealed a woman struggling for a moment in the stream some distance down, hurrying onwards in that"], [26, "14 STUNG TO THE QUICK. seething flood through an arch of the ancient bridge to that darker arch which spans the space between Time and Eternity. There was no hope of rescue : none ! The stoutest swimmer would have been a reed in such a flood : the very bridges were threatened with destruction, for the Wear, foaming and frothing in countless eddies, was like a seething cauldron ; and the poor woman \" gone to her death \" so sadly, as it were, in the very presence of mirth and festal, would be miles away ere morn, a swollen corpse. What was that dark object in the path, which Mr. Marsh stumbled over as he turned slowly to retrace his steps ? \" Goodness ! that is the cry of an infant ! \" Surely enough, there, wrapped in an old check shawl, was a child more than six months old, with a wail feeble as that of one newly born. Securing the poor waif, Mr. Marsh hastened to the house whither many of the more apa thetic or selfish of his guests had preceded"], [27, "THE WAIF. 15 him, called \" nurse \" from the crowd, and gave the little orphan to her charge, bespeak ing for it every attention. \" Give it to me, Charlie,\" said the compas sionate voice of Mrs. Marsh ; \" poor little mo therless bairn, I will be a mother to you ! \" and tears rolled down her cheeks as she removed the shawl and revealed a babe, with large black eyes, in sunk and purpled sockets, whose features, pinched with cold and want, seemed marked by that hand which had only now sealed its mother's eyes and breath. \" You surely do not mean to keep the dirty little wretch ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Hes keth, a mature bride of some six weeks. \" Indeed I do, if Charlie will permit me. How could I cast out the helpless little thing whose mother sank to her awful death in my very sight \u2014 on Christmas Eve, too ? \" Mrs. Hesketh lifted her shoulders and eye brows, and pulled down the corners of her mouth, but spoke no word. It was needless, the gesture was sufficient. \" Keep her, by all means, dear Eveline ;"], [28, "16 STUNG TO THE QUICK. she is a Christmas gift for you, a companion for our Eva. How know we but the light and warmth in our snug rooms, the sounds of music and rejoicing, jarred so harshly on yon poor suicide, worn with wrong, and want, and penury, that the very contrast goaded her to madness, and in despair she flung her child to our mercy, herself to the mercy of God ! \" \" Upon my word, Marsh, you are quite eloquent, and \u2014 quite right,\" struck in Mr. Hesketh. \" Still, I do not think I should like to undertake the charge.\" \" I should think not, indeed ! \" sharply exclaimed his wife. \" What should we do with beggars' brats? The workhouse is the fittest place for them ! \" \" Mrs. Hesketh, we think differently. I am proud of my wife's motherly instinct, and feel that we cannot better close the day which recognised our child a Christian, than by per forming a Christian's duty to the little outcast so thrown by Providence in our path. Provi ded no one claims her, she is henceforth ours.\""], [29, "17 THE WAIF. Mrs. Hesketh once more shrugged her shoulders in contemptuous silence, but just then the chimes came booming across the water \u2014 a deafening peal to welcome Christ mas and Christmas charity. Mrs. Marsh had meanwhile carried the poor morsel of life and rags to the nursery, fed it, and warmed its frozen limbs, seen it washed and dressed from Eva's ample stores, and when at length it fell into a calm sleep, blissfully unconscious of what it had lost, or what it had gained, she returned to her friends, while the bells rang merrily out, and the ding-dong pealed over Dur ham, wakening all sleepers but such as the one then sleeping in the waters of the Wear. The infant dreamed in its warm bed \u2014 did the mother dream in her cold one ? Speculation was rife at the abundantly spread supper-table as to the who, what, how, and wherefore, of the startling and tragic event of the night. But was there one amongst the guests who could picture to VOL. I. c"], [30, "18 STUNG TO THE QUICK. himself the scene enacted on the river's brink ere he reached it ? Who saw the maddened woman, bonnet less and shoeless, as she crossed the city, seeking by her very wretchedness the shelter and comfort she was too proud to ask, and no Christian proffered, although it was Christmas Eve? Who saw her crouched beneath the shadow of the lonely arch of the Prebend's Bridge, gnawing a crust that had been flung to her ; huddling her babe to the breast that could not nourish it ; with wrong and outrage seething and surging in her brain like the flood beneath her feet \u2014 resistless, uncon trollable ? Who saw the gibing fiends mocking her misery \u2014 taunting her memory with thoughts of home, of all she had been, all she might have been, and all she had become \u2014 with pictures of feasting and revelry throughout the land, of brides and babes in perfumed rooms and soft attire ? And then, who saw her rise and pace the"], [31, "THE WAIF. 19 path with hurried feet and frenzied mien \u2014 pause \u2014 hurry on \u2014 then turn and turn again, as rose or fell the impulse in her mind, to hide her shame and sorrow in the wave, and save her babe from sin and sorrow too? Who heard her prayers, her agony \u2014 saw the convulsive clutchings of her infant, the passionate kisses rained upon its face, the torturing struggle to keep her child or leave \u2014 her wavering, her wrestling with the demon in her breast, and lastly, the final wrench, when, flinging down her child, she left it to the world from which she fled in despera tion ? Ah, no ! Mortals saw none of this, and what they did see had not stopped the feast, albeit the ladies feigned loss of appetite, and all sat down as though half ashamed to sup so near a newly-made grave. But the Christ mas bells were jubilant, their tones floated sweetly on the air above the suicide, the silence, and the snow \u2014 and Mr. Marsh's friends, cheered by the good things on the c 2"], [32, "20 STUNG TO THE QUICK. ample board, as well as by the rejoicing chimes, rose refreshed and strengthened against a sorrow not their own. The morrow brought Mrs. Marsh gossip ing visitors in shoals to see the little orphan \u2014 visitors who made their comments, and pressed on from house to house, rolling their snowball of news until it o'ertopped the town, which became but an arena to discuss the sad catastrophe, and Mr. Marsh's right to think for himself. Grave divines shook their heads and sighed over the sin of suicide ; untempted misses wondered if the mother had been married ; matrons speculated on the extra care and cost of rearing a strange young child in a house hold ; their spouses on the folly of such self encumbrance in a couple, as likely as not to have a large family of their own ; the parish authorities congratulated themselves on beine well rid of a troublesome burthen ; and Mrs. Hesketh became proverbial and pro phetic on the occasion, asserting that \" the blood of the mother must run in the"], [33, "THE WAIF. 21 child ! \" and she knew \" no good would come of it ! \" None, even the most captious, would, however, deny to the Marshes the grace of Christian charity, and they had that within their own breasts which rendered them impervious to calumny, had it assailed them. New Year's Day brought to the church of St. Oswald, where little Eva was baptised, another but more unobtrusive baptismal party, when the child of adoption received the name of Rhoda, to which Mr. Marsh appended the surname of Wearbank, from the spot on which she was found, no mark being on her clothes to reveal her own patronymic ; if, indeed, she could claim one. A week's care and nourishing diet had wrought a marvellous change in her ; the puny little atomy had grown plump and rosy, her dark eyes no longer gleamed from sunken sockets, the wailing cry had given place to dimpling smiles, and apparelled as"], [34, "22 STUNG TO THE QUICK. she was, in robes befitting her new station in the world, none would have recognised in that healthy child the \" beggar's brat \" whom Mrs. Hesketh would so charitably have consigned to the workhouse."], [35, "CHAPTER III. POISON. Years passed. No other children came to \"put out of joint the noses \" of Eva and her cousin, as she was called, the difference of age being so marked as to disprove twin sisterhood, whilst an elder sister's claim was still more obviously in admissible for Rhoda. Care and tenderness were bestowed on each alike ; no possible distinction was made in their dress, treat ment, or training. Only very close obser vation, coupled with a knowledge of the minute springs of action, could detect the difference between natural parental affection and that arising from sympathy and generous feeling. Mr. Marsh had enjoined on his dependants"], [36, "24 STUNG TO THE QUICK. strict silence regarding the supposed parent age of Rhoda ; and his servants valued him too much to dispute his will. The girls grew up together, unconscious they were not akin ; slept in each other's arms, went hand-in-hand to the same school, affectionate as cousins should be, although they were in all other respects dissimilar as morn and night. Eva, a blue-eyed laughing little fairy, with a halo of flaxen hair around her head, broke into a shady room like a sunbeam, taking the unconscious heart by surprise ; whilst with quiet step and voice, Rhoda seemed to claim her place in your regard with the assumption of an empress, as she shook back her tangled web of Ethiop curls, and lit her lustrous eyes. \" She be a strange bairn,\" Martin, the groom and gardener, would say in confidence to Nancy, the cook, \" aw de think there's summat uncanny aboot her ! \" \" Hout, man ! did ye never see a bairn wi' black hair an' eyes afore, that ye mun"], [37, "25 POISON. call the poor thing ' uncanny ' ?

A sagacious shake of the head, and the words, \" Nay, hinny, it's not her hair, nor her een, though they be wild enough, but her mouth \u2014 her mouth that's uncanny,\" would be his common reply. \"And what's the matter with her mouth, I should like to know ?

No echoes of these disputes penetrated into the parlour to disturb the perfect con tentment of Mr. and Mrs. Marsh with regard to Rhoda, and as the two girls themselves never came into collision, no idea of possible evil in the future ever crossed their benevolent minds. They were not blind to the difference of temperament, but it created no surprise, the tint of Rhoda's skin faintly indicating gipsy or foreign extraction, and the good pair only smiled at the loftiness of her general"], [39, "POISON. 27 bearing ; whilst Mr. Marsh, always disposed to be humorous, appeared to see something comical in her childish grandeur, and patron age of their Eva. For some time after her adoption, Durham, or one half of it, regarded Mr. Marsh as an innovator \u2014 an incendiary, who had brought a bombshell into their midst ; but other people's private affairs drove Mr. Marsh's out of the public mind, and the matter seemed well nigh forgotten by the time the children were old enough to require play mates, or to give juvenile parties. Then the story came into circulation once more, and the first invitation created a ferment amongst the mammas. The grave question, whether Miss Wearbank was eligible to be received into respectable society, was mooted in various quarters, and gave rise to a variety of opinions, more or less warmly expressed. In most cases Mr. Marsh's position was a passport for his protegee ; some few conde scended to permit the desired family inter course, but not a few rejected the advance"], [40, "28 STUNG TO THE QUICK. as an insult, and sent cold negatives to the invitations. The little damsels in short frocks and long trousers, knew nothing of the serious point under discussion, and received or visited their little friends in frocks and trousers in all the blissful ignorance of early childhood. And so matters progressed until the girls attained their twelfth year. It was then judged advisable to place the care of their education in more efficient hands than here tofore. Consequently, after some little deliberation, they were sent to a first-class \" Establishment for Young Ladies,\" in the Bailey \u2014 the aris tocratic quarter, in close proximity and running parallel with Palace, Cathedral, and Castle. It was therefore within the curve of the horse-shoe, and, whilst its chief entrance was from Saddler Street (where a gate and portcullis once stood), there was a passage thence to the opposite side, either through the cloisters, under an archway from Palace Green, or by a pathway beneath the castle"], [41, "toison. 29 walls, and so on over the handsome modern Prebend's Bridge to the outer bank. Here, under the Misses Robson's care, as education progressed, the difference between the two developed rapidly ; not that affection underwent a change, but character asserted itself. Eva learned, and learned well, as a tract able, intelligent child, desirous to please, would ; but Rhoda devoured knowledge, so to speak ; no task she was set but she icould accomplish ; difficulties she set at defiance, and her teachers regarded her as a marvel, although a sort of unpleasant awe mingled with their admiration. Work she disliked ; she would turn with ill-disguised contempt from the embroidery frame at which Eva sat for hours shading a violet, or giving the blush to a rose, or she would throw down her own needlework with a yawn at her own idle ness. She was imperious, too, and had queened it over Eva so long by virtue of her stronger mind, and few months' advanced age, that she"], [42, "30 STUNG TO THE QUICK. assumed a like position in the school \u2014 a position under protest ; but Rhoda's will was dominant. For about eighteen months matters pro gressed much after this kind, since in all communities the strongest will and most active mind leads the mass ; then, after the Midsummer vacation, a fresh pupil entered the school, when a change became gradually perceptible. The new comer was the only child of Mrs. Hesketh (there was a son of Mr. Hesketh by a former marriage, but he was of no account, and had been early shipped to sea) ; a spoiled girl, and an exaggerated copy of her mother, with whom Mrs. Marsh had little intercourse, the distance between their re spective homes serving as a pretext for a domestic wife, in indifferent health, declining invitations, and neglecting to return \" calls.\" In truth there was no unison between the two ladies. There was a coarseness and vulgarity of mind as well as manner in Mrs. Hesketh little"], [43, "31 POISON. in consonance with the gentle spirit of Mrs. Marsh. She was, moreover, a busy-body, devoting her leisure, and more than her leisure, to an active censorship and canvass of her neighbours' acts and motives, leaving her own \"glass-house\" unprotected. Then, too, she was a devotee of dress and fashion, to whom the trimming of a bonnet, or the shape of a sleeve, was of more vital import than her husband's comfort or her daughter's culture. She consulted not taste but the \" Ladies' Cabinet,\" in the selection of her wardrobe, and might be regarded as a milliner's walking model, copying the fashion plates in detail as infallible guides. She had a passion for much trimming and brilliant colours, carried away by a common delusion that to be expen sively dressed was to be well dressed. As may be supposed, Mrs. Marsh had little sympathy with her conversation or pursuits, and, though the friendship of the two gentle men remained undiminished, from the memo rable Christmas Eve when Mrs. Hesketh's tendencies were so repulsively manifest, their"], [44, "32 STUNG TO THE QUICK. acquaintance gradually declined, Mrs. Marsh, a pure and high-minded woman, holding more aloof as her children became of an age to observe and receive impressions. The younger members of the two families were therefore little better than strangers ; but there are no strangers in schools, and Rhoda soon found not only rebellion in her realm, but a rival. Miss Hesketh had a will as well as herself \u2014 a self-asserting, braggart will, and the school was split into two parties. Rhoda held her own with dignity ; the interloper was younger, and she thought to put her down with her eyes, as others had been cowed. But she mistook her strength ; dignity is no shield from innate vulgarity or the spleen of a little mind, as Rhoda found to her cost. One day a dispute having arisen in the playground, Rhoda volunteered a decision meant to be conclusive, but Miss Hesketh stepped forward, and, with a lack of delicacy surely inherited, poured forth a torrent of"], [45, "33 POISON. invective which caused Rhoda to stand aghast with fiery eyes, and Eva to shed tears like a fountain . \" And pray, Miss Wearbank, who made you a ruler amongst us ?

Great was the consternation in the house, which was not allayed when Eva followed, out of breath with haste and tears, and gave a broken account of the scene in the play ground, choking her narrative with sobs. Dr. Grove, their medical man, was sent for and was promptly in attendance, but convulsion followed convulsion, mocking at remedies, and threatening life itself.

Being questioned, then, as gently and ten derly as possible, with a womanly care lest she should inflict pain, did Mrs. Marsh un fold to Rhoda the circumstances attending her mother's death, the discovery of herself in the snow, with their adoption of, and goodwill towards, the helpless little stranger.

Sleepless, though feigning sleep, with im mobile face, half buried in the soft pillows, this girl, not quite fifteen, lay calculating whether Mr. Marsh had benefited her in his adoption, as much as he had wronged her in bestowing a name which perpetuated a memory, and was itself a stigma ? Was it not admitted by her aunt that her wretched mother's doom was probably hastened by the sight and sound of revelry in their warm home, whilst she was shut out to perish in the snow? Then she argued with herself, as wretched ness itself has argued for thousands of years, what right had they to luxuries whilst her mother was starving ? Why should they mock her misery with light, music, and mer riment, whilst she stood shelterless under the cold sky ? They had taken her in !

At first, Mrs. Hesketh was disposed to be flippant, to treat the matter lightly, and throw the onus of the affair on Mr. Marsh's own impolicy in obtruding a beggar-girl into the society of young ladies. But for his just indignation she was little prepared. She had been accustomed to regard and speak of him as \" an easy, good tempered, charitable sort of man, with no great harm in him,\" but she had never cared to calculate how much good was in him, or how much spirit lay under that easy ex terior. Disgusted by her unfeeling and Un womanly reception of his first mild observa tions and remonstrances, he warmed with his subject, and a second contemptuous reference to the origin of Rhoda caused him to say \u2014 \" Mrs. Hesketh, Miss Wearbank's pa- rentage is most likely as pure and good as your own.\""], [60, "48 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" I should like to know how you are to prove it,\" retorted she. \" Are you, madam, in a position to dis prove it?

The judges of the Ecclesiastical Court are not wont to be lenient to such offenders, I can assure you.\" All the flippancy was gone. This vague threat of a shadowy court with unknown pre rogatives had filled her with apprehensions of she knew not what. With the natural cow ardice of a little mind she shrank from the indefinite more than the positive, and col lapsed at once. The pocket-handkerchief went to her eyes. \" I am sure, Mr. Marsh,\" sobbed she, \" I never meant to slander or defame either Miss Wearbank or any one else ; I never said any thing more than the truth of her : I never slandered any one in my life ; I am sure I never did.\" \" Gossip very easily degenerates into scandal, and scandal passes into slander much more readily than chattering women are aware.

Fortunately there is a law to reach the woman who stabs her neighbour's reputation, and poisons peace, as well as the midnight assassin who preys on the lives of men. Branding or burning in the tongue is not one whit too severe a punishment for the offence.\" Taken by surprise, these indirect and rather apocryphal threats subdued the blustering woman completely. Utterly cowed by terror, her submission was abject, and when Mr. Marsh left the house she had offered to sign anything if he would but forego his intended appeal to ecclesias tical justice. So thoroughly had he been in earnest when denouncing the evil of unbridled speech, that his menace had all the force of truth.

To have taken counsel with her bosom friend would have been of no avail : what did Mrs. Coulson know of slumbering laws ? be sides, it would be owning herself worsted by \" those odious Marshes ;\" so for once in her life she consulted her husband. Of course he magnified the \" pains and penalties \" that clerical judges had the power to inflict ; gave his friend Marsh a character for an uncompromising love of justice ; stern and pitiless as Brutus, unyielding and unforgiving; a character the good man would never have recognised as his own. It answered the purpose. That evening- Mr. Hesketh (chuckling at a man\u0153uvre which promised peace at home for some time to come) carried to South Street a carefully worded document, signed by Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy, containing all Mr. Marsh had re quired, and much superadded by the gleeful scrivener."], [68, "56 STUNG TO THE QUICK. But when he saw the change a few hours had wrought in the poor sufferer, his glee was turned to sorrow, and he felt that no enforced silence in the future could repair the mischief wrought in the past.

She punished to relieve herself, not to cor rect her child. In proportion as she was exasperated with Mr. Marsh for coercing her will, with herself for yielding to coercion, and with Rhoda as the primary cause, so was she exasperated with Lucy as the secondary cause, and so Lucy was beaten. But the spirit the mother had so long admired and applauded in her daughter was a rebellious one. She struck at her mother again \u2014 blows, and words that hit her harder than blows. This provoked severe retaliation, and then Lucy was sent to bed in dudgeon, no better for the beating. Mrs. Hesketh bemoaned her lot, and when Mr. Hesketh reached home at night indulged in a fit of hysterics. The Misses Robson reprimanded their refrac tory pupil sharply. There was some talk of expulsion ; but after three or four interviews"], [71, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 59 with Mrs. Hesketh, matters were compro mised, and Miss Lucy remained on sufferance. Of course, though the principals of the school were in no way accountable for the recent disaster, Eva could not be permitted to return to companions who might prejudice her young mind against Rhoda. She was accordingly sent to Sunderland to be educated with the daughters of a clergy man, who received a few pupils into his home to eke out a somewhat narrow income. Not until the following spring was Rhoda deemed sufficiently convalescent to resume her studies : and then Dr. Grove strongly advised sea-air ; the farther south the better. If he had a reason beyond the restoration of his patient's bodily health, he prudently kept it'to himself. He was a cautious man ; never gave an opinion without sufficient motive or delibera tion ; and his medical dictum was decisive. Scarborough was named \u2014 Mrs. Marsh remembered that that was the Heskeths' summer retreat. Blackpool was proposed ; it"], [72, "60 STUNG TO THE QUICK. was too bleak : finally, Brighton was pitched upon as at once salubrious, distant from ad verse influences, fashionable, and abounding with \" Establishments \" where young ladies might be \" finished \" on most approved prin ciples. Mr. Marsh was desirous that the two girls should share the same advantages ; but whether the mother's instinct told her that Eva would be unhappy amidst the frigid etiquette and ceremonial of a fashionable school, or that she had unconsciously imbibed something of Martin's undefined dread of Rhoda, certain it is that she opposed the plan, \u2014 and wisely. Eva had a heart to be cultivated, Rhoda a head. Accordingly, after answering numerous scholastic advertisements, Mr. Marsh made his selection, and prepared to accompany his protegee to Brighton. Eva came over from Sunderland to spend a week at home prior to Rhoda's departure, bringing with her Mary Reed, one of the"], [73, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 61 clergyman's daughters ; a simple-hearted, intelligent girl of sixteen. Mary was one of those unassuming do mestic beings at home and of use anywhere ; so she was soon as busy as Eva, providing and completing such little matters for the traveller's outfit as lay beyond the province of milliner or dress-maker ; Rhoda herself looking on with apparently listless in difference. She was by no means as indifferent as she appeared. She watched with jealous eyes every article provided for her comfort or convenience, use or ornament, to assure herself whether she would be as amply supplied as Eva ; she had never called her cousin since the truth had been forced upon her. Seemingly she was satisfied with the con tents of her well-filled trunks, no discontent being expressed in word, or tone, or gesture. Still Mrs. Marsh looked in vain for any open sign of interest in their proceedings, or grati fication at the results ; aud she^ sighed at"], [74, "62 STUNG TO THE QUICK. a change at once so complete and inex plicable. Unsuspicious herself, and all unconscious of the jealous worm gnawing at Rhoda's heart, she was willing to attribute this seeming lack of interest in her own equipments to the list lessness occasioned by a long and debilitating fever ; nor saw the more fierce and dangerous fever raging in the soul, to the annihilation of all that was good and noble. Had Mrs. Marsh been more a woman of the world, possessed of nicer discrimination, she might have discerned the minute shades of difference between this sullen apathy and the natural languor of debility. She might, with womanly tact, have applied a remedy to the festering sore in time ; but the even tenor of her life, her own goodness, and inexperience in evil, unfitted her to sound the depths of the strong nature in her charge. Unaware how deep and dark a tide of fierce passions lay beneath that unimpressionable exterior, she saw not the black waters ooze and drip through the gap Lucy Hesketh had"], [75, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 63 made in the floodgates of principle and affec tion, threatening in time to break down the barriers altogether. Even keen-eyed Dr. Grove was baffled by the reticence of Rhoda. That something was wrong beyond the reach of medicine, he saw ; but as his visits terminated with her actual physical ailments, his opportunities for obser vation ceased, and in the multitude of his professional engagements he almost forgot the strange dark-eyed girl whose case had inte rested him so unusually. As for Mr. Marsh, he mistook her silence for melancholy, and strove assiduously to dis sipate it by little pleasantries, cheerful sallies, and short excursions to neighbouring places of historic or picturesque interest, under the impression that change of manner would follow change of scene.

Martin, who drove the travellers to Leam side, looked after the retreating carriages with an ominous shake of the head, and the mut tered words, \" I hope we may nut rue the day we fund that bairn : she's nut canny ! she is nut canny!\" After a week spent in futile endeavours to rouse Rhoda from her seeming apathy, by efforts to interest her in the scenery around Brighton, Mr. Marsh left her at Milton House, with the hope, earnestly expressed, that the society of young ladies of her own age, who knew her only as his niece, would cure her of her morbid fancies, and the fresh sea breeze restore her to health and cheerfulness. Eva, so near home, often in her mother's arms, the recipient of healthful counsel and affectionate regard, progressed towards matu- rity with as fresh a bloom on her heart as on her cheek."], [77, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 65 Not so Rhoda ! Lucy Hesketh had planted a thorn in her breast, which, taking root in fruitful soil, had been fed with gloomy fancies until she looked at life from under the shadow of the evil tree, and distilled venom from its leaves. All that had been done for her by her benefactors in singleness of heart, her dis tempered fancy changed to wrong and insult. In her removal to a distance, she conceived she was thrust out of their own home as if she had a taint upon her, they using her ill ness as a pretext. She utterly ignored the fact (which met her at every turn) that Mr. Marsh was paying almost double for her education than what Eva's cost him.

Rhoda, roused to observation, detected this. It was buzzed about that Miss Nichols bore her mother's name only, and why ; and then it was that Rhoda learned what was worse than beggary. From that time forth Rhoda took the pupil teacher under her protection. There was a bond of sympathy between them she feared to reveal, yet which existed nevertheless, unknown to all around.

The possibility that Lucy Hesketh had a foundation for her taunt, ate into her heart like a canker. And as the hideous possibility rose before her from the mist in all its grim significance, a shadowy purpose rose by its side, dim and undefined, to take shape at some future day. Distance barred vacations. Once or twice her aunt or uncle made a summer trip to Brighton to see her, and share a pleasant holiday, and once Eva accompanied them; but she had never seen home, or asked to return. Before the expiration of her third year, she was hastily summoned back. Mrs. Marsh, long an invalid, was on her death-bed. Surely, then, some feeling of grateful remembrance filled her soul, some sorrow for the matchless friend she was about to lose? F 2"], [80, "68 STUNG TO THE QUICK. No ! Malign memories had spun thick cobwebs over kindness past, and anger at her recall from the school where she held undis puted pre-eminence, to a state of dependence and hum-drum household duties, with possible contumely looming in the distance, crushed back all softer feelings, and thrust a polished semblance in the place of grateful love. So, when the train arrived at Leamside (then the nearest station to Durham) a little before the time, and Martin a few minutes too late, she chafed at what she construed into a premeditated slight, and at once proceeded with haughty independence to discuss with the railway porters and a gentleman who had been a fellow-passenger, from London, the possibility of obtaining at so late an hour a conveyance for herself and luggage. As Martin drove up, his first glance fell upon two glittering eyes set in a stony face (he saw the stately figure afterwards), and involuntarily he ejaculated, \" I hope that's not Miss Rhoda ! \""], [81, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 69 She recognised him as he advanced, and the look passed like magic from her face ; but the old man never forgot it \u2014 never!

Fortunately the horse was sure-footed, and knew the road as well as his driver, for he was driven mechanically, but he went up hill and down dale, or turned the sharpest of sharp corners, without a stumble. To his unfailing confidante Martin dis burdened his mind of its disagreeable im pressions, but the sympathy he obtained was an impatient shake of Nancy's shoulders, and the hasty exclamation, \" Hout, man, dinnot thee deave me with thy megrims, the bairn's all right enough an' thou'll let her a' be.\" So Martin marched off to the stable, muttering to himself, and reposing in Towzer, his bull-terrier, the remainder of his rejected confidence.

Eva clasped her slender arms round her cousin's neck and wept aloud, half in Welcome and half in grief; and the flood gates of her tears once opened, they flowed freely. The frail invalid, at whose desire she had been summoned, smiled faintly when she entered the sick chamber, and extended her hand to the child of her adoption, then a tall and stately girl, close upon eighteen, with self-possession in every lineament.

After the funeral, Mary Reed came to spend a short time in the cathedral city as a companion to Eva and Rhoda. She was a gentle, amiable girl, and her presence served to dull the edge of grief in the two hearts which sorrowed most, her sympathy being as certain and genuine as it was unobtrusive.

Eva's name, an honourable and unsullied one ; her own, the brand of outcast impurity. Between Mary and Rhoda a species of in stinctive antipathy arose \u2014 a sort of latent moral antagonism, which neither could ac count for nor control. Mary sought to subdue the feeling as illiberal and ungenerous ; but Rhoda con tented herself with concealing dislike under a bland and suave exterior, endeavouring to ingratiate herself with the clergyman's daugh ter, as with others, by little courtesies and delicate attentions, which Eva, dear, genuine Eva, loving her friend with honest warmth, never dreamt of, not being on the watch to prove that which was undoubted. One day, Mary received a letter from home \u2014 not that the arrival of a letter from home was an event so rare as to call for special notice, even though the penny postage did not then exist, and a Sunderland letter cost four pence ; nor did this epistle contain domestic"], [89, "\"the lass that loves a sailor.\" 77 intelligence of more than average interest ; \u2014 but there was a postscript \u2014 a postscript which brought the warm blood mantling to Mary's face, and a moisture to her hazel eyes, which might have been mistaken for tears had she not looked so radiantly happy. Whilst she and Eva were closeted together, discussing this important addendum to an unimportant epistle, the reader, privileged to look back into the past, or forward into the future, may glance over their shoulders and decipher it. \" The 'Polly' has just entered the harbour. When may we expect you home ? \" Two very laconic and apparently dis connected sentences ; but the feminine bustle which ensued thereupon proved a particularly intimate relation between them.

With many gracefully worded expressions of fear lest she should inconvenience Mrs. Reecl, to whom she was personally a stranger, Rhoda accepted the tardy invitation from motives peculiarly her own ; jotting down in her mental note-book that it toas tardy. Under the playful conversation held in her presence, there was some little mystery to which she did not hold a clue. It might have been withheld from her purposely \u2014 it might from the accident of her long estrangement from home ; in any case, if she made one of the party, the secret, though only a love story, should soon be hers to use as she saw fit.

She felt herself a cipher in the presence of Mary and Eva, notwithstanding her superior accomplishments ; felt that they had in their free and congenial intercourse con fidences she did not share. She longed for something to break the monotony of her life, to occupy her mind, and yearned once more for activity and power.

On the platform at Leamside, in earnest conversation with the station-master, stood a gentleman of elegant exterior, whose age might be about three-and-twenty. His form was graceful and well proportioned, his features singularly prepossessing, and round his ample forehead clustered a mass of wavy hair, black as his garb. With a slight smile of recognition he raised his hat respectfully as our party passed, and Rhoda gracefully inclined her head in acknowledgment. \" Who is the gentleman you bowed to, Rhoda ? \" asked Mr. Marsh. \" Oh, he travelled in the same carriage with me all the way from London, and was extremely polite and attentive.

Rhoda was rallied on her conquest of a \" mysterious stranger,\" a \" count in dis guise\", and her secrecy was voted to be a direct evidence against the state of her heart, she of course disclaiming the \" soft impeachment \" though evidently pleased with the importance it gave her, if nothing more."], [95, "\"THE LASS THAT LOVES A SAILOR.\" 83 In the midst of their fun Eva expressed an opinion, that it \" was not fair Rhoda should have the beau all to herself, if she did not care for him \u2014 they had better draw lots which he should belong to ! \" \" Come between us if you dare ! \" said Rhoda's eyes in a flash. \" You are welcome to him altogether, if you want him,\" said her flexile lips and finished tongue. The subject dropped soon after, Mary seeming pre-occupied and anxious to reach home, and Eva \" wondering if any one would meet them.\" The stranger passed from their minds com pletely. If he retained a place in Rhoda's she hid him there, for no one knew. \" Sunderland at last ! \" exclaimed Mary, as the engine screeched, and gave a few pre liminary puffs before stopping. \" Sunderland at last, and no one to meet us ! \" \" No one ! yes, here is your father ! \" inter posed Eva, pushing through the crowd towards the clergyman who was peering into all faces and carriages but the right one. g2"], [96, "84 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" Rhoda, I must introduce you ; our discon solate Mary will forget us else.

Mary's younger sister Maggie stood on the threshold to receive them. The whispered words, \" In father's study \" answered the un spoken question, and Mary herself dis appeared somewhat precipitately, leaving her guests to other care. Nor was other care wanting : Eva was evi dently at home, and Mrs. Reed, a quiet matron with pleasant smile and cheerful voice {of whom Mary was but the younger coun terpart) did her utmost to render Rhoda at \u2022home also.

At length Eva, laughingly protesting that her appetite would be gone if she waited much longer, volunteered to go in quest of the truant, and after a little while returned in triumph with Mary, blushing like a carnation, and a frank sun-burned sailor, whom she solemnly and with mock gravity introduced to Rhoda as \" Captain Cuth bert Hesketh, Miss Reed's most particular friend ! \" Did a wasp sting Rhoda that she started so perceptibly at the introduction ? or was it only one of those convenient spasms she had been subject to since a Hesketh stung her first, and poisoned all the blood in her heart ?

Cuthbert Hesketh seemed entranced. Mr. Reed said he did not think there had been so much music in the old instru ment ; and all expressed most unqualified delight. Perhaps, however, at the bottom of Mary's heart there might have lurked a little \u2014 a very little spice of envy or chagrin ; for although a model of amiability, Mary was but mortal, and to her Cuthbert appeared a little more fascinated than was altogether proper.

She sang the old ballad, \" Mary's Dream,\" in which a young girl sees the white face of her sailor lover who has been drowned \" far, far at sea,\" and sang it with such touching pathos that a tear stole down the bronzed cheek of Cuthbert, and for getting alike place and propriety, he pressed a hearty kiss on Mary's lips.

The good clergyman sat in his customary arm-chair near the fire-place, although there was no fire (the season being unusually warm) and a grate-apron of coloured tissue paper cut into porcupine points, covered the cold bars.

Young and buoyant, her mournful tears were soon dried, then her glance, wandering around the room, discerned amongst the cases of foreign birds, Indian baskets, shells and coral, which decorated the square piano, the walls and shelf-sideboards, something new, which Cuthbert (whose gifts ail these were) had brought home on his recent voyage. It was nothing more than an ordinary pickle-bottle ; but it contained something closely resembling freshly gathered cranberries with the stalks attached. Eva jumped from her stool to examine it closely, then returned to have her ignorance enlightened and her curiosity satisfied.

At first she looked idly at the people passing through the street, then her eye roved to a saucer on the window-ledge filled with some seductive fluid to allure and destroy unwary vagrant flies. As she watched the unsuspicious insects hover over the miniature pool, and, regardless of their dead and dying friends, loiter on the brink of destruction, or dip their tiny trunks into the sweet poison, she asked herself if there were not human flies as heedless, and as easily allured ? Absorbed in her new study she lost sight of Eva and hers, until from the weed and the gulf-stream the discourse drifted naturally to the voyage and the voyager who brought it.

He was anxious to see his son settled, with a home of his own, a home where he himself would find repose and a welcome ; which was more than he could say of the house in old Elvet. Besides, he was not too well satisfied with the excessive deference and attention Cuthbert paid to Miss Wearbank, nor with her recep tion of the same, and would fain have seen him married to a sensible well-meaning girl like Mary; safe from the lures of those bewil dering black eyes. Something of this Rhoda must have seen in his face, heard in his tones, for she remem bered he was present when she was found.

More bent on her object than ever, day by day, little by little, did this subtle enchantress weave her spells around the unsuspecting sailor ; so delicately, that not even Mary could accuse her of flirtation or scheming. Mary felt the evil influence, but could not define it ; Cuthbert felt it and strove to shake it off; strove manfully against a fascination which was fast warping the love and faith of years, yet strove ineffectually."], [119, "THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. 107 It was therefore no slight relief to Mary when Mr. Marsh announced his intention to \" pop over and take his girls home, he was so confoundedly lonely.\" The morning came clear and bright, and with it Mr. Marsh, who proposed, as soon as the dinner cloth was withdrawn that they should go down to the wharf and take Cuthbert by surprise. A famous opportunity for Rhoda, who did not care to let her prize slip through her fingers without an effort to strengthen the net she had so carefully woven ! Captain Hesketh was on the wharf, giving orders to a couple of barefooted, bareheaded, barebreasted seamen, with tarry hands and tarry trowsers, as unlike the trim conventional stage sailor, as a Newcastle collier and the Lord Mayor's state barge. His greeting of Mr. Marsh and Eva was warm in the extreme ; his reception of Rhoda and Mary not less cordial, but there was also an evident embarrassment which betrayed inward perturbation ?"], [120, "108 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Other vessels lay between the \" Polly \" and the wharf, connected as usual by planks from gangway to gangway. Over these Mary and Eva tripped readily enough, either from custom or fearlessness ; but Rhoda, with the prettiest show of timidity, trembled to put a foot on the boards, until Captain Hesketh, with many assurances of their safety, handed her across ; an attention for which he was thanked with such eloquent eyes, no wonder he was dazzled. No sooner on board than her curiosity and surprise were excited by everything she saw, having, as she said, \" never trod the deck of any vessel larger than a Brighton pleasure boat.\" Of course she must examine the barque from stem to stern, her interest increasing at every step ; and, of course, the captain must be her equally interested cicerone. There were hatchways to peep down, narrow steps to be helped down, cabins to explore, lockers to examine, a compass to be boxed, and rigging described ; all of which kept the pair"], [121, "THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. 109 in pretty close proximity. Isolation from the rest of the party, who, being familiar with the \"Polly,\" did not care to follow, was the natural result. Mary began to feel not a little uneasy at the prolonged inspection, and more than a little piqued at Cuthbert's evident forgetful ness of her own presence on board, her annoyance by no means diminishing when they at length made their appearance after Mr. Marsh's loud call : \" Are you two going to be all day looking at spars and canvas ? \" and her eager ears caught these earnest whispered words, in the sweetest of sweet tones : \" I shall never forget this day, captain ! \" and his low but impressive response, \u2014 \" Nor /, Miss Wearbank.\" Recrossing the planks brought a return of timid hesitancy, and Cuthbert of course to her assistance. Once more by her side, there Rhoda detained him during the homeward walk, which Eva enlivened by banter and raillery on her cousin's unexpected nervous-"], [122, "110 STUNG TO THE QUICK. ness, raillery which delighted Rhoda, for Mary winced, and she saw it. After their early tea, Mr. Marsh proposed that \"the bairns should enliven them with a some music. Eva \u2014 good-natured, unsuspicious Eva \u2014 not conscious of the storm brooding over that hospitable hearth, sang cheerily for the delec tation of all who cared to hear her ; Maggie, too, playing over her latest lessons, essayed to please ; and versatile Rhoda enchanted the ear, not only with her brilliant execution on the piano, but with the exquisite tones of her rich clear voice, attuned as it was that night with pathos and tenderness. Alas ! for poor Mary ! her temper was sorely tried; agitation rendered her musical efforts a miserable failure, the very conscious ness of inferiority cramping her fingers and loading her voice. Never did she appear to less advantage, and never was syren more successful than Rhoda. Mary had yet another pull at her heart strings, when Mr. Marsh pressed Cuthbert to"], [123, "THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. 111 call when he came to Durham; and Rhoda with a wistful glance and the faintest of faint sighs, supplemented the invitation, which the recreant lover seemed only too ready to accept. Could Rhoda, as the swift train whirled them along the iron road that night, have looked into the parlour they had quitted, her triumph would have been complete. There were tears and angry words, accusation and proud retort, where love and peace had reigned supreme. Mary and Cuthbert quarrelled for the first time \u2014 not as the shallow-hearted or petulant, who quarrel over straws, kiss and are friends again every time they meet \u2014 but as those who love quarrel, when the wound is deep, and the one in the wrong does not care to confess or atone. It is true, Cuthbert's conscience accused him of trifling with Mary, but not finding the process of self-accusation comfortable, he strove to justify his conduct under the plea that \" Mary had no right to be jealous of his attentions to any girl. He thought"], [124, "112 STUNG TO THE QUICK. nothing of Miss Wearbank \u2014 at least, nothing to care a rope's end about, until Mary's confounded jealousy provoked him ; nor did he care much now, though she was so taut and trim ; but he would show Mary he could cast anchor in any harbour he chose, and was free to do it; he was neither moored for life nor stranded yet ! \" And so they parted \u2014 in sorrow and anger. Months would pass, and seas roll between their divided hearts ere they might meet again ! The sunlight would fade from Mary's future, and the rose-tint from her cheek, while the pitiful (not pitiless) round of daily life and household routine went on as usual, and while Rhoda laughed and chatted and intrigued as though there were no sorrow nor suffering in the world \u2014 but her own."], [125, "CHAPTER IX. OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. Shortly after their return home, as they sat at breakfast one morning, Mr. Marsh sang out in a blithe voice, though without a particle of music, \" Busk ye, busk ye, my bonnie, bonnie bairns ! I intend to bring home a beau this evening ; but I must warn you, half the marriageable belles in Durham are dying for him, so don't you two pull caps for the swain, lest I should object to pay the milliner's bill.\" \"Who is he, papa?

There are gentlemen in Brighton as elsewhere, no doubt, but it swarms with foplings and adventurers ; and Rhoda has not been wise enough to discriminate between the dandy on horseback and the gentleman on foot. How ever, I will bring my ' bumpkin ' home to night. If he commit any particular solecism in good manners, we need not repeat the invitation.\" \" Well, but, papa, do \u2014 \" \" No ; I will not tell you his name till he comes ! Give me my hat.

Why, Rhoda, I say ! what are you dreaming of \u2014 men or moonshine ?\" and the lightsome little lady laid her hand lightly on her cousin's shoulder. Slowly turning her large dreamy eyes from the window, thus recalled to herself, Rhoda replied, carelessly, \" Both, perhaps. But what do you want ? \" \" Want ? why you, to be sure !

Then the young ladies bethought them selves that their dress was rather heavy, and it became really essential that their mourning garb should be relieved with plain white collars and cuffs ; and as their wardrobes had not yet been supplied with the said \"essen tials,\" a shopping expedition became indispen sable. A brisk walk to the market-place, a leisurely survey of all the book-muslin collars and cuffs in their draper's show-room, a tardy selection, and then the twain hurried home to be in time for dinner, Eva talking all the way she went, and thinking of anything but what was before her; so that, as she turned the corner from Silver Street to Framwellgate Bridge, she ran almost into the arms of a gentleman coming in the opposite direction. She blushed, apologised, and so did he, lifting his hat to Rhoda as they passed on. \" I declare, Rhoda, if that is not your"], [130, "118 STUNG TO THE QUICK. ' count in disguise ! ' What a stupid I was. I quite bumped against him.\" \" Yes, you never look before you.

A young lady should be equally a lady, whether in a room or in the street, with friends or with strangers,\" was Rhoda's very prompt and pertinent retort. \" Ah, well ! but I can't talk going up this hill ; my breath's gone. South Street will kill me before long. Don't Hook consumptive?\" and she laughed and gasped all the rest of the way home. At dinner, Mr. Marsh was obdurate. He would not lift the veil from the \" country bumpkin ; \" and as a little curiosity unsatisfied fans itself into a great curiosity, each young lady in her own room, whilst dressing, speculated in her own way on the pro bable peculiarities of their visitor expectant."], [131, "OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. 119 Evening came at length, bringing with it Mr. Marsh, and Rhoda's railway companion, against whom Eva had run so unceremoniously a few hours before. \" Mr. Raeburn, \u2014 my daughter Eva, \u2014 my niece, Miss Wearbank.\" The gentleman bowed, and with a pleasant smile, said, \" I believe I have had the plea sure of meeting these ladies before.\" \" Indeed ! \" said Mr. Marsh, \" I have certainly some recollection that my niece told me you two had travelled together ; but had no idea you and Eva had ever met.\" \" Oh, yes ! and Miss Marsh made a striking impression on me when we did meet ! \" was the gallant and rather pointed rejoinder. \" That means, papa, that I was so clumsy as to run right against Mr. Raeburn as we were hurrying home for dinner,\" explained the blushing Eva. \" Yes,\" chimed in Rhoda, \" and she con gratulated herself that the gentleman was a stranger, and therefore it did not matter.\" \" Well, stranger or friend, I can but beg"], [132, "120 STUNG TO THE QUICK. pardon, like a good little girl, and promise never to do so any more.\" \" And I, Miss Marsh, can but grant the pardon, and absolve you from the promise,\" replied Mr. Raeburn, answering Eva's mock courtesy with as solemn a bow. \" There, there, that will do ; never mind compliments. I want my tea ! Now, Mar tin, put the urn on that side for Miss Rhoda; bring in the comestibles and my slippers, and we will have a cosy evening. Mr. Raeburn, you must separate those girls to keep them from quarrelling. By-the-way, Rhoda, did you meet many ' country bumpkins ' during your morning walk, eh ? \" \" A few, in various disguises,\" was her cool reply, no ways disconcerted by the allusion, presuming their guest to be in igno rance of the morning's conversation.

Mr. Raeburn did not evince the marked"], [134, "122 STUNG TO THE QUICK. surprise at Rhoda's surpassing skill which Eva expected. Whether it was that having seen much of the world and polished society, he had become accustomed to \" delicacy of touch,\" and \" brilliance of .execution,\" or that Eva's easy unaffected style pleased him by its very novelty \u2014 or that he was too well bred to compliment one lady at the expense of another ; certain it is, that his satisfaction was so equally and unequivocally expressed, that, later in the evening, Eva consented with scarcely any hesitation to accompany him in Carpenter's then popular duet of \" The Mariner,\" commencing \u2014 \u25a0 \" Oh mariner ! oh mariner ! that eomest from the sea, Say will the angry billows bring my true love back to me Say are the tempests terrible that come upon the main, My love is on the sea ; oh ! will it give him back again ?'

More music and singing, and then an hour's social chat, a north-country supper, and a leave-taking, when the \" bumpkin \" was invited by Mr. Marsh to repeat the visit. This, as might be expected, was but the prelude to many other \" cosy evenings,\" in the enjoyment of which Mr. Raeburn partici pated. Sometimes music was superseded by a quiet rubber of whist ; sometimes he brought with him a new book, and read aloud, with a rich, well-modulated voice ; while the young ladies plied their needles or knitting-pins. Indeed, so agreeable did the young gentle man render himself on these occasions, that his presence began to be looked for as the principal ingredient towards the pleasure of the evening. Mr. Marsh was delighted. He rubbed his hands and chuckled gleefully at every fresh indication that the \"bumpkin\" was high in the good graces of both his \"bairns\" \u2014 and that he was, soon became apparent. Old Martin pondered whether \" that foine"], [136, "124 STUNG TO THE QUICK. young gentleman wor puttin oop te his young mestress, or te that black-eyed lass ! \" specu lation in the kitchen often preceding either speculation or perception in the parlour. However, so equally balanced were Mr. Raeburn's attentions to the cousins, that it would have required a shrewd observer to determine towards which his fancy inclined ; \u2014 if, indeed, he had a warmer feeling than friendship for either of them. Cuthbert Hesketh's visit to his father was not long delayed. When the \"Polly\" had discharged her cargo, and his actual presence in Sunderland was not imperative, he hastened to Durham. The frigid reception he met from his step mother, and the pert greeting of Lucy, were no inducements to prolong his stay in the house that was not home. Not even the cordial welcome of his sire, proud of the impulsive and warm-hearted sailor \u2014 a sac-simile of him self at the same age \u2014 could atone for their lukewarmness. jN'o wonder, then, that father and son"], [137, "OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. 125 should be seen that evening wending their way towards the hospitable residence of their old friend, where they were certain of a genuine and hearty welcome from the whole household \u2014 from Mr. Marsh, down to Martin and his dog Towzer \u2014 as ugly a brute as ever contrived to ingratiate himself into the favour of a master. \" What cheer, messmate, what cheer ? \" was Cuthbert's salutation, as the old man opened the door. \"Why, Maister Cuthbert, is that you?

During this brief dialogue Mr. Hesketh had opened the parlour door to announce himself. Eva instantly (before any one else saw him) sprang forward, and, clasping both arms round his neck, kissed him affectionately. \" Dear godfather ! \" cried she. \" You good old soul, I am so delighted to see you.

Suppose we picture the group in that com fortable, but old-fashioned drawing-room, when the new arrivals were seated and engaged in pleasant, if desultory chat. Close by the open window sat Eva, for the benefit of the light, her fair hair falling in long ringlets on a frame and canvas, over which she bent, working very rapidly between the gaps in conversation. She was embroi dering in various shades of lilac wool with a long simple stitch, a sort of Vandyke pattern, intended when finished for one of those hand kerchief bags, without which no lady's toilet was complete at that day. Her dress was composed of closely fitting black paramatta, with band and buckle at the waist ; the VOL. I.

The neck, which would otherwise have been bare \u2014 the bodice rising little above the shoulders \u2014 was cov ered delicately by a large transparent muslin collar with a broad hem, to match the closely fitting cuffs. We in 18G7 should scarcely vote Eva's dress scant in the petticoat, but then in '39 it was fashionably full (not gored) and fell in very graceful folds as far as it 4 could fall, though it was short enough to dis play the black silk stocking and sandaled slipper which set off a very dainty foot and ancle. Long jet earrings, to match her brooch and buckle, completed her mourning garb, of which Rhoda's was a precise counterpart. The latter, tall and stately, as her cousin was small and lithe, had been netting a long crimson purse, but put it down on the entrance of visitors, having work of more importance on hand. Cuthbert, who had placed himself at the"], [143, "A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. 131 window near her work-table, as bringing him closer to herself (though she had fallen back a little more within the shadow of the sombre curtain), began fingering the silken trifle, much as though he were breaking the tenth commandment, and entangling himself and her purse-twist at the same time. It is scarcely necessary to describe Cuth bert's attire. The sailor thirty or forty years back and the sailor to-day is one and the same ; the same gold band on the officer's cap, the same careless neckerchief, the same blue jacket and vest, and in equally warm weather, the same white trousers and thin shoes tied on the instep. Cuthbert had a frank open coun tenance, bronzed by exposure, but legible as a book ; his eyes were a clear bright hazel, his hair was of a sort of tawny hue which has no name in the dyer's vocabulary, and his whiskers (a little lighter) obstinately refusing to grow in a continuous line, presented a couple of patchy bushes on the nether jaw. lie was by no means an ill-looking fellow, though he had patchy whiskers, a mouth k2"], [144, "132 STUNG TO THE QUICK. which always gave a glimpse of the clear white teeth within, and a nose which belonged to no one established type ; for if the lips were open and somewhat irresolute, the whole face beamed with good nature and generosity. So likewise did his father's, but the round good-tempered face was set in a thick bush of white hair, \u2014 \" mutton chop whiskers \" meeting and hiding within the voluminous folds of a white neckcloth (a trifle smaller than a sheet) tied in some mysterious fashion without a visible bow or knot. The neatly plaited French-cambric shirt-frills of which he seemed at once so proud and careful, were fastened down with an oval brooch containing his first wife's hair within a border of pearls set in red gold. His bottle-green coat with its gilt buttons, his buff Marseilles-quilting waistcoat, nankeen continuations, broad watch ribbon and bunch of seals, all told that he clung to the dress of the days when he was a beau and in his prime. Besides being ten years younger than his"], [145, "A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. 133 old friend, Mr. Marsh measured quite those many inches less in the waist, but as a sort of compensation he had risen three or four inches nearer to the ceiling. His face was quite as pleasant, with as cheerful good humour, but serene and ' equable ; whereas Mr. Hesketh's was liable to grow red and angry on what Mr. Marsh would have thought very slight provocation. Mr. Marsh, more over, formed a still greater contrast to the other, being dressed in deep mourning ; for even his black mohair stock had a falling front, barely relieved by a satin frill. The only touch of white about him was his collar, and that stood up stiffly on either side his face as if to keep his overflowing whiskers in order. Mr. Raeburn as yet has no fixed place in our picture, but he had one in the group, not so much by Eva's side as behind her in the back-ground, occupying a corresponding posi tion to that of Rhoda on the opposite side of the window ; the stout body of Mr. Hesketh partially hiding him from Rhoda's view, as every now and then the old gentleman leaned"], [146, "134 STUNG TO THE QUICK.' forward to make a passing remark to his god child. Does any young lady desire to know how- Mr. Raeburn, the beau-ideal of half the Durham demoiselles, was attired, let her consult uncle or papa, and it is probable she will hear that his faultlessly-cut swallow tailed coat of claret-coloured cloth was short in the waist, had a rather broad lapel collar, and sleeves so closely fitting as to require buttons for three or four inches above the wrist. That the said coat buttons, including two at the waist behind, were richly gilt and chased. That his vest was of claret velvet, a degree lighter than the coat ; his trousers of drab kerseymere, also closely fitting and strapped down tightly under glossy Wellington boots. That his collar stood erect like Mr. Marsh's, and his full black satin scarf was secured with a double breast-pin connected by a tiny chain. Such was Mr. Raeburn's exterior as he appeared in South Street, that summer evening, quite as interesting, quite as attractive,"], [147, "A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. 135 quite as gentlemanlike as any of our present loose-habited black-coated generation. But, then, Mr. Raeburn stood five feet ten in his stockings, had a face a sculptor might have modelled (for a thinking man, not an inane wax wig-block), lips with a bow-like curve, full and round and red as a woman's, yet redeemed from effeminacy by the decision and reticence which held them close. A thin line of black moustache fringed his upper lip, closely cut whiskers almost met beneath his rounded chin, a luxuriant crop of glossy curls clustered on his forehead, which had been toned down from its pristine white ness by the tropical sun under which he had been reared, and he carried himself with the grace of a gentleman, \u2014 not a dancing-master. Rhoda was by no means the only young lady in Durham who had set her heart upou Mr. Raeburn ; but she was the only one who felt, him to be attainable ; not that she valued him less, but that she valued herself more ; felt herself in fact the only person in the locality (for which she had a profound con-"], [148, "136 STUNG TO THE QUICK. tempt) who could at all stand on a par with him, and therefore the more especially fitted to attract his eye and win his affection. No fear of her simple cousin crossed her mind ; she was rather pleased than otherwise, when Mr. Raeburn retired from her view behind Eva and Mr. Hesketh. With his clear dark eye upon her, flirtation would not be the very easiest thing in the world, however adroit she might be, and she had somehow arrived at the conclusion, that he would not be easy to deceive with his eyes open. Eva, however, not dreaming of conquests or flirtations, laughed and chatted away whilst she threaded her needles and fastened her ends of wool \u2014 \" making love,\" as she called it, to her \" dear old god-papa ; \" every now and then giving a pleasant word to the younger listener, who, be it known, was not over delighted when the window was closed, the lamp brought in, and conversation became general. True, the engrossing rug-work which had"], [149, "A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. 137 kept the bright head and arch smile so per tinaciously bent over the canvas, and from himself, was laid aside, but, then, the merry face turned towards all alike, and no friendly curtain enabled him to whisper those occa sional sentences which elicit character, and may mean much or little, as they are inter preted. Not that Mr. Raeburn looked as if he were in love, or acted as if he were in love, but he had a dim consciousness that he would have been satisfied to remain in that shady nook, and did not care to be disturbed. Cuthbert had induced Miss Wearbank, with apparent reluctance, to promise him her crimson purse on its completion ; little think ing she was weaving another net for him, with a mesh closer and stronger, though invisible, and that the one he saw was but a type of that which he did not see.

Rhoda alone, never very voluble, somewhat less talkative than usual, made her eyes do the work for her tongue ; she had a difficult game to play, and cared not to show spectators her cards. One thing is certain, that Cuth bert's love for poor Mary was being thrust farther and deeper into the shade, by his growing passion for this strange enchantress, whose fascinations the unsuspicious, sus ceptible (and somewhat weak-headed) sailor found himself unable to resist. And so it turned out that when the friendly party broke up at a late hour, one at least went home in a state of mental intoxication, from which recovery was doubtful."], [151, "CHAPTER XL CAN THIS BE LOVE? The next morning Cuthbert found himself again in Mr. Marsh's snug parlour, drawn thither by a secret influence, which not all his sophistry could reconcile to his conscience it was right and proper to yield to. Mary had been the sweetheart of his boyhood ; to her pitying ear he had confided his sorrow for the loss of his mother, his grief and troubles when the fresh wife, overcoming his father's faint scruples, drove the lad she disliked to sea. It was Mary whose sympathy was ever ready when, after each voyage, he had a story to tell of ill-usage by a harsh captain and a brutal mate ; it was she who strengthened and sup ported him in his trials, and encouraged him"], [152, "140 STUNG TO THE QUICK. to endure, persevere, and overcome evil with good. She had been the light of his life, and loved him, he knew, with perfect, enduring love. Was he to renounce the faith of years for a bright eye and a witching voice ? Ah, there lay the secret ! It was witching, and though his conscience smote him, and though he resolved, on his return to Sunderland, he would make his peace with Mary, and while in Durham keep a strict watch over his heart, he, like many a fool besides him, presumed to trifle with temptation, and his fine resolves melted like mist before the sun of Rhoda's smile. Eva was busied with some culinary mystery when he came, so, running into the room with floury hands, she gave him one finger to shake, and telling him he \" must fain be satisfied with Rhoda's society that morning,\" ran back into the kitchen to resume her operations. Nothing could have been more favourable for Rhoda's plans, nothing more unfortunate"], [153, "CAN THIS BE LOVE ? 141 for Cuthbert's wise resolutions. Alas, for good intentions ! Pandemonium is indeed paved with them, and there is little fear of the pavement wearing away for lack of fresh material. Rhoda \" feared she should supply her cousin's place but indifferently, she was so little used to entertain strangers,\" saying it with the most winning assumption of artless simplicity imaginable. What could Cuthbert say? Was not a compliment forced from him 1 What did he say ? He hardly was conscious what \u2014 some thing he uttered about \" desiring no other society, her power to please exceeding that of all women he had met in any land:\" and when she smilingly, with downcast eyes, rebuked him for flattery, what could he do but protest his truthfulness ? And then, as she held her beautiful head down, as if too overpowered by his words to utter a reply, need we be surprised that his arm stole round her waist, and, forgetting Mary, he sur rendered himself to the infatuation of the"], [154, "142 STUNG TO THE QUICK. moment, and poured into her delighted ear a confession of passionate love. And he meant it. The poor moth was scorching his wings with a very dangerous flame, but he was helplessly, hopelessly fasci nated. But did Rhoda admit a corresponding feeling ? Oh, no ! tthe young lady was far too wary for that. She implied the possibility of being won to love him at some remote period, irresolutely urged her youth, her inexperience, her uncle's probable displeasure, but looked \u2014 oh, how she looked ! \u2014 as if love strove with bashful ness, and only maiden modesty sealed the too ready lips. But she never named Mary \u2014 never put in the plea of his engagement as a reason for rejecting his suit. She knew his love for her was of sudden, fungus growth, that for Mary deep-rooted as a forest-tree ; and, though her breath had withered the leaves, she feared lest an incautious reminder should cause the yet living branches to put forth fresh ones."], [155, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 143 Eva's pastry made, she joined the pair, and Rhoda escaped to her own room, under the pretext of preparing for a stroll by the river ; but, in reality, to hide and overcome her too visible exultation in the success of her arts. The stroll by the river was deferred, at Eva's suggestion, until after dinner, for she insisted that, \" after being half-roasted by the kitchen fire, it was not fair to ask her to walk out under a broiling sun ! \" \" Lest your goose should be cooked before Michaelmas, eh ? \" added Mr. Marsh, who had overheard her as he came in. \"Well, Cuthbert, my boy, how are you? Stay and have dinner with us. How soon will it be ready ? \" continued he, addressing Cuthbert and Eva in turn. \" Nancy is dishing it up ; Bella has laid the cloth. Yes, Cuthbert, you must stay ! You're not wanted at home, and you are wanted here ; you must stay and tell me how you like my pastry. I have been head cook to-day, papa,\" said Eva."], [156, "144 STUNG TO THE QUICK. So Cuthbert remained ; and after dinner, while Mr. Marsh had his pipe and his cus tomary \" forty winks,\" the trio strolled down the path to the waterside \u2014 the very path up which Rhoda had been carried wailing nearly nineteen years before. On proceeding a short distance they met Mr. Raeburn, who offered to accompany them, and as Cuthbert evinced no disposition to relinquish Rhoda, Eva, of course, paired off with the former, little to Rhoda's satis faction, it must be owned ; but Eva, it must equally be acknowledged, was perfectly satis fied with the arrangement, though as yet she was too blind to know wherefore. It was a delightful ramble, that by the cool river side, under the over-arching trees, that sultry summer day ; and to Eva the sky never seemed so bright, the water so clear, or the leaves so green \u2014 there was sunshine in her heart, and it brightened everything. Somehow, though, the little rattlepate was unusually silent, and even Mr. Raeburn appeared less fluent than ordinary. Eva"], [157, "CAN THIS BE LOVE ? 145 became apprehensive lest he would have pre ferred Rhoda as a companion ; and, strange to say, Mr. Raeburn was asking himself if Eva's thoughts were not with Cuthbert. The longer the silence continued, the more embarrassing it became. At length it was broken by a common-place observation of the gentleman's, but after a few minutes' conver sation, they relapsed into silence again. In a fit of desperation, Eva, as they reached a bend of the river, called Mr. Raeburn's attention to the extreme beauty of the scenery, and this elicited not only a response, but a very eloquent and vivid description of the lands he had lived in or passed through. Eva, deeply interested, forgot her fears, and everything but the happiness of listening to the rich tones of the speaker, into whose face she looked the pleasure she felt. Then he told her how his father and uncle had loved the same lady, and had quarrelled in consequence ; that years after their mar riage his father discovered she had been coerced by parental authority to marry him, VOL. I. L"], [158, "146 STUNG TO THE QUICK. her heart being bound to his brother. On hearing this he became furious with jealousy, burst into the chamber of his wife (always an invalid) in a fit of ungovernable rage, accused her of treachery, insinuated doubts of her fidelity, and by his language and de meanor so agitated her that she broke a blood-vessel and died within the week. Like many other angry men, he repented when too late \u2014 his jealousy was but the scum of his intense love. His agony at her loss was intense. England became hateful to him ; he placed his property in the hands of an agent, and taking with him his only son, Frank, then ten years old, wandered from land to land, in quest of the peace he never found, until he died in Antigua, six years before, repentant and hopeful. Thence he had him self been summoned by his late uncle's executors. \" At first,\" he said, \" I thought of returning to Antigua, leaving the manage ment of my newly-acquired estate in the hands of Mr. Hesketh, but an unforeseen circumstance over which I have no control"], [159, "CAN THIS BE LOVE ? 147 binds me now to my native land, and nothing but the disappointment of my fondest hopes will drive me hence again.\" Did Eva's imagination deceive her, or did his voice really seem tremulous with emotion, as he bent towards her to say this ? And why did little Eva's heart beat and flutter so wildly, as though winged with newly-fledged hopes ? and why did she avert her head, afraid to meet his searching gaze ? Ah ! why, indeed ? \u2014 was she learning so early the lesson we all learn once in life, and some learn once too often ? Cuthbert and Rhoda were in advance, not withstanding several attempts of the latter to drop into the rear, so that Rhoda saw neither the drooping head of Eva, nor the absorbed and earnest manner of Frank Raeburn. And well for them she did not, for she loved him with all the intensity of her pas sionate nature ; and woe betide the one who came between her and her aims, whatever they might be. As it was, she felt somewhat annoyed that Eva should be the companion of L 2"], [160, "148 STUNG TO THE QUICK. his walk ; but as this had been a matter of chance, not selection, and she herself had a profound contempt for her unsophisticated cousin, it never occurred to her that what she considered a blemish, some short (or far) sighted individual might regard as an excel lence. So she abandoned herself to the task of securing Cuthbert, whose return to his vessel was fixed for the following morning, and she succeeded beyond her expectations. Cuthbert Hesketh's acquaintance with the opposite sex was very limited, as might be expected in one shipped off for sea so soon ; and moreover, his impressions of women in general were not over favourable. He carried away with him no kindly home recollections ; his step-mother and half-sister having fur nished him with very discouraging samples of female grace and manner. He had wandered from clime to clime, from port to port, but, with few exceptions, his acquaintance with woman had, sailor-like, been confined to the free-and-easy class indigenous to all sea-port towns in England or elsewhere. Now and"], [161, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 149 then Captain Hesketh might find himself in the presence of wife and daughter of some foreign merchant, where difference of language rendered intercourse imperfect ; or an invita tion to the drawing-room of some home skipper might introduce him to the graceful and refined of the household, but these oppor tunities were rare, and Mary Reed had been to him at once the concentration of all feminine excellences and his ideal of perfect womanhood. Had he met Rhoda in the fashionable saloon of a merchant prince, he would most probably have regarded her as one of the twinkling stars of an inapproachable firma ment, his own awkwardness and embarrass ment widening the distance ; but she came upon him where he was most at home, to dazzle him by her loveliness, and captivate by a refinement of manner and conversation contrasting vividly with all around and about her. He was near enough to feel her in fluence, to come unguarded within the range of her blandishments ; and Mary's gentle manners, her homely face, every-day accom-"], [162, "150 STUNG TO THE QUICK. plishments, and unobtrusive virtues paled to insignificance. The glorious sun put out the common fire, and left him dazed aud be wildered. And so, wandering with her upon his arm, listening to the witchery of her voice, he surrendered himself to the intoxication of the hour, forgetful of everything but the syren by his side, whose well-feigned diffidence but made him more eager and impetuous, more thoroughly enraptured when her lingering and indefinite consent to his suit fell falter ingly from seemingly reluctant lips. One thing, however, she gave him clearly to understand \u2014 that in the presence of others he must neither exhibit nor expect any marks of sentiment beyond friendship. And regard ing this but as a proof of innate and excessive delicacy, Cuthbert was in the seventh heaven, and would have promised anything those sweet lips asked him. Busied with the arts which were to convert Mary Reed's betrothed into her sworn thrall, Rhoda surrendered Mr. Raeburn to Eva for"], [163, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 151 the afternoon, not without momentary hesi tation certainly, but with no fear for the result. Accustomed to mould plastic minds to her will, and supremely confident in her own powers, she imagined her smiles would bring any man to her feet, and that he would prove no exception. So she walked by Cuth bert's side with the flush of success on her cheek, and triumph in her step and bearing, whilst he was enchanted alike by the stateli ness which awed, and the flush which assured him. Mr. Raeburn, however, was neither so plastic nor so simple as Rhoda thought. He had travelled much, not as Cuthbert, a rough seaman among rougher seamen \u2014 but as a gentleman, the son of a gentlemau, whose ample means, education, aud well-bred ease, qualified him to move in the first society, not only in Antigua, but at home. The gloom thrown over his young life by the circumstances attending his mother's un timely end, and his father's remorseful moods, had made him thoughtful and reflective even"], [164, "152 STUNG TO THE QUICK. as a boy. Strangers deemed him cold, equable, unimpressionable : he was simply self-contained. There was fire in his heart, but he kept it under cover, and only a gentle warmth lit up his face in friendly intercourse. Rhoda had no plummet to sound the depths of his nature, nor a charm which was new to him. He had withstood the battery of bright eyes, the witchery of sweet smiles, the cajolery of winning words, long before he came within range of her seductive glances, and his cour teous attention to her during the journey from London to Durham was not (as she supposed) the result of magnetic attraction, but the politeness of a gentle nature towards a young and apparently inexperienced girl travelling a long distance without companion or protector. He had dwelt among dark-eyed, queenly beauties so long, that Eva's flaxen hair and bright\" blue eyes attracted him from their very rarity, whilst the frank and artless gaiety of her manner completed the charm. But if he were in love, Frank Raeburn had"], [165, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 153 mastered the art of concealing it from in different beholders, and if he narrated his life-story to Eva during that pleasant stroll, to watch her varying countenance and test the strength of her feelings, he certainly betrayed nothing prematurely beyond the vague allusion to the circumstance \" which bound him to England,\" and the tone which told it. To him, Eva's varying face was as an open book, and he read there \u2014 not dis couragement. Thus it was that the whole party declared on their return to South Street that the ramble had \" been delightful ; \" though cer tainly three out of the four had walked on in utter oblivion of surrounding objects. The evening was of course spent at Mr. Marsh's, Mr. Hesketh and Dr. Grove drop ping in after tea to smoke a friendly pipe with the old gentleman, and test the quality of some fine old ale he had just received from the Sedgefield Brewery. Mrs. Hesketh resolutely resisted the intro duction of tobacco into her precise and stylish"], [166, "154 STUNG TO THE QUICK. parlours, which it was her boast to keep always prepared to receive ladies ; conse quently, when Mr. Hesketh desired the solace of a pipe, he was compelled to retreat to the kitchen (in the north, not a comfortless haven, by the bye), to the exclusive bar-parlour of the Waterloo, or the house of Mr. Marsh. There he was always sure of a hearty wel come and a merry little maiden to fill his pipe, hand him a light, and pull his bushy whiskers, ere she vanished through the curling smoke. Dr. Grove laboured under no such diffi culty ; he had the faculty of managing matters to suit his own convenience, and had he desired to smoke in his chamber, would have done so, not that he did, but had he felt so inclined, would. True, he did consider Mrs. Grove's best curtains, and his own picture-frames, and so held aloof from the drawing-room, and he did consult Mrs. Grove's known preference for cigars occa sionally during that lady's lifetime, but he did it freely, not under compulsion ; and now"], [167, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 155 that he was a widower, he pursued the same course from habit. Rhoda often ' poohed ' and ' pahed ' at the smoke, and endeavoured to restrict the friends to cigars, but was out voted, Eva going over to the enemy at once ; so she was obliged to surrender, and content herself with quitting the room. Accordingly there was nothing surprising in her retiring from the parlour to the draw ing-room, when pipes were introduced that evening ; and no one suspected she wished to avoid the penetrating eyes of Dr. Grove \u2014 not even the worthy doctor himself. She was accompanied in her retreat by Eva, and speedily followed by Captain Hes keth and Mr. Raeburn, who professed to pre fer music to tobacco-smoke, though nothing was said of preference for the musicians. Left to themselves, amidst the clouds of smoke, the trio conceived a luminous idea; and, resigning at length their pipes, crossed the hall in a body to announce that a pic-nic to Finchale Abbey had been determined on, to come off in about three weeks, when Cap-"], [168, "156 STUNG TO THE QUICK tain Hesketh would be over, for a couple of days, to say good-bye to his father before he set sail for Oporto. That Mr. Raeburn would be at liberty was taken for granted. Eva was delighted, and Rhoda not the less, although her gratification was more tran quilly expressed. Then arose the question, who should be invited to join them ? And any one who has had the arranging of a gipsy party, knows how perplexing a question this is. Mr. Marsh thought Cuthbert's mother and sister should be asked. Cuthbert declared he did not care whom on earth they asked ex cepting Mrs. and Miss Hesketh ; and Rhoda protested quite as decidedly, if less vehe mently, that if they were invited she must decline to go. This the infatuated fool, igno rant of her rooted aversion and its cause, ascribed to her attachment, to himself. A second time Mr. Marsh blundered : de siring Cuthbert to bring Mary over to accom pany them. The bewildered recusant co loured violently, and stammered out some-"], [169, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 157 thing unintelligible, which unenlightened Mr. Marsh interpreted from his own heart to mean he would bring her if he could. Finally, it was agreed that any friends of the young ladies were to be enrolled, with the above-named exceptions ; Mr. Hesketh and Dr. Grove being jocosely appointed to assist Mr. Marsh in maintaining order among so many young people. Cuthbert, charged with a message to Mary Reed, which he tacitly consented to deliver (without any intention of doing so), then took leave, little at ease, having been adroitly baffled by Rhoda in a clumsy attempt to gain a few moments' pri vate conversation with her. Mr. Raeburn lingered to the last, gentle manlike and self-possessed ever, with nothing in look or tone to indicate more than a friendly interest in either young lady, nothing more than an almost impalpable pressure of Eva's hand as he shook it after Rhoda's."], [170, "CHAPTER XII. PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. Trivial and common matters in a small country town ever attain an importance, almost incomprehensible to the dweller in the metropolis, accustomed to the whirl and bustle of active life, and the crowding pano rama of great events ever rolling on before him. A pic-nic near London would be a pebble in a stream ; a pic-nic in Durham, projected, too, by an independent member of the community, was an affair of interest to scores whom it did not concern, and the first intimation of the intended fete sufficed to organise a sort of house to house visitation, of all the old maids and gossips in ordinary. Let not this be mistaken for a reflection on old maids in general ; the writer has especial"], [171, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 159 veneration for the much-maligned sisterhood, but Durham is proverbially celebrated for \" wood and water, law and gospel, old maids and mustard,\" and, as those unburdened with family cares of their own may be supposed to have a superfluity of leisure, it is only natural the spare half-hours should be dedicated to a supervision of the affairs of others, not arising in the first instance from a desire to do mis chief, but from a lack of useful occupation, and a yearning towards the interests and sym pathies from which they are personally shut out. No sooner, therefore, did it ooze out that the Marshes were preparing for a pic-nic, than old maids who had once been young ones, young maids who in all probability were destined to be old ones, matrons with mar riageable daughters, ay, and even here and there a sire with a son to settle in the world, began to speculate on the probable extent of the party, and assume invitations in all direc tions but the true ones. Not desirous to bring down a storm on his"], [172, "160 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" devoted head,\" Mr. Hesketh carefully ab stained from all mention at home of the pro jected pleasure-party, from which his wife and Lucy had been so carefully excluded ; but there were not wanting good-natured friends to put the twain in possession of all the facts and fictions current respecting it. One lady after another came and went with her budget of news ; whilst the knitted anti-macassars, discomposed by one bevy of visitors, were smoothed and replaced before the advent of another, and efforts were made to compose the still more ruffled tempers of the ladies visited. When Mrs. Hodgson uplifted her hands, \" surprised that Mrs. Hesketh knew nothing of the Marsh's pic-nic,\" and the Misses Cald cleugh \"presumed their dear friends would be of the party, since Mr. Hesketh was one of the chief movers,\" and the Forsters, and Ords, and Hardwicks, one and all sympathising with \" their excellent friend's peculiar posi tion, her outraged feelings,\" and shocked at \"the indignity offered to their sex in the"], [173, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 161 person of Mrs. Hesketh and her sweet daughter,\" brought all the little tid-bits of news they could collect for the delectation of the irritated pair, in order to \" convince them how shamefully they were treated by their natural protector,\" and what ill-used beings they were, it is not surprising that these assiduous (and wonderfully well-meaning) at tempts to soothe \" wounded feelings \" should produce a diametrically opposite result, and stir two very active temperaments to a ferment. The first ebullition of tears and temper having subsided, Mrs. Hesketh hurried to Gilesgate to pour all her sorrows and trials into the ample lap of her bosom friend, Mrs. Coulson, whom she was in the habit of con sulting in all the dark hours of her life, and they were many. Mrs. Coulson was a fat and jolly-looking widow, who had survived the ill-usage of three several spouses, and supplied experience and sympathy gratis to those miserable married ladies of her acquaintance who had VOL.

I should just like to take her pride down a peg or two, though she never did me any harm, to be sure.\" \" May be not, but it was through her that Lucy was almost turned out of Miss Robson's school, and for nothing but ' taking her pride down a peg,' as you say. / owe her no goodwill ; but Mr. Marsh thinks so much of his bargain, it is not safe to meddle with her,\" M 2"], [176, "164 STUNG TO THE QUICK. replied Mrs. Hesketh, remembering the threat of the Ecclesiastical Court with a suppressed shudder. \" But suppose we could manage to pay them back in their own coin \u2014 to annoy the hizzie's bairn who gives herself the airs of a duchess, and perplex this unfeeling husband of yours at the same time ?

The three weeks passed, as all time does, more rapidly than anticipated, when it is fully occupied. Cuthbert was busied with the \"Polly,\" her underwriters, crew, and cargo; Mr. Raeburn with matters concerning his new property \u2014 business which frequently"], [177, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 165 called him to London for weeks at a time, and on this occasion for a fortnight. Rhoda and Eva wrote a number of invita tions to friends at a distance, the former de claring that \" most of the people of Durham were such arrant mischief-makers and gossips, she did not care for their company.\" She did not say how sensitive her feelings were in mingling with those who might despise her for her origin, or that she hoped to shine with greater lustre the more of the country and less of the town element pre vailed. So Eva, after a feeble protest in favour of a few Durham favourites of her own, suc cumbed, and the notes were written, sealed, posted, and replied to in due course. Mr. Marsh, too, was in a wondrous bustle as the time drew near, providing, and with Martin's help packing, sundry mysterious hampers, the contents of which had kept Nancy and Bella running to and fro, from pantry to dresser, and dresser to oven, flushed and faint with heat, though with open doors"], [178, "166 STUNG TO THE QUICK. and windows, the immense fire almost roast ing the cook as well as the joints and poultry. The cousins, protesting that \" black crape bonnets were heavy,\" and their \"paramatta dresses unendurable,\" Eva coaxed the willing old gentleman to replenish their purses, with especial reference to white crape bon nets, challis dresses, and muslin pelerines. Then ensued a series of journeys to and from drapers, and milliners and dress-makers ; with such a trying on and fitting on as was surely never seen \u2014 except on just such another occasion, anywhere else. The important day came, and the expected guests assembled. Several arrived the pre vious evening, and beds were extemporised in all unsuspected nooks of the old-fashioned rambling house. Mary Reed, however, did not come, for the simple reason she had not been asked, Cuth bert declaring he \" forgot all about it,\" and begging Eva \" never to mind, as it couldn't be helped then.\" Eva did \" mind,\" for she loved her friend,"], [179, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 167 and knowing Mary's quiet and monotonous life, hoped to have given her a pleasant and beneficial change, and she was surprised not more at Cuthbert's forgetfulness than at his light and indifferent manner of treating the subject. Of course Rhoda was not surprised ; and if she \" minded,\" the word bore another sig nification to her. There were the Middletons from Sedge field ; the Teesdales from Trimdon ; the Forsters from Sacristan ; the Applegarths from Brancepeth ; but only the three Miss Adamsons and a stray bachelor or two from Durham itself. Clear and propitious shone the morn, when at a tolerably early hour the party began to assemble in Church Street, regardless of the hill. Many were the curious eyes peering from behind windows, many the little urchins astride the low wall, to watch the equipages arrive and depart ; and as hamper after hamper was brought out and strapped to the carriages, baskets too heavy for their handles"], [180, "168 STUNG TO THE QUICK. placed under the seats, ladies handed in, and their cavaliers seated beside them, various ex clamations of conjecture or astonishment were openly uttered, bursting into a loud \" hooray\" as the vehicles rolled away, to the satisfaction of all but the horses \u2014 and they would have preferred lighter roads. Off they went, down the hill and up again, along Framwellgate, and soon were bowling along the North Road,* laughing and chatting merrily, as people do when thoroughly bent on enjoying themselves. On they went, tak ing the old bye-road at Aycliffe, up hill and down dale, under the bluest of blue skies, the most fervid of summer suns ; on they went, and in due time arrived at Finchale, and un packed first the carriages, then the hampers. Sharp fellows were those monks of olden time, with a keen sense of the beautiful, whether in art or nature ; practical old fellows too, knowing as if by instinct where to erect their rookeries. Wood and water, hill and * The New North Road did not then exist."], [181, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 169 dale, rare pasturage and clear springs, were the essentials for the site of either abbey or monastery. There must be good promise of food, fire, and water, or they would none of it. Every monastery was not an Hospice of St. Bernard, nor every cowled brother a Monk of La Trappe ! Accordingly the instinctive wisdom of the founder of Finchale * had led to the selection of a deep and fertile vale, almost encircled by a bend of the river Wear, sheltered from the north winds by the lofty rocks and hanging woods of Cocken, and on every other side enclosed by steep hills. The river, broken here and there into beauty by its rocky bed, still flows swiftly by, curving round the level plot where Finchale Abbey stood, much as it sweeps round Durham Cathedral. But the former is a shattered and fragmentary ruin, in a fair, green valley, amid ancient woods ; the latter remains still a magnificent temple to the Most High, crowning with its massive Pronounced indifferently Finkale or Finkle."], [182, "170 STUNG TO THE QUICK. pillars, its antique towers, its heavy buttressed walls, a lofty hill surrounded by a city on other hills, which has erewhile been likened unto a \" map of Zion.\" The monks are gone from both, yet still the white-stoled chorister sings a Te Deum in the cathedral's ancient choir, and strangers with hushed steps and voices loiter in chancel, or Galilee, or cloister, to wonder and admire ; but through the broken arches of the cross-shaped abbey no anthem rings save the summer hymn of birds, or the wild winds of winter wailing o'er decay. Visitors come and go, but not to meditate or worship ; not with hushed voice and reverent step ; they come in groups to laugh, and sing, and feast and make merry, forgetful alike of the saint who founded, or the monks who feasted there. No rueful thoughts of the \" dead and gone\" occupants of the ruined abbey there fore disturbed the gleeful party presided over by Mr. Marsh, Mr. Hesketh, and Dr. Grove, who had announced they could manage the"], [183, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 171 matter to everybody's satisfaction without the interference of any meddling women, and, confident in their own capabilities, marshalled their followers to the refreshment-house (erected in the grounds for the convenience of such visitors), attended by Martin and his comrades hamper-laden. Mr. Marsh laughed, Mr. Hesketh swore, whilst Dr. Grove, biting his thumb-nail and half-closing his eyes, put on his studying cap, when the person in charge quietly informed them that the rooms had been engaged a fort night previously for a large and exclusive party. Any other little accommodation they might require (such as heating their kettles at tea time) they could have, but the rooms were not at liberty. For a few moments three blank faces gazed at the woman and at each other, broken at length by the expostulations of Mr. Hesketh, who, wiping his hot forehead with a handker chief scarcely redder than his face, preferred to \" refresh \" in the shade rather than in the sunshine."], [184, "172 STUNG TO THE QUICK.

Besides, a gipsy party loses half its character when the green sward is exchanged for a boarded floor, so let us adjourn to the shelter of the ruins without more ado.

He fled to avoid those quarrels which he shrank from, but which are ever the inevitable offspring of a choleric man and a narrow-minded aggra vating woman.

Thus it was that after venting his annoy ance in the given retort to Mrs. Hesketh, he hastened with Eva after their retreating party, and once out of sight of his domestic tyrant, banished the unpleasant subject from his mind as summarily as usual. Built, as usual, in the form of a cross, there had been in the centre of the church where the four limbs joined, a tower or spire erected on four massive circular pillars, so massive that one of them contained a turnpike stair case which led to the superstructure.

As there are four pillars, you may shelter from the sun whatever quarter he shines from, or you may have a nap in that staircase, which we are converting into a wine-cooler. Hang the rooms, say I, we must have paid cash down for them, and I am told we can take the turnpike upon trust.\" Mr. Hesketh, who was deeply interested in the negociation of sundry turnpike trusts, laughed at this sally, turned up his cuffs, and came forward to assist the search then going on for a corkscrew. Not more than half the glasses were broken, and no wine was spilled, but cork screws had been forgotten. \" I have one,\" exclaimed Edwin Grove (the doctor's son and heir), at the same time pro ducing one of those multum-in-parvo pocket knives which always promise so much and generally perform so little. He had been deluded into the purchase of the implement by a crafty itinerant representing himself \" a Sheffield cutler out of work,\" his charity"], [191, "FOR A MERE SONG. 179 being stimulated by a knowledge of the ap proaching trip. The wine was old, the cork rebellious, and snap went the gimcrack corkscrew the first pull. However, bottle-necks are not made of adamant, so the omissions and acci dents were alike of little importance ; and the thirsty travellers having refreshed, sepa rated into parties or pairs to wander among the trees, or to explore the ancient ruins. Rhoda, to Cuthbert's chagrin, very adroitly set him aside, in order to attach herself to Mr. Raeburn as guide during his explorations, he being strange to the spot, she familiar with it from childhood. Very fascinating she Avas, very beautiful in her white crape bonnet, very ladylike ; and did the honours of the ruins so elaborately, yet so unpretendingly, and with such beseeching tenderness of tone and manner, though modest withal, that Frank needed some amulet to preserve him from her allurements.

Mr. Hesketh, who had a leaning towards a favourite key-bugle, had brought it with him, and employed the instrument as a signal to summon the wanderers to dinner, which he and Martin had laid out on the whitest of white table-cloths, spread on the greenest of grass. Soon the stragglers made their ap pearance, and seated themselves gipsy fashion ; plates clattered, knives and forks rattled, bottles were decapitated, pie-crusts crumbled like fortresses in a siege, ham and tongues"], [194, "182 STUNG TO THE QUICK. were carved, and chickens dissected by Doctor Grove (appointed head carver by Mr. Marsh as a sort of practical joke), and the great business of dining proceeded amidst mirth and laughter. Cuthbert had contrived to steal round to Rhoda's side, and thereupon she afforded him a few of her pleasant smiles to make digestion easy. Frank Raeburn devoted himself to no one lady in particular, though he was careful Eva lacked nothing he could procure for her. Edwin Grove, with his coat turned inside out as a livery, professed himself waiter in ordinary, and desired Martin to remember that for that occasion he (Martin) was butler only, and so must not interfere with his duties as general attendant. Martin nodded slily and cunningly as he replied, \" Thank yo, Maister Ed'n, aw expect a guid day's darg* wi'out medlin' wi' rnair than aw can manage cannily.

Her requests were made known, her thanks expressed with so winning a grace, the young aspirant for medical honours was captivated at once, and became most assiduous in his attendance, to the palpable neglect of his duties elsewhere. Dr. Grove was not so occupied with his anatomical pursuits as to be unobservant of what passed around him, and, without appa rent motive, quickly summoned the \" waiter \" from so dangerous a neighbourhood, and pro vided him with ample employment elsewhere. Still, he made occasions for speech with the gracious belle, whom he remembered but as * Thirst."], [196, "184 STUNG TO THE QUICK. an imperious school-girl, only remarkable for very black eyes, very black hair, and a pro found contempt for boys. He had heard of her, it is true, but not in very flattering terms ; and, being prepared to meet an arro gant dame, too scornful and self-sufficient to be attractive, he was more than agreeably surprised. He was disposed to attribute envy to his informant, and where he found unexpected beauty and suavity to ascribe also every grace and virtue which should be beauty's dower. So he lingered near her, and when the waiter himself found leisure to dine, carried his plate with him, and seated himself near the universal charmer, much to the disgust of Cuthbert, who did not care to have a pleasant tete-a-tete interrupted. Setting aside the gratification of Rhoda's vanity, and love of power, she hailed Edwin Grove's approach as serving to abate the exclusive appearance of Cuthbert's devotion, afraid lest Mr. Raeburn should observe, credit her with flirtation, and resign all pretensions"], [197, "185 FOR A MERE SONG. to her himself. She had no desire to lose the substance for the shadow, and therefore skilfully avoided any display of particular preference. After dinner there were fresh rambles, then an assemblage for singing. Edwin Grove produced a flute, on which he was by no means a bad player, and then, sultry as the day had been, dancing was proposed, when key-bugle and flute were both called into requisition. Again Rhoda contrived to monopolize Mr. Raeburn, but Eva had insisted that Dr. Grove should dance and be her partner, and they were vis-a-vis. Cuthbert and Miss Middle ton, Mr. Marsh and Miss Applegarth made up one set. Rhoda, as graceful a dancer as she was an accomplished musician, moved over the grass as elegantly as on a ball-room floor, dispensing smiles and sweet words to all the gentlemen in turn \u2014 reserving her blandest for Cuthbert, her truest for Frank. She had brought a sketch-book with her, and strolled away to pencil some delightful"], [198, "186 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" bits \" of scenery ; not that she cared to exercise her skill as an artist, but she had a vague hope Mr. Raeburn would follow her. He did not, but Cuthbert did ; and she rebuked him sharply for making his atten tions so conspicuous. Somewhat crestfallen he retired, resolved to make himself agree able to Eva, but he found her listening with sparkling eyes to something Frank Raeburn had spoken for her especial ear. Up to this period, with the single exception of the morning surprise, all had gone \" merry as a marriage bell ; \" and Mr. Marsh, grati fied by the pleasure of others, was quite in his element. Stray groups of the rival par ties had met in their rambles, but they passed and re-passed unmarked, from the fact that the Marsh party was principally composed of strangers to Durham and its denizens. Mr. Hesketh had taken an early oppor tunity to whisper his friend Marsh his fears lest some unpleasantness might occur, the body of visitors who had so quietly sup planted themselves being his wife and her"], [199, "187 FOR A MERE SONG. friends, half the gossips and mischief-makers of Durham. Mr. Marsh only laughed, and declaring it a capital joke, an act of skilful generalship, proposed that a flag of truce should be sent into the enemy's camp, to suggest an imme diate amalgamation of their respective forces \u2014 a proposal the discomfited husband nega tived at once, as sure to cause a revolt amongst their own immediate followers ; and nothing more was said of amalgamation. When hour after hour went by without interference or intrusion, Mr. Hesketh began to hope he had been mistaken in his wife's motive and manner, and that the rencontre was the result of accident : a delusion dis agreeably dispelled before the day departed. After her summary dismissal of Cuthbert, Rhoda continued her solitary walk a short distance ; then seating herself on an old grey stone coated with moss and lichens, arranged her few materials, and began to sketch the view of river and ruin spread out before her. She had occupied the same seat years"], [200, "188 STUNG TO THE QUICK. before in moody reverie, when Mr. Marsh drove her, a convalescent patient, over to Finchale occasionally for change of air and scene, and she turned to the well known spot naturally, without a thought that the dining-house was separated from her retreat only by a few straggling trees. She pencilled her outlines with a firm bold hand, casting frequent and anxious glances outwards in hope to see Mr. Raeburn advance in quest of her ; a bolder stroke of her pencil than ordinary, a more rugged touch given to rock or ruin alone betraying her impatience and disappointment. \" A masterly touch that,\" uttered by a voice above, caused her to look upward. Mr. Edwin Grove was bending towards her, glass in eye, watching the progress of her drawing very complacently. \" How you startled me ! I thought I was alone ! \" exclaimed she, closing the book and rising instantly. \" Is Miss Wearbank so little acquainted with the power of her own charms as to"], [201, "FOR A MERE SONG. 189 suppose she can absent herself from her friends without being missed ? \" said the gentleman, deferentially. \" Miss Wearbank never gave the matter a moment's consideration,\" replied she, with a slight shrug of the shoulders, gathering up her pencils as she continued, \" I had promised a drawing to a friend, and thought this a favourable opportunity to redeem my word.\" \" Do not suffer me to be the cause of your friend's disappointment, I beg. Pray resume your seat and occupation. I shall be proud to remain in attendance as your pencil-bearer. Your humble servant a second time to-day.\" A little hesitancy, a few more words of entreaty, and Miss Wearbank complied with the request so gallantly urged. \" Have you any recollection, Miss Wear bank, of the great rough schoolboy who used to pelt Miss Marsh and yourself with snow balls so unmercifully all the way from the Bailey to your own door ?

Have you a pardon now for the rude fellow who tormented you then ? \" \" As my memory does not go back so far to either schooldays or schoolboys, I presume pardon to be unnecessary,\" replied she, look ing up with a bland smile which belied the bitter memories crowding round her heart and strengthened by his words. Just then, as if to intensify her pain, from the open windows behind the trees came rolling forth, distinct and clear as a good and powerful singer could give it, a rollicking song with a semi-pathetic refrain, which was caught up as a chorus by all the male voices, more than one feminine tone blending with the rest. The song told ludicrously the story of a poor little lambkin dropped on the banks of the Wear, rescued and petted to please a spoiled child, but which growing bigger, more sheepish, and more troublesome as time went by, was finally resigned to the butcher and cook. The burden with each stanza"], [203, "FOR A MERE SONG. 191 marked a gradation of the story, varying from A poor little lambkin, a waif of the Wear,\" to The last of their lambkin, the waif of the Wear. The song arrested Rhoda's attention, her pencil dropped, she listened with lips apart and eyeballs fixed, powerless to move. Her own story was caricatured from the beginning, and the end \u2014 it told her what she might expect when her friends were weary of her. She clenched her hand and ground her teeth in a futile attempt to disguise her outraged feelings and subdue her emotion : Edwin Grove, standing by in extreme per plexity, comprehending each coarse allusion, yet afraid to wound a sensitive mind still more by any open recognition of the insult. But they were not the only hearers, Cuth bert, hovering near the region his enslaver occupied, passed under the windows and applauded loudly what he called a \"capital song,\" in blissful ignorance of its hidden"], [204, "192 STUNG TO THE QUICK. meaning ; for as he was seldom at home, and when there \"never listened to women's yarns,\" all he knew of Rhoda's parentage was, that some mystery attached to it. A posse of their companions, with Mr. Hesketh and Mr. Marsh in their midst, de sirous to have a game at threadneedle or forfeits before tea, had come in search of the three absentees, and choosing different paths reached the vicinity of the building in time to hear more or less of the song. \" A capital song, you scoundrel ! what do you mean ? It is an infamous song, a das tardly attack on a defenceless girl. But I'll know the author of it. Move out of the way ! As he spoke, old Mr. Hesketh, fuming with indignation, brushed past his bewildered son, thrust aside the housekeeper who blocked the doorway, and darted into the midst of his wife's gleeful party, with no very clear notion what he was about to do. Cuthbert, however, foreseeing a \" squall,\" and knowing there were \" breakers a-head \""], [205, "193 FOR A MERE SONG. (as he afterwards owned), plunged after his father as soon as he had recovered from his own astonishment. Then ensued an uproar which baffles de scription. Mrs. Hesketh, with curling lip and ex ultant eye, met her husband almost on the threshold, and bade him return to the party he came with ; her friends did not require his society. Spluttering with passion, he confronted her much more boldly than his wont. \" Your friends, indeed, madam ! Thank God they are not mine ! I demand to know who sung that song ? \" and he looked resolutely around the room. \" Perhaps the gentleman, whom I have not the honour of knowing, will favour us with the title of the song he refers to.

I own Jack Fortescue did sing it, and moreover Jack Fortescue wrote it ! But what if I did ?

Mrs. Coulson and Mrs. Hesketh had been the spurs in the sides of their poet's Pegasus ; not Lucy, she was only a consenting party ; and while Mr. Fortescue was flattered and cajoled, installed into office as comptroller of their projected excursion, kept (as was very common with him) in a state of constant exhilaration with good wine, and primed to write or do anything they asked, Lucy re mained wisely in the back-ground. But she had sat at the open window while he sang, a window overlooking Rhoda's seat, and with grim satisfaction noted the result. She saw that the shaft had gone home, and re joiced the more because she beheld Edwin Grove, her own admirer, bending over her old rival ; doubly her rival now. So when Edwin (whose surprise at seeing her in the room may be guessed) assumed a lover's right to disapprove her share in the mean plot against another woman's peace, she denied being an accessory, most strenu ously; and to his rebuke for being in such society without his protection, retorted very"], [210, "198 STUNG TO THE QUICK. readily and pertinently, armed with the evidence of her own eyes.

Not so hot-headed as Mr. Hesketh, Mr. Marsh, instead of hastening forward to swell the number of disputants, and give an idle but malicious song undue importance, led Rhoda away, treated the matter lightly for her sake, and bade her dismiss the whole from her mind as unworthy her notice.

Eva's radiant countenance, turned towards Mr. Raeburn, caused her a pang second only to the torture inflicted by the luckless song. Still she came forward with accustomed ease, smiling as though nothing had occurred to ruffle her, and affably pronounced herself willing to join in any game decided on by the majority.

Nor did any idea of a want of fitness in their positions glance over the minds of either herself or her father. The reins of government had fallen so naturally into the hands of Rhoda during their great bereavement, when the rest of the household were abandoned to grief, she looked so much older than Eva, so much more fitted to command, and the latter had so little jealousy or love of power in her composition, she ceded her right to Rhoda tacitly, without any suspicion that she made a concession.

But there was no solitude for her that night ; the crowded state of the house pre cluded it. Spare beds, and extra beds in such rooms as would hold them, were all doubly occupied, and she must hide her miserv as best she might. There are women, however, who have nerve for anything, and Rhoda was one of these. She did the honours of the table faultlessly, and later in the evening laughed, danced, played, and sang as unfalteringly as any lady present.

She remembered having heard him object long before to waltzing, citing Lord Byron's \" Ode to Waltz\" in justification of his sentiments, and so took care in his hearing to refuse more than one partner, declining to waltz or polk on principle. She cleverly contrived to interpose artificial barriers between him and Eva, and managed unsuspectedly to lure him to her side, and keep him there under the dangerous fascina tion of an eye love-lit and a voice intoned with intense feeling.

To heal a wound in her heart she courted flattery, more than to feed her vanity, but he saw only the latter, and turned from the glare of her beauty to merry little Eva, whom he would not have dared to insult with a flattering word. The party did not break up till long after midnight, the three Miss Adamsons being escorted to the North Bailey by a bodyguard comprising the two Heskeths, Mr. Raeburn, and a couple of stray bachelors who were neighbours. Brothers, sisters, and sweethearts separated for the night ; shake-downs were arranged on sofas and chairs, laughing girls huddled together in their chambers in most un studied dishabille to discuss the events of the day, compare notes, and rally each other on conquests, real or imaginary, during the brushing and combing process known as \" doing the hair.\""], [225, "ECHOES OF THE SONG. 213 But even girlish chatter must cease some time, and one by one the noises in the house subsided into silence.

Rhoda, however, retired to rest mad with suppressed rage at the insult so wantonly offered to her, and with all concerned therein \u2014 with Mrs. Hesketh, as the prime mover, she was furious, and mentally vowed revenge ; with Mr. Hesketh she was enraged for a championship which only made her more conspicuous, and the stigma in the song indelible.

He was most attentive, most gentlemanlike, most obliging, but there was no tenderness in his tone. He never made opportunities to be near her, alone with her. Yet why, if he did not love her, was he so constant a visitor at their house ? Surely Eva's baby face did not draw him thither ! The thought smote her like a sword, but she would not harbour the suspicion. His manner to both was so equal ; perhaps his heart was yet free ; and if so she would win him in spite of fate.

He had looked love if he had not spoken it ; but then was he not away with Rhoda for an hour ? Did they not dance together ? Might not his manner be as soft and tender to Rhoda ? It was very dreadful to think so ; but then Rhoda was so fascinating, so accom plished, so beautiful. She could not be sur prised if he did love her best : and yet she did not think his eyes were false \u2014 but she would watch, and if he did love her cousin best, then she would tear the love from her own heart if it killed her ; and the poor child sobbed herself to sleep after that pleasant pic-nic party.

In no pleasant mood the girl hastily settled the refractory kettle, and hurried to the door, wondering all the time she unfastened lock and bolt who could be there to disturb people at that hour in the morning. By the time the last bolt was unfastened, Martin, in his stocking feet, with his corduroy breeches un buttoned at the knees, and one arm only thrust into his red worsted plush waistcoat, was at her elbow, aroused by the unwonted summons. Holding by the door-post, and balancing himself on the step, was Jack Fortescue, in a state of more than semi-intoxication. Bella opened her mouth wide with amaze ment, and made an angry movement as if she would have shut the door in his face for a drunken vagabond who had no business there, but he dropped his left hand to the knob, and held it open while he stuttered out \u2014"], [234, "222 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" Is Mr. M-m-rnarsh at home ? a-wan-a- 11 see-m. \" Maister's nut oop, Maister Fortusku, he canna see you,\" replied Martin. \" Wan-a-see Miss-r Mar-sh ? wan-a-see Miss-r Ma-arsh?\" \" Dinneh you year Maister's nut oop ? you mun call some ither tyem,\" thrust in Bella, still holding fast the door, lest he should gain admittance. \"Mus see Mis-r Ma-arsh,\" persisted the scapegrace, \" wan t' pol-a-gise, wan t' pol-o gise; come in an' w-w-wait ; \" so saying he pushed himself head-foremost into the hall, to Bella's indignant surprise and Martin's dis satisfaction.

Mr. Marsh, aroused by the commotion, was already dressed, but finding the intruder in the arms of Somnus and his own easy chair, and conscious that his forcible ejection would create a noise and disturbance unpleasant to all parties, after his first ejaculatory observa tion, \" Dear, dear, this is really very unplea- * Dirdum \u2014 confusion, noise."], [236, "224 STUNG TO THE QUICK. sant ! \" he desired Martin and Nancy to \" Leave him alone ; let him sleep off the fumes of liquor.

Thereupon Nancy read the housemaid a lecture on the folly of thinking herself wiser than her betters, and her duty to do as Mr. Marsh ordered without consulting her own whims and fancies ; a homily which did not tend to allay Bella's irritation in the least. She was scrupulously neat, clean, and a pretty good temper when her work went on smoothly and without interruption, but only then. The cold water which in splashing the hearth more than sprinkled her stockings, somewhat heated her temper, and the presence of a drunken man in the room she had to prepare for breakfast, with visitors in the house too, over came what little philosophy she possessed.

Here and there the lighter furniture was whisked to make room for her brush, and not finding it very convenient to sweep under the easy chair with a man in it, the carpet broom made a very impatient onslaught on the sleeper's ex tended legs, causing a grunt, and an involun tary movement of the offending limbs. Then the handle (of course by accident) came in sharp contact with his head, from which the hat had fallen; then his elbow received a similar salute, and the \" funny-bone \" being touched, the owner thereof wakened to a sort of dreamy consciousness of pain, and of a petti coat fluttering about him at the same time. \" Mary, my de-ar,\" began he, drowsily \" Maw neam's nut Meary,\" answered she, curtly. \" Then Sarah, my lo-ove.\" \" An awm nut Sairah \u2014 my neam's Bella Blacket, an awm nowther ' dear ' nor ' luive ' o' thine, aw'd have thee knaw.\" \" Then Bella, my dear, gi-ve me your hand to help me-e up.

Down went the broom from her hand, upsetting a tripod fire-screen in its descent, which in turn invaded the sanctuary of the brass-topped fender, and overturned shovel, tongs, and poker with a rattle, just as the palm of Bella's hand saluted her new admirer's cheek much more warmly than he bargained for. \" Tak that, an' learn to keep your distance fra a decent lass. Awm none o' yor sort, aw'd have you knaw,\" cried she, in an indignant tone, which rose above the clash of falling irons, and contributed not a little to expedite the arrival of the whole household on the spot, guests and all.

Curiosity con tended with fatigue, and, as may be supposed, obtained the mastery ; and in proportion to the degree of curiosity was the speed exhi bited in dressing; consequently Mr. Fortescue and Bella were surrounded by a number of wondering and inquiring faces, and \" What's the matter?\" sounded like a concerted chorus. Mr. Marsh's desire had been to avoid any thing of the kind, and to get his unwelcome visitor away quietly after a sobering sleep ; but Bella's impatient temper had defeated his plan, and his only chance now was to make the best of it, and turn the fellow out before he had time to annoy his niece.

Then he began to congratulate Martin on being such a lucky old fellow as to serve so fair a mistress. \" So aw be, Captain ; Miss Eva's like a breeght angel flitting aboot th' hawse, wi' a smile an' a blessed word for everybody, high an' low,\" assented Martin, very cheerfully."], [251, "AN UNEXPECTED MORNING CALL. 239 This was not exactly what Cuthbert ex pected ; another mistress had occupied his imagination ; but, reminded thus opportunely that Eva, whom he had for the instant lost sight of, was actual mistress in her father's household, he steered on a different tack. \" Ay, ay, Martin, so she is, and always was, even as a child ; but I think she always will be a child \u2014 quite a different craft to her cousin.

No cockney sportsman whose gun has exploded and shattered a finger, in conse quence of an overcharge of the combustible black powder, so inoffensive in flask or cool cellar, could be more amazed or mortified than Mrs. Coulson and her coadjutors at the result of her carefully concocted scheme for the annoyance of a \" cruel husband \" and a \" haughty young miss.\" True, they had gloried, as little minds can, in the petty gratification of preoccupying a room, displaying finery, and mustering adhe rents in the faces of imaginary competitors. True, they had succeeded in rousing Mr. Hesketh's ire, and stinging Rhoda to the quick ; but, in the inevitable scene which"], [255, "DESERTS AND DESERTERS. 243 followed, and on which Mrs. Hesketh and her prompter relied as the culminating point of their triumph, they had shown only to a disadvantage ; nay, been defeated on their own ground, and experienced the defection of their chief warrior. In other words, Jack Fortescue, who had written a comic song \" to order,\" fully believing the story of the \" lamb,\" in its integrity, was so thoroughly annoyed and disgusted at being made the dupe and, the tool of two vulgar-minded women, and, set in the dark to work their malicious ends, was at once so irritated and self-abased at the mean and contemptible part he had been made to play, that he turned round upon them, and with the ut most contempt demanded how they dared to make him the instrument to insult a lady, \u2014 a young lady, too, whose peculiar position should have secured her from caricature.

Fie would, however, make what reparation was in his jiower ; he would apologise and explain. He was a gentleman, and would not be mixed up with blackguardism. Much more he said to the same purpose, drinking, as he stood, glass after glass of wine in his excitement, scarcely conscious of what he did. No disclaimers of Mrs. Hesketh or Mrs. Coulson could satisfy the irritated young gentleman- that they had outlined the insult ing song with a pure motive ; and as right generally obtains more open adherents than wrong, the two soon found themselves in a minority in a very pertinacious and undigni fied dispute. The party was split up into factions, and all the pleasure was at an end. Then Mr. Fortescue insisted on returning by water, and, accompanied by his foppish friend, bent his steps towards a small skiff kept for the accommodation of visitors. He was not in a condition to take charge of the boat, nor was his companion, so two others,"], [257, "245 DESERTS AND DESERTERS. dreading some disaster, volunteered to follow and accompany them, \u2014 as much, be it said, from disgust at the whole proceedings and sympathy with the reckless young fellow, as from a sincere desire to prevent him running himself or Mr. Lighthead into clanger. There was wholesale defection ! Four of their knights gone in a body, and the re mainder in a state of insubordination ! Some few, however, whose sense of honour and propriety was not too clearly defined, were sorry for Mrs. Hesketh, and endeavoured to console her under the fire of Mr. Fortescue's reproofs. But nothing could restore harmony to the ill-assorted party. Mrs. Coulson, fat and jolly, bustled about to provide tea, and Mrs. Hesketh, chafing with spleen and mortifica tion, called upon Lucy to assist, but she sat in the window where Edwin Grove had left her, biting her finger-nails and tormenting herself with possibilities regarding Rhoda, and her own deceitful, inconstant lover, and came forward sulkily and reluctantly."], [258, "246 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Pleasure having taken wing, there was little inducement for discontented people to remain, and the desertion of four cavaliers had left double that number of disconsolate damsels to look and speak their dissatisfaction. Of course all blame fell on the shoulders of Mrs. Hesketh and Mrs. Coulson, and made their situation so far from enviable, that they rejoiced equally when the day came to a close, and the party dispersed with few leave-takings, to right or left as they passed through Durham, the latter, a capital whip, heading a division into Gilesgate, whilst Lucy and her mother, within a hired chaise, in solitary state were driven to their cheerless house in New Elvet. I say cheerless, advisedly ; for though Mrs. Hesketh had sold, or condemned to inferior uses, the old furniture of best parlours and bed-rooms, substituting rosewood and damask for mahogany and moreen ; though frames of pictures and chimney-glass had been re-gilt ; though lustres sparkled on the chimney-piece of white marble, which had itself ousted a"], [259, "DESERTS AND DESERTERS. 247 wooden predecessor rich with carved wreaths and quaint medallions, but \" hideously old fashioned, my dear ; \" though beads or Berlin wool, worked into screens, mats, cushions, and ottomans, in all the hues of the rainbow ; though vases and glittering nick-nacks lay here and there; though the cold grate was hid beneath a screen of paper feathers ; though the slant rays of the setting sun glinting through the windows lit up each prism of the lustres, and made Jack-o'-lanterns on wall and ceiling ; though everything was bright and shiny, the whole was cold and cheerless. It was a room for show more than use. The very lustres might have been icicles left behind by winter, and which even that August sun had failed to thaw. No speck, no shred of linen, no end of thread, lay on the carpet ; no open book, no thimble, no stray reel, or scissors on the bright table gave token of occupancy. The piano was closed, music books out of sight ; no work-basket couched in a dark"], [260, "248 STUNG TO THE QUICK. corner ; no desk, with key in lock, suggested the presence of fingers to ply the needle or the pen. It was a room to look at, not to live in ; and its fellows were like unto it, prim and cold, if less grand and glittering. There visitors were received in ceremonious state, but not entertained ; and one great source of dissension between Mr. and Mrs. Hesketh had been his desire to convert to home or hospitable use the frigid rooms she kept for mere show. But the cheerlessness arose from something apart from unused furniture. It has always seemed to me as if a house reflected its inmates, and accordingly as they were genial, or unsocial, or contentious, or sordid, such would be the aspect of the abode ; and so this house perked itself up with an assump tion of grandeur, only to be maintained by a sacrifice of home comfort and genuine hos pitality. Mirth and laughter were out of the ques tion there. Mrs. Coulson, and a select few, occasionally had tea with Mrs. Hesketh, but"], [261, "249 DESERTS AND DESERTERS. the tray never travelled beyond the back parlour, nor the conversation beyond the limits of conventional gossip, and if a joke was cracked, ten to one but a reputation was cracked with it. A girl of Lucy's age and temper should have put warmth into a dull house ; but she did not ; girls of warm and kindly disposi tions could not assimilate with her ; girls of corresponding temperament and manner dis puted with her for rule and mastery, or battled about each other's private affairs, until the hastily formed acquaintanceships broke suddenly from their very want of cohe sion ; and so the maiden grew up, unlovely (though good-looking enough), unloving, and unloved. Rude and turbulent she had been as a child ; when the mistaken mother, instead of curbing or correcting, applauded her spirit, and permitted her to ride rough-shod over, first her brother, then her playmates (when they would submit), then the servants, and next her father."], [262, "250 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Not one of these but rebelled. Cuthbert was sent to sea, playmates forsook her, ser vants refused to remain beyond their terms, the father threatened to thrash her, and ended by removing his office from the house. Then the mother found that she had fos tered a spirit of rebellion even against herself. It was no longer a tiny foot that stamped, a little hand that clenched, a baby lip that pouted, or an infant's treble that shrieked \" I will ! \" It was a fast and saucy girl, who took boldly that which had been given freely, and then demanded more. In vain Mrs. Hesketh tried to repress the spirit she had formerly fostered. In vain she attempted to retain her household sceptre. Lucy disputed her sway, acknowledged no will but her own, and derided all counsel. Only in one thing were mother and daughter unanimous, and that was in pre senting a fair face to their narrow world. However much they might contend in pri vate, some secret instinct bade them present an amiable front to strangers. Now and"], [263, "251 DESERTS AND DESERTERS. again a sharp glance or a hot word would betray the smouldering fires, but self-interest enabled them as a rule to keep up appear ances, and superficial observers wondered how Mr. Hesketh could neglect his agreeable wife and daughter so very much. Servants, however, told a different story when they met their friends at the mangle, the shop counter, or the hirings, and so ru mour gradually set afloat a something not very far removed from the truth ; but of course, that was \"rank slander,\" and Mrs. Hesketh was virtuously shocked at the first intimation of it. Someway or other Edwin Grove had been entrapped by the pretty face of Lucy Hesketh before he had well emerged from his medical pupilage ; they had wandered together by the banks of the river, or under the shadow of the woods, where the new North-road now spreads a path, or along to the strawberry gardens of New Durham, whilst his father believed him compounding drugs in the surgery, or study ing anatomy in his own room."], [264, "252 STUNG TO THE QUICK. She made no secret of these rambles, although she never named them at home until questioned, not thinking it necessary to consult any but her own will on the subject, and when taken to task assumed a right to please herself, not warranted by her age or experience. However, as Edwin Grove was esteemed a \" good catch,\" she was permitted to have her own way unopposed, and gradually the walks began or ended in Old Elvet. Dr. Grove, having a practice too extensive both in area and number to permit any loitering for garrulity, either on his own part, or that of his patients, was the last to hear of his son's tenderness for Miss Hesketh ; and when he did, wisely held his peace, in the belief that it would be folly to whip a top he wished to subside to repose. Nevertheless, Edwin was shortly despatched to London, to walk the hospitals, and take his degree, no suspicion of ulterior motive transpiring. Mrs. Hesketh grumbled at the heavy postage ; but for all that, letters so folded as"], [265, "DESERTS AND DESERTERS. 253 to baffle prying eyes, and at the same time secure the widest space for correspondence, closely written to the very margin of the ver milion seal \u2014 letters which cost fourteen pence, and were not worth half the money \u2014 used to pass between Lucy and Edwin once a-week or fortnight, and the two considered themselves deeply in love and formally engaged. Apothecaries' Hall was passed, and Edwin Grove had come home for the vacation the very night before the pic-nic, but at too late an hour to desert his father, and visit his inamorata. Besides, if the truth may be told, the fervour of his love had cooled down a little during his probation in the great city, and his ideas of woman in the abstract had taken a very much wider range. His ideal was no longer a vision of blue eyes and tawny hair, an elliptical nose, or a skin of fair red and white. Some glimmering perception that mind and soul gave permanence to beauty, had dawned upon him in his walks through street or hos-"], [266, "254 STUNG TO THE QUICK. pital, and it somehow happened that his letters grew insensibly shorter and farther apart. He was not conscious of any change in himself, yet when his father carried him off to Finchale, Edwin raised no dissenting voice, and excused himself from rushing to see Lucy at once, on the ground that one day would not make much difference, and she need not know how that one day was spent. Just in the frame of mind to be fascinated with Rhoda, and acknowledge her superior charms, Edwin Grove was in exact proportion to his disloyalty prepared to resent the slightest show of corresponding wavering on the part of Lucy ; whilst she, believing him hundreds of miles away, suddenly opening her eyes to see him bend over another, and that Rhoda, to hear his whispered compliments, and watch his lingering glances, may not be supposed in the best frame of mind to be taken to task for a less licence than he had accorded himself. In that half hour, she gathered up a store"], [267, "DESERTS AND DESERTERS. 255 of jealous resentment with which she met his first rude query as to her business there : and so it was, the two met in anger who had anti cipated meeting in love and happiness.

Still a calmer reply, even a similar question put to himself as a lady might speak, would have brought him back (for in heart he had never strayed), but her rude and rebellious spirit spoke its own rude language, and when he left the room he went away shocked and confounded."], [268, "CHAPTER XVII.

Rage, jealousy, and slighted love made Lucy furious with passion, and once at home a tor rent of invectives poured from her lips. She reproached her mother for the whole scheme, ignoring the part she had herself taken in it, whilst her mother retaliated with a charge of ingratitude and want of feeling."], [269, "257 A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. Then the two united in declaring Mr. Hesketh the sole cause of the day's mishaps, and sat down together in their gloomy back parlour, with sharp eager faces, impatient to tell him what they thought of him, when he came home. And there they sat, Lucy biting her nails to the quick, and Mrs. Hesketh pattering an impatient foot on the floor ; but the hours went by, midnight came and passed, before the pleasant party at Mr. Marsh's breaking up Mr. Hesketh and Cuthbert strolled home arm in arm, and lit the dull room with their cheer ful countenances. As usual, the bottled up wrath was poured forth ; but not as usual did Mr. Hesketh meet it. There was no spluttering passion, no vehement gesticulation ; he waited till Lucy and her mother had exhausted their eloquence, then decidedly, but with a calmness more im pressive from its very rarity, addressed himself to his wife, taking no notice whatever of Lucy. \" Mrs. Hesketh, you have this day con- VOL.

Mr. Hesketh, heedless of the rude obser vations and commentaries which followed the progress of his speech, continued slowly and deliberately, without stop or wavering, with out elevating his voice above the level of grave decision : \" Neither of the persons so insulted ever"], [271, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 259 injured you by word or deed, the outrage was therefore unprovoked and unjustifiable, and I, being compromised by the act of those who bear my name, have resolved to prevent such a scandal in the future.\" \"You have resolved, indeed! \u2014 you have resolved !

If, Mr. Hesketh ; but you are not master of my purse, and not very often master of yourself.\" A contemptuous laugh of exultation followed this remark, echoed by tittering Lucy. \"You can keep your own private income for pocket-money, Maria ; you will no doubt require it before long. I am at least a master of arithmetic, and counsel economy.\" \" Counsel economy, indeed ! I shall do what I please with my own,\" retorted she, provoked by his quietness and the turn matters were taking. \" With your own, but not with mine."], [273, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 261 Henceforth, I pay for nothing I do not myself order, permit no visitors I do not invite or approve ; and as you are incapable of controlling your domestics, or entertaining my friends pleasantly, I shall place the house hold under other management.\" Here was an announcement, which took Mrs. Hesketh by surprise, the more so that the quiet determination in his manner produced the effect of conviction. Choking with suppressed rage at the idea of his bringing a stranger home to domineer over her, she rose to her feet with a torrent of abuse on her lips, but before she could utter more than a few unintelligible words about \" tyranny \" and \" parsimony,\" she sank into her chair in a violent fit of hysterics. Time had been that Mr. Hesketh would have reproached himself as the cause of such emotional display, and exhausted every art to restore her; but he simply bade Lucy attend to her mother, and, if she did not revive presently, throw a bowl of cold water over her ; then, without more ado,"], [274, "262 STUNG TO THE QUICK coolly lit a chamber candle and retired to bed.\" Cuthbert, as previously arranged, had gone up-stairs at once to avoid being drawn into any dispute, and to his room Mr. Hesketh went \u2014 not to his own, so that the hysterical lady, when she came to herself, might reflect in solitude on all he had said. And the hysterics over, she did reflect, and, in spite of her anger and exasperation, arrived at the conclusion that Mr. Hesketh was in earnest, more in earnest than she had ever seen him, and so she told Lucy. Lucy, however, had no care for her mother's trouble, she was wrapped up in self, and per plexed how to regain her ascendency over Edwin Grove, without stooping to own her self in the wrong. That she was determined she never would do ; for she argued he had no right to blame her for being at a pic-nic with gentlemen unknown to him, whilst he was at another, paying attentions to a handsome woman unknown to her. Much as she might affect to depreciate"], [275, "263 A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. Rhoda, there lurked in her little mind a sort of consciousness that she would be a dangerous and powerful rival, and as all the love she could spare from herself had been given to Edwin Grove, she was not too comfortable in the reflection that her own hasty and inconsiderate retort had given him a sort of pretext for inconstancy. At her father's threats she laughed, having no belief in his strength of purpose, and more over, they were not levelled against herself; but there was something in Edwin's conduct to warrant her jealous fears. Had he not come home from London without even writing to inform her? Surely, if he loved her as he used to say, he would have rushed to see her before he had been an hour in Durham, in stead of which he had gone off flirting with that beggar-woman's bairn. How long had he been at home, she wondered. Surely, not very long. He could not be so cruel as to treat her so. But she would find it out, and if he were inclined to flirt she would flirt too. She would let him see there were beaux to be"], [276, "264 STUNG TO THE QUICK. had in Durham without him. Mr. Lighthead had been very particular in his attentions, and she would just let the fickle young gentleman see that she could have two strings to her bow as well as himself. He would be coming in in the morning to make an excuse and ask her forgiveness, and wouldn't she plague him then ? She would give him a lesson he should not forget. The morning came, as mornings generally do, whether we are prepared for them or not, whether we open our eyes to the daylight of this world or another, and found the two ladies both sleepy and sulky. They would not go down to breakfast, it would mortify the tyrant if they did not appear to say good-bye to Cuthbert before he started, and serve him right for his airs ! Much to their surprise, when they did con descend to walk down-stairs, they discovered they had neither been inquired for nor waited for, and that, both father and son had departed in excellent spirits. Moreover, the servant had received her orders for dinner without any"], [277, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 265 reference to the wishes of her mistress, ex pressed or understood ; and whilst Mrs. Hesketh yet stood aghast at this audacious innovation, the blue-bloused butcher's boy handed in a joint hitherto excluded from their table, for the sole reason that Mr. Hesketh had a preference for it. Utterly confounded by a display of decision such as she had witnessed but once before in the course of her married life, namely, on the occasion of the office transfer, Mrs. Hesketh sat appalled, leaving her toast to toughen, and her coffee to cool, whilst she marvelled what further act of insubordination she might expect from her hitherto submissive hus band. It is all very well for a wife by dint of caprice and ill-temper to rule her husband and home, and believe her position impreg nable, so long as the man is willing to submit to control, from that indolent love of ease which disinclines him to take the field against a woman armed with a stinging tongue, but once let him rouse from his apathy,"], [278, "266 STUNG TO THE QUICK. and she must succumb to the strong hand in the end, however long and fierce may be the battle for dominion. She may not \" honour,\" she may object to \" obey,\" and sacrifice the happiness of herself and family in perverse abnegation of her marriage vow, rearing her children in the most pernicious moral atmos phere ; but this can only extend to minor matters : in all the great issues of life might and right combine to make the man pre eminent. Gradually temper overcame surprise, and whilst Lucy sipped her coffee, trifled with her toast, and battered an empty egg-shell to shivers, regardless of the silver spoon, in her mental abstraction, Mrs. Hesketh pattered her foot on the carpet and muttered to herself, far too angry to eat. With Lucy in her train, Mrs. Hesketh sought her unfailing friend, Mrs. Coulson, the former leaving a message with Betty, \" Should Mr. Grove call, say I am out, and shall not be at home all the morning ; but if Mr. Lighthead or Mr. Fortescue inquires for"], [279, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 267 either mamma or myself, remember we are gone to Mrs. Coulson's.\" Lucy had arrayed herself in her most becoming bonnet, newest de-laine dress, and black mode scarf, twirling in her hand a large brown parasol with a border of green birds and bushes, the gift of her truant swain, in expectation that somewhere between Old Elvet and Gilesgate she might have an opportunity of dazzling the eyes of either the beau who had been, or the beaux who might be. She stepped along with a set smile, by the side of her frowning mother, defiant alike in dress and demeanour ; but as she crossed Framwellgate Bridge, traversed Saddler Street, emerged into the Market Place, and finally reached Gilesgate without a glimpse of any errant knight, the smile disappeared, and by the time Mrs. Hesketh's green kid had touched the brass knocker on Mrs. Coulson's door there was a frown on Lucy's brow quite as deep as that on her mother's. Mrs. Coulson was not alone. She had"], [280, "268 STUNG TO THE QUICK. held a sort of levee that morning, and two or three confidential friends were closeted with her then, each and all discussing some phase or other of the previous day's disaster. Some had come to impart information, others to inquire the \"rights\" of the case, \" certain to hear the truth from their dear friend, Mrs. Coulson,\" and she, conscious of her own importance as a circulating medium, kept the ball rolling with a condescending affability very delightful to behold. Amongst the various rumours afloat, it was currently reported that Mr. Hesketh, in a state of intoxication and temper, had intruded on a party of strangers, violently assaulted Mr. Fortescue, torn his wife's bonnet to shreds, and all about a comic song. That Captain Hesketh, quite as violent as his father, had pitched Mr. Lighthead through the window, and given some one else a black eye. That Edwin Grove had deserted Miss Hesketh and told her she was not fit to wipe Miss Wearbank's shoes. That he had sent Mr. Fortescue a challenge on account of a"], [281, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 269 song he had made on Miss Wearbank. That Jack Fortescue and three others had been in the river, and two were drowned. That the said Jack Fortescue had gone to Mr. Marsh's dripping wet ; that he had gone on his knees to implore pardon, and been kicked out of the house by Mr. Marsh, who had threatened to shoot him. All these veracious statements found their way to Mrs. Coulson's, albeit some of them had their origin elsewhere, and, in justice to that jolly widow, it is only fair to say, that she endeavoured to correct such reports as her own personal knowledge enabled her to rec tify, making due allowance for her own dis torted view of the question. But as she took for granted all she heard of events beyond her ken, and repeated the same to each comer, the double pic-nic and final outbreak filled all the busy tongues and idle ears of Durham before the day was over. It so happened, however, that no one was drowned, no boat had been upset, and only one person had been in the river, that one"], [282, "270 STUNG TO THE QUICK. being Jack Fortescue, whom his more sober comrades had dragged out of the water, without more inconvenience to themselves than a par tial wetting. But the foolish fellow himself did not escape scot free; as related, he wandered to Mr. Marsh's, slumbered there, and afterwards, when conducted to his chambers, again dropped asleep in his saturated garments which dried upon him ; waked at length cold, stiff, and shivery, by night-fall was in a blazing fever, and in less than three weeks went home to his old father in a leaden coffin. But of this catastrophe Mrs. Hesketh had no prescience, she sought Mrs. Coulson's sym pathy in the full belief that she was grievously ill-used ; that the measures she had adopted to annoy her husband and his exclusive friends were perfectly justifiable, and consequently her indignant spouse's retaliation was most out rageous. When the ordinary gossips had departed with their budgets full, Mrs. Hesketh poured out the story of her wrongs, every few moments calling upon Lucy to corroborate"], [283, "271 A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. her statements, as if she thought her own unsupported testimony unworthy cre dence. \" My dear Mrs. Coulson, what should I do ? \" said she, in most lachrymose tones, when she had ended her story. \" What would you do in my case ? \" \" Well, my dear,\" replied the counsellor, pursing up her mouth in grave deliberation, \" it is not easy to advise.

The click of the new key in the unusual lock, caught the sharp ear of the Doctor, and without looking up from his game, with one eye half closed he Avatched her movements, marked that lining and fittings, from thimble to scissors, were bright and new, though the outside bore evident marks of good rubbing"], [297, "285 THE VALUE OF AN ALLY. and long purchase.

She, however, worked away with a pleasant smile upon her face, fully believ ing that the Doctor must think her notable in the extreme ; but he had seen the look of astonishment alike on the face of father and of mother, and set her down in his own mind as an artful and lazy young miss.

After a time, Mr. Hesketh said, \" Lucy, Dr. GroATe would like a little music.\" This Avas commonplace enough, but Lucy gave a visible start of astonishment at the unwonted request, which took the tone of a command, and which at another time she would have hesitated to obey ; then, how ever, she thought it advisable to comply"], [299, "287 THE VALUE OF AN ALLY. with a good grace, and, indeed, Avas rather pleased than otherwise that her father had given her a chance of displaying her skill as a musician. Her fingers had been educated much better than her heart, so she played the overtures from \"William Tell\" and \" Fra Diavolo\" to the entire satisfaction of herself and auditory, and the Doctor thanked her very heartily. \"Have the goodness, Maria, to order supper,\" said Mr. Hesketh to his wife when the piano was closing. That lady bristled on the instant, and a sharp reply rose to the tip of her tongue ; but the Doctor happening to look up, she marched from the room, more to cover her OAvn defeat than to give the desired order.
