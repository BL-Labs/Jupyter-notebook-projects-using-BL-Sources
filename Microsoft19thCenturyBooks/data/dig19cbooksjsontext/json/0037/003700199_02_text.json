It may not be improper to state, that the greater part of this Second Volume is founded upon documents which have not been exa- mined by any writer of Scottish History. Of these, some have been published considerably subsequent to the date of the composition of any other history. Other most valuable re- cords have been consulted, which, although transcribed and partly printed, are not yet communicated to the public. To the first class belongs the great national work printed, in the years 1814 and 1819, at the expense of Government, by command of his late Ma jesty, entitled \" Rotuli Scoti\u00e6,\" the publica- tion of which was originally suggested by the present learned Deputy- Clerk-Register, Mr Thompson, and committed to the superintend-"], [14, "VI PREFACE. ence of Mr David Macpherson, the able Edi- tor of Winton' s Chronicle. It consists of two very large folio volumes, embracing a collec- tion of historical records, relative to the poli- tical transactions between England and Scot- land, from the nineteenth year of the reign of Edward the First to the eighth of Henry the Eighth. These records consist of rolls, which are preserved in the Tower and the Chapter- House at Westminster ; and, although the se- ries is not quite complete, and, owing to their being exclusively written in Latin or in Nor- man French, the work is uninviting to the ge- neral reader, it is not too much to say, that, considered as materials for authentic history, the \" Rotuli Scoti\u00e6\" is one of the most valua- ble presents which could have been made to the country.

From the materials furnished by these re cords, as well as from other sources, to which it is unnecessary here to allude, I have endea voured to give clearness and consistency to a portion of history hitherto in many places ob scure \u2014 the reign of David the Second, which immediately preceded the accession of the House of Stewart to the throne. It was during this period that Edward the Third attempted to make himself master of Scotland, both by force of arms and by political intrigue; and that the country, although four times invaded by this able and victorious prince in person, deserted by a part of its nobility, and betrayed by its king, contrived successfully to maintain its liberty. I have been accused of injustice in delineating the character of Edward the First, and of being actuated by a national bias ;"], [16, "VIII PREFACE. and, although anxious to weigh with scrupulous impartiality the characters of the principal ac tors in the scenes which I have described, it is possible I may have been unable wholly to di vest myself of individual feelings. Yet, in wri ting the history of a brave people, resolutely struggling for their independence under cir cumstances of peculiar discouragement, it is difficult to be a friend of freedom and not to sympathize with their sufferings, \u2014 not to feel indignation at unjust aggression, and satisfac tion when the attempt is met with disappoint ment and defeat. And surely, if the circum stance, that it was an English Monarch who was misled, by the spirit of ambition and con quest, into a glaring disregard of the most sacred rights and sanctions, had induced the historian to dilute his censure, or to assume a tone of palliation and apology, there would have been room for a severer, because a more merited, impeachment, in which every man who has tasted the sweetness of freedom, or felt the insolence of conquest, would have"], [17, "PREFACE. IX risen in witness against him. I am far from be ing blind to the great qualities of Edward the First ; but it is with this king in his transac tions with Scotland that a historian of Scotland has to do, and not with his character as an English King. In the \" Enquiry into the State of Ancient Scotland,\" it was my object to communicate authentic information upon the general ap pearance of the country; its ancient feudal constitution ; the manners and amusements, the superstitions and character, of its people : its progress in agriculture, commerce, and ma nufactures ; and its advancement in the arts which add comfort or ornament to life. I have attempted to direct the spirit of antiqua rian research, which is too often applied in the investigation of questions of inferior moment, to the elucidation of subjects of general inte rest and importance : But the task has not been one of easy execution ; and I have only to hope, that all who are acquainted with the difficulty of procuring information where the h"], [18, "X PREFACE. period is so remote, and the materials are to be derived from such various and scattered sources, will, on this ground, make allowance for the errors into which I may have fallen, and the imperfections which accompany such an investigation.

Unwilling to bring upon himself the odium and unpopularity of an open breach of so recent and sacred a treaty, cement ed as it was by a marriage between King David and his sister, Edward's policy was to induce the Scots themselves to infringe the peace by the private en couragement which he gave to their enemies, and then to come down with an overwhelming force and reduce the kingdom.1 Against these designs there were many circumstances which prevented Scotland from making an effectual resistance. Randolph was indeed nominated Regent, and the talents of this great man in the arts of civil government, appear to have been as conspicuous as in war ; but he was now aged, and could not reasonably look to many more years of life. Douglas, whose genius for military affairs was, perhaps, higher than even that of Randolph, was soon to leave the kingdom on his expedition to the Holy Land ; and the powerful faction of the Comyns still viewed the line of Bruce with the most persevering hatred, and showed themselves ready to rise upon the first opportunity against the government of his son. Nor was this opportunity long of presenting itself. Edward, the eldest son of John Baliol, had chiefly re sided in France since his father's death, but he now came to England, and with the private connivance 1 It is unfortunate that the Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, from which the most authentic and valuable materials for Scottish history are to be drawn, are awanting from the first year to the seventh of the reign of Edward the Third.

Dornagilla, the mother of Baliol, was sister-in-law to the Red Comyn, whom King Robert Bruce had stabbed at Dumfries, so that the rights of the new claimant were immediately supported by the whole weight of the Comyns ; and, no longer awed by the commanding mind of Bruce, disputes and heart-burnings arose amongst the Scottish nobility, at a time when a con centration of the whole strength of the nation was imperiously required. To return to the course of our narrative, Randolph, upon the death of Bruce, immediately assumed the office of Regent, and discharged its duties with a wise and judicious severity. He was indefatigable in his application to business, and his justice was as bold and speedy as it was impartial. An instance of it has been preserved by Bower.1 A priest was slain, and the murderer, having gone to Rome and obtained the Papal absolution, had the audacity to return open ly to Scotland. He was seized and brought before Randolph, who was then holding his court at Inver ness, during a progress through the country. He pleaded the absolution, but at the command of the Regent was tried, condemned, and instantly executed. The Pope, it was remarked by Randolph, might ab solve him from the spiritual consequences of the sin, but it was nevertheless right that he should suffer for the crime committed against the law. Aware of 1 Forduni Scotichron. a Goodal C. 18, book xiii. vol. ii. p. 297."], [40, "4 1329- HISTORY OE SCOTLAND. the important influence of the local magistrates and judges, he made every sheriff responsible for the thefts committed within his jurisdiction ; so that, according to the simple illustrations of the chronicles of those times, the traveller might tie his horse to the inn door, and the ploughman leave his ploughshare and harness in the field, without fear, for if carried away, the price of the stolen article came out of the pocket of the sheriff. Anxious for the continuance of peace, Randolph sent Roger of Fawside on an amicable mis sion to the English king, whilst he took care at the same time to strengthen the borders, to repair the fortifications of the important town of Berwick, and commanded John Crab, the experienced Flemish mer cenary, whom he retained in the pay of Scotland, to remain in that city, and keep a watch upon the mo tions of England.1 In the meantime, as soon as the season of the year permitted, Douglas, having the heart of his beloved master under his charge, set sail from Scotland, ac companied by a splendid retinue, and anchored off Sluys in Flanders, at this time the great seaport of the Netherlands.2 His object was to find out compa nions with whom he might travel to Jerusalem ; but he declined landing, and for twelve days received all visitors on board his ship with a state almost kingly.

At Sluys he heard that Alonzo, the King of Leon and Castile, was carrying on war with Osmyn, the Moor- ish governor of Granada. The religious mission which he had embraced, and the vows he had taken before leaving Scotland, induced Douglas to consider Alonzo's cause as a holy warfare ; and before proceed- ing to Jerusalem, he first determined to visit Spain, and to signalize his prowess against the Saracens. But his first field against the infidels proved fatal to him, who, in the long English war, had seen seventy battles.2 The circumstances of his death were stri- king and characteristic. In an action near Theba, on the borders of Andalusia, the Moorish cavalry were defeated ; and after their camp had been taken, Dou- glas with his companions engaged too eagerly in the pursuit, and being separated from the main body of the Spanish army, a strong division of the Moors rallied and surrounded them. . The Scottish knight endeavoured to cut his way through the infidels, and in all probability would have succeeded, had he not again turned to rescue Sir William Saint Clair of Roslin, whom he saw in extreme jeopardy.

Taking from his neck the casket which contained the heart of Bruce, he cast it before him, and exclaimed with a loud voice, \" Now pass onward as thou wert wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die.\"1 The action and the sentiment were heroic \u2014 and they were the last words and deed of a heroic life, for Douglas fell, overpowered by his enemies ; and three of his knights, and many of his companions, were slain along with their master.2 On the suc ceeding day, the body and the casket were both found on the field, and by his surviving friends conveyed to Scotland. The heart of Bruce was deposited at Melrose, and the body of the \" Good Sir James,\" the name by which he is affectionately remembered by his countrymen, was consigned to the cemetery of his fathers in the parish church of Douglas.

He was gentle and amiable in society, and had an open and delightful expression in his countenance, which could hardly be believed by those who had only seen him in battle. His hair was black and a little-grizzled ; he was broad-shouldered, and somewhat large-boned, but his limbs were cast in the mould of fair and just proportion. He lisped a little in his speech ; but this defect, far from giving the idea of effeminacy, became him well, when contrasted with his high and warlike bearing.1 These minute touches, descriptive of so great a man, were communicated by eye-witnesses to Barbour, the historian of Bruce. The good Sir James was never married ; but he left a natural son, William Douglas, who inherited the high military talents of his father, and with whom we shall soon meet, under the title of the Knight of Liddesdale.

The de signs of Edward Baliol, and the dissembling conduct of Edward the Third, have been already \"alluded to, and it unfortunately happened that there were cir cumstances in the present state of Scotland which gave encouragement to these schemes of ambition. During the wars of King Robert, many English ba rons who had been possessed of estates in Scotland, and not a few Scottish nobles who had treacherously leagued with England, were disinherited by Bruce, and the lands seized in the hands of the crown. By the treaty of Northampton, it was expressly provided that the Scottish estates of three of those English barons, Henry Percy, Thomas Lord Wake, and Hen ry Beaumont, should be restored. Percy was resto red accordingly, but, notwithstanding the repeated requisitions of the English King, the Scottish Regent delayed performance of the stipulations in favour of Wake and Beaumont, and there were strong reasons 1 The coronation oath, in its full extent, is not given by any an cient historian ; but in one part of it the King solemnly swore that he would not alienate the crown lands, or any of the rents of the same, and that whatever lands or revenues fell to the crown, should not be bestowed upon subjects without mature advice. \u2014 Robert son's Pail.

DAVID II. 9 both in justice and expediency for this delay.1 The first of these barons claimed the lordship of Lidel, which would have given him an entrance into Scot land by the Western Marches, while Beaumont, one of the most powerful barons in England, who, in right of his wife, claimed the lands and earldom of Buchan, might have excited disturbances, and facili tated the descent of an enemy upon the coast. These were not the only considerations which induced Ran dolph to suspend performance of this part of the en gagement. Henry de Beaumont and the Lord Wake had violently opposed the whole treaty of Northamp ton, and declared themselves enemies to the peace with Scotland ; they had leagued with the disinherit ed Scottish barons, and had instigated Baliol to an invasion of that country, and an assertion of his claim to the crown. The English King, on the other hand, although speciously declaring his intention to respect that treaty,2 extended his protection to Edward Ba liol ; and when he was perfectly aware that a secret conspiracy for the invasion of Scotland was fostered in his court, of which Baliol, Wake, and Beaumont, were the principal movers, he yet preposterously de manded of Randolph to restore Beaumont and Wake to their estates in that country.3 The power and opulence of Beaumont induced the Avhole body of the disinherited barons4 to combine their strength ; and, aware that no effectual measures 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 461. 2 Rymer, vol. iv. p. 470. 3 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iv. pp. 445, 452, 511, and 518. \u2022 Their names and titles are given by Leland, Collect, vol. i. pp. 552, 553.

It was their first intention to invade Scot land by the marches, but to this the King of Eng land would not consent : he allowed them, however, without any offer of opposition, to embark at Raven shire, near the mouth of the Humber, with the de sign of making a descent on the coast, while, to pre serve the appearance of the good faith which he had broken, he published a proclamation, enjoining his subjects strictly to observe the treaty of Northamp ton.2 In the meantime, Randolph the Regent, who, with his wonted activity and determination, had put himself at the head of an army to resist the hostile designs which he knew to be on foot, died suddenly, without any apparent cause,3 and not without the strongest suspicion of his having been poisoned. Winton and Barbour, both historians of high credit, and the last almost a contemporary, assert that he came by his death in this foul manner, and that the lords, were settled in Scotland as far back as 1288.

In the Earl of Moray Scotland lost the only man whose genius was equal to manage the affairs of the nation, under circumstances of peculiar peril and dif ficulty. In his mind we can discern the rare combi nation of a cool judgment with the utmost rapidity and energy of action ; and his high and uncorrupted character, together with his great military abilities, kept down the discordant factions which began to show themselves among the nobility, and intimida ted the conspirators who meditated the overthrow of the government. Upon his death, a parliament as sembled at Perth for the election of his successor, and the spirit of civil disunion broke out with fatal violence. After great contention amongst the nobi lity, Donald Earl of Mar, nephew to the late king, was chosen regent.2 This nobleman was in every way unfitted for so arduous a situation. When a child, he had been carried into England by Edward the First, and on being released from captivity, had continued to reside in that country, and had even carried arms in the English army against Scotland.

The king appears to have consi dered his talent for war as of a very inferior order, and the result showed how well Bruce had judged.1 In the meantime, on the very day that the reins of the state fell into this feeble hand, word was brought that the fleet of Edward Baliol, and the disinherited barons, had appeared in the Forth. They landed soon after with their army at Kinghorn, where the ground was so singularly unfavourable for the dis embarking of cavalry, that a very small force, led by any of the old captains of Bruce, would have de stroyed the daring enterprise in its commencement. But Mar, who was at the head of a Scottish army more than ten times the strength of the English, lingered at a distance and lost the opportunity, whilst Alexander Seton threw himself, with a handful of soldiers, upon the English, and was instantly over powered and cut to pieces.2 Baliol immediately ad vanced to Dunfermline, where he found a seasonable supply for his small army in five hundred excellent spears, and a quantity of provisions, laid up there by the orders of Randolph, then newly dead.3 \"When he first effected a landing, he had with him only four hundred men ; but by this time he had collected a force of about two thousand foot soldiers,4 and feel- 1 Barbour, p. 387.

DAVID II. 13 ing more confident, he commanded his fleet to sail round the coast and anchor in the mouth of the Tay, while he himself pushed on to Perth, and encamped near Forteviot, with his front defended by the river Earn. On the opposite bank of the river lay the ex tensive tract called Dupplin Moor, upon which the Earl of Mar drew up his army, consisting of thirty thousand men, excellently equipped, and commanded by the principal nobility of Scotland. Eight miles to the west of Forteviot, at Auchterarder, was the Earl of March, at the head of an army nearly as nu merous, with which he had advanced through the Lothians and Stirlingshire, and threatened to attack the English in flank. Nothing could be imagined more perilous than the situation of Baliol ; but he had friends in the Scot tish camps.1 Some of the nobility whose relatives had suffered in the Black Parliament, were decided ene mies to the line of Bruce, and secretly favoured the faction of the disinherited barons ; so that, by means of the information which they afforded him, he was enabled, with a force not exceeding three thousand men, to overwhelm the army of Mar at the moment that his own destruction appeared inevitable.2 It is asserted by an English historian, on the au thority of an ancient MS. chronicle, that the newly 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 304. 2 Bower's Continuat.

An drew Murray of Tullibardine, a Scottish baron, who served in the army of March, treacherously conducted the English to a ford in the river, which he had marked by a large stake driven into its channel.2 Setting off silently at midnight, the English passed the river, and marching by Gask and Dupplin, sud denly broke in upon the outposts of the Scottish camp, and commenced a pitiless slaughter of their enemies, whom they mostly found drunken and heavy with sleep.3 The surprise, although unfortunate, was not at first completely fatal. Young Randolph Earl of Murray, Murdoch Earl of Menteth, Robert Bruce, a natural son of King Robert, and Alexander Fraser, hastily collected three hundred troops, and with the desperate courage of men who felt that all hung upon gaining a few moments, checked the first onset, and drove back the English soldiers. This gave time for the main body of the Scots to arm, and as the morn ing had now broke, the small numbers of the Eng lish army became apparent. But the military inca pacity of the regent destroyed the advantage which might have been improved, to the total discomfiture 1 Barne's Hist, of Ed.

Rushing down at the head of his army, without order or discipline, the immense mass of sol diers became huddled and pressed together ; spear men, bowmen, horses, and infantry, were confounded in a heap, which bore down headlong upon the Eng lish, and in an instant overwhelmed Randolph and his little phalanx.1 The confusion soon became in extricable : multitudes of the Scottish soldiers were suffocated and trodden down by their own men, and the English, preserving their discipline, and under brave and experienced leaders, made a pitiless slaughter. The route now became total, and the carnage, for it could not be called a battle, continued from early dawn till nine in the morning, by which time the whole of the Scottish army was slain, dispersed, or taken prisoners. So rapid and easy had been the victory, that the English ascribed it to a miraculous interference for their preservation, and the Scots to a sudden infliction of divine vengeance. But the military incapacity of Mar, and the treachery of Murray, sufficiently account for the disaster. On examining the field, it was found that multi tudes had perished without wound or stroke of wea pon, over-ridden by their own cavalry, suffocated by the pressure and weight of their armour, or trod un der foot by the fury with which the rear ranks had pressed upon the front.2 On one part of the ground the dead bodies lay so thick, that the mass of the 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 152, 153. !

The young Randolph Earl of Moray, whose conduct that day had been worthy of his great father, Robert Earl of Carrick, a natural son of King Edward Bruce, Alexander Fraser, Chamberlain of Scotland, who had married the sister of the late king, Murdoch Earl of Menteth, Robert Bruce, a natural son of King Robert, and the Regent Mar himself, were amongst the slain. In addition to these, there fell many Scottish knights, and men-at-arms, and probably not less than thirteen thousand infantry and camp followers.2 Duncan Earl of Fife was made prisoner, after a brave resistance, in which three hundred and sixty men-at-arms, who fought under his banner, were slain. Of the English the loss was inconsiderable : besides those of less note, it included only two knights and thirty-three esquires, a dispari ty in the numbers, which, although very great, is not without parallel in history.3 There does not occur in our Scottish annals a greater or more calamitous defeat than the route at Dupplin, even when stript of all the absurd and incredible additions of Eng lish historians.4 It was disgraceful, too, as its cause is to be found in the military incapacity of Mar the leader, and in the acknowledged treachery of one, 1 WTinton, vol. ii. p. 155. 2 Walsingham p. 131.

DAVID II. 17 and probably of more than one, of the Scottish ba rons. The principal of these, Murray of Tullibar din, was speedily overtaken by the punishment which he deserved : he was made prisoner at Perth, tried, condemned, and executed.1 After the battle of Dupplin, Baliol instantly press ed forward and took possession of Perth, which he fortified by palisades, with the intention of abiding there the assault of the enemy, for the Earl of March was still at the head of a powerful army of thirty thousand men. March was a baron of great landed power, but lightly esteemed by all parties f timid, and intent upon his own interest, unwilling to peril his great estates by an adherence to the losing side, and possessed of no military talents. Upon hearing the account of the defeat at Dupplin, he passed with his army over the field of battle, which presented a ghastly confirmation of the tale ; and on reaching Lammerkin Wood, commanded the soldiers to cut faggots and branches to be used in filling up the fosse, should they assault Perth, against which town he now advanced. The near approach of so great an army, alarmed the citizens, who began to barricade the streets and the approach to their houses. But on reaching the high ground immediately above the town, March commanded his men to halt. Beau mont, who intently watched his operations, observing this, called out \" to take courage, for he knew they 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1020. Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 307. 2 Scala.

It is certain at least, that this powerful baron had engaged in a treasonable correspondence with Baliol ; as the in tended assault was delayed, and the protracted mea sure of a blockade preferred ; a change, which, in the mutual situation of the two parties, can be ac counted for on no ground but that of a friendly feeling to Baliol. At this moment, Crab, the Fle mish mercenary, appeared with his fleet in the Tay, and attacked the English ships. He was at first suc cessful, and made a prize of the Beaumondscogge, Henry de Beaumont's vessel ; but the rest of the fleet defended themselves with such resolution, that in the end, Crab was defeated, and compelled to fly to Ber wick.2 This disaster gave March a plausible pretext for deserting. The blockade was changed into a re trograde movement, which soon after ended in the total dispersion of the Scottish army, and, after a de cent interval, in the accession of the Earl of March to the English interest.3 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 156.

The chief causes which led to this remarkable re volution, destined for a short time to overthrow the dynasty of Bruce, are not difficult of discovery. The concluding part of the late king's reign, owing to the severity with which he punished the conspiracy of Brechin, had been unpopular, and part of the dis- treachery, and that of the \" noble persons\" who acted along with him, hangs on Beaumont's speech. Now, the annalist is guilty of a little piece of suppression in curtailing this speech. Beaumont really said, \" Take courage, for that army, as I conjecture, will not hurt us, because I perceive, without doubt, our friends and well-wishers amongst them.\" Hailes makes him say, \" Take cou- rage, these men will not hurt us ;\" and he then observes, \" Whe- ther he said this merely to animate the English, or whether he formed his conjecture from the disordered motions of the enemy, or whether he indeed discerned the banners of some noble persons, who secretly favoured Baliol, is uncertain.\" And yet after all, for these conjectures and this alleged uncertainty so plausibly brought in here, there was no ground whatever. Beaumont, in the part of the passage which Hailes has suppressed, expressly affirmed that he perceived friends in March's army. Had he consulted Win ton, he would have found that this old and authentic chronicler, vol. ii. p. 156, makes Beaumont say, \" Look that ye be Merry and glad, and have no doubt, For we have friends in yon route.\" WThat was the object in all this it is not easy to say. 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 157."], [56, "1332. 20 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. contented nobility were not slow in turning their eyes from the line of Bruce, which his great energy and military talents had compelled them to respect, to the claims of Baliol, weak in personal power, but, as they imagined, better supported in right and justice. A party of English barons, headed by Henry Beau mont, one of the most powerful subjects in England, having been dispossessed by Bruce of their estates in Scotland, determined to recover them by the sword, and united themselves with Baliol, concealing their private ambition under the cloak of re-establishing the rightful heir upon the throne. They were mostly men of great power and vassalage, and were all of them more or less connected with the numerous sept of the Comyns, the inveterate enemies of Bruce. They received private encouragement and support from the king of England, and they began their en terprise when the civil government in Scotland, anil the leading of its armies, was in the hands of Mar and March : the first a person of no talents or energy, and suspected of being inclined to betray his trust ; the second undoubtedly a favourer of the English party. There was nothing, therefore, very extraordinary in the temporary recovery of the crown by Baliol ; but a very short time showed him how little depend ence was to be placed on such a possession. The friends of the line of Bruce were still numerous in the country : amongst them were the oldest and most experienced soldiers in Scotland ; and the feelings of the nation were entirely on their side."], [57, "1332. 21 DAVID II. Perth had been fortified by the disinherited lords ; after which Baliol made a progress to the southern parts of Scotland, and committed the custody of the town to the Earl of Fife. It was soon after attacked and stormed by Sir Simon Fraser and Sir Robert Keith, who destroyed the fortifications, and took the constable Fife and his daughter prisoners. Upon this first gleam of success, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, who had married Christian, the sister of the late king, was chosen regent; and his first care was to send the king, then only nine years old, along with his youthful queen, to France, where they were honourably and kindly received.1 Meanwhile Baliol, with ready pusillanimity, hastened to surrender to Edward the liberties of Scotland ; and the English king moved on to the borders with the declared pur pose of attending to the safety of that divided coun try. The transactions which followed at Roxburgh throw a strong light upon the characters of both so vereigns. After many hypocritical declarations as to the so lemn and conscientious observation of the treaty of Northampton, the English king now dropt the mask, and declared, that the successes of Baliol, in Scotland, were procured by the assistance of his good subjects, and with his express permission or sufferance.2 In return for this assistance, Baliol- acknowledged Ed ward as his feudal lord, and promised that he would 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 307.

In addition to this, he became bound to put Edwardin possession of the town, castle, and territory of Berwick, and of other lands in fit and convenient places upon the marches, extending to the value of two thousand pounds ; and affecting to consider the Princess Joanna of England as only betrothed to King David Bruce, he proposed himself as a more convenient match, and offered to provide for David Bruce in whatever way Edward should think fit. He lastly became bound to assist the English king, in all his wars, with two hundred men-at-arms, raised and maintained at his own charges ; and he engaged that his successors should furnish a hundred men-at-arms for the same service. The penalty affixed to the breach of this agreement, was a fatal part of the treaty. If Baliol, or his successors, neglected to appear in the field, they became obliged to pay to England the enormous sum of two hundred thousand pounds sterling ; and if this money could not be raised, it was agreed that Edward should take possession of the \" remainder of Scotland and the isles.\" This last obligation, which was to be perpetually in force, evidently gave Ed ward the power of draining Scotland of its best sol diers, and in the event of resistance, of at once seizing and appropriating the kingdom.1 Thus, in a moment of mean and sordid selfishness, 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iv. pp. 536 and 548."], [59, "1332.

But Baliol's hour of pros- perity was exceeding brief. Strong, as he imagined, in the protection of the king of England, and encou- raged in his security by the readiness with which many of the Scottish barons had consented to recog- nise his title,1 the new king lay carelessly encamped at Annan, not aware of the approach of a body of armed horse, under the command of the Earl of Mo- ray, the second son of the great Randolph, along with Sir Simon Fraser and Archibald Douglas, bro- ther to Bruce's old companion in arms, the Good Sir James. These barons, informed of Baliol's re- missness in his discipline, made a sudden and rapid march from Moffat, in the twilight of a December evening, and broke in upon him at midnight. Taken completely by surprise, the nobles who were with him, and their vassals and retainers, were put to the sword without mercy. Henry Baliol, his brother, after a gallant resistance, was slain ; and Walter Co- myn, Sir John de Moubray, and Sir Richard Kirby, met their deaths along with him. The Earl of Car- rick was made prisoner ; and Baliol, in fear of his life, and almost naked, threw himself upon a horse, and with difficulty escaped into England.2 Carrick, the natural son of King Edward Bruce, would have been executed as a traitor, but young Randolph in- 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1020, 1021.

With the assistance of strangers and mercenary troops, it had cost Baliol only seven weeks to gain a crown. In less than three months it was torn from his brow, he himself chased from Scotland, and cast once more a fugitive and an exile upon the charity of England.1 Encouraged by this success, and justly incensed at the assistance given by Edward to Baliol and the disinherited lords, the Scottish leaders began to reta liate by breaking in upon the English borders. It is a singular instance of diplomatic effrontery, that the English king, on hearing of this invasion, accused the Scots of having violated the treaty of Northamp ton ;2 in his correspondence with the king of France and the court of Rome, he does not hesitate to cast upon that nation the whole blame of the recommence ment of the war;3 and as if this was not enough, the English historians accuse them, in broad terms, of having attacked Baliol at Annan during the exist ence of a truce. Both the one and the other assertion appear to be unfounded.4 1 He landed 31st July, and was crowned 24th Sept.

Hostilities having again broke out between the two nations, the border inroads recommenced with their accustomed fury, but at first were attended with cir cumstances disastrous for Scotland. It happened that Baliol, after his flight from Annan, had experienced the Christmas hospitality of Lord Dacres ; in return for which kindness, Archibald Douglas, at the head of a small army of three thousand men, broke in up on Gillesland, and wasted the country belonging to Dacres with fire and sword, spreading desolation for a distance of thirty miles, and carrying off much booty. To revenge this, Sir Anthony Lucy of Cock ermouth, and William of Lochmaben, with eight hundred men, penetrated into Scotland ; but on their return were encountered by Sir William Douglas, commonly called the Knight of Liddesdale, and at that time keeper of Lochmaben Castle. After a sore conflict, in which Lucy was grievously wounded, Douglas was totally defeated. Of the Scotch, a hun dred and sixty men-at-arms, including Sir Humphrey Jardine, Sir Humphrey Boys, and William Carlisle, were left on the field, and the best of the chivalry of Annandale were either slain or made captive.1 Amongst the prisoners were Douglas himself, Sir William Baird, and a hundred other knights and gentlemen. So pleased was Edward with the prize he had won singham, p. 132, will not prove anything, for neither March nor Douglas were at the head of affairs, but Sir Andrew Moray. 1 Walsingham, p. 132."], [62, "1332. 26 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in the knight of Liddesdale, who was a natural son of the Good Sir James, and inherited his father's re markable talents for war, that he issued special orders for his strict confinement in iron fetters -,1 and Baliol, who, a short time before this success, had again en tered Scotland, and established himself, after some partial successes, in the castle of Roxburgh, endea voured to confirm his authority in Annandale, by be stowing the lands of the knights who were slain up on his English followers.2 Another disaster followed hard upon the defeat of Douglas at Lochmaben. The Regent Sir Andrew Moray, with a strong body of soldiers, attacked and attempted to storm the castle of Roxburgh, where Baliol then lay. A severe conflict took place on the bridge, and in the onset, Ralph Golding, a brave esquire in the regent's service, pushing on far before the rest, was overpowered by the English. Moray, in the ar- dour of the moment, more mindful of his duty as a knight than a leader, attempted singly to rescue him, and instantly shared his fate.3 Disdaining to surren der to any inferior knight, he demanded to be led to the king of England, and being brought to Edward, was thrown into prison, where he remained for two years. The Scots, who had now lost in Douglas and Moray two of their best soldiers, at a time when they so much needed them, endeavoured to supply their place by conferring the office of regent upon Archi- 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 552. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 8.

He assembled a powerful army, besought the prayers of the church for his success, and wrote to the Earl of Flanders, and to the magistrates of Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres, requesting them to abstain from render- ing assistance to the Scots.2 He informed the king of France, who had interposed his good offices in be- half of his ancient allies, that, as the Scots had re- peatedly broken the peace, by invading and despoil- ing his country, he was necessitated to repel these outrages by force of arms ;3 and having taken these preliminary steps, he put himself at the head of his army, and sat down before Berwick. The Scots, on their side, were not unprepared to receive him. Al- though Crab's disaster, in the former year, had weakened their strength by sea, they still possessed a fleet of ships of war, which committed great havoc on the English coasts, and plundered their sea-ports ;4 and Douglas the regent exerted himself to raise an army equal to the emergency. The defence of the cas tle of Berwick was committed to the Earl of March, whose conduct, after the battle of Dupplin, had evinced already the strongest leaning to the English interest ; the command of the town was intrusted to Sir Alex- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 310. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 7 Ed.

The garrison appears neither to have been numerous nor well supplied ; but for some time they made a gallant defence, and succeeded in sinking and destroying by fire a great part of the English fleet. Edward at first attempted to sill up the ditch with hurdles, and to carry the town by assault ; but having been repulsed, he converted the attack into a blockade, and as the strength and extent of his lines enabled him to cut off all supplies, it became appa rent, that if not relieved in a short timej Berwick must fall. After the blockade had continued for some time, a negotiation took place, by which the besieged agreed to capitulate by a certain day, unless succours were thrown into the town before that time ; and for the strict performance of the stipulations, the Scots delivered hostages to Edward, amongst whom was a son of Seton the governor.2 The period had nearly expired, when, one morning at the break of day, the citizens, to their great joy, saw the army of Scotland, led by the regent in person, approach the Tweed, and cross the river at the Yare ford. They approached Berwick on the south side of the river, and although the English endeavoured to defend every passage, Sir William Keith, Sir William Pren dergest, and Sir Alexander Gray, with a body of Scottish soldiers, succeeded in throwing themselves into the town. The main body of the Scots, after having remained drawn up in order of battle, and in 1 Scala Chron. quoted in Hailes, vol. ii. p. 317, and Rotuli Sco ti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 272, Compot.

But although they menaced Bamburgh castle, where Ed ward had placed his young queen, that monarch, intent upon his object, continued before Berwick ; and on the departure of the Scottish rmy, peremptorily required the town to be given up, as the term stipulated for their being succoured had now expired. This demand the besieged refused to comply with ; they asserted that they had received succours, both of men and of provisions ; the knights, they said, who had led these succours, were now with them ; out of their number they had chosen new governors, of whom Sir William Keith was one ; and they declared their intention of defending the city to the last extremity.1 Edward upbraided the citizens, accused them of duplicity, and requested the advice of his council with regard to the treatment of the hostages. It was their opinion that the Scots had broken the stipulations of the treaty, and that the lives of the hostages were forfeited. The king then commanded the son of the late governor to prepare for death, expecting that the threatened severity of the example, and the rank and influence of his father, would induce the townsmen to surren der. But he was disappointed ; and Thomas Seton, a comely and noble-looking youth, was hanged before the gate of the town,2 and, it is said, so near, that the 1 Scala Chron. apud Hailes, vol. ii. p. 316. \u00b0- Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1022."], [66, "1333.

To this resolution Keith their governor encouraged them, by holding out the sure hope of the siege being raised by the Scottish army, which he represented as superior to that of England.2 Un happily they embraced his advice. It was stipulated, in a solemn instrument yet preserved, and with a mi nuteness which should leave no room for a second misunderstanding, that Berwick was to be given up to the English, unless the Scots, before or on the 19th of July, should succeed in throwing two hundred men-at-arms into the town by dry land, or should overcome the English army in a pitched field.3 Keith, the governor of the town, was permitted, by the treaty of capitulation, to have an interview with the regent, Archibald Douglas. He represented the desperate situation of the citizens ; magnified the im- 1 See Appendix, letter C. 2 Scala Chron. in Hailes, vol. ii. p. 319. Ad Murinath, p. 80.

Neither Fordun, nor his continuator Bower, nor Win ton, say any thing of the town having been set on fire. The English historians, W7alsingham -and Hemingford, indeed assert it ; but it is not to be found in the narrative of the Scala Chronicle, -.i Inch ap pears to be the most authentic ; I have therefore omitted it. 3 F\u0153dera, vol. iv. pp. 566, 567."], [67, "1333. 31 DAVID II. portance of the town, which must be lost, he said, unless immediately relieved ; and persuaded the re gent to risk a battle. The resolution was the most imprudent that could have been adopted. It was contrary to the dying injunctions of Bruce, who had recommended his captains never to hazard a battle if they could protract the war, and lay waste the country ; and especially so at this moment, as deser tion and mutiny now began to show themselves in the English army, which all the endeavours of Ed ward had not been able to suppress.1 Notice, too, had reached the camp, of illegal meetings and confedera tions having taken place in London during the king's absence, and the people of the northern shires had peremptorily refused to join the army ; so that there was every probability that it must soon have been disbanded.2 In expectation of this result, Seton, the former governor, had determined to hold out the town to the last extremity, and sternly refused to ca pitulate, although the life of his son hung upon the issue. But his resolution was counteracted by the ignorant rashness of Keith, the new governor of the town, as well as by the excusable affection of the ci tizens for their sons, who were hostages. The re gent suffered himself to be overruled, and on the day before the festival of the Virgin, being the 18th of July, the Scottish army crossed the Tweed, and en camped at a place called Dunsepark. Upon this, Ed- 1 Rotuli Scot. 7 Ed. III. m. 26, dorso, vol. i. p. 235. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 234, 244. 5"], [68, "1333. HLSTOIIY OF SCOTLAND. 32 ward Baliol and the King of England drew up their forces on the eminence of Halidon Hill, situated to the west of the town of Berwick. Nothing could be more advantageous than the position of the English. They were drawn up in four great battalia, each of which was flanked by choice bodies of archers. A marsh divided the hill on which they stood from the opposite eminence, and on this rising ground the Scottish commanders halted and arranged their order of battle.1 It consisted also of four battalia, led re spectively by the regent Douglas ; the Stewart of Scotland, then a youth of seventeen, under the direc tion of his uncle Sir James Stewart ; the Earl of Mo ray, son of the great Randolph, assisted by two ve teran leaders of approved valour, James and Simon Fraser, and the Earl of Ross. The nature of the ground rendered it impossible for the English posi tion to be attacked by cavalry. The Scottish army accordingly fought on foot, and the leaders and heavy armed knights having dismounted, delivered their horses to be kept by the sutlers and camp boys in the rear. Before reaching their enemy, it was ne cessary for them to march through the soft and un equal ground of the marsh ; an enterprise which re quired much time, and was full of danger, as it ine- 1 I take this from an interesting and curious manuscript preserved in the British Museum, Bib.

Yet, contrary to the advice of the elder officers, who had been trained under Bruce and Randolph, this desperate attempt was made, and the Scots, with their characteristic national impetuosity, eagerly ad vanced through the marsh. The consequence was what might have been expected : their ranks, crowd ed together, soon fell into confusion ; their advance was retarded ; and the English archers, who had time for a steady aim, plied their bows with such deadly effect, that numbers of the Scots were every in stant slain or disabled. An ancient manuscript says, that the arrows flew as thick as motes in the sun beam, and that the Scots fell to the ground by thou sands.1 It could not indeed be otherwise; for from the nature of the ground, it was impossible to come to close fighting, and having no archers, they were slaughtered without resistance; the English remaining in the meantime uninjured, with their trumpets and nakers sounding amid the groans of their dying ene mies, while their king was fighting on foot in the front of the battle. Upon this dreadful carnage many of the Scots began to fly; but the better part of the army, led on by the nobility, at last extricated themselves from the marsh, and, pressing up the hill, attacked the enemy with great fury. It was difficult, however, 1 MS. Harleian, Appendix, letter D. Ad Murimuth, p. 80. VOL. II.

The Earl of Ross, in leading the reserve to attack the wing where Baliol commanded, was driven back and slain. Soon after, the regent Douglas was mortally wounded and made prisoner. The Earls of Lennox, Athole, Carrick, and Sutherland, along with James and Simon Fraser, were struck down and killed, while the English, advancing in firm array with their long spears, entirely broke and drove off the field the re mains of the Scottish army. In the pursuit which succeeded, the carnage was very great. Besides the nobles and barons already mentioned, John Stewart, uncle of the Steward of Scotland, was killed, and James Stewart, another of his uncles, was mortal ly wounded and made prisoner. Malise, Earl of Strathern, John de Graham, Alexander de Lindesay, and other barons of high rank, were also slain ; and with them fell, on the lowest calculation, fourteen thousand men. Such was the disastrous defeat of the Scots at Halidon Hill.1 The battle was fought on the twentieth day of July, and the English monarch immediately addressed letters to the archbishops and 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 170.

It seems probable, that nearly the whole of the men-at-arms in the Scottish ranks were put to the sword either in the battle or in the pursuit ; and that of the confused multitude which escaped, the greater part were pages, sutlers, and camp followers. So great was the slaughter of the nobility, that, after the battle, it was currently said amongst the English, that the Scottish wars were at last ended, since not a man was left of that nation who had either skill, power, or inclination, to assemble an army or direct its operations.2 The consequences of the battle of Halidon were the instantaneous delivery of the town and castle of Berwick into the hands of the English, and the sub- 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 166, says the Scots had an army full sixty thousand strong. It is observed by Edward, in his letters ordaining a public thanksgiving, that the victory was obtained without great loss upon his side ; an expression proving the absurdity of the asser tion of the English historians, that of their army only thirteen foot soldiers, with one knight and one esquire, were slain. Nor is it unworthy of remark, that the king makes no allusion to any infe riority of force upon the English side ; which, had such been the case, he could scarcely have failed to do, if we consider the subject of his letter.

The fortresses in question were Dumbarton, which was held by Mal colm Fleming ; Urquhart, in Inverness-shire, com manded by Thomas Lauder ; Lochleven, by Alan de Vipont ; Kildrummie, by Christian Bruce, the sister of Robert the First ; and Lochmaben, by Patrick de Chartres.2 A strong-hold in Lochdown, on the bor ders of Carrick, was also retained for David Bruce by John Thomson, a brave soldier of fortune, and probably the same person, who, after the fatal battle of Dundalk, led home from Ireland the broken re mains of the army of King Edward Bruce.3 Patrick, Earl of March, who had long been sus pected of a secret leaning to the English, now made his peace with them, and swore fealty to Edward ; and along with him many persons of rank and au thority were compelled to pay a temporary homage : but the measures which Edward adopted, on making himself master of Berwick, were little calculated to conciliate the minds of those whom he somewhat prematurely considered as a conquered people.

Orders were also transmitted to the magistrates of London, and other principal towns in the kingdom, directing them to invite merchants and traders to settle in Berwick, under promise of ample privileges and immunities ; and, in the anticipation that these pacific measures might still be inadequate to keep down the spirit of resistance, he emptied the prisons throughout England of several thousands of criminals condemned for murder and other heinous offences, and presented them with a free pardon, on the condi tion of their serving him in his Scottish wars.2 Baliol having thus possessed himself of the crown by foreign assistance, seemed determined to complete 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 8 Ed.

To his royal patron, more extensive sacri fices were due. Not only was the town, castle, and extensive county of Berwick surrendered to the King of England, but the forests of Jedburgh, Selkirk, and Ettrick, the wealthy counties of Roxburgh, Peebles, Dumfries, and Edinburgh, the constabularies of Lin lithgow and Haddington, with the towns and castles situated within these extensive districts, were, by a solemn instrument, annexed for ever to the kingdom of England.1 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. pp. 614. 616.

Beaumont, taking the law into his own hands, retired to his strong castle of Dundarg in Buchan, and seized a large portion of the disputed lands which lay in that earldom. Athole removed to his strong holds in the country of Athole ; and Talbot, who had married the daughter of the Red Comyn slain by Bruce,1 collected his vassals, and prepared for war. Encouraged by the disunion amongst their enemies, the old friends of the dynasty of Bruce began again to reappear from their concealment ; and, at this fa vourable conjuncture, Sir Andrew Moray of Both well2 was released from his captivity, and returned to Scotland. At the same time, the Scottish ships of war, assisted by a fleet of their allies, richly la den with provisions and arms, and well manned with soldiers, hovered on the coast, and threatened to in tercept the English vessels which had been sent by Edward with supplies for his adherents in Scot land.3 Baliol in the meantime, irresolute and alarm ed, retreated to Berwick, and reversed his decision in favour of Mowbray.

This, how ever, was no easy enterprise. Situated on a precipi tous rock overhanging the Murray Firth, the strong retreat which Beaumont had chosen was connected with the mainland by a neck of land so narrow, that a few resolute men could defend it against a multitude. To attempt to storm it would have been certain defeat ; and Moray chose rather, by a strict blockade, to compel Beaumont to surrender. An unexpected circumstance accelerated his success. Ha ving discovered the situation of the pipes which sup plied the garrison with water, he mined the ground, cut them through, and reduced the English baron to extremity.

Amongst the numerous confiscations which fol lowed his brief possession of power, Baliol conferred the extensive possessions of Robert, the Steward of Scotland, upon the Earl of Athole ; while this young baron himself, ever since the calamitous battle of Hali don, had lain concealed in Bute, and escaped the search of his enemies. With a prudence and determination superior to his years, he now organised a plan for escaping to the castle of Dumbarton, in which he hap pily succeeded. Two old vassals of the family, named Gibson and Heriot, brought a boat to Rothesay late in the evening, and the Steward, accompanied only by a chamber-boy and two servants, threw himself into it, and rowed that night to Overtunnock, from which they crossed to Dumbarton, where they were joyfully welcomed by Malcolm Fleming the governor.1 Here he did not long remain inactive ; but assembling his scattered vassals, with the assistance of Colin Camp bell of Lochnow, he attacked and stormed the castle of Dunoon in Cowal. The news of this success soon flew to Bute ; and there the hereditary vassals of the young patriot in stantly rose upon the English governor, Alan de Lyle, put him to death, and proceeded, carrying his head in savage triumph along with them, to join their master. The Castle of Bute soon after fell in to the hands of the insurgents.2 1 WTinton, vol. ii. p. 178.

On the first in telligence that the Steward had displayed open ban ner against the English, these fugitives, says an an cient historian, came suddenly, like a swarm of hor nets, from the rocks and woods, and warred against the common enemy. The chief of these was Wil liam de Carruthers, who since the success of Baliol had preferred a life of extremity and hardship, as a fugitive in the woods, to the ignominy of acknow ledging the English yoke. He now left his strong holds, and with a considerable force united himself to the Steward.1 Thomas Bruce, with the men of Kyle, next joined the confederacy; and soon after Ran dolph, Earl of Moray, who had escaped to France after the defeat at Halidon Hill, returned to his na tive country, and; with the hereditary valour of his house, began instantly to act against the English. Strengthened by such important accessions, the Stew ard in a short time reduced the lower division of Clydesdale ; compelled the English Governor of Ayr to acknowledge King David Bruce ; and expelled the \" Amang the Brandanis all The Batayle Dormang they it call.\" \" The battle Dormang is evidently, \" Macpherson remarks, \" a corruption of the Batail nan domaig.\" Dorneag being a round stone : A proof that, in Bute, the Gaelic was then the common language.

The Scottish nobles of the party of David Bruce now assembled, and preferred this young patriot and the Earl of Moray to the office of joint regents under their exiled king. The choice was in every respect judicious. The Steward, although now only in his nineteenth year, had early shown great talents for war ; he was the grandson of Robert the First, and had been already declared by Parsiament the next heir to the crown : Moray, again, was the son of the great Randolph ; so that the names of the new governors were associated with the most heroic pe riod of Scottish history, \u2014 a circumstance of no trivial importance at a period when the siberties of the coun try were threatened with an utter overthrow. About the same time, the spirits of the party were cheered by the arrival of a large vessel loaded with arms, be sides wines and merchandize, in the Port of Dumbar ton ; \u2014 a circumstance which Edward considered of so much importance, that he directed his writs to the Magistrates of Bristol and Liverpool, commanding them to fit out some ships of war to intercept her on her return.2 The first enterprise of the regents was against the Earl of Athole, who proudly lorded it over the heredi tary estates of the Steward, and whose immense pos sessions, both in Scotland and England, rendered him by far the most formidable of their enemies.2 Morav, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 320. - Douglas' Peerage, vol. i. p. 133."], [81, "1334. DAVID II. 45 by a rapid march into the north, attacked the Earl before he had time to assemble any considerable force, drove him into the wild district of Lochaber, and compelled him to surrender. Thus, by the over throw of Beaumont, Talbot, and Athole, the most powerful branch in the confederacy of the disinheri ted barons was entirely destroyed ; and Baliol, once more a fugitive, passed into England, and implored the protection and assistance of Edward. On being informed of the revolution in Scotland, the English king, although it was now the middle of November, determined upon a winter campaign, and issued writs for the attendance of his military vassals. The expedition, however, proved so unpopu lar, that no less than fifty-seven of the barons who owed suit and service, absented themselves ;' and, with an army enfeebled by desertion, Edward made his progress into Lothian, where, without meeting with an enemy, if we except some obscure malefac tors who were taken and executed, he ruled over a country which the Scots, following the advice of Bruce, abandoned for the time to his undisturbed do minion.2 Baliol, as usual, accompanied Edward, and with a portion of his army ravaged Avondale, and laid waste the districts of Carrick and Cunning hame. The vassal king then passed to Renfrew, and affected a royal state in his Christmas festivities, dis tributing lands and castles to his retainers, and com mitting the chief management of his affairs to Wil liam Ballock, a warlike ecclesiastic, whom he created 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 8.

From its insular situation this proved a matter of difficulty. A fort however was built in the church yard of Kinross, on a neck of land nearest to the cas tle, and from this frequent boat attacks were made, in all of which the besiegers were repulsed. At last Alan Vipont, the Scottish governor, seizing the op portunity when Strivelin was absent on a religious pilgrimage to the shrine of St Margaret at Dunferm line, attacked and carried the fort, put part of the English garrison to the sword, and raised the siege. He then returned to the castle with his boats laden with arblasts, bows, and other instruments of war,2 besides much booty, and many prisoners. Encouraged by this success, and anxious to en gage in a systematic plan of military operations, the Scottish regents summoned a parliament to meet at Dairsay. It was attended by Sir Andrew Moray, the Earl of Athole, the Knight of Liddesdale, lately returned from captivity, the Earl of March, who had embraced the party of David Bruce, and renounced his allegiance to Edward, Alexander de 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 177. 2 Winton, b. 8. c. 29. vol. ii. p. 183.

At a mo ment when unanimity was of infinite importance in the national councils, the ambition and overween ing pride of the Earl of Athole embroiled the de liberations, and kindled animosities amongst the leaders. His motives are not easily discovered. It is probable, that as he became convinced that Baliol would never be suffered to reign in Scotland, his own claims to the crown became uppermost in his mind, and that he was induced to renounce the allegiance which he had sworn to Edward, in the hope, that if Baliol were set aside, he might have a chance, amid the confusions of war, to find his way to the throne. He appeared accordingly at the parliament with a state and train of attendants almost kingly ; and, ha ving gained an ascendency over the young Steward, treated Moray and Douglas with such haughtiness, that the assembly became disturbed by mutual ani mosities and heart-burnings among the barons, and at length broke up in great confusion.1 Ambassadors soon after this arrived in England from Philip of France, earnestly recommending a cessation of hosti lities between his ancient allies the Scots, and the king of England ; but Edward, intent upon his scheme of conquest, although he consented to a short truce, continued his warlike preparations, and, despising all mediation, determined again to invade Scotland, and dictate the terms not of peace, but of absolute sub mission. About midsummer, the English king, accompanied 1 Fordun a Goodal, b. 13. cap. 24. vol. ii. p. 317."], [84, "1335. 48 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by\" Baliol, joined his army at Newcastle, having along with him the Earl of Juliers, with Henry Count of Montbellegarde, and a large band of foreign merce naries.1 Meanwhile, his fleet, anticipating the move ments of the land forces, entered the firth of Forth, and while Edward, with one part of his army, ad vanced by Carlisle into Scotland, Baliol, having along with him those English barons upon whom he had bestowed estates, and assisted by a numerous body of Welsh soldiers, remarkable for their ferocious man ners, proceeded from Berwick. But, notwithstand ing the great preparations, the campaign was one of little interest. Having penetrated to Glasgow, the two kings united their forces, and advanced to Perth without meeting an enemy. By an order of the regents, the Scots drove their cattle and removed their goods from the plain country, to wild and inaccessible fastnesses among the mountains, so that the English only wasted, a country already de serted by its inhabitants.2 They did not, however, entirely escape molestation ; for the Scottish barons, although too prudent to oppose them in a pitched field, hovered round their line of march, and more than once caught them at a disadvantage, suddenly as saulting them from some concealed glen or ambush, and cutting off large bodies who had separated them selves from the main army. In this way, a body of five hundred archers were attacked and cut to pieces by Moray the regent, and Sir William Dou glas.3 On another occasion, the Earls of March 1 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 555. \u25a0 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p 1025. 3 Knighton, p. 2567."], [85, "1335.

The two parties met on the Borough Muir ; for the foreign troops, imagining that the country was wholly in possession of the English, had advan ced fearlessly towards Edinburgh. The mercenaries, however, clad in complete steel, and strongly mount ed, made a desperate defence ; nor was it till the ap pearance of the Knight of Liddesdale with a rein forcement, that they found themselves compelled to retreat into the town. Confined within the streets and lanes, the conflict now changed into a series of single combats ; and it is interesting to remark the warm spirit of chivalry which diffuses itself into the details of our ancient historians, in their descriptions of this event. They dwell with much complacency on a famous stroke made by Sir David de Annand, a Scottish knight, who, enraged by a wound from one of the mercenaries, raised himself in his stirrups, and wielding a ponderous battle-axe with both hands, hewed down his opponent with such force, that the weapon cut sheer through man and horse, and was only arrested by the stone pavement, where the mark of the blow was shown in the time of the historian. ' The foreign soldiers were at last driven up the High street to the castle.2 This fortress had been disman tled, but Namiu* and his knights took their stand on the rock, and having killed their horses, piled their bodies into a mound, behind which they for a while 1 Extractaex Chronicis Scoti\u00e6, folio, 197.

They were at last compesied to surrender ; and Moray and Douglas treated their noble prisoner, who was near kinsman to their asiy the King of France, with chivalrous generosity.1 He and his brother knights and soldiers were set at li berty without ransom, and their captors accompanied them with an escort across the English border. This act of courtesy cost Moray very dear. On his return, his little party was attacked by the English, under William de Pressen, warden of Jedburgh Forest,2 and entirely routed. The regent was taken prisoner and instantly ironed and shut up in the strong castle of Bamburgh ; Douglas, however, had the good fortune to escape a second captivity in England, but his bro ther James Douglas was slain.2 From Perth, Edward and Baliol made a destructive progress through the north of Scotland, and soon af ter the Earl of Cornwall, brother to the King of Eng land, along with Sir Anthony Lucy, ravaged the western district of the kingdom, not even sparing the religious houses, but rasing the churches to the ground, and burning along with them the unhappy wretches who had there taken sanctuary. After this he marched to Perth, and joined his forces to those of the king, who had returned from his northern ex pedition.3 At this melancholy crisis, when, to use an expres sion of an ancient historian, none but children in their 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1026. 2 Winton, vol. ii. p. 194. 3 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 323."], [87, "1335. DAVID II. 51 games dared to call David Bruce their king,1 the Earl of Athole showed his versatile and selfish cha racter. The captivity of Moray the regent had deli vered him from a formidable opponent, and the young Steward unfortunately continued to be swayed by his opinion. Athole's ambition now prompted him to as pire to the vacant office of regent, for the purpose, as was shown by the result, of gratifying his rapacity and his revenge. He accordingly informed Edward, that he and his friends were willing to make their final submission, and he dispatched five deputies, who concluded a treaty at Perth, in which the English monarch agreed, that \" the Earl of Athole, and all other Scottish barons who came under his peace, should receive a free pardon, and have their estates in Scotland secured.\"2 By another article, the large English estates of this powerful baron were restored to him ; and to give a colour of public zeal to an agreement essentially selfish, it was stipulated that the franchises of the Scottish church, and the ancient laws of Scotland, should be preserved as they existed in the reign of Alexander the Third.3 As the price of this pacification, Athole was immediately appoint ed governor in Scotland under Baliol ; and Edward, having repaired the fortifications of Perth, and re built the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling, returned to England. 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 184. 2 Knighton, p. 2566.

Anxious to distinguish himself in the service of his new master, Athole now began to slay and im prison the friends of Bruce, and to seize and confis cate their estates, with a cruelty and rapacity which filled the hearts of the people with the most eager desire of vengeance.1 Nor was this long of being gratified. The handful of brave men, who still ob stinately supported their independence, chose for their leader Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, in early life the pupil of Wallace, a soldier of veteran experi ence, and of undoubted integrity. Moray did not long remain inactive, and his first enterprise was eminently successful. It happened, that within Kil drummie, a strong castle in the north, his wife, a noble matron, and sister of Robert Bruce, had taken refuge during the insolent administration of Athole, who, eager to make himself master of so valuable a captive, instantly attacked it. Moray as hastily collect ed a small army, and burning with a resentment which was kindled by a sense both of public and private wrongs, flew to raise the siege : he was accompanied by the Knight of Liddesdale and the Earl of March. Their troops encountered those of Athole in the Fo rest of Kilblene, and, after a short resistance, entirely dispersed them : Athole himself, with five knights who attended him, was slain in the wood.2 He died young in years, but old in political intrigue and am- 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1026. 2 Winton, b. 8. cap. 31. vol. ii. p. 201.

In solent and unsteady, he yet possessed, from his im mense estates and noble birth, a great capacity of doing mischief; and not only his last agreement with Edward, but the indiscriminate cruelty, with which he was at that moment hunting down the few re maining friends of liberty, rendered his death, at this crisis, little less than a public benefit. It was fol lowed by the election of Sir Andrew Moray to the regency of the kingdom, in a parliament held at Dunfermline.1 It might have been evident to Edward, long before this, that although it was easy for him to overrun Scotland, and destroy the country by the immense military power which he possessed, yet the nation it self was farther than ever from being subdued. The Scots were strong in their love of liberty, and in their detestation of Baliol, whom they now regarded with the bitterest feelings of contempt. It was true, in deed, that many of their highest nobles, swayed by private ambition, did not hesitate to sacrifice their country to the lust of power ; yet, amongst the ba rons and gentry, there was always a remnant left, who were animated by better feelings, and kept up the spirit of resistance against the power of England. This was remarkably shown in the history of the present period. The death of Athole was followed by the re-appearance of Edward in Scotland, at the head 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1 028."], [90, "54 1335. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of a formidable army, which was strengthened by the accession of the Anglicized Scottish barons and their numerous vassals. Alarmed at the declaration, now openly made by the French king, of his intention to assist his ancient allies,1 and prompted by the restless desire, so often formed, and so constantly defeated, of completing the subjugation of the country, the Eng lish monarch penetrated first to Perth, and afterwards into the more northern parts of the kingdom. His march was, as usual, marked by the utter destruction of the country through which it lay. The counties of Aberdeen, Nairn, and Inverness, with their towns and villages, were wasted by fire and sword, but he in vain endeavoured to bring the regent, Sir Andrew Moray, to a battle.2 Under the command of this ve teran leader, the Scots, intimately acquainted with the country, were ever near their enemy, and yet al ways invisible to them ; and an anecdote of a mas terly retreat, made during this northern campaign, has been preserved, which is strikingly characteris tic of the cool discipline of Moray. On one occa sion, word being brought to Edward that the re gent was encamped in the wood of Stronkaltere,3 he instantly marched against him. The intelligence was found to be true ; the English and Scottish outposts came in sight of each other, in a winding 1 Rymer, vol. iv. pp. 704, 705, 706. 2 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1028. 3 The exact position of this ancient wood cannot now be dis covered.

The gene ral was then at mass, and, although the danger was imminent, none dared to interrupt him till the service was concluded. On being told that Edward and his army were at hand in the forest, he observed there was no need of haste ; and, when the squires brought him his horse, began quietly to adjust its furniture, and to see that the girths were tight and secure. When this was going on, the English every moment came nearer, and the Scottish knights around Moray show ed many signs of impatience. This, it may be imagi ned, was not lessened when one of the saddle-girths snapt as he buckled it ; and the regent, turning to an attendant, bade him bring a coffer from his baggage, from which he took a skin of leather, and sitting down leisurely on the bank, cut off a broad stripe, with which he mended the fracture. He then returned the box to its place, mounted his horse, arrayed his men in close column, and commenced his retreat in such order, that the English did not think it safe to attack him ; and having at last gained a narrow de file, he disappeared from their view without losing a man. \" I have heard,\" says Winton, \" from knights who were then present, that in all their life they never thought time to go so slow, as when their old com mander sat mending his horse furniture in the wood of Stronkaltere.\"1 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 204, 205."], [92, "1336. 56 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. The widow of Athole was, soon after this, shut up by the army of Moray in the Castle of Lochendorb : she was the daughter of Henry Beaumont, who, forgetful of the conditions under which he had obtained his freedom at Dundarg, had accompanied Edward into Scotland, and she now earnestly implored the king and her father, to have compassion on her infant and herself, and to raise the siege. It was an age in which the ordinary events of the day assumed a chivasi-ous and romantic character. A noble matron, in sorrow for the slaughter of her husband, beleaguered in a wild mountain fortress, and sending for succour to the King of England and his barons, is an incident exactly similar to that which we look for in Amadis or Pal- merin. Edward obeyed the call, and hastened to her rescue. On his approach, the regent again retired into the woods and morasses ; and the king, having freed the Countess from her threatened captivity, wasted with fire and sword the rich province of Moray. Un- able, however, to dislodge the Scottish commander from his strengths, he was at last compelled to leave the country, with the conviction that every forest or mountain-hold which he passed, afforded a shelter for his mortal enemies, who would reappear the instant he retreated. He endeavoured, however, more effec tually to overawe and keep down the spirit of resist ance, by having a powerful fleet in the firth of Forth, and on the eastern and western coasts of the king dom ;J and before he retired, he repaired and garri- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 318, 322."], [93, "1336.

He then left a reinforcement of troops with his army at Perth, intrusted the command to his brother, the Earl of Cornwall, and returned to England. On his departure, Sir Andrew Moray instantly appeared from his fastnesses. Sir William Douglas the Knight of Liddesdale, Sir William Keith, and other patriot barons, assembled their vassals ; and the castles of Dunotter, Kinclevin, and Laurieston, were wrested from the English, after which, according to Bruce's old practice, they were broken up and dis mantled.1 Soon after, the regent made himself master of the tower of Falkland and the castles of St An drews, Leuchars, and Bothwell, which he entirely rased and destroyed.2 A grievous famine, occasioned by the continued ra vages of war, and the cessation of all regular agricul tural labour, had for some time desolated Scotland ; and the regent, anxious to obtain subsistence for his army in the enemy's country, made various predatory expeditions into England.3 On his return, he reduced 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1030.

This event, however, belongs, I suspect, to a later year. 3 Fordun a Goodal; vol. ii. p. 324. Rotuli Scot. ii. Edward III. vol. i. p. 507."], [94, "1336.

They were encountered by William Douglas, the Knight of Liddesdale, near Crichton castle, and, after much hard fighting, were compelled to retire across the Tweed. But Douglas was grievously wounded, and his little army so crippled with the loss which he sustained, that Moray deemed it expedient to aban don the siege.1 During the whole of this obstinate war, the French King had never ceased to take a deep interest in the affairs of his ancient allies. Before David had been compelled to take refuge in his kingdom, he had sent him a seasonable present of a thousand pounds.2 By his earnest remonstrances he had succeeded in pro curing many truces in favour of the Scots ; and, as the breach between France and England gradually grew wider, the French ships had occasionally as sisted the Scottish privateers in infesting the Eng lish coast, and had supplied them with stores, arms, and warlike engines.3 Against these maritime at tacks, it was the policy of Edward to arm the ves sels of the petty sea-kings, who were lords of the nu merous islands with which the western sea is stud- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 932.

But his efforts in the Scot tish war began at length to languish ; occupied with his schemes of continental ambition, he found him self unable to continue hostilities with his usual en ergy ; and, after four successive campaigns in Scot land, which he had conducted ist person, at the head of armies, infinitely more numerous than any which could be brought against them, he had the morti fication to discover, that the final conquest of that country was as remote as ever. He now endea voured to gain time, by amusing the Scots with the hopes of a general peace ; but the barons who led the opposition against England were well informed of the approaching rupture with France, and, aware that the opportunity was favourable for the entire expul sion of the English, they rejected all overtures for a pacification, and pushed on the war with vigour. The event showed the wisdom of such conduct; for the English monarch had advanced too far in his quarrel with Philip to withdraw, or even postpone, his pretensions, and to the great joy of the Scots, war between the two countries was declared, by Ed ward making his public claim to the crown of France on the 7th of October 1337.2 The Earls of Arundel, Salisbury, and Norfolk, 1 Rymer F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 711.

His wife was a daughter of the famous Randolph Earl of Moray, and with the heroic spirit of her family, this lady undertook the defence of the castle. For five months, in the absence of her lord, Black Agnes of Dunbar, as she was called by the vulgar from her dark com- plexion, maintained an intrepid stand against the as- sault of the English army, and with many fierce witticisms derided them from the walls. When the stones from the engines of the besiegers struck upon the battlements, she directed one of her maidens to wipe off the dust with a white napkin, a species of female defiance which greatly annoyed the Eng- lish soldiers. Perpetually on the ramparts, or at the gate, she exposed her person in every situation of danger, directing the men-at-arms and the archers, and extorting even the praise of her enemies by her determined and warlike bearing. It happened that an arrow from one of the Scottish archers struck an English knight, who stood beside the Earl of Salis bury, through his surcoat, and piercing the haber geon, or chained mail-coat, which was below it, made 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 325. 2 Winton, vol. ii. p. 208."], [97, "61 1337- DAVID II. its way through three plies of the acton which he wore next his body, and killed him on the spot, \u2014 \" There,\" cried Salisbury, \" comes one of my lady's tire-pins : Agnes's love shafts go straight to the heart.\" At length, the English, foiled in every assault, and finding that the strength of the walls defied the ef forts of their battering engines, judged it necessary to convert the siege into a blockade. This had near ly succeeded. A strong fleet, amongst which were two large Genoese ships, entirely obstructed all com munication by sea, and the garrison began to suffer dreadfully from want of provisions, when Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie sailed with a light vessel, at the dead of night, from the Bass. Favoured by the darkness, he passed unobserved through the line of the enemy's fleet, and ran his ship, laden with provi sions, and with forty stout soldiers on board, close under the wall of the castle next the sea. This last success deprived Arundel and Salisbury of their only hope of making themselves masters of this important fortress ; and mortified by repeated failure, they with drew the army, and retired with the disgrace of ha ving been foiled for five months, and at last entirely defeated, by a woman.1 Edward now began to experience the distress which the expense of a double war, and the necessity of maintaining an army both in France and Scotland, necessarily entasied upon him.

Edin burgh, Perth, Stirling, Cupar, and Roxburgh, were still in their hands, and the king commanded very large supplies of provisions to be levied upon his English subjects, and transported into Scotland ; but this occasioned grievous discontent, and in some cases the commissaries were attacked and plundered.1 Nor even when the supplies were procured, was it an easy matter to carry them to their destination ; for the Scots watched their opportunity, and became ad mirably expert in cutting off convoys, and assaulting foraging parties ; so that the war, without any action of great consequence, became occupied by perpetual skirmishes, concluding with various success, but chiefly on the side of the Scots. Sir Wisiiam Douglas, the Knight of Liddesdale, whose bravery procured him the title of the Flower of Chivalry, expelled the Eng lish from Teviotdale ; overpowered and took prisoner Sir John Stirling at the head of five hundred men-at arms ; intercepted a rich convoy near Melrose as it proceeded to the castle of Hermitage, which he soon after reduced ; attacked and defeated Sir Roland de Vaux ; and totally routed Sir Laurence Abernethy, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 12 Ed.

Some of these throw a strong light on the manners of the times. Henry de Lancaster, Earl of Derby, with great courtesy,sent a herald to request the Knight of Liddesdale to run with him three courses ; but in the first Douglas was deeply wounded, by a splinter of his own lance, in the hand, and compelled to give up the contest. The English earl now en- treated Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie to hold a solemn jousting for three days at Berwick, twenty against twenty; a proposition which was instantly ac- cepted, but it turned out a sanguinary pastime. Two English knights were slain; and Sir William Ramsay was struck through the bars of his aventaile by a spear, which penetrated so deep, that it was deemed certain he would expire the moment it was extracted. He was confessed therefore in his armour ; and as the knights crowded round, \" So help me, Heaven,\" said Derby, who stood hard by, \" I would desire to see no fairer sight than this brave baron thus shrieved with his helmet on ; happy man should I be, could I ensure myself such an ending.\" Upon this, Sir Alexander Ramsay placed his foot upon his kinsman's helmet, 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 329."], [100, "64 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1338. and by main force pulled out the broken truncheon, when the wounded knight started on his feet, and declared he should soon ail nothing. He died, how ever, immediately in the lists.1 \" What stout hearts these men have !\" was Derby's observation ; and with this laconic remark the jousting concluded. On another occasion, Sir Patrick de Graham, a Scot tish knight of high reputation, having arrived from France, Lord Richard Talbot begged to have a joust with him, and was borne out of his saddle and wounded, though not dangerously, through his ha bergeon. Graham was then invited to supper ; and in the midst of the feast, a stout English knight, turning to him, courteously asked him to run him three courses. \" Sir knight,\" replied Graham, \" if you would joust with me, I advise you to rise early and confess, after which you will soon be delivered.\" This was said in mirth, but it proved true ; for in the first course, which took place next morning, Graham struck the English knight through the harness with a mortal wound, so that he died on the spot.2 Such were the fierce pastimes of those days of dan ger and blood. On resuming the war, the tide of success still continued with the Scots, and Sir Alex der Ramsay rivalled and almost surpassed the fame of the Knight of Liddesdale. At the head of a strong band of soldiers, he infested the rocky and wooded banks of the Esk ; and concealing himself, his follow ers, and his booty, in the caves of Hawthornden, sal- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 329.

In these expe ditions his fame became so great, that there was not a noble youth in the land who considered his mili tary education complete, unless he had served in the school of this brave captain.1 On one occasion he was pursued and intercepted by the lords marchers in a plain near Werk castle ; but Ramsay attacked, and totally routed the marchers, took Lord Robert Manners prisoner, and put many to the sword.2 About this time Scotland lost one of its ablest sup porters. Sir Andrew Moray the regent, sinking un der the weight of age, and worn out by the constant fatigues of war, retired to his castle at Avoch, in Ross, where he soon after died, upon which the High Steward was chosen sole governor of Scotland. Moray, in very early life, had been chosen by Wallace as his partner in command, and his future military career was not unworthy of that great leader. His charac ter, as it is given by Winton, possesses the high merit of having been taken from the lips of those who had served under him, and knew him best. He was, says he, a lord of great bounty, of sober and chaste life, wise and upright in council, liberal and generous, devout and charitable, stout, hardy, and of great courage.3 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 333. 2 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 333.

He was endowed with that cool, and somewhat stern and inflexible character of mind, which peculiarly fit ted him to control the fierce temper of the feudal nobi lity, at a period when the task was especially difficult ; and it may be added, that, when the bravest, despairing for their country, had saved their estates by the sa crifice of its independence, Moray scorned to follow such examples, and appears never to have sworn fealty to any king of England. He was buried in the little chapel of Rosmartin ; but his body was af terwards raised and carried to Dunfermsine, where it now mingles with the heroic dust of Bruce and Ran dolph.1 The first act of the Steward was to dispatch the Knight of Liddesdale upon a mission to the court of France, to communicate with King Philip, and to procure assistance. He then assembled his army, and with his knights and barons commenced the siege of Perth, upon the fortifications of which the English, considering it a station of the first import ance, had expended vast sums of money. Mean while Baliol, universally hated by his countrymen, became an object of suspicion to the English, and leaving Perth, in obedience to the orders of Edward, retired, a pensioned dependent, into England. Ught red, a baron who had risen to high command in the Scottish war, undertook its defence, and for ten weeks the town resisted every effort of the besiegers ; so that the army of the Steward began to lose heart, 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1032."], [103, "1339.

This squadron was commanded by Hugh Haut pile, a daring and skilful naval officer, and had on board a strong party of men-at-arms, under the leading of Arnold Audineham, afterwards a mare schal of France,1 the Lord of Garencieres, who had formerly been engaged in the Scottish wars, and two brave esquires, Giles de la Huse and John de Bracy. Along with them came the Knight of Liddesdale ; and immediately, all idea of relinquishing the siege being abandoned, hostilities recommenced, by the French ships seizing the English victualling vessels, and ef fectually cutting off every supply from the garrison. At this time William Bullock, Baliol's chancellor, who commanded in the strong castle of Cupar, which had baffled the attack of the late regent, betrayed his master, and joined the army before Perth. This military ecclesiastic was one of those extraordinary individuals, whom the troubled times of war and ci vil disorder so frequently call out from the quiet track, to which more ordinary life would have con fined them. His talents for state affairs and for po litical intrigue were very great ; yet it is said that his ability in these matters was exceeded by his uncom mon genius for war ; and we shall not wonder that, in such times, the combination of these qualities made him to be dreaded and courted by all parties. 1 Froissart par Buchon, vol. i. p. 211.

In addition to this, he was ambitious, selfish, and fond of money, passions which could not be gratified if he continued to prop a falling cause. According- ly, the arrival of the French auxiliaries, the deser- tion of Scotland by Baliol, with the bribe of an am- ple grant of lands,1 induced him to renounce the Eng- lish asiiance, and deliver up the strong castle of Cu- par, where he commanded. He then joined the army besieging Perth, and his great military experience was soon shown, by the success of the operations which he directed. Although the Knight of Liddes- dale was grievously wounded by a javelin, thrown from one of the springalds, and the two captains of the Scottish archers slain, yet Bullock insisted in con- tinuing and pressing on the siege ;- and the Earl of Ross, with a body of miners, contrived to make a subterranean excavation under the walls, by which he drew off the water from the fosse surrounding the town, and rendered an assault more practicable. The minuteness of one of our ancient chronicles has pre- served a striking circumstance which occurred du ring the siege. In the midst of the military opera tions the sun became suddenly eclipsed, and, as dark ness gradually spread over all things, the soldiers of both armies forgot their duties, and sinking under the influence of superstitious terror, gazed fearfully on 1 It must have been ample, for Bullock renounced a considerable property conferred on him by Edward.

The soldiers of the garrison and the governor Ughtred were instantly shipped off for England, where his conduct became the subject of parliamentary inquiry.2 Thus master of Perth, the Steward, according to the wise policy of Bruce, cast down the fortifications,3 and proceeded to the siege of Stirling. It is difficult to imagine a more lamentable pic ture than that presented by the utter desolation of Scotland at this period. The famine, which had been felt for some years, now raged in the land. Many of the Scots had quitted their country in de spair, and taken refuge in Flanders ; others, of the poorer sort, were driven into the woods, and, in the extremities of hunger, feeding like swine upon the raw nuts and acorns which they gathered, were seized with diseases which carried them off in great agony.4 The continued miseries of war reduced the country round Perth to the state of a desert, where there was 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 234. 2 F\u0153dera, vol. v. p. 131. 3 Winton, vol. ii. p. 236. 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 324.

It is even said, that some unhappy wretches were driven to such ex tremities of want and misery, as to prey upon human flesh ; and that a horrid being, vulgarly called Cris ticleik, from the iron hook with which he seized his victims, took up his abode in the mountains, and, assisted by a ferocious female, with whom he sived, lay in ambush for the travellers who passed near his den, and methodically exercised the trade of a canni bal.1 The story is perhaps too dreadful for belief, yet Winton, who relates it, is in no respect given to the marvellous ; and a similar event is recorded as late as the reign of James the Second. In the midst of this complicated national distress, the Steward continued to prosecute the siege of Stir ling with the utmost vigour and ability ; and Rokes bury the governor, after a long and gallant defence, was at last compelled by famine to give up the castle, which, being found too strong in its mason work and bastions to be easily dismantled, was intrusted to the keeping of Maurice of Moray, a baron of great power and vassalage.2 In this siege, the Scots had to lament 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 236.

As he mounted the ladder in complete armour, he was struck down by a stone thrown from the ram parts, and, falling heavily and awkwardly, was thrust through by his own spear.1 It is related by Frois sart, that the Scots made use of cannon at the siege of Stirling ; but the fact is not corroborated by the contemporary Scottish historians. Scotland had of late years suffered grievously from famine, and had owed its support, more to provisions surreptitiously imported from England, contrary to the repeated proclamations of the king, than to the fruits of her own industry.2 But the exertions of the High Steward and his fellow soldiers, Douglas and Ramsay, had now expelled the English armies from nearly the whole country ; the castles of Edinburgh, Jedburgh, Lochmaben, and Roxburgh, with some inferior strengths in their vicinity, were all that re mained in the hands of Edward ; and the regent seized a short interval of peace to make a progress through the country, for the re-establishment of or der, and the distribution of justice.3 The good effects of this were soon observable in the gradual revival of regular industry : to use the strong language of Bower, the kingdom began to breathe anew, hus- siege is uncertain, but it seems to have been interrupted by an ar mistice. \u2014 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1031, asserts, that Sir- William Keith was slain at the siege of Stirling in 1337 ; but the date is an error. - W'inton, vol. ii. p. 237. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 541. 3 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 331, 332."], [108, "72 1341. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. bandmen once more were seen at the plough, and priests at the altar; but the breathing time which was asiowed, proved too short to give permanency to these changes. War suddenly recommenced with great fury ; and the castle of Edinburgh, commanded by Limosin, an English knight, fell into the hands of the enemy. The Scots owed the possession of this fortress to a stratagem of Bullock, the late governor of Cupar, which was executed with great address and boldness by the Knight of Liddesdale. The castle was strongly fortified both by art and nature ; and, as its garrison scoured and commanded the country round, they gave great annoyance to the Scots. Douglas, who lurked in the neighbour hood with two hundred soldiers, procured Walter Curry, a merchantman of Dundee,1 to run his ship into the Forth, under pretence of being an English victualling vessel, and to make an offer to supply the garrison with wine and corn. The device succeeded ; and the porter, without suspicion, opened the outer gate and lowered the drawbridge to the waggons and hampers of the pretended merchant and his drivers, who, throwing off the grey frocks which covered their armour, stabbed the warder in an instant, and sounded a horn, which casied up Douglas and his men from their ambush at the foot of the hill. All this could not be so rapidly executed, but that the cry of 1 Curry seems to have been assisted by another person, named William Fairley.

DAVID II. 73 treason alarmed the governor ; and the soldiers arm ing in haste, and crowding to the gates, began a des perate conflict. The waggons, however, had been so dexterously placed, that it became impossible to let down the portcullis ; and Douglas rushing in with his men, soon decided the affair. Of the garrison, only the governor, Limosin, and six esquires, esca ped ;l the rest were put to the sword, and the com mand of the castle was intrusted to a natural brother of the Knight of Liddesdale. There are two particulars regarding this spirited enterprise, which are curious and worthy of remark. Curry was a Scotsman, yet it seems he found no dif ficulty in introducing himself as an English mer chant, from which there arises a strong presumption, that the languages spoken in both countries were nearly the same ; and both he and his followers, be fore they engaged in the enterprise, took the precau tion of shaving their beards, a proof that the Norman fashion of wearing no beard, had not been adopted in Scotland in the fourteenth century.2 Soon after this success, the regent and the estates of Scotland, considering the kingdom to be now al most cleared of their enemies, sent a solemn embassy to France, requesting that their youthful sovereign would return to his dominions. David accordingly, who had now for nine years been an exile in a fo reign land, embarked with his queen ; and, although 1 Froissart, vol. i. p. 359. Edition de Buchon. 2 Winton, vol.ii. pp. 240, 243.

Indeed, the circumstances in which he found the country upon his arrival, were such as, to manage successfully, required a union of prudence and firmness, which could scarcely be expected in a youthful sovereign. In the minority which had ta ken place since the death of Bruce, and in the absence of the name and power of a king, a race of fierce and independent barons had grown up, who ruled at will over their own vast estates, and despised the authority of the laws. Between the king and the Steward of Scotland, who now laid down his office of regent, there does not appear to have been any very cordial feelings ; and it is probable that David never forgot the conspiracy of Athole in 1334, by which this fickle and ambitious baron, and the Steward, then a very 1 Fordun a. Goodal, vol. ii. p. 334. WTinton, vol. ii. p. 250."], [111, "1342. DAVID II. 75 young man, acknowledged Baliol, and made their peace with Edward. Athole indeed was slain, and the subsequent conduct of the Steward had been con sistent and patriotic ; but the king could not fail to regard him with that natural jealousy, which a mo narch, without children, is apt to feel towards the person whom the parliament had declared his suc cessor, and who had already, on one occasion, shown so little regard for his allegiance. As for the other powerful barons, the Knight of Liddesdale, his kinsman Lord William Douglas, the Earl of Moray, Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie, and Bullock, who soon after became chamberlain, they appear indeed to have been unanimous in their opposition to England, and so far could be trusted ; but a long experience of military power, without the habit of acknowledging a superior, made them impa tient of the control of a superior, and rendered it almost impossible for a sovereign so to parcel out and confer his favours amongst them, as not to excite jealousy, and sow the seed of very fatal dissensions. All this, in a short time, became apparent ; and a thoughtless measure, which the youthful monarch adopted very soon after his arrival, evinced his ignorance and want of judgment in a very fatal manner. Sir Alex ander Ramsay of Dalhousie had eminently distin guished himself in the Scottish wars, and was univer sally beloved in the country for his brave and patriotic qualities. Scarcely had the young king arrived in his dominions, when word was brought him, that Rox burgh Castle, a fortress of great strength and import-"], [112, "1342. 76 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ance, had been taken in a night escalade by this baron, upon whom, in the first ardour of his gratitude, Da vid instantly conferred the government of the place, and along with it the sheriffship of Teviotdale.1 This act of generosity originated in ignorance, but it bore the appearance of injustice, and it proved a fatal present ; for the Knight of Liddesdale then held the office of sheriff, and a fierce and deadly enmity arose in the breast of Douglas against Ramsay, his old companion in arms. His way of revenging him self, affords a melancholy proof of the lawless inde pendence of these feudal nobles, as well as of the treachery of Douglas's disposition. He first pretend ed to be reconciled to Ramsay ; and, having silenced all suspicion by treating him with his usual friend ship, he led a band of armed soldiers to Hawick, where he knew that the new sheriff held his court in the open church. It is said that Ramsay was warn ed of his intention, but, trusting to the reconciliation which had taken place, generously descredited the story. On Douglas entering the church, Ramsay in vited him to take his place beside him ; on which that fierce baron drew his sword, seized his victim, who was wounded in attempting a vain resistance, and throw ing him bleeding across a horse, carried him off to his castle of Hermitage, where he thrust him into a dungeon. It happened that there was a granary above his prison, and some particles of corn fell through the chinks and crevices of the floor, upon which he 1 Winton, voL ii. p. 252."], [113, "1342. DAVID II. 77 supported a miserable existence for seventeen days, and at last died of hunger.1 It is a melancholy reflection, that a fate so horrid be fell one of the bravest and most popular leaders of the Scottish nation ; and that the deed did not only pass unrevenged, but that its perpetrator received a speedy pardon, and was rewarded by the very office which had led to the murder. Douglas became governor of Roxburgh castle, sheriff of Teviotdale, and protec tor of the middle marches. He owed his pardon and preferment to the intercession of the High Steward of Scotland. In attempting to form an estimate of the manners of the age, it ought not to be forgotten, that this cruel and aggravated murder was perpetrated by a person, who, for his knightly qualities, was styled the \" Flower of Chivalry.\" It was an invariable ef fect of the principle of vassalage in the feudal sys tem, that the slaughter of any of the greater barons rendered it an imperative duty, in every one who fol lowed his banner, to revenge his death upon all who were in the most remote degree connected with it ; so that we are not to wonder that the assassination of Ramsay was followed by interminable feuds, dissen sions, and conspiracies, not only amongst the higher 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 254.

It was proba bly one of these plots, of which it is impossible now to detect the ramifications, that accelerated the fate of Bullock, the able and intriguing ecclesiastic renegade, who had deserted Baliol to join the king. Having become suspected by his master, he was suddenly strips of his honours, deprived of the high offices in which he had amassed immense wealth, and cast amongst the meanest criminals, into a dungeon of the castle of Lochendorb, in Moray, where he was starved to death. The probable truth seems to be, that Bul lock, a man of high talents, but in ambition and the love of intrigue not unlike Wolsey, had been tam pering with the English, and that his fate, though cruel, was not unmerited.1 The period immediately following the arrival of David in his dominions till we reach the battle of Dur ham, is undistinguished by any events of importance. The Scots, with various success, invaded and ravaged the border counties of England ; but a revolt of the Island chief, John of Argyle, and other northern ba rons,2 recalled the king's attention to the unsettled state of his affairs at home, and made him willing to accede to a two years' truce with England. This interval was employed by Edward in an attempt to seduce the Knight of Liddesdale from his allegiance ; and there seems reason to think that a conspiracy, at the head of which was this brave, but fierce and fickle, 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1035.

It may be that the sti pulated reward was not duly paid ; or, perhaps, the fate of Bullock was a timely warning to Douglas ; and anxious to wipe away all suspicion of treachery, the Knight of Liddesdale, regardless of the truce, broke across the Borders at the head of a numerous army, burnt Carlisle and Penrith, and after a skir mish with the English, in which the Bishop of Car lisle was unhorsed, retreated precipitately into Scot land. After this recommencement of hostilities, the mor tal antipathy between the two countries broke out with greater violence than before ; and the young king, believing Edward to be entirely occupied with his war on the Continent, and anxious to produce a 1 This may be inferred, I think, from the circumstance, that Bullock was seized by David de Berkelay, and Berkelay himself was, not long after, waylaid and assassinated by John de Saint Mi chael, at the instigation of the Knight of Liddesdale.

The Earl of Ross assassinated Ranald of the Isles in the monastery of Elcho, and dreading the royal vengeance, led his men back to their mountains ; a circumstance which, in those days of superstition, was interpreted by the rest of the army as a bad omen for the success of the expedi tion. In one respect it was worse than ominous. Not only Ross's men left the army, but the soldiers of the Isles, deprived of their head and leader, dis persed in confusion ; many of the inferior Highland lords, anxious for the preservation of their lands against the ravages which inevitably followed a dead ly feud, privately deserted the royal banner, and re turned home, so that the king found his forces greatly reduced in number. Inheriting, however, the bra very of his father, but, as the event showed, little of his admirable judgment and military skill, he pressed forward from Perth, and, after rapidly traversing the intervening country, on reaching the Border, sat down before the castle of Liddel, then commanded by Wal ter Selby. Selby was that fierce robber chief, whose 1 Walsingham, p. 165 and 516.

Since that time, he had lent himself to every party which could pur chase his sword at the highest rate, and had lately espoused the quarrel of Edward Baliol, from whom he received a grant of lands in Roxburghshire.1 Da vid brought his military engines to bear upon the walls, which, after six days' resistance, were demo lished.2 He then stormed the castle, put the garrison to the sword, and ordered Selby to instant execution. After this success, the veteran experience of the Knight of Liddesdale advised a retreat. Douglas was, no doubt, aware of the great strength of the northern English barons, and the overwhelming force which soon would be mustered against them ; but his salutary counsel was rejected by the youthful ardour of the king, and the jealousy of the Scottish nobles. \" You have filled,\" said they, \" your own coffers with English gold, and secured your own lands by our va lour ; and now you would restrain us from our share in the plunder, although the country is bare of fight ing men, and none but cowardly clerks and mean me chanics stand between us and a march to London.\"3 This, however, was a grievous mistake ; for, al though Edward, with the noble army which had been victors at Cressy, lay now before Calais, yet Ralph 1 Rotuli Scotia?, vol. i. p. 820. 2 Robert of Avesbury, p. 145. 3 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 340.

Nevil of Raby, the Lord Henry Percy, Edward Ba liol the ex-king of Scotland, the Earl of Angus, and the Border Lords Musgrave, Scrope, and Hastings, with many other barons, instantly summoned their strength to repel the invasion, and a body of ten thousand men, who were ready to embark for Calais, received counter-orders, and soon joined the muster. Besides this, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, with the Prelates of Durham, Carlisle, and Lincoln, assumed their temporal arms, and with such of their church troops and vassals as had not accompanied the king, assembled to defend the country, so that an army of thirty thousand men, including a large body of men-at-arms, and twenty thousand English arch ers,1 were speedily on their march against the Scots. David, meanwhile, advanced to Hexham, and for fourteen days plundered and laid waste the country, leaving his route to be traced through the bishoprick of Durham by the flames of villages and hamlets. It seems to have excited unwonted resentment and horror, that he did not spare even the sacred territory of St Cuthbert, although, if we may believe a monk ish historian, the venerable saint visited the slumbers of the king, and implored him to desist from the pro fanation. Satiated at length with plunder, the Scot tish army encamped at a place called Beaurepair, now Bear Park, within a short distance of Durham. By this time, the English army had taken up their ground in the park of Bishop Auckland, not six miles distant 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 260, 261.

It was a plain or common, much intersected with ditches and hedges, which separated the divisions, and hindered them from supporting each other ; and the country round was of that varied and undulated kind, that, unless the scouts were very active, an enemy might approach within a few miles without being discovered. This was, in truth, the very event which happened, and it gave melancholy proof that there were no longer such leaders as Bruce, or the Good Sir James, in the Scottish army. At break of day, the Knight of Liddesdale pushed on before the rest of the Scots. He led a strong squadron of heavy-armed cavalry, and, advancing for the purpose of forage through the grounds near Sunderland, suddenly found himself in presence of the whole English army. The proximity of the enemy rendered a retreat as hazard ous as a conflict ; yet Douglas attempted to retire ; but his squadron was overtaken, and driven back, with the loss of five hundred men, upon the main body of the Scots. David instantly drew up his army in three divi sions. He himself led the centre ; the right wing was intrusted to the Earl of Moray, while the Knight of Liddesdale, and the Steward, with the Earl of Dunbar, commanded the left. These dispositions were made in great haste and alarm, and scarcely completed, when the English archers had advanced almost with in bowshot.1 Sir John de Graham, an experienced soldier, at this moment rode up to the king, and ear- 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 261, 262."], [120, "1346. 84 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. nestly besought him to command the cavalry to charge the archers in flank. It was the same man\u0153uvre which had been so successful at Bannockburn, but from ignorance or youthful obstinacy, David was deaf to his advice. \" Give me,\" cried Graham, in an agony of impatience, as the fatal phalanx of the arch ers advanced nearer and nearer ; \" give me but a hundred horse, and I engage to disperse them all.\"1 Yet even this was unaccountably denied him, and the brave baron, seconded by none but his owrn followers, threw himself upon the bowmen ; but it was too late ; time had been given them to fix their arrows, and the deadly shower was sped. Graham's horse was shot under him, and he himself with difficulty escaped back to the army. It was now nine in the morning, and the whole English force had come up. A crucifix was carried in the front of the line, and around it waved innumera ble banners and pennons, gorgeously embroidered, and belonging chiefly to the church. The close battle now began, and under circumstances very discouraging to the Scots. The discharge of the archers had already greatly galled and distressed them, and the division commanded by the Earl of Moray was now fiercely attacked by the English men-at-arms. His array was broken and separated by the ditches and hedges which intersected the ground where he was stationed. These grievously impeded his movements, so that the 1 Winton, b. 8, c. 40, vol. ii. p. 262. Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 342."], [121, "1346. DAVID II. 85 English cavalry charged through the gaps in the line, and made a dreadful havoc. At last Moray fell, and his division was entirely routed. The English then attacked the main centre of the Scots, where David commanded in person : and as it also was drawn up in the same broken and enclosed ground, the various leaders and their vassals were separated, and fought at a serious disadvantage.1 Their flank, too, was ex posed to the discharge of a body of ten thousand English bowmen ; and, as the distance diminished, the arrows flying with a truer aim and more fatal strength, told fearfully against the Scots. Yet the battle raged for three hours with great slaughter ;2 and the yoUng king, although he had evinced little military judgment in the disposition of his army, fought with obstinate and determined valour. He was defended by a circle of his nobility, who fell fast around him. The Constable David de la Haye, Keith the Marshal, Charters the High Chancellor, and Peebles the Lord Chamberlain, with the Earls of Moray and Strathern, and thirty barons belonging to the principal families in Scotland, were slain. The king himself was grievously wounded by two arrows, one of which pierced deep, and could not be extracted without great agony. Yet he long continued to re sist and encourage the few that were left around him. An English knight named Copland, at last broke in upon him, and after a hard struggle, in which two of ' Winton, vol. ii. p. 263, 5 Ibid."], [122, "1346. 86 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. his teeth were knocked out by the king's dagger,1 succeeded in overpowering and disarming him. On the capture of the king, the High Steward and the Earl of March, whose division had not suffered so severely, judging, probably, that any attempt to restore the day wrould be hopeless, drew off their troops, and escaped from the field without much loss ;2 for the English were fortunately too much occupied in plunder and making prisoners, to engage in a pursuit which might have been very fatal. Amongst the prisoners, besides the king, were the Knight of Lid desdale, the Earls of Fife, Menteith, Sutherland, and Wigton, and fifty other barons and knights. It is not too high a computation, if we estimate the loss of the Scots in this fatal battle at fifteen thousand men.3 That of the English wus exceedingly small, if we con sider how long the conflict lasted. Froissart has as serted, that the English Queen Philippa was in the field, and harangued the troops, mounted on a white charger. The story is ridiculous, and is contradicted by all the contemporary historians, both English and Scottish. A defeat so calamitous had not been sustained by Scotland since the days of Edward the First. Their best officers were slain or taken, and their king a cap tive.

The conduct of the Steward, in preferring the dictates of prudence, perhaps of ambition, to the ge nerous feelings which would have led him to have sacrificed his life in an attempt to rescue the king, cannot be easily exculpated or defended. He and the Earl of March, with the third division of the army which was under their command, made good their retreat ; and their escape was ultimately fortunate for the country. But it excited a feeling of lasting per sonal resentment in the bosom of the king : it was 1 Knighton, p. 2592. 2 Rotuli Scot. 21 Ed.

Meanwhile, the consequences of the battle of Durham wrere bril liant to England, but not lasting or important. Roxburgh Castle, the key of the kingdom on the Borders, surrendered to Henry Percy and Ralph Ne ville, and the English overran the districts of Tweed dale, the Merse, Ettrick, Annandale, and Galloway.1 Availing themselves of the panic and confusion which ensued upon the captivity of the king, they pushed forward into Lothian, and boasted that the marches of the kingdom wrere from Coldbrandspeth to Sou tray, and from thence to Carlops and Crosscryne.2 Baliol, who had acted a principal part in these inva sions, now believed that the entire subjugation of Scot land, so long delayed, was at length to be accomplished, and the sceptre to be for ever wrested from the line of Bruce.

At the head of this army he overran the Lothians, scoured the country as far as Glasgow, wasted Cun ningham and Niddesdale, and rendered himself uni versally odious by the ferocity which marked his progress. At this time, Lionel, Duke of Ulster, the son of Edward the Third, became engaged in a mysterious transaction relative to the affairs in Scotland, upon which, unfortunately, no contemporary documents throw any satisfactory light. By an agreement, en tered into between this English prince and the Lords Henry Percy and Ralph Neville, these barons un dertook to assist Baliol with a certain force of men at-arms. Only the name of the treaty remains ; but, if a conjecture may be hazarded on so dark a subject, it seems probable that the ambition of Lionel began already to aspire to the crown of Scotland. Baliol was childless ; and the English Prince may have proffered him his assistance, under some implied con dition that he should adopt him as his successor. We know for certain, that on Baliol being for ever expelled from Scotland, Lionel engaged in the same political intrigue with David the Second.1 But, al- 1 Ayloffe's Ancient Charters, p. 299. \" Indentura tractatus inter Leonellum filium Edwardi tertii primogenitum, Comitem de Ulster, ex una parte, et Monsieur Henry Percy et Ranf.

The command of the castles, and the government of the counties, were intrusted to men of tried fidelity ; and to procure a breathing time, negotiations were set on foot for a truce. 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1039."], [127, "1346.

The persuasion in England seems to have been, that the battle of Dur ham, and the acquisition of the Border provinces, had decided the fate of Scotland as a conquered country. A conference upon the subject was ap pointed to be held at Westminster, to which were summoned the prelates and barons of the northern provinces ; an English justiciary was appointed for the new kingdom, and the Barons Lucy, Dacre, and Umfraville, were directed to accept the fealty of a people whom, with premature triumph, they believed ready to submit to the yoke of England.'

In him the Steward soon found an able assistant. Possessing the high military talents which seemed to have been then hereditary in the family, he soon expelled the English from Douglasdale, took possession of Ettrick Forest, and raising the men of Teviotdale, cleared that district from the invaders.1 Whilst such was the course of events in Scotland, the English king endeavoured to strike a panic into the few Scottish barons who remained to defend their country, by the trial of the Earls of Men teith and Fife, made prisoners at the battle of Dur ham. Both were found guilty of treason, on the ground of their having risen in arms against their liege lord, Edward the Third. Menteith was executed, and his quarters, in the savage spirit of the times, parcelled over the kingdom.2 The Earl of Fife, after condemnation, had his life spared, from his relation ship to Edward the First. These trials were followed by the seizure of all ecclesiastical lands in Scotland belonging to churchmen who were evilly disposed to England, by the resumption into the hands of the crown of all the estates in that country which had been given to English subjects, and by the imposi tion of additional duties on the commodities exported from Berwick.3 Edward's object in all this was, in 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 269, 270. 2 Rotuli Scot. vol. i. p. 689. 6th March, 1346-7; Ayloffe, p. 203. 3 Ibid. vol. i. p. 686."], [129, "1351.

But, fortunately for that country, a new war proved, at this conjuncture, highly unpopular amongst the English barons.1 Their sovereign, notwithstanding all his efforts, was distressed for money, and engrossed with his am bitious schemes in France. The desire of recruiting his coffers, by the high ransom which he knew must be paid for the Scottish king, and the many noble prisoners, taken at Durham, induced him to postpone his projected invasion of Scotland,2 and to enter into negotiations, which concluded in a truce.3 This ces sation of hostilities continued, by means of successive prolongations, for six years. But the liberty of the king was a matter of more difficult arrangement. After many conferences, which were protracted from year to year, the conditions demanded by Edward were refused by the Scots ; and David revisited his dominions only upon his parole, having left seven youths, of the noblest families in Scotland, as host ages for his return.4 During his captivity, a dreadful visitant had ap peared in his dominions, in the shape of a pestilence, more rapidly destructive than any hitherto known in modern times.

But the exemption was now at an end ; and, owing to whatever causes, the awful calamity fell with as deadly force on Scotland, as on any other part of Europe.2 Not long after David's return, a commissioner ar rived from Edward, who appears to have been in trusted with a secret and important communication to the King of Scotland and Lord William Douglas.3 Although, from the very brief and unsatisfactory do cument which notices this transaction, much mystery hangs over it, yet enough is discoverable to throw a deep shade upon the character of the Scottish king. Worn out by the prospect of a long captivity, render ed doubly bitter by his present taste of the sweets of liberty, he had agreed to sacrifice the independence of his kingdom to his desire of freedom ; and there yet remain in the chapter-house at Westminster two in struments, in which David recognises the King of England as his Lord Paramount, and consents to take the oaths of homage.4 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 347. 2 M'Pherson's Notes on Winton, vol. ii. p. 512.

But the prisoners of highest rank and importance wrere kept in durance, and amongst these the Knight of Liddes dale. This leader, deservedly illustrious by his mi litary talents and success, but cruel, selfish, and am bitious, was a second time seduced from his allegiance, and meanly agreed to purchase his liberty, at the expense of becoming a retainer of Edward.

But they were disappointed. Douglas pro ved the steady enemy of England ; and aware of the base game which had been played by Liddesdale, he defeated it by breaking into Galloway at the head of a powerful force, and compelling the wavering barons of that wild and unsettled district to renounce the English alliance, and to swear fealty to the Scot tish king.2 At the same time, Roger Kirkpatrick \u25a0wrested from the English the important castles of Carlaverock and Dalswinton, and preserved in its allegiance the territory of Niddesdale; whilst the regent of the kingdom, assisted by his son, after wards king, collected an army, and making his head-quarters in Annandale, where* disaffection had chiefly spread, contrived to keep that district in tran quillity. The intrigues of the Knight of Liddesdale were thus entirely defeated. He had hoped to make Annandale the central point from which he was to commence his attack upon the ancient independence 1 Knighton, p. 2603.

Since the death of the Good Sir James, the Dou glases had looked to the Knight of Liddesdale as their head, and the chief power of that family had centred in this baron. But the murder of Ramsay, his loose and fierce habits, and the stain thrown upon him by consenting to become the creature of England, all contributed to render him odious to his countrymen, and to raise, in bright opposition to his, the character of William, Earl of Douglas, his near kinsman. This seems to have excited a deadly enmity between them, and other circumstances con tributed to increase the feeling. The Earl of Dou glas had expelled the English from Liddesdale and Annandale, and was in possession of the large feu dal estates of the family. On the other hand, the Knight of Liddesdale, during his treasonable inter course with England, obtained a grant of Hermi tage Castle and the whole of Liddesdale from Ed ward ; nor was he of a temper to consent tamely to their occupation. These causes, increased, it is said, by a jealousy on the part of the Earl, who suspected his countess of a partiality for his rival, led to a very atrocious murder. As Liddesdale was hunting in Ettrick Forest, he was beset and cruelly slain by his kinsman, at a spot called Galford.1 The body 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1041. VOL. II. <;"], [134, "1353. 98 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. was carried to Lindin Kirk, a chapel in the Forest, not far from Selkirk, where it lay for some time. It was then transported to Melrose, and buried in that ancient abbey.1 The deed was a dark and atrocious one, and conveys a melancholy picture of the fierce and lawless state of Scotland ; but Liddesdale met with little sympathy. To gratify his own private revenge, he had been guilty of repeated murders, and his late treaty with Edward had cancelled all his former services to his country. Since the commencement of his captivity, David had now made three unsuccessful attempts to nego tiate for his liberty ;2 but many circumstances stood between him and freedom. The English king con tinued to confer on Baliol, who lived under his pro tection, the style of King of Scotland, and refused to David his royal titles ;3 and although it was evident that Edward's real intentions were to subdue Scot land for himself, while Baliol was merely employed as a tool to be thrown aside at pleasure, yet so long as his avowed purpose was the restoration of Baliol, there was a consistency in keeping his rival in du rance. On the other hand, whatever disposition 1 Hume's Douglas and Angus, vol. i. p. 143. Hume has quoted a single stanza of an old ballad, made on this mournful occasion.

The brilliant and commanding talents of Edward the Third had acquired a strong influence over his mind ; he had become attached to the country and manners of his enemies, and, in the absence of his queen, had formed a disgraceful connexion with a lady of the name of Mortimer. The return, therefore, of David, was an event rather to be deprecated, than desired, by the country. The Steward, with the barons of his party, dreaded not only the loss of his own personal consequence, and the establishment on the throne of a sovereign whom he knew to be his enemy ; but, what was still more intolerable, they saw in it the establishment of the superiority of England, and the vassalage of their own land. It is to this cause, as suredly, that we are to attribute the coldness and reluctance with which the negotiations proceeded. They were, however, at length concluded at New castle, in the month of July, 1354, by a treaty, in which David's ransom was fixed at ninety thousand marks, \u2014 an enormous sum for that period ; and it was stipulated, that this money was to be paid in nine years, at the rate of ten thousand marks annually.1 The commissioners who conducted the negotiations for this treaty, were, the Bishops of St Andrews and Brechin, along with Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. v. p. 791."], [136, "1355. 100 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. one of the few Scottish earls who had escaped capti- vity at the battle of Durham ; but, previous to its ratification, Eugene de Garencieres, who had already served in the Scottish wars, arrived upon a mis- sion from the court of France, at the head of a select body of sixty knights, and bringing with him a sea- sonable subsidy of French gold, in the shape of for- ty thousand moutons d'or, which were distributed by him amongst the Scottish nobles.1 The treaty of ransom had been especially unpopular with the pa- triotic party in Scotland, as the sum stipidated was far too heavy a drain upon the country. It had not yet received the consent of the regent, or the final ratification of the states of the realm ; and Garen- cieres found little difficulty in persuading them to give up all thoughts of peace, and to seize the ear- liest opportunity of recommencing hostilities. For the present, therefore, the King of Scotland, who had seen himself on the point of regaining his liberty, was remanded to the Tower, and an invasion of Eng land resolved on as soon as the truce expired.2 Yet the English themselves were the first aggressors in a Border inroad, in which they laid waste the exten sive possessions of the Earl of March.2 To revenge the insult, this nobleman, along with the Earl of Douglas, and a large body of men-at-arms, who were reinforced by the French knights and soldiers, under 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 271.

They then dispatched Sir William Ramsay of Dal wolsy, having four hundred men under his banner, to cross the Tweed, and plunder the village of Norham, and the adjacent country. It was the constant po licy of Edward to keep a strong garrison in Norham Castle. Its vicinity to the Borders made it one of the keys to England on the East Marches ; it was exposed to perpetual attacks, and, in consequence, be came the general rendezvous of the bravest and most stirring spirits in the English service. Ramsay exe cuted his task of destruction with unsparing fidelity ; and, in his retreat, took care to drive his booty past under the walls of the castle. The insult, as was expected, brought out the whole English garrison upon them, led by the constable, Sir Thomas Grey, and Sir James Dacre. After a short resistance, Ramsay fled to where the Scottish army lay con cealed ; and the English pursuing, suddenly found themselves, on turning round the shoulder of a moun tain, in presence of the well-known banners of Dou glas. Retreat was now impossible, and resistance almost equally fruitless, for Douglas greatly outnum bered the English ; but it was the age of chivalry, and the constable of Norham was a true disciple of the order.1 Forming his little band around him, he 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 276."], [138, "102 1355.

After the fight, there occurred a fierce trait of feudal vengeance. One of the French knights purchased some of their prisoners from the Scots, and, leading them to a re mote spot on the mountain, murdered them in cold blood, declaring that he did this to revenge the death of his father, who had been slain by the English in their wars in France.1 The city of Berwick, at this time in the hands of the English, and which had long been the emporium of the commerce of both kingdoms, became the next object of attack. It was too well fortified, however, to hold out the least chance of success to an open as sault ; but the Earls of Angus and March having collected a strong naval force, and favoured by a dark November night, ran their ships up the river as far as the tide permitted, where disembarking, they proceeded silently to the foot of the walls ; and, in the first dawn of the morning, stormed the town by escalade, slew the captain, Sir Alexander Ogle, 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 350.

Flushed with their success, and enrich ed with an immense booty, the Scots next attacked the castle ; its strength, however, resisted all their efforts ; and the regent arriving to inspect his con quest, found that it would be impossible to keep the town, if, as was to be anticipated, the garrison should be supported by an English army. In such circum stances, to have dismantled the fortifications, and abandoned the city, would have been the most politic course ; but, unwilling at once to renounce so high a prize, the Steward left in Berwick what troops he could spare, and retired. Little time, indeed, was given for the execution of any plan, for Edward, hearing of the successes of the Scots, hastened from Calais, staid only three days in his capital, and, attended by those veteran and experienced officers who had so well ser- 1 Fordun a Hearne, pp. 1044, 1045.

Edward and his guards imme diately took possession of the castle ; and, while Sir Walter Manny, a name which the siege of Calais has made famous, began a mine below the walls, the king determined to storm the town over the draw bridge, which was thrown from the castle to the Douglas Tower. Against these formidable prepara tions, the small force left by the Steward could not possibly contend ; and the garrison having capitu lated, with safety of life and limb, returned to Scot land, and abandoned the town to the enemy.2 That fated country now lay open to an army of eighty thousand men, commanded by the victor of Cressy. The English fleet was ordered, without delay, to sail round the coast, and await him in the Forth ; and the king, breathing threats and vengeance a gainst his enemies, and irritated that his career in France was perpetually checked and thwarted by his dangers at home, invaded Scotland, with a determi nation to destroy and utterly subdue the country.3 At first every thing seemed to favom* his project. 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. v. p. 828.

Fatal and virulent dissensions again broke out amongst the Scottish nobles, excited, no doubt, by the terror of confiscation and imprisonment, to which an unsuccess ful resistance to England necessarily subjected them ; and in addition to this, a very extraordinary event, which seemed ominous of success, occurred upon the arrival of Edward and his army at Roxburgh. It had undoubtedly been long in preparation ; and one branch of those secret negotiations which led to it, is probably to be seen in the mysterious treaty, already noticed, be tween Prince Lionel and Henry Percy, for the assist ance of Edward Baliol. That weak and unfortunate person now presented himself before Edward ; and, with all the feudal ceremonies becoming so solemn a transaction, for ever resigned his kingdom of Scotland into the hands of the English king, divesting himself of his regalia, and laying his golden crown at the feet of the monarch.1 His declared motives for this pusil lanimous conduct are enumerated in the various deeds and instruments which passed upon the occasion ; but the real causes of the transaction are not difficult to be discovered. It needed little penetration to discern, that the retention of the royal name and title by Ba liol stood in the way of the pacification of Scotland, and the negotiations for the ransom of the King, and 1 The English historian Knighton asserts that Baliol delivered all rio-ht which he possessed in the crown of Scotland to Lionel, the King's son.

Baliol himself was a mere dependent of Edward's. For the last sixteen years he had been supported by the money, and had lived under the protection, of England.1 He was now an old man ; and he could not entertain the slightest hope of subduing the country, which he still affected to consider as his own. In return for this surrender of his crown, Ed ward now agreed to settle upon him an annuity of two thousand pounds ; and, when commanded to strip himself of his unsubstantial honours, he at once obeyed his master, and sunk into the rank of a pri vate baron. During one part of his life, when he fought at Dupplin, and took part with the disinherit ed barons, he had shown a considerable talent for war ; but this last base act proved that he was un worthy of the throne, from which he had almost ex pelled the descendants of Bruce. He died, not many years after this event, in obscurity, and, fortunately for Scotland, without children. Meanwhile Edward, who had thus procured the donation of the kingdom from Baliol, and extorted the acknowledgment of homage from David, per- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 544, 546."], [143, "1355. DAVID II. 107 suading himself that he had a just quarrel, hastened his .varlike preparations, and determined to invade the country with a force, against which all resistance would be unavailing. The present leaders of the Scots had not forgotten the lessons taught them by the rashness of David ; and they wisely resolved to meet this invasion in the manner pointed out by the wisdom of Wallace, and the dying directions of Bruce. Orders were immediately issued for the in habitants to drive away their flocks and herds, and to convey all their valuables and property beyond the Firth of Forth, into the castles, caverns, and strong holds frequently used for such purposes ; to destroy and burn the hay and forage which was not readily transportable ; and to retire themselves, fully armed and equipped, and ready for immediate action, into the various well-known fastnesses, wooded glens, and mountain passes, from which they could watch the operations of the invading army.1 It was indispen sable, however, to procure time to carry these mea sures into execution ; and, for this purpose, the Earl of Douglas sought the army of Edward, which he found on its march from Roxburgh, and making a splendid appearance. It was led by the king in per son. Before him, floating amid other banners and pennons, was borne the royal standard of Scotland.2 The king's sons, John and Lionel, Dukes of Rich mond and Ulster, accompanied their father ; and, on the arrival of Douglas, when the army halted and * Ibid, p. 236. 1 Robert de Avesbury, p. 236."], [144, "108 1355. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. encamped, it covered an extent of twenty leagues.1 Douglas fortunately succeeded in procuring a ten days' truce ; during which time he pretended to com municate with the Scottish regent and nobles, and amused Edward with the hopes, that his title to the Scottish throne would be universally recognised. The messages, however, which passed between Dou glas and his friends related to designs the very op posite of submission ; and, when the truce was almost expired, the Scottish earl, who had completely gain ed his object, withdrew, and joined his countrymen. Enraged at being the dupe of so able a negotiator, Edward, in extreme fury, advanced through Ber wickshire into Lothian, and, with a cruel and short sighted policy, gave orders for the total devastation of the country.2 Every town, village, or hamlet, which lay within the reach of his soldiers, was given to the flames ; and the march of this Prince, who has commonly been reputed the very model of a gene rous and chivalrous conqueror, was to be traced by the thick clouds of smoke which hung over his army, and the black desert which he left behind him. In this indiscriminate vengeance, even the churches and religious houses were sacrilegiously plundered and cast down. A noble abbey-church at Haddington, whose quire, lighted by the long-shaped lantern win dows, of graceful and elegant proportion, went by the name of the Lamp of the Lothians, was entirely de- 1 Robert of Avesbury, p. 236.

It was now the month of January, and the winter storms increased the distress of the troops. Bread began to fail ; for fifteen days the soldiers had drunk nothing but water ; \" and, instead of being able to supply their wants by plunder, the English found nothing but empty stalls and deserted houses ; not a hoof was to be seen, so well had the orders of Douglas been obeyed. It may be imagined how dreadfully these privations were felt by an army which included three thousand picked cavalry, splen didly armed, both man and horse, besides ten thousand light-armed horse.3 The king, who saw famine and retreat approaching, now looked impatiently for his fleet. It was known that it had sailed from Ber- 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1048.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. wick, but no farther intelligence had arrived ; and after an anxious halt of ten days at Haddington, Ed ward pushed on to Edinburgh, with the hope of meeting his victualling ships at Leith. Instead, how ever, of the long expected supplies, certain news ar rived that the whole of the English fleet, in its at tempt to make the Firth, had been dispersed and de stroyed ; * so that it was judged absolutely necessary to retreat as speedily as possible, in order to save the ar my from absolute starvation. This order for retreat became, as was to be expected, the signal for disci pline to cease, and disorder to begin. Every wood or mountain-pass swarmed with Scottish soldiers, who harassed the rear with perpetual attacks ; and, in passing through the Forest of Melrose, the king himself was nearly taken or slain in an ambuscade which had been laid for him.2 He at length, how ever, reached Carlisle in safety, dismissed his barons, and returned to his capital ; from which he issued a pompous proclamation, declaring it to be his kingly will to preserve, untouched and inviolate, the ancient laws of Scotland ; a singular declaration with regard to a country in which he could scarcely call a single foot of ground his own.3 So cruel in its execution, and so inglorious in its result, was an expedition, in which Edward, at the head of an army infinitely greater than that which fought at Cressy, had, for the fifth time, invaded Scotland, declaring it to be i Fordun a Hearne, p. 1048.

DAVID II. 111 his determined resolution to reduce it for ever under his dominion. The expedition of Edward, from the wasting of the country by fire, was long afterwards remembered by the name of the \" Burnt Candlemas.\" So long as Scotland remained unconquered, it was evident that the English monarch must be content to have his ambitious efforts against France perpetually crippled and impeded. He felt, accordingly, the pa ramount importance of concluding the war in that country ; and seems to have imagined, that, by an overwhelming invasion, he could at once effect this object, and be enabled to concentrate his whole force against Philip. But the result convinced him that the Scots were farther than ever from being subdued, and that policy and intrigue were at the present con juncture more likely to be successful. He willingly, therefore, consented to a truce, and resumed the ne gotiations for the ransom of the king, and the conclu sion of a lasting peace between the two countries.1 The Earl of Douglas, to whose exertions the suc cess of the last campaign was mainly to be ascribed, seems to have been one of those restless and ardent spirits who languish unless in actual service ; and, accordingly, instead of employing the breathing time which was afforded him, in healing the wounds, and recruiting the exhausted strength of his country, he concluded a Border truce with the English warden,2 and, accompanied by a numerous body of knights and squires, passed over to France, and fought in the rae- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, p. 791. 8 Rymer, vol. v. p. 809."], [148, "1356. 112 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. morable battle of Poictiers. Douglas was received with high honour, and knighted on the field by the King of France. Amid the carnage of that dreadful day, he had the good fortune to escape death or cap tivity ; and, cooled in his passion for foreign distinc tion, to return to Scotland,1 where he resumed, along with the regent and the rest of the nobility, his more useful labours for his country. Hitherto the negotiations for the ransom and de livery of David had been entirely abortive. They were now renewed, and proved successful. After some preliminary conferences at London, between the council of the King of England and the Scottish Commissioners, the final settlement of the treaty was appointed to take place at Berwick-upon-Tweed.2 In the meantime, a solemn Parliament was held by the Steward, as governor of Scotland, at Edinburgh, on the 26th of September. Its constitution and pro ceedings, as shown in authentic instruments, pre served in the Foedera, are exceedingly important. It appears that, before meeting in Parliament, the pre lates of Scotland assembled their chapters, and ap- 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1052. 5 Rymer, vol. v. p. 831.

Each of the Estates then proceeded to elect certain mem bers of their own body as their commissioners, to ap pear at Berwick, and deliberate, with the delegates of the King of England, upon the ransom and libera tion of their sovereign. For this purpose, the cler gy chose the Bishops of St Andrews, Caithness, and Brechin.2 To these ecclesiastical delegates were add ed the Earls of March, Angus, and Sutherland, Sir Thomas de Moravia, Sir William Levingston, and Sir Robert Erskine, appointed by the regent and the ba rons ; and, lastly, the seventeen royal burghs chose eleven delegates of their own number, and intrusted them with the most ample powers.3 Such elections having taken place, the commissioners of both coun tries repaired to Berwick-upon-Tweed, on the day appointed, with great state and solemnity. Upon the part of England, there came the Primate of England, with the Bishops of Durham and Carlisle, and the 1 Rymer's Foedera, vol. vi. p. 39, 40. 2 Ibid. vol. vi. p. 43. 3 Ibid. vol. vi. pp. 44, 45.

The train of the Bishop of St Andrews alone consisted of thirty knights, with their squires ; the cortege of the other bishops and barons was scarcely less splendid ; L and the arrival of the captive monarch himself, escorted by the whole military ar ray of Northumberland, gave additional solemnity to the scene of negotiation.2 The result of these conferences at Berwick was, the restoration of David to his kingdom, after a cap tivity of eleven years. The ransom finally agreed on was a hundred thousand pounds, equivalent to the sum of twelve hundred thousand pounds of modern money, to be paid by annual instalments of four thou sand pounds ; and, in security of this payment, twen ty Scottish youths, heirs of the first families in the country, wrere delivered as hostages into the hands of the English monarch.3 It was stipulated besides, that, from the principal nobles of the kingdom, three should resort by turns to England, there to remain until the whole ransom was paid ; and, in the event of failure in the payment at any of the terms, the King of Scotland became bound to return to his cap tivity. It was also declared, that, until payment of 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. vi. pp. 32, 33. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 810. 3 Rymer, vol. vi. pp. 47, 48.

The ransom agreed on was oppressively high ; and it fell upon the country at a period when it was in a very low and exhausted condition. But the ransom was not the only drain on the re sources of the country. The numerous unsuccess ful attempts at negotiation which preceded this final settlement, had occasioned many journeys of the Scottish nobility to England, and such expeditions brought along with them a heavy expenditure. Be sides this, the ransom of the Scottish prisoners, ta ken in the battle of Durham ; their support, and that of the king their master, for many years in England ; 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 3d March, 1362-3. 37 Ed.

No such stipulation is to be found in the treaty, (Rymer, vol. vi. p, 46,) and Fordun himself makes no mention of it."], [152, "116 1357. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with the expense occasioned by the residence of three great nobles, and twenty young men of the first rank, for so long a time in another country, necessa rily occasioned an excessive drain of specie from Scotland. The possession, too, of the hostages by England tended greatly to cripple the power, and neutralise the independent efforts of her ancient ene my ; and the frequent intercourse between the nobles of the poorer and richer country, gave Edward op portunities of intrigue, which he by no means ne glected. Meanwhile, the representatives of the no bility, the bishops, and the burghs of Scotland, rati fied the treaty ; 1 and David, released from captivity, returned to Scotland, to receive the enthusiastic wel come of his people. But it was soon discovered, that the character and manners of the king had been deteriorated by his residence in England. His first public act was to summon a Parliament, to meet at Scone, regarding which there is a little anecdote preserved by a contemporary historian, which throws a strong light upon his harsh and fickle disposition. In the progress to the hall where the Estates were to meet, crowds of his people, who had not beheld their king for eleven years, pressed upon him, with rude, but flattering ardour. The monarch, whose march was thus affectionately interrupted, became in censed, instead of being gratified, and, wresting a mace from one of his attendants, threatened to beat to the ground any who dared to annoy him.

The enormous sum of the ransom, and the mode in which the annual instalment should be collected, ap pears to have been the first subject which occupied the attention of the great council. The provisions upon this are important, as illustrating the state of commerce in the country. It was resolved, that the whole wool and wool-fels of the kingdom should be given to the king, at the rate of four merks for the sack of wool, and the same sum for every parcel of two hundred fleeces ; and, it is probable, that the king afterwards exported these sacks and fleeces, at a high profit, to foreign parts, or disposed of them to fo reign merchants who resorted to Scotland.2 In the next place, a minute and accurate account of the rents and produce of the whole lands of the realm, and a list of the names of the proprietors, was ap pointed to be taken by certain sworn commissioners 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 283. 2 Robertson's Parliament. Record, pp. 96, 97. Knighton, p. 2570."], [154, "118 1357. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. appointed for the purpose. From this account were specially excepted all white sheep, domestic horses, oxen, and household furniture ; but, so minute was the scrutiny, that the names of all mechanics, trades men, and artificers, were directed to be taken, with the declared purpose of ascertaining what tax would be proper to be paid on the real value of their pro perty, and what sum each person, of his own free will, would be ready to contribute towards the ran som of the king. Proclamation was directed to be made throughout the kingdom, that, during the term within which such an account was to be taken, no one should sell or export any sheep or lambs. Officers were to be stationed on the marches to prevent such an occurrence, every hoof or fleece which wras car ried off was to be seized and forfeited to the king ; while the sheriffs of the respective counties, and the barons and gentry, were directed to use their ut most endeavour, that none should dare to refuse such taxation, or fraudulently attempt to escape, by trans ferring themselves from one part of the country to another. If any of the sheriffs, tax-gatherers, or their officers, were found guilty of any fraud, or un faithful conduct ; or, if any individuals were disco vered concealing their property ; all such delinquents were ordered to stand their trial at the next Justice Ayre ; which, it was appointed, should be held by the king in person, that the royal presence might ensure a more solemn distribution of justice, and strike terror into offenders. A provision was next made, that in each county there should be good and"], [155, "1357- DAVID II. 119 sufficient sheriffs, coroners, bailies, and inferior offi cers ; it was Ordered, that all lands, rents, or cus toms, belonging originally to the king, should be re sumed, to whatever persons they might have been granted, in order that the whole royal lands should continue untouched ; and that the kingdom, already burdened by the king's ransom, might be freed from any additional tax for the maintenance of the throne. The king was required to renew that part of his co ronation oath, by which he had solemnly promised, that he should not alienate the crowm-lands, or dis j>ose, without mature advice, of any rents, wards, or escheats appertaining to the crown, and there was a prohibition against exporting the sterling money out of the realm, by any person whatever, unless upon the payment to the crown of half a merk for each pound.1 During the captivity of the sovereign, it appears that they who, at various times, were at the head of affairs, had either appropriated to themselves, or made donations to their vassals and dependents, of various portions of the crown-lands ; and it was, therefore, enacted, that all those who had thus rashly and pre sumptuously entered into possession of any lands or wardships belonging to the crown, should, under pain of imprisonment, be compelled to restore them into the hands of the king. The next article in the resolu tions of this Parliament is extremely obscure. It was resolved, \" that all the lands, possessions, and goods 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Record, pp. 96, 97."], [156, "120 1357. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of the homicides, after the battle of Durham, who have not yet bound themselves to obey the law of the land, should be seized in the hands of the king, until they come under sufficient security to obey the law ; and that all pardons or remissions granted to persons of this description, by the governors of the kingdom, during the absence of the king, should not be ratified, unless at the pleasure of our lord the king.\" And it was also provided that, if any person, after the captivity of the sovereign, had resigned into the hands of the regent any tenement, which he held of the crown in capite, which property had been be stowed upon another, who had alienated it in whole, or in part, without the royal permission, all such tenements should again be seized in the hands of the king. The names of the nobles and barons who sat in this Parliament being lost, we can only conjecture, that some individuals had absented themselves, from the idea, that the riots and disturbances which they had excited during the captivity of the king, would be visited with punishment. It is stated in the Scala Chronicle, that soon after the conflict at Dur ham, the private feuds amongst the nobility were carried to a grievous height, and that the kingdom was torn by homicides, rapine, and private war, for which Fordun does not hesitate indirectly to crimi nate the Steward.1 It is certain, at least, from the 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1039.

For the present, however, there was the appearance of great tranquillity. The treaty which had settled the ransom received the approbation of the parlia- ment, and Edward not only gave orders for its strict fulfilment, but sought by every method to ingratiate himself with the prelates and the nobility of Scot- land. His object in all this became soon apparent. Aware, from repeated experience, of the difficulty of reducing this country by open force, a deeper and more dangerous policy was adopted. He had already gained an extraordinary influence over the weak cha- racter of the king, and had secretly prevailed upon him to acknowledge the feudal superiority of Eng- land. David being without children, there existed a jealousy between him and the Steward, who had been nominated next heir to the crown ; and we may date from this period, the rise of a dark faction, to which the Scottish king meanly lent himself as a party, and the daring object of which was to intrude a son of Edward the Third into the Scottish throne. For some time, however, this conspiracy against the in- dependence of the nation was carefully concealed, so that it is difficult to discover the secret details or the principal agents ; but from the frequent journeys of some of the Scottish prelates and barons to the court of"], [158, "122 1357. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. England, from the secret and mysterious instructions under which they acted, and the readiness with which they were welcomed,1 there arises a strong presump tion that this monarch had gained them over to his in terest. The Earl of Angus, one of David's hostages, had private meetings with the King of England, and was dispatched to Scotland that he might confer with his own sovereign upon matters which shun the light, and do not appear as usual in the instruments and passports.2 Within a short period the Scottish queen, a sister of Edward, made two visits to London, for the purpose of treating with her brother on certain secret matters which are not specified in her safe con duct. The King of Scotland next sought the Eng lish court in his own person, and after his return, the Bishop of St Andrews, the Earl of March, along with the Earl of Douglas, Sir Robert Erskine, and Sir William Livingstone, were repeatedly employed in these mysterious missions, which at this period took place between the two monarchs.3 These ba rons generally travelled with a numerous suite of knights or squires ;4 and while their masters were engaged in negotiation, the young knights enjoyed their residence at a court then the most chivalrous in 1 Rotul.

Large sums of money were required for such embassies, and the probability is, that they were chiefly defrayed by the English monarch, who looked for a return in the feelings of gratitude and obligation, which he thus hoped to create in the breasts of the Scottish nobility. Nor were other methods of conciliation neglected by this politic prince. He encouraged the merchants of Scotland to trade with England by grants of protec tion and immunity, which form a striking contrast to the spirit of jealousy and exclusion with which they had lately been treated.1 From the moment of David's return, a complete change took place in the commercial policy of Eng land, and the Scottish merchants were welcomed with a liberality, which, could we forget its object, was as generous as it was beneficial to both countries. At the same time, the youth of Scotland were induced to frequent the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, by the ready kindness with which the king gave them letters of protection ; 2 and the religious, who wished to make pilgrimages to the most celebrated shrines in England, found none of those impediments to their pious expeditions which had lately existed. At this moment, when designs existed against the indepen dence of Scotland, so dangerous in their nature, and so 1 Foedera, new ed. vol. ii. part i. p. 188. Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. 32 Ed.

Sir Tho mas Bisset, and Sir Walter Moigne, with Norman and Walter Leslie, previous to David's return, had left the country on an expedition to Prussia,1 in all pro bability to join the Teutonic knights, who w7ere en gaged in a species of crusade against the infidel Prus sians.2 Not long after, Sir William Keith, Marshal of Scotland, Sir William Sinclair Lord of Roslin, Sir Alexander de Lindesay, Sir Robert Gifford, and Sir Alexander Montgomery, each with a noble train of sixty horse, and a strong body of foot soldiers, pass ed through England to the continent, eager for dis tinction in foreign wars, with which they had no concern, and foolishly deserting their country when it most required their services.3 Yet this conduct was more pardonable than that of the Earl of Mar, who entered into the service of England, and with a retinue of twenty four knights and their squires pass ed over to France in company with the English mo narch and his army.4 The example was infectious ; and the love of enterprise, the renown of fighting un der so illustrious a leader, and the hopes of plunder, induced other Scottish soldiers to imitate his example.

Many of the barons were secretly in his interest ; some had actually embraced his service ; the king himself was wholly at his devotion ; the constant intercourse which he had encouraged, had softened, as he hoped, and diluted, the bitterness of national animosity ; and the possession of his twenty hostages had tied up the hands of the principal barons of the land, who, in other circumstances, would have been at liberty to have acted strenuously against him. No thing now remained but to develope the great plan which all this artful preparation was intended to fos ter and facilitate ; but for this, matters were not yet considered far enough advanced. Meanwhile, David anxiously adopted every method to collect the sums necessary for his ransom ; nor shall we wonder at his activity, when we remember that his liberty or his return to the Tower depended on his success. He had already paid the first ten thou sand merks ;J and the Pope, at his earnest request, consented that for the term of three years he should levy a tenth of all the ecclesiastical benefices in Scot land, under the express condition that the Scottish clergy were, after this, to be exempted from all fur ther contribution. Yet this stipulated immunity was soon forgotten or disregarded by the king ; and in addition to the tenth, the lands and temporalities of all ecclesiastics in Scotland, whether they held of the king or of subjects superior, were compelled to con- 1 Rotuli Scot. 32 Ed.

In Scotland, the difficulty of rais ing money, owing to the exhausted and disorganized state of the kingdom, was excessive ; and the king in despair, and compelled by the influence of the party of the Stewrard, which supported the independence of the country, forgot for a moment the intimate rela tions which now bound him to Edward, and opened a negotiation with the regent of France, in which he agreed to renew the war with England, provided that prince and his kingdom would assist him with the money which he now imperiously required.2 To these demands the French plenipotentiaries replied,3 that in the present conjunction of affairs, when France was exhausted with war, and her king and many of her highest nobility in captivity, it was impossible for her to assist her ancient ally so speedily or so effectually as she desired. They agreed, however, to contribute the sum of fifty thousand merks4 towards defraying the ransom, under the condition that the Scots should 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1054. 2 Rymer, vol. vi. p. 178. 3 Traittez Entre les Roys de France et les Roys D'Escosse, MS. in Ad.

These stipula tions upon the part of the French were never fulfil led. An army of a hundred thousand men, led by Edward in person, passed over to Calais a few months after the negotiation, 1 and France saw in the ranks of her invaders many of the Scottish barons, who had become the servile tools of England. Amongst those whom the English king had seduced, was Thomas Earl of Angus, one of the hostages for David, a daring adventurer, who had commissioned from the Flem ings four ships of war, with which he promised to meet Edward at Calais. But on procuring his liber ty, Angus forgot his engagement, and remaining in Scotland, acted a principal part in the commotions which then distracted the country.2 Sir Thomas Bis set, Sir William of Tours, and Sir John Borondon, and probably many other Scottish knights, accompa nied Edward.3 In France, howTever, they had little opportunity of signalizing themselves ; and after an inglorious campaign, wherein the English monarch was obliged successively to raise the sieges of Rheims and Paris, hostilities were concluded by the celebra ted treaty of Bretigny, in which the two belligerent powers consented to a mutual sacrifice of allies.

On the other hand, the confederacy, which had been gradually gain ing ground in favour of England, and now included amongst its supporters the Scottish king himself and many of his nobles, could not fail to be gratified by a result which rendered a complete reconciliation with Edward more likely to occur, and thus paved the way for the nearer developement of their secret designs, by which the Steward was ultimately to be ejected from the throne. Whilst such was the course of events in France, Scotland at home presented a scene of complicated distress and suffering. A dreadful inundation laid the whole of the rich country of Lothian under wa ter. The clouds poured down torrents such as had never before been seen by the oldest inhabitants ; and the rivers, breaking over their banks with irresistible violence, destroyed ramparts and bridges, tore up the strongest oaks and forest trees by the roots, and car ried houses and barns, stacks and implements of hus- ' Rymer F\u0153dera, vol. vi. p. 192.

His favourite mistress, Catherine Mortimer, whom he had loved during his captivity, had afterwards accompanied him into Scot land, and from some causes not now discoverable, became an object of jealousy and hatred to the Earl of Angus and others of the Scottish nobles. At their instigation, two villains, named Hulle and Dewar, un dertook to murder her, and having sought her resi dence under a pretence that they came from the king with instructions to bring her to court, prevailed up on the unsuspecting victim to intrust herself to then guidance. They travelled on horseback, and on the desolate moor between Melrose and Soutra, where her cries could bring none to her assistance, Hulle stabbed her with his dagger and dispatched her in an instant.2 David instantly imprisoned the Earl of Angus in Dumbarton Castle, where he fell a victim to the plague, and commanded his unfortunate fa vourite to be buried with all honour in the abbey of Newbattle. Towards the conclusion of the year which was marked by this base murder, a secret negotiation, re garding the subject of which the public records give us no certain information, took place between Edward 1 Fordun a Goodal, p. 365. - Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 578 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 365."], [167, "1361.

The Bishops of St Andrews and Brechin, with the Arch-deacon of Lothian, the Earls of March and Douglas, Sir Robert Erskine, and Sir John Preston, repaired, with a splendid and nu merous retinue, to the English court, but the object of their mission is studiously concealed. It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to understand or to unravel the complicated intrigues and the various factions, which divided the country at this period. The king himself was wholly in the interest and under the government of Edward. The Steward, on the other hand, to whom the people affectionately looked as his succes sor, and whose title to the throne had been recogni sed by a solemn act of the three Estates of the King dom, was at the head of the party which opposed the designs of England, and strenuously defended the independence of the country. Many of the nobles, seduced by the example of their sovereign, and by the wealth of England, deserted to Edward. Many others, indignant at such treachery, leagued them selves in the strictest ties with the Steward, and be tween these two parties there existed, we may believe, the most deadly animosity. But we may, I think, trace in the records of the times \u2014 for our ancient his torians give us no light on the subject \u2014 another and more moderate party, to whom Edward and David did not discover their ultimate intentions for the to tal destruction of the independence of Scotland as a separate kingdom, but who hailed with joy, and en couraged with patriotic eagerness, those pacific mea sures which were employed to pave the way for their"], [168, "1362. 132 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. darker designs. Nor is it difficult to understand the feelings which gave rise to such a party. A war of almost unexampled length and animosity had weak ened and desolated the country. Every branch of national prosperity had been withered or destroyed by its endurance ; and it is easy to conceive how wel come must have been the breathing time of peace, and how grateful those measures of free trade and unfet tered intercourse between the two countries, which Edward adopted, from the moment of David's libera tion till the period of his death.1 It is quite possible to believe that such men as the Earl of Douglas and Sir Robert Erskine, the Bishops of St Andrews and Brechin, with other prelates and nobles, who were engaged in perpetual secret negotiations with Edward, should have been amused with propositions for a complete union and a perpetual peace between the two countries ; while\" David himself and those traitors who were admitted into the deeper parts of the plot assisted at their negotiations, sheltered them selves under their upright character, and thus dis armed suspicion. Meanwhile, under this change of measures, Scot land gradually improved, and the people, unconscious of the hidden designs which threatened to bring her down to the level of a province of England, enjoyed the benefits and blessings of peace. The country pre sented a stirring and busy scene. Merchants from Perth, Aberdeen, Kirkaldy, Edinburgh, and the va- 1 Rotuli Scot. vol. i. p. 859, 862."], [169, "1362.

We find these passports grant ed to bodies of fifty and sixty at a time ; each of the merchants being men of such wealth and substance, as to be accompanied by a suite of four, five, or six horsemen. In the year 1363 passports are, of the same date, granted to forty-nine Scottish merchants, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, pp. 760, 881, 891, 911, 925.

On one memorable occasion, in the space of a single month, a party of sixty-five mer chants obtain safe-conducts to travel through Eng land, for the purposes of trade ; and their warlike suite amounts to no less than two hundred and thirty horsemen.1 Besides this, the Scottish youth, and many scho lars of more advanced years, crowded to the colleges of England ; 2 numerous parties of pilgrims travelled to the various shrines of saints and martyrs, and were liberally welcomed and protected ;3 whilst, in those Scottish districts which were still in the hands of the English, Edward, by preserving to the inha bitants their ancient customs and privileges, endea voured to overcome the national antipathy, and con ciliate the affections of the people. Commissions were granted to his various officers in Scotland, em powering them to receive the homage and adherence of the Scots, who had hitherto refused to acknow ledge his authority ; passports, and all other means of indulgence and protection, were withdrawn from such as resisted, or became objects of suspicion ; and 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 886. 2 Ibid. pp. 886, 891. 3 Ibid. pp. 878, 879, 880.

Although the ramifications of the conspiracy, by which Edward and David attempted to destroy the independence of Scotland, are exceedingly obscure, enough, I think, has been pointed out to prove that it had been going on for many years. We have seen that the English king purchased from Baliol the whole kingdom ; that David had completely throwrn himself into the arms of England, and even actual ly acknowledged the superiority of the one crown over the other ; and now that it was imagined all obstacles were removed, we are to witness the open developement, and the utter discomfiture, of this ex traordinary plot. A parliament was summoned at Scone in the month of March 1363 ;J and the king, after alluding to the late negotiation for a final peace, which had taken place between the commissioners of both countries, proceeded to explain, to the three Es tates, the conditions upon which EdwTard had agreed to concede this inestimable blessing to the country. He proposed, in the event of his death, that the states of the realm should choose one of the sons of the King of England to fill the Scottish throne ; and he recom mended, in the strongest manner, that such choice 1 4th March, 1363-4.

In such circumstances, it required neither time nor deliberation to give their answer. It was brief, and perfectly unanimous. \" We never,\" said they, \" will allow an Englishman to rule over us ; the proposition of the king is fool ish and improvident, for he ought to have recollected that there exist heirs to the throne, whose age and virtues render them worthy of that high station; and to whom the three Estates are bound to adhere, by the deeds of settlement, which have been ratified by their own solemn oath. \u2014 Yet,\" they added, \" they ear nestly desired peace ; and, provided the royal state, liberty, and separate independence of the kingdom were not infringed upon, would willingly make every sacrifice to attain it.\"1 With this resolute answer the king was deeply mo ved.

It was determined to open an immediate negotiation with England, preparatory to a final treaty of peace ; and for this purpose, Sir Robert Erskine, along with Walter Wardlaw the Archdeacon of Lothian, and Gilbert Armstrong, were appointed commissioners by the parliament. With regard to the ransom, the nobles declared, that they were ready to suffer every privation, and cheer fully to strain every nerve, for the payment of the whole sum ; and that they would use their utmost exertion to prevent the truce between the two coun tries from being broken, as well as to answer for the fines and penalties which were already due for its in fringement, by that party which was adverse to Eng land.2 These expressions alluded, no doubt, to the Steward and his friends, who, for some time before 1 Winton, B. 8. c. 45, p. 294. 2 In the record of this important parliament, which is unfortu nately in an extremely mutilated state, there is some obscurity as to the meaning of the words \" Si que per partem adversam pro commissis hactenus possent infligi vel obici.\" I understand the \" pars adversa\" to be the party of the Steward, which was decided ly hostile to England, and eager to break the truce.

The object of this daring plan, which, there is reason to believe, had been maturing during the whole course of David's captivity, was now avowed in open parliament ; and if carried into execution, it would have excluded for ever from the throne of Scotland, the Steward, and all descendants of Robert the Bruce. We are not, therefore, to wonder that the bare proposal of such a scheme alarmed and agitated the whole kingdom. It was instantly, indeed, re pelled and put down by the strong hand of parlia ment, and apparently given up by the king ; but all confidence between David and his nobles was destroy ed from this moment, and the effects of this mutual suspicion became soon apparent. The Steward, who had good reason to suspect the sincerity of the king, assembled his friends, to deli berate upon the course of proceedings which it was deemed necessary to adopt ; and a very formidable league or conspiracy was soon formed, which included amongst its supporters a great majority of the nobi lity. According to a common practice in that age, the lords and barons who stood forward against the king, entered into bonds or agreements of mutual defence and support, which were solemnly ratified by their oath and seal. The Steward himself, with the Earl of March, the Earl of Douglas, the Steward's two 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1057."], [177, "136,1 DAVID II. 141 sons, John Steward of Kyle and Robert Steward of Menteith, and others of the most powerful nobility in the country, openly proclaimed, that they would either compel the king to renounce for ever his de signs, and adhere to the succession, or would at once banish him from the throne.1 To show that these were not empty menaces, they instantly assembled their retainers, and in great force traversed the country. The nobles who supported David were cast into prison, their lands ravaged, their wealth, or ra ther the wealth of their unfortunate vassals and la bourers, seized as legitimate spoil ; and the toAvns and trading burghs, where those industrious mercan tile classes resided, who had no wish to engage in political revolution, were cruelly invaded and plun dered. The violence of these proceedings gave to the cause of the king a temporary colour of justice, and of this his personal courage, the only quality which he inherited from his great father, enabled him to take advantage. He instantly issued a proclamation, \u2014 in which he commanded the rebels to lay down their arms, and return to their allegiance, as peace able and faithful subjects ; and summoned his barons to arm themselves and his vassals in defence of the insulted majesty of the throne.2 To the body of the disinherited barons in England, whose strength had, not long before, achieved so rapid a revolution, in 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1057. - Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 367."], [178, "1363. 142 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. placing Baliol on the throne, David confidently looked for assistance. This party included the Earl of Athole, the Lords Percy, Beaumont, Talbot and Ferrers, with Godfrey de Ros, and a few other powerful nobles. From them, and from Edward himself, there is reason to believe that the king received prompt support both in men and money ; for it is certain that he was able to collect a numerous army, and to distribute amongst the soldiers infinitely larger sums for their pay and equipment than the exhausted state of the country and of his own coffers could have afforded.1 The strong castles of Rokesburgh, Jedburgh, and Lochmaben, with the Border districts around them, comprehending Annandale, part of Teviotdale, and the Merse,2 were in the hands of the English, who compelled their warlike population to serve against the Steward ; so that David was enabled to advance instantly against his enemies, with a force which it would have been folly in them to attempt to resist. It was fortunate that the two parties thus ranged in deadly opposition against each other, were yet mutually afraid of push ing matters into the extremities of a war. The king knew that he was generally unpopular, and that his attempt to change the succession was regarded with bitter hostility, not only by the nobles, but by the whole body of the nation, and he naturally dreaded to call these feelings into more prominent action.3 On 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1058.

These mutual feelings led to a treaty which saved the coun try from a civil war. On the approach of the royal army, the Steward, and the barons who supported him, agreed to lay down their arms and submit to the clemency of the king. The mutual bonds and en gagements by which their party was cemented, were solemnly disclaimed and cancelled in an assembly of the whole nobility of Scotland, which was convoked on the 14th of May, at Inchmurdach, a palace of the Bishop of St Andrews,1 where the Steward again renewed his oath to David. He swore upon the holy gospels that he would henceforth continue faithful to the king as his sovereign and liege lord ; that to the utmost of his power he would defend him from his enemies, and support his servants and ministers against every opposition ; and this he promised, un der the penalty of losing all title to the throne of Scotland, of forfeiting his lands and possessions for ever, and of being accounted a perjured and disho noured knight.1 In return for this prompt submission, the Steward's title in the succession was distinctly recognised, and the earldom of Carrick conferred upon his eldest son, afterwards Robert the Third.2 The Earls of 1 Macpherson's Geographical Illustrations of Scottish History. - Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 369."], [180, "1364. 144 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND.

But this was only a temporary ebullition of activity, and as if worn out by the exertion, the king relapsed into his usual indolence and love of plea sure. It was at this critical time he happened to meet with Margaret Logie, \u2014 a woman of inferior birth, but extraordinary beauty. She was the daughter of one of the lower order of barons, and related, in all probability, to that John de Logy, who had been exe cuted for treason during the latter part of the reign of Robert Bruce. Of this lady, David, ever the slave of his passions, became deeply enamoured ; and, heed less of the consequences, determined to possess him self of the object of his affection. Overlooking, ac cordingly, in the ardour of his pursuit, all difference of rank, and despising the resentment of his proud nobility, the king married this fair unknown, and rai sed her to the throne, which had been filled by the sister of Edward the Third.

Disgust and jea lousy soon arose between the queen and the nobility ; and such was the influence which she at first possessed over the fickle and impetuous monarch, that he cast the Steward, with his son, Alexander Lord of Bade noch, into prison ; and soon after, weary of his own kingdom, and aware of his unpopularity, obtained a safe-conduct to travel into England, on a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Virgin at Walsingham.1 His fair queen, at the same time on the like errand, accompa nied by a gallant train of thirty knights, sought the shrine of St Thomas of Canterbury ; and Scotland, deserted by her sovereign, and with the nearest heir to the crown in a dungeon, regarded with deep ap prehension a state of things, which, to the most super ficial eye, was full of danger. It was not to be expected that a prince, of the ta lents and ambition of Edward the Third, should fail to perceive, and take advantage of, these complicated difficulties. An immense part of the ransom due by the King of Scotland was still unpaid ; and, as the regular terms of settlement had long been neglected, the penalties incurred by such a failure increased the principal sum to an overwhelming amount. The king's increasing unpopularity in Scotland rendered it impossible for him to collect the money which was 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 380.

It was only by the kindness and suffer ance of Edward that he had not been repeatedly re manded to his prison in the Tower ; and, in a few years, if this state of things continued, he felt that he must lay down his royal pomp, and, deserted by a people who bore him neither love nor respect, re turn to the condition of a captive.1 These reflections embittered his repose ; he determined to consent to every sacrifice, to get rid of a ransom which made him a slave to Edward, and an abject suitor to his subjects ; and, under the influence of such feelings, again engaged in a secret treaty with England, against the independence of his own country.2 It will be recollected, that the states of Scotland had already dispatched the Bishops of St Andrews and Brechin, along with Sir Robert Erskine, the Chamberlain of Scotland, to negotiate a peace be tween the two countries ; 3 and to the result of this public embassy we shall soon advert. In the mean time, whilst these deliberations proceeded, a secret conference, of a very extraordinary nature, was held between the privy councillors of David and Edward, and in presence of both monarchs, at Westminster, on the 26th of November, 1363.4 The real object of this meeting was an attempt, upon the part of Ed ward, to renew his designs for the entire subjection of Scotland. Yet this was done with a caution strong ly indicating his sense of the flame which the bare 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. vi. p. 48. - Ibid. p. 426. 3 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 100.

DAVID II. 147 suspicion of such a renewal would kindle in that country. It is anxiously premised, in the first pas sage of the record of this secret conference, that every thing that was done was solely to be regarded in the light of an experiment, and that the various stipula tions and conditions which it contains, are not to be considered as finally agreed to, either by one par ty or the other, but simply as attempts to bring about, under the blessing of God, a lasting peace be tween the two nations. The King of Scotland, who, along with Edward, was personally present whilst the various articles were made the subject of consult ation, consented that, in the event of his death with out heirs-male of his body, the King of England, and his heirs, should succeed to the throne of Scotland ; upon which event, the town and castle of Berwick, with the castles of Roxburgh, Jedburgh, and Loch maben, and the whole lands occupied by Robert the First at the time of his death, and now in the hands of the King of England, were to be delivered up to Scotland ; whilst the whole arrears of the ransom, as well as all penalties and obligations incurred by its non-payment, were to be cancelled for ever. These were the two principal articles in the con ference ; but a variety of inferior stipulations were added, the object of which was evidently to endea vour to reconcile the people of Scotland to a sacrifice of the independent throne of their country, by the solemn manner in which Edward agreed to preserve unimpaired its ancient constitution, and the laws and usages of the kingdom. It was agreed that the name and title of the kingdom of Scotland should be pre-"], [184, "148 1364.

The kings of England were henceforth to be crowned kings of Scotland at Scone, upon the regal and fatal stone-seat, which was to be imme- diately conveyed thither from England ; and the ce- remony was to be performed by those Scottish pre- lates who were deputed by the church of Roine to that high office. All parliaments regarding Scottish affairs were to be held within that kingdom ; and a solemn oath was to be taken by the English monarch that, as king of Scotland, he would preserve inviolate the rights and immunities of the holy Scottish church, and consent that she should be subject neither to bi- shop nor archbishop, but solely to the Pope. In ad- dition to all this, Edward engaged faithfully that the subjects of Scotland should never be called upon to answer to any suit, except within the courts of their own kingdom, and according to their own laws. He promised that no ecclesiastical benefices or dignities, and no civil or military office, such as that of chan- cellor, chamberlain, justice, sheriff, provost, bailie, governor of town or castle, or other officer, should be conferred on any, except the true subjects of the king- dom of Scotland ; and that, in affairs touching the weal of that realm, he would select his councillors from the peers and lords of Scotland alone. He en gaged, also, to maintain the prelates, earls, barons, and free tenants of that country, in their franchises"], [185, "1364. DAVID II. 149 and seignories, in their estates, rents, possessions, and offices, according to the terms of their charter ; and pledged his royal word to make no revocation of any of the grants made or confirmed by Robert Bruce, or his son, the present king.1 With regard to an important branch in the na tional prosperity, \u2014 the commerce of Scotland, it was declared, that the merchants of that realm should fully and freely enjoy their own privileges, without being compelled to repair, for the sale of their com modities, to Calais, or any other staple, except at their own option ; and that they should pay half a merk to the great custom upon each sack of wool which they exported. The duty on the exportation of English wool was higher ; and this article form ed one of those many devices by which Edward, in his present projects, artfully endeavoured to se cure the good-will of the rich burghers of Scotland, \u2014 a class of men now rising rapidly into influence and consideration. Nor were other baits for popula rity neglected by those who framed this insidious treaty. To the powerful Earl of Douglas it was held out, that he should be restored to the estates in Eng land which had been possessed by his father and his uncle ; \u2014 to the disinherited lords, the Earl of Athole, the Barons Percy, Beaumont, and Ferrers, with the heirs of Talbot, and all who claimed lands in Scotland, either by the gift of David when a prisoner, or on any other ground, there was promised a full restoration to their estates, without further trouble or challenge. 1 Rymer's Foedera, vol. vi. p. 427."], [186, "1364. 150 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. The clergy were attempted to be propitiated by an arti cle, which promised to every religious house or abbey, the restoration of the rich lands which had been torn from them during the excesses and calamities of war; and to the numerous and powerful body of vassals, or military tenants, who formed the strength of the nation, it was distinctly announced that, under the change which was to give them a new king, they were yet only to be bound by the ancient and acknowledged laws of military service, which compelled them to serve, under the banner of their lord, for forty days at their own expense ; but that afterwards, any far ther continuance with the host should entitle them to receive pay according to their state and quality. A general indemnity was offered to all Scottish subjects, in the declaration that no challenge or action what ever should be used against those who had departed from the oaths of homage which they had formerly sworn to England ; and, as to any additional condi tions or articles which the three Estates of Scotland might judge it right to demand, for the profit or good of their kingdom, the King of England declared, that these points should be duly weighed by his council, and determined according to their advice. This extraordinary public document concludes by a promise upon the part of David, that he would im mediately sound the inclinations of his people upon the subjects of the conference, and inform the King of England and his privy council of their feelings re garding the propositions it contained, fifteen days after Easter.1 1 F\u0153dera, vol. vi. p. 427."], [187, "1364. DAVID II. 151 There remains no record by which we can dis cover whether this treaty was ever made the subject of deliberation in the Scottish Parliament, or even in the privy council ; but, fortunately for the peace of the country, it was unknown to the people for many hundred years after the conference. Mean while David and his queen remained at the court of Edward, rendered at this time especially brilliant, by the presence of the Kings of France, Cyprus, and Denmark.1 Amid the splendid entertainments, in which this weak prince endeavoured to forget his kingdom, and to silence and drown reflection, one is worthy of notice. Sir Henry Picard, a wine-merchant, gave a feast, in his own mansion, to his royal master, Edward the Third. He invited, at the same time, the Kings of France, Scotland, Cyprus, and Den mark, with the personal suites of these monarchs, the sons of Edward, and the principal barons of Eng land, who were all welcomed with princely magnifi cence. Whilst these guests were feasting in the hall, his wife, the Lady Margaret, received, in her own apartments, the princesses and ladies of the court. A simple citizen of London, entertaining five kings in his own house, affords a remarkable picture of the wealth of the capital. Amid such -secret treachery and public rejoicings, the Scottish commissioners continued their negotia tions for peace ; and, after long debate and delay, re- 1 Barnes's Edward III. p. 633.

David also repaired to his king dom, and a parliament was summoned to meet at Perth, for the purpose of reporting to the three Es tates the result of the deliberations on the projected treaty between the two countries.1 This great council met accordingly on the 13th of January, 1364, and no thing could be more wise and independent than their conduct. The embarrassment of the nation, resulting from the immense expenditure of public money, and the increasing anxiety caused by the great portion of the king's ransom, which was yet unpaid, are appa rent in their deliberations ; and they wrere willing to make every sacrifice in order to extricate the country from the difficulties which surrounded it, to be freed from the payment of the ransom, and to obtain an honourable and lasting peace. For the accomplish ment of this end, they declare themselves ready to restore the disinherited lords, meaning by this the Earl of Athole, the Lords Percy, Beaumont, Talbot, Ferrers, Godfrey de Ros, and a few others of inferior note, to the estates which they claimed in Scotland ;' and to settle upon the youngest son of the King of England, the lands in Galloway which were the in heritance of Edward Baliol, and the Isle of Man. The annual income of this island is rated at a thou sand merks ; and it is stipulated, that if the Earl of Salisbury should claim the property of the island, an annuity of one thousand merks sterling should be 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 101. 2 Robertson's Par!.

In the event of such conditions being ac cepted by England as an equivalent for the ransom, they declare themselves ready to show their sincerity as allies by an invasion of Ireland, conducted by the king in person, and directed against that part of the coast where the landing is likely to be most successful. The anxiety of the parliament for peace is strongly marked in the next article in their deliberations. If, say they, these conditions, which we are ready to make the basis of our negotiation, are not accepted by England, still, rather than renounce all hopes of a just and lasting peace, we have unanimously agreed that the ransom shall be paid, provided that moderate intervals between each term of payment are allowed ; and in the understanding that a perpetual union and alliance takes place between the two nations, if not on terms of a perfect equality of power, at least on such conditions as shall in no degree compromise the freedom and independence of Scotland. In these con ditions the Estates declare themselves willing to in clude the articles regarding the disinherited lords, the provision to the son of the King of England, and the invasion of Ireland, provided the talents and in dustry of those to whom the negotiation has been intrusted are unsuccessful in obtaining a mitigation of the same. A proportional deduction from the large 1 Robertson's Park Ree. p. 101."], [190, "1364. 154 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. sum of the ransom was of course to be made, if such conditions are accepted by England. It became, in the next place, a subject of grave consideration with the parliament, what conduct ought to be pursued, if, by such sacrifices, they were yet un able to procure the blessing of peace ; and in their de liberations upon this subject, we are introduced to a view of the great efforts which the country was ready to make, and of the mode in which the three Estates proposed to raise money for the payment of the ran som, which is important and instructive. Of the original sum which had been stipulated, namely, one hundred thousand merks sterling, twenty thousand merks had been already paid ; although, ow ing to the instalments not having been regularly trans mitted at the appointed periods, there had been an accumulation of a considerable sum in the form of pe nalty for non-payment. It was accordingly proposed by the parliament, that England should agree to a truce for twenty-four years, upon which they were ready to pay down annually, during the continuance of that period, five thousand merks sterling, till the sum of a hundred and twenty thousand merks was completed, being the whole accumulated ransom and penalty. Should the English council refuse a ces sation on such terms, two other schemes are sug gested. The first is the payment of a hundred thou sand pounds, at the rate of five thousand merks year ly, exclusive of the twenty thousand merks already received by England ; and if this should fail to be accepted, they declare themselves willing, rather than"], [191, "1364. DAVID II. 155 renounce the hopes of a truce, to pay down in ten years, at the rate of ten thousand merks annually, the full sum of a hundred thousand merks, as stipulated in the first treaty regarding the ransom of the king. The manner in which this enormous sum was to be raised became next the subject of consideration. It was determined that an annual tax, or custom, of eight thousand merks was to be levied upon the whole wool of the kingdom, and that certain tried and faith ful burgesses should be appointed to receive it in Flanders in English money ; but the precaution was added, that it would be necessary to have some ex perienced person to attend in the weighing-house up on the part of the king, to superintend the annual payments, and watch over the interests of his master. In this manner, eight thousand merks were to be paid annually, according to the conditions of the first treaty. In addition to this, it was enacted in the same par liament, that a general annual tax should be levied throughout the kingdom of six pennies in the pound upon every person, without exception. Out of this general sum, two thousand merks were to be yearly appropriated to make up the ten thousand merks of the redemption money, and the residue was to remain in the hands of the chamberlain for the necessary ex penses of the king. The lords and barons assembled in parliament so lemnly engaged to ratify and approve of any treaty of peace or truce, which the plenipotentiaries who mana ged the negotiation might conclude with the King of"], [192, "156 1364. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. England and his council, and to adhere to, and carry into effect, the above-mentioned ordinance for the pay ment of the ransom strictly and faithfully. They agreed, also, that they would not, secretly or openly, for themselves or for their dependents, demand the re storation of any lands, which, during the time stipu lated for the payment of the ransom, should happen to fall in the king's hands by ward, relief, marriage, fine, or escheat, but allow the same to remain entire in the custody of the chamberlain for the use of the king ; and it is added, that they have adopted this resolution, because the non-fulfilment of these condi tions might lead to an utter abrogation of the treaty already in the course of negotiation ; an event which could not fail to bring both disgrace and loss upon the king, the prelates, and the nobility, and destruc tion upon the rest of the kingdom. The proceedings of this important parliament con cluded by an oath, taken by the prelates, lords, and commons who composed it, with their hands upon the holy gospels, that they would, with their whole power, pursue and put down any person whatsoever who should infringe, hinder, or speak evil against any of the resolutions above mentioned ; that they would regard such person as a public enemy, and a rebel against the crown, and, under the penalty of be ing themselves accounted perjured and traitorous per sons, would compel him or them to the due obser vance of the stipulated agreement.1 The Steward 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 101, 102.

A pilgrimage to the shrine of St Thomas a Becket1 detained the pow erful Earls of March and Douglas in England ; but the attendance of the bishops and abbots, of the minor barons and the representatives of the royal burghs, was full and respectable, and the resolutions may be regarded as a very fair criterion of the feel ings and wishes of the kingdom. In consequence of such resolutions, a farther nego tiation took place at London, between the English and Scottish commissioners, in which the heads of a new treaty of peace were debated and drawn out.2 Of this treaty, the principal articles consisted in a proposed truce, for twenty-five years, between the two kingdoms, and an engagement, upon the part of Scot land, to pay into the English treasury a hundred thousand pounds sterling, in full of all demand for ransom, and of all penalties for non-payment at the stated period. In the mean time, until this long truce should be finally settled, a short one of four years was certainly to take place, during which the negotiations for a just and final peace were to pro ceed ; and if, after the lapse of this probationary pe riod, either country preferred war to peace, in that record, which has never been published, will be found in the Ap pendix, letter F.

On these conditions, Edward prorogued the truce from the 20th of May, 1365, for the space of four years,2 \u2014 anxious to employ this interval of peace in renewed intrigues for the subjugation of the coun try. In less than a month after this prorogation, a par liament was held at Perth, in the hall of the Domi nican convent, in presence of the king, where the result of the latest conferences between the Scottish and English commissioners, regarding an ultimate peace, was anxiously debated.3 It was attended by the Bishops of St Andrews, Dunkeld, Moray, Bre chin, and Quhit-hern, the Steward of Scotland, the Earls of Dunbar, Moray, and Douglas, John de Yle, Keith the Marshal, Sir Robert Erskine, Sir Henry de Eglynton, Sir \"William de Haliburton, Sir Roger Mortimer, Sir David Flemyng, John of Argyle, Lord 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Recor. p. 102.

In this parliament many of the nobility and lesser barons do not ap pear to have sat ; and the circumstance of sixty-five of the principal Scottish merchants having received safe-conducts for travelling into England during the course of the preceding year,1 will probably ac count for the absence of the representatives of the burghs from the same assembly. It would appear, from the fragment of an ancient record of its pro ceedings, which is all now left us, that Edward, as one of the bases of a final peace between the two coun tries, had insisted that Scotland, in the event of Eng land being invaded, should assist her ancient enemy with a subsidy of forty men-at-arms and sixty archers, to serve within England, and to be paid by that coun try. This obligation was to be binding upon Scotland for ever ; or, in the event of its not being accepted by England, it was proposed, as an alternative, that David should assist Edward in his Irish war with a body of Scottish troops, who were to serve in Ireland for five years, but only for the space of three months each year. If, on the other hand, Scotland should be invaded by foreigners, an English subsidy of two hundred men-at-arms, and three hundred archers, were promised by Edward for the assistance of his ally, to be supported by Scotland. A reference was finally made to the resolutions drawn up, as the basis of a final peace, in the former parliament, which was 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, p. 885.

The country had been reduced to the lowest pitch of impoverish ment in every branch of national wealth ; and in this condition, by the encouragement which he extended to its merchants,2 the security and protection which were given to the vassals and labourers who lived upon the lands in Scotland subject to himself or to his nobles, and the privileges bestowed on the re ligious houses which had come under his peace,3 he contrived to make them feel, in the most lively man ner, the blessings of peace as contrasted with the com- 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 104. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 897. 16th Oct. 1365.

David and his queen paid repeated visits to the shrine of St Thomas of Canterbury ; the powerful Earl of March repaired to England upon the same pretence ;4 John Barbour, Archdeacon of Aberdeen, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 905. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 896. 15th Aug. 1365. 3 Dillon's History of Peter the Cruel, vol. ii. p. 50. 4 From the extreme frequency of these pilgrimages, and the ab- ruptness with which the rage for them seems to have seized the Scots, I suspect they were political missions under the cloak of re ligion.

In this expectation they were disap pointed. That monarch, as was to be expected, in creased in the insolence of his demands ; and in an assembly of the Scottish council, which took place at the monastery of Holyrood on the 8th of May, when David was, as usual, absent in England,1 the spirit of the nobles who remained true to their country, seems to have gathered courage from despair. They announced, in the strongest possible language, that the propositions of Edward with regard to the homage, the succession, and the demembration of the king dom, could not for a moment be entertained ; that they involved a submission which was altogether inad missible and intolerable ; and that, in the event of the probable rejection of all overtures of peace, the Scottish people, rather than consent to such degra ding terms, were willing to make still greater sacri fices in order to pay off the ransom of their king. For this purpose, they declared themselves ready to submit to an additional tax upon the whole lands in the kingdom, both lay and ecclesiastical ; and it was enacted by the same order of council, that direc tions should be given to the sheriff of each county, to appoint certain days for the appearance of the richest proprietors within his jurisdiction, at which time cer tain persons deputed by the king or the chamberlain should attend, to mark the precise sum which each 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 104.

Preparations for war, orders to the lords marchers to put the Borders in a state of defence, to command an array of all fighting men between sixteen and sixty, and to strengthen and victual the castles on the marches,2 succeeded to these abortive attempts at negotiation ; and it seems to have been confidently expected in England that the Scots would break or renounce the truce, and attack the Border counties. Meanwhile a Parliament was convoked at Scone on the 20th of July,;! which was fully attended by the bishops, ab bots, and priors, by the high lords and lesser barons, as well as the representatives of the royal burghs. 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 104.

The expenses which had been contracted by the in cessant and wasteful visits of David and his queen to the court of Edward; the heavy sums due by the Scot tish commissioners, who had been so long and so fruitlessly engaged in negotiations for peace ; and the very large balance of the ransom which still remain ed unpaid ; formed altogether a load of debt, the pay ment of which was a subject of ceaseless anxiety, and called for new sacrifices. Three years of the short truce had now expired ; yet peace appeared now even more distant than before, and war and bankruptcy were fast approaching. In these circumstances, it was resolved to make a last attempt at negotiation ; and to intrust its management to the same commis sioners, the Bishop of St Andrews, Sir Robert Er skine Wardlaw, Archdeacon of Lothian, and Gilbert Armstrong ; with directions that the articles, already drawn up in the former parliament at Perth,1 should be the basis of their negotiation. If their efforts failed to procure a final peace, they were directed by the Parliament to obtain, if possible, a prolongation of the truce for twenty-five years, on condition that Scotland j)aid annually four thousand pounds in ex tinction of the remainder of the ransom. An exact estimate of the actual value of the whole lands in the kingdom, as distinguished from that denominated the ancient extent, was appointed to be taken. In this census were included the lands belonging to the church, the estates of the nobles and lesser barons, 1 Held on the 13th January, 1364."], [203, "1366. 167 DAVID II. the property of the burghers and merchants, and even the goods of the husbandmen or labourers. From this estimate of property, a special exception is made as before in favour of the \" white sheep,\" which were to pay nothing to the general contribution ; and it was directed that, on a certain day,1 the returns should be given in at Edinburgh to the council ; after which, on summing up the whole, a contribution of eight thou sand marks was to be levied upon the gross rental of the kingdom, to defray the expenses of the king's visits ; to pay off the debts which he had contracted in his own kingdom ; and to cover the charges of the commissioners. As to the L.4000 annually due as ransom money, it was agreed that, until the return of the commissioners, this should be paid out of the great custom which had been set apart for that pur pose in a former parliament. After their return, it was deemed advisable by the parliament that this sum of L.4000 should be taken out of the produce of the general tax upon the property of the kingdom, and that L.2000 out of the same fund be employed to relieve the king from debt, to pay his expenses, and the charges of the commissioners. This last sum was required without delay. It was therefore bor rowed from the barons, clergy, and burgesses, in the proportions of one thousand from the first, six hun dred from the second, and four hundred merks from the last order ; Sir Robert Erskine and Walter Big- 1 Infra festum nativitatis beat\u00e6 virginis. \" Proximo futurum apud Edinburgh,\" viz. 8th September.

Such being the unexampled sacrifices which were cheerfully made by the whole nation, for the relief of the king, and the support of the crown, it was na- tural and just that some reciprocal favours should be granted for the protection of the people. According- ly, at the request of the three Estates, it was express- ly proclaimed, that justice should be administered to the lieges of the realm without favour or partiality, and that whatever writs or letters had been directed from the Chancellary or other court, in the course of the prosecution of any cause or plea, should not be liable to be recalled by the sealed writ of any other officer ; but that the ministers to whom such are addressed were bound to give them full effect, and to return them endorsed to the parties litigant. It was also solemnly stipulated, that no part of the sums collected for the ransom and the expenses of the king, or of his commissioners, should be applied by gift, remis- sion, or otherwise, to any other use ; that the church should be protected in the full enjoyment of their rights and immunities ; and that all opponents to the regular levying of the tithes should be compelled to submit peaceably to their exaction, under the pe nalty of excommunication, and a fine of ten pounds to the king. Nothing was to be taken from the lieges for the use of the king unless upon prompt payment ; and, even when paid for, the royal officers and pur-"], [205, "1366. 169 DAVID II. veyors were bound to exact only what was due by use and custom, and not to make the necessity of the king or their own will the rule of their proceeding. The parliament resolved in the next place, that the rebels in Argyle, Athole, Badenoch, Lochaber, and Ross, and all others who had risen up against the royal authority in the northern parts of the kingdom or elsewhere, should be seized forthwith, and com- pelled to submit themselves to the laws, and to con- tribute their share in the general contribution ; besides being otherwise punished, as appeared best for secu- ring the peace of the community. This brief notice in the Parliamentary Record is the only account which remains of what appears to have been a very serious rebellion of the northern lords, who were encouraged by the present calamitous and distressed state of the kingdom, to throw off their allegiance, at all times precarious, and to refuse to pay their proportion of their contribution for the relief of the kingdom. The principal leaders in this commotion were the Earl of Ross, Hugh de Ross, John of the Isles, John of Lorn, and John de Haye, who positively refused to attend the parliament, and remained in stern independence upon their own estates. All sheriffs and inferior magistrates, as well with in as without burgh, were commanded to obey the chamberlain and other superior authorities, under the penalty of a perpetual removal from their offices. It was specially directed that no barons or knights, 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 105,"], [206, "170 1366. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. travelling through the country with horse or at tendants, should permit their followers to insist upon quarters with the inferior clergy, or the farmers and husbandmen, so as to destroy the crops and meadows and consume the grain ; that they should duly and justly pay their expenses to the inns where they bait ed or took up their residence ; and that the chamber lain shall take care that, in every burgh, such inns be erected and maintained according to the wealth of the place. No prelate, earl, baron, knight, or other per son, lay or clerical, was permitted to ride through the country with a greater following or suite than be came their rank ; and, under pain of imprisonment, such persons were enjoined to dismiss their bodies of spearmen and archers, unless due cause for the attend ance of such a force was shown to the king's officers. All remissions for crimes or offences granted by the king were declared to be null and cancelled, unless the fine was paid within the year from the date of the pardon ; and it was finally directed, that these regu lations for the good of the state should be reduced to writing under the royal seal, and publicly proclaimed by the sheriffs in their respective counties.1 In consequence of the resolutions in this Parlia ment, an attempt appears to have been made to pro cure a peace, which, as usual, concluded in disap pointment, and only entailed additional expense upon 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, pp. 105, 106.

Orders were issued to the Bishop of Durham to fortify Norham, and hold himself in readiness to resist an invasion of the Scots ; Gilbert Umfraville was commanded to reside upon his lands in Northumberland ; an array was ordered of all fighting men between the ages of sixteen and sixty ;- and Henry Percy was enjoined to inspect the state of the castles upon the Marches, and in the Anglicised part of Scotland. It happened, unfortunately for that country, at a time when unanimity and a combination of their ut most strength were absolutely necessary upon the part of the Scottish nobles, that their petty feuds and jea lousies should again break out with renewed strength and viridence. During the long captivity of David, and the consequent wild and disorganized state of his dominions, the pride and power of these feudal barons had proceeded to a pitch, destructive of all regular subordination, \u2014 they travelled through the country with the pomp and military array of sovereigns ; affected the style and title of princes ; and, at their will and pleasure, refused to attend the parliament,3 or to contribute their share to the relief of the king and the people.

The Earl of Douglas, one of the most power ful nobles in Scotland, along with the Earl of March, who held the keys of the kingdom on the Borders, and the Earl of Ross, a baron of the most formidable strength in the north, proudly absented themselves from parliament ; and soon after, Douglas, with a re tinue of four-and-twenty horse, obtained a safe-con duct from Edward to travel into England, and be yond seas ; whilst his example in deserting his coun try was imitated by a body of thirteen Scottish clerks and barons, attended by a body of seventy-five horse.2 In the battle of Nagera in Spain, fought a short time before this, between Edward the Black Prince, and Peter the Cruel, against Henry of Transtamarre, many Scots were in the army of Henry ; and we have already seen that, some time before the same period, there appear to have been frequent emigrations of 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 924. 16th October, 1368. 2 Ibid. vol. i. pp. 915, 916. 16th and 26th October, 1367."], [209, "1367. DAVID II. 173 Scottish adventurers to join the Teutonic knights in Prussia.1 These, however, were not the only distressing con sequences attendant on the long captivity of the king. The patrimony of the crown had been grievously di lapidated during the period of misrule and confusion, which, notwithstanding all the efforts of the Steward, succeeded the battle of Durham. It was no longer what it had once been. Its rents and customs ; its du ties and its fines ; its perquisites and privileges, had been gradually disused, or silently encroached upon ; and in some instances, its lands had probably been seized, or made the subject of sale or gift ; so that, from the actual want of funds, the king found it dif ficult to live in Scotland, or to support, as it became him, the expenses of his royal establishment, without a constant and oppressive taxation ; and this, per haps, is the best excuse, although a very insufficient one, for his frequent visits to England, and long re sidences in that country. As far back as 1362, we find that David's first queen had been under the ne cessity of pawning her jewels for debt; and, only four years after, her royal consort was compelled to adopt the same painful expedient.2 This defalcation in the royal revenue amounted at length to a serious grievance ; and a parliament was summoned at Scone, on the 27th of September, 1 Dillon's History of Peter the Cruel, vol. ii. p. 50. 2 Compotum Camerarii Scoti\u00e6, pp. 395, 464."], [210, "1367- 174 HISTORY\" OF SCOTLAND. 1367,' for the purpose of taking the subject into con sideration. It was determined that, to defray the expenses of the royal establishment, and to enable the king to live without oppressing the people, the pa trimony of the crown must be restored to the condi tion in which it stood in the time of Robert the Bruce and Alexander the Third ; and that all the rents, duties, payments in kind, customs, perquisites and emoluments, with all the reversions, and debts, or fines, which, having accrued to it in the interval between the death of these monarchs and the present day, had been grievously dilapidated, should be forth with reclaimed. It was declared, with that short sighted and sweeping spirit of legislation which marks a rude age, and a gross contempt of the rights of third parties ; \u2014 that if these rents or duties belonging to the crown had been disposed of, by grant, farmed out upon lease, for a tract of years ; or, under certain con ditions or limitations, had been entirely abolished ; or, if the crown-lands had been let, either by the king or his chamberlain, still, such was the urgency of the case, that eA^ery thing was, by the speediest possible process, to be restored to it, as if no such transaction had ever taken place ; all such leases, limitations, gifts, or private contracts, were pronounced null and void, and the whole patrimony was restored full and entire, 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 108. 27th Sept. 1367.

All lands in ward, all the feudal casualties, due upon the marriage of crown vassals, with the escheats and fines or perquisites of courts, were to remain in the hands of the chamberlain for the king's use ; and if the sovereign was anxious to promote or reward any individual, this was directed to be done out of the movable property of the crown, and with the advice of the privy council. All deeds or charters, by which such dilapidations of the pro perty of the crown had been made, either in the time of Robert Bruce, or of the present king, were order ed by the parliament to be delivered into the exche quer at Perth, to remain in the hands of the chancel lor and the chamberlain, and any such deeds not so delivered upon the appointed day, were abrogated, and declared to be of no force or effect in all tinie coming.' In the same parliament, a wise and salutary regu lation was introduced with regard to those lands and estates in Scotland, which, as has been already men tioned, were at this time in the hands of the enemy. It was declared, that, as several large districts in the different counties of the kingdom had long been* and still were, \" under the peace\" of the King of Eng land, in which there were diverse lands holding in ca pite of our lord the king, and of which the rightful heirs have remained in Scotland his faithful and liege subjects, it was deemed expedient by the parliament, 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 108."], [212, "176 1367- HISTORY\" OF SCOTLAND. as soon as the regular forms have been complied with, and such persons found by a jury to be the true and lawful heirs, that they should be entitled to re ceive letters of sasine to be directed to the sheriffs of the counties where the lands lay, which officers were commanded to give sasine to the true proprietors in their respective courts. Such sasine was pronounced to be in every respect as valid to themselves and their heirs, as if the feudal ceremony had taken place upon the lands themselves ; nor was their possession by the enemy, for however long a period, to operate to the loss or prejudice of their true proprietors.1 Still clinging eagerly to the hopes of peace, and well aware from experience, of the evils of a protract ed war, the parliament recommended a renewal of the negotiations on this subject, and empowered the king and his privy council to choose commissioners, and to impose a tax for the payment of their expenses, with out the necessity of calling a new parliament, and obtaining its sanction for their proceedings.2 The greater the anxiety, however, which was manifested by the Scots, the less likely was Edward to listen to their representations, or to indulge them so long as they asserted their independence, with any hopes of a permanent peace. Two attempts at negotiation, which were made within the space of a few months, by the same commissioners who had hitherto been so eminently unsuccessful in all their diplomatic under- 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 109. 2 Ibid. p. 109. 16"], [213, "1367. DAVID II. 177 takings, ended in new and more intolerable demands upon the part of Edward, and a determined refusal by the Scottish parliament to entertain them for a moment.1 This, however, did not prevent the king and his consort from setting out on their usual visit to England. With a retinue of a hundred knights, and a splendid and numerous body of attendants, they travelled to the shrine of St Thomas of Canter- bury, and in this foolish parade of pleasure and devo- tion, incurred a deeper load of debt, at the very time that their poverty had become the subject of parlia- mentary inquiry, and when they could not venture to visit England without a royal protection from ar- rest.2 The sums thus idly thrown away, on their return had to be wrung out of the hard-earned pro- fits of the commercial and labouring classes of the community, in a country already wasted and impo- verished by a long war ; and it is difficult to find terms sufficiently strong to reprobate such unworthy conduct upon the part of a sovereign, who already owed so much to his people. The state of Scotland, and the relations between that country and England, at the present period, were of a very extraordinary nature. There was a perpe tual amicable correspondence between the merchants of both countries ; and a commercial intercourse of unexampled activity, especially upon the part of Scot- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 916, 28th Oct. 1367, and 917; 22d Jan. of the same year.

But much of this was hollow. Orders to the English wardens to strengthen the castles on the marches, to summon the vassals who were bound to give suit and service, to call out the array of all who were able to bear arms between the ages of sixteen and sixty, and repeated commands to the lords marchers to be ready to repel the enemy at a moment's warning, occur in the midst of these pacific and commercial regidations, and give ample proof that a spirit of determined hostility still lurked under all these fair appearances. Yet Edward, from the calamitous circumstances in which the coun try was placed, had a strong hold over Scotland. The king's extreme unpopularity with the people, the load of personal debt contracted by himself and his queen, and the constant irritation and jealousy with which he continued to regard the High Steward, whom he still kept in prison,1 rendered any lengthened resi dence in his own dominions peculiarly unpleasant ; and in this manner not only did the breach between 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 380.

The nation had already been weighed down by a load of taxation which it was little able to bear ; some of the strongest castles and most extensive districts on the marches were possessed by English soldiers ; the northern parts of the kingdom were in actual re bellion ; many of the islands in the western seas were occupied and garrisoned by the English ;: and Ed ward possessed the power of cutting off the only source of Scottish wealth, by prohibiting the com mercial intercourse between the two countries. We are not to wonder, then, at the sanguine hopes which this able monarch appears to have entertained, of fi nally completing the reduction of Scotland, but rather to admire the unshaken perseverance with which, under every disadvantage, this country continued to resist, and finally to defeat, his efforts. In a parliament held at Scone in the summer of the year 1368,2 whose spirited rejection of the condi tions of subjection and dependence proposed by Ed ward, has been already alluded to, the rebellion of the northern parts of the kingdom, and the most ef fectual methods of reducing these wild districts to obedience, were anxiously considered.

Isles, one of the most powerful of the refractory chiefs, had married a daughter of the Steward of Scotland,1 who was considered, therefore, as in some measure responsible for his son-in-law ; and David, probably not unwilling to implicate this high officer as a disturber of the peace of the kingdom, addressed him in person, and charged him, with his sons the Lords of Kyle and Menteith, to defend his liege sub jects within the territories over which their authori ty extended, and to put down the rebellion which had arisen, that in the event of war, the estates of the kingdom might there have a safe place of retreat ; an expression strongly descriptive of the desperate con juncture to which the affairs of the country were re duced.2 John of the Isles, Gillespie Campbell, and John of Lorn, were commanded to present them selves before the king, and to give security for their future pacific conduct, so that they and their vassals should no longer alarm and plunder the land, but, along with their equals and neighbours, submit to the labours and the burdens imposed upon them by the laws. There is something striking and melancholy in the tone of the parliament, where mention is made of the feuds amongst the nobility ; and a hopelessness of relief appears in the expressions which are employed, evincing, very unequivocally, how far above the reach of parliamentary remonstrance or command these petty sovereigns had raised themselves.

The king is recommended to hold a council with the Earls of March and Douglas, the wardens of the east marches, although, it is added, these barons are little disposed to labour for the com mon weal. The chamberlain, assisted by a commit tee of four knights of soldierly talent and experience, was directed to visit, in the first place, the royal cas tles of Lochleven, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dum barton, and to give orders for their being completely repaired, garrisoned, victualled, and provided with warlike engines and other necessaries for defence ; after which, the remaining castles in the kingdom were to be carefully surveyed, and put into a state of effectual resistance.1 But the strength and acti vity in the royal authority, which was absolutely requisite to carry these wise regulations into effect, were at this time pre-eminently wanting in Scotland ; and, nine months after this, when the great council of the nation again assembled,2 the rebellion in the north was still only partially extinguished.

The Steward of Scotland, also, who attended the parliament in person with his two sons, came under the same obligation for the divisions of Athole, Stra thern,Menteith, and other lands in the northern parts of the kingdom ; but John of the Isles proudly re fused to submit, and, in the wild and inaccessible do mains over which his authority extended, defied the royal power, and insisted that his islanders wrere not bound to contribute their portion to the public burdens. The truce w7as now within a single year of its expiry ; and many districts of the country, by the ravages of Border war, and by long neglect of cul ture, were unable to pay the contributions, upon which its continuance could alone be secured. To pre vent the misery of a famine in some places, Edward permitted the distressed inhabitants to purchase the common necessaries of life in England ; and, to such a height had the dearth proceeded, that it was found necessary to import from that country, under a royal license, the most ordinary supplies which were requi red for the use of David's household.1 Yet, in the midst 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 924. 930."], [219, "1369.

Edward, irritated at the contempt evinced by Charles the Fifth for the most solemn articles in the treaty of Bretigny, again plun ged into a war with France, in which the successes of Du Guesclin soon convinced him, that a concentra tion of his whole strength would be absolutely re quired to restore his affairs in that country to any thing like their former prosperity. Peace to him be came now as necessary as to the Scots ; and the im periousness of his demands experienced an immediate relaxation. There was now no longer any mention of those degrading terms of subjection and dismember ment, which had been so indignantly repelled by the Scottish parliament; and the English monarch at last consented to a treaty, by which the truce be tween the kingdoms was renewed for the space of fourteen years.2 Fifty-six thousand merks of the 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 1 14.

As to the estates in the coun ty of Roxburgh, which were then in possession of English subjects, who claimed them as their lawful inheritance, and the inhabitants of which had come under the peace of the English king, a regulation was made, by which one-half of their rents was to be received by the Scottish proprietors, who had been dispossessed by the superior power of England ; while at the same time the lands, with their tenantry and vassals, were to remain in the same state of fealty and obedience to Edward and his heirs in which they now were, and to be justly and loyally governed by the advice and consent of a council of English and Scottish subjects.1 Some time before affairs took this favourable turn, the condition of the northern districts, and the con duct of John of the Isles, again called for the serious and immediate interference of government.

In a short time, the expectation of reward, and the thirst for power and distinction, im planted the seeds of disunion and war amongst these rebel chiefs, and they gradually wrought out their own destruction ; so that, the leaders of the rebellion being cut off, their dominions were easily reduced into a state of quiet and subjection.1 Soon after the king's return from an expedition which he had undertaken in the depth of winter, and conducted with great ability and success, a par liament was assembled at Scone, for the purpose of taking into consideration the state of the kingdom, the expenses of the royal household, and the ad ministration of justice to the lieges. In the parlia ment which had been held at Perth in the prece ding year,2 an expedient had been adopted, apparently for the first time, by which part of the community of Estates were allowed to absent themselves, after they had chosen certain persons amongst the prelates and barons, who might deliver judgment in the pleas of law, and consult upon the general business of the nation. In this parliament, the same measure was 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 380. 2 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 113."], [223, "1369- DAVID II. 187 repeated, with greater formality and distinctness. A committee, consisting of six of the clergy, amongst whom were the Bishop of Brechin, the Chancellor, and the Chamberlain John de Carrie, fourteen of the barons, and seven of the burgesses, was appointed to deliberate, and give their judgment, upon all such ju dicial questions and complaints as necessarily came for decision before the parliament. To a second com mittee, including in its numbers the clergy and the barons alone, was intrusted the management of cer tain special and secret affairs touching the king and the nation, which it was not deemed expedient, in the first instance, to communicate to the parliament at large : a dangerous and somewhat despotic innova tion upon the freedom of the great council of the na tion ; indeed had this change been introduced earlier in the present reign, it would have placed an instrument in the hands of the king, and the corrupted part of the nobility, which might have been directed with fatal success against the independence of the country. This second committee consisted of six of the clergy and eleven of the barons, with such other members as the king chose to select ; and it was specially or dained, that no person whatever, however high his rank, should be permitted to introduce into the coun cil of parliament, or the privy council, any member as his adviser or assessor, unless such as had been chosen by the general vote of the parliament. The necessity of this secrecy as to the affairs which came before the committee intrusted with the consi deration of the king's debts, was soon apparent, and the object of excluding the representatives of the"], [224, "1369. 188 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. royal burghs from this committee could not be mis taken. It was declared, that all the debts of the king, throughout the whole realm, which had been contracted up to the period of the Exchequer Court, held at Perth, at the Epiphany, in the year 1368, were remitted and cancelled ; that from this date, and in all time coming, whatever was borrowed for the ransom or the royal expenses should be promptly paid ; and that no customs, services, or perquisites, should be levied by the king's officers for the aid of the crown, but according to the ancient and establish ed practice of the realm. In this manner, by the very first public act of this partial and unconstitutional committee, were the great principles of good faith most wTantonly sacrificed, and the rights of the mer cantile classes, who had advanced their money, or sold their goods, for the royal use, trampled upon and outraged, by an act which was as mean as it was unjust. In the next place, as to the public burdens, an at tempt was made, in consequence of the northern parts of the kingdom having been reduced under the king's authority, to equalize the taxation over the whole country. To pacify the dangerous murmurs of the Lowland districts, which produced wool, and paid on every sack a heavy tax to the crown, it was de termined, that in those upper counties where this tax was not collected, because sheep had not been intro duced,1 but which abounded in agricultural produce, 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, pp. 109, 113.

The extensive estates, or rather dominions, of John of Lorn, John of the Isles, and Gillespie Camp bell, with the territories of Kintyre, Knapdale, and Arran, were the lands where the new regulation was enforced. It was ordained in this parliament, that no native subject or foreigner, of whatever rank he may be, shall export money, either of gold or silver, out of the country, always excepting such sums as are necessary for the travelling expenses of those who have been permitted to leave the realm, unless he pay forty pennies upon every pound to the king's exchequer ; and with regard to those who make a trade of pur chasing horses, cows, or other animals for exporta tion, they were commanded to pay a duty of forty pence upon every pound of the price of the horse, and twelve pence upon the price of all other animals ; for which tax the sheriffs and bailies of burghs shall be responsible in their accounts to the king's exchequer. In the event of any contravention of the regulations as to the export of the coin, the person so offending was fined twenty shillings upon every penny of the duty which he had eluded ; a strict investigation was of 20th July, 1366, (Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 105) was intended probably, as an encouragement to the introduction of a new breed."], [226, "190 1369- HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ordained to be made of all such defaulters, in order that the quantity of coin which had been carried out of the kingdom might be accurately determined ; and they were directed to be tried by indictment be fore the Justiciar : as grievous complaints had pro ceeded, from every county in the kingdom, against the malversation and extortion of the mairs, sergeants, and other officers of the crown ; and such grave and weighty accusations had even been made to the king in person, it w7as judged expedient to adopt some de cided measures against this evil. Accordingly, or ders were given to the justiciars and chamberlains, in their several counties, to cause all persons who, since the period of the king's captivity, had enjoy ed these offices, whether they held their situations by fee, or as substitutes, or for a limited time, to ap pear before them on a certain day, previous to the conclusion of the present parliament, when an inves tigation was to be made, before the three Estates, of the exact amount of the loss which the king had sustained by their malversation. All who were in this manner detected of such base practices, were or dered to be imprisoned, and to lose their offices for the whole period of their lives.1 The justiciars, she riffs, and other inferior judges, were strictly com manded not to give execution to any mandate under any seal whatever, not excepting the great or the privy seal, if such mandate is contrary to the law of the realm : an order indicating a veiy corrupted state of public justice ; and the merchants and burgesses 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, pp. 117, 118."], [227, "1369. DAVID II. 191 were enjoined not to leave the kingdom without li cense from the king or the chamberlain. Such were the only important regulations which were passed in this parliament, the last which was held by David the Second.1 The same year was rendered remarkable by the divorce of the queen ; an incident, of which the private history is involved in much ob scurity. She was beautiful, and apparently fond of admiration. The little we know of her private life proves her to have been expensive, and addicted to costly pilgrimages, in which she was accompanied with a gallant retinue of knights and attendants ; expedi tions, in those times, undertaken for the purposes of pleasure and intrigue, rather than devotion. She ap pears, also, to have been ambitious to interfere in the public affairs of the kingdom ; and we have seen that, not long before this, her influence persuaded the king to cast the Steward and his sons into prison. No thing, however, can be more dark or unsatisfactory than the only notice of this singular event which re mains to us ; and, unfortunately, the public records throw no light upon the transaction. The sen tence of divorce was pronounced in Lent ; but the queen, collecting all her wealth, found means to con vey herself and her treasure, with great privacy, on board a vessel in the Forth, in which she sailed for France, and carried her appeal in person to the Pa pal Court then at Avignon.

The cause disturbed the kingdom ; and was so bitterly contested, that an interdict began to be threatened, when the fair appellant died herself, on her journey to Rome.1 What became of the process, or what judgment was ultimately pronoimced, can not now be discovered ; but, so late as the year 1374, Robert the Second considered the cause of such mo ment, that he dispatched an embassy to Charles the Fifth of France, soliciting that prince to use his in fluence, with the Pope and cardinals, to obtain a fa vourable decree.2 Immediately after the divorce, the High Steward and his sons were liberated from prison, and restored to favour ; while the king, whose life had been devo ted to pleasure, began to think of his sins, and, in the spirit of the age, to meditate an expedition to the Holy Land. For this purpose, he assembled at his court, and in every way favoured and encoura ged, the bravest knights of his time, declaring it to be his intention to appoint a regency, and de part for Palestine, with the purpose of spending the 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 380. 2 Robertson's Index to the Charters, p. 100.

But, in the midst of these vain dreams of chivalry and superstition, a mortal illness seized upon him, which baffled all human skill, and he died in the cas tle of Edinburgh, on the 22d of February, 1371, in the forty-seventh year of his age, and the forty-se cond of his reign. It is painful to dwell on the character of this prince ; who was, in every respect, unworthy of his illustrious father. It happened, indeed, unfortunate ly for him, that he was promoted to the throne when almost an infant ; and not only lost the advantage of paternal instruction and example, but, by the early death of Douglas and Randolph, was deprived of the only persons who might have supplied the place of a father ; whilst his long exile in France, and a captivity of eleven years, rendered him almost a stranger to his people. Had there, however, been any thing great or excellent in David Bruce, he would have surmounted these disadvantages ; yet we look in vain for a noble, or even a commendable, quality ; whilst the dark er parts of his disposition are prominently marked. He was uniformly actuated by a devotion to his own selfish pleasures, and a reckless disregard of all those sacred and important duties which a king owes to his people. His understanding was one of very limited and moderate power ; and, while he formed his opinions upon hasty and superficial views, he was both obstinate in adhering to them when evi dently erroneous, and capricious in abandoning them before they were proved to be ill-founded.

It was the solitary quality which he inherited from his father ; and of this he gave a memorable proof, in his proposal to alter the order of succession in favour of an English prince, \u2014 a measure of singular baseness and audacity. It is this that forms the darkest blot upon his me mory. His love of pleasure, and devotion to beauty, will find an excuse in many hearts ; his extravagance may be called kingly, even when supported by bor rowed money : but it can never be palliated or for gotten, that he was ready to sacrifice the indepen dence of the kingdom to his love of his own person al liberty, and his animosity against the Steward, \u2014 that the most solemn oaths, by whieh he was bound to his people, were lightly regarded, when brought in competition with these selfish and sordid passions. Such a monarch as this, who, at the mature age of forty-seven, evinced no real symptoms of amendment, was little likely to improve in his latter years ; and it is humiliating to think, that the early death of the only son of Robert the Bruce must have been regard ed as a blessing, rather than a calamity, by his coun try."], [231, "A HISTORICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE ANCIENT STATE OF SCOTLAND ; EMBRACING PRINCIPALLY THE PERIOD FROM THE ACCESSION OF ALEXANDER THE THIRD TO THE DEATH OF DAVID THE SECOND."], [232, ""], [233, "CHAP.

We must be careful not to permit the ideas which are derived from the condition of Scotland in the pre sent day, to influence our conclusions as to its appear ance in those rude and early ages of which we have been writing. No two pictures could be more dissi milar than Scotland in the thirteenth and fourteenth, and Scotland in the nineteenth century. The moun tains, indeed, and the rivers, are stern and indomita ble features of nature, upon which the hand of man can introduce but feeble alterations ; yet, with this exception, every thing was different. The face of the country was covered by immense forests chiefly of oak, in the midst of which, upon the precipitous banks of rivers, or on rocks which formed a natural fortifi cation, and were deemed impregnable by the military art of that period, were placed the castles of the feu dal barons. One principal source of the wealth of the proprietors of these extensive forests consisted in the noble timber which they contained, and the deer \u25a0and other animals of the chase with which they abounded. When Edward I. subdued and overran the country, we find him in the constant practice of repaying the services of those who submitted to his"], [236, "200 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. authority, by presents of so many stags and oaks from the forests which he found in possession of the crown. Thus, on the 18th of August, 1291, the king directed the keeper of the Forest of Selkirk to deliver thirty stags to the Archbishop of St An drews, twenty stags and sixty oaks to the Bishop of Glasgow, ten to the High Steward, and six to Brother Brian, Preceptor of the Order of Knights Templars in Scotland.1 To mark the names, or define the exact limits of these huge woods, is now impossible ; yet, from the public records, and the incidental notices of authentic historians, a few scattered facts may be collected. In the north, we find the forest of Spey,2 extend ing along the banks of that majestic river ; the forests of Alnete, and of Tarnaway, of Awne, Kilblene, Langmorgan, and of Elgin, Forres, Lochindorb, and Inverness.3 The extensive county of Aberdeen ap pears to have been covered with wood. We meet there with the forests of Kintore, of Cardenache, Drum or Drome, Stocket, Killanal, Sanquhar, Tul loch, Gasgow, Darrus, Collyn, and what is called the New Forest of Innerpeffer.4 In Banff was the fo rest of Boyne ; in Kincardine and Forfar the forests 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 3. 18th August, 1291. 2 Ibid. vol. i. p. 5.

Such, indeed, was, at an early period, the extent and impervious nature of these woods, that the English, in their invasions, endeavoured to clear the country by fire and by the hatchet ; and Knighton relates, that in an expedition of the Duke of Lan caster into this country, in the reign of Richard the Second, this prince, having recourse to these methods, employed in the work of destruction so immense a multitude, that the stroke of eighty thousand hatchets might be heard resounding through the forests, whilst the fire was blazing and consuming them at the same moment.1 So utterly erroneous is the opinion of one of those conjectural historians, who pronounces that there is little reason to think that in any age, of which an accurate remembrance is preserved, this kingdom was ever more woody than it is now.2 In the times of which we write, however, many districts in the midst of these forests had been cleared of the wood, and brought under cultivation. Thus, in the Forest of Plater, in the county of Forfar, David the Second, in 1366, made a grant of four ox gangs of arable land for a reddendo of a pair of white gloves, or two silver pennies, to Murdoch del Rhynd.3 In the same forest, the monks of Restennet, at the death of Alexander the Third, enjoyed the tenth of 1 Knighton apud Twysden, vol. ii. p. 2674.

Where the mountains sunk down into the plain, and the country stretched itself into a level, mossy fens of great extent occupied those fertile and beautiful districts which are now drained and brought under cultivation.5 Within tbe inaccessible windings of these morasses, which were intersected by roads known only to the inhabitants, Wallace and Bruce, during the long war of liberty, frequently defended themselves, and defied the heavy-armed English ca- ' MS.

The royal castles must have presented an addi tional and imposing feature in the external appear ance of the country at this period. Built chiefly for strength and resistance during a time of war, these fortresses were the great garrisons of the coun try, and reared their immense walls, and formida ble towers and buttresses in those situations which nature had herself fortified, and where little was to be done by man, but to avail himself of the power already placed in his hand. In the year 1292, when Edward, after his judgment in favour of Baliol, gave directions to his English captains to deliver the royal castles into the hands of the new king, we find these to have been twenty-three in number. On the Borders wrere the castles of Jed burgh, Roxburgh, and Berwick ; those of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Wigton, Ayr, Tarbart,2 Dumbar ton and Stirling, formed a semicircle of fortresses which commanded the important districts of Annan dale, Galloway, Carrick, Kyle, Lanark, and the coun try round Stirling, containing the passes into the Highlands. Between Stirling, Perth, and the Tay, there was no royal castle, till we reach Dundee, where Brian Fitz-Alan commanded ; after which the castles of Forfar, Kincardine, and Aberdeen, protect ed and kept under the counties of Perth, Angus, Kin- 1 Palgravc's Parliamentary Writs, Chronological Abstract, p. 76.

In this manner the architecture of the strong Norman castles, which had already been partially introduced by the Scoto-Norman barons, was more effectually taught by their formidable enemy to the Scots, who profited by the lesson, and turned it against himself. It not unfrequently happened, that the siege of a baronial castle detained the whole Eng lish army for weeks, and even months, before it ; and although feebly garrisoned, that the single strength of its walls resisted and defied the efforts of Edward's strongest machines, and most skilful engineers. To enumerate or to point out the situation of the baro nial castles which at this early period formed the re sidences of the feudal nobility and their vassals, would 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 11, 12."], [242, "206 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. be almost impossible. They raised their formidable towers in every part of the kingdom, on its coasts and in its islands, on its peninsulas and in its lakes, upon the banks of its rivers, and on the crests of its mountains ; and many of those inhabited by the higher nobility rivalled, and in their strength and extent sometimes surpassed, the fortresses belonging to the king.1 In the year 1309, when the military talents of Bruce had wrested from England nearly the whole of the royal castles, we find Edward the Second wri ting earnestly to his principal officers in Scotland, directing them to maintain their ground to the last extremity against the enemy ; and it is singular that, with the exception of Edinburgh, Stirling, Dumfries, and Jedburgh, the posts which they held, and which are enumerated in his order, are all of them private baronial castles, whose proprietors had either been compelled by superior force, or induced by selfish considerations to embrace the English interest. In his letters are mentioned the castle of Kirkintulloch, between Dumbarton and Stirling ; Dalswynton in Galloway, a principal seat of the Comyns ; Karlave rock, belonging to the Maxwells ; Thybres or Tibris Castle, also in Galloway ; Lochmaben, in Annandale, the seat of the Bruces ; Butil, the property of the Steward ; Dunbar, a strong and magnificent castle, 1 Fordun, in speaking of the death of Edward the First, asserts 3 that within six years of that event, Bruce had taken and cast down a hundred and thirty-seven castles, fortalices, and towers.

In the vicinity of these strongholds, in which the Scottish barons of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries held their residence, there was cleared from wood as much ground as was necessary for the support of that nu merous train of vassals and retainers, which formed what was termed the \" following\" of their lord, and who were supported in a style of rude and abundant hospitality.

Around these castles, also, were placed the rude habitations and cottages belonging to the more immediate servants and inferior dependents of the baron, to his armourers, tailors, wrights, ma sons, falconers, forest-keepers, and many others, who ministered to his necessities, his comforts, or his plea sures. It happened, too, not unfrequently, that, am bitious of the security which the vicinity of a feudal castle ensured, the free farmers or opulent tradesmen of those remote times requested permission to build their habitations and booths near its walls, which, for payment of a small rent, was willingly allowed ; and we shall afterwards have occasion to remark, that to this practice we perhaps owe the origin of our towns and royal burghs in Scotland. It appears, also, from the authentic evidence of the Cartularies, that at this period, upon the large feudal estates belonging to the nobles or to the church, were to be found small vil lages, or collections of hamlets and cottages, termed Vill\u00e6 in the charters of the times, annexed to which was a district of land called a Territorium.1 This was cultivated in various proportions by the higher ranks of the husbandmen, who possessed it, either in part or in whole, as their own property, which they held by 1 MS. Cartulary of Melrose, pp. 21, 22.

Thus, by a similar process, which we find took place in England under the Nor mans, and which is very clearly to be traced in Domes day Book, the greater feudal barons were possessed not only of immense estates, embracing within them field and forest, river, lake, and mountain, but of nu merous and flourishing villages,2 for which they recei ved a regular rent, and of whose wealth and gains they always held a share, because they were frequently the masters of the persons and property of the tradesmen and villeyns, by whom such early communities were inhabited. In these villages the larger divisions, un der the names of caracutes, bovates, or oxgates, were cultivated by the husbandmen, and the cottars under them, while, for their own maintenance, each of these poor labourers was the master of a cottage, with a small piece of ground, for which he paid a trifling rent to the lord of the soil.3 1 Cartulary of Kelso, p. 257, in 1258.

It happened not unfrequently, that the high eccle siastics, or the convents and religious houses, were the proprietors of villages, from whose population there was not exacted the same strict routine of military service, which was due by the vassals of the temporal barons ; and the consequences of this ex emption were seen in the happier and more improved condition of their husbandmen and villeyns, and in the richer cultivation of their ample territories. A great portion of the district attached to these villages was divided into pasture-land and woodland, in which a right of pasturage, for a certain number of animals, belonged to each of the villagers or husbandmen in common. It is from the information conveyed in the Cartularies that the condition of these early vil lages is principally to be discovered.1 Thus, for example, in the village of Bolden, in Roxburghshire, which belonged to the monks of Kelso, in the latter part of the reign of Alexander the Third, there were twenty-eight husbandmen, who possessed each a husbandland, with common pasture ; for which he paid a rent of six shillings and eightpence, be sides various services which were due to the landlord. There were, in the same village, thirty-six cottagers each of whom held nearly half an acre of arable land, with a right of common pasture. The united rent paid by the whole cottagers amounted to fifty-five shil lings ; in addition to which, they were bound to per form certain services in labour. To the village there was attached a mill, which gave a rent of eight merks ; 1 Rotulus Reddituum Monasterii de Kalchow.

This emigration, however, of the cottars or villeyns from one part of the country, or from one village to another, could not be legally effected, with out the express consent of the master to whom they belonged. A fact, of which we shall be convinced, when we come to consider the condition of the great body of the people in those early ages. To one casting his eye over Scotland, as it existed during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the numerous religious establishments, the cathedrals, convents, monasteries, and episcopal palaces, must have formed another striking feature in the exter nal aspect of the country. Situated always in the richest, and not unfrequently in the most picturesque, spots, and built in that imposing style of Gothic ar chitecture, which is one of the greatest triumphs of the Middle Ages, these noble structures reared their holy spires, and antique towers, in almost every dis trict through which you travelled ; and your approach to them could commonly be traced by the high agri- 1 Cartulary of Kelso, pp. 478, 479.

The woods, enclosed and protected, were of loftier growth; the meadows and cornfields richer, and better cultivated ; the population inhabiting the church-lands more active, thriving, and industrious than in the lands belonging to the crown, or to the feudal nobility. To give any correct idea of the number, or the opulence, of the various episcopal and conventual es tablishments which were to be found in Scotland at this remote era, would require a more lengthened dis cussion than our present limits will allow. Besides the bishopricks, with their cathedral churches, their episcopal palaces, and the residences of the minor clergy, which were attached to them, our early mo narchs, and higher nobility, in the superstitious spi rit of the age, encouraged those various orders of re gular and secular churchmen, which then swarmed over Europe. The Canons Regular of St Augus tine, who were invited into Scotland by Alexander the First, and highly favoured by David, had not less than twenty-eight monasteries ; the Cistertians or Bernardine monks, who were also very warmly pa tronised by David, possessed thirteen ; and the Do minican or Black Friars fifteen monasteries, in va rious parts of the country. Although these orders were the most frequent ; yet numerous other divi sions of canons, monks, and friars, obtained an early settlement in Scotland ; and erected for themselves, in many places, those noble abbacies, priories or con vents, whose ruins, at the present day, are so full of 11"], [249, "APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTRY. 213 picturesque beauty, and interesting associations. The Red Friars, an order originally instituted for the re demption of Christian slaves from the Infidels, pos sessed eight monasteries ; the Pr\u00e6monstratensian Monks, who boasted, that the rule which they fol lowed was delivered to them in a vision by St Augus tine, and written in golden letters, were highly fa voured by David the First, Alexander the Second, and Fergus, Lord of Galloway. The Tyronensian and Clunacensian Monks ; the Templars ; the Fran ciscans, and the Carmelites, had all of them establish ments in Scotland ; whilst the Augustinian, the Be nedictine, and the Cistertian Nuns, were also pos sessed of numerous rich and noble convents ; which, along with the hospitals, erected by the charity of the Catholic church, for the entertainment of pilgrims and strangers, and the cure and support of the sick and infirm, complete the catalogue of the religious es tablishments of Scotland during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.1 Although covered, in many places, with huge and impenetrable woods and marshes, the country, around the monasteries and religious houses, or ad joining to the castles of the nobles, and to the great towns, royal burghs, and villages, in the- reign of Alexander the Third, and previous to the destructive wars which succeeded his death, appears to have been in a state of considerable cultivation. Even du ring the wars of the three Edwards ; when we take 1 Account of the religious houses in Scotland. Keith's Catalogue of the Bishops, p. 235."], [250, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 214 into view the dreadful disadvantages against which it had to struggle, the agriculture of Scotland was very respectable. The Scottish kings possessed royal manors in al most every shire, which were cultivated by their own free tenants and their villeyns ; and to which, for the purpose of gathering the rents, and consuming the agri cultural produce, they were in the custom of repair ing, in their progresses through the kingdom. This fact is established, by the evidence of the Cartula ries, which contain frequent grants, by David the First, AVilliam the Lion, and the two Alexanders, to the convents and religious houses, of various kinds of agricultural produce to be drawn from the royal manors, and the same truth is as conclusively made out by the original accounts of the great chamber lains of Scotland.1 David, for example, granted, to the monks of Scone, the half of the skins, and the fat of all the beasts, which were killed for the king's use, on his lands to the north of the Tay ; and the half of the skins and hides of all the beasts slain, upon festival days, at Stirling, and on his manors between the Forth and the Tay.2 Innumerable charters, by his successors, to the various monasteries and religious houses in the kingdom, evince the generosity or superstition of our monarchs, and the extent of their royal demesnes. Scarcely less numerous, and upon a scale not greatly 1 Of these accounts, which contain a body of information upon the civil history of Scotland, unrivalled in authenticity, and of the highest interest, a short notice will be found in the Appendix, let ter A. 2 Cartulary of Scone, pp. 2, 6, 8."], [251, "215 EARLY AGRICULTURE. inferior to those of the king, were the extensive feu dal estates belonging to the religious houses, to dig nified clergy, and to the magnates, or higher barons of Scotland ; who granted charters of lands to their own military vassals and retainers, or by leases, to other more pacific tenants, upon whom they devol ved the agricultural improvement of their domains. Thus, for example, we find, in the Cartulary of Kel so, that the monks of this rich religious house grant ed to the men of Innerwick, in the year 1190, a thir ty-three years lease of certain woods and lands, for the annual rent of twenty shillings ; which was ap proved of by Alan, the son of Walter the Steward, to whom the men of Innerwick belonged.1 The clergy, whose domains, chiefly from the libe ral and frequent endowments of David the First, and his successors, were, at this period, amazingly rich and extensive, repaid this profusion, by becoming the great agricultural improvers of the country. From them those leases principally proceeded, which had the most beneficial effect in clearing it from wood, and bringing it under tillage. In 1326, the abbot of Scone granted a lease, for life, of his lands of Gilmers land to Andrew de Striveleyn. Henry Whitwell re ceived from the Abbot of Kelso a lease, for life, of all the lands belonging to this monastery in Dumfries shire, for which the yearly rent was twelve shillings ; and numerous other instances might be brought for ward. It was in this manner that there was gradual- 1 Cartulary of Kelso p. 247. Caledonia, vol. i. p. 794."], [252, "216 HISTORY' OF SCOTLAND. ly introduced and encouraged in the country a body of useful improvers, who were permitted, from the pacific character of their landlords, to devote their time much more exclusively to agricultural improve ment than the vassals or tenants of the barons.1 The system of agriculture pursued at this early period, must have been exceedingly rude and simple in its details ; and although it is difficult to point out the exact mode of cultivation, yet some information with regard to its general character, and the crops then raised in the country, may be found in the scat tered notices of contemporary historians, and in the records and muniments of the times. Oats, wheat, barley, pease and beans, were all raised in tolerable abundance. Of these by far the most prevalent crop was oats. It furnished the bread of the lower classes ; and the ale which they drank was brewed from malt made of this grain. In the innumerable mills which are mentioned in the Cartularies, immense quanti ties of oats were ground into meal ; and at the vari ous malt kilns and breweries, which we find attached throughout the same records to the hamlets and vil lages, equally large proportions of oats were reduced into malt and brewed into ale. In the wardrobe ac counts of Edward the First for the years 1299 and 1300, large quantities of oat malt, furnished to his different garrisons in Scotland, form some of the principal items of expenditure. In the same inte- 1 Cartulary of Scone, p. 32. Cartulary of Kelso, p. 329. Chamberlain's Accounts, vol. i. pp. 5, 12, 22. Cartulary of Inch colm, p. 31."], [253, "EARLY AGRICULTURE. 217 resting and authentic record we find that Edward's cavalry, in their return from Galloway, on the 31st of August, 1300, destroyed, in their march through the fields, eighty acres of oats upon the property of William de Carlisle, at Dornock, in compensation of which the king allowed him two hogsheads of wine.1 It appears in the same series of accounts that Edward bought his oats, and oat malt to be brewed for the ar my, at various rates, extending from twentypence to three shillings per quarter. From the multitudes of brew-houses with which every division of the kingdom appears to have been studded, from the royal manu factories of ale down to those in the towns, burghs, ba ronies, and villages, it is evident that this beverage must have been consumed in very great quantities. Although oats was the principal grain raised in Scot land, yet wheat was also cultivated to a considerable extent, chiefly by the higher orders ; throughout the south and east districts of the country, wheaten bread was principally used at their tables ; and the quantities of this grain which the Cartularies show to have been ground in the mills, evince the consumption to have been very considerable. When Edward, in the year 1300, invaded Galloway, we find, by the wardrobe account of that period, that he purchased large quantities of wheat, which was exported from Kirkcudbright to Wliitehaven, and other ports in Cumberland. It was there ground, and the flour sent back to supply the English garrisons in Galloway and Ayr. In the wardrobe account of the same monarch, 1 Liber Cotidianus Gaiderob\u00e6 Edwardi I., p. 126."], [254, "218 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. for the year 1299, it is stated that unground pease, for the use of the English garrisons, were furnished at the rate of two shillings and ninepence, and beans for the horses at four shillings and sixpence, the quarter. In addition to these crops, extensive districts of rich natural meadow, with the green sward which clothed the forest glades, furnished grass, wmich was made into hay, and, with all other agricultural produce, paid its tithe to the clergy. The fields, the mountain grazings, and the forests, were amply stocked with cows, sheep, and large herds of swine,1 which fed on the beech mast. These last formed the staple animal food of the lower classes ; for even the poor bondman or cottager seems to have generally possessed, in the territorium of the village where he lived, a right of common pasture for a sow and her pigs. Another rich and important part of the stocking of the farms and the forests of those times consisted in the nu merous horses which were reared by their baronial proprietors. We learn from the Cartularies that great care was bestowed upon this interesting branch of rural economy. Many of the nobles had breeding studs upon their estates ;2 and, in the forests, large herds of brood mares, surrounded by their grown-up progeny, and with their young foals at their feet, ran wild, and produced a hardy and excellent stock of lit tle horses, upon which the hobelers, or light-armed Scottish cavalry, were mounted, which, in the nume- 1 Excerpt.

Distinguished from these were the domestic horses and mares employed in the pur poses of agriculture,1 in war, or in the chase. Both the wild horses, and those which had been domesti cated, were of a small hardy breed, excellently fitted for light cavalry, but too diminutive to be employed as the great war horse of the knight, which had not only to bear its master armed from head to foot in steel, but to carry likewise its own coat of mail. It is on this account that we find the Scottish barons im porting a breed of larger horses from abroad.2 Some idea may be formed of the extent of the stud pos sessed by the higher barons and the rich ecclesiasti cal houses, by an inventory which is preserved in the Chartulary of Newbottle. It states that the monks of Melrose possessed in old times three hundred and twenty-five forest mares and horses, fifty-four domes tic mares, a hundred and four domestic horses, two hundred and seven stags or young horses, thirty-nine three year colts, and a hundred and seventy-two year old colts. 1 In the farming operations of ploughing and harrowing, in the leading of hay, the carting of peats, or taking in the corn during the harvest, the wain driven by oxen appears to have been principally employed, while the conveyance of the agricultural produce to any great distance was performed by horse labour. This appears from the minute details of the services due by the tenants of the Abbey of Kelso, in the Cartulary of that rich religious house.

But that branch of rural economy upon which the Scottish proprietors of this period bestowed most attention, was the rearing of large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.1 Sheep, indeed, chiefly abounded in the Lowlands ; and, during the latter part of the reign of David the Second, we have seen the parlia ment interposing in order to equalize the taxation of the districts where sheep farming wras unknowm, and the Lowland counties, where the wool tax fell hea vily upon the inhabitants, while, on another occa sion, \" white sheep\" are exempted, probably meaning those sheep which, for the sake of producing a finer quality of wool, had not been smeared with tar.* In a short time, howrever, the northern, as well as the southern districts, abounded in sheep, which became a principal branch of the wealth of the country. Their flesh was consumed at the barons' table ; their wool formed the chief article of export, or was manu factured within the kingdom into the coarser kind of cloth for the farm servants ;3 their skins were tanned and converted into articles for home consumption, or exported to England and Flanders. In like manner, the carcasses of the beeves were consumed by the troops of retainers, or exposed for sale in the market of 1 Excerpta ex Rotulo Compotorum, Temp. Regis Alex. III. p. 11. 2 \" White sheep\" is the technical phrase for sheep which are not smeared with tar in the winter time. The smearing injures the wool ; and it is not improbable the exemption from tax may have been with a view to the production of wool better fitted to the pur poses of the manufacturer.

In the more cultivated districts, cows were kept in the proportion of ten to every plough ; but, in the wilder parts of the country, the number was infinitely greater.1 Goats also were to be found in some dis tricts, chiefly in the wilder and more mountainous parts of the country.2 From the quantity of cheese which appears to have been manufactured on the royal demesnes through out Scotland, it is certain that the dairy formed a principal object of attention ;3 and if such was the case upon the lands of the crown, it is equally cer tain that its proper management and economy was not neglected by the clergy or the barons. In the Cartulary of Kelso, we find that David the First conferred on the monks of that house the tenth of the cheese which he received from Tweeddale ; the same prince gave to the monks of Scone the tenth of the can of his cheese brought in from his ma nors of Gowrie, Scone, Cowper, and Torgrund ; and to the monks of Rendalgross, the tenth of the cheese and corn collected from the district round Perth.4 From the same valuable class of records, which contain the most interesting materials for the civil history of the country, we learn that, in addi- 1 Caledonia, p. 798. * Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 3. 3 Excerpta E.

As early as under Malcolm the Fourth, the monks of Scone, upon the Feast of All Saints, received from every ploughland within their demesnes ten hens, along with other farm produce ; and from each house of every hamlet or village on the lands belonging to the Abbey of Kelso, the Abbot at Christmas received a hen, for which he paid a halfpenny.1 It will be seen, from these facts, that the state of Scotland, with regard to those necessaries, and even comforts of life, which depend upon agricultural im provement, was sufficiently respectable. Wheaten loaves, beef, mutton, and bacon, besides venison and game of all descriptions, in rude abundance, were to be found at the table of the greater and lesser barons, while the lower orders, who could look to a certain supply of pork, and eggs, cheese, butter, ale, and oaten cakes, were undoubtedly, so far as respects these com forts, in a prosperous condition. Besides this, both for rich and poor, there was an inexhaustible supply of fish, which abounded in the seas that washed their coasts, and in the rivers and lakes of the country. Herring and salmon, cod and ling, haddocks, whiting, oysters, trout, eels, and almost every other species of fresh water fish, were caught in great quantities, and 1 Cartulary of Scone, p. 16. Cartulary of Kelso."], [259, "EARLY FISHERIES. 223 formed an article of constant home consumption.1 The pages of the various Cartularies2 abound with proofs of the assiduity and skill with which the fish eries were pursued, and of the value attached to them by their proprietors. In the wardrobe accounts of Edward the First, large quantities of herring were purchased for the provisioning of his Scottish garri sons ; and during his campaigns of 1300 in that coun try, he carried with him his nets and fishers for the supply of the royal table. Here, as in all other branches of national wealth, the monks were the great improvers, and by their skill and enterprise, taught the great barons, and the smaller landed pro prietors, with their vassals and bondmen, how much wealth and comfort might be extracted out of the seas, the lakes, and the rivers of their country. Stell fishings, a word which appears to mean a stationary establishment for the taking of fish, were frequent on the coast of Ayrshire, on the shores of the Solway, and generally at the confluence of the larger rivers with the sea. Besides this, we find in the Cartu laries innumerable grants of retes, or the right of using a single net within certain limits, upon the ri ver or lake where it was established ; and of yairs, a mode of fishing by the construction of a wattled ma chine within the stream of the river, which was in serted between two walls, and of very ancient use in Scotland.

We come now to the consideration of an important subject; to make a few remarks upon the different races of men which appear originally to have settled in Scotland, and the division of orders and ranks in society into which they came to be separated during this remote era of our history. At the death of Mal colm Canmore, in 1093, four distinct races were dis cernible in Scotland. There was first the Gaelic or Celtic people, speaking the Erse language, and in habiting Argyle, Galloway, Inverness, and nearly the whole of Scotland to the north of the Firth of Forth. Beyond them the hardy and warlike Norwe gians had seized upon the Western Isles, and coloni zed the extreme districts of Ross and Caithness. In the richer lowland counties were the Saxons, a Gothic race, from whom Malcolm Canmore had chosen his queen, and whom he highly favoured and encouraged, while the convulsion in the sister country at the great era of the conquest had driven many opulent Nor mans to desert the service of the conqueror, and to carry their arms and their allegiance to a foreign prince, by whom, they were warmly welcomed. During the long interval of a century and a half, which elapsed between the death of Malcolm Can more and the accession of Alexander the Third, these materials became insensibly blended and mixed into VOL. II. P"], [262, "226 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. each other ; but the process was exiremely gradual, and during the whole period we can discern distinct marks of the different races.1 At the death of Mal colm Canmore, an event took place which exhibited in strong colours the animosity of the Gaelic people to the Saxons and Normans. Donald Bane, who had taken refuge in the Hebrides upon the usurpation of Macbeth, having emerged from his northern asylum, seized the throne ; and his first exertion of power was to expel from the country all the foreigners who had intruded into his dominions.2 The frequent re sidence of David the First previous to his accession to the Scottish throne at the court of England, and his possession of the large and extensive district of Cumberland, which was exclusively occupied by a Saxon and Norman population, must have contribu ted to soften the lines of distinction between the dif ferent classes of his subjects when he became king. Yet his anxious efforts could not altogether extinguish then* jealous animosities, or prevent them from break ing out on most occasions where they were compelled to act together.3 For example, at the battle of the Standard, Malise Earl of Strathern, a Gaelic chief, remonstrated with the Scottish king against his de sign of placing his squadrons of Norman soldiers, who were clothed from head to foot in steel, in the front of the battle. \" Why,\" said he to the king, 1 Fordun a Goodal, b. viii. c. 2, 4, and 6, b. ix. c. 34, and c. 47, 48, c. 63. 2 Chron.

I wear no armour, yet none of them this day will go before me in the battle.\" Upon which, David, to prevent a rupture between the two divi sions of his army, found himself compelled to give the post of honour to the Galwegians, whom the Nor man historians represent as a nation of absolute sa vages.1 An attention to the arrangement of the Scottish army in this memorable battle, and to the circumstances under which it was fought, will throw some light upon the various tribes which at this time composed the body of the nation. After the Galwe gians, who insisted on forming the first line, and were led by their chiefs Ulric and Donald, came the second body, which was composed of the Norman men-at arms, the knights and the archers, commanded by Prince Henry, whilst the soldiers of Cumberland and Teviotdale fought in the same line, and beneath the same banner. In the third division were drawn up the men of Lothian, along with the Islanders and Katherans ; and the king himself commanded a re serve in which he had placed the Scots and the natives of Moray, with a select body of Saxon and Norman knights, which he kept near him as a body guard.2 There were at this time in the English army two Nor man barons, Robert de Brus, and Bernard Baliol, who possessed estates in Galloway, which they held of Da vid as their liege lord. Before the battle, Bruce, who 1 Ethelredus de Bello Standards pp. 341, 342. Ricardus Ha gulstad.

In the arguments which he employed, as given by a contem porary historian,1 the enmity between the Scottish and the Norman race, is strongly insisted upon. He paints the Scots as rejoicing at the opportunity of avenging themselves upon a nation which was odious to them, and accuses the king of extreme folly in making war on that people by whom he had supported his power against the attacks of his Scottish subjects. \" Think not,\" says he, \" that one part of these savage tribes will be a sufficient defence against the rest, that the Scots will be barrier enough against the Scots ; and raise not your banner for the destruction of those wThose faithfulness in your defence has made them to be hated by the Scottish race.\" The two races in David's army, thus strikingly de scribed, seem to have been the Galwegians, the Isles men, the Katherans, on one hand ; and the Normans and Saxons, the men of Lothian, of Teviotdale, and of Cumberland, on the other. Nor is it difficult to dis cover the cause of this animosity. The fact just men tioned, that Bruce and Baliol, two Norman barons, possessed lands in Galloway, will guide us to it. It was the policy of this monarch to encourage the in flux of Normans into his dominions, by conferring upon them estates in the districts which his Gaelic 1 Ethelredus de Bello Standards p. 343."], [265, "229 DISTINCT RACES IN SCOTLAND. subjects considered exclusively their own ; and out of this policy arose a mutual jealousy and hatred, which it required centuries entirely to eradicate. The arms, the appearance, and the manners of these Gal wegians, are marked by the same author as essentially different from the rest of the Scottish army. When compared with the Norman men-at-arms, they were little else than naked savages. Their swords and a buckler of cow hide were their feeble weapons of de fence against the steel casques, the chained-mail shirts, the cuirass, vantbrace, greaves, and iron gloves of the English army ; but their first attack, in spite of these disadvantages, was so fierce as to be frequently suc cessful. On the other hand, the Saxons and the men of Teviotdale, Cumberland, and Lothian, appear to have been a civilized and noble race, in comparison with the Galwegians, the Islesmen, and the Kathe- rans.1 The distinction indeed between the Saxon and the Gaelic people was as strongly marked as that between the Normans and the Galwegians. Malcolm's queen was a Saxon princess, and the sister of Edgar Athe ling, the heir of the Saxon line in England.

Bruce's expedition against the Western Isles in 1315, which was followed by a temporary reduction of the chiefs, evinces the continued feelings of hostility, and almost the only occasion on which David the Second evinced a spirit worthy of his father, was in the sup pression of a serious rebellion of the northern pro vinces of his dominions.3 As to the traces of the Norwegian or Scandinavian race in the body of the Scottish people, they were, although perceptible, very partial and evanescent. Their settlements upon the mainland in Caithness and Ross were destroyed, and the Western Isles wrested from them by Alexander ; so that, were it not for the impression which they 1 Turgot, Vita Margaret\u00e6 Regin\u00e6.

In the period of a hundred and twenty years, be tween the accession of Alexander the Third and the death of David the Second, the Norman and Saxon population became so intimately blended together, as to appear one and the same people ; and their supe rior power and civilisation had gradually gained, from their rude and fierce competitors, the Gaels, the greater and the fairer portion of Scotland. Even in those northern provinces, which had long exclu sively belonged to them, barons of Norman and Saxon extraction were settled in possession of immense estates ; and the government of the constitution, which, there is little doubt, had been under Malcolm Canmore essentially Celtic, was now as decidedly feudal, including certain orders and ranks in society which were clearly and strongly marked. The king, under the feudal form of government, appears to have been superior to the highest nobility, in three great characters. He was the leader of the army in war, and possessed of the supreme military command ;l he was the great judge or administrator of justice to his people, either in person or by de puty ; and the fountain of honour, from whose will and authority all distinction and pre-eminence was 1 Simeon Dunelm. pp. 200, 210."], [268, "232 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. considered as primarily derived. It would be a great mistake, however, to suppose that his power was any thing approaching to despotic ; for it was controlled by that of the higher nobles, whose estates and vas sallage enabled them almost singly to compete with the sovereign. At the same time, there is decided proof that ample provision was made for the due maintenance of the royal state and dignity, both in the person of the king himself and his eldest son, whom, at a very early period, we find was consider ed as entitled to the crown by hereditary right.1 Edgar in 1106, being then on his death-bed, bestow ed upon his younger brother David, afterwards David the First, a large portion of his dominions, which in cluded the ancient kingdom of Strathclyd, and nearly the whole of the country to the south of the firths, with the exception of the Earldom of Dunbar y a proof that the personal estate of the Scottish king was at that time very great.

David, before he was king, erected Glasgow into a bishoprick, from which arises a strong presumption that it lay within his princi pality; and we find, that on his newly- erected Abbey of Selkirk, afterwards Kelso, he bestowed the tithes of his can of cheeses from Galloway, from which it is evident that he was the feudal superior of that district.

It is well known that this monarch paid to Richard the First the sum of ten thousand merks, for resigning the homage extorted by Henry the Second.0 Upon another occasion, he gave Richard two thousand merks to make up the heavy ransom which was exacted from the English monarch by the emperor.4 Upon John, King of Eng- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. 296.

Upon the marriage of Alexander the Second with the daughter of Lord Ingelram de Coucy, the portion of the youthful bride amounted to seven thousand merks, which was given her as a third of the royal revenue, so that in 1239, the date of this marriage, the annual revenue of the King of Scotland, proceed ing from the crown lands and other sources, amounted to twenty-one thousand merks,3 somewhat more than two hundred thousand pounds. The same monarch, notwithstanding the drain of the royal treasury, in his father's time, gave ten thousand merks, besides lands, as a marriage portion with his second sister ; and, on one memorable occasion, when the Scottish sovereign paid a Christmas visit to Henry the Third at York, in the mutual interchange of gifts between the two kings, Alexander, for the purpose of fitting out his royal host for the continent, made him a 1 F\u0153dera, vol. i. p. 155. 2 Hoveden, sol. 420. 3 Math.

We have seen that monarch obtain the kingdom of Man and the Western Isles by purchase from the King of Norway, paying down for them the sum of four thousand merks with an annual payment of a hundred merks for ever ; and, not long after this transaction, the same monarch, at the marriage of his daughter to Eric, king of Norway, assigned as her dower the sum of seven thousand merks, together with lands worth seven hundred merks a year.2 To give an exact ac count of the various sources of the royal revenue in those early times, would require a careful and length ened investigation. The rents and produce of the royal lands and manors throughout the country, the dues payable under the name of can on the products of agriculture, hunting, and fishing, the customs on the exports of wool, wool-fels, and hides, on articles of do mestic manufacture, on foreign trade and shipping, the fees and fines which arose at this period in all coun tries where the feudal system was established, from 1 Chron. de Dunstaple, MS.

The various officers of the royal household were the same ; and when encircled by these dignitaries, and surrounded by his prelates, barons, and vassals, the Scottish court, previous to the long war of liberty, and the disastrous reign of David the Second, was rich in feudal pomp and mag nificence. This is proved, by what has already been observed as to the condition of the royal revenue, when compared with the inferior command of money which we find at the same era in England f and some interesting and striking circumstances, which are incidentally mentioned by our ancient historians, confirm this opinion. As early as the age of Malcolm Canmore, an unusual splendour was introduced into the Scottish court by his Saxon queen. This prin- 1 Chalmers' Caledonia, vol. i. p. 747.

In her own dress, she was unusually magnificent ; whilst she increased the parade of the public appearance of the sovereign by augmenting the number of his personal attendants, and employing vessels of gold and silver in the ser vice of his table.1 Under the reign of Alexander the First, the intercourse of Scotland with the East, and the splendid appearance of the sovereign, are shown by a singular ceremony which took place in the High Church at St Andrews. This monarch, anxious to evince his devotion to the blessed apostle, not only endowed that religious house with numerous lands, and conferred upon it various and important immu nities, but, as an additional evidence of his piety, he commanded his favourite Arabian horse to be led up to the high altar, whose saddle and bridle were splen didly ornamented, and his housings of a rich cloth of velvet. A squire at the same time brought the king's body armour, which were of Turkish manufacture, and studded with jewels, with his spear and his shield of silver, and these, along with the noble horse and his furniture, the king, in the presence of his prelates and barons, solemnly devoted and presented to the church. The housings and arms were shown in the days of the historian who has recorded the event.2 1 Turgot, Vita Sanct.

On another occasion, the splendour of the Scottish court, and we must add, the foolish vanity of the Scottish monarch and his nobles, were evinced in a very remarkable manner. Alexander the Third, and a party of a hundred knights, were present at the coronation of Edward the First ; and in the midst of the festival, when the king sat at table, and the wells and fountains were running the choicest wines, he and his attendants dismounted, and turned their horses, with their splendid housings, loose amongst the populace, to become the property of the first per son who caught them, \u2014 -a piece of magnificent extra vagance ; which was imitated by Prince Edmund, the king's brother, and others of the English nobles.1 From these facts some idea may be formed of the wealth of the royal court of Scotland. Like the other contemporary feudal monarchs of Europe, the sovereign was surrounded by certain great ministers of state, under the names of the justiciar, the chan cellor, the constable, the marshal, the seneschal, the chamberlain, and the hostiarius or doorward. These offices were held by the richest and most powerful nobles, whose wealth enabled them to keep up a train of vassals, which almost rivalled the circle round the sovereign ; and who, in their own court and cas tle, mimicked the royal pomp, and were surrounded by their own cupbearers, constables, seneschals, and chamberlains.2 Next to the king, therefore, such great officers held the highest rank in the nation ; and 1 Knighton, Col. 2461. 2 Robertson's Index, p. 82."], [275, "OFFICERS OF THE CROWN. 239 no correct picture of the feudal government of Scot land, during this early period, can be given, without briefly considering the respective duties which de volved upon them. In the history of our legal administration, during that long period which occupies the interval between the accession of the First Alexander and the First James, the office of great justiciar holds a conspicu ous place ; although, from the very few authentic records of those times, it is difficult to speak with precision as to its peculiar province. It has already been remarked, that, in this early age, the king was the fountain of justice, and the su preme judge of his people. We are indebted to a contemporary historian for a fine picture of David the First in this great character. \" It was his custom,\" says Ethelred, \" to sit, on certain days, at the gate of his palace, and to listen in person to the complaints of the poorest suitors who chose to bring their cause before him. In this employment he spared no la bour to satisfy those who appealed to him of the jus tice of his decision ; encouraging them to enter into argument, whilst he kindly replied, and endeavoured to convince them of the justice of his reasons. \u2014 Yet,\" adds the historian, with great simplicity, \" they often showed an unwillingness to acquiesce in his mode of argument.\"1 The progresses which were annually made by the king, for the purpose of redressing grievances, and 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 940."], [276, "240 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. inquiring into the conduct of his officers throughout the realm, have been already noticed under the reign of Alexander the Third ; but the general administra tion of justice, at a very early period, seems to have been intrusted to two great judges, \u2014 the one embra cing, within his jurisdiction, the northern, and the other the southern part of the kingdom. Under these supreme officers, a variety of inferior judges appear to have enjoyed a delegated and subordinate jurisdic tion, who borrowed their designations from the dis trict in which they officiated, and were denominated the Judge of Gowry, the Judge of Buchan, the Judge of Strathern, the Judge of Perth ; but of whose exact authority and jurisdiction no authentic record re mains.1 The existence, both of the supreme and of the inferior judges, can be traced in authentic muni ments, preserved chiefly in the Cartularies, throughout the reigns of Alexander the First, David the First, and Malcolm the Fourth, during a period of nearly sixty years, from 1106 to 1165. William the Lion, who assumed the crown immediately after Malcolm IV., appears to have changed or new-modelled these offices, by the creation of two great judges named Justiciars ; the one the Justiciarius Laodoni\u00e6, whose authority extended over the whole of the country south of the two Firths ; and the other the Justici arius Scoti\u00e6, embracing within his jurisdiction the whole of Scotland beyond the Forth.

At the period of the temporary subjugation of Scot- land by Edward the First, this monarch, in his new- modelling of the machine of government, introduced a change by appointing two justices in Lothian, two others in the country lying between the Forth and the eastern end of the Grampian range, called the Mounth, and, lastly, by separating the great northern district, extending from the Grampians to Caithness, 1 Dalyel's Desultory Reflections on the Ancient State of Scot land, p. 43.

Scotland, however, soon recovered her independence ; and it seems probable, that the ancient institution of a single justiciar of Lothian was restored, along with her other native dignities, by Robert Bruce. It is certain, at least, that the existence of a single judge under that title can be traced through authen tic documents down to the period of James the Fifth. The latter institution of Edwrard, regarding the four justiciaries of Scotland, who presided over the regions to the north of the Forth, as it was sanctioned by an cient usage, was preserved by him who was the re storer of ancient right.2 It would thus appear that, during the reign of Robert Bruce, the civil and cri minal jurisdiction of the country was, with the ex ceptions to be immediately noticed, divided between five different justiciars ; and it is probable, although it cannot be stated with historical certainty, that these supreme judges acted by deputies, who officia ted in their absence, or presided in minor cases ; and that they continued to be the supreme judges in Scotland down to the time of James the Fifth.

The office of chancellor, next in dignity to that of the justiciar, is certainly as ancient as the reign of Alexander the First ; but the precise nature of the authority committed to this great officer at this re mote era of our history, cannot be easily ascertained ; and where authentic records do not demonstrate its limits, speculation is idle and unsatisfactory. It ex isted at a very early period in France, under the reign of Charlemagne ; it is found in England in the Saxon times ; but it was not till a much later period in Scotland, when the traces of a Celtic government became faint and almost imperceptible, and the Go thic race of the Saxons and the Scoto-Normans drove back the Celtic people into the remoter regions of the country, that Herbert the Chancellor appears amongst the officers of the crown.1 From this pe riod, down to the coronation of Bruce, the industry of Chalmers has given a series of these great officers ; and without entering into any antiquarian or etymo logical discussion, we have an authentic muniment in the contract of marriage between the son of Edward the First and the Maiden of Norway, by which it appears, that the custody of the king's seal, the exa mination of all writs which received the royal signa- 1 Crawford's Officers of State, p. 4."], [280, "244 HISTORY' OF SCOTLAND. ture, and the cancelling or refusing the royal sanction to such deeds as appeared irregular, were then the chief duties of this high officer. In addition to this, the chancellor was the most intimate councillor of the king ; he was always lodged near the royal person, he attended the sovereign wherever he went, both in peace and war, and was witness to his most solemn charters, letters, and proclamations.1 This great office continued, as is well known, down to the period of the union of the kingdoms ; an existence, if we com pute from its appearance under Alexander the First, of nearly six centuries. It has been already observed, that the supremacy of the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the great justiciars was limited by some exceptions ; and the first of these is to be found in the existence of the ancient office of sheriff, the earliest appearance of which is to be found in the beginning of the twelfth century, under the reign of Alexander the First.2 This, however, is the very dawn of the institution, and the division of Scotland into regular and certain sheriffdoms must be referred to a much later era. It seems to be a sound opinion of the author of Ca ledonia, that \" sheriffdoms were gradually laid out, as the Scoto-Saxon people gained upon the Gaelic inhabitants, and as the modern law, introduced by the Saxons, prevailed over the ruder institutions of 1 Rymer's Foedera, vol. ii. p. 483.

Many of these offices, the appointment to which was originally in the crown, had, at this early period, become hereditary in certain families ; and, in imitation of the regal state, every greater baron appears to have appointed his sheriff,2 iii the same manner as we find many of these petty feudal and ecclesiastical princes, surrounded by their chamber lains, chancellors, marshals, and seneschals. It is certain, from the evidence of authentic records, that the term schire was anciently given to districts of much smaller extent than the sheriffships of the pre sent day. In the foundation charter of William the Lion to the abbey of Aberbrothock, we find the shires of Aberbrothoc, of Denechyn, of Kingoldrum, and of Athyn ; and in the Cartulary of the abbey of Dun fermline, Dumfermeline schire, Dolorshire, Newburn shire, Musselburghshire, with the shires of Gelland and Gaitmilk. Over these minute divisions we do not discover any presiding judge enjoying the title of sheriff. Previous, however, to the memorable year 1296, these smaller divisions had disappeared; and the different enactments of Edward the First, 1 Caledonia, p. 715. 2 Cart, of Glasgow, 163, 5, quoted in Caledonia, p. 716.

Under that savage state of feudal liberty, which lasted for many centuries in Scotland, all the higher nobles, both civil and ecclesiastical, enjoyed the power of holding their own court, and deciding causes where the parties were their vassals. The origin of this is curious. At a very early period, probably about the middle of the twelfth century, in the reign of Mal colm the Fourth, the land of Scotland began to be partially divided into royalty and regality. Those parts which were distinguished by the term royalty, were subjected to the jurisdiction of the king and his judges ; the districts, on the other hand, which were comprehended under the name of regalities, acknowledged the jurisdiction of those ecclesiastics or nobles, who had received a grant of lands from the crown, with the rights of regality annexed to it. The clergy appear to have been the first, who, in the charters of lands which they often procured from the crown, prevailed upon the sovereign to convey to them the right of holding their own courts, and to 1 Robertson's Index to the Charters. Notes to the Introduction, p. xl."], [283, "POWER OF THE FEUDAL BARONS. 247 grant them an immunity from the jurisdiction of all superior judges. As early as the reign of Alexander the First, a royal charter conferred upon the monks of the abbey of Scone the right of holding their own court in the fullest manner, and of giving judgment either by combat, by iron, or by water ; together with all privileges pertaining to their court ; inclu ding the right in all persons resident within their territory, of refusing to answer except in their own proper court ;l which right of exclusive jurisdiction was confirmed by four successive monarchs. The same grants were enjoyed, as we know from authen tic documents, by the Bishop of St Andrews, and the Abbots of Holyrood, Dunfermline, Kelso, and Aber brothoc, and we may presume, on strong grounds, by every religious house in the kingdom. These powers of jurisdiction excluded the authority or in terference of every other judge, of which we have decided proof in the Cartulary of Aberbrothoc.2 It appears, that in the year 1299, the abbot of that house repledged from the court of the king's justiciar, which was held at Aberdeen, one of his own men, upon pleading the privilege of the regality of Aber brothoc; and in imitation of the clergy, the higher barons soon procured from the royal fear or munifi cence, the same judicial rights and exemptions, which they in their turn conveyed to their vassals. A su perior baron in those ancient times was thus in every respect a king in miniature. Surrounded by the of- 1 Cartulary of Scone, p. 17. 2 Cartulary of Aberbrotboc, p. 19,"], [284, "248 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ficers of his little feudal court, he possessed the high privilege of dispensing justice, or what he chose to term justice, amongst his numerous vassals ; he was the supreme criminal judge within his far-extended territories, and enjoyed the power of life and death, of imprisonment within his own dungeon, and of re claiming from the court, even of the high justiciar, any subject or vassal who lived upon his lands. Can we wonder that, in the course of years, men, possessed of such high and independent privileges, became too powerful for the crown itself ? It was in consequence of this, that Bruce, in the disposition of many im mense estates, which were forfeited for their deter mined opposition to his claim to the crown, bestowed them in smaller divisions upon new proprietors, who rose upon the ruins of these ancient houses.1 The frequent grants of these estates by Bruce, diminished the strength of the ancient aristocracy ; but it is evi dent, at the same time, that, as the new charters fre quently conveyed along with the lands the rights of holding their own court, the power which had con trolled the crown during the struggle of this great prince for his kingdom, was rather divided than di- minished ; so that the new barons, under the weak reign and long captivity of his successor, became as independent and tyrannical as before.

In this brief sketch of our civil history it is impos sible to enter upon the great and important subject of the law of the kingdom, as it existed during this remote period ; but it may be generally remarked, that in the courts of the great justiciaries, as well as in those held by the inferior officers of justice through out the realm, most causes of importance appear to have been determined by the opinion of an assize, or an inquest ; a mode of legal decision which we can discern as early as the reign of William the Lion. In the year 1124, we find an inquest appointed to decide a dispute regarding the pasturage of the King's Fo rest, which had arisen between the monks of Melrose and the men of Wedale. The inquest, which con sisted of twelve \" Good Men,\" fideles Iwmines, and Richard Moreville the constable, were sworn on the relics of the church, and sat in presence of the king, his brother, David Earl of Huntingdon, with the pre lates and nobles of the court. It is probable, although it cannot be affirmed with historical certainty, that even at this early age, the opinion of the majority of this jury of thirteen decided the case, and that una nimity was not required.1 In an inferior dispute, which seems to have arisen between the monastery of Soltre and the inhabitants of the manor of Crailing, in the year 1271, regarding the right of the monks to a sheaf of corn every har- 1 Chron.

This great officer was the leader of the military power of the kingdom. In England, we find him, in 1163, denominated indiscriminately constabularius andprin ceps militi\u00e6 ;2 and there is every reason to believe that the province of the constable, as head of the army, was the same in both countries. What was the exact distinction in our own country between the office of the marechal and the constable, it is not very easy to deter mine. That they were different, appears certain from the fact, that we find a marechal and a constable under the same monarch, and held by different persons ; but we have no authentic record which describes the na ture of the duties which devolved upon the marechal, although there is no doubt that both offices, at a very early period, became hereditary in certain great fami lies.3 The offices of the seneschal, or high steward, and of the chamberlain, belonged to the personal estate of the sovereign, and those who held them en joyed the supreme authority in the management of 1 Cartul. of Soltre, No. 17. 2 Math.

Both are as ancient as the reign of David the First ; and the rolls of the royal expendi ture, and receipts of the various items and articles of revenue, which were kept by the chamberlain, in his capacity of treasurer, still fortunately remain to us a most curious and instructive monument of the state of the times. The offices of inferior interest, though of equal antiquity \u2014 the panetarius, or royal butler ; the hostiarius, or keeper of the king's door ; the pincerna, or cup-bearer ; to which we may add, the keepers of the king's hounds, the royal falconers, the keeper of the wardrobe, the clerk of the kitchen, and various other inferior dignitaries \u2014 sufficiently explain themselves, and indicate a high degree of personal state and splen dour. Wherever the king moved his court, he was commonly attended by the great officers of the crown, who were generally the richest and most powerful nobles of the realm. It will be recollected, also, that such high barons were, in their turn, encircled by their own seneschals, chamberlains, constables, and personal attendants, and brought in their train a brilliant assemblage of knights, squires, and inferior barons, who regarded their feudal lord as a master to whom they owed a more sacred and paramount al legiance, than even to their king.

This has been sometimes called the prin ciple of honour ; but as their neglect was sure to be visited with punishment, if not with utter ruin and degradation, it was, in truth, a lower principle \u2014 of selfishness and necessity, which limited their duties to the single business of supporting their liege lord against those whom he chose to esteem his enemies. None indeed can attentively read the history of those dark times, without being aware that the immense body of the feudal vassals, and military retainers, throughout Scotland, regarded the desertion of their king, or their leaguing themselves against the liberty of their country, as a crime of infinitely lighter dye, than a single act of disobedience to the commands of their liege lord ; and considered in this light, we must view the feudal system, notwithstanding all the noble and romantic associations with which it has invested itself, as having been undoubtedly, in our own country, a principal obstruction to the progress of liberty and improvement. We shall conclude our remarks upon the distinction of ranks in Scotland, by some observations upon the state of the lower classes of the people during this important period of our history. These classes seem to have been divided into two distinct orders. There were, first, the free farmers, or tenants of the crown, of the church, and of the greater or lesser barons, who held their lands under lease for a certain rent, were possessed of considerable wealth, and enjoyed the full power of settlement in any part"], [289, "STATE OF THE LOWER ORDERS. 253 of the country which they chose to select, or under any landlord whom they preferred. This class is ge nerally known in the books of the Chamberlain's Ac counts by the title of \" liberi firmarii ;\" and a convin cing proof of their personal freedom at a very early period is to be found in the fact, which we learn from these most curious and instructive records, that the farmers of the king possessed the full power of remo ving from the property of the crown to a more eli gible situation. During the minority of the Maiden of Norway, a sum of money was advanced to the far mers of the king, in order to prevail upon them to remain on the crown lands of Liberton and Laurence town, which they were about to desert, on account of a mortality amongst their cattle.1 It was, I conjec ture, this free body of feudal tenants who were lia ble to be called out on military service, and formed the great proportion of the Scottish infantry, or spear men, in the composition of the army. Very different from the condition of this first order was the second class of cottars, bondsmen, or vil leyns. Their condition forms a marked and extra ordinary feature in the history of the times. They were slaves who were sold with the land ; and their master and purchaser possessed over their persons the same right of property which he exercised over 1 \" Item firmariis regis terre de Liberton et Laurancyston quo rum animalia anno predicto moriebantur ad valorem x librarum iii. c. de gracia ad presens, et ne exeant terram regis in paupertate, et ne terra regis jaceat inculta.\" Chamberlain's Accounts, Temp. Custodum Regni, p. 65."], [290, "254 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the cattle upon his estate. They could not remove without his permission ; wherever they settled, his right of property attached to them ; and, whenever he pleased, he could reclaim them, with their whole chattels and effects, as effectually as he could seize on any animal which had strayed from his domain. Of this state of slavery innumerable examples are to be found in the cartularies, establishing, beyond the possibility of controversy, that a considerable portion of the labouring classes of the community was in a state of absolute servitude. We find, for example, in the Cartulary of Dunferm line, that a bondsman, of the name Allan, the son of Constantine, with his two sons, had in 1 340 transfer red themselves from the lands of the abbot of this re ligious house to some other habitation, under pretence that they were the bondsmen of Duncan Earl of Fife. On being ordered to come back to their own master, they had refused ; upon which an inquest was sum moned, for the purpose of determining to whom Al lan, the son of Constantine, and his sons, belonged ; when it was found that they were the property of the abbot.1 So early as the year 1178, William the Lion made a donation of Gillandrean M'Suthen and his children to the monks of Dunfermline for ever.2 We find that David the First, in 1144, granted, to the Abbot 1 Cartulary of Dunfermline, p. 654.

When a grant of land was made by the king, or by any of his nobility, either for military service, or to be held blench for the payment of a nominal feu duty, it carried along with it, to the vassal, the pow er of removing the tenants, with their cattle, provi ded they be not native bondsmen. The right to these, and the power of reclaiming them, remained in the person of the lord of the soil, or feudal superior. Thus, in a valuable collection of ancient papers, we find a charter, by which one of the Roberts confers 1 MS. Monasticon Scoti\u00e6, p. 33; quoted in Chalmers's Caledo nia, vol. i. p. 720, and MS.

Accordingly, the cartularies present us with frequent examples of genealogies of this sort.2 The names of these bondsmen are essentially different from the free-born vassals and tenants, who com monly took their names from their lands. In an an cient deed, entitled a perambulation to determine the boundaries between the lands of the Abbot of Dun fermline and those of David Doorward, which took place in the year 1231, under Alexander the Second, the names of the landholders and minor barons, and of the bondsmen who attended upon this occasion, are easily distinguishable from each other. We meet with Constantine de Lochor, and Philip de Loch, and many others, after which occur such uncouth appel latives as the following \u2014 Gillecostentin, Bredinlamb, Gilleserfmae Rolf, Gillecolmmacmelg, John Trodi, Riscoloc, Beth MacLood, Gillepatric Macmanethin ; 1 Haddington's Collections, quoted by Dalyel, Fragments, p. 27. 2 Cartul. of Dunferm. pp. 145, 146. See Appendix, letter O. ll"], [293, "STATE OF THE LOWER ORDERS. 257 and it may be noticed as a singular circumstance, which proves how different were the habits and cus toms of this degraded class from the freemen of the same country, that the father does not seem to have transmitted his name or sirname to his children, or, at least, that this did not necessarily happen. In the genealogy of John Scoloc, which is preserved in the Cartulary of Dunfermline, the son of Patrick Stur sarauch was Allan Gilgrewer, and the son of Allan Gilgrewer was John Scoloc.1 It seems certain that no change in the situation of these bondsmen, by which they rose in eminence or opulence, could have the effect of removing them from their original de graded condition. They might enter the church and become clerks, or continue laymen, and pursue a suc cessful career as artizans or merchants, but they were still as much slaves as before ; and, till the time they purchased or procured their liberty by the grant of their master, their persons, profits, and whole estate, belonged exclusively to him. This is strikingly ex emplified in a convention preserved in the Cartulary of Moray, which took place between Andrew, the bishop of that see, and Walter Comyn. It was agreed, in this deed, that the Bishop of Moray, and his successors in the see, should have all the clerks, and two laymen, whose names were Gillemalovock Mack nakengelle, and Sythac Macmallon ; these clerical and lay bondsmen, the deed proceeds to say, are to 1 Cartulary of Dunfermline, p. 115.

K"], [294, "258 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. belong to the bishop and his successors, with their cattle, possessions, and children for ever ; while the Lord Walter Comyn is to have all the remaining lay bondsmen of the lands of Logykenny and Inverdrum myn.1 It may, perhaps, be doubted whether the clerici nativi here spoken of, do actually mean bonds men who have become clerks, or may perhaps merely signify bondsmen belonging to church lands. Yet the words of the deed, and the marked opposition in which we find the words clerici et laid nativi, seem to fa vour the meaning here attached to it. In England, under the government of the con queror, it was the mark of freemen, that they could travel where they chose ; and exactly the same cri terion was established in our own country. In Domesday Book, a Norman baron, Hugo de Port, is mentioned as the master of two tenants, who, in the days of Edward the Confessor, might go where they pleased without leave. In like manner Robert Bruce, in the year 1320, grants a charter to Ade, the son of Aldan, in which he declares that it had been found, by an inquest held before his chamberlain and jus ticiary, that this person was not the king's slave or bondsman, but was at liberty to remove himself and his children, with their goods and chattels, to any part of the kingdom which he might select, at his own will and pleasure, without molestation by any one. On which account the king declares the said Ade, with his sons Beth, John, Ranald, and Duncan, 1 Cartulary of Moray, pp. 53, 54. Appendix, O. Caledonia, p. 721."], [295, "259 STATE OF THE LOWER ORDERS. to be his freemen, and as such not subject to any yoke or burden of servitude for ever.1 As the mas ter could reclaim his fugitive bondsman from any place to which he had transferred himself, so it was in his power alone to make his slave a freeman whenever he pleased. Thus, by a charter, dated at Perth on the 28th February, 1369, David the Se cond intimates to all concerned, that he has made William, the son of John, the bearer of these letters, who was his slave and bondsman, his freeman, and had emancipated all his posterity, so that he had full right, without trouble or molestation, to travel with his property and his children to whatever place he chose, and there take up his abode.2 Many exam ples of the manumission of such unfortunate persons by their baronial masters, and still more frequent in stances of the gift of freedom, conferred by the rich ecclesiastics and religious houses, are to be found in records of undoubted authenticity.3 But the pro gress of freedom amongst the labourers of the soil was exceedingly slow and gradual ; the names which are indicative of this degraded condition, such as na- 1 Henshall's Specimens, p. 74.

In Scotland, bondage appears to have been sooner abolished than in the sister country. It continued in force in England as late as the year 1536 ; and its last traces are still discoverable in 1574, when a com mission was issued by Elizabeth for the complete ma numission of the last relics of bondsmen and bonds women in her dominions.1 1 Barrington on the Statutes, pp. 247, 351."], [297, "261 SECTION III. ANCIENT PARLIAMENT OF SCOTLAND. In the course of these observations, a subject of high interest and importance now presents itself, the satisfactory elucidation of which would require many pages of careful and laborious investigation ; I mean the history and constitution of the Ancient Parlia ment of Scotland. Long before the existence of the word parliament, or the mention of the three Estates of the kingdom, in our authentic histories or records, the sovereign of Scotland, like every other contemporary feudal mo narch, was accustomed to consult, on occasions of so lemnity and importance, with his high national coun cil ; consisting of the bishops and abbots, the great officers of the crown, and the most powerful nobles and barons of the realm ; but nothing resembling a regular parliament is to be found during the reigns of Alexander the First, or of his brother David. The bold and imperious character of Alexander seems, in deed, to have stretched the royal prerogative to the utmost extent ; and, from the few and imperfect re cords of his short reign which yet remain to us, he appears to have been his own chief-councillor ; but it is more remarkable, that we look in vain for a par liament, or for any solemn assembly of the Estates of the realm, under the long reign of David the First,"], [298, "262 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. although he has been pronounced by Buchanan, an impartial witness when kings are the subject, the most perfect model of a wise and virtuous prince. Yet David was undoubtedly a legislator ; and on one memorable occasion, the death of the heir-apparent, his only son, Prince Henry, he adopted the most so lemn measures for the regulation of the succession. It will, perhaps, be recollected by the reader, that, under the reign of Robert Bruce, when the death of the young Steward rendered necessary some new enactments regarding the succession to the throne, a parliament assembled, in which the entail of the crown was solemnly settled upon Robert the Second, and his descendants. Now, David the First, in 1152, had exactly the same task to perform as Bruce in 1318. But the mode in which it was executed was en tirely different. He called no parliament. We do not even discover that he took the advice of his royal council, or of his nobility. But he assembled an army, of which he gave the command to one of the most powerful of his nobles, and, delivering to him his infant grandson, commanded him to march through his dominions, and to proclaim him heir to the crown ;l a circumstance from which there arises a strong pre sumption that, at this period, a parliament was un known in Scotland. Neither do we find this great council under the reign of his successor, Malcolm the Fourth. Hailes, indeed, in his Annals, informs us that Malcolm, with the advice of his parliament, gave his sisters, Ada and 1 Simeon Dunehn. p. 280."], [299, "263 ANCIENT PARLIAMENT OF SCOTLAND. Margaret, in marriage to the Counts of Holland and Brittany ; but the words of Fordun, if accurately un derstood, bear no such meaning. And the conjec ture which the same author has added, in a note, is the true meaning : \" Malcolmus subsidio suorum et consilio;\" implies nothing more than that Malcolm, with the \" assistance and advice of his nobles,\" mar ried his sisters : and the assistance here spoken of was probably an aid or grant of money, given to the king to make up the marriage portions of the young prin cesses ; but there is not the slightest proof that a par liament was assembled, during the reign of Malcolm, upon this, or upon any other occasion.1 In 1174, William the Lion, the successor of Mal colm the Fourth, having been taken prisoner by the English, after a short confinement at Richmond, was sent, by Henry the Second, to a more secure and dis tant dungeon at Falaise, in Normandy. The event called for an immediate interference of those upon whom the principal management of the government devolved ; and it is too well known that, in the name of the nation, a disgraceful transaction took place, by which the king, with consent of the Scottish barons and clergy, purchased his liberty at the price of the independence of the country. The principal for tresses of the kingdom, and the most noble barons of the realm, were placed in the hands of the English king, as hostages for the performance of this treaty ; yet this whole transaction, which gave liberty to a king, and extorted from the nobles an acknowledg- ' Fordun a Goodal, b. viii. c. 4.

Upon the accession of Richard the First, that cru sading monarch, anxious to collect money for his ex peditions to the Holy Land, proposed to restore, to the same prince who had resigned it, the independ ence of the nation, upon payment of ten thousand merks, somewhat more than a hundred thousand pounds of our present money. This sum, we learn, from authentic evidence in the Cartulary of Scone,1 was collected by means of an aid granted by the cler gy and the nobles ; and it is remarkable, that there is not the slightest mention of a parliament in the course of the whole transaction. Not long before his death, the same monarch concluded a peace with King John of England ; by one of the articles of which he enga ged to pay to this prince the large sum of fifteen thousand merks. This could not be done without as sistance ; and, when the term of settlement arrived, \" a great council,\" says Fordun, \" was held at Stirling, in which having requested an aid from his nobility, they promised to contribute ten thousand merks, besides the burgesses of the kingdom, who agreed to give him six thousand.\"2 That this was a national council, and not merely a consultation of the king with his great officers, is, I think, evident, from an expression of Benedictus Abbas, when describing the considera tion given by William to a proposal of Henry the Second, for a marriage between the Scottish prince 1 Cartulary of Scone, f. 10.

We shall, I think, be completely confirmed iu this opinion, by an examination of some of the great public transactions of the succeeding reign of Alex ander the Second. Upon the marriage of this mo narch with an English princess, Joan, the sister of Henry the Third, it naturally happened that many intricate discussions and grave and material stipula tions took place ; yet these, as well as the settlement of the jointure of the princess, were discussed, and finally concluded, without the intervention of a parliament. And the same observation may be made on the se cond marriage of this prince with Mary de Couci.3 On another occasion, when Alexander, in 1224, levied an aid of ten thousand pounds, for providing portions to his sisters, it was certainly granted, or rather im posed upon the nation, by the simple order of the 1 Benedictus Abbas, p. 448. *- Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 529. 3 Math.

On the contrary, although he was one of the wisest and most popular of our early kings, although statutes of his enactment have come down to us, and his reign is fertile in domestic troubles and in foreign war, a careful examination of our authentic historical records has failed to discover a single in stance, if we except the above, in which a parliament was assembled ; and the government appears to have been entirely directed and controlled by the will of the king, and the advice and assistance of the great officers of the crown. Upon the accession of Alexander the Third there was evidently no change in this respect. The important public measure of the marriage of their youthful king with a daughter of Henry the Third, the appointment of counsellors, who were in trusted with the management of the kingdom during the minority of the sovereign, and the frequent changes in the regency which occurred in the stormy commencement of this reign, were wholly carried through without a parliament.3 But we shall not 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 53. 2 Ibid. vol. ii. p. 34. 3 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 84, 85, 90, 91.

The words, \" habito super hoc maturo avisamento,\" which are used by Fordun, cannot, by the utmost ingenuity, be construed into any thing more than a consultation between the king and his council.1 The mode of considering the expediency of any public measure during this reign, appears to have been by the king holding a council, or colloquy, with the officers of the crown, and, probably, the most powerful of the nobility. In the year 1264, when the treaty with Norway was in agitation, Alexander held two colloquies of this kind at Edinburgh ; and the accounts of the chamberlain inform us, that, on this occasion, the carcasses of twenty-seven cows, six calves, and fourscore of sheep, were sent to the capi tal for the consumption of the king's household.2 On the death of the prince of Scotland, and of his commissioner from Henry the Third to the King of Scotland, on his arrival in that country, found the king and queen, and the nobility of tbe realm, assembled in parliament ; but of this parliament we have no evidence in Fordun, or Winton, or any authentic record. It was in all probability a mere assembly of the court. 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 102. 2 In vigenti septem Carcosiis vaccarum et vi. vacc. et iiij*** mul tonibus einpt. ad Servicium Dni Regis ad duo Colloquia que tene banturapud Edinburgh, anno mcclxiv.

Winton informs us, that Alexander the Third \" caused make a great gathering of the States at Scone ;\" and, by an original and contemporary record in Rymer, it is shown that in this \" gathering,\" which took place on the 5th February, 1283-4, the Scottish nobles bound themselves bya solemn oath to acknowledge Margaret, princess of Norway, as their lawful queen, failing any children of the monarch then on the throne, or of the prince of Scotland deceased.1 The expressions used by Fordun in describing the same assembly, denominate it a council of the prelates and nobles of the realm.2 Neither of these historians makes use of the word parliament in recording this event, nor is there the slightest evidence of the appearance of the represent atives of the burghs upon this solemn occasion ; and, as Alexander the Third died soon after, we must conclude that, during his whole reign, there is no evidence that a parliament, in the sense in which that word was used in England under Edward the First, ever sat in Scotland. Upon the death of this rao- 1 Winton, vol. i. p. 397, and Rymer, vol. ii, p. 1091, and 582.

But this, as may be naturally conjectured, was not a sudden, but agra dual change, of which the history is both interest ing and important. Immediately after the death of Alexander the Third, we are informed by Winton that there was a meeting of the Estates of Scotland, who held a parliament, in which they appointed six regents to govern the kingdom. It is remarkable that this is the first time that the word parliament is used by this historian ; but unfortunately no authen tic record of its proceedings has been preserved ; and Fordun is even silent as to its existence.1 With re gard, however, to a meeting of the Estates of Scot land, which, not long after this, took place at Brig ham, we are fortunately not so much in the dark, as the record of it is preserved, and proves beyond a doubt the exact constitution of the great national council or parliament in 1289- It consisted of the five guardians or regents, ten bishops, twelve earls, twenty-three abbots, eleven priors, and forty-eight barons, who address themselves to Edward under the title of the Community of Scotland ; and it is certain 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 10. Fordun a Hearne, p. 951."], [306, "270 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. that, in this parliament held at Brigham, there is not the slightest appearance of the representatives of the burghs ; an evident proof that, although called upon frequently to contribute their portion in the aids or grants of money which the exigencies of the king dom required, they as yet had no place in the nation al council, and were not considered, in a legislative light, as part of the community of the realm. In the solemn treaty regarding the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Maiden of Norway, which was concluded at Brigham, one of the articles ex pressly stipulates, \" that no parliament was ever to be held without the boundaries of Scotland ;\" but the deed itself throws no light upon the composition of this national council. The death of the princess of Scotland, and the bold and unprincipled conduct of the English monarch, have been already detailed ; and as the various conferences preparatory to the decision of the great question of the succession took place in an English parliament, although attended by the whole body of the Scottish nobility, it would be im proper to draw any material inferences from this part of our history illustrative of the constitution of the ancient Scottish parliament. Fordun,1 indeed, has informed us, that the parliament of Scotland af terwards declared to Baliol, that he had been com pelled to swear homage to Edward, \" inconsultis tri bus statibus regni.\" It is material, however, to ob serve, that when Edward, in the interval between the delivery of the Scottish fortresses, and the production 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 152."], [307, "271 ANCIENT PARLIAMENT OF SCOTLAND. of the claims of the competitors, took his progress through Scotland for the purpose of exacting a ge neral homage, he called upon the burgesses of the realm to come forward and take the oaths of alle giance ; and that the first record in which we find the names of this important class in the community is an English deed, and the first monarch who consi dered their consent as a matter of public consequence was an English sovereign.1 Upon the accession of Baliol to the throne, we have seen the premeditated harshness and intolerance with which he was soon treated by his new master ; and it is remarkable, that in the parliament which was held by this unfortunate monarch immediately after these indignities had been offered him, there is the first authentic intimation that the majores populi, or chiefs of the people, formed a constituent part of this assembly.2 This, therefore, is the first great na tional council in the history of our country, which is truly entitled to be called a parliament ; the first meeting of the Estates, in which the clergy, the no bility, and the representatives or heads of the people, sat in deliberation upon the affairs of the country. It may, perhaps, be in the recollection of the reader, that its proceedings were of a very bold and deter mined description. They banished all Englishmen from Scotland, seized and confiscated the estates of 1 F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 573. Prynne, pp. 502, 512. 2 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 153.

It contains a clause, which provides that it shall be corroborated by the seals and the sig natures, not only of the prelates and nobles, but of the \" communitates villarum regni Scoti\u00e6,\" meaning, evidently, the royal burghs of the kingdom.2 The expression in another part of the treaty is, \" Univer sitates et communitates notabiles regni,\" which s equally clear and definite. I venture, therefore, to affirm, that as far as an examination of the most au thentic records which have yet been discovered, en titles us to judge on the subject, the first appearance of the royal burghs as an integral part of the Scot tish parliament, is to be found under the third parlia ment of Baliol ; and that we probably owe their ad mission into the great national council to our bitter enemy, Edward the First. Could we discover the original record of this important parliament, the question would at once be set at rest ; but the ex- 1 Vol. i. pp. 106, 107, 108. 2 Rvmer's F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 696. 3"], [309, "ANCIENT PARLIAMENT OF SCOTLAND. 273 pression of Fordun, and the positive proof of the ap pearance of the burghs in the treaty with the King of France, appear to be conclusive upon the point. In the long train of national calamities which fol lowed this alliance with Philip, we do not once meet with any event which throws light upon the con stitution of our ancient parliament, till the period when Edward, after the death of Wallace and the surrender of the castle of Stirling, in the prema ture belief that his Scottish wars were ended, pro ceeded to organize a final settlement of his conquest. Upon this occasion, the persons whom he consult ed were, the Bishop of Glasgow, Robert Bruce, af terwards king, and John de Moubrai. By their advice, he issued an ordinance, directing that the \" Community of Scotland,\" meaning the states of the realm, should assemble at Perth on the 28th of May, 1305, in order to elect ten commissioners, who were to repair to the English parliament, which was to be held at London. This number of ten persons, who were vested with full powers from the Scottish parliament, was to include two bishops, two abbots, two earls, two barons, and two members to represent the \" Commune,\" or community of burghs ; a very clear and satisfactory proof, that their right to be re presented in the great national council was now dis tinctly recognised, and that they stood in this respect upon the same ground as the two other Estates of the kingdom.1 It is especially unfortunate that no au- 1 Palgrave's Parliamentary Writs, Introductory Chronological Abstract, p. 66.

S"], [310, "274 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. thentic record has come down to us, of the proceed ings of the Scottish parliament in which these ten commissioners were elected ; but it may be presumed that the representatives of the burghs sat in the na tional council at Perth, and elected the two commis sioners, who were to appear for them in the English parliament at London. From this period till the year immediately subsequent to the battle of Ban nockburn, no parliament sat in Scotland. Perhaps it is more correct to say, no record of any has been pre served, because an important council of the clergy, which was held at Dundee, and in which a solemn instrument was drawn up respecting the succession to the crown, gives us some ground for supposing that about the same time a meeting of the three Estates had taken place. In the year 1315, Bruce, whose only child was a daughter, yet unmarried, judging it prudent to settle the succession, assembled a parliament at Ayr, on the 26th April, 1315 ; and we know, from the authentic evidence of the instru ment drawn up at this time, that the heads of the communities, or burghs, sat in this parliament, and affixed their seals to the deed, along with the prelates, earls, and barons, who were convoked upon this so lemn occasion.1 No other meaning can be affixed to the passage which affirms that the prelates, earls, barons, 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 258.

The same observations may be made regarding the parliament which met at Scone in the year 1318, af ter the death of King Edward Bruce in Ireland ; in which it was deemed necessary, by King Robert, to introduce some new regulations regarding the same subject, \u2014 the succession to the crown.1 Of this as sembly of the Estates, as of the former, no original re cord remains ; but the presence of the \" communities\" or burghs is proved by the copy of the original deed, which is preserved amongst the Harleian Manu scripts. In like manner, strong evidence is afforded by the famous letter of remonstrance, which was addressed to the Pope in the year 1320, that the burghs were now considered as an integral part of the parliament. This epistle was drawn up in a parliament held at Aberbrothock ; and, after enumerating in its exor dium the names of the prelates, earls, and most noted of the barons present, it adds, \" the libere tenentes ac tota communitas regni Scoti\u00e6.\"2 Hitherto, as far as the history of the ancient parlia ment of Scotland has been examined, we have been compelled to be contented with such passages as af ford, not indeed conclusive evidence, but certainly strong presumptions, that from the period of the reign of Baliol, the representatives of the burghs appear to 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 290.

But we have now reached the parliament which was held by Bruce at Cambuskenneth in 1326 ; and although, with the many other precious instruments which might have thrown a flood of light upon the obscure paths through which we have been travelling, the original record of this assembly of the Estates has perished, an indenture has been preserved, which proves, beyond a doubt, that, besides the earls, ba rons, and freeholders, or libere tenentes, the repre sentatives of the burghs sat in this parliament, and formed the third Estate of the national council.1 The expressions of the historian, Fordun, upon this occa sion, are different from what he generally uses : \" In this year,\" says he, \" at Cambuskenneth, the clergy of Scotland, with the earls, barons, and whole body of the nobles, along with the people there assembled, took the oaths of allegiance and homage to David, the son and heir of their king.\" It may be conjec tured that, on such an occasion, Bruce, whose health was fast declining, might be naturally desirous that the oaths to his son and successor should be tendered in the midst of the most numerous and solemn con course of his people. It may be presumed, therefore, on very strong grounds, that the chief men of every burgh in the kingdom would be admitted into the parliament at Cambuskenneth. This is the last parliament of Bruce, regarding which we have any certain account. There can be 1 This indenture is printed in Kaimes' Law Tracts, Appendix, No. 4.

It is satisfactory to find that the expressions of this treaty clearly demonstrate that the burghs had been consulted in its formation. It is said to be concluded with consent of the pre lates, earls, barons, and other heads of the communi ties of the kingdom of Scotland.1 In that disgraceful parliament held by Edward Ba liol at Edinburgh, in 1333, in which this prince gave up the independence of the nation, and, by a solemn instrument, actually dismembered the kingdom, and annexed a great portion of its territory to England, the burghs did not appear.2 It is evident, indeed, from the account of it preserved in the original re cord in the F\u0153dera, that the assembly was not pro perly a parliament, but a meeting of Baliol's adhe rents, held under the direction and control of Geof frey Scrope, chief justice of England. From this period, for more than twenty years, the history of the country presents us with a frightful picture of foreign and domestic war ; of the minority and captivity of the sovereign ; and the intrigues and treasons of the nobles : with the enemy constantly at 1 Robertson's Index, p. 103. - Rymcr's F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 590."], [314, "278 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. their gates, and fighting daily for their existence as a people, no parliament appears to have been assem bled ; and the different regents who successively held the reins of government were summarily chosen by the voices of the few nobles who continued to strug gle for their liberty.1 There is not preserved to us a single document from which we can conclude that the prelates, the barons, and the community of burghs, ever sat together in parliament during the whole of this disastrous period ; but, to this era of obscurity and darkness, there succeeds a gleam of light, which suddenly breaks in upon us in the negotiations for the ransom of the captive king, and sets the question, as to the constitution of the Scottish parliament in 1357 very nearly at rest. In a parliament held this year at Edinburgh, we know, from the original in strument preserved in the F\u0153dera,2 that the represen tatives or delegates of the seventeen royal burghs formed the third Estate in this great council ; and that, when the prelates and the barons chose their respective commissioners to carry through the final arrangement regarding the restoration of their king, and the payment of his ransom, the royal burghs no- 1 In Fordun, b. xiii. c. 22, 25, 27, there are notices of the elec tion of the Earl of Mar as regent, in a parliament held at Perth, 1332, and of the same high office being conferred, successively, on Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, in the same calamitous year, and on Archibald Douglas, in 1333 ; but the times were full of war and trouble, and all record of these elections has perished. 2 F\u0153dera, vol. vi. pp. 43, 44, 45.

It is important to observe that, in the record of the pro ceedings of this national council, which may be said to be the first Scottish parliament in which there is unquestionable evidence of the presence of the bo roughs as the third Estate, the expressions employed in the instrument in Rymer are exactly the same as those which I have considered as demonstrative of the presence of the royal burghs in the parliaments of Baliol and Bruce. \" De consensu et voluntate omnium comitum, procerum, et Baronum et Com munitatis regni Scoti\u00e6.\"2 The records of the parlia ments which were held by David after his return to his dominions in 1363 at Scone, are so mutilated and imperfect, that we are only able to say that the three 1 Supra, p. 113. 2 The consideration into which the burghs or the merchants of Scotland had arisen during these tedious negotiations for David's liberty, which called for an immediate supply of money, is evident from a deed in Rymer, vol. v. p. 723, in which the clergy, nobles, and merchants of Scotland, gave their oaths for the fulfilment of certain conditions. It is dated 1351.

Estates were present -,1 but in the original record of the parliament held at Perth in 1364, it is not only certain that the representatives of the royal burghs formed the third Estate, but the names of the worthy merchants who filled this important situation have been preserved.2 Again, in a parliament held at Scone on the 20th July, 1366, we find it stated in the initiatory clause, that it consisted of those who were summoned to the parliament of the king accord ing to ancient use and wont, namely, the bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, and free tenants, who hold of the king in capite, and certain burgesses who were summoned from each burgh to attend at this time ; whilst, in a subsequent meeting of the great national council in the autumn of the year 1367, we find the earliest appearance of those committees of parliament which became afterwards so common, and, in all probability, gave rise to the later institution of the Lords of the Articles. It is stated that, in con sequence of its being held at this season, \" causa autumni,\" certain persons had been elected to hold the parliament, while permission was given to the rest of the members to return to their own business.3 On this occasion thirteen burgesses were chosen by their brethren ; the burghs of Edinburgh, Aber deen, Perth, Dundee, Montrose, and Haddington, each being represented by two burgesses, and the burgh of Linlithgow by a single delegate.

In the first the practice of obtaining a leave of ab sence, and sending commissioners in their place, ap pears to be fully recognised ; and in the second we find the same measure again adopted, which is above alluded to, of making a selection of a committee of certain members, to whom the judicial business of the parliament, and the task of deliberating upon the affairs of the country, were intrusted, leave be ing given to the rest of the members to take their departure, and attend to their own concerns. It has been already remarked,1 that, in the last parliament of David the Second, which was held at Perth on the 18th of February, 1369, this new practice of choosing committees of parliament was carried to a dangerous excess. To one of these committees, composed of six members selected from the clergy, fourteen of the barons, and six of the burgesses, was committed the decision of all judicial pleas and complaints, which be longed to the parliament ; and to the other, which in cluded in its numbers the clergy and the barons, alone, was intrusted the consideration of certain spe cial and secret affairs touching the sovereign and the kingdom, which it was thought expedient should be 1 History, vol. ii. p. 187."], [318, "282 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. discussed by them alone previous to their coming to the knowledge of the great council of the nation.1 I have endeavoured to trace the history of the an cient constitution of our Scottish parliament from the earliest appearance of a national council to the era of the full admission of the burghs as a third Estate. Guided in our investigation by the sure light of au thentic records and muniments, or of almost contem porary historians, we have seen the earliest appear ance of the commons or burghs under Baliol, their increased consequence in the conclusion of the reign of Bruce, and their certain and established right of representation during the reign of David the Second ; and, in concluding this division of our subject, it may be remarked, that the employment of the great na tional council, in a judicial as well as a legislative capacity, cannot be traced to an earlier period than the reign of this monarch. The elucidation of its subsequent history, under the princes of the house of Stewart, will appear in its own place. 1 Robertson's Parliamentary Records, p. 117."], [319, "283 SECTION IV. EARLY COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION. In the course of these observations upon the con dition of the country during this remote period of our history, its commercial wealth, and the state of its early manufactures, are subjects of high national interest, upon which it will be necessary to offer some remarks ; and both points are so intimately con nected with the navigation of the country, that it will be impossible to advert to the one without at tending to the other. The high prosperity of the kingdom under the reign of Alexander the Third has already been noticed ; and there is even reason to believe that, at an infinitely more remote period, the Scots had established a commercial intercourse with the Continent, and, in the end of the sixth century, imported fine linen from foreign parts.1 Under the reign of Macbeth, a monarch whom the patient re search of our antiquaries has rescued from the region of fable, and the immortal libels of Shakspeare, the kingdom was wealthy ; and, from the discovery of large quantities of money, coined by Canute, the al most contemporary king of England, we may infer the existence of some foreign commerce. It is cer tain that, in a pilgrimage to Rome, this king exhibit- 1 Macpherson's Notes on Winton, vol. ii. p. 479."], [320, "284 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ed a liberality, in distributing money to the poor. which was considered remarkable even in that rich resort of opulent pilgrims.1 The rich dresses which were imported by Malcolm the Third; the Asiatic luxuries of Alexander the First ; and the grant by Edgar, to the church of Durham, of the duties on ships which entered the ports of a certain district in his dominions ; all denote the existence of a trade with foreign countries. Under the subsequent prosperous and able reign of David the First, the evidence of the cartularies, and the minute and interesting details of his friend and faithful biographer, Ethelred, enable us to form some idea of the commercial wealth of the nation. Scotland was, at this period, visited by many foreign ships ; and the merchants of distant countries traded and exchanged their commodities with the opulent burghers and merchants. It was the praise of this monarch, to use the language of Fordun, \" that he enriched the ports of his kingdom with foreign mer chandise, and to the wealth of his own land added the riches and the luxuries of foreign nations ; that he changed its coarse stuffs for precious vestments, and covered its ancient nakedness with purple and fine linen.\"2 In his reign the ports of Perth, Stirling, and Aberdeen were the resort of foreign merchant ships, which paid certain duties to government before they were permitted to trade ; and out of the sums thus 1 A.

These wealthy citizens had been wel comed into England by the wisdom of Henry the First, and had settled upon the district contiguous to the Marches, from which they gradually spread into the sister country during the reign of Alexander the First. In 1155, Henry the Second, with angry and shallow policy, banished all foreigners from his do minions ;2 and the Flemings, of whom there were then great numbers in England, eagerly flocked into the neighbouring country, which offered them a near and safe asylum. Here, without losing their own particular tendency to make money by trade, and to establish commercial settlements, they accommodated themselves to the warlike habits of the people, and willingly served in the king's army ;3 whilst, at the same time, their wealth and industry as traders, fish ers, manufacturers, and able and intelligent crafts men, made them excellent instruments, in the hands of David the First, for humanizing and ameliorating 1 Dalrymple's Collections, p. 386. 4 Brompton, pp. 1043, 52. 3 Gulielmus Neubrigensis, p. 232."], [322, "286 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the character of his people, and introducing amongst them habits of regular civil occupation. We can trace the settlement of these industrious citizens, du ring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in almost every part of Scotland ; in Berwick, the great mart of our foreign commerce ; in the various towns along the east coast ; in St Andrews, Perth, Dumbarton, Ayr, Peebles, Lanark, Edinburgh ; and in the dis tricts of Renfrewshire, Clydesdale, and Annandale. There is ample evidence of their industrious pro gress in Fife, in Angus, in Aberdeenshire, and as far north as Inverness and Urquhart. It would even appear, from a record of the reign of David the Se cond, that the Flemings had procured from the Scot tish monarchs a right to the protection and exercise of their own laws.1 It has been ingeniously conjectured, that the story of Malcolm the Fourth having dispos sessed the ancient inhabitants of Moray, and of his planting a new colony in their stead, may have origi nated in the settlement of the Flemings in that remote and rebellious district.2 The early domestic manufac tures of our country, the woollen fabrics which are mentioned by the statutes of David,2 and the dyed and shorn cloths which appearin the charter of William the Lion to the burgh of Inverness,3 must have been great ly improved by the superior dexterity and knowledge of the Flemings ; and the constant commercial inter- 1 Robertson's Index, p. 61. 2 Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. i. p. 628. 3 See the charter of William the Lion to the royal burgh of Perth, in Cant's Muse's Threnodie, vol. ii. p. 6."], [323, "EARLY COMMERCE. 287 course which they kept up with their own little states, could not fail to be beneficial in importing the know ledge and the improvements of the Continental na tions into the remoter country where they had set tled.1 The insular situation of Scotland, and the bois terous seas and high rocky coasts which defend it, must have early accustomed its inhabitants to direct their attention to the arts of ship-building and na vigation. Other causes increased this. The early intercourse and colonization of the Western Islands, and of the mainland districts of Caithness and Su therland by the Norwegians, the constant piratic ex peditions and naval battles which took place between this powerful people, and the independent sea kings who broke off from their dominion, could not fail to nurse up a race of hardy sailors, and intelligent mer cantile adventurers ; and these, on becoming subjects and vassals of the Scottish kings, brought with them a stock of courage, skill, and enterprise, which was of the highest value to the nation. It is singular, too, that in these remote islands, when under the domi nion of the Norwegians, there is reason to believe that the arts and manufactures had been carried to a high pitch of excellence. The Hebridean chiefs, in the exercise of piracy, the principal source of their wealth, and then esteemed an honourable profession, had made descents upon most of the maritime countries of the west of Europe, had become acquainted with the 1 Macpherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. i. p. 403."], [324, "288 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. navigation of their seas, and carried off, to their island homes, the silks, the armour, the golden vases, the jewelled ornaments, and the embroidered carpets and tapestry which they plundered from the castles, churches, and palaces of the west.1 Their skill in navigation, and the formidable fleets which they could launch against their enemies, are attested in many passages of their own historians. Alan Lord of Galloway, one of those independent princes who often disdained to acknowledge the sovereignty of Scotland, fitted out a fleet of a hundred and fifty ships, and drove Olave the Black King of Man from his dominions.2 At an era anterior to this, Reginald Somerlid, who was then the king of Man, was so opulent as to purchase the whole of Caithness from William the Lion, an exception being specially made of the yearly revenue due to the sovereign.3 Ewen of Argyle, one of these island chiefs, agreed, at a very early period, probably towards the conclu sion of the reign of Alexander the Second, to pay to the Scottish monarch an annual tribute of three hun dred and twenty merks.4 Instructed by the vicinity of such enterprising na vigators, and aware of the high importance of a naval force, our early sovereigns made every effort to attain it.

We are entitled to infer from this remarkable fact, that the ship carpenters of Scot land had acquired a reputation at this period which had made them celebrated even in foreign countries ; and it furnishes another proof of those vast forests of oak and fir which at this period covered the greater part of the north of Scotland.2 In naval and commercial enterprise, as in all the other arts and employments which contributed to in crease the comforts and the luxuries of life, the clergy appear to have led the way. They were the great est shipowners in the country ; and the Cartularies contain frequent exemptions from the duties generally levied on the merchantmen who imported foreign manufactures, which are granted to the ships of the bishops, abbots, and priors, who embarked the wealth 1 Chronicon Manni\u00e6, p. 36. 2 Math.

At this period the staple exports of Scotland seem to have been wool, skins, hides, and salted fish, in which there is evidence of a flourishing and con stant trade.1 For live stock also, embracing cattle, horses, and the indigenous sheep of the country, there seems to have been a frequent foreign demand ; but the woollen and linen manufactures were too coarse to compete with the finer stuffs of England, Flanders, and Italy, and were probably exclusively employed for the clothing of the lower classes. Still, there is ample proof that, limited as was this list of exports, the wealth of the country, even in those districts which were considered especially wild and savage, wTas very considerable. Under William the Lion, Gilbert, the lord of Galloway, was able, from the resources of his own exchequer, to offer to pay to Henry the Second a yearly tribute of two thousand merks of silver, five hundred cows, and five hundred swine.2 From the account which has already been given of the wealth of the royal revenue under our early kings, and of the large sums of money expended on various public occa sions by David, \"William, Alexander, and Malcolm the Fourth, we must infer a correspondent increase of wrealth in the different classes of the kingdom, espe cially in the mercantile and trading part of the com munity ; and it is not improbable that many of these 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 95.

On one memorable occasion, where William the Lion had engaged to pay to John of England fifteen thousand merks, we have seen that the burghs contributed six thousand, a sum equal to more than sixty thousand pounds of our present money ;l and the large sums collected, or rather ex torted, by the Papal legates during the reign of Alex ander the Second, evince very considerable wealth at this period.2 A poor country would not have at tracted such frequent visits from those insatiable emissaries of the Pope ; and his Holiness not only continued his extortion under the reign of Alexander the Third,3 but appears to have been highly incensed when the ambition of Edward the First interfered with his cupidity. The mercantile wealth, and the general prosperity of the kingdom during the reign of Alexander the Third, have been already noticed ; and the arrival of the Lombard merchants with a proposal of establishing settlements in Scotland, is an event which itself speaks a high degree of progress in mercantile wealth and opulence.

Voyages had become more distant, the va rious countries which were visited more numerous, the risks of loss by piracy, tempest, or arrestment in foreign ports, more frequent ; and it is a remarkable circumstance that the king, in consequence of this, became alarmed, and published an edict, by which he forbade the exportation of any merchandise from his dominions ; \" which measure,\" observes the an cient historian, \" was not carried into execution with out difficulty ; and a year had not expired, when the vessels of different nations, laden with merchandise, came into our ports, anxious to exchange their com modities for the productions of our country ; upon which it was enacted that burgesses alone should be permitted to engage in traffic with these new comers.\" It is evident from all this, that the Scottish exports were in great demand in foreign markets ; and the short-sighted policy of Alexander in suddenly stop ping the trade which wTas thus carried on, created a strong sensation even in foreign countries, and occa sioned an immediate resort of foreign vessels into the Scottish ports. Upon this occasion the Lombards, in their proposals to erect factories in Scotland, evi dently intended to step into the lucrative trade which the Scottish merchants, in consequence of the new edict of the king, were no longer permitted to carry on.1 One of the most interesting subjects connected 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 130.

It is evident that the Celtic inhabitants of the country were averse to settle or congregate in towns ; and that, as long as Scotland continued under a purely Celtic government, the habits of the people opposed themselves to any thing like regular industry or improvement.1 Even so late as the present day, the pacific pursuits of agriculture, the labours of the loom, or the higher branches of trade and commer cial adventure, are uncongenial to the character of this unsettled, though brave and intrepid, race ; and the pages of contemporary and authentic historians bear ample testimony to the bitter and inveterate spirit with which they resisted the course of civilisa tion, and the enlightened changes introduced by our early kings. So much, indeed, is this the case, that the progress of improvement is directly commensu rate with the gradual pressing back of the Celtic po pulation into the remoter northern districts, by the more industrious race of the Saxons and the Anglo- Normans. In this enquiry, a, description has already been given of the royal and baronial castles of Scotland in those remote periods, and of the clusters of hamlets which arose under their walls, inhabited by the re tainers of the prince or- the noble upon whose bounty they lived, and whose power protected them from 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 41."], [330, "294 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. molestation. To these small vill\u00e6, and to the secu rity which they enjoyed from the vicinity of the cas tle, is to be traced the first appearance of towns in Scotland, as in the other countries of Europe. Nor were the rich religious houses less influential than the royal and baronial castles ; for their proprie tors, themselves the most opulent and enterprising class in the community, encouraged the industry of their numerous vassals, and delighted to see the houses and settlements of wealthy and industrious artisans arising under the walls of their monastery.1 The motives for the care and protection extended to such infant villages and communities are easily dis coverable, if we recollect the description already given of the condition of a great portion of the lower or ders of the people, out of which class the manu facturers and traders arose. They were slaves ; and their children, their wrealth, and the profits of their industry, exclusively belonged to their lords : so that a settlement of wealthy manufacturers, or a commu nity of successful and enterprising artisans, under the walls of a royal castle, or rich abbey, or within the territory of a feudal noble, was just so much mo ney added to the revenue of the king, the baron, or the abbot.2 As wealth increased with security and industry, the inhabitants of these communities be gan gradually to purchase their liberty from their lords,3 and to form themselves into insulated associa- 1 Houard, Traites sur les Coutumes Anglo-Normandes, vol. ii. pp. 361, 362.

It was soon discovered by the monarchs of Scot land, that these opulent communities of merchants formed so many different points, from which civili sation and improvement gradually extended through the country ; and the consequence of this discovery was, their transformation, by the favour of the sove reign, into chartered corporations of merchants, en dowed with particular privileges, and living under the especial protection and superintendence of the king.2 In this manner, at a very early period, royal burghs arose in Scotland. The various steps of this pro gress were, in all probability, nearly the same as those which are pretty clearly seen in the diploma tic collections and ancient muniments of different published by Mr Manning, we find a very early instance of this, enti tled, \" Testificatio Manumissionis Aelwigi Rufi.\" It is as follows : \" Hie notificatur in hoc Christi libro. quod Aelfwig Rufus Rede mit seipsum de Aelfigo abbate, et toto conventu, cum una libra.

This policy seems to have been carried so far, that, in 1173, under Wil liam the Lion, the towns and boroughs of Scotland are spoken of, by an English historian, as almost exclu sively peopled by his countrymen ;3 and so late as the time of Edward the First, when this king, previous to his decision of the question of the succession, made a progress through Scotland, and compelled the in habitants to take the oath of homage, the proportion 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 305. 2 Ducange, Glossar. voce Commimia. 3 Gulielm.

These royal burghs, and the lands which were annexed to them, were the exclusive property of the king, sometimes held in his own hands, and possessed in demesne, but more ge nerally let out to farm. In this respect, the condition of the towns and burghs of England in the time of the Conqueror, as shown in Doomsday Book, was nearly similar to the state in which we find them in Scotland, from the reign of Alexander the First, to the accession of Robert the Second.2 For the houses and factories possessed by the merchants, a certain rent was due to the exchequer ; and previous to their appearance as a third Estate in the great national council, the king appears to have had a right of calling upon his boroughs to contribute aids or grants of money out of their coffers on any occasion of emergency.3 The 1 Prynne's Edward the First, pp. 653, 663, inclusive. - Macpherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. i. p. 297. 3 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 529."], [334, "298 HISTORY\" OF SCOTLAND.

The boroughs which composed it, were the four oldest in the kingdom, Berwick, Rox burgh, Stirling, and Edinburgh ; and it was the duty of the Chamberlain of Scotland to hold a court or ayr2 once every year, at Haddington, to which the four boroughs sent four commissioners, for the pur pose of hearing and deciding upon the appeals brought before them.

It was known by the name of the Assisa Burgorum, and, in an interpolated and imperfect state, has reached our own times. In the famous state paper of Edward the First, known by the title of an \" Ordinatio super stabilitate terr\u00e6 Sco- ti\u00e6,\" and published in 1305, the laws which King David had enacted, are commanded to be read by the English guardian or lieutenant, in presence of the good people of the land; and in a charter which is granted by William the Lion to the burgh of Glasgow in 1 176, that monarch refers to the assizes of his burghs, as an established code of law.1 It is the judicious ob- servation of Chalmers, that as Malcolm the Fourth is known not to have been a legislator, these assizes must be ascribed to David, and this is confirmed by the ancient and respectable authority of Fordun.2 The policy of the sovereign in the erection of these privileged communities, was gradually imitated by the religious houses, and more rarely by the greater barons, who granted exclusive privileges to the towns or villages upon their territories, and turned their 1 Gibson's Hist, of Glasgow, p. 301.

In this way Selkirk was indebted for its first passage from a village into a borough to the abbot of Kelso ; St Andrews, Glasgow, and Bre ehin, to the bishops of these sees ; NewTburgh to the abbot of Lindores. The town of Renfrew was ex pressly granted by David the First to Walter the son of Alan ; Lauder was early the property of the an cient family of the Morvilles ; and Lochmaben, in consequence of a grant by David the First, belonged to the ancestors of Bruce. The rents of the houses and of the lands of these boroughs ; the customs levied upon the ships which traded to such as were situated on the sea coast, or on navigable rivers ; and in all probability certain proportions of the profits of the various tradesmen and guild brethren who inhabited them, belonged to the spiritual or temporal lord up on whose lands they wrere erected, and whose favour and protection they enjoyed. If in the various revo lutions and changes of the times, his lands happen ed to escheat to the crown, the whole wealth which belonged to them, the granges, castles, manors, vil lages, and boroughs, became the property of the sove reign ; and in this way, in the course of years, many baronial or ecclesiastical boroughs were changed into royal ones. Although, however, the rise of these trading communities was in the first instance emi nently beneficial to Scotland, and, it cannot be doubt ed, contributed to give an impulse to the industry of the people ; yet as soon as this commercial and ma-"], [337, "301 EARLY COMMERCE. nufacturing spirit was once roused into activity, the monopolizing principle upon which the borough sys tem was founded, by giving a check to competition, must have fatally retarded the improvement of the country. In the mean time, however, under the se verity of the feudal system, boroughs were in their first introduction cities of freedom ; their inhabitants were no longer in the degrading condition of slaves, who could be transferred like cattle or common pro perty from one master to another ; and we know, from the statutes of the burghs, that the same law prevail ed in our own country as in England and France, by which a vassal or slave, if he escaped from his feudal superior, and was so fortunate as to purchase a house within a burgh, and live therein for a year and a day, without being claimed by his master, became a free man for ever.1 It was probably in consequence of this law, that a remarkable increase took place in the trade and manu factures of Scotland. During the long period of fo reign war, of civil faction, and domestic feuds, which fill up the history of the country from the death of Alexander the Third to the settlement of the king dom under Bruce, and after this, from the death of Bruce to the accession of Robert the Second, the con stant changes and convulsions in the state of private property, threw great multitudes of the lower classes 1 M'Pherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. i. p. 307.

These fu gitives would naturally seek refuge in the cities and burghs belonging to the king ; and bring with them an additional stock of enterprise and industry to the mercantile corporations, whose protection they enjoy ed ; in the course of years many of them must have risen to the state of freemen ; and, in consequence of this extraordinary increase in the number of free merchants and enterprising traders, the wealth of the kingdom, during the latter part of the reign of Da vid the Second, became proportionally great. It un fortunately happened, that the enormous drain of spe cie, occasioned by the payment of the king's ransom, and the personal expenses of 'the monarch, with the large sums of money levied for the maintenance of ambassadors and commissioners, with their expensive suites of knights, and other attendants, soon swal lowed up the profits of trade, and reduced the king dom to the very brink of bankruptcy. At a remote period, under Malcolm the Fourth, the great mart of foreign commerce was Berwick. A contemporary English historian distinguishes it as a noble town, and as it possessed many ships, and enjoyed more foreign commerce than any other port in Scotland,1 it shared the fate of all other opulent towns on the coast, in being exposed to the descents of the piratic fleets of the north. Erlind, a Norwe gian and Earl of Orkney, in 1156, carried off a ship belonging to a citizen of Berwick, whose name was Cnut the Opulent ; and we learn from Torfaeus, who 1 Gulielm.

Under succeeding sovereigns it in creased in trade and opulence; till we find it, in the reign of Alexander the Third, enjoying a prosperity which threw every other Scottish port into the shade, and caused the contemporary author of the Chroni cle of Lanercost to distinguish it by the name of a Second Alexandria.1 It enjoyed a lucrative export of wool, wool-fells, and hides, to Flanders ; it was by the agency of the merchants of Berwick that the pro duce of Roxburgh, Jedburgh, and the adjacent coun try, in these same commodities, was shipped for fo reign countries, or sold to the Flemish Company es tablished in that city; its export of salmon was very great ; and the single fact, that its customs, un der Alexander the Third, amounted to the sum of L.2197, 8s. Sterling, while the whole customs of England, in 1287, produced only L.8411, 19s. ll^d. amply demonstrates its extraordinary wealth.8 At this period, the constitution of the towns and burghs in Scotland appears to have been nearly the same as in the sister country. Berwick was govern ed by a mayor, whose annual allowance for his charges of office was ten pounds, a sum equivalent to more than four hundred pounds of our present money.3 Under 1 History, vol. i. p. 111. 2 M'Pherson's Annals of Commerce, Rymer, vol. ii. pp. 605, 613.

The comparative state of the trade and exports of the remaining burghs of the kingdom, at this early period, cannot be easily ascertained. Perth, which had become very opulent and flourishing in the time of William the Lion, by whom it was erected into a royal burgh, increased in its wealth and consequence under Malcolm the Fourth, who made Scone, the neighbouring monastery, the principal seat of his kingdom. The resort of the court, and the increased demand for the articles of domestic manufacture and foreign commerce, gave a stimulus to the enterprise and industry of the infant burgh ; and a contempo rary poet, whose works have been preserved by Cam- 1 Prynne's Edward I. pp. 653, 654.

Indeed, immediate ly before the commencement of the war of liber ty, the commercial transactions of the country were of consequence enough to induce the merchants of St Omers, and partners of the Florentine houses of Pullici and Lambini to have correspondents in Scot land ; and, about the same period, we find that Richard le Furbur, a trader of the inland town of Roxburgh, had sent factors or supercargoes to ma nage his business in foreign countries, and in various parts of Britain. The list of her exports, at this time, embraced the same articles as those already described : wool, skins, hides, and wool-fells ; great quantities of fish, salted and cured f horses, sheep, and cattle;3 and, more rarely, pearls, falcons, and greyhounds. It is sin gular to find so precious an article as pearls amongst the subjects of Scottish trade, yet the fact rests on good authority. The Scottish pearls in the possession of Alexander the First were celebrated in distant coun tries for their extreme size and beauty ; and, as early 1 Necham apud Gough's Camden's Brit. vol. iii. p. 393. - Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 40, 911, 929, 941, 944. 3 Ibid. p. 881.

Under the reign of Bruce, and during the long war with England, every possible effort was made by Ed ward the First and his successor, to crush and extin guish the foreign trade of Scotland, but the success does not appear to have been in any degree propor tionate to their exertions. All English or Irish mer chants were prohibited, under the severest penalties, from engaging in any transactions with that coun try ; and repeated requests were addressed to the rich republics of the low countries, to the courts of Flanders, and the Dukes of Brabant, to induce them to break off all traffic with the Scots ;: but the exertions of contraband traders and privateer vessels eluded the strictness of the prohibitions against Eng lish and Irish trade,2 and the Flemings and Brabant ers steadily refused to shut their ports against any nation which could pay for their commodities.

Yet although this branch of national wealth was rendered less productive, other sources were open ed peculiar to war. The immense plunder which was taken at Bannockburn, the large sums of money paid by the English nobles and barons for their ransom ; the subsequent plunder in the repeated invasions of England, and the frequent and heavy sums which were subscribed by the Border counties, to induce the Scottish leaders to spare their towns and villages, greatly enriched the kingdom, and provided a mass of capital which is distinctly perceptible in the in creased commercial speculation of the subsequent reign, and in the remarkable and successful efforts made by the nation in fitting out a navy. Previous to the accession of David the Second, we have already seen that little traces of a regular naval force exist in Scotland ; and although the fleets of William the Lion, and that of his successor Alexander the Second, are commemorated in the Chronicle of Man, it seems probable that these naval armaments were furnish ed by the island vassals, who owned the superiority 7"], [346, "310 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of the Scottish crown, and who held their lands by the tenure of furnishing a certain number of galleys for the use of the king.1 The maritime exploits of these kings were temporary and insulated, and the same observation applies to the naval expeditions of their successors. It appears, indeed, from a passage in the chamberlain rolls of Alexander the Third, that, in 1263, this monarch was in possession of se veral vessels, which, under the direction of the Earl of Menteth, were built in the port of Ayr, and that two hundred oars were manufactured for their use ;2 but it is evident, from Alexander declining any naval contest with the King of Norway, that his fleet could neither have been numerous nor powerful. Robert Bruce's reign being principally occupied with a land war, his efforts for distressing his enemy by sea, were mostly confined to the commissioning piratic ships from the Flemings and Genoese, which cruised upon the English coasts, and in the double capacity of traders and ships of war, landed their cargoes in Scotland and attacked the English merchantmen and victuallers. Yet there is evidence in that very inte resting portion of the chamberlain accounts which relate to the expenditure of Bruce at his palace of Cardross the year before his death, that he and his old companion in arms, the great Randolph, were anxiously directing their attention to the subject of shipping and navigation.

The Scottish ships of war, along with numerous squadrons of foreign privateers, in the pay of the Scots, swept the seas round England, plundered their merchant vessels, and made repeated and successful descents upon the coast, burning and destroying the seaport towns, and crea ting extreme alarm in the country. In 1334, a fleet of Scottish ships of war threatened a descent on the coast of Suffolk ; in the subsequent year, twenty-six galleys and other ships were hover ing and watching their opportunity for attack off the coasts of Chester and Durham ; and not long after this, notwithstanding the utmost exertions by the English government to fit out a fleet which should put an end to the naval aggressions of the Scots, and precautions taken to spread the alarm in case of any hostile descents, by lighting beacons upon the cliffs above the sea ; the towns of Portsmouth, Fodynton, Portseye, and Easten, were burnt and plundered, and the country threatened with invasion by an immense fleet of foreign ships and galleys, whose approach is described by Edward the Second in an order address ed to the sheriffs of England, and evidently written under extreme anxiety and apprehension.1 Yet the probability is, that none of these vessels were the property of the king, but merchant ships of Scottish and foreign traders fitted up for the expedition as 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 299,317. vol. i.

There appears to have been no regular perma nent naval force of any consequence maintained in either.1 In England, as the emergency of the moment required, the monarch was in the habit of directing his writs to the wrardens of the Cinque Ports, and to the magistrates of the different seaports, empower ing them to press into the service, and instantly arm and victual any number of vessels he deemed necessary, and to commission such merchantmen as were fond of the adventure, to fit out their traders as naves guerrin\u00e6, or ships of war,2 with the right of attacking the enemies of the king, under the condi tion of giving up half the profits in the event of a successful capture.3 We may form some idea of the size and strength of these vessels from an order issued by Edward the Third during his Scottish war, to the mayor of Bristol, in which this magistrate is com manded to arrest three of the largest ships then in the port of that city.

In 1335, a very large foreign ship, laden with arms, provisions, and warlike stores, arrived in the port of Dumbarton, and for the purpose of intercepting her, Edward not only ordered two of the largest merchantmen of Bristol to be manned and provisioned as ships of war, but com manded Roger de Hegham, his admiral of the West ern fleet, to fit out two other vessels, with a double complement of men, to be employed apparently on the same service.2 In 1357, three Scottish ships of war, manned with three hundred picked soldiers, infested the East coast, and grievously annoyed the English commerce. This large complement of soldiers must have been exclusive of the sailors employed to navigate the ships, and proves them to have been very powerful, when compa red with the ordinary vessels of the time.3 In the same 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 231. 24th April, 1333. \u2022 Ibid. vol. i. p. 340. 3 Knighton, Col. 3 Knighton, Col. 2617."], [350, "314 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. year, we have seen that the Scottish privateers captu red a vessel called the Beaumondscogge, which was the property of that powerful baron, Henry de Beau mont, who, along with Baliol and the rest of the dis inherited nobles, succeeded in driving David the Se cond from the throne ; and soon after the united fleets of the Scots and their allies increased in numbers and audacity to such a degree, that the English coasts were kept in a state of continual terror. The merchant men did not dare to sail except in great squadrons, and with a convoy of ships of war ; and even when riding at anchor within the harbours, were cut out and carried off by the superior naval skill and courage of the Scottish seamen, and their allies.1 In a re markable order, addressed by Edward the Third to his admirals and naval captains, this monarch com plains in bitter terms of their base and pusillanimous conduct, in permitting the united fleets of the Scots, French, and Flemings, to capture and destroy the ships of England in the very sight of his own navy, which kept aloof during the action, and did not dare to give battle.2 Such appears to have been the great superiority of the Scottish navy over that of England in the begin ning of the reign of David the Second. Meanwhile, the long and inveterate war between the two coun tries, which arose out of the aggressions of Edward the First, entirely extinguished the regular Scottish 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, pp. 451, 456, 467, 477. 2 Ibid. vol. i. p. 513.

From the year 1291 to 1348 there appear only three safe-conducts for Eng lish merchants, permitting them to trade with Scot land ; and those repeated proclamations which were made against any commercial intercourse, seem to have been so rigorously executed, that in this long interval, embracing more than half a century, we do not find a single passport for a Scottish merchant, allowing him to visit England for the purposes of trade. In 1348 the Scots were included in the truce of Calais ; for the first time since the long war the com merce of England was thrown open to their skill and enterprise ; and, in a very few years, the mer cantile intercourse between the twro countries increas ed to an astonishing and unexampled degree. At the request of the Queen of Scotland, important pri vileges were granted to the Scottish merchants ; the Scottish nobles possessed companies of merchants, who speculated on their account, and under their pro tection ; 1 and we have seen that, instead of the rigid and determined exclusion from all trade with their dominions, which, for so long a time, formed part of the policy of the three Edwards to their Scottish ene mies,2 a system of the utmost liberality and indul gence was pursued, under which the commerce of both countries was carried on with a wonderful de gree of energy and enterprise. 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 758, 823.

The immense sums of money which were drawn from the country for the ransom of the king ; the ex penses incurred by the residence and ransom of the noble prisoners taken in the battle of Durham ; and the reiterated and heavy payments which were made during the various and protracted negotiations with England ; exhibit, in a very striking manner, the en creasing opulence of the country ; and it cannot be doubted, that one great source of this wealth is to be traced to the improved state of the national com merce, and to the increasing wealth of the traders and manufacturers. I shall conclude this sketch of the early commerce and navigation of Scotland, by a few remarks upon the money of those times, and up on the wages of labour, and the prices of the neces saries of life. All the Scottish coins which have yet been dis covered, previous to the reign of Robert the Second, are of silver ; and this fact of itself furnishes, if not absolute proof, at least a strong presumption, that anterior to this period there was no gold coinage in Scotland.1 Of this early silver money the most ancient specimens yet found are the pennies of Alex ander the First, who succeeded to the throne in the commencement of the twelfth century ; after which 1 In a Parliament held at Scone by David the Second, in 1369, there is mention of gold money.

The silver pen- nies of Alexander the First, now extremely rare, are of the same fineness, weight and form, as the contem- porary English coins of the same denomination, and down to the time of Robert the First, the money of Scotland was of precisely the same value and standard as that of England. Towards the conclusion of the reign of William the Lion, that monarch reformed the money, which had been somewhat debased from its for- mer standard ;l perhaps in consequence of an attempt to supply in this way the very large sums which this monarch paid to Richard the First.2 During the suc- ceeding reign, the standard value and the device conti- nued the same as under William ; but almost imme- diately after the accession of Alexander the Third, the ministry of this infant sovereign borrowed from Eng- land what was deemed an improvement in the mode of stamping the reverse. The history of this altera- tion is curious. It appears that in 1248, the Sterling- money of England had been defaced, by clipping, to such a degree, that the letters of the inscription were almost entirely cut away, and the delinquents were suspected to be the Jews, the Caursini, and the Fle mish wool merchants.3 At a meeting of the king's 1 M'Pherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. i. p. 356. 2 Wynton Chron. vol. i. p. 342.

For tunately this advice, which marks a very rude age, and a limited knowledge on the subject, was not adopted ; but proclamation was made that all the defaced coin should be brought into the king's ex changes, and that a new coinage should be struck, out of which those who brought in the clipped mo ney were to be paid weight for weight. On the old coins, the cross upon the reverse side had only reach ed half way from the centre to the edge, in conse quence of which, an expert clipper might have pared away a considerable breadth, without much chance of detection ; but, now the expedient was adopted, of carrying the arms of the cross, through the letters of the legend, and a border of small beads was added round the outer extremity ; so that the money could not be clipped, without at least a greater chance of discovery.1 The immediate adoption of this clumsy expedient in Scotland was probably occasioned by the same abuse of clipping having been practised in that country.2 1 \" Ut non sine evidenti, et valde notabili dispendio, aliquid inde radi possit vel abscindi.\" Annales Waverlienses, p. 207. 2 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 83.

Like the other alterations in the coin age, it was adopted in imitation of England ; and pro ceeded upon the unjust and erroneous idea, that the wealth of the kingdom might be encreased, by multi plying the number of pennies coined out of the pound of silver. In 1300, Edward the First commanded two hundred and forty-three pennies to be coined out of the standard pound, instead of two hundred and for ty, which was the old rate.' A diminution of three pennies in the value of the pound of account was deemed, perhaps, too trifling and imperceptible a change, to be in any way detrimental ; and the Scot tish monarch not only followed, but went beyond the pernicious example of England ; for, under the ex pectation that the pennies of both kingdoms would, as before, continue to pass indiscriminately, he coined two hundred and fifty-two pennies from the pound weight of silver, \u2014 an impolitic departure from the integrity of the national money, which had hitherto been strict ly observed by the government of the country.2 From this time till 1354 there appears to have 1 Topham's Observations on the Wardrobe Account of Edward the Eleventh, p. 11. \" The pound weight of silver then (31.

In order to pay his creditors with less money than he had borrowed, he commanded two hundred and sixty-six pennies to be made out of the pound of standard silver ; and afterwrards, in the year 1346, he diminished the money still farther, by making two hundred and seventy pennies out of the pound, \u2014 a proceeding by which the people were greatly distress ed, owing to the consequent rise in the prices of all the necessaries of life. In 1354 the Steward, who was now Regent in Scot land, during the captivity of David, imitating this mis taken policy, issued a new coinage, which was not only far below the original standard in value, but even inferior to the money of England, depreciated as it then was. We are informed of this fact, by a proclama tion which the issue of this new money of Scotland drew from Edwrard the Third. In a letter to the Sheriff of Northumberland, the king informs him, that the new money of Scotland, although of the same figure with the old, was not, like it, of the same weight and quality with the Sterling money of Eng- 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. v. p. 813."], [357, "321 EARLY MONEY. land ; and he accordingly commands that officer to make proclamation within his district, that the new Scottish money should be taken only for its value as bullion, and carried to the proper office, to be ex changed for current money ; but that the old money of Scotland, which, as appears from what was above stated, was considerably better than that of England, should be still as current as before.\"1 Soon after the return of David the Second to his dominions, he appointed Adam Torre, a burgess of Edinburgh, and James Mulekin of Florence, joint keepers of the Exchange for all Scotland, and masters of the Mint. Foreigners appear to have been the great coiners or minters of those times. At an earlier period, in 1278, the Exchange at London was under the direction of some Lucca merchants, and Gregory de Rokesley, the mayor.2 In 1366, the Scottish Par liament had ordered the money of the kingdom to be coined of the quality and weight with that of Eng land;3 but, in the subsequent year, the extreme'scar city of silver money, occasioned by the great drain of specie from the country for the king's ransom, and other heavy expenses, created an alarm, which un fortunately caused the Parliament to relapse into the ancient and erroneous notion, that the wealth of the 1 M'Pherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. i. p. 554.

This produced an order, by which it was declared, that the standard pound of silver should be diminished in the weight by ten pennies ; so that henceforth the pound of silver should contain twenty nine shillings and four pennies ; out of which seven pennies were to be taken for the king's use. To understand this order, it must be remembered that th\u00a9 only coins which had yet been struck, either in England or Scotland, were pennies, w7ith their halves and quarters, along with a few groats and half groats ; so that when the Parliament enacted that the pound of silver should contain twenty-nine shillings and four pennies, it was saying in other words that it was to be coined into three hundred and fifty-two pennies ; an enormous departure from the integrity of the old standard of two hundred and forty pennies in the pound. In the same ordinance it is provided that eleven pennies are to be taken for the Master of the Mint and the payment of the workmen, and one penny for the Keeper of the Mint. If to these we add the seven pennies for the King's use, twenty seven shillings and nine pemiies would remain to the merchant for the pound of silver ;J so that, by this change in the coinage, the king practised a very ex tensive and grievous fraud upon his subjects. It is curious to attend for a moment to the conse quences of this depreciation of the money of the coun try.

This they patient ly bore for some time ; but when the immense mor tality occasioned by the pestilence had diminished the number of working men, and thus created a great demand for labour, the survivors naturally seized the opportunity to raise their prices ; and, in conse quence of this, the king, with the advice of his par liament, enacted the Statute of Labourers, \" by which all men and women under sixty years of age, whe ther free or slaves, and having no occupation or pro perty, were compelled to serve any master who hired them, for the same wages which were given before the year 1346, under pain of imprisonment.\" Artifi cers were, at the same time, prohibited from exact ing more than the old wages ; and the butchers, ba kers, brewers, and other dealers in provisions, were strictly enjoined to sell their commodities at reason able prices. The legislators of those remote times had not yet learned that the price of food must be the standard for the price of labour ; and that by depreciating the coin of the kingdom, they raised the prices of the necessaries of life, and compelled the labouring classes to adopt the very conduct of which they complained. 1 Statute 23, Ed.

There can be no doubt that the consequences of the depreciation in Scotland must have been the same as in the sister country ; and the sumptuary laws, which we find enacted towards the conclusion of the reign of David the Second, with the statutes regarding car rying the coin \" furth of the realm,\" are to be traced to the same causes as those which led to the statute of labourers in England.1 The price of labour, of the necessaries of life, and of the articles of comfort or luxury, forms at all times an interesting subject of enquiry, probably from that strong and natural desire which we feel to compare our own condition with that of our fellow-men, how ever remote may have been the period in which they lived. Upon such points, however, previous to the transcription and printing of the Accounts of the Great Chamberlains of Scotland, little satisfactory informa tion could be collected ; for our most ancient histo rians, although they occasionally mark the prices of provisions and of labour, commonly do so in years of scarcity, when the high rate to which they had risen fijced their attention upon the subject ; and upon such data no correct enquiry could be founded.2 These ac counts, on the contrary, as they contain the ordinary and common prices of most articles, are on this, as on all other points which they embrace, our most au thentic and valuable guides. 1 Statuta Davidis II.

A robe for the keeper of the gate of the king's chapel, cost only twenty shillings ; a robe for Patrick de Monte-alto, which was, in all probability, lined with rich furs, cost four pounds ;3 a robe for the clerk of the rolls, twenty-six shillings4 on one occasion, and thirty shil lings on another ;5 whilst John Bysit, a poor monk of Haddington, and one of King Robert's pensioners, was allowed, in 1329, twenty shillings annually for his clothing f and later than this, in 1364, a poor scholar, who is denominated a relation of the king, received from David the Second four pounds annually, to provide himself in food and clothing.7 In 1263, 1 Chamberlain's Accounts, p. 99. 2 Ibid. p. 539. 3 Ibid. pp. 101, 400. * Ibid. p. 101. 4 Ibid. p. 479. 5 Ibid. p. 526. \" Ibid. p. 413."], [368, "332 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND.

Thus, in 1263, we find the dolius or hogshead of red wine, vinum rubrum, sold for thirty-six shillings, and eightpence ; and, at the same time, the hogshead of white wine brought two pounds.1 In other articles of luxury for the table, the great expense seems to have been in spices, con fections, and sweetmeats, in which great quantities of mace, cinnamon, flower of gilliflower, crocus, and ginger, appear, to have been used, upon the prices of which it would be tedious and useless to enlarge. Some idea of the prices of gold and silver plate may be formed from an item in the Chamberlain's Accounts of the year 1364, in which it appears that Adam Torre, burgess of Edinburgh, furnished for the king's table thirteen silver dishes, and six silver saltcellars, for which he was paid seventeen pounds, twelve shillings.2 With regard to the rent aud the value of land at thi speriod, the subject to be investigated in a satisfac tory manner, would lead us into far too wide a field ; but any reader who is anxious to pursue so interest ing an enquiry, will find, in the Cartularies of the different religious houses, and in the valuable infor mation communicated by the books of the Chamber lain's Accounts, a mass of facts, from the comparison of which he might draw very authentic deductions.

For exam ple, in an ancient roll, containing the rents of the Monastery of Kelso, preserved in the Cartulary of that religious house, and drawn up prior to 1320, we find, that the monks of this opulent establishment pos sessed the grange or farm of Reveden in Roxburgh shire, in which they themselves cultivated five caru cates of land. The remainder of the property ap pears to have been divided into eight husbandlands, terr\u0153 husbandorum, for which each of these husband men paid an annual-rent of eighteen shillings. Up on the same grange they had nineteen cottages ; for eighteen of which they received an annual-rent of twelve pennies, and six days' work at harvest and sheep-shearing. The ninth cottage rented at eight een pence, and nine days' harvest work. Upon the same property they had two breweries, yielding a rent of two merks ; and one mill, which brought them nine merks yearly.1 The difficulty here is, to ascertain the size of these husbandlands, in which enquiry, at present, I know not of any certain guide.

And we know that they varied even in England ; and that a deed, quoted in Dugdale's Monasticon, makes the bovate contain only ten acres ; whilst Skene, up on no certain authority, limits it to thirteen. In the same monastic roll we find, that Hugo Cay had a small farm, which consisted of one bovate, for which he paid to the monks a rent of ten shillings ; and for a cottage, with six acres attached to it, and a malt-house, the tenant gave six shillings a-year. At a remote period, under Alexander the Second, the monks of Melrose purchased, from Richard Barnard, a meadow at Farningdun, consisting of eight acres, for thirty-five merks. In 1281, we have already seen, that the portion of Margaret, Princess of Scotland, who wras married to Eric, King of Norway, was four teen thousand merks. At the same time it was sti pulated, that, for one-half of the portion, the King of Scotland might, at his option, assign to the King of Norway, during the continuance of the marriage, rents of lands amounting to a tenth part of the mo ney, or to seven hundred merks yearly ; whilst it was settled, that the princess was to have a jointure of one thousand, four hundred merks ; and in both the public instruments drawn up upon this occasion, an annuity upon the life of Margaret, then in her twen ty-first year, was valued at ten years' purchase.1 In 1 History, vol. i. pp. 55. 56."], [372, "336 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1350, a perpetual annuity of eight merks Sterling, or five pounds, six shillings, and eight pence, secured on land, was bought for one hundred and twenty merks, being exactly fifteen years' purchase.

In reference to any efforts for the religious in- struction or improvement of the people, the Scottish Church was equally cold, idle, and useless, as the rest of the Catholic churches in Europe. Her services were performed, and the Bible was shut up, in an un- known tongue, whilst a system of masses and homi- lies, sometimes not understood even by the priests who performed them, and a blind adoration of relics, saints, and images, usurped the place of that holy and spiritual worship which can alone be acceptable to God. So far, therefore, as regards these paramount objects, there is nothing in our ecclesiastical annals at this period but a dark void ; yet another subject remains upon which it will be necessary to say a few words ; I mean the civil influence which the church exerted upon the character of the government and of the people. And here I cannot help observing, that the history of her early relations with Rome, is cal- culated to place our clergy in a very favourable light as the friends of liberty. The obedience which, in common with the other churches in Christendom, they were disposed to pay to the great head of the Catholic religion, was certainly far from partaking of that obsequious servility, which it was the main ob ject of the Papal throne to impose upon its subjects ; aud it is singular that the same fervid national spirit, VOL. II. Y"], [374, "338 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the same genuine love of independence, which marks the civil, distinguishes also the ecclesiastical annals of the country. The first struggles of our infant church were directed, however, not against the encroachments of the Papal power, but against the attacks of the metropolitan sees of York and Canterbury. It was, at an early period, the ambition of one or other of these potent spiritual principalities to subject the Scot tish primate, the Bishop of St Andrews, to the do minion of the English church, by insisting upon his receiving the rite of consecration from the hands of one of the archbishops of England ; and nearly the whole reign of Alexander the First was spent in a determined resistance against such an encroachment, which concluded in the complete establishment of the independence of the Scottish church. To introduce civilisation and improvement amongst his subjects, and to soften the ferocity of manners and cruelty of disposition, which characterised the differ ent races over whom he ruled, was the great object of Alexander's successor, David the First; and he early found that the clergy, undoubtedly the most enlightened and learned class in the community, were his most useful instruments in the prosecution of this great design. Hence sprung those munificent en dowments in favour of the church, and that generous liberality to the ecclesiastical orders, which has been too rashly condemned, and which was, perhaps, ne cessary, in another point of view, in providing some thing like a counterpoise to the extravagant power of the greater nobles. Under this monarch, the in dividual freedom of the Scottish church was rigidly"], [375, "EARLY SCOTTISH CHURCH. 339 maintained; while, at the same time, it declared it self a willing subject of the Papal throne, and re ceived the legate of the Supreme Pontiff with much humility and veneration. Individual independence, however, was esteemed in no degree incompatible with a general acknowledgment of subjection to the Chair of St Peter ; and it is remarkable, that, at this remote period, there are traces of a freedom of dis cussion, and a tincture of heretical opinions, which, if we may believe an ancient historian, had, for a long time, infected the faith of the Scottish clergy.1 After a feeble and ineffectual attempt, under the reign of Malcolm the Fourth, to renew the attack upon the freedom of the church, which passed over without any important result, the captivity of Wil liam the Lion was ungenerously employed by Henry, to extort an acknowledgment of spiritual, as well as feudal subjection ; but on this memorable occasion, the dexterous diplomacy of the Scottish commission ers, the Bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld, procu red the insertion of a clause in the treaty, which left the question of the independence of the national church open and undecided;2 and at a council, soon after held at Northampton, in the presence of the Papal legate, the Scottish bishops asserted their liberty, declaring, that they never had yielded any subjection to the English church ; and opposing, with a zeal and bold ness which, in this instance, proved successful, the absurd pretensions of the rival sees of York and Can terbury.* 1 J.

Hitherto engaged in repelling these inferior at tacks, the Scottish clergy soon after found themselves involved, by the imperious character of the king, in a serious contention with the Popedom itself. On the death of the Bishop of St Andrews, the chapter chose, for his successor, an English monk, in opposi tion to the wishes of the king, who intended the pri macy for Hugh, his own chaplain. With the vio lence which marked his character, William imme diately seized the revenues of the see ; procured Hugh to be consecrated; put him in possession; and when his rival, who had appealed in person to the Pope, returned with a decision in his favour, he was met by a sentence of banishment, which involved his whole family and connexions in his ruin. Legatine powers were instantly conferred, by the incensed Pontiff, on the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Durham, with a reserved authority to direct the thunder of excommunication against the king, in the event of his contumacy ; and the clergy of the diocese of St Andrews were commanded, upon pain of sus pension, to acknowledge the authority of the extruded primate. But nothing could shake the firmness of William. He replied to this new sentence of the Pope, by banishing every person that dared to yield obe dience to the papal favourite ; upon which the sentence of excommunication wras pronounced by the legates, and the kingdom laid under an interdict. At this cri tical and terrible moment, when the monarch's deter mination to assert his own right of nomination had, in the sense of those times, plunged the land in spi ritual darkness, the Pontiff, Alexander the Third,"], [377, "EARLY SCOTTISH CHURCH. 341 died, and the King of Scotland lost not a moment in sending his commissioners to Rome, who succeeded in procuring from Lucius, the new Pope, an immediate recall of the sentence of excommunication and inter dict, and an ultimate decision in favour of the king. The mode in which this was done was ingeniously calculated to gratify William, without detracting from the supreme authority of the Rom au see. The two rival candidates, John and Hugh, came forward, and resigned into the hands of the Pope all right to the contested bishoprick ; upon which the Pope in stalled Hugh, the favourite of the king, in the throne of St Andrews, and placed John in the inferior see of Dunkeld ; a memorable triumph, which, at a time when the proudest monarchs in Europe were compel led to tremble before the terrors of the Popedom, does honour to the courage and independence of the Scottish king.1 Not long after, Lucius, in his paternal anxiety to demonstrate his affection for his northern son, sent the golden rose to William, an honour rarely bestow ed, and highly prized in that age ; and this distinc tion only led to more important privileges, conferred by Clement the Third, the successor of Lucius, upon the Scottish church.2 It was declared, that in conse quence of William's devoted and zealous affection to the chair of St Peter, (a singular compliment to a prince, who had lately opposed its encroachments in so determined a manner,) the Scottish church was adopted 1 R.

Nenbrig. p. 754."], [378, "342 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. as the special and favourite daughter of the apostolic seat, and declared to be subject to no other interme diate power whatever. To the Pope alone, or to his legate a latere, was permitted the power of publish ing the sentence of interdict and excommunication against Scotland ; upon no one unless a native of Scot land, or at least a person specially deputed for this purpose from the apostolic seat itself, was the office of legate to be conferred ; and in the event of any con troversies arising regarding benefices, it was solemnly enacted, that no appeal should be competent to any foreign tribunal, except that of the Romish church.1 These were high privileges ; they at once put an end to the pretended superiority of the English church, and conferred upon the Scottish prelates a vantage ground, from which they jealously defended and eagerly watched the opportunity to extend and improve their rights. This is strikingly exemplified in the reign of the successor of William, Alexander the Second. The Scottish monarch had dared to make war upon John, King of England, at the time that he had placed himself and his subjects under the peculiar protection of the Pope ; a proceeding which drew down a sentence of excommunication and interdict against Alexander and his subjects. The temper with which this was received, seems to have convinced the Roman court, that the terrors of his spiritual thunder were little felt in Scotland; and fearful perhaps of losing its influence altogether, it permitted the Scottish king, without performing the 1 Chronicon Joan. Brompton, p. 1196."], [379, "EARLY SCOTTISH CHURCH. 343 ignominious penance which generally preceded abso lution, to be again welcomed into the bosom of the church. At the same time, the sentence was removed from the whole body of his lay subjects ; but the pre lates and the rest of the clergy found, that they could only be restored to the exercise of their spiritual functions, upon the payment of very large sums of money to the legate and his deputes.1 Against this extortion, the king, jealous of the rights of his clergy, appealed to Rome, and obtained a judgment in his favour, which declared that the legate had exceeded his powers, and confirmed the privileges of the Scot tish church.2 But this led to a still more important concession. In a moment of carelessness or indulgence, Honorius, listening to the artful representations of the Scottish clergy, who lamented, that, from the want of a Metropolitan, they could not hold a provincial council, and that, in consequence of this misfortune, many enormities had been committed, authorized them to dispense with this necessary solemnity, and to as semble a general council of their own authority. This permission, there cannot be the least doubt, was meant to be temporary ; but it was loosely expressed, and the Scottish clergy instantly perceived and availed them selves of its ambiguity. They affected to understand it as of perpetual authority, and, assembled under its sanction, drew up a distinct form of proceeding by which the Scottish provincial councils should in future be held, instituted the office of Conservator Statuto rum, and continued to assemble frequent provincial 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol, ii. p. 40. 2 Ibid, vol, ii. p. 42."], [380, "344 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. councils, without any further application for the con sent of the Holy see1. This happened in 1 225, and the important right which had been gained, was soon ap parent. For a long period, Scotland had impatiently submitted to the repeated visits and extortion of a papal legate, who, under the specious pretext of watch ing over the interests and reforming the abuses of the church, assembled councils, and levied immense sums of money in the country. On the meeting of the Scottish king and Henry the Third at York, Otho, a cardinal deacon, and at that time legate in England, took an opportunity to intimate his in tention of visiting Scotland, in order to enquire into the ecclesiastical concerns of the kingdom. \" I have never seen a legate in my dominions,\" replied Alex ander, \" and as long as I live, I will not permit such an innovation. We require no such visitation now, nor have we ever required it in times past.\" To this firm refusal the king added a hint, that should Otho venture to disregard it, and enter Scotland, he could not answer for his life, owing to the ferocious habits of his subjects, and the Italian prudently gave up all idea of the expedition.2 But the thirst for gold, and the good things of the land, was checked, not extin guished, in the breast of the papal emissary ; and after a few years, Otho again attempted to make his 1 Cart, of Moray, vol. i. p. 11.

Alexander met him while he was yet in England, and a violent remonstrance took place, which ended in the legate being permitted to hold a council at Edinburgh, under a positive stipu lation given under his seal, that this permission to enter the kingdom, should not be drawn into a pre cedent. The king, however, refused to countenance by his presence, what he affirmed to be an unneces sary innovation, and retired into the interior of his kingdom ; nor woidd he suffer the legate to extend his pastoral care or pecuniary exactions beyond the Forth.1 In Alexander the Third, who equalled his prede cessor in firmness, and surpassed him in sagacity, the church found a resolute patron and defender. A summons, by a papal legate, addressed to the clergy of Scotland, commanding them to attend his court at York, was pertinaciously resisted, as being an infringe ment of their ancient privileges ;* whilst an attempt to levy money upon the cathedrals and parish churches, and to enter the country, was opposed by the king, and in both instances the opposition was successful.3 But this was not all. The Scottish clergy openly disclaimed obedience to the canons for the regulation of the ecclesiastical affairs of the country, which were enacted in a council held by the papal legate in Eng land, and, aware of their own strength, assembled a provincial council at Perth, in which they promulga ted canons of their own, and boldly asserted their in- 1 Math.

In this manner, the opposition, which the firmness of the second Alexander begun, the cou rage and resolution of his successor completed ; and, before the conclusion of his reign, the independent rights of the Scottish church may be regarded as completely established. Whilst the Scottish monarchs and their clergy were thus amicably united in their resolutions to establish the independence of the church, the internal relations which united the civil and ecclesiastical authorities, and the good understanding subsisting between the crown and this great branch of the state, were little uninterrupted by those fierce contentions which dis turbed the repose of many other European kingdoms ; and the superior information and influence of the church was employed by our monarchs as a means of improving the savage habits of their people, and as a counterpoise to the exorbitant power of the great feudal nobles. It was amongst the clergy alone, that at this early period we find any thing like a progress in the arts and in literature, if indeed the learning of our country during this age deserves so high a name. In their profound disquisitions in scholastic theology, in an acquaintance with the ci vil and canon law, in the studies of alchemy and judicial astrology, and, in some rare instances, in a knowledge of the Oriental languages and the mathe matics, the clergy of Scotland were not far behind their brethren of Europe. There were a few indivi dual instances, in which the subtil, fervid, and inde fatigable mind, which, according to Galileo, marked the Scots at the era of the revival of letters, was to"], [383, "LEARNING OF THE CHURCH. 347 be seen amongst the Scottish scholars and philoso phers of this remote age.1 John Duns Scotus, a name which is now associated with feelings of unmerited ridicule, who was the founder of a school which ex tended its ramifications through every country in Europe ; for the encouragement of which, princes lavished their treasures, and the most noted univer sities were ready to devote their exclusive patronage, was undoubtedly a Scotsman, born in the Merse in the latter end of the reign of Alexander the Third. Unable to procure instruction in any of the higher branches of knowledge in his own country, he pur sued his studies at Oxford, and from this school of learning repaired to Paris, where he found an asylum at the time that the arms of Edward the First had gained a temporary triumph over the liberties of his native country. The labours of this indefatigable schoolman, shut up in twelve folios, once handled with reverential awe, enjoy undisturbed repose upon the shelves of many a conventual library ; yet his genius undoubtedly impressed itself strongly and last ingly upon his age, and the same mind, if fallen on better days, might have achieved less perishable tri umphs, and added to the stock of real knowledge.2 It has been already remarked, that in those dark days, in Scotland as well as in every other country in Europe, the whole stock of learning and science was shut up in the church ; and as the great body 1 This curious fact will be found mentioned in Sir R. Sibbald, Historia Literaria Gentis Scotorum, p. 30. MS. in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh. 1 Cave, Hist. Literaria, vol. ii. p. 3 of the Appendix."], [384, "348 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of the Scottish clergy received their education in the universities of Oxford or Paris, for as yet no great seminaries of learning had arisen in our own country, we must look for the intellectual acquire ments of this influential body in the nature of the studies which were then fashionable in the schools. That period of time which elapsed from the com mencement of the thirteenth to the beginning of the fourteenth century, has been distinguished in the his tory of human knowledge, by the title of the scho lastic age ; and a very slight view must convince us how wofully dark a picture it presents. It is marked by the rise of the second age of the scholastic the ology, in which the Aristotelian logic and metaphy sics were for the first time introduced into the demon strations of divine truth, and employed as an aid in the explanation of the Holy Scriptures. The compilation of voluminous and intricate sys tems of divinity which was introduced in the Greek church, as early as the eighth century, by John of Damascus, and in the Latin by the unfortunate Abe lard, seems to have suggested to Peter Lombard the idea of compiling what he termed his Four Books of the Sentences, which he extracted from the writings of the fathers, and more especially of St Augustine.1 This work acquired in a short time a very extensive repu tation, and its author, known by the name of the Mas ter of the Sentences, became the founder of the scho lastic theology ; but this great system continued for a 1 Ibid. vol. ii. p. 221.

In progress of time the error gained strength, and poisoning the sources of truth and knowledge, transformed the pure doctrines of the Scriptures, as they are found in the Bible, into an unmeaning rhapsody of words. Under both these ages of the scholastic theology, Scotland produced scholars whose reputation stood high in the schools. Richard, a prior of St Victor, at Paris, and Adam, a canon regular of the Order of Premonstratenses illu- minated the middle of the thirteenth century by very voluminous expositions upon the Prophecies, the Apo- calypse, and the Trinity, by treatises on the threefold nature of contemplation, and soliloquies on the com- position and essence of the soul ; while, during the second age of the scholastic theology, John Duns delivered lectures at Oxford to thirty thousand stu- dents.1 In the exact sciences, John Holybush, better known by his scholastic appellation, Joannes de Sa- crobosco, acquired during the thirteenth century a very high reputation, from his famous treatise up- on the sphere, as well as by various other mathe- matical and philosophical lucubrations ; and although claimed by three different countries, the arguments in favour of his being a Scotsman are not inferior to those asserted by England and Ireland. Like 1 Cave, Hist. Liter, vol. ii. p. 228. Ibid.

Another very extraordi nary person, who figured in those remote times, and over whose life and labours superstition has thrown her romantic and gloomy light, was Michael Scott, the astrologer of the Emperor Frederic the Second, and the great assistant of that monarch in his plan for restoring the works of Aristotle, through the me dium of translations from the Arabic, to the learned world of Europe. Previous to his reception at the Court of Frederic, Michael had studied at Oxford, and he afterwards visited France, Italy, and Spain, in the unwearied pursuit of such knowledge as the great universities of those countries afforded to the students of the thirteenth century. Mathematics, astronomy, and the sister art of astrology, were his favourite pursuits ; and in Spain, then partly in pos session of the Arabians, and assuredly at this time the most enlightened portion of Europe, he acquired that intimate acquaintance with the Arabic, which, in the general ignorance of the Greek language, was the only source from whence a knowledge of the Aristoleian philosophy could be derived. In obedience to the injunctions of the Emperor, Michael Scott com menced his labours ; and from the manuscripts which he has left, and which have reached our times, it is"], [387, "LEARNING OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY. 351 probable that he did not conclude them until he had translated and commented on the greater part of the works of the Stagyrite.1 From the plan of Frederic, however, or the versions of the Scottish philosopher, little real benefit could be derived to science, for the Arabians had themselves greatly cor rupted Aristotle ; and we need not wonder that translations from such sources, and made in ut ter ignorance of the language of the original, must have retarded rather than accelerated the progress of real knowledge.

The studies which formed the learning of the times were esteemed un worthy of the warlike and chivalrous spirit of the aristocracy, and universally abandoned to the church. Yet there is ample evidence in the Cartularies that Scotland, although possessed of no college or uni versity, had schools in the principal towns, which were under the superintendence of the clergy, and wherein the youthful candidates for ecclesiastical pre ferment were instructed in grammar and logic. We find, for example, in the Cartulary of Kelso, that the schools in Roxburgh were under the care of the monks of Kelso during the reign of David the First ; and that the rector of the schools of this ancient burgh was an established office in 1241. ! Perth and Stirling had their schools in 1173, of which the monks of Dunfermline were the directors ; and the same authentic records introduce us to similar seminaries in the towns of Ayr, South Berwick, and Aberdeen.2 It seems also probable that, within the rich and splendid monasteries and convents which, at this pe riod, were thickly scattered over Scotland, there were generally to be found schools, taught by the monks, 1 Cartulary of Kelso, pp. 1, 258, 343. 2.Sir L.

A remarkable instance of this is to be found in the Cartulary of Kelso, where Matilda, the Lady of Moll, in the year 1260, grants a certain rent to be paid to the abbot and the monks of this religious house, under the condition, that they should board and educate her son with the best boys who were intrusted to their care.3 In the Accounts of the Chamberlain of Scotland we find an entry of twenty shillings, that were given by Robert Bruce in 1329, to the support of the schools at Montrose ;3 and the same record recounts a charita ble donation of L.I 3, 6s. 8d. presented, by this mo narch, to Master Gilbert de Benachtyn, for his sup port in his studies.4 Yet the instances of eminent Scottish scholars which have been already noticed prove, very convincingly, that their own country could, at this period, afford them little else than the bare rudiments of education ; and the consequent resort of 1 Ant.

For such learning as then existed in the world, the monasteries afforded, in Scotland as in other countries, a sacred receptacle ; and although the character of the theology there taught was low and puerile, and the state of the other branches of hu man learning deformed by superstition and error, yet, without the feeble spark preserved in the religious houses, and the arts of life wrhich were there cul tivated and improved by the clergy, the state of the country, during the period of which we are now writing, would have been deplorable indeed. Much that we know of the authentic circumstances of the times we owe to the monkish annalists, who employ ed their leisure in the composition of those rude chronicles which, distant as they are from the model of a grave or enlightened history, often convey to us very striking pictures. In every monastery in Scot land it appears to have been the custom to compile three sorts of register books ; specimens of which ha ving been saved from the wreck of time, enable us to form a pretty correct idea of their nature and con tents. The first was a general register, compiled in the shape of a chronicle, or book of annals, containing the events arranged imder the years in which they hap pened. Such are the fragments entitled, \" Chronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum,\" the \" Chronicon Sanct\u00e6 Crucis,\" the \" Chronicle of Melross,\" the short"], [393, "LEARNING OF THE PERIOD. 357 fragment of the \" Chronicle of Holyrood,\" the \" Liber Pasletensis,\" and various other ancient \" chronica,\" which were written anterior to the fatal year 1291, when Edward collected and carried away the histori cal records of the country. The second species of monkish register was a bare obituaiy ; in which we find recorded the decease and the interment of the various abbots, priors, and bene factors of the monastery. And the third was the Cartulary, in which the charters of the kings, or other great men who favoured the religious house ; the bulls of the Popes ; the revenues of their lands ; the leases granted to their vassals or dependents ; the history and the proceedings of the various lawsuits in which they were engaged ; the taxes which they paid to the crown ; and many other minute and in teresting particulars, are recorded.1 The collection of these last is fortunately much more complete than we should have anticipated from the lamentable ha voc and destruction which occurred at the period of the reformation. Many of the original Cartularies are preserved in that noble repository of manuscripts which is the property of the Faculty of Advocates ; others have been discovered in the libraries of ancient families, or of private collectors ; and it is in this great storehouse of authentic records that there is to be found, although in a shape very barbarous and re pulsive to the general reader, the most fresh and living pictures of the manners of the times. 1 Nicholson's Scot. Hist. Library, p. 77."], [394, "358 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. This period, however, besides these monkish annal ists, produced one writer of original genius. I mean Barbour, the metrical historian of Bruce, of whose work it is difficult to say whether it ranks highest as a faithful history of this great monarch, and of the manners of his age, or a graphic and spirited poem, full of noble sentiment, and occasionally varied with beautiful descriptions of natural scenery. It is in every respect a very remarkable production for so early an age as the middle of the fourteenth cen tury, and contains many passages, which, in the strength and purity of the language, in the mea sured fulness of the rhythm, and the richness of the imagery, are not inferior to Chaucer.1 Its author was born about the year 1316, and after having received the rudiments of his education in his own country, pursued his higher studies at Oxford, and afterwards in France.2 On his return to his native country, he rose to a considerable preferment in the church, and devoted the leisure which he spared from the duties of his archdeanery, to the composition of his great national poem, for which he was rewarded by a pension from Robert the Second.3 Another work of this writer was a history or genealogy of the Kings of Scotland, compiled, in all probability, from Wace, or Geoffrey of Monmouth, and entitled the Brute. It is mentioned in Winton's Chronicle,4 but 1 Walton's Hist, of English Poetry, p. 318. 2 Jameson's Memoirs of the Life of Barbour, p. 6. 3 Ibid. p. 8. 4 Winton's Chronicle, book 3. c. 3. v. 139. vol. i. p. 54.

Winton himself, and his brother historian Fordun, both writers of great va lue, do not properly belong to this period. Considerably prior, in point of time, to Barbour, was the celebrated Thomas the Rhymer, or Thomas of Ercildoune, the author of the romance of Sir Tristrem, a poem which enjoyed the highest celebrity, not only in his own country and in England, but throughout Europe. It has been observed as a very remarkable circumstance, that while, prior to the period of Chaucer, there is to be found no English romance which is not a translation from some ear lier French original ; and at the time when the pro gress of the English language in the country which has given it its name was retarded by many power ful obstacles, the poets of the south of Scotland appear to have derived their romantic fictions from more original sources, and to have embodied them in a dialect of purer English, than the bards of the sister kingdom. In the romance of Sir Tristrem, writ ten about the middle of the thirteenth century,1 and in two other more ancient Scottish romances, Gawen and Gologras, and Goloran of Galloway, so very scanty are the traces of any thing like a French ori ginal, that, according to the conjecture of the great writer to whom we owe the publication of the first and most interesting of these early relics, it is pro bable they have been originally extracted from that 1 Introduction to the Romance of Sir Tristrem, by Sir Walter Scott, p. 12. Ibid. p. 54."], [396, "360 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. British mine of romantic fiction from which have proceeded those immortal legends of Arthur and his Knights, which took such a hold on the youthful imagination of Milton. The names of all the im portant personages in the story are of British ori gin ; and it is conjectured, upon data which it would be difficult to controvert, that in Tristrem himself, howrever transformed by the poetic colouring of Tho mas of Ercildoune, we are to recognise an actual Bri tish warrior, who, in the last struggles of the little kingdom of Cornwall against its Saxon invaders, sig nalized himself by those exploits which have given the ground-work to this poetic romance.1 In England, the Norman conquest, and the consequent prevalency of the Norman-French, which became the language of the court, and the medium in which all legal pro ceedings were carried on, necessarily corrupted the purity of the Saxon language. \" In England,\" to use the words of Sir Walter Scott in his Introduction to Sir Tristrem, \" it is now generally admitted, that after the Norman conquest, while the Saxon language was abandoned to the lowest of the people, and while their conquerors only deigned to employ their native French, the mixed language now called English ex isted only as a kind of lingua Franca, to conduct the necessary intercourse between the victors and the vanquished. It was not till the reign of Henry the Third that this dialect had assumed a shape fit for 1 Introduction to the Romance of Sir Tristrem, by Sir Walter Scott, pp. 52, 53."], [397, "LANGUAGE OF THE PERIOD. 361 the purposes of the poet ; and even then it is most probable that English poetry, if any such existed, was abandoned to the peasants and menials, while all who aspired above the vulgar, listened to the lais of Marie, the romances of Chrestien de Troyes, or the interesting fabliaux of the Anglo-Norman trouveurs. The only persons who ventured to use the native language of the country in literary compositions were certain monkish annalists, who usually think it ne cessary to inform us that they descended to so de grading a task out of pure charity, lowliness of spi rit, and love to the ' lewed men,' meaning the lower classes, who could not understand the Latin of the cloister, or the Anglo-Norman of the court.\" AVhilst such was the case in England, the forma tion of the language spoken in the sister country took place under very different circumstances ; so that, in stead of considering the language in which Thomas of Ercildoune and his successors have written as a daughter of the Anglo-Saxon, it would be more cor rect to regard it as an independent stream derived from the great fountain of the ancient Gothic, but coming to us in Scotland through purer channels than those wherein it flowed into England. Into the great controversy regarding the origin of the Pictish people it would be entirely out of place to enter at present ; although a careful examination of the original autho rities, upon both sides of a question which has been agitated with an asperity peculiarly inimical to the discovery of the truth, inclines me to consider them as a race of Gothic origin ; an opinion supported 7"], [398, "362 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by the united testimony of Bede, Nennius, Gildas, and the Saxon Chronicle.1 Every hypothesis which has been adopted to account for the introduction of the Saxon language into Scotland, from England, by the gradual influx of Saxon and Norman nobles, by the multitude of English captives taken in war, or by the marriage of Malcolm Canmore with a Saxon princess, seems extremely unsatisfactory ; and it ap pears a far more tenable theory to suppose, that in the great kingdom of Strathclyde, which came at last to be wrested from the original British tribes by the Saxons, in the large district of the Lothians and of Berwickshire, which was entirely peopled by Saxons, and in the extensive dominions of the Picts, a race of people descended from the same Gothic stem, there was formed, in the progress of centuries, a Gothic dialect which we may call the Scoto-Saxon, similar to the Anglo-Saxon in its essential character, but from the circumstances under which its formation took place, more unmixed with any foreign words or idioms. It was this Scoto-Saxon language, called by Robert de Brunne \" strange Inglis,\" or \" quaint Inglis,\"2 which appears to have been spoken by the Scots from the beginning of the twelfth century, and continued the language of the court and of the people down to the time of Barbour and Winton. It was in this language that the wandering minstrels of 1 Jamieson's Dissertation on the Origin of the Scottish Language, pp. 2, 4, 26. 2 Introduction to Sir Tristrem, p. 66."], [399, "LANGUAGE OF THE PERIOD. 363 those days composed their romantic legends of love or war ; and that the higher bards, who, to use the words of the ancient chronicler above quoted, wrote for \" pride and noblye,\" and to satisfy their thirst for fame, composed the romances which were then popular in Scotland, and came, through the medium of translations into Latin and Norman-French, to be famous throughout Europe.1 That the Gaelic was the language of the great body of the Celtic people, who at a very remote period overspread the greatest part of Scotland, and that it was understood and spo ken by Malcolm Canmore himself, is a fact resting on the most undoubted evidence ; but it is equally certain, that such is the radical difference in the cha racter and construction of these two tongues, that they have continued from the earliest period to the present day totally distinct, refusing to blend or amalgamate with each other. In like manner, the Norman-French, although understood by the Scottish monarchs and their nobility, and frequently employ ed in their diplomatic correspondence, seems never, as in England, to have usurped the place of the an cient national dialect of the Scoto-Saxon ; whilst the Latin, the language of science, of theology, of all civil and ecclesiastical contracts and legal proceedings, was solely understood by the monks and the clergy. It may be conjectured, therefore, ou pretty strong grounds, that the mass of the people, to the south of 1 Sir W7alter Scott's Introduction to the Romance of Sir Tris trem, pp. 74, 75, 76."], [400, "364 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the Firth of Tay, spoke the Scoto-Saxon, and that this \" quaint Inglis,\" as it is called by Robert de Brunne, was a purer stream from the Gothic fountain than the English spoken or written at the same period in the sister country. Of this language very few spe cimens have reached our times in a genuine and un corrupted state. The constant alterations which took place in early orthography, and in the gradual intro duction of new idioms, render it impossible to quote any fragment as a correct specimen of the language of the period, which is only preserved in a writer of a later age, and is not itself written at, or at least within, a very short time of its real date. Thus we cannot say for certain that the little song or monody which has already been quoted, composed on the death of Alexander the Third, as preserved by Win ton, is exactly in its genuine state, as the earliest manuscript of Winton, now extant, could not have been written prior to 1420 or 1421 ;! and in the long period of nearly a century and a half, a very great change must have taken place in the language. The manuscript of Thomas of Ercildoune's poem is, on the contrary, of great antiquity, and has been pro nounced by able antiquaries to belong to the middle of the fourteenth century ;2 but it appears to have been transcribed in England, and must consequently have undergone many changes from its original pu- 1 M'Pherson's Preface to Winton's Chronicle, p. 31. !

It still, however, contains many idioms which are at this day used in Scotland, although they have long ceased to be English, and its language exhibits, perhaps, the nearest approach to the genuine Scoto- Saxon which is to be found prior to the time of Bar bour and Winton. The description of Roland Ris, the father of the good Sir Tristrem, is as follows : \" He was gode and hende, Stalworth, wise, and wight ; Into this londes ende Y wot non better knight ; Trewer non to frende, And Rouland Ris he hight ; To batayl gan he wende ; Was wounded in that fight, Full felle : Blaunche Flower the bright The tale them herd she telle.\" ' The style of the poem is throughout exceedingly abrupt and elliptical ; and there is a concentration in the narrative, which, by crowding events into small room, produces an obscurity which renders it diffi cult to follow the story ; but there are some fine touches of nature ; and it is highly valuable for its pictures of ancient manners. There is every reason to believe, that many other romances, written in the ancient Scottish, or Scoto- Saxon, were composed at this period, and that their authors were in high estimation, encouraged by kingly 1 Sir Tristrem, p. 15."], [402, "366 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. patronage, and welcomed in the halls and castles of the feudal nobility. It unfortunately happened, that the art of printing was not yet discovered, so that the few written copies of such \" gests and ro mances,\" which must have thrown such rich and striking lights upon the genius and manners of our ancestors, have long ago perished. The simple names of the authors, or \" makars,\" with a brief and unsa tisfying notice of the subjects of their composition, are all that remain. Amongst these shadows we find a venerable poet commemorated by Winton, in his Chronicle, under the name of \" Hucheon of the Awle Ryall,\" or \" Hugh of the Royal Court,\" whose great work was entitled the \" Gest of Arthure.\" He appears, however, to have been a voluminous writer for those early days ; as, in addition to \" Arthure,\" he composed the \" Geste of the Brute,\" the \" Aventures of Sir Ga \u2022wyn,\" and the \" Pistil of Sweet Susan.\"1 Of these works, the last, a short poem, founded on the story of \" Susannah and the Elders,\" has reached our times. It is composed in a complicated alliterative stanza, in the use of which the bards of the \" north countree\" are re puted to have been especially skilful ; but it undoubt edly contains no passages which, in any degree, sup port the high character given of its author by Winton. \" It becomes all men,\" says this historian, \" to love Huchone ; who was cunning in literature, curious in his style, eloquent and subtile ; and who clothed his 1 Winton's Chronicle, vol. i. p. 121."], [403, "367 HUCHEONE OF THE AWT.E RYALL. composition in appropriate metre, so as always to raise delyte and pleasure.\" l If any reader, with the help of a glossary, will consent to labour through the \" Pistil of Sweet Susan,\" he will probably be disposed to come to the conclusion, either that it is not the identical com position of the bard of the \" Awle Ryall,\" or that his merits have been infinitely overrated by the partiality of Winton. His great historical romance, however, or \" Gest Historical,\" was, we may presume, a supe rior composition. In it he treated of subjects which were dear to the feelings and imaginations of our an cestors ; of the doughty deeds of Arthur, of his wor ship and prowess, his conquests and royal estate, his round table and twelve peers ; and it was, probably, in listening to these tales of love and war, that the ladies and knights of Winton's days experienced that \" plesans and delyte,\" which we in vain look for in the only composition of his which has reached our days. It has been asserted by Chalmers, that in Hucheon of the \" Awle Ryall\" we are to recognise Sir Hugh de Eglinton, whose death is lamented by Dunbar, in his pathetic \" Lament\" for the death of the Scottish poets who had preceded him ; but the grounds on which the opinion is founded appear ex ceedingly slight and superficial.2 1 Winton's Chronicle, vol. i. p. 122. 2 \" I think there cannot be any doubt, whether Sir Hugh de Eglynton were not Hucheon of the ' Awle Ryale.' \" Letter of Mr Chalmers to David Laing's Introduction to the Pystyl of Swete Susan It has been acutely observed by Dr Irving, in the third chapter of a Histoiy of Scottish Poetry, not yet published, but"], [404, "368 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Besides these higher poets of established excellence and fixed habitation, there can be no doubt that Scot land, from a very early period, produced multitudes of errant minstrels, who combined the characters of the bard and the musician, and wandering with their harp from castle to castle, sang to the assembled lords and dames those romantic ballads of love and war which formed the popular poetry of the day. It was impossible, indeed, that it should be otherwise. The Gothic tribes which, at a very early period, possessed themselves of the Lowlands ; the Saxons and Nor thumbrians who dwelt on the Border ; the Scan dinavians or Norwegians, who for several centuries maintained possession of the islands, and of Ross and Caithness ; and the Normans, whose original love for romantic fiction was cherished by their residence in France, were all passionately addicted to poetry. They possessed a wild imagination, and a dark and gloomy mythology ; they peopled the caves, the woods, the rivers, and the mountains, with spirits, elves, giants, and dragons ; and are we to wonder that the Scots, a nation in whose veins the blood of all those ancient races is unquestionably mingled, should, at a very re- which it is to be hoped he will not long withhold from the world, \" that when the author of Gowan and Gologras introduces the name of Hugh, he does not exhibit it in the form of Hucheon, but that both he and Winton exhibit it in the form of Hew.\" I have great pleasure in acknowledging the polite and liberal feeling with which Dr Irving communicated to me the three first chapters of his ma nuscript, and the assistance I have derived upon this, and many other occasions, from his learning and research."], [405, "369 MINSTRELS. mote period, have evinced an enthusiastic admiration for song and poetry, that the harper was to be found amongst the officers who composed the personal state of the sovereign, and that the country maintained a privileged race of wandering minstrels, who eagerly seized on the prevailing superstitions and romantic legends, and wove them in rude but sometimes very expressive versification into their stories and ballads ; who were welcome guests at the gate of every feudal castle, and fondly beloved by the great body of the people ? We learn from a curious passage in Giraldus Cambrensis, wdiich has been quoted by Sir Walter Scott in his introduction to Sir Tristrem, that the country situated beyond the Humber and the limits of York, in remote times undoubtedly a part of the kingdom of Scotland, acquired much fame for a pe culiar mode of singing in parts, which Giraldus de scribes with great minuteness, and in terms of high admiration. This ancient style appears to have been nothing more than a skilful combination of two voices, a base and a treble, \" una inferius submurmurante, altera vero superne demulcente pariter et delectante.\"1 In the reign of David the First, at the battle of the Standard, which was fought in 1138, minstrels, posture makers, and female dancers, accompanied the army ;2 and there can be little doubt that in Scot land, as in France and England, the profession of a minstrel combined the arts of music and recitation, 1 Sir Tristrem, Introduction, p. 70. 2 Ethelredus de Bello Standardi, p. 342. 2 A VOL. II."], [406, "370 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with a proficiency in the lower accomplishments of dancing and tumbling.1 In Giraldus Cambrensis, there is a remarkable testimony to the excellency of the Scottish music, during the reign of Henry the Second, who was contemporary with William the Lion. \" In Ireland,\" says he, \" they use for their de- light only two musical instruments, the harp and the tabor. In Scotland we find three, the harp, the ta- bor, and the horn. In Wales they have also three, the harp, the pipe, and the horn. The Irish employ strings made of brass wire, instead of the gut of ani- mals. It is the opinion of many at this day, that Scotland has not only equalled her mistress, Ireland, in musical skill, but has far excelled her, so that good judges are accustomed to consider that country as the fountainhead of the art.\"2 It seems to have been a custom in Scotland, as old at least as Alexander the Third, that when the sove reign made his progress through the country, minstrels and singers received him on his entrance into the towns, and accompanied him when he took his depart ure ; and we find Edward the First, in his triumphal journey through the land in 1296, paying certain sums of money as a remuneration for the same melodious reception.

At the coronation of David the Second, the minstrels again make their appearance ; and, from the higher sums which are then given, it may be conjectured that a more numerous band had attended upon this joyous occasion, than at the nuptials at Berwick. They are presented with twenty pounds by the king, and re ceive ten from his consort.2 There can be no doubt that, in many instances, these minstrels, besides be ing harpers or musicians, who sang and recited the popular poetry of the country, were themselves poets, who composed extemporaneous effusions, or, in more frequent instances, altered some well-known ditty of love or war to suit the taste, and, by a skilful change of name, to flatter the family pride, of the feudal baron in whose hall they experienced a wel come. It is difficult, unless we admit the existence of some such system of poetic economy, to account for the perpetual recurrence of the same individual stanzas, or at least of the same expressions, in many 1 Chamberlain's Accounts.

A single stanza of a Scottish ballad, composed after the defeat of the English at Bannockburn, has been preserved in the St Alban's Chronicle. \" For he,\" says the monkish author, speaking of Edward the Second, \" was dyscomfited at Banocksborne, there fore the maydens made a song thereof in that countree,. of Kynge Edward, and in this manere they songe ; \u2014 Maydens of Englonde, sore may ye mome, For ye have lost your lemmans at Banocksborne, With hevelogh ; What wenyth the kinge of Englonde To have got Scotland, With rombelogh.\" ' In Bower's additions to the Scotichronicon, written about 1441, he mentions, with a contempt which is ill concealed, that the vulgar crowd, in his own day, 1 St Alban's Chronicle, Part VII., sig. r. 11, quoted in Dr Jamie son's Notes on Bruce, p. 457.

Nor is it diffi cult to ascertain the cause why nearly every trace and relic of these ancient ballads has now perished. The \u25a0clergy of those remote days were the only men who committed any thing to writing, and it is certain that the clergy were the bitter enemies of the minstrels, whom they considered as satirical rivals and intruders, who carried off from the church the money which might have been devoted to more pious and worthy uses. They talk of them as profligate, low-bred buf foons, who blow up their cheeks, and contort their per sons, and play on horns, harps, trumpets, pipes, and Moorish flutes, for the pleasure of their lords, and who moreover flatter them by songs, and tales, and adulatory ballads, for which their masters are not ashamed to repay these ministers of the prince of darkness, with large sums of gold and silver, and with rich embroidered robes.2 1 Forduni Scotichronicon a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 104. s The proofs of this will be found in Ducange, voce Ministrelli.

From this natural antipathy of the clergy to the singers and minstrels, it has unfortunately happened that many a monkish Latin rhyme, composed in the miserable taste of the age, has been preserved with affectionate care, whilst the historic tales and ballads of this early period of our history have been consign ed to what was then deemed a just and merited obli vion. And yet a single ballad on the death of Wal lace, or the glory of Bruce, preserved as it then fell from the lips of a Scottish minstrel or a Scottish maiden, were now worth half the proud volumes of those pedantic schoolmen. It is extremely difficult to collect any authentic in formation upon the musical instruments, or the cha racter of the music, of this remote period. The only specimens of the musical instruments of the age, are to be found upon the rich stone carvings which ornament the pillars of the Gothic churches, and the tracery of the borders, windows, and gateways. Amongst these we meet with the figures of musicians, some of them so entire, as to give us a pretty correct idea of the shape at least of the instrument they hold in their hands. The flute with six holes, the bagpipe with a single drone, the viol with four strings, and the sounding holes above the bridge, and the lute, or at least an in strument approaching it in its shape, with six strings, are all discernible in the carvings of Melrose Abbey, and some of them appear in the beautiful specimen of the florid Gothic to be seen in Roslin Chapel.1 What 1 Statistical Account, vol. ix. p. 90. \" On the south-east of this church are a great many musicians, admirably cut, with much plea-"], [411, "MUSIC. 375 was the particular style and character of the music performed by these instruments, or of the songs which they accompanied, it is now impossible to determine ; and although the opinion of Ritson that none of our present Scottish melodies can be traced, upon any thing like authentic evidence, farther back than the Restoration, appears somewhat too sweeping and po sitive, it is nevertheless true, that, in the total want of authentic documents, it would be idle to hazard a conjecture upon the airs or melodies of Scotland at the remote period of which we now write. The church music, however, was in a different situation ; and, owing to the constant intercourse of the great body of our clergy with the Continent, the same style of sacred music which had been introduced into the religious service of Italy, France, and England, must have been imported into our own country. If we may believe Dempster, a writer of somewhat apo cryphal authority, Simon Taylor, a Scottish Domi nican friar, as early as the year 1230, became the great reformer of the church music of Scotland, and by his inimitable compositions brought this noble art to vie with the music of Rome itself. In 1250, when the body of St Margaret was re moved, with much ecclesiastic pomp, from the outer church, where she was originally interred, to the choir beside the high altar, the procession of priests and abbots, who carried the precious load upon their santness and gaiety in their countenances, accompanied with their various instruments.\" \u2014 Dalzel's Desultory Reflections on the State of Ancient Scotland, p. 56."], [412, "376 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. shoulders, moved along to the sounds of the organ, and the melodious songs of the choir, singing in parts.1 It has been asserted, indeed, by my late venerable grandfather, in his Dissertation on Scottish Music, that we owe the first introduction of organs, and of a choral service, into the cathedrals and abbeys of Scot land, to James the First ; but this can only be under stood as applicable to the improved organs of the days of James the Fourth,2 as we see there is certain evi dence of the instrument, in its first rude state, existing in Scotland at a much earlier period. It would have been singular indeed, if the same invention, which is found in England as early as the reign of Edgar, and in Ireland during the ninth century, should not have made its way into Scotland till the reign of James the First.3 Accordingly, in Fordun's account of the splen did nuptials of Alexander the Third, there is a mi nute description of a masque, which proves that in those days the Scottish musical instruments were not only of various sorts, but that some of those instru ments were similar to the organs used in the per formance of the tragedies, or mysteries, which were then frequently enacted by the clergy for the amuse ment and edification of the people.4 The wise partiality of our early kings to the manners and customs of Eng- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 83. *\u25a0* Dissertation on Scottish Music, by William Tytler, Esq. of WToodhouselee.

Ethelred, an author of high au thority, and a friend and contemporary of David the First, gives us the following minute and curious ac count of the church music in his own days : \u2014 \" Since all types and figures are now ceased, why so many organs and cymbals in our churches ?

Next they lay down their manly vi gour, and with their voices endeavour to imitate the softness of women. Then, by an artificial circumvo lution, they have a variety of outrunnings. Some times you shall see them with open mouths and their breath restrained, as if they were expiring and not singing, and by a ridiculous interruption of their breath, they appear as if they were altogether silent.

And this ridiculous behaviour is called reli gion. And when these things are most frequently done, then God is said to be most honourably wor shipped.\"1 From this state of complicated perfec tion to which the religious music of England had arrived at so early a period, we may be permitted to attribute a considerable knowledge, if not an equal excellence, in the same science to our own country ; for we know that the Scottish clergy, in the cultiva tion of the arts which added solemnity and magni ficence to their system of religious worship, were, in few respects, behind their brethren of the South. Yet this is certainly conjectural, and not founded upon accurate historic proof. The churchmen of those remote times did not only monopolize all the learning which then existed. They were the great masters in the necessary and orna mental arts ; not only the historians and the poets, but the painters, the sculptors, the mechanics, and even the jewellers, goldsmiths, and lapidaries of the times. In a particular manner, from their proficiency in mathematical and mechanical philosophy, they were the principal architects of the age ; and the royal and baronial castles, with the cathedrals, mo- 1 Aelred, Speculum Caritatis, b. ii. c. 20.

Into the numerous and elegant arts then practised by the clergy it is impossible to enter ; but no apology will be required for submitting a few remarks upon the last-mentioned subject, the domestic and the re ligious architecture of the times ; as the question, In what sort of houses or fortalices were our ancestors accustomed to live ? is not one of the least interesting which presents itself in an enquiry into the ancient condition of the country. At a very remote era, the fortifications in the Low land counties of Scotland, inhabited by tribes of Go thic origin, were, in all probability, the same as the castles called Anglo-Saxon in England. Their con struction partook of the rude simplicity of the times in which they were built. They consisted of an in ner keep, or castle, surrounded by a strong wall, be yond which was a ditch, or deep fosse, sometimes twenty or thirty yards in breadth ; and beyond this again was raised an outer vallum or rampart, of no great height, and apparently composed alone of earth.1 1 Strutt's Manners and Customs of the Inhabitants of England, vol. i. p. 25. \" The ground-work of another of these Saxon castles is yet remaining at Witham, being between the church and the town ; the form and size of it are yet very visible. This castle was likewise built by Edward the Elder, who resided at the castle of Maldon while this was completing, which was about the year 912 or 914. The middle circle contains the keep or castle, and is about 160 yards in diameter, and 486 yards round ; the ditch is, in its present state, 260 feet in breadth, and beyond the ditch is the ex ternal vallum, which is yet in a very perfect condition, full four feet"], [416, "380 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. They were generally placed on the brow of a steep hill, on a neck of land running into a river, or some such situation of natural strength ; and, as the art of war, and the attack of fortified places, had made then but little progress, the security they conferred was equal to the exigences of the times. In the earliest age of Saxon architecture, or at times when a temporary fortification was speedily re quired, it was common to build the walls round the castles of strong wooden beams. We learn, for in stance, from the Scala Chronicle, that \" Ida caused the castle of Bamborow to be walled with stone, that afore was but inclosed with woode;\"1 and the castle of Old Bale, in Yorkshire, is described by Camden as being, at first, fortified with thick planks of wood, eighteen feet in length, and afterwards en circled with a wall of stone. These stone walls were constructed in a singular manner. They were faced, both without and within, with large square blocks ; and the space between the facings was filled with a deposit of small rough flint stones or pebbles, mixed up with a strong cement of liquid quick-lime.2 In the progress of years, the Saxons made great improvement in the art of building ; and, in point of strength and security, their castles were capable of high, and 18 or 20 feet in breadth, the circumference of the whole being about 1 000 yards.\" 1 Lelaud's Collectanea, vol. i. p. 514. 2 Will.

Owing, however, to the remote era in which the Scoto-Norman castles were built, time, and in some instances the tasteless and relentless hand of man, have, in our own country, committed great ravages. The necessary policy, too, of Bruce, who dismantled and destroyed most of the castles which he took, has been fatal to the future researches of the antiquary and the historian ; and few frag ments of those ancient strengths remain, which can, on satisfactory grounds, be pronounced older than the reign of this monarch. Yet the records of the Chamberlain's Accounts, and the incidental notices of our early historians, furnish us with ample evidence that, in the building of castles and fortalices, and in the erection of those magnificent churches of which little but the ruins remain, Scotland had made great progress during the thirteenth century. We have already seen the effectual precautions against attack which were taken by Alexander the Third, when it became certain that Haco, the King of Norway, had determined to invade his kingdom. The castles on the coast of Scotland were carefully inspected ; and from the details regarding their re pairs, which are to be found in the few extracts that"], [418, "382 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. remain of the Chamberlain's Accounts under this mo narch, some interesting information may be gathered. The northern coast of Scotland was defended by a series or chain of strong castles of stone, fortified by towers and draw-bridges, and containing a dungeon, provided with iron fetters for the prisoners, accom modation for the stores and warlike engines, guard rooms for the garrison, and a great hall or state apartment where the baron or chastelain resided and entertained his vassals. The situation of these cas tles was generally chosen with great skill. If on the coast, advantage was taken of the vicinity of the sea ; if in the interior, of some river or hill, or insulated rock, which rendered the approach on one side ex ceedingly arduous and difficult, while care was taken to fortify the remaining sides by a deep fosse, and strong walls, with towers at each angle. Caerlaverock, a strong castle of the Maxwells, is thus described by an eye-witness in the year 1300, when it was besieged and taken by Edward the First : \" Its shape was like that of a shield, for it had only three sides all round, with a tower on each angle ; but one of the towers was a double one, so high, so long, and so large, that under it was the gate with the draw-bridge, well made and strong, and a sufficiency of other defences. It had good walls and good ditches, filled to the edge with water ; and I believe there never was seen a castle more beautifully situated, for at once could be seen the Irish sea towards the west, and to the north a fine country, surrounded by an arm of the sea, so that no living man could approach it on two sides"], [419, "383 ANCIENT CASTLES. without putting himself in danger of the sea. To wards the south the attack was not easy, because there were numerous dangerous defiles of wood and marshes ; besides ditches where the sea is on each side, and where the river makes a reach round, so that it was necessary for the host to approach it to wards the east where the hill slopes.\" 1 This minute description of Caerlaverock may, with very slight alterations, introduced by the nature of the ground, or suggested by the fancy and ingenuity of the archi tect, be applied to most of the Scottish castles of the period. Two principles were to be followed out in their construction. They were to be fitted in the first place, for strength and resistance ; whilst, according to the rank of the feudal baron, provision was to be made for his being comfortably or splendidly accom modated ; and although the first requisite was inva riably made to regulate and control the second, yet it is impossible not to admire the skill and ingenuity with which the genius of those ancient architects con trived to combine the two. The earliest specimens of the strong Anglo-Norman castle present us with a single square tower ; and it is evident that the low est story of the castle, being most exposed to attack, was required to be formed in the strongest man ner. We find, accordingly, that the walls in this part of the building which formed the chambers where the stores were kept, and the dungeons for the pri- 1 Siege of Caerlaverock. Edited, with Notes, by Mr Nicholas., pp. 61, 62."], [420, "384 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. soners, were invariably the strongest and thickest part of the building. These lower apartments were not lighted by windows, but by small loop-holes in the solid stone, so ingeniously constructed, that it was nearly impossible from without to discharge into them any arrow or missile, so as to injure the sol diers within. The wall itself, which was here about twelve feet thick, was built in the same way as those of the Saxon castles, being cased within and without with strong large square blocks of hewn stone, and filled up in the middle with flints embed ded in fluid mortar ; and we know that the same mode of building was employed in both countries, not only by an examination of the Scoto-Norman castles which remain, but by the evidence of the en tries in the Chamberlain Accounts.1 The entrance or principal door leading into the castle, was not in the lower story, but, for the purpose of security, gene rally placed pretty far up the wall, and communica ting by a draw-bridge,2 with a flight of steps or stair case of strong masonry. The door itself was not only secured by a strong gate of thick oak, with iron knobs, but by a portcullis or grating composed, some- 1 Thus in the Chamberlain Accounts, Temp. Alex.

On the second floor were the apartments where the soldiers of the garrison had their residence and lodging, and which, as it was much exposed to attack, had generally no windows at all in the front wall. The rooms were lighted by loop-holes in the three remaining sides, which, surrounded by the strong wall enclosing the ballium or outer court of the castle, were more secure from the missiles of the enemy. The third floor con tained the apartments of state, the hall of the castle where the baron lodged his friends and feasted his vassals. It was lighted by Gothic windows, highly ornamented, and was commonly hung with arras or rich tapestry, and adorned by a roof of carved oak. At each end of the apartment was a large recess in the wall, forming an arched fire-place, highly orna mented with rich carving, and frequently formed so 1 Mr King's Observations on Ancient Castles, published in the Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. iv. p. 364, containing a most acute and ingenious examination of this interesting subject.

One of the finest specimens of the ancient feudal hall is still to be seen at Darnaway, which was the seat of the great Randolph. Its roof is supported by diagonal rafters of massive oak ; its height must ori- ginally have been above thirty feet, and its remaining proportions are eighty-nine feet in length, by thirty- five in breadth. At one end is a music gallery ; and in the middle of this magnificent apartment still stands the baron's board or table, supported on six pillars of oak, curiously bordered and indented with Gothic carving. His ancient oaken chair, in form not unlike the coronation chair at Westminster, and carved with his arms and the insignia of his office,1 is still seen ; and although this description of Randolph's hall is not to be understood as applicable to the state apartment of all, or even of most, of our feudal castles ; yet, ma- king allowance for the difference in the proportions, the plan and disposition of the room is the same in all, and was singularly well adapted for that style of rude and abundant hospitality, when every man, who followed the banner of his lord, found a seat at his table, and every soldier who owned a jack and a spear, might have a place at his hearth. The uppermost story in the castle was composed of rooms of smaller dimensions, which were lighted by windows of consi- 1 Statist. Ace. vol. xx. p. 224."], [423, "ANCIENT CASTLES. 387 derable size ; and in this highest floor, as from the great height there was little precautions to be taken against attack, the architect was at liberty to indulge his fancy in ornamenting the windows and the battle ments ; so that it is not unfrequent, in the most an cient feudal castles, to find the windows in the floor next the roof of the largest dimensions, and with the richest carving of any in the building. It was in these highest rooms, that, during a siege, the cata pults, balist\u00e6, war-wolfs, and other instruments of annoyance and destruction, were placed ; and there wras a communication between this highest story and the roof, through which they could be drawn up up on the leads of the castle as the exigences of the siege required. Such was the general construction and disposition of the feudal castles of those remote times ; and any one fond of antiquities, and interested in the history of the country, may, in the course of a short tour in Scotland, convince himself of the truth of the descrip tion. Some, of course, were of larger dimensions, and covered a much greater extent of ground than others ; and according to the required strength and importance of the station, and the nature of the ground, to many was added an outer or base court, surrounded by walls and flanking towers. Besides this, the castle itself was commonly encircled by a strong outer wall, commu nicating with a tower, the interior of which formed a kind of vestibule to the principal entrance of the castle ; whilst, beyond the wall, was a broad breast work or barbican, and a moat, which encircled the"], [424, "388 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. whole building. In 1325, Bruce had commanded the castle of Tarbart to be inspected and repaired ; and a very minute account of the expense laid out in increa sing the breadth of the walls, building a new tower, and fortifying the approach by a fosse, is to be found in the Chamberlain Accounts. The repairs appear to have occupied seven months ; and, during this pe riod, there was a consumption of seven hundred and sixty chalders of burnt lime, the expense of the whole work being four hundred and thirty pounds, ten shil lings, and fivepence.1 Besides these stone buildings, adapted principally for strength and defence, it was extremely common to construct halls and other apartments of wood, within the outer court, and even to build castles and fortifications entirely of that perishable material. In the hall, the wooden frame-work, composed of strong beams of oak, was covered with a planking of fir, and this again laid over with plaster, which was adorned with painting and gilding,2 whilst the large oak pillars supporting the building rested in an em- 1 The items of the accounts will be found printed in the Appen dix.

When the Earl of Athole was assassinated by the Bissets at the tour nament at Haddington, in the early part of the reign of Alexander the Third, the hospitium in which he slept and was murdered, seems to have been a wooden building ; and after the deed, the perpetrators burnt it, and a manour and palace connected with it, to the ground.1 There is a curious passage quoted by Camden, which, in describing the siege of Bedford Castle, during the reign of Henry the Third, throws considerable light on the disposition of these ancient buildings ; and as the account is -written by an eye-witness of the siege, the information is valuable and authentic. \" On the east side was one petrary and two mangonells daily playing upon the tower, and on the west were two mangonells battering the old tower ; as also one on the south, and another on the north part, which beat down two passages through the walls that were next them. Besides these, there were two machines constructed of wood so as to be higher than the cas tle, and erected on purpose for the slingers and watch men ; they had also several machines where the slingers and cross-bowmen lay in wait ; and another machine called cattus, under which the diggers that were employed to undermine the castle, came in and went out. The castle was carried by four assaults. In the first was taken the barbican ; in the second they got full possession of the outer ballia ; at the 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 72."], [426, "390 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. third attack, the wall by the old tower was thrown down by the miners, from which, by a vigorous at tack, they possessed themselves of the inner ballia through a breach. At the fourth assault, the miners set fire to the chief tower on the keep, so that the smoke burst out, and the tower itself was cloven to that degree as to show visibly some broad rents, where upon the enemy surrendered.\"1 In the various sieges which occurred in Scotland during the war of liberty, the same mode of attack was invariably adopted, by mining and battering the walls, and wheeling up to them immense covered machines, divided into different stages, from which the archers and cross-bowmen attacked the soldiers on the battlements of the castle. With regard to the houses within burgh, which were inhabited by the wealthy merchants and arti sans, and to the granges and cottages which formed the residence of the free farmers, the liberi firmarii, and of the unfortunate class of bondmen or villeyns, they appear to have been invariably built of wood. In the year 1243, eight of the richest burghs in Scot land were consumed by fire, and reduced to ashes ;2 and in the Chamberlain's Accounts, we constantly meet, amongst the items of royal expenditure, with the sums paid to the carpenter, and the moneys laid out in the purchase of wood, for the construction of 1 Camden, in Bedfordshire, p. 287, quoted in Strutt's Manners and Customs, vol. i. pp. 94, 95. 2 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 75."], [427, "GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 391 new granges, sheds, and cottages, upon the various manors possessed by the king. In 1228, Thomas de Thirlestane, one of those Lowland barons who had made his way into Moray, was attacked and slain in his stronghold, by Gillescop, a Celtic chief, who af terwards destroyed several wooden castles in the same country, and consumed by fire a great part of In verness ;J and we know that the practice of building of wood the houses within burgh continued to a very late period, both in England and Scotland. We ge nerally connect the ideas of poverty, privation, and discomfort, with a mansion constructed of such a ma terial ; but the idea is a modern error. At this day the mansion which Bernadotte occupied as his palace when he was crowned at Drontheim, a building of noble proportions, and containing very splendid apart ments, is wholly built of wood, like all the houses in Norway; and from the opulence of the Scottish burgh ers and merchants during the reigns of Alexander the Third and David the Second, there seems good rea son to believe, that their mansions were not destitute either of the comforts, or what were then termed the elegances, of life. I come now to say a few words upon the third, and by far the noblest class of buildings, which were to be seen in Scotland during this remote period, \u2014 the monasteries, cathedrals, and religious houses. Few who have seen them will not confess that, in the grandeur of their plan, and the extraordinary skill 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 57, 58."], [428, "392 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and genius shown in their execution, they are enti tled to the highest praise ; and if we read the de scription given, in a monkish chronicle in the Bri tish Museum, of the earliest church at Glastonbury,1 composed of wooden beams and twisted rods, and turn from this to the cathedral of St Magnus in Orkney, to the noble pile at Dunfermline, to the more light and beautiful remains of Melrose Abbey, or to the still more exquisite examples of the Go thic architecture in England ; the strength of ori ginal genius in the creation of a new order of archi tecture, and the progress of mechanical knowledge in mastering the complicated details of its execution, are very remarkable. There cannot be the least doubt, that we owe the perfection of this noble style to the monks ; and although the exact era of its first ap pearance, either in England or in our own country, is difficult to be ascertained with precision ; yet there are some valuable and interesting notices in our ear ly historians, which make it very probable that our first masters in the art of building churches in stone were the Italians. It may have happened that, when they had once acquired a degree of skill in the ma nagement of their materials, some of those master minds which appear in the darkest times, struck out the idea of imitating in stone the wooden edifices of the time ; and when working from models of twisted willow rods, the pliable material of which the walls and ornaments of our most ancient religious houses were 1 Cotton MS. tib.

Indeed, when the idea was once seized, and it was found that the limited knowledge of working in stone, and of the mechanical powers which the age possessed, was yet sufficient to reduce it to practice, we can easily conceive that its future progress towards perfection may have been tolerably easy and rapid. \u2022 The infinity of beautiful Gothic forms which are capable of being wrought, and which almost necessarily suggest themselves to an artist working in willow, and the admirable skill in car ving and imitating in stone which was acquired by the monkish artists at a very early period, produced an action and re-action on each other ; and the same writer already mentioned has shown, by a careful ana lysis of every portion of a Gothic church, that there is not a single ornament in its structure and compo sition which does not serve to corroborate this idea. As to our earliest Norman builders being instructed by the Italians, there is historical evidence. In the year 1174, the cathedral church at Canterbury was destroyed by fire ; and in a description by Edmer, a contemporary writer, it is expressly stated, that this ancient edifice was built by the assistance of Roman 1 Simeon Dunelm. p. 27. 2 Sir James Hall's Essay on the Origin, History, and Principles of Gothic Architecture."], [430, "394 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. artists, after the model of the church of St Peter's at Rome.1 That the most ancient churches in Britain were constructed of pillars and a frame-work of oak, co vered writh reeds, or twisted rods, we know from the most authentic evidence ; and it is asserted by Gervas, in his account of the rebuilding of the church of Canterbury, after its destruction by fire, that, whereas in the ancient structure the roof had been composed of wood, and decorated with exquisite painting, in the new church it was constructed of an arch, built of stone, and light tufle-work.2 Nay, even the name of the adventurous artist w7ho first seems to have conceived the bold idea of working the rib bed and vaulted ceiling in stone, in the same way in which it had formerly been executed in wood, has been preserved to us ; it was William of Sens, a French artist. He invented, also, as we learn from the monkish historian who was an eye-writness of his labours, most ingenious machines for the loading and unloading the ships 'which brought the stones from foreign parts, in all probability from Normandy, as well as for raising aloft the immense weights of lime and of stone which were required in the building; he furnished the stone-cutters with working planes, or models, which guided them in their nice and difficult operations ; and he began to work the ribbed arches and vaidted panels upon a frame-work of timber, to 1 Chronica Gervasii, Pars Prima, de Combustione et Reparatione Durobornenis Ecclesiae. : Gervasii Chronica, p. 1298."], [431, "395 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. which was attached the scaffolding where the masons stood. As the work proceeded, this scaffolding un fortunately gave way, and the adventurous artist was incurably maimed ; but he had struck out the idea, and it was more successfully carried into execution by an English architect, who succeeded him.1 It is the opinion of the acute writer who has pointed out this first and most important step in the progress of our ecclesiastical architecture, that the idea of ornament ing the great pillars with groups of smaller columns surrounding them, was introduced at the same pe riod, and by the same artist.2 The art of executing very large and magnificent buildings in timber frame-work, was carried to high perfection in the northern countries of Europe during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries. It had made great progress in England, and was there known and practised in the building of churches, un der the name of the Teutonic style. Owing, how ever, to the perishable nature of the materials, and to accidents by fire, these churches were frequently either destroyed, or reduced to a state of extreme de cay ; so that the ruinous state of the ecclesiastical edi fices in the northern parts of Europe, became a se rious subject of enquiry at Rome about the com mencement of the thirteenth century, and measures were taken to obviate the grievance. These measures were of a very singular nature. The Pope created 1 See Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. ix. p. 115.

To the various north ern countries where the churches had fallen into a state of decay were these artists deputed ; and as the first appearances of the Gothic architecture in Europe was nearly coincident with this mission of Roman artists, and, as has already been observed, the new style of imitating the arched frame-work of wood by ribbed arches of stone was known by the name of the Roman style, there arises a presump tion that we owe this magnificent style of architect ure t\u00a9 these travelling corporations of artists, who, in consequence of the exclusive privileges which they enjoyed, assumed to themselves the name of Free Masons, and under this title became famous throughout Europe.1 These same corporations, from their first origin, possessed the power of taking ap prentices, and admitting into their body such masons as they approved of in the countries where their works were carried on ; so that, although the style may have originated amongst Italian artists, it is per fectly possible it may have been brought to perfec tion by other masters, who were natives of the dif ferent countries to which these Roman workmen were sent ; and this will account for the fact, that the 1 Sir James Hall's Essay on Gothic Architecture, pp. 109, 114."], [433, "GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 397 church at Canterbury, in which the ribbed arch of stone is supposed to have been introduced, for the first time, into England, was originally the work of a Norman, and afterwards completed by an English architect. In speaking of these corporations of architects of the middle ages, Sir Christopher Wren has given, in his Parentalia, the following account of their con stitution : \" The Italians, with some Greek refugees, and with them French, Germans, and Flemings, join ed into a fraternity of architects, procuring Papal bulls for their encouragement, and particular privi leges ; they styled themselves Free Masons, and ranged from one nation to another as they found churches to be built, for very many, in those ages, were everywhere in building, through piety or emu lation. Their government was regular ; and where they fixed near the building in hand, they made a camp of huts. A surveyor governed in chief ; every tenth man was called a warden, and overlooked each nine ; and the gentlemen of the neighbourhood, either out of charity, or commutation of penance, gave the materials and the carriages. Those,\" adds Sir Chris topher, \" who have seen the accounts, in records, of the charge of the fabrics of some of our cathedrals, near four hundred years old, cannot but have a great esteem for their economy, and admire how soon they erected such lofty structures.\"1 1 Parentalia, pp. 306, 307.

Besides fourteen bishops' sees, to most of which was attached a Gothic cathedral and palace, there existed, at the time of the Reformation, a hundred and seventy-eight religious houses, consisting of abbacies, priories, convents, and monasteries, most of which were very richly endowed, situated in the midst of noble woods, surrounded by spacious gardens, parks, and orchards, and exhibit ing, in the style of their architecture, specimens of the progressive improvement of the art, from the sim ple and massy Saxon, to the most florid Gothic.

SPORTS AND AMUSEMENTS. In an enquiry in which I have attempted to give something like a civil history of the country, the sports and amusements of our ancestors form a sub ject of interesting research ; although here, as on al most all other similar points, we have to lament the extreme scarcity of authentic materials. The chival rous amusements of Scotland appear to have been the same as in the other feudal countries of Europe. Hunting and hawking, the tourney or play at arms, the reading of romances, the game of chess, masques and feasts, minstrelsy and juggler's tricks, with the licensed wit of the fool, filled up the intervals of lei sure which were spared from public or private war. With regard to hunting, the immense forests with which, as we have already seen, our country was covered during this period, gave every facility for the cultivation of this noble pastime ; and there is ample evidence, that, at a very early period, the chase formed one of the principal recreations of the kings and the barons of Scotland. David the First recounted to Ethelred, Abbot of Rievaux, an anecdote regarding"], [436, "400 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Malcolm Canmore his father, which illustrates this in a minute and striking manner. Malcolm had received private information that a plot against his life was laid by one of his corn-tiers in whom he placed great confidence. The king took no notice of the discovery, but calmly awaited the arrival of the traitor with his vassals and followers at court ; and when they came, gave orders for his huntsmen and hounds to prepare for the chase, and be waiting for him on the first dawn of the morning. \" And now,\" says Ethelred, \" when Aurora had driven away the night, King Malcolm assembled his chief officers and nobles, with whom he proceeded to take the pastime of the chase in a green plain, which wTas thickly surrounded by a wood. In the middle of this forest was a gentle emi nence, profusely covered with wild flowers, in which the hunters, after the fatigues of the chase, were ac customed to repose and solace themselves. Upon this eminence the king stood ; and, according to that law or custom of the chase, which the vulgar call the trysta, having allotted certain stations to the different nobles and their dogs, in such a manner that the game should meet death wherever it attempted to make its escape, he dismissed them, but requested the traitor to remain alone wTith him, whilst the rest de parted. When this was done, the king took him aside to a more remote part of the wrood, and drawing his sword, informed him that he knew well the whole of his treachery. ' We are alone,' said he, ' and on an equal footing, as becomes brave men ; both are 10"], [437, "HUNTING. 401 armed, both are mounted; neither of us can receive as sistance. You have sought my life : take it, if you are able.\"1 It is hardly necessary to add, that this heroic conduct of the king was followed by the immediate contrition and pardon of his heart-struck vassal. The use of the term trysta in this passage, enables us to throw some additional light upon the ancient customs of the chase in Scotland. The law of trysta, which Ethelred here alludes to, was one by which the king's vassals, when he took the pastime of the chase, were bound to attend the royal rendezvous at the ground appointed, with a certain number of hounds ; and the phrase yet used in Scotland, to \" keep tryst,\" seems to be derived from this ancient practice in wood-craft.2 In the Highlands at this day, the mode of hunting by a tenkle is very similar to the trista held upon this occasion by Malcolm Canmore. David the First ap pears to have been no less fond of hunting than his father Malcolm. Indeed, we may believe that his intimate connexion with England, previous to his coming to the throne, must have given him an addi tional love for an amusement which the Normans then followed with an enthusiasm which transformed it from a recreation into a science. Accordingly, 1 Ethelredus de Genealogia Regum Anglorum, p. 367. Inter x Scriptores Twysden, vol. i. 2 Ducange, voce Trista, who quotes Coke, part iv. Institut. p. 306. In a Charter of Edward III.

The hero is the very king of hunters, and his profound acquaintance with the mystery of wood-craft is dwelt upon with a fond minuteness, which proves how high was the place which the science occupied in what were then considered the accomplishments of a brave and gentle knight. Tris- trem, in travelling through a forest, encounters a company of huntsmen, who are returning from the chase with their hounds in leash, and the game which they had slain. He is scandalized at the awkward and unsportsmanlike manner in which they had broke up the venison ; and on upbraiding them for their want of science, an unflayed hart is thrown down before him, and he is courteously requested to give 1 Compotum Patricii de Graham Vicecomitis de Strivelin.

This he performs in a manner so masterly and admirable, that the huntsmen are in ecstasies ; and this new and superior mode of carving the buck is communicated to the king of the country, who esteems himself fortunate in having lived at an era when knowledge was destined to make so impor tant a step towards perfection.1 From the whole ad venture, it is evident, that to break up a stag, or, in the language of Sir Tristrem, to \" dight the erber,\" according to the most scientific method ; to give his rights to the forester, the nombles to the hunters and spectators, the quarre to the hounds, and the expected corbin bone to the raven ; to allot the due portion to himself as carver ; to tie up the paunch with the grease ; to preserve the gurgiloun ; and, lastly, to recite the appropriate rhyme, and blow the tokening or death-note, were considered matters of deep study and of no very easy attainment, which in those early ages formed a material part of a chivalrous and noble education, and which, it must be observed, constitu ted only a small portion of the complicated science of wood-craft. It is evident that Robert Bruce, who seems to have been accounted one of the most accom plished knights of his time, was an adept in the mys teries of the chase. He winds his horn in so mas terly a way, that Sir James Douglas instantly pro nounces that blast to be none but the king's ; and the strength with which he draws the bow, and the un- 1 Romance of Sir Tristrem, pp. 31, 32, 33.

Indeed, for many months, when he led the life of a proscribed and wandering fugitive, he and his followers were driven to support themselves by the chase ; 1 and there is evidence in the Chamberlain's Accounts, that his dogs, his falcons, his horses, and his huntsmen, were after wards subjects of considerable care and expense.2 At a very remote period, indeed, we find that the Scottish stag-hounds and wolf-dogs were exceedingly prized in foreign countries ;3 and, under the reign of David the Second, the character of the Scottish dogs and falcons stood so high, that they became an article of export ;4 while in the charters of the island lords, the eyries of falcons are particularly mentioned.5 The hawks of Norway, however, for strength and flight, were the most famous in the world ; and there is a curious early notice in Sir Tristrem, which shows that the Norwegian merchant-ships imported them into Scotland. 1 Barbour, pp. 40, 55, 80, 107. 2 \" Gilisio Venatori ex dona dni regis p. lram. ]3sh. 4d.\" Com potum Constab. de Cardross, p. 39.

It is easy, in deed, if we carry our mind back to the thirteenth or fourteenth century, to imagine how imposing and delightful must have been those field sports of our ancestors.

At last, these gentle dames descend from their bower, and each, assisted by her favourite knight, \"lightly springs to selle ;\" the aged baron him self is gravely mounted, and leads the way ; and the court of the castle rings with hoof and horn as the brilliant and joyous cavalcade cross the drawbridge, anddisperse themselves through the good green-wood. There are few who could resist a wish to join in the pastime. Within doors, and when not occupied by war or the chase, we are apt to believe that the time must have passed somewhat heavily with our ancestors. Yet here, too, they had their resources. In the first place, their solemn feasts and banquetings were on a great scale, occupied much of their attention, and were not speedily concluded, if we may form an opinion from the variety and quantity of the viands. All great occasions of festivity or solemnity, such as baptisms and marriages, the installation of bi shops, or other dignified churchmen, the recurrence of Christmas and the new year, the birthday of the king or the prince, it was the custom of those ancient times to commemorate by feasts and banqueting ; and the Chamberlain's Accounts of our early monarchs afford ample evidence of the scale upon which these enter tainments were conducted. Immense quantities of beef and mutton, of pork and poultry; large and constant supplies of salmon, herring, hard-fish and white fish, besides sturgeons, lampreys, eels in great"], [445, "RANQUETS. 409 abundance ; large importations of white and red wine, with a great variety of spiceries and sweetmeats, besides figs, raisins, oil of olives, gingerbread, wax, vinegar, verjuice, and porpoises, form the anoma lous and multifarious articles which swell the ac count of William de Buthirgask, clerk of the kitchen to the good King Robert.1 These were the articles of usual and daily consumption ; but on occasions of solemn banquetings and unusual festivity, the enter tainments were in the last degree extravagant and expensive. At the feast given at Canterbury, on the installation of Ralph, Abbot of St Augustine, six thousand guests sat down to a dinner of three thou sand dishes ;2 and this was far exceeded by the splen dour of the marriage banquet, when the Earl of Corn wall espoused Cincia, the daughter of the Count of Provence, upon which occasion thirty thousand dishes were served up to an immense assemblage of guests, who had arrived from the remote parts of England, as well as from Scotland.3 In the feast which was given by the Archbishop of York, upon the marriage of Alexander the Third, sixty stalled oxen were slain to furnish out the first course, and the rest of the entertainment was on an equal scale of magnificence. It was the custom, at these feasts, to bring in the boar's head with great state ; sometimes the whole boar himself, stuffed, and standing on his legs, sur rounded by a fortification of pastry, from the battle- 1 Chamberlain's Accounts, p. 74 to 85. 2 Chronica.

In like manner, the pea cock, the swan, and the heron, were greatly esteemed in those times, and brought in, with their plumage unbroken, upon immense plateaus richly gilt, and with a net-work of gold thrown over them ; whilst between the courses the guests were entertained by a species of opera, acted by little puppets of paste, in which Arthur, and his Knights of the Round Table, Godfrey of Bulloign, or some such heroes, performed their parts, amidst magic islands, captive ladies, tur baned pagans, fiery dragons, and all the superstitious machinery of the middle ages. When this w^as con cluded, the company again resumed the feast, which was continued till a late hour, and often prolonged for many days. These were the solemn banquets of the middle ages ; but even their ordinary meals, when the ba ron, in his feudal hall, feasted his vassals twice a-day, were conducted with rude plenty and protracted hos pitality. They dined very early, and, from the quan tity of wines and spices imported into the country, there is reason to believe they sat late. In the reign of Alexander the Third, the famous Thomas the Rhymer, and the Earl of Dunbar, in whose castle he lived, sat down to dinner before twelve o'colck ; 1 and, between the diversion afford ed by the licensed wit of the fools, who were kept 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 131."], [447, "CHIVALRY\". 411 by the king and the higher nobles ; the hours spent in the game of chess, then exceedingly popular ; the listening to the lays of the harpers and minstrels, and the reading romances of interminable length, the day glided away.1 We are to remember, also, that much time was spent in the devotions of the Catho lic church ; that the labours of the needle and em broidery filled up many hours of a lady's life ; whilst the older knights and barons, who received into their castles the sons of the nobility, for the purpose of su perintending their chivalrous education, devoted much of their leisure to this occupation. In the speech which Walter Espec addresses to the English barons before the battle of the Standard, chess and dice are alluded to as the games in which the youthful knights passed their time ; while the reading works of his tory, or the listening to the gests of their warlike an cestors, are considered as the more appropriate em ployments of an aged baron.2 At an early period in our history, the system of chivalry made its way into Scotland, and gave that romantic and heroic tone to the character of the people which its usages, in a greater or less degree, commu nicated to every country in Europe. The early in tercourse of our country with Scandinavia, the pos session of the Western Isles and of part of the main land by the northern nations, and the circumstance 1 Rotuli Compotorum, Temp.

Their unshaken and generous courage ; the high and digni fied station occupied by their women ; their love of enterprise and adventure ; then- consideration for their scalds and minstrels, and their passion for marvel lous and romantic fictions, are just so many features which, with a slight change, we find in chivalry un der its more advanced and artificial shape. We are not, therefore, to wonder that, even as early as the end of the eleventh century, when Duncan, assisted by the Norman knights and soldiers of William Ru fus, expelled Donald Bane from the throne, the light of chivalry is seen beginning to dawn in Scotland;1 but the subsequent expulsion of the Normans and English, by the Celtic population, was unfavourable for a time to its further progress.2 Under Alexander the First, and during the reign of that wise and excellent prince, David the First, some faint and uncertain traces of chivalrous man ners and education are perceptible in the education of Henry of Anjou, at the court of the latter mo narch, and in the ceremony of the young prince receiving, from the hands of David, the order of i Chron.

It was not till Malcolm had gained his spurs in France, by fighting at the siege of Thoulouse, under the banner of the King of England, that this monarch, in the city of Tours, girded the youthful king with the belt of knighthood. During the same reign, we have an example of a ba ron accused of treason appealing to his sword, and perishing in single combat; and the spirited speech of William the Lion, when he, and a body of his ba rons, were surprised and taken prisoners before Aln wick, \" Now it will be seen who are good knights,\" is perfectly decisive as to the progress of chivalry in Scotland during the twelfth century.2 Indeed, the warm attachment of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, 1 Chron.

Accordingly, when William, in 1186, mar ried Ermengarde de Beaumont, part of the dower stipulated in the marriage contract consisted in the feudal services of forty knights ; 2 and the virtues of this monarch, as they are enumerated by Winton, his tenderness and fidelity in friendship, his generous emulation and companionship with Richard in deeds of renown, his courtesy and generosity, are all of them chivalrous. A passion for religious war, and a thirst for the glory which was gained against the Infidels, was the only ingredient wTanting to complete the chi valrous character of the country ; and this last prin ciple is to be seen in the conduct of David, Earl of Huntingdon, the brother of William the Lion, who assumed the cross immediately after his marriage, and departed for the Holy War, in company with Richard the First.3 Not long after the departure of the Earl of Hunt ingdon for the Holy Land, William Malvoisine, the 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 507.

Bishop of St Andrews, in a great council of the clergy, held at Perth, preached a crusade, and deputed many emissaries throughout Scotland to enforce the same holy warfare in their sermons and addresses to the people ; but, although multitudes of the middle and lower classes were infected with the mania, and as sumed the cross, they were joined by few of the rich and the powerful in the land.1 The tournaments we find an established amuse ment in Scotland under Alexander the Second. This monarch himself received the belt of knighthood from John, King of England ; and, under the reign of his successor, we see, in the remarkable debate which arose on the subject whether the youthful monarch could be crowned before he was knighted, how strong a hold the system and institutions of chivalry had ta ken of the national mind. When Bisset was accused of the murder of the Earl of Athole, he instantly ap pealed to his sword. The marriage of Alexander the Third ; the feasts and music ; the sumptuous dresses and magnificent largesses ; the future progresses of the youthful king and his consort to visit their fa ther's court, were full of all the pomp and circum stance of chivalry. The character of Alan Durward, celebrated as being the flower of Scottish knighthood ; the solemnity with which we- find this order confer red by the sovereign upon the sons of the nobility at the palace of Scone ; the increasing passion for the crusades ; and the departure of many of the Scottish 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 534."], [452, "416 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. nobles for Palestine, confirm this opinion ; 1 but it is chiefly under the reign of Bruce and his son, David the Second, that we discover the complete introduc tion of chivalry into Scotland. The work, indeed, to which this great king devo ted his life, was of too serious a nature to be often in terrupted or encroached upon by the splendid and fantastic trifling of chivalry. Yet, in personal prow ess, and the use of his weapons, Bruce was accounted one of the best knights in Europe ; and in Ireland we find the king halting the army, when retreating in circumstances of extreme difficulty, on hearing the cries of a poor lavendere, or washerwoman, who had been seized with labour, commanding a tent to be pitched for her, and taking measures for her pursu ing her journey when she was able to travel ; an ac tion full of the tenderness and courtesy so especially inculcated by chivalry, yet springing here, perhaps, not so much from the artificial feelings of a system, as from the genuine dictates of a brave and gentle heart. Bruce, and Douglas, and Randolph, it may be said, were too good soldiers and patriots to be diverted from their objects by the pursuit of personal adven ture ; but, from the nature of the long war with the English, feats of individual prowess, and gallant \" points of arms\" performed by a handful of brave vassals and partisans, were often the only efforts which kept up the desponding spirits of the nation ; and the spirit of chivalrous adventure, and of useful 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 72, 73, 80, 1 12, 1 13. 7"], [453, "CHIVALRY. 417 patriotic exertion thus became simultaneous and com patible in their operation. The battle of Bannock burn, it has been said by a historian of chivalry, was not a chivalrous battle.1 In one respect it assuredly was not similar to Poictiers and Cressy, which the same writer has dwelt on with justifiable enthusiasm ; for the laurels of Cressy and Poictiers were barren as to every thing but glory, while at Bannockburn, the freedom of a whole people was sealed and secured for ever. But it would be difficult, either at Cressy or Poictiers, to select two finer examples of chival rous daring than the defeat of Clifford by Randolph, and the single combat between Bruce and Bohun in the presence of the two armies ; and the courtesy of Bruce to his noble captives, is more natural than the overstrained generosity of the Black Prince to his royal prisoner King John. The well-known incident in the triumphant entry of the Black Prince into Lon don, when he himself was mounted on a little palfrey, whilst the person of the King of France was dis played upon a noble horse in gorgeous trappings, had something in it too ostentatious and condescending to merit the high encomium which has generally been bestowed on it. It is not to be forgotten also, in esti mating the comparative influence of chivalrous prin ciples upon the character of Bruce, when compared with that of the First and Third Edwards and the Black Prince, that during the whole reign of the Scottish king there does not occur, even in those mo- Mill's History of Chivalry, vol. i. p. 402. 2 D VOL.

But while Bruce was true to his chivalrous faith in kindness, cour tesy, and humanity, he permitted not the love of personal adventure to interfere with that strict mili tary discipline which he rigidly maintained ; and on one memorable occasion, in his Irish campaign, the king with his truncheon nearly felled to the ground a young knight named Sir Colin Campbell, for daring to break the array, that he might revenge an insult offered him by one of the skirmishers of the enemy.1 We have already seen what a rich glow of chivalrous devotion was shed over the last scene of his life ; and in the whole history of this singular system, which 1 Barbour, pp. 315, 316.

In this enquiry we have not yet made any re- marks upon the dress, the arms, and the warlike ac- coutrements of those remote times ; and yet the sub- ject, although of inferior interest to many other branches of the history of manners, is of considerable importance in estimating the civilisation of the pe- riod. Ascending, then, to that period under David the First, when, as we have already seen, his people were of a mixed race, including the tribes of Celtic original, as well as the Saxons and Normans, we find that the first-mentioned race were in dress and arms far inferior to his subjects of Gothic origin. They were armed with long spears pointed with steel, but so blunt as to be incapable of doing much execution, and which not unfrequently broke at the first thrust ;l they bore also darts or javelins, and made use of a hooked weapon of steel, with which they laid hold of their enemies ; their shields were formed of strong cow hide ; a rough mantle or outer coat of leather, tan- ned with the hair on, was thrown over their shoul- ders, which, on occasions of show or ceremony, was exchanged for a scarlet robe ; and their under vest ment was so short, that from the knee downwards the leg was wholly bare.2 They allowed their hair and 1 Ethelredus de Bello Standardi, p. 340. 2 \" Hispida Chlamys, Crus intectum.\" Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 82."], [456, "420 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. beards to grow to such a length, that their counte nances were almost covered. Even their nobles and leaders appear to have been strangers to the steel ar mour of the Saxons and Normans ; for we know that the Earl of Strathern, on the eve of the battle of the Standard, reproached David the First for trusting too much to the steel coats of his Norman subjects ; and boasted that, unarmed as he was, he would pre cede Alan de Percy in the onset.1 This dress and these weapons were common to the whole race of the Celts, and are evidently the same with those used by the Irish, as we find them described by one of the ablest antiquaries who has written upon the subject.2 The Galwegians appear to have been generally mount ed ; but they wTere accustomed to act, according to the emergency, either on foot or horseback, and, by the fury of their charge, which they accompanied with loud yells of \" Albyn ! Albyn !\" they not unfrequently succeeded in throwing into disorder, and eventually cutting to pieces, the more disciplined troops which were brought against them.3 They understood also the art of defending their mountain passes by barriers of trees, which they felled and placed transversely so as to impose an almost impenetrable barrier to an invading army.

In the beginning of the eleventh century, Eadulph-ludel, a Saxon earl, surrendered to Malcolm the Second all his right to the territory or province of Northum berland. Previous to this, the extensive district then denominated Cumberland, including the modern shires of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and part of Lancaster, had been acquired by the Scottish princes as feudatories of England ; and the marriage of David Earl of Cumberland, afterwards David the First, to the daughter of Earl Waltheof, procured as an ap panage to the Scottish crown a part of the ancient kingdom of Northumberland, then known by the name of the Earldom of Northumberland. All that fertile and extended tract of country which was form ed by the union of these successive acquisitions, and which comprehended the greater portion of the south of Scotland, was peopled by the Saxons and the Nor mans, whose dress and arms, at the period of which 1 Ethelredus de Bello StandarJi, p. 341."], [458, "422 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. we now speak, assimilated much to each other, the superiority in the richness of the stuffs, and in the temper of the armour and the weapons of offence, be ing on the side of the Normans. The sword of the Scoto-Saxons was, in all pro bability, exactly similar to that of the Anglo-Saxons, a long straight weapon, double-edged, and fitted both to cut and thrust. A late able English antiquary, in his deductions and delineations from ancient illu minated manuscripts, has thrown much light upon the subject; and, following his authentic descrip tions, we find that the shield was of a middle size, always convex, formed of wood covered with leather, and commonly armed in the centre with a strong sharp-pointed cone of iron.1 At a very early period, the Saxons do not appear to have used armour for the body, but to have gone into battle with a short upper coat of leather, which was girded round the loins, and beneath which are seen the folds of the under tunic worn close to the skin, and reaching to within a little of the knee.2 In persons of rank, the tunic and the coat were ornamented with rich bor ders round the edges, and the legs clothed in hose composed of twisted rolls of woollen, reaching to the middle calf, while the feet were shod with buskins. Besides the shield and the sword, they carried a long spear with a sharp steel point, sometimes arm ed with a barb, and the battle-axe ; but we do not 1 Meyrick's Ancient Armour, Introduction, vol. i. p. 62. 2 Ibid. p. 62."], [459, "ARMS AND DRESS. 423 find either the cross-bow or the long-bow originally employed by them. These last weapons were brought in by the Normans, who used them with fatal and murderous effect, and from whom the Saxon soldiers borrowed them in the course of years. The head of the common soldier was protected by a species of co- nical cap not unlike the Kilmarnock nightcap, which appears to have been made of the skin of some ani- mal, with the hair turned outwards. This headpiece, however, in persons of rank, was formed of steel or brass, and frequently ornamented with a broad gilded border, or even set with precious stones ; whilst in the dress of kings and princes it gave place to a crown itself, or to a small circlet of gold. The sword-hilts and scabbard, the shields and headgear, of the kings and nobles, were often richly ornamented, studded with precious stones, or inlaid with gold ; they ani- mated their troops with the sound of a long horn or trumpet, whilst there were carried before them into battle rich banners, upon which the figure of a white horse, of a raven, or a fighting warrior, were curious- ly wrought in gold, and not unfrequently decorated with jewels. In the battle of the Standard, the royal Scottish banner was embroidered with the figure of a dragon, around which rallying point, when the day was going against them, the flower of the Scottish army crowded in defence of their sovereign. The era, however, of the arrival of the Normans in England, and of the subsequent gradual and useful progress of this remarkable people from England into Scotland, till they fixed their Norman names and Norman cus-"], [460, "424 HISTORY\" OF SCOTLAND. toms even in the remote provinces of the north, is the era also of a very perceptible change in the dress, and arms, and warlike inventions of the Scoto-Sax ons. The shirt of mail was probably known to the Saxons in its first rude state. It was composed of small pieces of iron sewed in rows upon a leathern jacket, overlapping each other like the scales of a fish, and seems to have been early introduced. An experiment was next made to form something like the same piece of body armour, by twisting or inter weaving strong wires with each other, so as to create a species of iron wicker, which must, however, have proved particularly stiff and disagreeable to the free motion of the body. Probably for this reason it was not attempted to be carried lower down than the bot tom of the stomach, and a short way below the shoul der, so as to leave the arms and limbs full room for action. In time, however, these rude beginnings were superseded by more correct and skilful imitations of the armour of the Normans ; and as hitherto the chief force of the Scottish army had consisted in in fantry, it is curious to trace the gradual departure from this system as early as the reign of David the First, and the few feeble efforts which were then made to imitate the Normans, whose chief force con sisted in cavalry. As early, for instance, as in the battle of the Standard, the Scottish horsemen make their appearance, although bearing no proportion to the infantry ; and it is singular, that on both sides, the leaders made the cavalry dismount and fight on foot. Yet, under the reign of Alexander the Second,"], [461, "ARMS AND DRESS. 425 when that monarch invaded England, we have already seen the encomium pronounced by Matthew Paris up on his cavalry, which, although mounted on neither Spanish nor Italian horses, made a splendid and mar tial appearance ; and in the battle of Largs, in the subsequent reign, the destruction of the Norwegians who had landed, was completed by a Scottish army in which there was a body of fifteen hundred horse men, the knights and leaders of which were mounted on Spanish horses, armed, both horse and man, from head to heel in complete mail, and the rest on the small active horses, whose chests were protected by a steel breastplate. Besides this select body of ca valry, we find that the foot soldiers were well accou tred, and in addition to the long spear of the Saxons, they now carried the Norman bow.1 The principal arms of the Normans are well de scribed in an ordinance, or assize of arms, of Hen ry the Second, preserved by Hoveden, in which it is declared, that every man possessed of goods and chattels to the value of one hundred pounds, is to provide, for the king's service, a horse and a soldier completely armed in mail ; whilst every man possess ed of any sum, from forty to twenty-five pounds, was to have for his own use, an albergellum, or hauber geon, an iron helmet, a lance, and a sword. This re fers to the Norman dominions of the king. In Eng land, the same monarch commanded every man who held a knight's fee, to furnish a soldier completely 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. 93, 94, 95."], [462, "426 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. armed in a coat of mail and a helmet, with a lance and a shield ; every freeman who possessed goods and chattels to the value of sixteen merks, wras in like man ner ordained to have a coat of mail, a helmet, a shield, and a lance ; every freeman possessed of the value of ten merks, to have a haubergeon, an iron cap, and a lance ; and lastly, every burgess and freeman what soever, to furnish himself with a wambais, an iron cap, and a lance, which, on pain of severe penalties, he was not to sell or pawn.1 In the time, therefore, of Henry the Second, in the year 1181, which is the date of this assize, the principal armour for the body was of three kinds, the lorica, or entire coat of mail, the albergellum or haubergeon, and the wambais ; the first worn by the richest knights, the next by the higher order of yeomanry or gentry, and the last by the burgesses and freemen in general. What was the description of these particular kinds of body ar mour it is not difficult to ascertain, and it is certain that they were used promiscuously both in Scotland and in England. The lorica, or coat of mail, is to be seen distinctly on the seals of the First and Second Henry. It appears to have been formed by rings of steel or iron sewed, or fixed closely together, upon a leathern coat, reaching from the neck, which it co vers, to the knee, not unlike our modern surtout. In other instances, however, the neck and head were protected by a separate piece, called the chaperon, or hood of mail, which could either be drawn over the 1 Hoveden. p. 614. Rerum Angl. Script, a Saville."], [463, "ARMS OF THE SCOTO-NORMANS. 427 head in time of action, or after battle thrown loosely on the shoulder, so as to give the weary warrior air and refreshment. Over the chaperon the helmet was placed j1 and of this graceful costume, some beautiful examples are to be seen in the recumbent monuments of the knights which we frequently meet with in the English churches, and more rarely in Scotland. The sleeves of the coat, as seen in the seals of these two monarchs, cover the whole arm down to the wrist, leaving the hands bare and unprotected ; but an elongation of the coat of mail was soon after intro duced, so as to form a mailed glove, which com pletely protected the hands ; and yet from its pliancy, being formed of the same rings of steel quilted on a simple leather glove, left them free room for action. Over this mail-coat, which, under Richard the First,2 was so formed as to cover the whole body from head to heel, it became the fashion, during the reign of the Third Henry, for the knights to wear a surcoat, formed of cloth or linen, which at first appears to have been a mark of distinction, and which, latterly, during the fourteenth century, was ornamented with the arms of the knight, richly embroidered.

Second, did not become general till the time of John, and bore no armorial bearings till the period of Hen ry the Third.1 The albergellum, or haubergeon, in its early form, afforded less protection to the whole person than the coat of mail, and was evidently a less costly article of body-armour. It appears to be exactly the same piece of armour with the halsberga of Ducange, and was originally intended, as we learn from its compo nent words, hals-berg, for the protection of the neck alone ; but it probably soon came to cover the breast and the shoulder. It was formed of the same ring ed mail, quilted on leather,2 and is particularly men tioned in the assize of arms passed by Robert Bruce. The wambais was nothing more than a soldier's coat of-fence, made of leather, or cloth, quilted with cot ton, which, although it afforded a security inferior, in a great degree, both to the mail-coat and the hau bergeon, gave considerable protection against a spear thrust or sword-cut.3 It is well known, that while the great force of the Saxons consisted in infantry, the Normans fought on horseback ; and that, from a little after the time of William the Conqueror, the power of the Norman cavalry became so formida- 1 Meyrick's Ancient Armour, vol. i. p. 21. 2 So,in an old German anonymous poem quoted in Ducange, voce Halsberga. \" Geh and bring mir doch here, Mein halsperg und mem schwerd.\" And in the Will of Duke Everard in Mir\u00e6us, c. 21, \" Et helmum cum halsberga.\" 3 Ibid. p. 67."], [465, "ARMS OF THE SCOTO-NORMANS. 429 ble, as to be celebrated and dreaded throughout Eu rope. The horses were armed in steel as well as the men, and both being thus impenetrably protected, the long spears of their enemies might, to use an ex pression of Hoveden, \" have as well struck against a wall of iron.\"1 Under the Conqueror himself, in deed, and judging from the costume in which he is seen upon his seal, this horse-mail does not appear to have been used at all ; and the same observation is applicable to the seal of Henry the First, and to those of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, John, Henry the Third, and Edward the First. Upon the seal of Henry the Second, however, we find his horse armed with the ehamfreyn,or steel frontlet ; and the disappearance of it upon the seals of the monarchs who succeeded him, was evidently a caprice of taste, either in the artist or the sovereign ; for we know for certain, that the steel-clad steeds, or Equi Cooperti, formed the prin cipal force in the battle of the Standard, fought in the reign of Stephen, against David the First ; and we have already seen, that the Scottish cavalry at the battle of Largs was composed partly of Spanish steeds in complete armour, and partly of horses with breastplates ; a very convincing proof how complete ly the Norman habits and arms had been adopted in Scotland under Alexander the Third.2 The offensive weapons of the Norman knights and higher soldiers, consisted of the sword, which was in 1 Hoveden, p. 277.

The battle-axe, the mace of iron, and the short dagger, were adopted by the knights, and, along with the other arms of the lower ranks, borrowed by the Scoto-Normans from their countrymen, and introdu ced into Scotland. Thus, on the seal of Alexander the First of Scotland, who succeeded Malcolm Canmore, and whose sister Matilda married Henry the First of England, we find the scaled mail-coat composed of mascles, or lozenged pieces of steel, sewed upon a tu nic of leather, and reaching only to the mid thigh. The hood is of one piece with the tunic, and covers the head, which is protected with a conical steel cap, and a nasal. The sleeves are loose, so as to show the linen tunic worn next the skin, and again appear ing in graceful folds above the knee. The lower leg and foot are protected by a short boot armed with a spur. The king holds in his right hand a spear, to which a pennoncelle, or small flag, is attached, exactly similar to that worn by Henry the First. The saddle is peaked before and behind, and the horse on which he rides is ornamented by a rich fringe round the chest, but altogether unarmed.1 1 Seal in the Diplomata Scoti\u00e6, plate viii, and the plate in Dr Meyrick's History, p. 29, plate x."], [468, "432 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Another curious specimen of the Scottish armour of the twelfth century is to be seen on the seal of David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion. It is of the species called, by the contempo rary Norman writers, the \" trelissed,\" and consists of a cloth coat or vest, reaching only to the haunches, and with sleeves extending to the wrist. This is in tersected by broad straps of leather, laid on so as to cross each other, but to leave intervening squares of the cloth, in the middle of each of which is a round knob or stud of steel. The chaperon or hood is of quilted cloth, and the under tunic, of linen, covers the knee, and hangs in folds over the saddle, which is highly peaked, in the shape of a swan's neck. His shield is rounded at the top, and he holds a long spear, ornamented by a gonfanon, on which a rose is embroidered. His helmet is the conical one, plain, and worn over the hood, and the horse has neither armour nor trappings.1 It was this David, Earl of Huntingdon, who, having embarked for the Holy Land with Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, is said to have been shipwrecked on the coast of Egypt, and sold as a slave to a Venetian merchant. His master brought him to Constantinople, where he was fortunately re cognised by some English merchants, redeemed, and sent home.2 1 Meyrick, vol. i. p. 11. Anderson's Diplomata, plate x. 2 Chron.

On the shield of Prince Henry, grandfather of William the Lion, who died about sixty years before the accession of that prince to the throne, there is no appearance of any heraldic blazoning ; and the practice, which was first introduced by Richard C\u0153ur de Lion in to England, appears to have been adopted, during this interval, by our Scottish monarchs.1 The strict friendship and constant intercourse which was main tained between William the Lion and Richard the First, and the attention which was paid by the latter monarch in Europe and in Palestine to every thing connected with the improvement of the military art, must have produced a correspondent enthusiasm in our own country, and these improvements would speedily be brought into Scotland by David, Earl of Hunting don, and his companions, the brother crusaders of an amusing but superficial work, which he has entitled a History of Chivalry, affects to despise the Critical Enquiry of Dr Meyrick. That there may be some few errors in an enquiry embracing so wide a range, none will deny ; but, in point of research and histori cal interest, it is worthy of great praise. It is to be regretted that the valuable matter of the text should be shut up from most read ers by the costly price, which the plates render indispensable. 1 Anderson's Diplomata Scoti\u00e6, plate xx.

This observation is accordingly confirmed by the fact just noticed, that Richard first bore the three lions on his shield, and that the same practice, formerly unknown, was adopted not long after in our own country. Another change appears in the helmet of Alexan der the Second, which confirms this remark ; the aven tayle, or visor, and the cylindrical shape, are seen in its construction for the first time ; and these we know were brought in by Richard the First, although un der a slightly different form as used by the lion hearted king. This Alexander succeeded his brother William the Lion in the beginning of the thirteenth century. He appears clothed in a complete coat of mascled mail, protected by plates at the elbows. The surcoat also, first worn in England by John, is thrown over his armour, \u2014 another proof of the progress of mi litary fashions from England into this country ; and his shield is hollowed, so as to fit the body and com pletely defend it. His horse, without any defensive armour, is ornamented with a fringed and tasselled border across the chest, and an embroidered saddle cloth, on which the lion rampant again appears.1 Under the succeeding reigns of Alexander the Third, Baliol, Bruce, and his son, David the Second, the military costume, the fashion, shape, and ornaments of the arms, and the science of war, appear to have been almost exactly the same in both countries.

A plume of feathers surmounts the helmet, and the same or nament is seen on the head of his horse.1 Little dif ference is discernible in the military costume of Ro bert Bruce, except that his steel casque is surmount ed by a royal crown, which we have seen him wear ing at the battle of Bannockburn. As the arms and military costume of both coun tries appear to have been exactly similar, so we may, with equal truth, apply the same remark to the science of war itself. The superior genius of Bruce soon indeed perceived, that to cope with the English in cavalry was impossible, and he accordingly di rected his principal attention to perfecting the arms and the discipline of his infantry, \u2014 a system taught him by the example of Wallace ; but this was chiefly occasioned by the poor and exhausted state of the country. Previous to the long war of liberty, which drained away its wealth, and arrested it in its career of improvement, the cavalry of Scotland, as we have seen in our former allusions to the battle of the Stand- 1 Anderson's Diplomata, plate xxxvi.

The disastrous de feat which David experienced in the first of these ac tions was, in all probability, occasioned by his being compelled to place the ferocious and half-armed Gal wegians in the first line ; and, even after their undis ciplined conduct had introduced disorder and flight, the day was nearly restored by a successful charge of the Prince of Scotland, at the head of his men-at arms, who, to use the expressive phrase of Ethelred, \" scattered the English army like a cobweb.\" In the battle of Largs, the appearance of the Scottish knights on Spanish horses, then considered of high value, and which were clothed in complete mail, evinces that, under Alexander the Third, the ca valry of Scotland was equal in equipment to the sister country. We learn, from the Chamberlain's rolls of the same monarch, that, in the preparations which were made for defence and security in the dif ferent castles about the time of the expected invasion of the King of Norway, the warlike engine called the balista was in use ; and that there was an officer in the castle of Aberdeen called Balistarius, who was allowed twenty shillings for the purchase of staves, and other necessaries which belonged to his office.1 1 Chamberlain's Rolls, Temp.

It is evident, from the history of the Bruce and Baliol wars, and the most remarkable sieges which took place during their continuance, that, in whatever terms of wonder these warlike machines for the battering of the walls are described by the contemporary historians, they were truly very clumsy and inefficient inventions ; and that a strong-built castle, if well victualled, and to lerably garrisoned, could defy, for many months, the whole efforts of a very numerous army, with its ba list\u00e6, mangonels, tribuchets, sows, and rams playing upon it without intermission. During the reigns of Edward the Second and Third in England, and the corresponding period occupied by the latter years of the reign of Robert Bruce, and the whole of that of David the Second in Scot land, the plate-armour began gradually to super sede the mailed coat ; and various improvements and new inventions, both in the strength and in the orna mental parts of the equipment of knights and sol diers, were introduced, which, from the constant in- \" Item quod die hujus computi remanserunt in custodia ipsius, H. 12 lorice, 2 honbergell, unam par calligarum ferrearum, 14 targyss, et 12 bipennes.\" 1 Rich.

In 1367, a duel was fought between Thomas Erskine, a Scottish knight, and James Douglas of Egmont, on some quarrel not now discoverable. Both champions obtained permission from Edward the Third to purchase their arms and body armour, on this occasion, in London ; and the royal letters inform us of what pieces they consisted. A breast-plate and back-piece, a helmet, a haber geon, arm-plates, thigh-pieces, greaves for the legs, and iron gauntlets, formed the body armour. The weapons were, a dagger or short sword, a long sword, and a knife ; and one of the knights requests to have body armour for two horses, whilst his antagonist contents himself with a chamfeyn or iron frontlet for one.1 In the use of the bow, the English continued inva riably to be superior to the Scots, and their bodies of mounted archers, and of cross-bowmen, who were not unfrequently armed in mail, often made cruel havock amongst the Scottish spearmen. It is a singular cir cumstance, that, although the importance of the long bow could not fail to have suggested itself to such mas ters in war as Wallace and Bruce, and Randolph and Douglas, there does not appear to have been any very successful efforts made to introduce it as a national weapon. In remote times, indeed, we find the Scottish archers bearing a part in the battle of the Standard ;2 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 916, 917. 2 Ethelredus de Bello Standardi, p. 342, \" Alteram aciem silius"], [475, "439 ART OF WAR. but, at the subsequent battles of Dunbar, Stirling, and Falkirk, they do not appear. In the memorable defeat, indeed, which Bruce gave to the Lord of Lorn, in the pass of Cruachan-Ben, Sir James Douglas appears at the head of a body of archers lightly armed,1 but they are not to be recognised in the muster of the army at Bannockburn ; and although Bruce, in an ordinance of arms passed in 1319, commands every man possessed of the value of a cow to arm himself, either with a bow and a sheaf of arrows, or with a spear, the last weapon was evidently preferred by the Scottish yeomanry. Neither in the future expedi tions during the reign of this monarch, nor in the disastrous battles of Dupplin, Halidon, and Durham, do we meet with a body of Scottish archers.2 With regard to the first of these battles at Halidon, there is to be found, in the British Museum, amongst the Harleian Manuscripts, a most minute and curious account of the numbers, the arms, and the arrange ment of the Scottish army, with the names of all the leaders ;3 which proves that the Scottish army consisted of knights, and of heavy-armed and light armed infantry, without either archers or cross-bow- regis, et militis, Sagittariique cum eo, adjunctis sibi Cumbrensibus et Tevidalensibus, cum magna sagacitate constituit.\" 1 Barbour, pp. 190, 191. 2 At the siege of Perth, however, under the Regency of Moray, Fordun mentions that Alan Boyd and John Stirling, \" duo valentes armigeri, rectores architenentiuni,\" were slain. 3 This interesting fragment is printed in the Appendix, letter D."], [476, "440 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. men. The same remark may be made with regard to the array at the battle of Durham ; the knights armed cap-a-pie, with the homines armati, or heavy armed infantry, formed the strength of the army ; and besides this there was a very large body of half-arm ed foot.1 The ordinance of arms which was passed by Robert Bruce in 1319, acquaints us, in sufficiently minute terms, with the arms then used by the Scot tish army. An acton and a steel helmet, gloves of plate, and a sword and spear, were to be provided by every gentleman who had ten pounds value in land, or ten pounds of movable property. Those of infe rior rank and fortune were bound to fit themselves with an iron jack, an iron head-piece, and gloves of plate ; and the lowest class of all with a spear, or with a bow and a sheaf of arrows.2 The civil dress of those remote times, as it is seen in the illuminations of manuscripts, and in the re verses of the seals of our early monarchs, appears to have been exceedingly rich and graceful. A robe of purple velvet or scarlet cloth, richly lined and hooded with ermine, with a border of gold embroidery, and flowers of gold scattered over it ; an under tunic of silk, or other precious stuff, made sometimes close to the figure, and at other times hanging in loose folds almost to the heel ; hose and breeches in one piece ; and laced sandals, formed the common state dress of the kings, princes, and nobles, their more ordinary 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 342. 2 History, vol. i. p. 354. See Appendix, letter Q."], [477, "441 CIVIL DRESS OF THE PERIOD. habits being nearly the same in shape, but of less costly materials.1 During the thirteenth century, a fantastic fashion prevailed of clothing one-half of the figure in one co lour, and the other half in another ; and, where this was not done, of having one stocking red or blue, and the other green or yellow ; so that the man had the appearance of having stept into one half of his neigh bour's breeches or hose. But the absurd practice did not long continue, and appears to have been at last abandoned to the exclusive use of fools and jesters. The costume of the ladies at the same period was particularly elegant, but very. various ; and it is diffi cult, in any written description, to give an idea either of its beauty, or of the complicated grouping of its various parts. The upper part of the dress consist ed of a jacket of rich broad cloth or velvet, with sleeves reaching to the wrist, and terminating in a border of gold embroidery, which was made to fit close to the bosom and the waist, so as to show the outline of the female figure. It was fastened down the middle with a row of buttons of silver, gold, or 1 Strutt's Dress and Habits of the People of England, vol. ii. plates 83 and 85. Chamberlain's Accounts, Temp. Alex.

Below this jacket appeared, in ample folds, an under robe or tunic of a different colour, and under all, a slip or petticoat of silk or linen. The tucker was high and modest, and made so as to leave only the neck and throat bare. The head-dress consisted either of the wimple, of the tur ban, or of a small circlet of gold, or garland of arti ficial flowers, from beneath which the hair sometimes flowed down the back, and sometimes was gracefully plaited or braided in forms of great variety. Over the whole dress, it was not uncommon, on days of state or ceremony, to wear a long cloak of velvet or other precious stuff, which was clasped across the bosom, and lined with ermine, martins, or gold lace. The golden girdle, too, worn round the waist, and sometimes set with precious stones, must not be for gotten. The extreme splendour of the civil dresses of this period, both in England and in Scotland, is alluded to in terms of reprobation by Mathew Paris in his account of the marriage of Alexander the Third at York ; and as the monastic historian was himself present, his account is the more curious and authentic.1 It proves very satisfactorily, that the dresses of the higher ranks in England, Scotland, and France, were the same. A passage, therefore, which we find quoted by Strutt, from an ancient MS his- 1 Math. Paris, pp. 715, 716."], [479, "CIVIL DRESS OF THE PERIOD. 443 tory of France, written in the fourteenth century, may be quoted as throwing light upon the extreme splendour of the dress of this period. It alludes to a sumptuous entertainment given at Paris in 1275, on the coronation of Mary. \" The barons and the knights were habited in vestments of various colours ; sometimes they appeared in green, sometimes in blue, then again in grey, and afterwards in scarlet, varying the colours according to their fancies. Their breasts were adorned with fibul\u00e6 or brooches of gold, and their shoulders with precious stones of great magni tude, such as emeralds, sapphires, jacinths, pearls, ru bies, and other rich ornaments. The ladies who attended had rings of gold, set with topaz stones and diamonds, upon their fingers, their heads were orna mented with elegant crests or garlands, and their wimples were composed of the richest stuffs, embroi dered with pure gold, and embellished with pearls and other jewels.\" In the ancient French poem, the Romance of the Rose, which was completed by John de Meun in 1304, the poet has introduced the story of Pigmalion, and he represents the enamoured sculptor clothing his mar ble mistress in every variety of female finery. \" He ar rayed her,\" says he, \" in many guises ; in robes made with great skill of the finest silk and woollen cloths, green, azure, and brunette, ornamented with the richest skins of ermines, minivers, and greys ; these being taken off, other robes were tried upon her of silk, cendal, malliquins, mallibruns, damasked satin, camlet, and all of divers colours.

Then again he put a wimple upon her head, and over that a coverchief, which concealed the wimple, but hid not her face. AH these garments were then laid aside for gowns, yellow, red, green, and blue, and her hair was handsomely disposed in small braids, with threads of silk and gold, adorned with little pearls, upon which was placed, with great precision, a crestine, and over the crestine a crown or circle of gold, enriched with precious stones of va rious sizes. Her little ears, for such they are said to have been, were decorated with two beautiful pend ent rings of gold, and her necklace was confined to her neck by two clasps of gold. Her girdle was ex ceedingly rich, and to it was attached an aulmoniere, or small purse of great value.\"1 This amusing and curious passage gives us some idea of the variety and splendour of the female dress of the times : and we may conceive what a noble spectacle it must have been, to have seen an' ancient Gothic hall filled with fair forms in such splendid apparel, and crowded with barons, knights, squires, and pages, in their vel vet robes and jewelled girdles, glancing, as they moved, to the rays of the sun, as they streamed through the painted windows ; or assembled at night, while the 1 I have employed the translation, or rather the abstract of this passage given by Mr Strutt in his excellent work on the Habits and Dresses of the People of England, from a manuscript in the British Museum.

Two large quarto volumes of these accounts, which contain all that is yet printed, were politely communicated to me by Mr Thomp son, the present Clerk Register, to whose learning and enthu siasm the legal antiquities of the country are under deep obliga tions. Neither of these volumes has as yet been published, as the Preface and Appendix to be subjoined to each is not yet printed ; but when completed, the work will he one of the most valuable which has ever been presented to the student of the his tory and antiquities of his country.

From the extreme minuteness of the details, and the perfect authenticity of the records, there is a freshness and a truth in the pictures which they present, no where else to be met with.

Even within the small limits of this extract, it will be seen that much curious and interesting information is to be found. The prices of grain, and the quantities furnished for the con sumption of the royal household at Cardross, (it will be recol lected that Robert Bruce spent there the two last years of his life, 1328, 1329,) the prices of the provisions for the larder, which consisted of marts, sheep, salted salmon, and numerous other articles not in this extract, enable us to form a pretty correct idea of the mode of living at this time. From the next passage, we are not only able to glean some information as to the state of the necessary and ornamental arts, but we obtain, at the same time, an interesting view of the occupations of this great king during the last year of his life. We see him and his illustrious nephew, Randolph, employing their rural leisure in experiments in ship building and navigation, although the circumstance, that one of the king's great ships could be hauled from the frith to the running stream (rivulum) beside the manor of Cardross, gives us a very contemptible idea of the size of these vessels. The house for the king's hawks, and the expenses paid for the jour ney of Patrick the Fool, from England to Tarbart, are examples of the entries in these records which throw light on the man ners of the times. Of the obscure sentence regarding the house which was constructed \" ad opus oulquhanorum domini regis,\" I am unable to give any explanation ; but innumerable other pas sages might be selected, which would prove the high interest and value of these accounts.

Letter B, p. 10. Death of Randolph. Barbour, the metrical historian of Bruce, whose work is of the highest authority, informs us that Randolph was poisoned, without adding any particulars.

Bot syne, atlace ! pnsoynl tecs he ; To see his dede was gret pitc Baubouh, p. 423. Barbour is generally believed to have been born about 1316, and, according to Lord Hailes' conjecture, was fifteen years old at the period of the death of Randolph. I woidd ask, on what grounds are we entitled to set aside such an authority ? Winton is supposed, by his able editor, M'Pherson, to have been bom about the year 1350, (Preface to Winton's Chronicle, p. 19,) only eighteen years after the death of Randolph. He composed his Chronicle in his old age, having commenced it in 1420, and finished it in 1424. (Ibid. p. 22.) His account is as follows."], [489, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 453 \" Darefore with slycht thai thoct to gere Hym wyth wenenous fell poyson Be destroyed, and fel tiesoun And that thai brocht sune til endyng Be sum tresounabill undertakyng ; For at the Wemyss, be the se, Poysotenyd at afest wes 7i\u00a3.\"___.Vol. ii, p. 146. This is pretty direct testimony also. Let us next turn, not to Fordun, for he omits all mention of the circumstance ' of the poisoning, and simply states the death of the Regent, but to his continuator, Bower, who, as we learn from himself, was born fifty-three years after the death of Randolph,2 in the year 1385. \" Et ideo,\" says he, speaking of the designs of the disinherited barons against Randolph, \" novam artem confixerunt, et ut [talici ferunt, bello tradimento verius viii effecerunt, ut quidam Anglicus religione corruptus dicto custodi familiaris capellanus, sibi venenum in vino propinaret. Quod et factum est ut supra.\" Hailes, in opposition to these respectable authorities, pronounces the story of the death of Randolph by poison to be a silly po pular tale, and affirms that he was afflicted in the decline of life with a confirmed stone ; that in the progress of the disease he became gradually worse, was seized with colic pains, and at length died. It is singular that this circumstance of Randolph being afflicted with the stone, as well as the minute detail of the progress of the disease, on which Hailes' whole theory rests, is not supported by an atom of authentic evidence. It rests solely on the authority of Hector Boece, whom Hailes in almost every page represents, and truly represents, as a romancer, who is unworthy of all credit. Barbour, Winton, and Bower, say not a word of it, but describe Randolph as being in the active discharge of his duties as governor, when he was suddenly cut off by the treachery of his enemies. Yet this historian does not hesitate to adopt the fabrication of an author whom none can trust, and whom, on other subjects, he never trusts himself, in order to support an attack against the Scottish historians. As 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1018. 2 Lib. xiv. c. 50,"], [490, "454 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. for poor Hector, he is treated rather cavalierly, being first com pelled to act as an ally, and then summarily put down as a fa bricator. In speaking of the Scottish historians, we must be careful to separate Boece and his followers from those who flou rished before him. The last class, including Barbour, Winton, Fordun, and Bower, are highly valuable ; the first, full of inven tion and apocryphal details. For instance, Hailes observes, that the Scottish historians pretend that Randolph was poisoned by a vagrant monk from England, and that this was executed with the knowledge of Edward the Third. Now, neither Bar bour nor Winton, as we see, say a word of Randolph being poisoned by a monk far less an English monk ; and Fordun, al though he lays the crime on an Ijiglish chaplain, does not allege that Edward was privy to the plot. Boece, however, and those who followed him, assert both facts. Letter C, p. 30. Death of Seton. Hailes, in his Annals, has omitted the circumstance of Edward the Third having hanged the son of Sir Alexander Seton, reserving it as a historical problem, to be treated of in a separate disserta tion. In the dissertation given in the appendix, the fact of Seton's death is established beyond doubt, yet in future editions the scepticism of the text is retained. The result of the disser tation is satisfactory in one way, as it proves that Winton and Fordun are corroborated in every particular by the narrative of the Scala Chronicle. Their account also of Seton being gover nor of the town, is confirmed by the testimony of the Chamber lain's Accounts. Letter D, page 32. Battle of Halidon Hill. Extract from a MS.

Hailes (Annals, vol. ii. p. 218), in his observations on the con duct of the Steward of Scotland at the battle of Durham, has this passage : \" Boece, b. xv. sol. 324, has been pleased to assert, that the Steward and the Earl of March, perceiving that the forces under their command were dispirited, and unwilling to fight any longer, withdrew them to a place of safety.\" He adds, \" that this retreat was the cause of all the disasters which ensued. \" Hailes then observes, that the proper vindication of the Steward is, that the narrative of Boece, although not altogether of his own invention, has no warrant from Fordun, or from any English historian of considerable antiquity. I have no desire to support the character of Boece, the most apocryphal of all our historians ; but as I have differed entirely, in this part of the history, from the view given of this battle by Hailes, it is necessary to observe, that this has been done on authentic grounds ; and I must remark, that this historian had certainly read Fordun's account of the bat tle of Durham in a very cursory way ; for, instead of giving no support to Boece, this ancient chronicler describes the flight of the Steward and the Earl of March in strong expressions. \" Om nibus captis,\" say he, \" exceptis Patricio de Dunbar et Roberto Sever Scotis, qui fugam capientes ill\u0153si abierant.\" \u2014 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1038. The Scala Chronicle, a contemporary English authority, of which Leland has given extracts in his Collectanea, also corroborates the account of Fordun. \" The Counte of March and the Seneschal of Scotland fled.\" To say that the Steward fled from the field without striking a blow, would be highly inaccurate, for we know from Winton that he sustained great loss ; but that, seeing the day on every side going against"], [496, "460 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. them, he and the Earl of March effected their retreat without attempting to rescue the king, seems to be the fact ; and it is quite evident that David never forgave it.

The limits to which this note must be confined will not allow me to give further extracts from this curious manuscript rental, demonstrating the riches of the early monasteries. It appears,"], [516, "480 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in the concluding pages of it, that Kelso possessed no less than thirty-four churches, the united rents of which amounted to the simi of vcli lib. xi solid, iiii denarii. The rental was drawn up previous to 1316. Letter O, page 256. Slavery of the Lower Orders. In the ancient manuscript Cartulary of Dunfermline, and page 541 of the Macfarlane transcript, is to be found the deed enti tled, \" Perambulatio inter terras Abbatis de Dumferm. et terram David Hostiarii. scilicet Dunduf. 1231,\" which illustrates the comparative situation of the higher classes and the lower orders, in the thirteenth century. A jury of probi homines are therein summoned by the precept of the king, to determine the marches between the lands of David Durward and the domain of the Abbacy, who take the evidence of the countrymen residing on the spot, and determine the question. The jury are the free men ; and their names are, with a few exceptions, Saxon and Norman names : the witnesses were evidently the nativi bondi, who were the property of their lord ; and their names are al most exclusively Celtic. In the same Cartulary, p. 592, will be found a deed entitled, \" Assisa ISuper Alano, filio Constantini et duobus filiis,\" by which we find that, in 1340, an assize was held in the churchyard of Kartyl before David Wemyss, sheriff of Fife, to determine whether Alan, the son of Constantine, and his two sons, were the property of the Abbot of Dunfermline, or of the Earl of Fife, when it was found, \"per fidelem assisam fide dignoram et nobi lium,\" that these persons belonged to the Lord Abbot of Dun fermline. See the same Cartulary, p. 654, for the names of the slaves given by David, probably David the First, to the church of Dunfermline. Their names, Marcoran, Mevynir, Gyllemichael, Malmuren, Gillecrist, Gillemahagu, are, with one or two excep tions, Celtic. 1"], [517, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 481 Letter P, page 257. State of the Lower Orders. In the same valuable Cartulary, p. 145, are to be found many genealogies of the slaves, or bondmen, who belonged in property to the monastery, which show how carefully the marriages, the families, and the residence, of this unfortunate class of men were recorded. I shall subjoin one of them : Genealogia Edillblac. \" Edillblac genuit W. de Lathanland, Willmus Constantinum, Constantinus Johannem qui vivit : Iste sunt homines de Dum ferm. et remanentes.

There yet remain a few gleanings of information upon the state of some of the ornamental and useful arts in Scotland, too scanty to be included under any separate division, and which yet appear of importance, when we are collecting every scattered light which may serve to illustrate the manners and civil history of the country. At a very early period, for instance, we can just trace an interesting attempt of David the First, to soften the manners of his people by introducing a taste for gardening. He spent some portion of his time, as we learn from his friend and contemporary, in his orchard in planting young trees, or in the more difficult operation of grafting ; and it was his anxious de sire to encourage the same occupations amongst his subjects. The gardener appears constantly in the Chamberlain's Accounts as"], [521, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 485 an established servant, attached to their different palaces and manors. Alexander the Third had his gardeners at Forfar and Menmoreth.1 The royal garden at Edinburgh appears as early as 1288 ; and the Cartularies contain ample evidence, that the higher nobles and dignified clergy, and even the lesser knights and barons, considered their gardens and orchards as in dispensable accompaniments to their feudal state.2 It must be evident to any one who has perused this Enquiry, that besides this elegant branch of rural economy, many of the other useful and ornamental arts must have arrived, during this period, at a state of very considerable perfection in Scotland. The pitch of excellence, for instance, to which the architecture of the country had attained, necessarily includes a correspondent excellence in the masons, the carpenters, the smiths, the plumb ers, the plasterers, the painters, and the glaziers, of those re mote times. The art of working skilfully in steel and iron must have been well known, and successfully practised, by a people and a nobility armed and accoutred for war, in the fashion we have just described; and the mysteries of embroidery and needle work, with the professions of the clothier, silk-merchant, milli ner, and tailor, could not fail to thrive and become conspicuous in so splendid a court, and amid such a display of dames and knights as we have seen thronging the royal residences during the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The jeweller, too, the goldsmith, and the enameller, must have been lucrative professions, where the girdles, ear-rings, brooches, tiaras, and jackets of velvet, powdered with pearls, were conspi cuous articles in female dress ; and where the palls, copes, rac quets, crosiers, censers, and church plate, were still more sump tuous and extravagant. There is, accordingly, decided evidence in the Chamberlain's Accounts, that the art of working in the pre cious metals had attained to considerable perfection, although in the sumptuous extent of their gold and sUver plate, the kings and nobles of Scotland appear to have been very far inferior to l Chamberlain's Accounts, Temp.

In the sketch of the learning of those re mote times, I have said nothing of the state of the healing arts, during a period when it may be thought, from the frequency of war and bloodshed, their ministration was much called for. But, unfortunately, upon this subject no authentic data remain, upon which an opinion may be formed ; yet it has been already seen that our kings had their apothecaries and physicians. As to the actual skill, the prescriptions and operations of such persons, we are quite in the dark ; but, if we may form our opinion from the low and degraded condition of the healing art in England at the same period, the patient who fell into the hands of these feudal practitioners must have rather been an object of pity than of hope. And it is probable, that a sick or wounded knight had a better chance for recovery from the treatment of the gentle dames or aged crones in the castles, whose knowledge of simples was often very great, than from the mixture of quackery and su perstition which was inflicted upon him by the accredited leeches of the times. i Chamberlain's Accounts, pp. 98, 187, 228, 411. end of volume second.
