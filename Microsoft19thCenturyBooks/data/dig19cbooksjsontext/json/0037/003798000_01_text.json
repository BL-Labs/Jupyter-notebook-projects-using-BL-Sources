Last year the Kings of Siam and Cambodia left, for the first time in history, their capital cities, and travelled in search of instruction and pleasure, the one to Java and India and the other to Hong Kong and Peking. Opinions, laAvs, customs, even rehgions, Avhich have been rooted and established for ages, are gra dually undergoing change, and a change on the whole for the better.

RANGOON It Avas ac daybreak on the 2nd of April, 1871, that we \u2014 an English friend was with me \u2014 first saw the shores of Burma. We had been a short time at sea, having left Madras eight days previously, but the end of the voyage was none the less welcome, for it was about the season that the monsoon changes, and those terrific revolving storms called cyclones sweep the upper part of the Bay of Bengal, so often with fatal effect. Our steamer was the ' Oriental ' (Capt. Smith). We had a full list of passengers, many of them being English officers, avIio were ordered from various Indian stations to the cantonment of Tounghoo, on the Sittang u"], [32, "2 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT river, in north-eastern Burma. The route usually taken by these steamers \u2014 calling at Masulipatam, Coconada, Vizagapatam, and Bimlipatam on the coast of India, and thence nearly due east to Eangoon \u2014 is about a thousand miles in length. We enjoyed a remarkably pleasant voyage. Masu- lipatam Avas reached on the second day. This towu is of importance only as being the nearest seaport to the large city of Secunderabad, in the Nizam's dominions of Southern India. In 1865 a tremendous cyclone and tidal Avave destroyed thirty thousand of the in- habitants, and nearly all the buildings of the town. Co- conada is a larger town than Masulipatam, and from it are exported large quantities of cotton, castor-oil, seeds, and grain. On the third day Ave anchored off Viza- gapatam, a large toAvn, most picturesquely situated on a plain surrounded by gently sloping hills, near the sea shore. The houses are built of mud and unburnt bricks ; and crowning the summits of several of the nearer hills are graceful little temples ; and at their bases date and cocoa palms, whose green, feathery leaves add very much to the beauty of the scene. Leaving Bimlipatam \u2014 a simple cluster of mud huts \u2014 we saw nothing but sky and water until the lighthouse on the Alguada reef, fifteen or twenty miles distant'from Cape"], [33, "3 RANGOON Negrais (the south-Avest extremity of Pegu), rose up from the ocean's bed before us. It is erected on a very dangerous reef, more than a mile in length, and much of Avhich is only just abo\\re water at low tide. The shaft, built of a red stone, is 160 feet in height, and, no land being in sight, certainly presented a most singular appearance ; hoAvever, with our binoculars Ave could distinguish two or three lines of billows dashing themselves one after another upon the dark rocks. Soon after ' sighting ' the land we received on board the pilot, and then half an hour's steaming brought us to the mouth of the Eangoon river, Avith its low, wooded shores, and red obelisks on either headland \u2014 Avarnings to the mariner. Sandbanks, whose edges are marked by large iron buoys indicating the channel's bed, stretched for a long distance out to sea. We passed a dozen or more large ships before reaching the river's mouth ; these, the captain informed us, an chored there in order to free themselves from the port dues to Avhich they would be subject if lying at the city, and the masters go ' up to town ' and engage their cargoes. At its entrance the Eangoon river is two miles in Avidth, while opposite the city, twenty-six miles above, it narrows to about a third of a mile, with four or five fathoms' depth. The foreign ships anchored B 2"], [34, "4 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT in the river made a very considerable show, our visit being at the height of the rice season. Eangoon, lying upon level ground, extends for about a mile along the river, and perhaps three times that distance inland. By the bank of the river there runs a broad maca damised street, called ' the Strand,' and facing this are the Government offices and many imposing and sub stantial stores and dAvelling-houses. The city abounds Avith rich tropical foliage, which shades many of the teak and bamboo built huts, and from the steamer's deck we can see a small English cantonment, tAvo or three European churches, and several large pagodas, with gilded and richly ornamented spires. Beyond the city we see a j ungle of palms and bananas, and bamboos stretching away, a Avaving sea of green, to the very horizon itself. The country about Eangoon \u2014 the delta of the great Irrawaddy river \u2014 is of much the same nature as that at the embouchure of the Ganges, being Ioav, sandy, and muddy, and subject to tremendous floods in the rainy season. There are two or three hotels in Eangoon, but tliese were full, and not being able to obtain rooms in any private dwelling, Ave were compelled ' to go to house keeping,' i.e. to have an entire cottage and order our meals from a neighbouring bakery. The next few days"], [35, "RANGOON 5 Avere pleasantly passed in seeing ' the sights ' of the city. Eangoon, the commercial capital of Burma, was founded by King Alompra, the Burmese conqueror of Pegu, in 1755, and was peopled by the inhabitants of the ancient capital of the province, Avho were brought aAvay for that purpose. It was captured by the British during the first Burmese war in 1824, but was afterwards restored. In 1852 it again fell into the hands of the English, and will now remain, doubtless, permanently in their possession. The population at present is about 60,000 \u2014 Burmese, Chinese, and Hindoos. The streets of Eangoon are laid out at right angles, and most of them are broad, macadamised, and clean. The greater part of the European private residences are raised upon piles. These are built of plain teak boards and have tiled roofs, but the native towu or quarter is very mean-looking, the huts there being of bamboo, with palm-leaf thatched covers. The most wonderful sight in Eangoon is the great Shoay Dagon, or Golden Pagoda \u2014 the largest edifice of the kind in Burma, and probably the largest in the world. It is situated about a mile from the city upon a hill perhaps eighty or a hundred feet in height, The entrance, guarded by two huge griffins of brick"], [36, "6 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT and mortar, passes between long narrow sheds, which are beautifully carved and gaudily painted in ver milion and gold, and covered Avith horrid represen tations of the Budhistic tortures reserved for the damned ; and thence, mounting a very dilapidated staircase, the immense stone terrace upon which the pagoda itself stands is reached. This terrace is nearly a thousand feet square, and the base of the structure, standing at its centre, is octagonal-shaped and fifteen hundred feet in circumference, Avhile the entire height of the pagoda is three hundred feet. It is built of solid masonry and lime, covered Avith gold leaf, and gradually tapers to a spire, which terminates in a tee (umbrella), an open iron-Avork cap, twenty-six feet in height. The gold upon this pagoda is said to equal the Aveight of a former Burmese king, and the spire blazes so fiercely under a noonday's sun as to almost dazzle the beholder. At the base of the immense structure are broad stone steps and large griffins, and also some smaller pagodas of like design and finish. Within the enclosure of the pagoda are many temples, most of them containing huge images of Gaudama (the last Budha), made of wood, brick and lime, marble and metal, and nearly all thickly gilded ; some of the sitting figures are twelve feet, and some of"], [37, "GA1JDAMA, THE LAST BUDHA"], [38, ""], [39, "7 RANGOON the standing ones as much as eighteen feet in height.

This gave them the appearance of coats of mail, and Avhen different coloured glasses were used in a court dress the effect was quite gay. Some of the idols Avere clothed in yelloAV garments \u2014 yellow being the ordained colour of all priestly robes. On small tables in front of many of the images were placed candles, flowers, and little paper flags ; some of these being used in the forms of worship, and some having been presented as offerings by religious devotees. Lofty poles were planted at short intervals around the pagoda. These were croAvned with tees, and also at several feet from their tops were fixed rudely made game-cocks \u2014 the national emblem of the Burmese\u2014 and the remainder of the pole was hung with vari- coloured streamers. Burma is well known to be one of the strongholds of Budhism. The Shoay Dagon pagoda derives its peculiar sanctity from being the depository, according to Burmese tradition, of relics of the last four Budhas \u2014 viz. the staff of Kan thathon, the water-dipper of Gaunagon, a garment"], [40, "8 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT of Kathapa, and eight hairs from the head of Gau dama. Burman pagodas, it may be observed, are not temples, but monuments erected to the memory of Gaudama, and they are all supposed to contain sacred relics, and consequently are objects of worship to the Budhist. The Golden Pagoda rears its lofty head from a beautiful grove of Palmyra and cocoa palms and mango trees, but it is not a very symmetrical structure, the base being far too large and the shaft too massive to secure an elegant effect. What is justly termed ' the great bell ' of Eangoon k hung in a gaily ornamented pavilion near the large pagoda. I stood upright under it with perfect ease, and a dozen men might have stood there Avith me. The bell has a long inscription in the Burman character, eulogistic of the king who presented it, cut around its circumference. Hopes are expressed that for this meritorious gift, replete with the virtue of beneficence, he (the king who presented the bell) may be conducted to Nieban (the Budhist heaven), and obtain the de stined blessing of men, nats (genii), and Brahmas by means of divine perfection, and that he may also obtain in his transmigration only the regal state among men and nats.

BURMESE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS It is iioav generally believed that the Burmese, and indeed all the various races and nations of Indo-China, migrated at a remote period from the plateaus of Central Asia, and that they are of mixed origin, pos sessing some of the characteristics of the Hindoo (the Caucasian) and some also of the Chinaman (the Mongol). Thus in person they are short and stout, with the small, oblique eyes, high and prominent cheek bones, and flat, short, and broad nose of the Tartar, Chinese, and Japanese races, and the ' raven black ' hair, pearly teeth, and olive-brown skin of the Hindoos and the Malays ; and though of nearly the same stature as the latter, they generally possess the stouter frames of the former. The Burmese are a simple-minded, indolent people, frank and courteous, fond of amuse ment and gay-coloured apparel, friendly among them selves and hospitable to strangers. They appreciate a quiet life, smoking, and gossiping, and sleeping"], [44, "12 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT throughout the day, and listening to Avild music and singing through half of the night ; ' stern ' ambition is among them, indeed, a very rare trait of character. Burmese houses are built of teak wood, palm leaf, bamboo, rattan, and grass ; and are generally raised upon piles four or five feet from the ground, as a pre servative against fevers, bred by the great dampness of the climate, and to provide against the inundations of the rainy season. Native villages often consist of but one long and broad street, running through perfect jungles of date, banana, palm, or other tropical trees ; and beneath and among these, nearly concealed from view, are the little bamboo huts, artfully carved monasteries, and tapering pagodas. The costume of the Burmese is remarkably simple. Both sexes wear a short white jacket, called an engie ; and the male a putso (a piece of silk or cotton cloth, usually the former), and of gay colour (red or yellow), about a yar.d in Avidth, and four or five in length, Avhich is Avorn round the hips ; Avhile the Avomen wear a temine, which is a nearly square piece of cloth, or silk, sufficiently large to wrap around the body, but fastened merely by tucking the outer end Avithin the other, and consequently it gapes open at every step taken by the Avearer, and discloses nearly the Avhole of"], [45, "13 BURMESE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS one leg ; but this exhibition, being ' the custom,' is not deemed immodest.

The men seldom or never Avear any hair upon then slices, unless it might be a very feeble moustache. The sexes generally Avalk barefooted, though the women sometimes wear a sort of leather sandal, made after the classical Eoman model. The Burmese males are all tattooed from above the hips to the knees Avith a blackish-blue pigment, and some besides have punctured spots upon the upper part of the body stained a vermilion colour. This tat tooing of the thighs is a painful operation ; it is done when they are very young, a little at a time, and opium is often administered on such occasions, and deaths from an overdose of this drug, or from inflammation, are not infrequent. Eegarding this curious custom of tattooing the body of the males, and of the immodest dress of the females, an old traveller in Burma states that, ' the men of this nation have a singular custom of tattooing their thighs, which is done by wounding the skin and then filling the wound Avith the juice of certain plants, Avhich has the property of producing a black stain. Some, besides both their thighs, will also stain their legs of the same colours, and others paint them all over with representations of tigers, cats, and other animals.

The food of the Burmese is both simple and whole some. The general food of the nations of southern and eastern Asia is rice. Of the Burmese Ave may say that salt fish, rice and ngapee, and fruits constitute the solid and substantial part of their bill of fare, while betel-nut and the cheroot make quite an enjoyable dessert. The condiment ngapee, for which there is a very great demand, is made of preserved fish, fish Avhich has arrived at that epicurean stage termed ' high : ' it is a sort of paste which mixes with rice like the Indian sauce, chutnee. The betel-nut is extensively used, and most houses have about or near them trellises of the piper-betel plant, which is chewed with the nut. Smoking is universal and continual among both sexes and all ages ; cheroots of solid tobacco, but more often a preparation covered Avith a green-leaf wrapper, and some of them of enormous size, are used. Burmese boys take to smoking even earlier than do"], [48, "16 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT the youths of this country. I have frequently seen babes at their mothers' breast alternating the nourish ment of ' Nature's Nile ' Avith pulls and puffs at their cheroots. The natives of Burma do hot appear to wear so much jeAvellery as the Hindoos, but they delight espe cially in ear ornaments. The lobe of the ear is bored to a hole of astonishing size \u2014 often an inch in diameter \u2014 and in it various articles are Avorn : pieces of wood, jeAvels, or rolls of solid gold or silver. When no ornaments are in the ears, the men often put their cheroots, or any small article in frequent use, through them, and the women use them as bouquet- holders or flower-stands, thus presenting a very comical appear- ance. Burmese laAVs on the Avhole seem wisie, and evidently are calculated to advance the interests of justice and morality ; but they very often prove futile, owing to the tyranny and rapacity of the king and the venality of many of his officers.

It is written from left to right, with no division between the words, and with letters most of which are circles or parts of circles.

And Budhism is, without doubt, the most extensively diffused religion of the world \u2014 its followers numbering more than three hundred millions \u2014 though it has never been extended beyond the limits of Asia and its adjacent islands. The Burmese burn their dead, as do the Hindoos. The bodies of the priests are first embalmed, and then publicly burned with great demonstration. Having seen all of interest in Eangoon, I determined to make an excursion up the great IrraAvaddy river, as far as Mandalay, the capital of Ava, to pay my respects to His Majesty the King. One of a large flotilla of English steamers runs monthly to Bahmo, nearly a thousand miles from Eangoon, and there are weekly trips as far up as the capital.

UP THE IRRAWADDY Owing to the shallow water we could not ascend the Eangoon river in order to enter the Irrawaddy, but were compelled to go by the Bassein Creek, and then through another called the China Bakeer, a narrow but deep stream, with low, jungle-clad banks. We had an excellent breeze during the day and through part of the night, until early morning, when so dense a fog enveloped us that the captain dropped anchor and awaited daylight, before effecting which, however, the vessels grounded near the bank, but managed after a Avhile to work off the sandy bottom. At the breakfast table I noticed that the European passengers were eight in number, viz. three young ladies who were going to Thayet-myo, to see some relatives in the can tonments ; a young married couple just out from England, who had taken passage to Mandalay \u2014 the gentleman was a mining engineer and under engage ment Avith the King to prospect and bore for coal in"], [54, "22 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT Ava \u2014 an assistant Avho accompanied him to the capital ; and two English officers who Avere going to canton ments at Thayet-myo. Then, as ' upper deck ' passen gers, there was a company of English troops, and, as ' lower deck,' fully fifty Burmese, Chinese, Hindoos, and Mussulmans, who were 'booked ' for various toAvns along the river. The natives pay Es. 15 (a rupee is about 50 cts.) for passage to Mandalay, and provide their own food ; the cabin passengers (European) pay Es. 100, and Es. 4 per diem additional for the table. At noon on the second day from Eangoon we Avheeled into the great Irrawaddy- \u2014 the fourth river of the world in point of size, and the great higliAvay into the dominions of his ' golden-footed ' Majesty of Ava. The head of this celebrated river \u2014 styled ' IrraAvaddy,' from the elephant of Indra \u2014 has not yet been actually discovered. It is probably, however, in the Himalaya mountains, east of Tibet, and near the Brahmapootra. This would make the entire river \u2014 which flows southerly and debouches into the Gulf of Martaban, or Bay of Bengal, through nine large mouths and a perfect labyrinth of small ones\u2014 about 1,400 miles in length.

During a great part of the year the channel is very intricate and the current swift, but in May navigation is compa ratively easy, for in that month the river begins to rise, and so continues until, during July, its height above the lowest level will often be as much as forty feet. Tlie scenery of the river became more interesting as Ave proceeded. Sometimes for miles and miles we had in sight nothing but the gigantic ' elephant ' grass (so called from its being, Avhen in flourishing condition, tall enough to conceal an elephant) ; then Ave would have straggling villages \u2014 the huts made of bamboo framework and palm mats, and covered Avith grass roofs \u2014 and the people in gay-coloured garments Avould flock to the river's bank, aud squatting down upon their haunches, gaze curiously at the Avonderful fire boat and its ' barbarian ' passengers ; then followed a long reach of sandy or muddy beach ; then Ave Avould pass miles of bananas, growing so rankly as to re semble the common jungle ; and next a beautiful fringe of the richest green foliage skirting the Avater's edo*e.

I endeavoured to purchase a couple of small gilt images of Gaudama from a pongyee (priest), and offered a rupee in payment, but he either did not understand, or the offer Avas insufficient, or his religious scruples prevented the sale. The English authorities haATe built a brick market-house with an iron roof here for the accommodation and use of the natives. In it we saw an excellent variety of vegetables, fruits, and grains, also some few stalls containing dry goods.

Leaving Myanoung, we found the scenery improve still more. The high sand and mud banks which before had obstructed our view of the country inland now had disappeared, and we saw upon our left a low range of hills called the 'Arakan,' and upon our right plains covered with the densest of luxurious vegetation.

The Burmese have also long narrow canoes, made from the single trunk of a tree, which they paddle very dex trously and swiftly.

The Burmese men are remarkably indolent; the women, however, are industrious, but it is because the men compel them to do all the household work, at least the heaviest and most irksome part of it, and they will even sit about a place where their wives are at work, chatting and smoking, or else stretched upon the ground at full length asleep.

The hills round about were covered with custard apples, bananas, and many unknown plants. The fourth largest pagoda of Burma is situated in Prome ; a party from the steamer, in cluding myself, visited it. In general arrangements and character it resembles the Golden Pagoda at Ean goon ; some of the images of Gaudama and some of the bells (cast from a mixed sort of metal resembling bronze) were of fair model and most extraordinary Avorkmanship. The people evidently possess no small talent and ability for Easterns, but are too indolent to employ their faculties of mind or body in severer labour than eating, sleeping, chatting, and smoking. After our walk to the pagoda, which, situated upon a hill back of the town, is fully a hundred feet high, we visited several native huts, where the Avomen were Aveaving, upon primitive looms, silk cloth of various gay patterns, stripes of alternate colours being the most esteemed.

A day or two after leaving Thayet-myo we passed the steamer ' Nagpore ' on her downward passage. The captain of this vessel reported ' all quiet at the capital,' though disturbances had been feared for some time previously, and for the following reason : It seems the King had built a very fine tee, or gilt umbrella, as a gift for the great Shoay Dagon pagoda at Eangoon, and wished to send it down in grand state with an escort of 10,000 troops. To this the British Commissioner objected, reducing the number of the escort to 300 ; but afterwards political and prudential motives had induced him to forbid any escort at all to accompany the tee. This decision naturally irritated \u25a0> the King exceedingly, and grave fears of rebellion or riot were entertained by the European residents at the capital.

PAGIIAN AND THE OLD CAPITALS What is generally known by the term Burma com prises two distinct regions : British or Lower Burma, which is under English rule, and Upper Burma, or more properly Ava, under the dominion of a native sovereign. British Burma embraces the three divisions of Arakan, on the eastern shores of the Bay of Bengal ; Pegu, bordering on the Gulf of Martaban, on the south ; and the long and narrow strip of country styled Tenasserim, which extends to the Isthmus of KraAv on the Malay peninsula. These divisions of the country are some of the results of two wars which the English Government have waged Avith Burma. The first, in 1824, caused by some insults offered to the British flag by the Viceroy of Eangoon, was settled tAvo years later by ceding to the crown of England the provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim ; the other, concluded in 1853, and brought about by native out rages toAvards European merchants and aggressions upon British territory, resulted in the annexation of the rich"], [66, "32 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT province of Pegu to the already enormously extended Anglo-Indian empire in the east. So that at the present day King Mounglon has no sea-board : Ava is entirely inland. The Irrawaddy river still remains as an outlet for the produce of the kingdom, though passing through foreign territory. Proceeding up the river, we anchored on the 15th at the picturesque town of Yaynan-gyoung, with its long line of high-sterned fishing boats moored to the shore, and with scores of pagodas and temples crowning the neighbouring hill-tops for miles around. This town is noted for its export of earth-oil, or petroleum, so valu able to the Government as a source of revenue ; the Avells are situated about six miles distant from the river, and the oil is transported to this the nearest port in large earthen jars carried on carts drawn by bullocks, and then shipped to Eangoon. We received on board 3,000 baskets of paddy for the King at Mandalay, and the night was nearly spent before it was all shipped. The manner of loading Avas peculiar. Five large boats were rowed out from the shore in succession, and being made fast alongside, coolies carried the rice, in baskets holding sixty pounds each, upon their heads, and deposited it loose in the hold of our ' flat.'"], [67, "33 PAGHAN AND THE OLD CAPITALS The scenery was fast becoming dull and monotonous. The banks were of sand, and inland low and barren hills alone were to be seen. Pagodas and temples seemed to increase in number, and many zyats (free houses of rest for travellers) aho appeared. The ruins of Pagliah \u2014 a city founded over a thousand years ago \u2014 were an interesting study. No other signs of its former splendour now remain, however, than some pagodas and temples, a portion of very massive brick wall, and part of an old gateAvay. The ruins extend for eight miles along the bank of the river and two miles inland. The pagodas are of all sizes, shapes, and almost colours, and there are said to be nearly a thousand of them still standing. They are very massively built, the founda tions being of stone and the superstructure of brick and plaster. Many of them are square structures raised over vaults, where Budhist priests dwell ; then come several terraces gradually decreasing in Avidth, and a bell-shaped spire, or in some of them a slender dome, rises above all. In the temples are many images of Gaudama, some of them of Avhite alabaster and others of brick and plaster, painted red, and twenty feet in height. The various forms and contents of the pagodas and temples now remaining render it extremely doubtful D"], [68, "34 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT what people were formerly the builders or possessors of this ancient city of Paghan. Thus, besides the purely Budhistical monuments, there are statues bearing re markable resemblances to those of the Egyptian Eeti chism; others are of a Brahminical or Hindoo cha racter ; and some even, wonderful as it may seem, bespeak a Christian origin, or rather possess elements which have evidently been incorporated with the doc trines of Christianity. In support of this last statement I will quote the observations of a recent visitor at Paghan ; says the author, speaking of one of the ruined buildings, ' On either side of the entrance to this pagoda, at the summit of the steps above the dragons, were two small figures of priests standing in long gowns, with umbrellas over their heads. One of these figures AA'-as the very counterpart of the statue of an English archbishop of the Middle Ages ; and I was once before startled with a similar resemblance in a life- A sized image of the same character, covered with gold mixed with black, near the foot of the staircase in the rooms of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta. More over, the umbrella over the little archbishop bore a remarkable similarity to the small circular roof over the pulpit of an English cathedral, which is popularly sup posed to serve as a sounding board. Other resem-"], [69, "35 PAGHAN AND THE OLD CAPITALS blances, including the ground plan of most of the temples, Avhich is shaped like a cross after the manner of European cathedrals, have induced some missionaries to presume that these buildings have a Christian origin, This idea seems someAvhat preposterous. It is far more likely that there is a Budhist element in the Christ ianity of the dark ages, of which monasticism evidently forms a part, just in the same Avay that there is a great deal of Platonism in the early Fathers.' Just after leaving Paghan the bank rises in a high sandstone bluff, and cut in the almost inaccessible face of this Avere many small openings Avhich led to equally small chambers within, Avhere some ascetic priests had taken up their abode. The next town Ave reached Avas called Tsagaing. It lies at the foot of some beautiful hills which are almost covered with pagodas, temples, griffins, and long, winding staircases. Some of the stone staircases, leading from the little town to the pagodas on the tops of the hills, were as much as half a mile in length. Before reaching Ava we no ticed on the left bank of the river an immense bell shaped pagoda. It was built after the Mussulman model found in India, and reminded me strongly of some of the tombs which are to be seen in the old cities near Delhi. This pagoda is esteemed very holy, and d2"], [70, "36 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT once a year a great mala, or religious festival of dif ferent nations, is held in its honour. Ava, formerly the capital, and built on an island, is now only a miserable village, though the massive ruins still standing attest its former splendour. The ancient city wall, sixteen feet high and ten feet thick, formerly enclosed six or seven miles of buildings. Ava was very famous for its silk manufacture in olden times. Amarapoora, which was also at one time the metropolis of Burma, and contained 175,000 inhabitants, was but dimly seen on the left bank of the river, six miles east of Ava. The Burmese have been accustomed to change their capital rather frequently for many years back ; this was owing, sometimes, to revolution ; again to royal caprice, or superstition, or else change of dynasty. Thus Ava was first made capital A.D. 1364 ; nextMonchobo (about 1740) was used as the seat of government by King Alompra (surnamed ' the Great,' though a man of low birth, who having first driven the Talains out of Pegu, caused himself to be proclaimed king, then built a palace at Dagong, changing its name to Eangoon, made a treaty with the English, and established a new dynasty \u2014 that at present on the throne), it being his native town ; then, in 1782, the court was removed to Amara poora; in 1819 the government Avas changed back to"], [71, "37 PAGHAN AND THE OLD CAPITALS Ava, the reigning king being thus advised by the court astrologers.

Mandalay is but a few miles above Amarapoora, on the same bank of the river. On the 18th we anchored at the port or landing of the ' golden city,' and so safely reached the proposed limit of my excursion north from Eangoon."], [72, "38 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT CHAPTER V. MANDALAY All that can be seen of the city of Mandalay from the river is a confused mixture of spires, and towers, and temple-tops appearing above the rich masses of foliage Avith which it is thickly surrounded. We anchored at twelve o'clock by the side of a dreary sandbank, with some fine large trees a httle distance inland, a feAV bamboo huts in sight, and the usual complement of dirty and curious natives squatting along the bank \u2014 the landing being three miles distant from the city.

His Majesty OAvns several others which are in the same predicament ; and, besides, he is build ing ten steamers of a larger size and better constructed \u2014 for what purpose I did not learn. These steamers lie upon the stocks in rows, and are covered with huge sheds ; they are being built of solid teak timber, and the work is done by the natives under the direction of"], [73, "VIEW OF THE CITY OF MANDALAY"], [74, "BUDHIST MONASTERY"], [75, "41 MANDALAY Hill,' covered with monasteries and bell towers. During a great part of the year this plain is inundated with water, and then for locomotion the natives are com pelled to betake themselves to canoes and rafts in lieu of ponies and bullock-carts. Mandalay is a new city ; as recently as 1855 the area noAv thickly peopled was merely farm land ; building began the following year, and the Court have resided there since 1857. The houses in the suburbs of Mandalay do not at all differ from those in any of the villages seen along the river ; they are simple, frail structures of bamboo framework and mat covering, with grass or palm-leaf thatched roofs, and are raised some four or five feet from the ground upon wooden piles, as a precaution against inundations, dampness, fevers, and dysentery. This loAver story is sometimes used as a stable for the domestic animals. In the principal streets of the suburbs the majority of the houses are either built of brick or large bricks are nailed to the timbers and sidings, and then the whole exterior is thickly plastered with linie or mud. Some of the Chinese shops are two stories in height; these present a very neat and tidy appearance. Numbers of pagodas and temples and kyoungs (schools or monas teries) were seen in all directions. As many of the"], [76, "42 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT houses are built of verv inflammable material, and are crowded so closely together, and as the natives are so apathetic and phlegmatic, a fire becomes a terrible scourge. One occurred several weeks before my visit, and destroyed about five thousand houses ; our road led through the burned district, and the desolate picture there presented was fearful to behold. The ground was covered with the charred and blackened remnants of huts and household goods, the dead trees were heaped about and still smoking, and, as if to heighten the mournful spectacle, here and there, at considerable intervals, might be seen little mat hovels Avhich had just been erected by some of the sufferers, who had saved only enough to shelter themselves from the scorching mid-day sun. At last we halted before a plain brick house built much in the European style ; and, dismounting, I was cordially welcomed by the Chinaman, who, after he had examined my present for the King \u2014 a large magni fying glass, Avith a bright gilt rim and an ivory handle \u2014 and pronounced it both novel and appropriate, ordered his own pony to be brought, and then we rode at once to the palace \u2014 distant about a mile and a half from his residence. By the wayside I noticed a large image of Gaudama (the last Budha), which had its head protected"], [77, "43 MANDALAY from the sun by a broad-brimmed and peaked-crowned Chinese hat ; the picture produced by the smiling, gilt faced god shaded by such a curious head-gear was most ludicrous. There are several Asiatic nations represented in Mandalay, the population of which is about a hundred thousand, but the Chinese, dwelling mostly in the suburbs and southern parts of the city, have the greater part of the trade in their hands ; the Europeans, living in the western quarter, all told, number but fourteen, some of them being officials of the English Govern ment and a few being engaged in trade. The city proper is a square \u2014 a mile on each side \u2014 and is surrounded by a lofty and very thick wall of loose brick (unplastered) with a notched parapet, and having a broad and deep moat filled Avith clear water. There are three gates on 'each side, and macadamised streets about a hundred feet in width, leading from them, intersect the city at right angles ; then between these there are small and irregular streets and by-paths. Along the sides of the larger avenues there run channels for carrying water (which is brought from the river in a canal fifteen miles long) throughout the city. Each gateway is surmounted by a lofty pyramidal-shaped Avooden tower with the customary terraced roof, and"], [78, "44 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT at irregular intervals there are turrets raised a little higher than the wall and surmounted by small wooden pavilions of the same model as those over the great gates. We crossed the moat on a massive wooden bridge, and passed through one of the western gate ways \u2014 the only one through which corpses are allowed to be taken from the city, as my guide observed. The gates are of enormous height and thickness, and are built of teak beams fastened together with huge iron bolts. A few half-naked soldiers, who were stationed as a guard just within the entrance, saluted us by squatting on the ground in true native fashion. On reaching the palace we left our ponies and proceeded on foot, entering through the south gate. The outer palace walls are double, the one being thirty feet distant from the other ; both are built of brick, and enclose about seventy-two acres of ground. The western gate is strictly set apart for the use of the ladies of the Court ; near the one at which we entered were some barracks and a guard-house, before which latter, standing in a row, were five of the King's soldiers. They wore brass hats, shaped somewhat like a broad brimmed ' panama,' with griffins in front ; red coats, with green facings (British army pattern) ; their legs and feet were bare ; and their only weapon consisted of"], [79, "THE TALACE, MANDALAY"], [80, ""], [81, "MANDALAY 45 an immense dah, an instrument shaped precisely like our butchers' cleavers, and which they held over their shoulders in a most laughable serio-comic manner. It is not always, indeed, that the Burmese soldiers adopt even so much uniform as this ; their profession can often only be known by a tattooed mark on the back of the neck. Walking into the square, which was filled with natives of all ranks passing in every direction, I saAV upon the right a small pagoda, farther on a bell tower, and in the left-hand corner a magazine and some buildings filled with light ordnance ; next came the ' High Court,' and then the ' Royal Mint,' while towering high above all rose the graceful spire of the magnificent 'Hall of Audience.' In a small building, or rather shed (for it was a very plain bamboo affair, and contained no furniture, carpets, or vessels of any kind), near the High Court-house, was the Pakhan Mengyee, or Foreign Minister, and upon him we made our first call. The shed was entirely open on the front side, and there a low bamboo platform was placed ; and upon this we sat, and taking off our shoes and leaving them underneath (agreeably to Burmese etiquette) we walked in a rather humble manner into the diplomatic office and sat, or more properly lay, down upon the floor on our hips, with the"], [82, "46 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT feet thrust far to the rear, for the soles of the feet must never be shoAvn when' in the presence of a superior. The Pakhan Mengyee Avas taking his breakfast, but he at once entered into conversation with my Chinese cicerone concerning my nationality, age, business, travels, &c. This gentleman, whose rank is only se cond to members of the royal family, appeared to be upwards of sixty years of age ; he had a rather sinister and crafty countenance and a very pompous and con ceited manner. The minister was plainly dressed, with his hair ' put up ' in a knot and a white handkerchief twisted into a coil and bound once round his head, the two ends left out and appearing just above the hair, like the war plumes of a North American Indian. I afterwards noticed that all the Government officials and clerks wore this style of turban or head-dress, instead of the usually seen vari-coloured bandanna. Leaving the Foreign Office, we passed round the Hlot-daw, or ' High Court ' \u2014 a large but not imposing building, painted red, with gilt ornamental work ; and in which the four principal Woongyees, or ministers of the King, sit to adjudicate all appeal cases \u2014 and were about to enter, through a double line of walls, the enclosure which contains the palace buildings, AAThen our attention was attracted by a regiment of native Burmese"], [83, "47 MANDALAY soldiers, Avho had been out at target practice. They marched by us in column, four deep, clothed in nothing but the doty (waist cloth), and carrying huge old fashioned muskets, closely resembling the historic blunderbuss of the sixteenth century. Judging from the appearance of these troops I should say that a thoroughly, equipped European soldier would be a match for at least ten of them, and yet it has been said that the Burman soldier fights well under favouring circumstances. But the chief excellence of a Burman army lies in the absence of the impedimenta; the sol dier carries his bed (a mat or blanket) at one end of his matchlock, a package of poAvder and a brass kettle at the other, and his provisions (rice, salt, and the half putrid fish condiment called ngapee) in a cloth about his waist. After a few words with the ' Captain of the Guard,' who showed me some ' Schneider ' rifles recently imported, we entered the square which contains the temporal abode of the ' Lord of Earth and Air.' Near the centre of this enclosure is the imposing ' Hall of Audience,' which is only used on great or solemn occa sions, as for the reception of foreign ambassadors or the celebration of royal fetes. The building consists of a lofty tower, with terraces of little roofs rising one above the other, and crowned by the gold umbrella in"], [84, "48 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT the centre, and two smaller ones on each wing, over a long central court or hall (both also in the many-roofed style of Burmese architecture), and the whole gaudily painted in red and gold and covered with ornate carvings and decorations of brass, china, and glass. In front of the grand staircase are two immense cannon, mounted on primitive carriages having solid wooden ' block ' wheels. On the right hand were barracks, a carriage foundry, and the royal gardens ; while on the left were ordnance stores, the abode of the ' Avhite elephant,' a building filled with canoes, and some sheds containing war and work elephants \u2014 these latter black. We then called at the office of the Prime Minister, Avhom we found, Avith his assistant, discussing a whole some breakfast. The food for each was brought by servants in four or five little bowls placed upon trays, and they ate with their fingers, taking something from each bowl in turn. The meal embraced vegetables and fish, rice, ngapee, greens, and spices ; water only, from wooden cups, was drunk during the breakfast. My Chinese friend here learned that the King had just terminated his first ' audience,' and so I Avould have to wait nearly two hours, and then attend the second. During this time he introduced me to some other of"], [85, "49 MANDALAY the Government officials, with all of whom he seemed to be on most excellent terms. The conversation with all of them was similar to that held Avith the Foreign Minister, except one with the Yaw- Ahtween- Woon, or Minister of the Interior, who was singularly and not altogether politely curious, asking such embarrassing questions as how much money I expended in travelling, what business my father did, Avhat I was travelling for, and why I did not settle down somewhere. His Ex cellency imagined I must be traATelling for political purposes, and could not comprehend any other motive for visiting foreign countries. He was a middle-aged man, a thorough politician of the unscrupulous sort, and I doubt not exceedingly cunning ; but yet it appears he had quite recently been forbidden by the King to transact any further business Avith Europeans, owing to some discrepancies in the official returns, and his duties and powers had been transferred for the time to one of the royal secretaries. Near the office of the Minister of the Interior I saw a half-dozen men who Avere shackled with their hands behind them, and exposed, bare-headed, to the noon-day rays of the sun ; they Avere prisoners for debt, and Avould be held in ' durance vile ' until some friend advanced sufficient funds to satisfy the just claims of their creditors. E"], [86, "50 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT At the Yaw-Ahtween-Woon's office I met a very intelligent young Burman, who had studied in Paris, spoke French fluently and English fairly ; his Burmese title being Pangyet Woon, or ' Governor of the Glass Manufactories' \u2014 a rather irrelevant appellation, for there are no such manufactories in Ava. I conversed with him nearly an hour, and obtained much valuable infor mation concerning his country and countrymen and women. In a small pamphlet published in Rangoon (November 1870) I found the following account of this talented native gentleman, which presents a notable, though not unique, example of the capabilities and intelligence of the higher class of Burmese youth \u2014 the nobles : ' At eighteen years of age he was sent by the late CroAvn Prince to Calcutta, to be educated in Enghsh at Doreton College. After four years' resi dence at Calcutta this young Burmese gentleman returned to Mandalay, and during the voyage he made the acquaintance of Count de Lacy, who was a pas senger on board the steamer, and could speak English. After staying a few months at Mandalay the King was induced by his French proclivities to send the young Burman to Paris, in charge of the Count, to study French. After acquiring the language he studied sciences for five years at the institution known as the"], [87, "51 MANDALAY Pantheon, and here he took the degrees of both Bachelor and Master of Arts. Finally he studied for three years at the Central Imperial School of Arts and Manufactures, and obtained a diploma. His career in Europe was brought to a close by the re bellion in 1866, in which the Crown Prince Avas slain, and early in 1867 he Avas recalled to Mandalay by the King.' In addition to his duties as one of the royal secretaries, he had been appointed to sit with the Political Agent (English) as judge of the mixed court at Mandalay. Well, indeed, would it be for King Mounglon Avere there more such as he at the Court of Ava! In one of the offices, a minor court, there seemed to be a great deal of business transacted, for there were as many as thirty or forty people Avaiting all the time ; each seemed to speedily finish his. errand, what ever it might have been, but more coming in kept the room continually full. In asking favours of an official the natives prostrate themselves upon their stomachs, clasp the hands as if in the act of worship, and scarcely dare to raise their eyes from the floor.

After remaining in the Court-room about twenty minutes an officer came with a message that the King was ready to give ' audience,' and so, pre- ceded by two of the grand ministers, we approached the Mhaw-gaw \u2014 the Crystal Palace \u2014 passing through still another gate in a Ioav brick wall. A huge elephant looked calmly at us from a red shed near the road, but we did not stop ; and soon after, leaving our shoes at the foot, mounted a long flight of stone stairs and entered another office, where our arrival was announced to His Majesty. While awaiting an answer I strolled into the ' Hall of Audience ' to see the throne. It is a flat, raised dais, perhaps eight feet square, richly gilded, and on either side are the white and gold silk umbrellas, symbols of royalty (it is said that umbrellas were a sign of rank in ancient Nineveh, and they are so esteemed by most Asiatic nations at the present day). The hall is gaily painted, and the ceiling is supported by enormous round teak pillars. Banquets, at which the table service is of pure gold and silver, are sometimes served here. In the rear of this building, and connected with it, are the minor audience chambers, one or the other being used at the humour of the King, and each being named from their"], [89, "53 MANDALAY peculiar style of decoration ; thus there is the ' Golden Palace,' which is entirely covered with gold (?), and the Mhaw-gaw, or ' Crystal Palace ' (already mentioned), and so called because it is adorned with trimmings in isinglass, porcelain, and glass \u2014 small mirrors."], [90, "THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT 54 CHAPTEE VI. AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF AVA After waiting five or ten minutes we were summoned to a small pillared portico, open on two sides. At our backs there was a golden door leading to another chamber, and before us was a large green baize curtain, extending from the ceiling to the floor of another room which was some few feet above us. In the centre of this screen was an opening about ten feet square ; here a red velvet cushion and a pair of silver-mounted binoculars were laid upon the floor, where there was an elegantly carpeted staircase connecting the two chambers. The roof was supported by immense pillars, grouped around the bases of two of which were the royal umbrellas and other insignia. No one save the King is allowed to possess a white umbrella, and princes of the blood are allowed to have two umbrellas (gilt, with poles ten or fifteen feet in length attached) carried above them by their servants when they walk or ride in public \u2014 ministers but one. There were"], [91, "AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF AVA 55 about half a dozen princes in the ' Audience Chamber,' among them the heir-apparent, an intelligent as well as handsome young man, plainly dressed, excepting a pair of immense cluster diamond ear-rings. Our party \u2014 for there were several others whom we found wait ing \u2014 was disposed in the following order : The princes sat upon the right, then came the Yaw-Ahtween-Woon, then another minister, then myself, next Mr. Seng-Ko, then two ex-ministers of the former King ; adjoining them were two Portuguese Eoman Catholic missionaries, and then two commercial gentlemen upon the extreme left ; besides these, in the rear, were some dozen or more clerks, who were paying their respects to His Majesty upon the receipt of new appointments, each offering a large basket of fruit in support of his loyal feelings. Our presents were displayed before us, placed on httle wooden stands about a foot in height. The natives -were all prostrating themselves flat upon their stomachs, with their noses nearly touching the carpets and their eyes cast down in a most abject and servile manner. In a few moments we heard two or three muffled booms \u2014 taps on a large tom-tom probably \u2014 and then all of us becoming at once silent, the King appeared, and quietly and slowly laid himself down, reclining"], [92, "56 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT against the velvet cushion and only partially facing the audience. At the same time one of the queens entered and placed a golden spittoon, betel-box, chatty (with water), and cup on the floor before him. The King is a short, stout, pleasant, though, hke many of his ministers, an exceeding crafty-looking gentleman, fifty-four years of age. His hair was thin and was tied in the usual Burmese knot ; the head was high at the crown, showing ' self-esteem,' large, and the eyes were closely set, indicating cunning (if we are to believe phrenology and physiognomy) ; the neck was thick, expressive of vitality and physical power, and the face close shaven, excepting a thin black moustache. His dress was very plain and simple, consisting merely of a white engie, a white linen jacket, and a silk putso, a cloth worn around the hips and thighs ; there were no ornaments in the ears, though their lobes contained holes nearly an inch in diameter, which did not improve the expression of his countenance very materially. His Majesty first took up his opera glass, though we were not more than twenty feet distant, and surveyed us in a very grave and leisurely manner, ending with a flourish of the glass, as if to say, ' Now, then, for business.' The royal secretary read aloud our names, business, and the list of the presents which were placed before"], [93, "57 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF AVA us ; this was done in a loud, drawling style, and con cluded with a sort of supplicating moan. His Majesty then began the conversation through the Minister and my Chinese friend as interpreters. After the usual questions concerning my age, business, residence, and travels, the King said he wished me to convey to my Government the sentiment that ' he had a great partiality for Americans, and wished them to come over and colonise in his dominions.' But a word preliminary : it seems that I had the honour to be the first American presented at the Court of Ava (excepting a mechanical engineer, who was in His Majesty's employ ten or twelve years ago), and that the King in his astuteness graciously thought me a spy, or at least that I was visiting Burma for political purposes, and consequently had some influence with as well as instructions from the Government at home. It was in vain that I protested being a simple traveller, visiting different countries for the purpose of studying their geography, climate, productions ; the people \u2014 their manners and customs, government, religion, laws, language, literature, industries, and commerce \u2014 and all for the improvement of mind and health of body, and that I had travelled about twelve thousand miles more especially to pay my respects to the King of Ava, and"], [94, "58 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT to see the wonderful white elephant, about which I had heard and read so much in my own country ; but to no purpose, for it was quite evident His Majesty thought politics were surely my main object and end. Promising to make his wishes known to the proper authorities at home did not seem to be alone sufficient for his purposes, for he said he would keep me in Mandalay while I wrote, and until an answer came from America. At this I demurred of course, when His Majesty said if I would remain he would give me a house, living, and as many Burmese wives as I wished (a rather tempting offer, for the women of the upper classes are both pretty and modest), and, furthermore, he would ' make my fortune.' I was fast becoming very much interested, and slightly ex cited as well. His Majesty wished to make also a commercial treaty with America, and my services would be indispensable. Thus were alluring nets spread for my feet and enticing temptations presented to me. Still I was not then prepared to enter the King's service ; the idea was too new and novel, the change \u2014 from republican America and steam ploughs to monarchical Burma and white elephants \u2014 too great. ' I must have time to consider His Majesty's gracious offers,' said I to the interpreter. 'You will never"], [95, "59 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF AVA have a better chance,' was returned from the King. Seeing me still reluctant, the King condescendingly offered to ' make me a great man ' \u2014 to give me high rank among his own nobles and princes. To this I answered my duty was first to my parents, and next to my own country, and that I would return to the latter and consult with the former, and then, if they were nulling, I would be most happy to accept his magnificent and unusually gracious terms. He replied, '\u2022 It might then be too late ; ' and there the matter dropped, and the conversation was changed to other topics, though the King was evidently not a little vexed at my obstinacy, and doubtless thought me mad or certainly very foolish not to accept such generous pro posals. One of the missionaries then presented some petitions, which were referred to the proper minister; some State business was transacted ; a present of Es. 100 was brought me (' to use for my travelling expenses or to purchase a memento of my presentation at the Court of \"His Golden-Footed Majesty'\"), and then the audience was terminated by the King suddenly rising and abruptly retiring from the room. One of his queens or concubines (he has four of the former and about a hundred of the latter) who, though out of sight, had been fanning the King with a gorgeous"], [96, "60 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT fan of peacock's feathers during the audience, now took a peep at us, of course exhibiting herself at the same time, and such a beautiful creature I have rarely looked upon before and perchance never shall see again. She was one of the veritable ' houris of Paradise,' an oriental pearl of indescribable loveliness and symmetry. I will not attempt a description ; but the King's liberal offers came at once to mind, and I felt what a great sacrifice it would be to return to my native land, and refuse \u2014 nay, almost spurn \u2014 rank, wealth, and beauty under the peacock banner and golden umbrella of His Majesty of Ava. The ' audience ' lasted over an hour. The King seemed to have very respectable ideas of America and a high appreciation of the (usually conceded) enterprise and industry of her people ; perhaps he wished Ameri cans to settle in Burma as a sort of political offset to the English, whose power \u2014 now owning two-thirds of ancient Burma \u2014 is naturally very great, but I think his main idea was simply to obtain from the United States a commercial treaty advantageous to himself. His Majesty's use of the binoculars, which he invariably employs in all audiences, is not altogether pleasant ; but the manner in which he would scan our coun tenances while replying to some of his commanding"], [97, "AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF AVA 61 speeches was most amusing. His voice is soft and low, and he speaks in a very deliberate manner, taking ample time to arrange his thoughts before giving them utterance. The present King is a son of the famous Tharawaddi ; his brother \u2014 the eldest legitimate son \u2014 assumed the government in 1845, but, proving a tyrant, was de posed and succeeded by King Mounglon in 1853. In 1857 he removed the capital from Amarapoora to Mandalay. The King, little thinking that he would ever attain the crown, had in early youth taken the vows of a phongyee, or Budhist priest, and lived se cluded in a monastery until his accession. Like his pre decessors his reign has not been without its troubles. In 1866 a rebellion broke out headed by two of the King's sons, the Mengon and Mengondyne princes, having for its object the dethronement of their father. The attempt failed, and the former is a refugee in the Shan States, while the latter resides under British pro tection in Bengal. As regards the events ofthe King's rule much might be said of blame and something also of praise. The Government is a despotism ; among many others we notice the royal title of ' Lord of the Power of Life and Death.' The Holt-daw (Council of State), composed of the four principal ministers of"], [98, "62 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT State, are the executive officers of the Government ; they also try all appeal cases, forming a high court for that purpose, and receiving ten per cent, of the property in suit, are said to derive very handsome incomes from this source alone. The tyranny and weight of the King's rule is most felt at, or in the immediate vicinity of, the capital, the remote districts being almost inde pendent, and paying but little more heed to the ruling monarch than to swear allegiance whenever visited by his officers. And so limited in extent of territory is the real power of the King that the people dwelling upon the borders of Yunan are said to acknowledge the sovereignty of the local rulers of the Emperor of China as well as those of the King of Ava, and so enjoy privileges from both Governments. At present there is a royal monopoly of the paddy (rice) and cotton and other leading products \u2014 marble, amber, gold, copper, coal, and guns above a certain size (all over Es. 100 in value). The King dare not leave his palace for fear of foul play, and he has consequently never seen his own war canoes or steamers, nor has he ever visited his new palace built near the river. The Government is ' rotten to the very core ; ' bribery and corruption reign paramount. The King appropriates most of the revenue ; many of his"], [99, "AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF AVA 63 ministers receive no salary at all ; and the King buys goods of merchants and serves them out as pay to his troops and followers, who afterwards have to sell them in the bazaars at half-price ; besides, the country bitterly suffers ' from the extortionate duties, from the grinding taxation, and from the cruelties and oppres sions that daily transpire (boys of tender years and infirm old men being flogged to death in the streets, or publicly crucified with a barbarity that beggars description), and from the guild of brokers, who rule the markets according to the orders of the King or his ministers, so that no one can buy or sell save through these brokers. And yet the King has shown some appreciation of the advantages of western civilisation. He offers good inducements to European mechanics and engineers to establish themselves in Mandalay. His Majesty has succeeded in bringing his country into telegraphic communication with India and Europe. The introduction of the electric tele graph into Burma is thus curiously described by my friend the Yaw-Ahtween- Woon (Minister of the In terior) : ' The present founder of the city of Mandalay or Eutuapon, Builder of the Eoyal Palace, Euler of the Sea and Laud, Lord of the Celestial Elephant and Master of many White Elephants, Owner of the"], [100, "64 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT Shekyah or Indra's Weapon, Lord of the Power of Life and Death, and Great Chief of Eighteousness, being exceedingly anxious for the welfare of his people, in the year 1231 introduced the telegraph, a science the elements of which may be compared to thunder and lightning for rapidity and brilliancy, and such as his royal ancestors in successive genera tions had never attempted.'

One of the proudest titles of the King of Ava is ' Lord of the White Elephant,' though the King of Siam at Bangkok is also the possessor of one or more of these sacred beasts. The Mandalay animal I found to be a male of medium size, with white eyes and a forehead and ears spotted white, appearing as if they had been rubbed with pumice-stone or sand paper, but the remainder of the body was as ' black as coal.' He was a vicious brute, chained by the fore legs in the centre of a large shed, and was surrounded with the ' adjuncts of royalty ' \u2014 gold and white cloth umbrellas, an embroidered canopy above, and some bundles of spears in the corners of the room. The attendants told me that a young one, captured in the north-eastern part of British Burma, near Tounghoo, had recently died, after a short residence in the v"], [102, "66 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT capital, and that the king had been 'out- of sorts' ever since. Tliis animal was suckled by twelve women, hired for the express purpose ; these elephant ' wet-nurses ' receiving Es. 50 per mensem, and thinking it a great honour to serve in such capacity. The white elephant, well named the Apis of the Budhists, has long been an appendage to Burman state. Mr. Ealph Fitch, who travelled through Burma about the year 1582, speaking of the king who reigned at that time, says, in his quaint, black-letter folio, that \" among the rest he hath foure white elephants, which are very strange and rare, for there is none other king that hath them but he ; if any other king hath one, hee will send vnto him for it. When any of these white elephants is brought vnto the king, all the merchants in the city are com manded to see them and to giue him a present of halfe a ducat, which doth come to a great summe, for that there are many merchants in the city. After that you have given your present, you may come and see them at your pleasure, although they stand in the king's house. The king, in his title, is called the king of the white elephants. If any other king haue one, and will not send it him, he will make warre with him for it, for he had rather lose a great"], [103, "67 THE WHITE ELEPHANT part of his kingdome than not to conquere him.

One of them, when he doth go to the riuer to be washed, as euery day they do, goeth under a canopy of clothe, of golde or of silke, carried ouer him by sixe or eight men, and eight or ten men goe before him, playing on drummes, shawmes (clarionets), or other instruments ; and when he is washed, and cometh out of the riuer, there is a gentleman which doth wash his feet in a siluer basin, which is his office giuen him by the king. There is no account made of any blacke elephant, be he neuer so great. And surely there be woonderful faire and great, and some be nine cubites in height.\" Again, in Father Sangermano's ' Description of the Burmese Empire,1 some two hundred years later, we have interesting accounts of the capture, transportation (to the capital), and more than royal treatment of the white elephant : how, when caught in the forests of Pegu, it was bound with scarlet cords and waited upon by the highest mandarins of the empire ; how the place where it was taken being infested with mosquitoes, a silken net was made to protect it from them ; how it was F 2"], [104, "68 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT transported to Amarapoora in a boat having a pavilion draped with gold-embroidered silk, and covered with a roof similar to those covering the royal palaces ; how, on its arrival in the city, a grand festival, continuing for three days, was celebrated in its honour ; and how the most costly presents were brought to it by the mandarins, one offering a vase of gold weighing 480 ounces. This animal was honoured no less at its demise than during life. Being a female, its funeral was conducted with the same forms and rites as those practised at the death of a queen. The body was burned upon a pile of sassafras, sandal, and other aromatic woods, the pyre being fired with the aid of four immense gilt bellows placed at its corners. Three days afterwards its ashes were gathered by the chief mandarins, enshrined in gilt urns, and buried in the royal cemetery. A superb mausoleum, of a pyramidal shape, built of brick, richly painted and gilt, was subsequently raised over the tomb. If this elephant had been a male, it would have been interred with the same ceremonial as that used for the sovereign. And even at this day the 'celestial' white elephants are still the objects of great veneration, royal favour, and attention ; aside from their divine character of (being) trans-"], [105, "69 THE WHITE ELEPHANT migrating Budhas, their possession, according to Burmese superstition, is considered to bring prosperity to the country in peace and good fortune in war, and therefore then* death is regarded as nothing less than a national calamity. At such times the entire nation shave their heads, and perform such deeds of sorrow and mourning as are customary on the loss of the nearest and dearest of their relatives. In one shed were some large gilded war-boats, and in another were the royal palanquins and carriages, all richly gilded, the former of fantastic and whimsical model, and the latter of English design, if not manu facture. The ' Eoyal Gardens ' we did not visit. They are said to be laid out in squares, crossed in different places by canals of brickwork, in which the water is seven fathoms in depth. The pathways run in every direction, and grottoes are thickly interspersed among them. We inspected the artillery sheds, and observed that most of the cannon were of small calibre and antique manufacture ; some of them were as much as twenty feet in length and scarcely more than four inches bore from muzzle to vent ; they had been captured from the Siamese. We next visited the ' Eoyal Herald's' office, and obtained a permit to take the present with which His Majesty had honoured me"], [106, "70 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT through the palace gates. This ' pass ' was simply a piece of prepared palm-leaf about five inches in length and a little more than one in width ; the order was an engraved intaglio (in ordinary Burmese circular cha racter), and in one corner was the King's Treasury stamp impressed on basso relievo. Strips of palm-leaf are also used by scholars. They usually write or engrave with a sharp iron instrument (a style) upon pieces about two feet long and two and a half inches broad, and with a number of these strips and two thin boards of the same size for covers they form their books. Having gained the street beyond the outermost wall, we remounted our ponies and rode to Mr. Seng-Ko's house. My host's pretty little Burmese wife then ' served up ' a very palatable tiffin (lunch), and over our cheroots and tea we discussed the events of the morning, the future of Burma, the present state of China, and the rapid rise and prospects of the Chinese population of San Francisco and California. Speaking of tea, this valuable commodity is raised, in small quantity, upon the northern hills, those bordering upon the province of Yunan, in China ; but the Burmese devote the leaf to a far different purpose from that employed by the surrounding nations and by om-"], [107, "THE WHITE ELEPHANT 71 selves. Instead of steeping the leaves and drinking the warm and refreshing decoction obtained therefrom, they make a sort of salad of them, together with garlic, adding some kind of oil and condiment. About three o'clock in the afternoon my obliging Chinese friend accompanied me on a walk through the bazaars and market, and to see the. King's war canoes. The bazaars were similar to those of Eangoon for variety and quality of goods, containing chiefly Chinese silks and British cloths, Bengal steel goods, checkered ban dannas, putsoes (cloths worn round the hips), earthen ware, porcelain, amber \u2014 sold for Es. 2 per pound in the capital \u2014 carved marble and wooden images of Gaudama, paper umbrellas and copper from China, &c. Here I obtained a complete collection of Burmese coins \u2014 made of copper, lead, pewter, silver, and gold. The silver coins have a copper ahoy of about fifteen per cent. Interest is very high \u2014 sixty per cent, per annum being sometimes charged. Much of the trade is carried on by means of barter, petroleum being the chief circulating medium; rice also is used as a money exchange in some parts of the country. The prices demanded seemed moderate, though a European is always, and perhaps justly, asked to pay more than a native. We saw some cotton"], [108, "72 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT goods of English manufacture and importation, which were sold cheaper even than the products of the domestic looms. The market was very large, and con- tained good varieties of vegetables and fish, but no meats. It consisted of about a hundred little bamboo sheds, built together, and the different articles were arranged in sections. It was a long walk to the war canoes, and made under a burning sun \u2014 therm. 112\u00b0 (Fah.)in the shade \u2014 but I felt amply repaid on behold- ing the curious navy belonging to the King. These canoes lie in a small creek which runs from the river up to the city. They are very long, with both prow and stern curling up high, and are paddled by forty men usually, sometimes sixty ; most of the boats are handsomely gilded on the outside and painted red within. A very fine barge, with decks and apartments, Mr. Seng-Ko pointed out as being used exclusively by the queens ; it is drawn or towed by war boats. The King's barge is the grandest of them all, but being too distant to observe minutely its construction, I give another description : ' This splendid vessel has been built on two large canoes, and is covered with the richest carving and gilding. This also, when used, will be drawn by war boats. In the centre is a lofty tower with eight or nine square storeys or terraces of black"], [109, "73 THE WHITE ELEPHANT and gold, surmounted by the tee, or umbrella. The prows of the two canoes on which this water palace is constructed consist each of an immense silver dragon ; and behind each dragon is the fierce colossal figure of a warrior deity called by the Burmese a Nat, but which is evidently identical with one of the Devatas of Hindoo mythology, of whom Indra is the special type. The stems of the canoes are beautifully adorned with a fretted work consisting of small pieces of looking-glass, which has a very rich appearance.' We returned to the house through the suburbs, and after a rest of half an hour I reluctantly took leave of the kind China man, who had devoted so much time to my service, entertaining me most hospitably at his own house, and rode back to the steamer, feeling rather exhausted, but much gratified at the novel and wonderful expe riences of the day."], [110, "THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT 74 CHAPTEE VIII. BHAMO AND THE OLD TRADE ROUTE At daylight the next morning we started to remeasure the seven hundred miles of water communication be tween Mandalay and Eangoon. The river Irrawaddy is navigable as far as Bhamo, three hundred miles above the capital, and a steamer runs there once a month. On an island somewhere in this part of the river there is a Budhist monastery where are some large tame fish fed regularly by the monks \u2014 which will come to the surface of the water at the simple cry of ' Tit-tit- tit.' They are said to be a large species of dog-fish, without scales, from three to five feet in length, and appear to consist. chiefly of head and mouth. They are exceed ingly voracious, and beg by the simple process of opening their huge jaws. These strange fish are so thoroughly domesticated as to freely permit anyone to stroke them on the back. The scenery from Mandalay to Bhamo is said to be very fine, the river passing through narrow mountain"], [111, "BHAMO AND THE OLD TRADE ROUTE 75 gorges, fertile lands, and by picturesque villages, pago das, and temples. Not far below Bhamo there is an especially striking and beautiful gorge or defile about fifteen miles in length. The river is there quite narrow, while the banks on either side rise to a height of five or six hundred feet, and are covered with grand old forests, which cast their dark shadows upon the smooth water. A huge rock \u2014 called ' Monkey Castle,' from the number of monkeys that hang about it \u2014 rising perpendicularly eight hundred feet above the surface of the river, is a noticeable feature of this wonderful defile. As the steamer slowly tugs along there is constant change in the view. Sometimes the river takes a winding course between the high and precipitous banks, with their dense green forests. At other places one comes upon a long vista of wood and stream. Here and there is a pagoda, or a village, or a few fishermen in a boat. The scene is not so much calcu lated to please and astonish the eye by wild sublimity, by rude precipices, as by graceful hills, glass-like water, and soft shadows. This part of Burma is much the richest in its natural productions ; the hills contain iron, coal, tin, copper, lead, gold, and silver \u2014 more than a million and a half dollars' worth of these two latter metals has been dug"], [112, "THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT 76 from the mines near Yunan, on the frontiers of China \u2014 sulphur, nitre, marble, and amber, and are covered (the hills) with valuable teak and oak timber ; the topaz, ruby, sapphire, amethyst, and other gems are found in the beds of rivulets ; while the valleys and plains offer, with mode rate cultivation (the soil being remarkably fertile), millet, maize, wheat, cotton, tobacco, and the sugar cane. The produce of earth-oil (petroleum) in wells, some of them three hundred feet in depth, along the banks of the Irrawaddy is very great, amounting to more than eight million pounds per annum. The old trade route between Burma and western China lay through Bhamo, but for the past twenty years it has been closed, owing to a rebellion in the province of Yunan (China). It appears that some Mussulman Chinese, called Panthays, suddenly broke out in rebel lion, defeated the Chinese authorities and troops sent against them, and established themselves in a separate colony, with Tali-foo for -their capital city and the residence of their king, who is styled ' Suleiman the First.' But although the Chinese cannot muster in sufficient force to put down these rebels, still they are continually harassing them, carrying on a ' dacoity war ; ' they devastate the country, keep the roads closed, and thus destroy commerce ; and not until the Panthay"], [113, "BHAMO AND THE OLD TRADE ROUTE 77 Government is acknowledged as actually established by the Emperor of China, and order and law are restored, will the old caravans with silks, cotton cloths, tea, earthenware, and ornamental articles find their way again down to Bhamo. Within the last ten years various parties have in vestigated, and some have surveyed, different trade routes between Burma and China ; but no further action has as yet been taken by the Burman Government than to subsidise a monthly line of steamers to Bhamo, from which place to the Shan States on the frontiers of China, the distance is about fifty miles 'as the crow flies.' One of the in tended lines of overland communication between Burma and China is deserving of passing attention. It has been proposed to build a railway from Eangoon, four hundred miles, to a town called Kiang-hung on the great Makong river, from which the distance is only about twenty miles to the borders of Yunan. But it seems this could hardly prove a success ; for were the route opened, then there would be the competition of easier and of course cheaper communication by water with Saigon and the French settlements; still the rail way may yet be built, and at no very distant day. It is quite as feasible a project as many others of like"], [114, "78 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT nature which have been undertaken in different coun tries of Asia. India, among many other countries, has one continuous road extending from Calcutta to Peshawur, on the confines of Afghanistan, which is more than sixteen hundred miles in length ; and already we hear of railroads in the islands of Java and Japan. Bhamo itself is described as being a very ordinary looking village, containing some four or five thousand inhabitants \u2014 Chinese, Shans, and Burmese. An English assistant political agent resides there, and is, I believe, the only European in the town. The former trade of Bhamo \u2014 silks, woollens, and cotton \u2014 was carried on principally by . the Chinese, who arrived there from Yunan in large caravans during the months of Decem ber and January. \" Under existing circumstances Bhamo has been dwindling away. History has repeated here in this remote quarter precisely what has befallen the great cities of the ancient world. When the Eomans obtained possession of the Mediterranean trade, Tyre and Sidon passed into nothingness; when the land route through the Arabian desert was abandoned for the water route through the Eed Sea, Petra and Edom became a howling wilderness. Whether Bhamo is to become a mere fishing village, or is once again to become an emporium of trade, depends upon whether"], [115, "BHAMO AND THE OLD TRADE ROUTE 79 the Panthays and Chinese can become friendly neigh bours.\" There have been but few trips made by the English steamers, and no goods, excepting some cottons, have as yet passed either way. By the contract the steamers are obliged to carry down to Eangoon fifty deck passengers (emigrants) free of charge ; on our passage we had fifty-three of them. They were all Shans or Laos, and were much fairer in complexion and stouter and stronger in body than the Burmese ; more over they spoke a different language. The Laos race \u2014 estimated at 1,500,000 in number \u2014 inhabits a great part of the interior of the Hindoo- Chinese peninsula, and is divided into numerous tribes, some of which are subject to the Emperor of China, some owe a sort of dubious allegiance to the Kings of Ava, or Siam, or Annam, while very many are politi cally independent, being only under the government of their patriarchal chiefs. The Laos are a quiet, peaceable, and indolent people. They cultivate the soil, confining their attention chiefly to rice, though tobacco and sugar cane and some vegetables are also grown ; they manu facture beautifully lacquered wares, gold and silver ornaments, and silk for home consumption ; they are also expert miners, their territory abounding in gold, silver, iron, and copper. The Laos tributaries of the"], [116, "80 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT Kin\" of Ava export many cattle to Mandalay \u2014 these are small but useful, being strong and docile. The Ava Government adopts a rather curious though quite effec tual (as it proves) method of compelling obedience from their Laos dependants. It seems that the latter are indebted to the former \u2014 their rulers \u2014 for so great a necessity of diet as suet, and the moment one of their chiefs proves refractory the supply is withheld until he shall implicitly yield what is enjoined. In going down the river we stopped first at the town of I sagaing, and took on board 1,000 baskets of grain (coarse peas, usually food for cattle), 1,000 baskets of wheat, and 200 hides. An amusing fact is connected with the hide trade. The Burmese 'are strictly forbidden by their religion to kill bullocks, cows, or calves ; and yet, the captain tells me, some times as many as 5,000 hides are shipped at a time from one town. Besides, the King had even recently forbidden the European residents at Mandalay to slaughter any cattle within the royal dominions. Late in the afternoon we stopped at a small village called Shoay-Ponk-Bew, and remained there during the night, lading 2,500 baskets of grain, and on the following day we completed our cargo by receiving on board, at one village, 200 bales of loose and pressed"], [117, "BHAMO AND THE OLD TRADE ROUTE 81 cotton and 315 bags of cutch (a resinous product from which a valuable dye is manufactured), and at another village 900 baskets more of grain. The steamer remained about six hours at Thayet myo, and I embraced the opportunity to visit the English cantonment, stationed on the very frontier. It is nearly a mile from the native village, is well laid out, with good roads, and the barracks are built of wood, with shingle roofs, and are raised from the ground on brick, or stone, or plaster piles. The term of service for troops stationed here is usually four years. There is a small fort at Thayet-myo, which would be much strengthened were some works erected on the opposite side of the river, and to forward this project General Norman \u2014 the military member of the Viceroy's Council \u2014 had been recently sent from Calcutta. The General, returning home, became our fellow-passenger as far as Eangoon. He mentioned meeting the Hon. William H. Seward on the occasion of his recent visit to Calcutta (when making tlie tour of the world), and spoke very highly of the superior abilities and cordial affability of our renowned and venerated patriot and statesman. On several evenings during the downward passage, our steamer was struck by furious squalls of wind, the G"], [118, "82 THE LAND OF .THE \"WHITE ELEPHANT rain sidling in torrents, but unaccompanied by either thunder or lightning. These squalls were the har bingers of the change of monsoon \u2014 from north-east to south-west in May \u2014 and after this change the rainy season commences, and continues for four or five months. It had been my intention to go from Eangoon to Maul main, and thence to travel overland to Bangkok in Siam. The latter trip is neither difficult nor long. There is a ' pass ' through the Shan mountains (none of the peaks of which rise above 8,200 feet in height), and ele phants, ponies, and guides are easily procured. Leaving the Shan mountains behind, one soon arrives at the Mek long river, where communication is easy with Bangkok by boat, down the stream, and then fifty miles on a canal ; or one might travel nearly due east from Maulmain until the great Menam was reached, and then sail down this rapid stream, by the ancient capital of Ayathia, to the modern capital, with its thousands of floating houses and hundreds of graceful pagodas. But this is a trip which, though easily possible from November to April, still would be almost impossible during the remaining months of the year, for sometimes as many as ten and even twelve inches of rain fall during one day in that part of Burma. We stayed four hours at Prome \u2014 a town which re-"], [119, "83 BHAMO AND THE OLD TRADE ROUTE sembles Mandalay in many respects. Prome was tlie seat of government for nearly five hundred years, but none of the Burmese kings have resided there since 1,000 B.C. Nothing more of interest occurred on our downward voyage. We reached Eangoon on the 28th inst., just three weeks from the date of my departure ' up the Irrawaddy ' for Mandalay. G 2"], [120, "84 THE LAND OF THE \"WHITE ELEPHANT CHAPTEE IX. FROM MAULMAIN AND PENANG Another week, passed in the chief city of British Burma, was made very pleasant for us by the good offices of the several residents we had first met as strangers, but whom we afterwards came to recognise as kind friends, and then we took passage in the British India Steam Navigation Co.'s steamer ' Mahratta,' 500 tons burden, Captain Lang in command, for Singapore, intending to stop at the towns of Maulmain, Penang, and Malacca on the passage. We were but twenty hours in descending the Eangoon river, crossing the bight of the Gulf of Martaban, and sighting the thickly wooded promontory beyond the little village of Amherst, which latter was formerly the capital of the Tenasserim provinces, but is now only used as a pilot station. Near Amherst may be seen the lonely grave of Mrs. Judson, the devoted missionary and wife, shaded by a single beautiful hopea tree. We had entered the Salween river \u2014 one of the largest in that remote part"], [121, "FROM MAULMAIN AND PENANG 85 of the world \u2014 and a rapid run of twenty-seven miles brought us to Maulmain, and we dropped anchor abreast of the business quarter of the town, with but a half-dozen small vessels in sight. The town does not appear to advantage from the river, almost hidden as it is by immense groves of the cocoa-nut and betel nut palm, banana, papaya, bamboo, and other tropical plants. The population, comprising Burmese, Chinese, Parsees, Armenians, Klings, Jews, and Cingalese, is about 10,000 ; the European residents may number less than a hundred. There are many large timber-yards at Maulmain ; indeed, it has always been famed for its export of teak logs which are cut in the forests upon the banks of the Salween, and then floated, sometimes hundreds of miles, down to the capital. In these timber-yards the usefulness, power, sagacity, and docility of the elephant is most wonderfully illustrated, for these uncouth monsters are employed in drawing, stacking, and shifting the immense teak logs \u2014 some of them weigh ing as much as two tons. A log that forty coolies could scarcely move the elephant will quietly lift upon his tusks, and holding it there with his proboscis, will carry it to whatever part of the yard he may be directed by his driver. They will also, using trunk, feet, and"], [122, "THE LAND OF THE WIHTE ELEPHANT 86 tusks, pile the huge timbers as evenly and correctly as one could wish.

It usually requires a year or a year aud a half to teach them the ' lumber business,' and when thoroughly taught they are worth from Es. 500 up wards, according to their abilities. We saw one, a venerable old fellow nearly ten feet in height, for which the owner said he had refused an offer of Es. 3,000. Sometimes an animal breaks his tusks, being forced to carry an excessive weight by a stupid or brutal driver; though the elephant knows his own power, and generally refuses to lift more than his tusks can safely bear, for if these should be broken off close to the head, death would soon ensue ; if only cracked they are hooped about with iron bands, and are thus rendered serviceable for many years. On leaving Maulmain our course was nearly due south. We saw, though dimly, some of the islands of the Mergui Archipelago, belonging to the British, and the island of Junk Ceylon, which has extensive tin mines, and which exports the famous edible birds' nests, eaten as a luxury by the Chinese. Soon after ward we obtained glimpses of the Malay peninsula \u2014 the Golden Chersonese of the ancients. The sea life of our Chinese passengers was to us a diverting spectacle, and oreatly relieved what would otherwise have been a rather monotonous voyage. Some of them were"], [124, "88 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT ' saloon ' passengers, and ate at our table. They wore the orthodox blue shirt and baggy trousers, slippers and ' pigtails,' and long finger-nails \u2014 one gentleman in particular had these useful appendages nearly as long as his fingers \u2014 and they smoked tobacco and opium in little brass pipes, and gambled through half of the night. They seemed intelligent, and were very dignified at table, partaking, of everything, and using their knife and fork, gracefully. By going ' forward ' we could see the ' deck ' passengers, a lower class, eating with chopsticks \u2014 little pieces of wood the size of lead pencils, and about eight inches in length, held between the thumb and forefinger, and supported by the second and third fingers \u2014 from numerous little bowls. Their food consisted o rice and little fishes, or bits of pork, or potted duck, and fruit, though shrimps, crabs, potatoes and squashes are also eaten by them ; very weak tea was drunk between meals, and at meals usually nothing, though sometimes I detected a bottle of so-called ' champagne.' ' John Chinaman ' lives temperately, though he has pretty exact ideas upon the subject of good living.

T. Bigandet, Bishop of Eangoon and Apostolic Vicar of Ava and Pegu. He is a talented and pleasant old gentleman, and was proceeding to Penang, for the purpose of ordaining a young priest there. The reverend father has lived twelve years in Penang and about the same time in Burma, and has travelled over nearly all the country between Calcutta and Singapore. He speaks eight languages, including the difficult Burmese, Malay, and Hindustani. He has written a very learned work on the ethnology of the Burmese, another on the life of Gaudama, the ways to Neibban, and the phongyees or monks, and is altogether the best informed gen tleman concerning those strange countries and their stranger peoples that we had the pleasure of meeting. At daylight on the morning of the 10th of May we were awakened by the steward, who whispered through the keyhole of the door of our cabin, ' Penang is in sight, gentlemen.' We dressed quickly, and going on deck, there we beheld the beautiful little island, scarcely two miles distant. A sudden rain squall came on, hiding everything from view, but we were soon anchored off Fort Cornwallis, and a notice was posted on the main-deck that the ' Mahratta '"], [127, "FROM MAULMAIN AND PENANG 91 would remain thirty hours, thus giving ample time for ' through ' passengers to land. An English war vessel, a small Siamese steamer, and a half-dozen ships of various nationalities lay at anchor near by, while farther to the southward were about a hundred Chinese junks. The strait in which we were anchored was about two miles wide, and Palo Penang, covered with cocoa and areca palms, (its name is derived from the latter, Penang being the Malay word for the betel-nut palm, and Palo meaning island ; it is also sometimes called Prince of Wales' Island), nutmeg and clove trees, dorians, and all the Malayan fruits, lay before us. It is fifteen miles in length and eight in width. The eastern part consists of a large plain, two or three miles in depth, and on the western side of the island there is a range of granite hills which rise in one place to a height of 2,500 feet, where there is a signal station, and some European bungalows, or country houses. Penang was purchased in 1785 by the East India Company from the Eajah of Queda, a neighbouring Malay prince, for 2,000 Spanish dollars. At that time the island was without a single inhabitant ; now it has a population of 60,000 Malays, Chinese, natives of India, other Asiatics, and Europeans, about 200 of the latter.

At one time black pepper was largely grown by the Chinese in Penang, but now Sumatra and some other East Indian islands have taken the lead in this valuable commodity. Penang forms, together with Province Wellesley, Malacca, and Singapore, what is called the Straits Settlements, the government being under the direction of the Lieutenant-Governor of ' Singapore, who formerly was subject to the Viceroy of India, but latterly, I believe, now reports directly to the (English) Home Government. The town \u2014 once called George Town \u2014 lies upon the north-eastern corner of the island. We are rowed ashore in a sampan \u2014 a small passenger row-boat \u2014 by a smiling Chinaman, who wears an immense hat, shaped like a sugar-bowl cover, made of palm leaf, and a coat or short cape made of rope, waterproof, and which strikingly resembles a western door-mat. Landing at the stone jetty, we enter a gharry, the regulation cab of the east, and are driven through some of the princi pal streets. Chinese sampans, as well as junks, all have huge eyes painted upon their prows, for, says"], [129, "93 FROM MAULMAIN AND PENANG ' John,' ' Spose no hab got eyes, how can see ? ' which terse explanation should certainly satisfy the most in quisitive. Biding along a broad and clean street, we noticed a few fine squares, though there were no public edifices of any particular beauty ; the private dwellings of the Europeans were pleasantly situated in the midst of fine gardens. Very many of the streets were occu pied by Chinese shops ; among them we noticed those in which the liquors shamshu and bhang (strong spirits made from rice and hemp) were dispensed ; there were also many joss or idol houses to be seen. A regiment of sepoys is stationed here ; the small fort commands the town and harbour, and just courts and an excellent police organisation combine to preserve order even with such a mixed population. The great fertility of Penang is owing to the high temperature of its climate, together with the moisture produced by so great an extent of surrounding water ; and it is perhaps a more healthy residence for Europeans than any lowland station in India. When one is worn with sickness or the cares of business, it is only necessary to go from the plains to the hills, eight miles distant, to find a perfect sanitarium, with a temperature which ranges from 70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 Fahrenheit throughout the year. We had fortunately abundant"], [130, "94 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT time to visit ' Penang Mountain.' In our gharry we rode four miles to the foot of the hills, and ordered two grooms with ponies to follow us for the steeper half \u2014 the remaining four miles of the journey. The road is very good, and runs past the foreign residences ; then ensue immense plantations of cocoa and areca palms, with little Malay huts embedded in them ; groves of bread-fruit trees, nutmegs, cloves, bananas, bamboos, and the pepper-plant follow ; then again we pass cocoa palms \u2014 millions of them ; and finally the gharry halts alike at the terminus of the road and the foot of the hills, and from here it is but a half-mile to a wonder ful waterfall. In the midst of dense woods a mountain torrent, about twenty feet in width, dashes down a precipice of jagged stone, at least a hundred and fifty feet in height, and falls, with a noise of thunder, into a small, deep pool, whence it flows on down the hill in a channel deeply cut through the solid rock. The fall is a grand sight now at the end of the dry season, but must be much grander after the annual rains, when the water is said to fall in a nearly solid sheet. On one side of this fall, at the bottom, there is a small Hindoo temple \u2014 a singular example of the reverence which even pagans have for the sublime in nature. From this mountain torrent large iron pipes convey"], [131, "FROM MAULMAIN AND PENANG 95 cool water to Penang, far away off on the heated plain. Our ponies had how arrived, and, mounted on their backs, we commenced the ascent of the hills by an ex cellent bridle-path. After a ride of about two miles, winding backwards and forwards over the hills and through the valleys, but continually rising higher, we reached a region of beautiful ferns, interlaced vines, and huge trees, having trunks over a hundred feet in height, straight ' as an arrow,' and with but few branches, and these near their tops, and so thickly set with their foliage that the brightest noonday sun could scarcely penetrate them. Occasionally we ob tained glimpses of the plains and sea below, but not until we had reached the signal station did the mag nitude and magnificence of the view burst upon us. The flag-staff is about 2,500 feet above the sea-level, and scattered around on convenient heights near at hand are some dozen bungalows, including a large and comfortable one belonging to the Governor. The view from the observatory was simply superb. Away to the north was the ocean, dotted by little green islands, and the peninsula of Malacca, with its level plains close to it, and ranges of mountains \u2014 some peaks over a mile in height \u2014 afar off; to the east lay the town of"], [132, "96 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT Penang, the houses with red tiled roofs, and white and yellow walls, the bright emerald groves of tropical trees, and the well-made roads, and the sea with hun dreds of vessels at anchor ; then beyond, on the main land, were perfect forests of cocoa palms, and a small river, shining like molten silver, wending away to the mountains, whose dim outlines could just be discerned in the distance ; to the south were some islands covered with the rankest of vegetation, and the eye also looked over the beautiful hills and valleys of Penang island itself; while to the westward lay the azure-hued ocean stretching away, in calm majesty, to the horizon. The air was so pure and exhilarating that we walked the greater part of the distance to the foot of the hills without fatigue, and then, re-entering our gharry, returned to the steamer, first purchasing, however, some dorians and mangosteens, the former fruit being largely grown in Penang. The mangosteen is about the size of a Sicily orange, and grows upon a small tree which much resembles the orange tree. The skin is a reddish brown, hke that of the egg-plant ; the rind is red, bitter, and about a third of an inch thick, and within it is a white pulp, divided into six or eight parts, each with a large seed. The flavour is very much like that of wild grapes, vinous and refreshing. On"], [133, "97 FROM MAULMAIN AND PENANG eating it the rind is broken with the fingers, and then the white pulp is removed with a fork or spoon. The mangosteen is justly esteemed the most delicious of the East Indian fruits. We had often heard of the exqui site flavour though disagreeable smell of the dorian, so we resolved to taste one of them and judge for ourselves. This fruit is much the shape of, though the size is larger than a pineapple ; it is green and covered with short thorns ; the husk is yellow, and about a third of an inch in thickness ; within the pulp is divided into four quarters, each with a central rib or partition, and six large seeds the size and shape of hen's eggs, which are covered with the thin. juicy, edible matter. The smell of the dorian when first opened is like stale Jish, and when eaten the flavour is like raw onions, leaving a nauseating garlic taste in the mouth. However, notwithstanding its rank odour, many Europeans resident in the east pro fess to like the dorian, but we thought its beginning, intervening, and final taste most unsavoury, nay, even extremely disgusting. On leaving Penang we had fairly entered the Straits of Malacca \u2014 a channel 500 miles in length, which connects the China Sea with the Indian Ocean, flowing between the Malay peninsula and the island H"], [134, "98 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT of Sumatra, with a width of from 25 to 200 miles, and steamed along in sight of land, on one hand or on the other, the greater part of the time.

We passed several large ships and two or three ' canalers,' steamers bound for different European ports, vid the Suez Canal. On the morning of the loth we sighted the old town of Malacca, and were soon after at anchor about three miles from the shore."], [135, "TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE 99 CHAPTEE X. TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE The town of Malacca, founded in the year 1252, was taken by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, by the Dutch in 1641, and by the English in 1695 ; again held by the Dutch from 1818 to 1825, when, with an adjacent territory extending for forty miles along the coast and thirty miles inland, it was ceded to Britain in exchange for Bencoolen, in Sumatra. Of late years Malacca has much declined ; whereas formerly it contained 20,000 inhabitants, there are now but 13,000 \u2014 two-thirds of which number are Malays. The trade is mostly in the hands of the Chinese ; there are not many Europeans, and none engaged in trade ; a few only are in the Government service. From our anchor age the little native town looks very pretty, and the European residences upon a small hill and an old church nearly covered with trees can just be discerned. To the right of the town, though thirty miles inland, lies Nit.

About the same distance to the left are some excellent tin mines. In the middle of the day, going on shore with the captain, the first objects which attracted our attention were the ruined churches, and the original fortifications built by Albuquerque, immediately behind the town upon a hill about a hundred feet in height. The ruins are those ofthe Portuguese monasteries of St. Paul and of the Ilermanos de leche with the church of Madre de Dios, in which once reposed the ashes of the celebrated apostle of the Indies, St. Francis Xavier, which were afterwards transferred to Goa. We saw a tomb slab within the crumbling walls, carved with an hour-glass and wings, death's head and cross bones, and bearing the date 1568, all in good preservation. One part of this church is now used as a signal station, and another as a powder magazine. We afterwards noticed in the town several tall, many-storied dwellings of the archi tecture of the 16th century. Entering a gharry, we were driven to the old cemetery, where sleep many thousand Chinese far from their ' flowery kingdom.' The grounds embrace a hill about a mile in circum ference, and upon its sloping sides all the graves have been dug ; there are no divisions between the stones,"], [137, "TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE 101 which are low, carved with Chinese characters, and sometimes gilded or coloured red or green. Chinese graves have no footstones, and the head stone is always placed towards the bottom of the hill, and around the remainder of the grave there runs a low horseshoe shaped wall, built even with the turf on its outer side. The vegetation of Malacca is, like that of Penang, very luxuriant. The streets of the town are clean, though not broad or straight. The Chinese houses are well made, two storeys in height, and as we rode along we generaUy saw, through the open doors, that they con tained mineral paintings of some one of their numerous gods. We took ' tiffin' (lunch) with an old Portuguese resident, born in Malacca, and the agent of the steam ship company to which the ' Mahratta ' belongs. In conversation afterwards the old gentleman told me that he acted the part of ' the good Samaritan ' to the des titute captain and officers of one of the American ships which the piratical Captain Semmes plundered and burned almost within sight of Singapore, and then brought into Malacca.

Like Malacca, very little of the town or city of Singapore appears from the sea, though a hill, with a signal-staff and the Governor's house, and a long row of well-built godowns (stores or warehouses), stand rather promi ently forth. We steam past two or three war vessels, two telegraph steamers (which are only awaiting orders from London to commence laying a wire from here to Hong Kong), and by some thirty or forty merchant ships of all nations to our anchorage in the crescent shaped roadstead about a mile from the town. We engage a Malay prow to take us ashore, and are landed near the Hotel d' Europe, to which our good captain has recommended us. This hotel we find to be very large and comfortable, situated in the midst of beautiful gardens, facing ' the green,' and commanding a fine view of the straits, the large island of Bintang in the distance, and the Chinese junks and foreign shipping in the harbour. Attached to the establishment, which is kept by a German, is that ' peculiar institution' an American bar-room, where California mixed drinks are served, and there is besides a ' regular down east B oston Arctic soda-water fountain ; ' a billiard-room ;"], [139, "103 TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE and a reading-room, where one will find papers and journals, in four or five languages, from New York, London, Bombay, Calcutta, Batavia, Hong Kong, Shanghae, Yokohama, and San Francisco. The island of Singapore, situated but eighty miles north of the equator, and separated from the mainland by a strait less than a mile in width, is itself about twenty-seven miles in length by fifteen in breadth, and no part of its surface rises more than 500 feet above the sea-level. Gutta-percha, the prepared juice of a tree, was originally discovered in this island ; the principal products are now spices, sugar-cane, and fruits ; the only important manufacture is that of sago, which, however, comes from the eastern parts of the Malay Archipelago. Singapore, taken by the British in 1818, was, six years subsequently, confirmed in their possession by treaty with the native Malay prince \u2014 the Sultan of Johore\u2014 to whom it had belonged. The town of Singapore is situated on the south-east corner of the island. The term Singapore or Singapura, is derived from the Sanscrit, singa, a lion, and pura, a town, Lion-town, or ' town of lions,' though why so fancifully named is not known ; there are no lions in the island, the nearest approach to the ' king of beasts ' being his royal cousin the Bengal tiger. Formerly these"], [140, "104 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT latter animals made sad havoc among the natives ; a man a day, on an average, was killed for many years after the founding of the settlement. The wily beasts were said to swim across the channel from the adjacent continent, where they were quite plentiful, and on this account it was thought impossible to rid the island of their presence ; but by cutting down and burning the jungle and building towns the annual death-rate has decreased to about a dozen a year, and these are usually coolies, who are employed in the spice and other plantations in the interior, far away from any dwellings. The present population of the island is nearly 100,000, of which number 60,000 are Chinese and about 6,000 Europeans. Singapore is said, for its size, to have the most conglomerate population of any city in the world. It is a free port, and conse quently has a large trade. It owes its present pro sperity, and even existence, to the fact of its being situated upon the great thoroughfare of eastern com merce ; ships can be found at this great entrepot of spices, pepper, sago, rattan, coirrope, oil, etc., loading for all parts of the world ; it is a coaling station for the men-of-war of all nations, and the IndiaTand China lines of steamers make it a port ; it is a great com mercial emporium in which are warehoused for future"], [141, "105 TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE distribution the staple products of America, Europe, and Asia. Fifty years ago even, Crawford \u2014 at one time Governor of the settlement \u2014 said that Singapore had become the great entrepot of south Asia and the Malay Archipelago, to which the inhabitants of all parts of the Indian Ocean resorted with the produce of their farming and manufacturing industry, and in which they found a ready market abundantly stocked with every variety of European goods. During our stay at Singapore we received every kindness and attention from the American Consul, Dr. Jewell, of Washington, D.C., who lived with his wife in the same hotel. Dr. J. and his family are Mississippians by birth, education, and residence, but they remained faithfully loyal to the National Govern ment during our late terrible civil war. The Doctor has been -seventeen years in Washington, connected, in various capacities, with both the Treasury and Post- Master General's Departments. He had lived a little more than two years in Singapore, and was both able and willing to give us much valuable information. One day we visited Fort Canning to obtain a general view of Singapore. This fort, built upon a small pyramid-shaped hill, about 200 feet in height, and just back of the town, mounts, among numerous guns of"], [142, "106 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPILANT smaller calibre, some few 68-pounders, and is. garri soned by 300 British and 700 Sepoy troops. Singapore is divided into a Malay, Chinese, and European ' town,' or quarter ; it is too irregular to present a handsome appearance, but the view of the shipping in the harbour and the distant islands is rather impressive. The town is divided by a small river, in which are thousands of native craft of every description, many of them being employed as lighters in the harbour. On the extreme western side lies the Chinese quarter ; nearer is the European business town, the centre of which is laid out iu a small garden or park, around which is a narrow street faced by two strong brick stores, and called ' Commercial Square.' To the east of the river are the public buildings, the esplanade, chief hotels, European residences, and the greater part of the Kling community. In this quarter of the town is a hand some building styled the ' Singapore Institution,' fur nished with a library, museum, branch schools, &c, for the cultivation of the Chinese and Malay languages and literatures ; it was established by Sir Stamford Eaffles, the founder of the settlement of Singapore, in 1823. The Governor's house is a large brick and stucco building on the summit of a little knoll, perhaps half a mile inland from Fort Canning. Were it not"], [143, "107 TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE for its immense cupola it would be mistaken for a Government department or office of some kind, and, as it is, the second storey, composed entirely of arches and Venetian blinds, and the upper storey formed of pillars and Venetians, present a very ugly appearance. There are few trees about the house, so that it receives the entire force of both sun and rain, and, excepting only when a strong breeze is blowing, it must be a very uncomfortable residence. The large Chinese temple of Singapore is worthy of a visit. It is situated in one of the principal streets, and consists of a plain stone house with most fantastic and curious adornments, having a court-yard in front and around open sheds. Before the entrance there two large stone tigers, in whose mouths held by the teeth, may be seen and felt, perfectly round, loose stones, so cut out by an ingenious Chinaman. Then there are bas-reliefs, and inscriptions, and figures carved upon the front of the building, while its pillars are encircled by enormous dragons. But it is in the supporting of the roof that the most lavish ornamen tation is to be seen \u2014 the wood carving of gods, and animals, and flowers, and arabesques, all painted and gilded, being something wonderful. In the interior of the large building are three niches, and in these sit"], [144, "108 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT three gods, each about a foot in height, carved in wood and richly gilded ; and before them are altars upon which burn a peculiar kind of punk, or slow- match, and candles, and there are besides fruits and rice, placed as votive offerings. On these altars there were also ivishing-blocks \u2014 pieces of wood five inches by three, shaped like kidney-beans, and finely carved. In ' wishing ' they are held by one extremity, side by side in the hands, and then thrown in the air, the manner of their falling indicating good or evil fortune ; but I have heard somewhere that the ingenious people have a knack of throwing them until they fall in the desired way. Near the wishing-blocks upon the altar were huge metallic cups, containing each about fifty little thin sticks of bamboo. Each of these sticks has a number upon it, which indicates a passage in their ' Book of Moral Sentences,' and the Chinamen shake the cups round until one of these little sticks falls outy and if the reference to this should not prove satis factory, why, they simply shake again, and so on. Some of the idols resembled jolly old mandarins, but most had a very disagreeable look, with their narrow, almond-shaped eyes, broad, sensual faces, and thick, flabby lips. The interior of this temple was covered with the most flaring red and black Chinese texts, and"], [145, ""], [146, "THE FAN PALM\u2014' THE TRAVELLER'S FOUNTAIN"], [147, "109 TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE the roofs were ornamented with little dragons, made of encaustic tiles and glass. O We next visited the market, which contained a great variety of vegetables and fruits, but few meats, the Chinese diet consisting principally of fish and pork. We drove several times, while in Singapore, into the interior of the island, vid Orchard Eoad and Eiver Valley Eoad, on which are situated the European bun galows, or country houses, from two to four miles from town. Orchard Eoad seems to be the most popular as a residence. After leaving town it passes through a narrow valley, with a series of little hillocks on either hand, and upon which many houses have been built. The road is very pretty, being lined by tall bamboo hedges and trees which, uniting above, form a com plete shade ; the beautiful fan-palm \u2014 or ' traveller's fountain,' as it is sometimes called \u2014 will deserve especial notice, with its immense spread of feathery leaves, constituting an exact semicircle. The bun galows are generally built of brick and stucco, like those of India, and are surrounded by large compounds, or gardens. The vegetation is always in the full bloom of summer in Singapore, owing to its proximity to the equator and the almost daily showers of rain. Beyond the residences are the remains of many nutmeg planta-"], [148, "110 THE LAND OF THE WIHTE ELEPHANT tions (the nutmeg for some reason or other will not flourish in Singapore), then succeeds a strip of thin jungle, then the Chinese pepper and gambier planta tions, and then comes the jungle in earnest, with its gigantic trees, creepers, orchids, parasites, and fallen or decayed trees, plants, and vegetables. A very beautiful spot near Singapore is called New Harbour. The harbour consists of a long row of wharves, about three miles from town, where the Peninsular and Oriental and the Messageries Maritimes steamers he, and where there are coal sheds, and docks built for their repair. New Harbour is nearly land-locked by many beautiful little green islands, and the clear blue water and the graceful hills of Singapore add to the charm of the scene. Cocoa-nut oil is a large item of export from Singapore. Dr. Little, an English gentleman and an old resident, to whom I was so fortunate as to bring letters of intro duction, called one morning at the hotel to take me in his buggy to a large cocoa-nut plantation, owned partly by himself and five miles distant from the town. The estate is nearly a mile square, embracing about six hundred acres, situated near the sea shore, and the soil, at least as far as the roots penetrate, is entirely com posed of sand. The trees are planted in rows each"], [149, "111 TO MALACCA AND SINGAPORE way about twenty feet apart, and are of all ages and sizes. Cocoa-nuts are raised principally for their oil, though rope is made from their husks, and some quan tity of them is exported for food. We walked for some time beneath the trees, and then, re-entering the buggy, drove to a distant part of the plantation where there was a coir-rope manufactory. The European manager was kind enough to explain the different pro cesses of manufacture, which are extremely simple. First the cocoa-nuts are broken in halves, and the meat is grated off the shells and boiled down to make oil, while the husks are soaked for a clay or two in a large tank of water. When taken from the tank they are quite soft, and their coats are then removed by simply forcing them between and through two rough rollers (revolving by steam) ; this process leaves the long straight fibres, which are something like those of a broom, and next they are cleaned by being placed in a large fan-mill. The fibres are then taken to another house, where they are again cleaned by shaking them in the air with two sticks, and then they are ready to be spun into ropes of various sizes. There are several ingenious as well as simple contrivances for the twisting of the strands, though the greater part of the rope is made by hand. Nearly 200 Malays and Chinese"], [150, "112 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT were employed in this establishment, which ' turns out ' about 25,000 pounds of rope per annum. This kind of rope, though extensively used by vessels, is not so strong as that made from hemp. We took a chota hagree, a little breakfast, with the obliging superintendent, and arrived in town again about nine o'clock, at the regular breakfast hour. In the afternoon we rode to the house and gardens ofthe Hon. Mr. Whampoa, a Chinese merchant who, unlike the majority of his countrymen, has settled for hfe at Singapore, where he has been for a long time in business, and is reported to have made a fortune of #2,000,000.

His house, three miles from the town, is a complete museum, filled with the most expensive and beautiful curios from all countries, while his gardens \u2014 he is a great lover of flowers \u2014 are one of the ' lions ' of the place, and one of the first questions asked a stranger by the European residents of Singapore is, 'Have you seen the Chinaman's gardens? if not, be sure and do so before leaving.'

Walking along, we saw fish-ponds, summer-houses, canals, hedges, a very network of paths, neatly gravelled, and then we came to the \u2014 pig-sty, a long shed filled with separate pans, or boxes, in which immense pigs, of different breeds, were wallowing, one hog \u2014 nearly the size of a cow \u2014 being too fat to stand upon its feet. We also had an opportunity to see a sago manu factory through the kindness of Dr. Little, who sent his Chinese servant, who spoke English, with us as cicerone.

The sago palm bears but once \u2014 in its fifteenth year \u2014 it is then cut down, the pith is removed, cleared of its fibres, pressed into small masses, and, being bound with leaves, is shipped to the factory.

The factory consisted of a series of large open sheds, aud the workmen were all Chinese. Chinamen are the in dustrious, hard-working class of the native population of Singapore; the Malays and Klings (from the Coromandel coast of India) are boatmen, gharry wallahs (cab drivers), sailors, dhobees (washermen), fishermen, &c. It may give some idea of the remarkable produce of the sago palm when it is known that three trees will yield more nutritive matter than an acre of wheat, and six trees more than an acre of potatoes.

His Majesty was at the time absent from the kingdom on a pleasure excursion to Calcutta and India. Proceeding up the river, just above Pakuam we noticed another small fort having a few guns, but no guard or other evidence of occupation. Opposite this fort on an island is a plain white pagoda and some small temples ; these are used only on particular festival days. The river banks are very beautiful, being thickly covered with the vegetation peculiar to the tropics \u2014 bamboos, bananas, cocoa palms, mangroves, and hun dreds of plants of familiar form but unknown name. We next passed some immense sugar-cane plantations,"], [159, "HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF SIAM"], [160, ""], [161, "119 BANGKOK then some paddy fields and a Burmese village on the right, and orange gardens and a small town on the left bank. The river here doubles upon itself, so to speak, thus increasing the distance to Bangkok by fifteen miles. We afterwards passed large plains of betel-nut and cocoa-nut palms on the one side, and dock and ship building yards upon the other. Owing to a low tide we anchor here, though the city proper is nearly two miles distant, and nothing can be seen of it, the ground being too level and the vegetation too dense. The captain takes me ashore in his gig. We pass on the right a Freuch Eoman Catholic church, another custom-house, and the Consulates of America, Ger many, England, France, and Portugal. These consular buildings are plainly built of brick and stucco, situated in large compounds of plants and flowers near the river. In this section of the Menam are anchored many small barks, most of them flying the national standard of a white elephant on a crimson ground ; no large vessels and no steamers are to be seen, though in commerce Bangkok once ranked second only to Cal cutta and Canton. We land at Falcks' ' Bowling Alley and Billiard HaU,' and enquire for rooms in the boarding and lodging department, which we And situated a short"], [162, "120 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT distance back from the river. ' Falcks' Hotel ' consists of a long, low, one-storey building, raised upon piles about four feet from the ground, and I am shown by the polite proprietor into a room less than ten feet square, it being ' the best the house affords ; ' the sides of this room extend only to the eaves of the roof, the entire building being open above them to the ridge pole. The people assembled at dinner were all Germans, and apparently all skippers \u2014 masters of the merchant vessels in port. The table was graced by the presence of but one lady, a captain's wife. On the following day, being the bearer of a letter of introduction to the Private Secretary of the Supreme King \u2014 Nai phon Eaya nat tianahar \u2014 I called upon the American Consul \u2014 General F. W. Partridge, of Illinois \u2014 to ask his advice concerning its disposal. Sending in my card, a tall and slender gentleman about sixty years of age, dressed in a white duck suit with gilt army buttons, soon presented himself, and gave me a most cordial greeting. Upon stating that, having no acquaintance there, I had taken the liberty to call and ask his advice concerning the things best worth seeing in Bangkok and the surrounding country, the General very kindly offered me any assistance in his power. The Private Secretary, to whom my letter was addressed, had gone"], [163, "121 BANGKOK with the King to Calcutta. The Consul \u2014 a truly representative American \u2014 graduated in the University of Vermont ; was president for some time of a college in Pennsylvania ; served in the Mexican war and through the greater part of the late civil war, and bears upon his body many scars \u2014 honourable proofs of fidelity and zeal in his country's cause. He has resided in Bangkok a little more than two years, and proposes remaining two more. In the afternoon the Consul's son, who acted as U.S. Marshal, kindly took me to see something of the city. We went in the Consulate barge, which is simply a large row-boat of the gondola pattern, with a small pavilion in its centre fitted with blinds and shelves and seats and cushions ; and the boatmen in livery, two behind and two before, row standing and facing the bow, look ing forwards. Bangkok has been aptly styled the ' Venice of the East,' for its thoroughfares and high ways of traffic are simply intersecting canals and branches. of the river ; and the majority of the houses are either floating, built upon rafts, or upon piles on the sides of these waterways. There are some narrow paths on terra fir ma, however, and the King has recently built a long stretch of road as a drive ; it is reported that he also promises to build highways alongside of the"], [164, "122 THE LAND OF THE WIHTE ELEPHANT principal canals. The situation of Bangkok is unique. The river Menam flows through its western quarter, and upon the eastern there is a wall fifteen feet in height aud about twelve in breadth. When the capital was moved here from Ayuthia, in 1769, the houses were built upon the banks of the river, but the cholera became so frequent that one of their kings ordered the people to build upon the river itself, which, ' owing to greater cleanliness and better ventilation,' proved to be much more healthful. The houses are built upon bamboo rafts, which extend for several miles along the river, four or six deep, chained together and to the shore ; and each raft is secured to a pole driven into the muddy bottom by rattan ropes, in such a manner as to allow of its rising and falling with the tide. It is said there are as many as twelve thousand of these floating dwellings and shops. Siamese houses are generally built of bamboo, covered in roofs and sides with atap pahn leaves, and are one storey in height. Those on the river front are mostly shops owned by Chinamen ; they have two little peaked roofs and a small verandah, and one side is left open to display goods to those passing on the river. When a family dwelling in a floating house wish to move, they simply cast off the moorings and float with the tide up or down the river, as the"], [165, "123 BANGKOK case may be. There are said to be only two divisions in a Siamese house ; of these one is occupied by males and the other by females. The floors of the houses which are built (raised upon piles) on the banks of the canals are reached by ladders, those on the river have small landing-places and steps on their rafts. The existence of the Siamese, like that of the Burmese, may almost be said to be amphibious ; they seem to pass more than half their lives in or on the water, and their chief food is the supply they get from it, fish. Everywhere we see canoes and boats, many of them propelled by women and little boys. ' Boats are the universal means of conveyance and communication. Except about the palaces of the kings, horses or carriages are never seen [1858], and the sedan of the Chinese appears unknown in Siam ; but a boat is a necessary part of every person's household ; to its dexterous management every child is trained ; women and men are equally accustomed to the use of the oar, the paddle, and the rudder. From the most miserable skiff which seems scarcely large enough to hold a dog, to the magnificently adorned barge which is honoured with the presence of royalty, from the shab biest canoe hewn out of the small trunk of a tree from the jungle up to the roofed and curtained, the carved"], [166, "124 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT and gilded bark of the nobles \u2014 every rank and con dition has its boats plying in endless activity, night and day, on the surface of the Menam waters.' For nearly half a mile both banks of the canal were lined with rice factories, owned, almost without an exception, by the Chinese ; their business is to separate the rice kernel from its paddy husk and pack it for shipment. Then we came to the Wat Sah Kate pagoda, situated in a vast enclosure, containing besides, after the usual arrangement, two or three temples, with huge gilt images of Budha within them, a large building for preaching, the dwellings of the priests, and many pavilions for the use of worshippers ; but the grounds were in a very dilapidated condition. The King had recently turned ' adrift ' all the priests, several hundreds of them, to earn an honest living by hard work instead of begging, and so the ivat, or temple, was closed to the public. The pagoda is not completed, but still sufficient has been built to convey an idea of the original design. It was erected by a prince about fifty years ago, and is the largest edifice of the kind in the city. Built of brick, the form is that of a bell, with a circumference of about a thousand feet, and an altitude of about two hundred and fifty feet. The sides are covered with small niches (probably intended as the"], [167, ""], [168, "TEMPLES AND PAGODAS AT BAXKOJ"], [169, "125 BANGKOK receptacle of idols), and many narrow, sunken stair cases lead to the summit; a large one on the outside winds around it to the top, which is a level place about fifty feet square, and upon which rests another pagoda, perhaps seventy-five feet in height. This one has pas sages through it, and in the centre there is a small brass image of Budha. From the summit of this huge pile of brick may be obtained a very fine view of the city of Bangkok and its surroundings ; though this is hardly a correct statement, for you see very few of the dwelling-houses of the city ; here and there a wat, or pagoda, the river with its shipping, the palace of the King, and a waving sea of cocoa-nut and betel-nut palms, is about all that distinctly appears. The general appearance of Bangkok is that of a large, primitive village, situated in and mostly concealed by a virgin forest of almost impenetrable density. On one side beyond the city limits were paddy fields, and on the other to the very horizon stretched the exuberant jungle. On the bank of the river opposite the palace stands the most remarkable pagoda in Bangkok, called Wat Cheng. While being rowed thither I was much struck with the resemblance of the Siamese women to the men, their features being very similar, being"], [170, "126 THE LAND OF THE WinTE ELEPHANT dressed nearly alike, and both having the head shaved in the same manner ; but upon close inspection it was usually seen that there were some distinguishing marks \u2014 that the women wore a narrow scarf around the shoulders, and allowed a lock of hair, some three inches in length, to hang down before the ear. Seen from the river, the floating houses, swiftly-passing boats, wats and pagodas, and palaces together form a scene partaking more perhaps of the quaint and odd than of either the beautiful or grand. The Wat Cheng pagoda is bell-shaped, with a lofty, tapering steeple \u2014 &prachadi, sacred spire ; the whole probably two hundred and fifty feet in height. It is built of brick and plastered on the outside, which is wrought into a grotesque and fantastic mosaic with Chinese cups, plates, and dishes of all sizes and colours, broken and whole, so set in the plaster as to form figures of elephants, monkeys, demons and griffins, flowers, fruits, vines and arabesques. In large niches upon the sides, at nearly half the distance to its top, are images of Budha riding on three elephants. The grounds of Wat Cheng, some twenty acres in extent, embrace \u2014 besides the priests' dwellings, temples, preaching-room, library, and halls\u2014beautiful flower and fruit gardens, ponds, grottoes, belvederes, and stone statues .(brought"], [171, "WAT CHENG PAGODA, BANGKOK"], [172, ""], [173, "127 BANGKOK from China) of sages, giants, warriors, griffins, nondescripts, &c. In returning to the hotel we stopped at a floating booth where a theatrical entertainment was in progress. The dresses of the performers were rich, and the acting was much in the Chinese style, though there was perhaps not so much wanting, the voices being pitched to a more natural key. A great part of the dialogue was in verse ; and the accompanying music was most primitive and droll, consisting simply of beating two bamboo sticks together. A band of three ' pieces ' was also in attendance, and the music discoursed was of a lively character, and very much resembled some of the Scotch and Irish airs. The play was gross and obscene throughout, as is usually the case among eastern nations. The Siamese are alike fond of their national music and drama. In company with the Consulate interpreter, ' Henry \" \u2014a good-natured, intelligent Siamese, who spoke Eno-lish quite well \u2014 I visited other of the temples and pagodas of Bangkok. To the Wat Sah Prah Tarn, situated without the city walls, we were admitted by the porter in charge, after paying a silver tical (about 60 cts.) At one extremity of this temple was a large gilded image of Budha, with a smaller one just in"], [174, "128 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT front, both sitting cross-legged, and being surrounded by many costly garments. The walls were painted in gaudy colours, with pictures of the annual or semi annual religious visit of the King and Court to this wat. In these paintings the landscapes were fairly executed, TEMPLE OF THE SLEEPING IDOL, BANGKOK though the colours were too deep and decided, the contrasts too great, the perspective often at fault ; and the figures were stiff, and faces smiling, but devoid of any distinguishing character. This wat and all Siamese wats are lofty buildings of brick, with roofs rising in"], [175, "129 BANGKOK connected but decreasing tiers, and projecting over deep verandahs, which are supported by rows of massive square pillars, some of them sixty feet in height, and the whole is covered with white cement. The roofs are usually made of varicoloured tiles, and at the ridge-pole extremities are wooden ornaments very much the shape and size of a bullock's horn, which give an odd and fanciful but rather graceful finish to the buildings. The doors are large and covered with fine carving, gilt and black ; the windows (or rather window shutters, for there is no glass), which are numerous, are also carved and sometimes ornamented with small pieces of coloured glass. There are many temples belonging to the Chinese, which race is so largely represented in the population of Bangkok. The largest of these, called Wat Con layer Nemit, contains a brass, cross-legged (sitting) Budha, about fifty feet in height and forty in width at the bent knees. The immense roof of this temple is as much as one hundred feet from the ground. A great heap of betel-nuts was stored in one, and two or three keepers or priests were hving in another corner of the sacred edifice. There were two smaller wats within the same enclosure ; the one contained a brass Budha sitting upon a rock, supported by a copper elephant on K"], [176, "130 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT one side and a leaden monkey looking up with rever ential eyes on the other. The other wat contained a large central image of Budha, and about a hundred smaller ones in different positions, before and around it ; some were made of lead, some of brass, some of mixed metal, some of wood, and ' Henry,' the inter preter, tells me there were some there also of gold and silver, presented by the princes and nobles, but the piiest in attendance could not be induced to point out their locality. The walls were covered with coloured illustrations of Siamese tradition, fable, and history. Having pretty extensively traversed the city by water, one day some friends proposed a horse-back ride to the palace walls and back. We rode over a good, macadamised road, built by the late Supreme King, to the main entrance of the palace, where we saw a battalion of native troops exercising. Halting for a few moments, we observed that their drill and evolu tions were performed with rapidity and exactness. Their uniform consisted of yellow coats and blue trousers, with white canvas caps (navy pattern) ; their feet were bare, and their weapons were muskets and swords of European design and manufacture. The palace walls, fifteen feet high by twelve in width, with a notched parapet, and the trees conceal most of the"], [177, "BRASS IDOL IK TEJirLE : BANGKOK"], [178, ""], [179, "131 BANGKOK buildings within, though we noticed some such lofty structures as a clock-tower, also some wats, pagodas, and ' sacred spires.' The native houses have been torn down and cleared away for some considerable dis tance around the walls, and it is intended that this space shall be neatly turfed or arranged in parks and flower gardens. At one corner of the palace enclosure we passed the royal (black) elephant stables \u2014 a dozen in number \u2014 the ' white ' elephant being housed within the walls. The gates of the palace are built of simple teak wood, embossed with huge nails, but they are neither strong nor handsome. Near this part of the city the late King has laid out several streets at right angles to each other, and built upon them compact blocks of two-storey brick houses, which are now rented by the Government (the King ?) to the people. The present King has followed the example of his royal father in these civic improvements. He has built a good road around the city just within the walls, and also several blocks of houses next ad joining those erected by the late King.

EXCURSION TO PECHABURI To the kindness of the American Consul I was indebted for an introduction to the Private Secretary of the Second King and Secretary of the Foreign Office \u2014 a Mr. Chandler, formerly of Connecticut. This gentleman told me he came out to Siam twenty eight years ago in the capacity of a missionary. He has lived here during the reign of three Siamese kings, and has witnessed the arrival and departure of several foreign missions, whose commercial leagues or treaties with Siam he has often been instrumental in furthering or negotiating. He has seen the country progress in legislation and commerce, until now nearly every western Power is represented by its consul resident at Bangkok, and Siam is fast becoming one of the most enlightened nations east of Calcutta. Several years ago Mr. C. gave up his missionary labours and entered the Government service, first as an interpreter, next as tutor to the King, and then as Secretary of the Foreign Office, which latter position he at present"], [184, "134 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT retains. Mr. Chandler's family consists only of a wife \u2014 \u25a0 a most worthy lady, who came from home with her husband to assist him in his religious labours, and who now employs her time in teaching about a dozen Siamese boys the English language and rudiments of education. From this excellent couple I received every hospitality, and now, from afar, desire to tender them my most heartfelt acknowledgments. One day when relating to Mr. Chandler what I had seen of interest in Bangkok, he said to me : ' Before leaving Siam you should visit a large town about 100 miles south-west of here, called Pechaburi. It is a sanitarium for both Europeans and natives, and the King has built himself a palace there, also some temples, some good roads and bridges. You go there,' continued my friend, ' in a large barge, called a \" house \" boat, rowed by six men, and in which you eat and sleep, carry your books and papers, and at your ease survey the country and people as you pass along.' ' It would be a pleasant and interesting ex cursion surely,' I replied, ' and, not being pressed for time, I will go. Perhaps the Consul's son would like to take a rest from his official duties and make the trip with me ; I will ask him.' Mr. Partridge, upon consultation, like the redoubt-"], [185, "135 EXCURSION TO PECHABURI able Barkis, ' was willin ;' and a large ' house ' boat with five rooms, a cook, and table-boy having been engaged, we slipped away from the Consulate, rowed up the beautifully-lighted Menam \u2014 the Mother of Waters \u2014 and turned into the canal leading westward from about the centre of the city on the evening of the 7th of January. Our beds, with the ubiquitous mosquito nettings above them, had been placed in the comfortable cabin, our clothes and provisions packed away underneath its floor, and the cooking utensils, ready for use, were arranged in the stern quarter, back of the cabin. About nine o'clock on the fol lowing morning we stopped for breakfast and to rest our crew, who had rowed hard most of the night ; and while we foreigners ate, the boatmen looked curiously on, and then in turn when they ate we gazed, no doubt, quite as curiously at them and their strange meal. Siamese food, at least that of the lower classes, consists principally of dried (often putrid) fish and rice, which are eaten in the form of curries, highly seasoned with pepper and spices. All classes in Siam use a sauce called namphrik, which differs from the Burmese fish condiment ngapee, in that a greater variety of articles are employed in its composition ; it also mixes with rice like the Indian chutnee, though it"], [186, "136 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT approximates more in appearance and flavour to this paste than does the Burmese ngapee. The Siamese sauce is prepared, when all the desired ingredients are at hand, ' by bruising a quantity of red pepper in a mortar, to which are added kapi (paste of shrimps and prawns), black pepper, garlic, and onions. These being thoroughly mixed, a small quantity of brine and citron-juice is added. Ginger, tamarinds, and gourd seeds are also employed.' That the namphrik is ' one of the most appetite-exciting condiments ' I know my self by experience ; it is also, though very hot and ' high,' a savoury and toothsome addition to the ordinary curry of simple meat, rice, and gravy. People who are rich of course provide themselves with a variety of dainties. The Siamese eat from a common dish, with the fingers usually, though sometimes they use small spoons made of china or mother-of-pearl : water or tea is drunk with their meals, of which it is customary to have but two in the day \u2014 the breakfast at seven in the morning, and the dinner between the hours of five and six in the afternoon. Between meals, during the day, they chew the betel-nut, and smoke cigarettes made of native-grown tobacco, rolled in little slips of palm-leaf. The Siamese sometimes drink strong spirit in the form of arrack (made from boiled"], [187, "137 EXCURSION TO PECHABURI rice, molasses, and palm wine), though very rarely, and almost always secretly. During the morning we crossed the Mahachen river, its banks thickly clad with verdure, and a canal which was straight and about thirty miles in length. The countiy was level, and at first only covered with rank grass ; and we passed but few villages. But afterwards the banks of the canal were lined with bananas and atap palms, and beyond were market gardens and paddy fields. The capital is in great part supplied by the vegetables raised here ; and the renters of the land and the labourers are almost all Chinese. In the afternoon we crossed another river \u2014 the Haichin \u2014 and late in the evening entered and rowed for a considerable distance down the Meklong \u2014 a large and deep river\u2014 and passed into another canal and anchored for the night. The banks of the Meklong seemed to be thickly settled, and the country in the distance was undulating and even hilly. A town called Meklong, near the mouth of this river, was the birthplace of the famous Siamese Twins. The face of the country improved as regards trees and vegetation as we went on, until we entered the Pechaburi river, which we were in and out of half a dozen times, while cutting off long and sinuous reaches by short cross-canals."], [188, "138 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT At three o'clock we arrived at Pechaburi, and having anchored at the outskirt of the town, sent our letters from the Consul at Bangkok to the Governor, request ing the use of a house, horses, &c, during our stay. The reply of the Governor, coming at last, allotted us a small brick house, furnished (?) with some bamboo mats, a table, and two chairs, upon the banks of the river : the lower storey or portion of the building had been set apart for, and evidently been recently used by, some domestic animals, such as sheep and dogs, and perhaps horses. In the evening we took a long walk through the bazaars and market along a macadamised street lined by substantial two-storey brick houses. The variety and quality of the native food exposed for sale in the market quite astonished both of us. The town of Pechaburi, built on both banks, and twenty miles from the mouth of a river bearing the same name, contains about twenty thousand inhabitants ; it is about a hundred miles distant south west from Bangkok, and is situated near the range of hills which divides the kingdom of Siam from the Tenasserim Provinces. Pechaburi is chiefly noted as a royal sanitarium. At the back of the town, on the summit of a beautiful hill, stands a large palace, built by the late Supreme King. On an adjoining hill are some"], [189, "139 EXCURSION TO PECHABURI pagodas and temples, and at the foot of the hill are some Budhist monasteries, where native youth are gratuitously educated, and near these is a cave filled with idols. There are some fine roads in and about Pechaburi, which were also built by the late King. On our return to the boat we met the Governor riding in a buggy, but he stopped, and we had some conver sation with him through the interpreter. The Governor of Pechaburi was a young man, not intellectual or smart-looking ; he was dressed in a European shirt and sun-hat (topee), with the native panoung, or cloth, which is worn around the waist and passed between the legs, striped socks, and patent-leather slippers. His servants laid abjectly upon the ground, with their feet behind them (in Burmese fashion), whenever they addressed His Excellency. In the buggy there was a finely-wrought gold \u00e6roh, or betel-box \u2014 an article in almost constant requisition by every Siamese noble- man. Two missionaries of the American Presbyterian Board, with their famihes, hve here, and they are the only foreigners in the town. Later in the evening we called upon the Eev. Mr. MacFarland ; his confrere, who owns the adjoining house, was away on a leave of absence at the time. The reverend gentleman"], [190, "140 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT \u2014 from Pennsylvania, U.S. \u2014 has lived twelve years in Siam, and has enjoyed very good health, notwith standing the trying climate. He speaks the Siamese and Laos dialects perfectly, and thoroughly understands the people and their country after so long a residence. Mr. MacFarland told me he had made about twenty converts \u2014 that only one had relapsed into his old faith during his ministration. I remarked that I thought the Siamese seemed much more anxious to learn English than they were to acquire new religious tenets. He assented, but doubted the value of a general diffusion of the English language, notwithstanding there were no scientific, literary, or educational books as yet translated into the Siamese vernacular. He thought that the mission was too young to have expected greater successes \u2014 that the harvest truly was plenteous, but the labourers were few. Perhaps the most interesting buildings in Pechaburi are those constituting the King's palace, which is situated upon a low hill near the town. His Majesty and some members of the Court are accustomed to spend part of every summer there. Eiding across the plain to the foot of the hill, and there dismounting, we walk over a wide brick-paved path to the top, passing on the way many solas, or sheds open on the sides,"], [191, "141 EXCURSION TO PECHABURI and used for entertainments of various kinds, for quartering soldiers,. &c. One of these sheds contained four or five mounted twelve-pounder cannon. The grounds were in a wretched state, being overgrown with weeds, but upon the annual visits of the King everything is put in good order. The path soon led us up steep staircases, with massive stone balustrades, and by several plain two-storey brick buildings used by His Majesty's friends and officers. Next we ap proached the private apartments of the King, with their wide, paved terraces and surrounding barracks. On the very summit of the hill, which is quite sharp, are three buildings \u2014 the royal audience hall, a temple, and an observatory. The audience hall is almost entirely without ornament. It is a long, low room about seventy-five feet in length by forty in width and twelve in height. The exterior walls are decorated between the windows, with a poor representation, carved in wood, of the flags of all nations existing upon the globe \u2014 evidently a recent addition to the building. The interior walls and ceihngs are covered with a dingy-brown paper. At one end of the room is a semicircular throne, consisting of four stone steps, and painted upon the walls on either side are some excellent samples of Siamese art. The subjects are, of"], [192, "142 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT the one, the ' Eeception of the French Ambassadors at Court,' and of the other ' Bonzes worshipping Gaudama.' The observatory is a round brick tower about thirty feet in height. From its top the country, as far as we could see, was a vast plain of paddy, broken here and there on every side by small, thickly wooded hills \u2014 luxuriant islets in a waveless sea of verdure \u2014 away to the north and west were low ranges of dark-blue mountains, and upon the south shone brightly, in the rays of the rising sun, the tranquil Gulf of Siam. After a long ride we reached a large ivat, near which, in the side of one of the hills, is a subterranean cavern, styled the ' Cave of Idols,' consisting of several small chambers connected by narrow passages. Light is admitted through one or two openings in its ceiling, though the greater part requires to be illuminated by torches. Judging from its material and structure, we. thought the cave to be of volcanic origin. Its sides, within, are lined with rows of gilt Budhas, and at the end of one of the halls there is a huge reclining image of the same divinity. The trees about the mouth of the cave were filled with chattering and grinning monkeys. At sight of us they scampered from branch to branch and tree to tree, and then would sit still and"], [193, "143 EXCURSION TO PECHABURI steadily observe us in a most amusing manner for as much as an entire minute at a time. At the bottom of the hill we inspected a temple in which was an immense reclining Budha. This colossal image was built of brick and chunam (lime), and covered with thick gold-leaf; it was clothed with yellow (the priestly colour) garments, and lay in the ordinary state of repose, its head upon the right hand and resting on a gaily ornamented pillow. I paced the length of this idol, and made it to be 135 feet \u2014 its feet being seven feet in width, ears ten feet in length, and other members of hke enormous proportions. The object the priests have in view in building such monstrous statues of Budha is to impress and awe the (common) people, and, besides, the larger the idol the more merit there will accrue to its makers. A few miles from Pechaburi is a Laos village. It consists of only about twenty huts. These are built upon piles and made of bamboo, roofed with palm leaves. Under the floors are stables for the domestic animals and space for rubbish of all kinds. We en tered the house of the chief magistrate of the viUage \u2014 an old man, wearing nothing but a cotton panoung (waist cloth). He cheerfully showed us his house, which had but two rooms \u2014 a small one used as a"], [194, "144 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT general sitting-room, and a large one intended for both kitchen and bed-chamber \u2014 and which was the home of a large family, whose relationships embraced three generations.

In the rear of the hut, but attached to it, was a large bin, made of bamboo and plaster, in which was stored rice (their ' staff of life,' or bread). The chief city of the Laos people in Northern Siam is Xiengmai, with about fifty thousand inhabitants. The Laos tribes have been many times at war with Siam, and. have generally proved themselves to be no mean adversaries.

AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SIAM It had been my earnest desire to obtain an audience with the Supreme King of Siam, but, as His Majesty was in Calcutta at the time of my visit, of course the wish could not be gratified ; still, I could hardly esteem myself less fortunate in being granted, through the kind intervention of the American Consul, an audience with the Second King, H.M. Krom Prah Eacha Wang Bowawn Bawara Sab tan Mongkon. Siam, I believe, is the only country in the world at 5the present day which is ruled by two kings. The position of the Second King is, however, not clearly understood. His office would hardly correspond with our Vice-President, nor is he exactly a co-ruler, nor the successor to the Supreme King ; nevertheless his ' opinion and sanction are sought on important State policy, and his name is associated in treaties.' The late Sir John Bowring, a most excellent authority, says that ' the institution of a Second King is one of the L"], [198, "146 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT peculiarities of the Siamese usuages. He is not charged, as in the case of Japan [formerly], with the religious as distinguished from the civil functions of govern ment, but exercises a species of secondary or reflected authority, the limits of which did not appear to me to be clearly defined. ... He is said to dispose of one third of the State revenue, and to have at his command an army of about 2,000 men. He is generally a brother or near relation of the King. . . . His palace is nearly of the same extent as that of the First King. . . . He is surrounded with the same royal insignia as the First King, though somewhat less ostentatiously displayed ; and the same marks of honour and prostration are paid to his person. He has his ministers corresponding to those of the First King, and is supposed to take a more active part in the wars of the countiy than does the First King. It is usual to consult him on all important affairs of State. . . . He is expected to pay visits of ceremony to the First King,' &c. Thus it will be seen that the position of the Second King in the government of Siam is most peculiar and anomalous. On the occasion of our visit His Majesty the Second King intended to have a parade of some of his household troops, and had invited the Austrian and"], [199, "147 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SIAM German Consuls to accompany us to the palace ; Mr. Chandler, the Private Secretary, was also to be present, and act as marshal and interpreter. At three o'clock on the afternoon of the 15th inst. I repaired to the U.S. Consulate, and found General Partridge awaiting me, dressed in fuU military uniform, with an elegant sword dangling by his side. We then took boat \u2014 with the ' stars and stripes ' proudly floating at the stern and the Siamese rowers in hvery \u2014 to the house of Mr. Chandler, whom we found ready, in diplomatic dress, the brass buttons of his coat being stamped with the royal elephant of Siam, and together we walked to the palace gate, where we heard that the Austrian and German Consuls, with their secretaries, had preceded and were awaiting us in the royal reception hall. The guards presented arms as we entered the lofty gateway and walked upon a brick-laid path between what seemed to be the abodes of the Court servants and quarters for the troops. At the second gate (there are three walls about the palace) more guards saluted, and we passed across a small open square, surrounded by temples, salas, barracks, and dwellings, and were ushered into a large wat, which is now used as a waiting-room. Carpets had been spread upon the floor, and around a small table were sitting the German i 2"], [200, "148 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT Consul, Baron , a short gentleman in a captain's uniform (black, trimmed with red), wearing a faded order, and having a small glass cocked in one eye ; and at his side the Austrian Consul, a Bangkok merchant, in tasty diplomatic dress, with white kid gloves. Soon an aide-de-camp entered, and announced that His Majesty was quite ready to receive us. We were directed across the square already mentioned, past a low shed, in which was a European fire-engine, buckets, axes, and other paraphernalia for extin guishing a conflagration ; through another gateway, with more guards saluting ; by the King's carriage house, which we noticed contained several handsome Calcutta -built vehicles ; and through a smaU but very pretty garden, laid out in Chinese style, to the palace, which consists of a number of small two-storey houses, built according to the rules (or rather vagaries) of Chinese architecture. Ascending a very narrow marble staircase, we were met at its top by the King himself, who cordially shook hands with us all, each being introduced in turn by Mr. Chandler. We were ushered into a small parlour, having in the centre a table, around which we seated ourselves in comfort able arm-chairs, the King with us. The walls of the"], [201, "AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SIAM 149 room were hung with Chinese pictures, a chandelier for candles depended from the ceiling, a Brussels carpet lay upon the floor, a small book-rack stood in one corner, a Japanese lacquered etui in another, two guns with cloth covers in another, and two umbrellas in a stand at one side and a large gilt spittoon by the table completed the furniture of the room. His Majesty is a fine-looking man, with a large and powerful though not corpulent body, and a large, shapely head, the perceptive and reflective faculties being about equally well developed ; his hair is thin but black, eyes hazel-brown, teeth regular, but dis coloured by the use of the betel-nut, his age about fifty. In conversation the King smiles pleasantly, and impresses one as a man of more than ordinary ability, energy, and tact. He was dressed very plainly, with no orders or insignia, wearing only a blue-black silk jacket with stand-up collar and steel buttons ; a white linen vest, buttoning up close to the neck ; a drab silk panoung, dropping as low as the knees ; and a pair of cloth sandals, of peculiar construction, upon his otherwise bare feet. The King understands English pretty well, but is a little embarrassed in speaking that language with strangers. He is well acquainted with"], [202, "150 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT English literature, and possesses also a tolerable know ledge of Western science, philosophy, and politics. His Majesty has been named after our great General and first President, for preceding half a dozen Siamese titles, is that of ' George Washington,' and the King previous to mounting the throne was generally known among the European residents of Bangkok as ' Prince George.' Coffee and tea were brought in by three or four servants, who had been lying flat upon the floor of the verandah, and who crawled upon all fours into the room and, without lifting their eyes, placed the cups upon the table. And the King offered us from a mag nificent open-work gold box cigars and cigarettes of Siamese manufacture ; the latter, having wrappers made of the lotus flower, gave rise to a long conversation about the lotus, and also the Victoria Regia lily, &c. Then the talk was of birds of Paradise and phea sants ; and then the King questioned me concerning the King of Ava and Mandalay. During our call His Majesty showed us some maps of Siam, drawn on a very large scale from recent Government surveys, and executed in a most beautiful manner, with the pen, by Siamese artists ; the names of towns, moun tains, and rivers were marked in Eoman characters."], [203, "151 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SLAM After this, the King intimating to Mr. Chandler that some of his troops were ready to perform their drill for our amusement, we adjourned to the square, and found there some matting spread upon the ground and a row of chairs for our convenience. His Majesty soon followed in a sedan chair, carried by eight bearers, with the royal umbrella suspended above his head, and preceded and followed by attendants bearing gilded spears. He requested us to be seated, and took a chair upon the right, facing us. Immediately an attendant brought a small table, and placing it by the King's side, put upon it a magnificent gold-embossed sword, a gold betel-box, cigar-box, and a tray with two small cups of perfumed liquor, and at the royal feet laid a large gold-plated spittoon. We seated ourselves in a line, 'the General occupying the place of honour, and the parade began at once. There were two companies of troops, which marched in quick time from their barracks. The Second King has two thousand soldiers ; but these were picked men (or rather boys, for such they were), who guard the palace and its royal occupants, and of whose profi ciency in military tactics His Majesty is especially proud. They have had various instructors (drill-masters) at different times \u2014 French, English, and German ; the"], [204, "152 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT orders which we heard were given in broken Ger man. Their uniform of white duck is patterned after that worn by the British troops in India ; they wear also (mirabile dictu !) shoes and socks. The companies, in turn, went through the manual of arms, and per formed some skirmishing in remarkably good style ; the musket drill was better than that of many of our so-called ' crack ' regiments at home. After the THE ROYAL GUAKD: parade His Majesty's own brass band played for us. There were sixteen instrumentalists, led by a sergeant major, a mere youngster seven or eight years old and three feet in height ; indeed, none of the members of the band were more than twenty years of age ; their uniform was the same as that worn by the guards. They played in remarkably good time and tune, first the ' Siamese National Hymn,' a rather pretty composi tion ; and, second, a very familiar western waltz."], [205, "153 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SsAM Afterwards another band of musicians, who were older, but had had less practice, were ordered out, and they rendered a piece of dance music tolerably well. We then took leave, shaking hands with the King, and returned through the same gateway we had entered, the guards being drawn up in line and saluting as we passed. One morning at six o'clock, a few days afterwards I called, in company with General Partridge and Mr. Chandler, upon the Eegent of Siam, our object being to obtain information concerning an overland route to Saigon, in Cochin China (an excursion proposed for myself), and to procure, if possible, letters of introduc tion from His Grace to the governors of the several provinces through which it would be necessary to journey. We were to meet the high Siamese official on board his steam yacht ' Eising Sun ' (400 tons bur den) according to appointment. Being upon the Menam at such an early hour of the morning, I was enabled to see the bonzes going their daily rounds to gather the alms by which they live. Each priest was seen sitting in a little canoe, having before him a large iron pot and one or two bowls, and thus paddling from house to house receiving contributions \u2014 nowhere does Budhism hold so pure and absolute a sway as in Siam \u2014 of rice,"], [206, "154 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT fish, vegetables, fruit, cakes, &c, which were dealt out to them from large brass urns, generally by women, the priests never returning thanks, but paddling away as if they had conferred a favour upon the charitable donors instead of the contrary. I noticed as many as a dozen bonzes waiting around one house in turn. It is considered a deed of merit to give alms to these priests, and daily at sunrise they go the rounds of the city. And it is said that no less than ten thousand of them are fed solely in this manner. By Mr. Chandler I was presented to His Grace Chow Phya Sri Sury Wongse, the Eegent. We were invited to take seats at a small table, covered with the usually seen gold betel-boxes, spittoons, cigar-boxes, &c, His Grace sitting at its head. The Eegent is a short, thick set gentleman about sixty-five years of age ; he was dressed in much the same manner as the Second King on the occasion of our recent audience with His Majesty. The Eegent had an intellectual forehead and bright, intelligent eyes, but his mouth seemed to indicate a rather crabbed and petulant disposition, the latter perhaps caused by his old age and the anxieties of a busy and responsible life. He wears his hair in true Siamese fashion, viz. a tuft upon the crown of the head, the remainder being shaven about once a month"], [207, "155 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SLAM at a certain stage of the moon. While conversing with us he smoked a small Chinese pipe, and often rose and walked about the deck in a very nervous, fidgety manner. Mr. Chandler showed His Grace my sapphire THE EEGENT OF SIAM ring, remarking that it was presented by the present reigning King of Ava, Mounglon ; whereupon His Grace asked me several questions (it should be remem bered that Siam and Burma are old-time enemies)"], [208, "156 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT about Mandalay, the capital, and among others ' if the King went out much.' Upon my replying ' Never,' he said (in , English, the remainder of the conversation being in Siamese), with a merry twinkle of the eye, ' He 'fraid they shoot him.' 'No, your Grace,' I replied, ' it is not that ; King Mounglon fears if he ventures beyond his palace waUs that upon his return he will very likely find the gates closed and barred, and perhaps hear that another sits upon the royal throne instead,' at which answer he laughed heartily. The Eegent's attend ants were all of them girls, and very good-looking girls they were too ; they crept about the deck and noiselessly executed any orders received from their ' august lord.' Mi*. Chandler asked His Grace the best and safest route to the temples of Angkor, in eastern Siam, and he replied, ' That by Kabin, through the forests, about east : ' the other route being by sea down the gulf to Tang Yai, and then crossing overland to the ruins. The Eegent told us that the Governor of Kabin, having been in town on official business, had left only that very morning to return to his province ; that he would obtain for us a bullock-cart, horses, &c, upon our arrival there; and that he himself would request the Minister of Foreign Affairs, or his representative, to furnish us with the much-desired and very necessary"], [209, "157 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SIAM letters of introduction and passports, for use on our un usual and somewhat perilous excursion. Touching the tips of His Grace's fingers, we then withdrew, having heartily but respectfully thanked him for the honour of the interview and its favouring results. The prominent position in the government of Siam MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS which Chow Phya Sri Sury Wongse has occupied before the world for the past twenty years or more prompts me to add something further concerning this rare and admirable statesman. Ever since Sir John Bowring's visit in 1855 the Eegent has been 'the real ruler of Siam ; ' his ability and influence are most"], [210, "158 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT remarkable and his successes undoubted. At the time of the negotiation of the treaty of friendship and com merce between H.B.M. and the Kings of Siam the Eegent was Phra Kalahom, or Prime Minister (his son holds the office at present), and was one of the four commissioners appointed by the Supreme King to discuss and decide upon that treaty on the part of the Siamese Government. Sir John Bowring thus had much intercourse with His Grace, and in his ' Personal Journal ' has written a just estimate of his many excellent qualities. Says Sir John in one place, ' It is quite a novelty to hear a minister abuse the administration of which he is the head. He confirms his statements by facts ; he men tioned instances of bribery and extortion : in a word, his language is of the most high-minded patriotism.' And in another place he writes, ' The personal character of the Prime Minister is to me an object of much admiration. He is the most distinguished man of the greatest family in the empire. . . . He has again and again told me that if my policy is to save the people from oppression and the countiy from monopoly he shall labour with me, and if I succeed my name will be blest to all ages. He unveils abuses to me without disguise, and often with vehement eloquence. If he"], [211, "159 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING OF SIAM prove true to his profession [which he most honourably did] he is one of the noblest and most enlightened patriots the Oriental world has ever seen. To him Siam owes her fleet of merchant ships.' The sequel has proved that this rather florid praise was not exaggerated, and that the nobility of His Grace's nature has not been over-estimated. During the absence of the Supreme King in Singapore, Calcutta, and British India, and notwithstanding the Second King still remained at Bangkok, the vacillating helm of the ' ship of state,' with all its ' tearful interests,' was readily and confidently entrusted for the time to His Grace Chow Phya Sri Sury Wongse, Eegent of Siam."], [212, "160 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT CHAPTEE XIV. A DAY IN THE PALACE One day of my stay at Bangkok was pleasantly spent within the palace walls, with Mr. Chandler as my obliging cicerone. We went first to see the so-called ' white ' elephants. These are kept, fastened to stout posts, in large sheds, and covered with gilt canopies, in the same manner as the one, I saw at Mandalay, which belonged to the King of Ava. The first animal whose stable we entered was quite small, and possessed few of the peculiar characteristics of a ' dark-cream albino,' excepting perhaps the eyes. The keeper fed him with bananas, and caused him to make a salaam (a pro found salutation or bow) by raising his proboscis to his forehead for a moment and then gracefully lower ing it to the ground. In another shed we saw a larger and also whiter elephant, its body having the peculiar flesh-coloured appearance termed ' white.' Here there was, besides, a white monkey \u2014 ' white animals are the favourite abodes of transmigrating souls ' \u2014 kept to ward off bad spirits, as the attendant informed us."], [213, "161 A DAY' IN THE PALACE Sir John Bowring \u2014 and he is about the only person who has written at length on this subject \u2014 in a very interesting ' Chapter on Elephants,' tells us that the Budhists have a special reverence for white quad rupeds ; that he has himself seen a white monkey honoured with special attention. Also, that white elephants have been the cause of many a war, and their possession more an object of envy than the con quest of territory or the transitory glories of the battle field. In the money market a white elephant is almost beyond price. Ten thousand sovereigns ($50,000) would hardly represent its pecuniary value ; a hair from its tail is worth a Jew's ransom. 'It was my good fortune,' he says, 'to present [in 1855] to the First King of Siam (the Siamese have two kings exercising supreme authority) presents with which I had been charged by my royal mistress. I received many presents in return ; but the monarch placed in my hand a golden box, locked with a golden key, and he informed me the box contained a gift far more valuable than all the rest, and that was a few hairs of the white elephant. And perhaps it may be well to state why the white elephant is so specially reve renced. ' Because it is believed that Budha, the divine M"], [214, "162 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT emanation from the Deity, must necessarily, in his multitudinous metamorphoses or transmissions through all existences, and through millions of aeons, delight to abide for some time in that grand incarnation of purity which is represented by the white elephant. While the bonzes teach that there is no spot in the heavens above, or the earth below, or the waters under the earth, which is not visited in the peregrinations of the divinity \u2014 whose every stage or step is towards purification \u2014 they hold that his tarrying may be longer in the white elephant than in any other abode, and that in the possession of the sacred creature they may possess the presence of Budha himself. It is known that the Cingalese have been kept in subjection by the belief that their rulers have a tooth of Budha in the temple of Kandy, and that on various tracts of the East impressions of the foot of Budha are reverenced, and are the objects of weary pilgrimages to places which can only be reached with difficulty ; but with the white elephant some vague notions of a vital Budha are associated, and there can be no doubt that the marvellous sagacity of the creature has served to strengthen their religious prejudices. Siamese are known to whisper their secrets into an elephant's ear, and to ask a solution of their perplexities by some sign"], [215, "163 A DAY IN THE PALACE or movement. And most assuredly there is more sense and reason in the worship of an intelligent beast than in that of stocks and stones, the work of men's hands. ' And yet,' continues Sir John, ' after all the white elephant is not white, nor anything like it. It is of a coffee colour ; not of unburnt, but of burnt coffee \u2014 dull brownish yellow or yellowish brown \u2014 white only by contrast with his darker brother. The last which reached Bangkok was caught in the woods. The King and Court went a long way out into the country to meet him, aud he was conducted with a* grand pro cession, much pomp, and music, and flying banners, to the capital. There a grand mansion awaited him, and several of the leading nobility were appointed his cus todians. The walls were painted to represent forests, no doubt to remind him of his native haunts, and to console him in his absence from them. AU his wants were sedulously provided for, and in his \" walks abroad,\" when \" many men he saw,\" he was escorted by music and caparisoned by costly vestments. His grandest and farthest promenades were to bathe in the river, when other elephants were in attendance, honoured by being made auxiliaries to his grandeur. Now and then the two sovereigns sought his presence, M 2"], [216, "164 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT but I did not learn that his dignity condescended to oblige them with any special notice. But he wanted no addition to his dignity. Everything associated with majesty and rank bore his image. A white elephant is the badge of distinction. The royal flags and seals, medals and moneys \u2014 on all sides the white elephant is the national emblem, as the cross among Christians or the crescent among Turks ; and the Siamese are prouder of it than Americans, Eussians, Germans, or French are of their eagles, or Spaniards of the golden fleece. The Bourbon Orifiamme, the British Union Jack, show but faintly in the presence of the white elephant.' Thus it will be seen that in Siam the ' white ' elephant, as in the kingdom of Ava, is a grave and important ap pendage of state, and that the King of Siam lays quite as just claim to the coveted and pompous titles of ' Lord of the Celestial Elephant ' and ' Master of Many White Elephants ' as does His Majesty of Ava. In the arsenal of artillery were some enormous brass cannon, said to have been made under the direction of the Portuguese. One of them was full twenty feet in length, mounted on a very clumsy wooden carriage ; another must have had a bore of eighteen inches in diameter ; another was engraved with the date 1627 and a Latin inscription. A plain two-storey building"], [217, ""], [218, "'EJirLE OF THE EMERALD IDl"], [219, "165 A DAY IN THE PALACE within the second wall had a sign over its door which read ' Coining Manufacture ' \u2014 -some of the late King's droll English. We were shown through this establish ment \u2014 the Eoyal Mint. The machinery is of English make, though none but Siamese workmen are em ployed. At the time of our visit the Mint was coining silver ticals (worth about 60 cts.) The courts of justice are simply large sheds with matted floors, like those in Mandalay. We could not obtain admittance to the Audience Hall ; it is a large, fantastic-shaped building, with a lofty spire from its centre. The Wat Phran Kean, or Temple of the Emerald Idol, is the finest of its class in Siam. The model is similar to the others, but the workmanship, both ex teriorly and interiorly, is of a much higher order. The walls are covered with admirably executed paint ings ; the floor is laid over with brass bricks. The altar, built in the shape of a pyramid, about sixty feet high, is surmounted by the ' Emerald Idol ' \u2014 an image twelve inches in height and eight in width. ' Into the virgin gold 6f which its hair and collar is composed,' says a recent observer, ' must have been stirred, while the metal was yet molten, crystals, topazes, sapphires, rubies, onyxes, amethysts, and diamonds \u2014 the stones crude and rudely cut, and blended in such proportions"], [220, "166 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT as might enhance to the utmost imaginable limit the beauty and the cost of the admired effigy. ' On the altar there are many large images covered with pure gold, whose robes are ornamented with genuine pre cious stones ; also some lusus natur\u0153, as extra ordinarily formed tusks of the elephant and rhinoceros, beautifully carved marble statues, clocks, golden altar-utensils, and garments which belonged to the late King. The reigning monarch worships in this temple, and here also the nobles take the oath of allegiance. On either side of the principal entrance stand two life-size marble statues, whose history I could not learn, of Peter, ' the Apostle of Jesus Christ,' and of Ceres, the Eoman goddess of agriculture. Near this wat is a small pagoda which, in an enormous pyramidal cabinet of ebony and mother-of-pearl, con tains the Budhist sacred books. A carpet made of silver wire lies upon the floor. Adjoining this is a large pagoda which has been ten years in building, and has already cost over $200,000 ; and two years more will be necessary for its completion. The interior side of the wall which surrounds the Temple of the Emerald Idol is covered with gorgeous paintings of old Siamese fables and superstitions. The palace where the Supreme King resides cousists"], [221, "167 A DAY IN THE PALACE of a large number of odd-looking houses crowded together within the third wall. Very many buildings could not be shown us because of the absence of the King, and some others because they were undergoing repairs at that time. An absurd custom prevails, which requires that at the close of each reign all the temples and most of the palace buildings shall be torn down and new ones erected in their places, and if the buildings themselves are not removed, at least their ornaments and other accessories are carried away. We next visited the temple Wat Poh, outside the palace walls, in which is a ' reclining ' Budha, 145 feet in length, and 65 in height at the shoulders. It is built of brick and chunam, thickly covered with leaf gold. The soles of the feet, which are sixteen feet in length, are covered with the mystic symbols peculiar to a Budha, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and finished with gold-leaf. The proposed overland excursion to the ruins at Angkor was fast taking shape, and for four or five clays I Avas busily engaged in making the necessary prepa rations. I had invited the Eev. Mr. MacFarland, of Pechaburi, and General Partridge to accompany me, and to my delight both had accepted. We thought a month only would be requisite to accomplish the entire"], [222, "168 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT journey to Angkor and the return to Bangkok. I proposed to go on alone to Panompin, the capital of Cambodia, and thence down the great Makong river to Saigon, in Cochin China ; but the official duties of both my companions would compel them, however unwillingly, to return direct to Bangkok. First, it was necessary to provide ' house ' boats for the canal and river travel, in which we hoped to accomplish one third of the distance ; and these the General obtained, together with interpreters, boatmen, and servants. He secured as cook a strong and tough Chinaman named ' Deng,' who spoke English pretty well, and who was one of the ' boys ' whom M. Henri Mouhot, the French naturalist, took with him up to Lonang Prabang, a town in north-eastern Siam ; and who, with another ' boy,' buried there the brave traveller (who died of the terrible fever, 1861), and returning, brought his journal and letters to Bangkok. In his book of ' Travels in India, China, Cambodia, and Laos ' M. Mouhot tells some amusing stories about the character and morals of this ' Deng ;' one of these relates that his attendant had a little defeat.

A few days ago he was seized with this devouring thirst, and profiting by my absence for only a few minutes, he opened my chest and hastily laid hands on the first bottle which presented itself, great part of the contents of which he swallowed at one gulp. I came back just as he was wiping his mouth with his shirt sleeve, and it would be impossible to describe his contortions and grimaces as he screamed out that he was poisoned. He had had the bad luck to get hold of my bottle of ink ; his face was smeared with it, and his shirt was pretty well sprinkled. It was a famous lesson for him, and I think it will be some time before he tries my stores again.' But ' Deng ' was a capital cook, M. Mouhot tells us, and so we expected great things of him ; and we were not afterwards in any way disappointed, for he proved throughout one of our most faithful, hard working, and obliging servants. A part of my duty was to select and purchase the food supplies \u2014 liquors and provisions in bottles and tins ; ale, brandy, sherry, and claret ; meats, vege tables, biscuits, soups, condiments, &c. ; and potatoes, rice, onions, hams, coffee and tea in bulk. We intended to rely principally upon these, though we"], [224, "170 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT also proposed to eke out our preserved, condensed, and desiccated victuals with the produce of the country through which we would journey, viz. rice, fish, poultry, eggs, and various fruits.

However, Mr. MacFarland's servant was a Cambodian by birth, and, though he had lived nearly all his hfe in Siam, still remembered sufficient of his native tongue to be of considerable service to us. We took an assortment of medicines, especially a liberal supply of quinine, three grains of which we were recommended to take every morning in our coffee by Dr. Hutchinson. Each one had his mattress, blankets, and mosquito netting, though all carried as little personal baggage as con sisted with comfort and health. The offensive and defensive (especially) weapons of the party compre hended two revolvers and two or three large bowie knives. We also carried a few scientific instruments and writing and drawing materials, maps of the countiy, a selection of books and old magazines, and I packed in my waterproof bag besides a few presents for the King of Cambodia, Governor of Siamrap, and some other great men.

The great floating city, bathed in the pale moonlight, and at the same time illumined with ten thousand coloured lanterns, presents a strange, weird appearance as our boats swing away from the Consulate wharf, with their prows headed up the whirling Menam ; the native boatmen break out in wild, whimsical, cadenced songs, keeping time to the regular, almost noiseless dip of their oars ; as we sail along we hear the pariah dogs growling over their midnight prey, and we distinguish also a few strains, a trifle more melodious, of the monotonous music of a Chinese theatrical booth ; and thus standing upon deck, with the flag of our so far away country floating over us, we wave a hasty adieu to Bangkok \u2014 the eastern Venice \u2014 and our many kind friends, and turning away, enter a narrow canal leading directly to the east \u2014 towards the very heart of Siam."], [229, "175 ACROSS SOUTHERN SIAM CHAPTEE XV. ACROSS SOUTHERN SIAM The boats were anchored about midnight, and in the spacious cabins we slept soundly until morning. With daylight we saw the canal was lined with bamboo huts, and that passing us were many boats on their way to Bangkok with market stuffs. In the middle of the day we stopped for an hour to allow the men rest and time for eating their fish and rice. The canal continued very narrow during the remainder of the day ; its sides were covered with a thin strip of cocoa palms and bamboos, but the country beyond was a vast plain of rank jungle grass, with an occasional hut in sight, or a small village of a dozen or more dwelhngs, and always a cock-pit, licensed by, and a source of great revenue to, the Government. The huts were very dilapidated. A rule with the Siamese is never to repair a building, but to live in it until it almost falls upon their heads. The people appeared poor, and were certainly shockingly dirty. The mosquitoes proved"], [230, "176 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT very troublesome, becoming towards evening almost unbearable. We noticed that all the natives slept within curtains, and that the huge buffalo-cows were coralled in small swampy enclosures, in which they wallowed, covering themselves with mud and water as a protection against the stinging pests. At night we entered the nettings we were so careful not to leave behind, but no such thing as ' balmy sleep ' could be obtained ; there seemed to be quite as many mosquitoes within as without the curtains. They made a buzzing as of a thousand bees ; the air was literally thick and heavy with them. The only respite we had from their attacks was when completely enveloped in our blankets ; but this was simply ' from the frying-pan into the fire,' for the action nearly suffocated us. In the morning the General said he counted fifty of the merciless insects which were hanging on the inner side of his curtains, in a semi-torpid state, after the night's sanguinary foray ; and my face was so red and swollen as scarcely to be recognisable by my companions. On the morning of the second day from Bangkok we enter the Bang pa Kong river, which we propose to ascend about fifty miles to Pachim, the residence of a governor ; and then, if possible, we shall go on by water to Kabin, thirty or forty miles farther. In an"], [231, "177 ACROSS SOUTHERN SIAM old wat where we breakfasted, thrown over a small image of Budha, was a piece of yellow cloth, about a foot in length and two inches in width, upon which was written in Siamese characters, ' This cloth I, Nang Yai, send to my aunt Sim ; if anybody steals it, may he go to hell.' From which we understood that the cloth was consecrated to the memory of Nang's transmigrating aunt, and that he entertained pretty strong and precise feelings towards the person who should purloin the haUowed offering. The Bang pa Kong river is three or four hundred feet in width, deep, with strong tides and a very tortuous course ; we did not pass a straight reach as much as an eighth of a mile in length. In the afternoon we observed an alligator about eight feet long, with open, cavernous mouth and sleepy, half-closed eyes, lying in the tall grass on the bank, enjoying the bright rays of the sun. Arrived at Pachim, the Governor sent us an invita tion to pass the night in a house which he had prepared for our reception (we had sent a messenger ahead to herald our approach), but we preferred sleeping on board the boats. The Governor's house we saw on the following morning. It is a large bamboo building, raised upon piles, and in the long room, having one side open, His Excellency received our party. Before us stood an x"], [232, "178 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT old gentleman of short stature, intelligent and amiable countenance, with grey hair, and teeth much blackened by use of the betel. His dress was a silk coat and buff cloth waistcoat, with a simple panoung, and bare legs and feet ; he wore besides a pair of immense spec tacles. The room made a rather primitive ' audience chamber,' containing as it did only a small sofa, beyond which were some emblems of authority \u2014 large umbrellas, a bamboo mat, chandeliers hanging from the beams, and two paroquets with rich plumage in cages at either end ; and there were also two clocks, both of which insisted upon indicating that the hour (at seven in the morning) was half-past one. Lying upon their hips, prostrate upon the floor, were a dozen or more officers and attendants. We conversed about half an hour with the Governor, through the missionary as interpreter. He promised to obtain three ponies for us, and four bullock-carts for our servants and baggage, and at taking leave he sent with us a present of meat and fish, asking what other provisions we were de sirous of receiving.

Anchored before the town were about fifty boats, some of them of large size, and owned by Chinamen ; and back of the town the Government authorities were building a citadel and palace, the brick walls of which are to be six feet in breadth, and are to enclose a section of land about eight acres in extent. A saw-mill and brick-yard are in operation, preparing the materials of construction ; we visited the latter. The work is mostly done by women. The bricks are made of clay and paddy husks, and are burnt : they sell for ,#2.40 a thousand, delivered in Bangkok. At the entrance of the new citadel we saw a remarkable natural gateway, formed by two trees (the poh species, the sacred tree of the Siamese, being that under which Budha is said to have expired when he left this world), about two feet in diameter at their bases, joining and growing together in the form of a perfect arch twenty feet from the ground, and towering up in a single trunk thirty feet higher, and spreading out in grand masses of bright green fohage.

We had an opportunity also to witness the native method of grinding paddy \u2014 hulling the grain \u2014 in a low bamboo shed. The mill consisted of two parts, of course, but, instead of the usual coarse stones, they were made of thin slabs of hard wood embedded in mud and surrounded by wicker-work. The motive power was a man and a woman, who worked this primitive machine by means of a long pole and a cross-piece of bamboo at one end, with the other fastened in a loose socket to the upper mill-stone (or rather mud and wood basket), it being the same principle as that applied to om* grindstone. In the morning there came as a present from the Governor two kinds of dried fish, some eggs, oranges, and cocoa-nuts, and in the evening a dozen of fowls. We arose at day sight on the 29th of January, removed our baggage from the boats, and sent them back to Bangkok, as from this point we were to travel"], [235, "181 ACROSS SOUTHERN SIAM by land.

The horses, or rather ponies, were so small and thin that we greatly feared their abihty to bear us. The General had brought his own saddle and bridle from the Consulate, but the missionary and myself were to use native seats and head-stalls. The Siamese simply ride upon a cushion placed upon the horse's back, and held in position by the rider's knees and legs, Avithout stirrups, and Avith a most primitive bridle, made usually of coarse tAvine.

The bullocks are black, very large and powerful ; they are driven, with a line passed through the nostrils, as we direct horses. Most singular in appearance are the native carts.

The wheels are of solid wood, and about five feet in diameter ; they turn upon small wooden axles. The Governor sent us a final present of sugar, cucumbers, and fried cakes, and nearly the entire toAvn assembled to see us depart. The road at first led over an even plain, for the most part covered with coarse grass, and in the distance were forests and a low range of blue mountains. Some paddy was cultivated by the road side, but few dwellings, hoAvever, Avere seen. We on horseback travelled at the rate of three miles an hour, and the carts folloAved at about a mile per hour less. Having crossed the Bang pa Kong river, we shortly afterwards entered the viUage of Chantakan, distant fifteen miles from Pachim, and of about the same size \u2014 and were escorted by some of the people with torches to the residence of the Deputy-Governor. Instructions from the Governor of Pachim had pre ceded us, and this official had prepared for our use two neAvly built salas, where, after we were comfortably settled, he sent us a ready-cooked (Siamese) dinner. As our provisions had not yet arrived, we were glad as well as curious to partake of the native food. It was served upon three little"], [237, "ACROSS SOUTHERN SIAM 183 wooden stands, half a dozen bowls upon each ; there was neither knife, fork, nor spoon : Siamese eat with their fingers, and so did we. There Avas set before us fish cooked in five different styles, boiled rice, salad, and condiments, including, of course, namphrik, Avhich, however, was made in a new way, mixed Avith fish oil and some other articles not very inviting to American palates; Avater for drinking was brought in large brass bowls. Before we had quite finished the repast three spoons Avere brought us \u2014 one of iron, another of porcelain, and another of mother-of-pearl, the latter being a clear, silvery shell, and handsomely cut.

There were a goodly number of tall trees to be seen this day ; especially interesting was a species from which the natives obtain a lubri cating oil.

We saw the prairie-grass and woods burning in many places, and everywhere there were blackened and charred remains of recent fires, Avhich the natives say are accidentally started or produced, perhaps by a match or a discarded cigar stump. They burn for months at a time, sometimes quietly simmering at the foot of an old tree, from which a sudden strong wind Avill scatter sparks into some dry vegetable matter, which of course will at once blaze up, and so the fire will spread and travel over immense districts of country.

Kabin we found tu be a Laos town of about a thousand inhabitants. The Governor was absent when we arrived, but a subordinate made us comfort able in the public sala, while notice Avas sent to His Excellency of the arrival of the ' farangs ' (foreigners).

This latter civility we declined, and Avith the officer's permission gave the dinner to our servants : there was sufficient for all, and they exceedingly enjoyed Avhat Avas to them, we doubted not, a most royal feast. In the evening the Governor called, an ' oldish ' gentleman, with a pleasing face and engaging manners, dressed in a blue silk panoung and red and grey silk jacket, his head and feet being of course bare. He answered the missionary's questions and also our OAvn so quickly and decidedly as to prove a most thorough acquaintance with his special province. He told us that the gold mine near there, worked entirely by Siamese, was paying pretty Avell at the time ; and he showed us some of the gold, which had been manufactured into little filigree Avorkboxes, for holding tobacco. Their workmanship was rude, but the gold is said to be the most ductile in the Avorld ; its colour is a dark, dull yelloAv, and it appears very soft.

We Avere"], [240, "186 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT not expected to make any return or present to the servants we employed on the road ; still we thought it right to aAvard them something when faithful, and so we paid for the use of our animals and their drivers and attendants at the rate of half a tical each per diem. We entered this day upon the ' grand military road ' built by the Siamese some thirty-five or forty years since for the easier transport of troops to the remote districts of their kingdom \u2014 parts of Cambodia and Cochin China, then recently annexed. The road was in such excellent condition, the General remarked, that over it might easUy be drawn the heaviest artillery.

And again this morning Ave heard another ludicrous expression of distance ; a toAvn was ' as far as a cock could crow,' and we found it to be nearly half a mile \u2014 rather a far-fetched croAV.

We next entered a region of very dense forest, through Avhich the road was evenly cut, the branches of the trees joining just above our heads and making a complete shade.

Tigers (Avild), elephants, and other ferocious animals abound hereabouts, and our guides told us it would not be safe to travel at night ; even during the day we carried loaded revolvers, and each of our ' boys ' had large knives or two-edged daggers attached to cords and worn around their necks. On the march we distinguished"], [242, "188 THE LAND OF THE AVIHTE ELEPHANT the tracks of elephants and panthers, and at night listened to the howls of jackals prowling around our camp. The screams of monkeys, though Ave did not often see the wary little animals, the notes of peacocks, quails, parrots, and many unknown birds were also heard. One day, as Ave were quietly jogging along, we observed two immense birds standing together upon the grassy plain ; they appeared to be of the adjutant species, with a long bill, black neck, broad white stripe round the body, black tail, and very long red legs, and were about four feet in height. As Ave journeyed on we also saw great turkey-buzzards, and occasionally a herd of red deer. It is customary with the natives to ensnare the latter by driving them into narrow enclosures, in which strong nets have been spread. It Avas our practice to walk as much as eight miles every day, the remainder being accomplished on horseback ; and the sun being excessively hot, at noon and night we were, of course, much exhausted. At such times two or three grains of quinine soon wrought a happy change in our feelings. Quinine taken as a precaution, or an (almost) preventer of fever, is an invaluable medicine everywhere in the tropics.

At a night bivouac each of our attendants has his especial duty. The baggage and provision carts are usually two or three hours behind us, as we make about an hour more than they do on the road. If we are so fortunate as to obtain an old sola for the night, the carts are driven to its side, and the drivers at once unyoke the oxen and lead them off to graze at the"], [244, "190 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT edge of the forest.

This is the ' draught,' and through this aperture the fire is fed with light, dry fuel. ' Imm,' the Chinese butler, soon has our table ' set,' i.e. the plates and dishes are placed on a large bamboo mat upon the floor, and before long the meal itself is thus announced : ' Master, master, dinny have got leady.' But prior to this our dusty travelling clothes have been removed, we have bathed, and dressed in clean and cool baju and pyjamas (loose jacket and drawers of thin silk or linen), and we now recline at length upon our beds, much after the manner of the ancient Eomans at their symposia, \u2014 and partake of the frugal repast.

It is simply an oblong Avooden box (five feet in length, two and a half in width, and one foot in depth), which fits snugly to the elephant's back ; it has a circular bamboo top or cover, five or six feet in height, which rises from the two ends, and has curtains provided for both the front and rear sides.

There is no carving to be seen except a httle arabesque work upon the narrow stone coping. No keystone being employed, and the stones not being smoothed upon their tops, the arches have consequently many of them broken in, and all are much dilapidated. The bridge exhibits marks of great age ; most of the stone facing has been thrown down ; the top of the bridge is overgrown with shrubs, and in"], [256, "200 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT one or two places quite large trees have grown up, fastening their roots into the rich debris between the blocks of stone. Some of these latter have been worn round and nearly smooth, by the action of running Avater apparently ; many blocks have small holes in them, as if by this means they had been hfted and placed in position. There are no other ruins to be seen near the bridge except two small heaps of stone and rubbish in the centre of a shalloAV lake. This bridge, which the natives in their floAvery diction style Taphan-theph \u2014 the ' Celestial,' ' Angels',' or ' Shining Bridge ' (as it may be variously translated)- was probably built about the same time as the temples and palaces of Angkor, when that city was the capital of Cambodia \u2014 many hundred years since. We crossed Taphan-theph upon our elephants, and soon after halted for tiffin under the shade of some large trees. In the afternoon I had a long ride in one of the little passenger bullock-carts. The body of this vehicle looks very much like a huge barrel ; it is made of bamboo covered with leaves, but so narroAv is it that one has to sit cross-legged, and so low is it that when thus sitting it is impossible to wear one's hat.

The bullocks usually bear strings of Avooden clapper-bells around their necks, and when trotting fast their jingling sound reminds one someAvhat of the sleigh-bells in winter at home. Upon a good, level road this mode of conveyance is not disagreeable, but little of the countiy through Avhich one is riding can, however, be seen. Siamrap we found to be a town \u2014 of about a thousand inhabitants \u2014 pleasantly situated upon the banks of a small river, and three and a half miles distant from the ruins at Angkor. We were received in the public sala by the Palat (an inferior provincial officer), who brought us an invitation from the Governor to dine with him ; but this hospitality we Avere obliged to decline, feeling quite exhausted after our day's travel. It seemed that we had arrived in Siamrap at a time of unusual festivity. The daughter of the Governor was about to be married to the cousin of the Governor of Battambong \u2014 a large province to the south-west \u2014 and great preparations for the happy event were going forwards. After Ave had unpacked some of the baggage the Governor sent us a very nice"], [258, "202 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT Siamese (though served in European style) dinner upon a silver tray ; there Avas soup in a large blue China tureen, a great dish of boiled rice, and a variety of stewed meats and condiments in small bowls : knives and forks were provided and a table and chairs brought, a cloth laid, and upon it (mirabile visu !) a ' reg'lar down-east ' tallow-dip was placed, the the wick being quite two-thirds of its size, and it burning at about the rate of an inch a minute. After dinner we had a long conversation, through ' Henry ' as medium, Avith the chief men of the village, who asked questions \u2014 many very absurd ones too \u2014 much faster than we could answer them.

It was received with distinguished ceremony on a golden salver, with a conspicuous display of white umbrellas ; and afterwards Ave Avere invited to an interview.

Lower doAvn the river were several canoes and barges, holloAved out of single trunks of trees, which were as much as forty feet in length and eight feet in beam or breadth ; one had a cabin of palm leaves built in its centre, and a grass thatch extending over it from stem to stern. These canoes and large boats are intended rather for use on Lake Thalaysap, eight miles distant, being too unwieldy and of too great draught to penetrate far up the river. The walls of Siamrap, built of brick and stone, are twelve feet in height and about half a mile in cir cumference ; they have bastions at the corners, and openings in the parapet for cannon. The Governor afterwards told the General that forty years ago each of these embrasures \u2014 there are 806 of them \u2014 was occupied by a cannon, but having since become rusty and otherwise out of repair, they have all been removed. There are two gates on the eastern side"], [260, "204 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT and one on each of the others.

During the interview the Governor ordered his own band of fourteen instruments to play for our amusement.

Some have supposed Nagkon Wat to be but 1,400 years old, to have been built by different kings, and to have been completed by one who was a Budhist.

'And besides the similar regularity of feature, there are the same long beards, straight langontis (waistcloths), and even the same Aveapons and musical instruments.' It is M. Mouhot's belief that, without exaggeration, some of the oldest parts of Angkor may be fixed at more than 2,000 years ago, and the more recent portions not much later.

Another circumstance of considerable inte- rest, and one mentioned by both Dr. Bastian and M.

Yes, inscriptions truly there are ; some can be deciphered and some can not, but those which can be read only give descriptions of offerings made by different donors, with some allusions to religious cere monies and mythological objects.

Near the monastery of Phrakeoh is an artificial lake called Sasong (the Eoyal Lake), built by the kings of Pentaphrohm, and surrounded with pleasure houses for their recreation. Dr. Bastian thinks that it must have been a work of immense labour, and that the whole population of Cambodia of to-day Avould scarcely be able to raise such a gigantic structure. The lake of Sasong he describes as being ' of oblong shape, about 2,000 feet broad and 4,000 feet long, and sur rounded by a high embankment of solid masonry. Some of the blocks are fourteen to sixteen feet long and highly finished.

We had been but two or three days at the Nagkon Wat, Avhen there came an invitation from the Governor to visit him at Siamrap. So mounting our elephants early in the morning, Ave returned to our old sala, not far distant from the palace gate. Soon after our arrival came the promised letter of introduction from the Governor of Siamrap to the Prime Minister of Cambodia, requesting him to obtain me an audience with His Majesty. It was written in the Cambodian language, though accompanied by a Siamese translation, Avhich latter ' Henry,' the Consulate interpreter, rendered into literal English for my instruction and amusement. It read as follows : \u2014 ' The letter of Phraya-nu-pap-Tripoph, the Governor of the Province of Siamrap, sent to Phraya-Kralahome at the city of Panompin, stating that the American Consul brought a letter with the seal of Chow- Phraya-Pootarupai out to the Governor of the Province of Siamrap, the substance of Avhich is as follows: \u2014"], [311, "A CAMBODIAN MARRIAGE FESTIVAL 231 Mr. the American Consul wished to travel to the ruins of Nagkon Wat and Nagkon Thorn, and if Mr. Consul wished to travel to any place whatever, let the Governor prepare everything that he requires (to see it).

During the evening His Excellency asked if I would not hke to accompany a party of Chinese who were going to Panompin for business purposes ; he remarked they were ready to start at once, but, if agreeable, he would detain them until we had seen all the ruins of Angkor. The Governor's kind proposal was accepted with many thanks. February the 15th was the day appointed for the marriage festival in the palace, but I being sick, my companions thought it imprudent for me to attend. However, in the evening the missionary gave me a detailed account of the entire proceedings. He said that when they reached the Governor's palace the ceremony had just commenced. That they were ushered, amid a tremendous din of gongs, into a large sala beyond the reception hall, where Avere seated the Governor and about a hundred noblemen and invited guests ; the bridegroom, a young man about twenty years of age, elegantly attired in silk jacket and panoung, was also there. By the time the farangs were seated, a procession \u2014 headed by the bride, sup ported on either hand by demure-looking matrons \u2014 composed principally of aged or married women, all elegantly attired, entered and slowly marched towards"], [316, "236 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT the Governor. The bride was not particularly interest ing as regards personal charms ; she was young, how ever, and dressed richly and in good taste. Besides her silk panoung she wore a gold-embroidered scarf upon her shoulders, also gold rings upon her singers, bracelets upon her wrists, and armlets above the elbows. The bride took up her position near the bridegroom, both sitting upon the floor, but not looking towards each other ; in fact, throughout the entire ceremony they both were perfectly impassive and nonchalant. The marriage ceremony proper now began. A number of wax candles Avere brought in a salver, and then lighted by one of the nobles. The silver Avaiter was then passed round before the company eight times, each one in turn saluting the couple and wishing them good fortune by Avaving or bloAving the smoke towards them, thus ex pressing something hke the old English custom of throw ing the slipper after a newly-married couple \u2014 the band of string and reed instruments playing the meanwhile. Two large velvet cushions having been previously placed before the bride and bridegroom, and upon them a large sword, the leader of the lacon (theatricals) now came forward and went through, for a few moments, a most fantastical sword exercise. Dishes had been placed before the unsusceptible couple upon the floor,"], [317, "A CAMBODIAN MARRIAGE FESTIVAL 237 with covers upon them, which latter the lacon man removed during his flourishes, disclosing to view some cooked fowls or ducks ; nothing Avas eaten, hoAvever. Next the hands of the expectant couple were bound together, and to each other, with silken threads by the women attendants \u2014 probably some near relatives. Thus were they truly 'joined together ' in Budhistic wedlock. And this completed the nuptial ceremony. AfterAvards a grand banquel Avas served in the reception room, the Governor himself officiating. The nobles and guests partook of the viands, sitting apart at little tables by themselves. The farangs occupied the place of honour at the end of the hall ; and they pronounced the dinner excellent.

THE RUINS OF ANGKOR \u2014 THE CITY AND ENVIRONS Angkor, styled by the natives Nagkon Thorn, the Great City, is situated about two and a half miles north-Avest of Nagkon Wat, and a good road leads there, through dense forests of immense oil and poh trees. Angkor is supposed to have been the capital of the ancient kingdom of Khaman, though Ave know little or nothing of its history. There is a tradition preserved which sets forth, in most extravagant and improbable manner, that the kingdom had twenty kings avIio paid tribute to it ; that its army consisted of 70,000 war elephants, 200,000 horsemen, and 5,000,000 foot soldiers ; and that its ' royal treasury occupied a space of more than 300 miles.' The ancient city Avas two and a half miles in length and two and a quarter miles in width, surrounded by three walls, the outermost of which, the natives say, it would require an entire day to circumambulate. The outer wall is the only one now at all preserved. It is about tAventy feet in height"], [320, "240 THE LAND OF THE AA'HITE ELEPHANT and ten in width, built of large square blocks of A*olcanic rock, and has tAvo gates upon the eastern side and one upon each of the others. We entered by the south gateway \u2014 a pyramidal structure, perhaps fifty feet in height, rising above a pointed arch. On the top of this gateway was growing a poh tree, Avith a trunk as much as three feet in diameter, sending its roots down through and over the huge blocks of stone into the rich earth. The area within the Avails is now mostly overgroAvn with jungle. About a mile north from the gate is a colossal statue of Budha, formed of large stones, and evidently of modern fabrication. A little farther on, in the midst of the forest, there are the ruins, of a large wat \u2014 a one-storey building, enclosed within high Avails, surmounted by twenty-five stone pagodas disposed in parallel rows. These pagodas are about fifty feet in height, except the centre one, wiiich was originally at least a hundred, and the exterior of each is Avorkcd into colossal faces of Budha \u2014 eight feet long by four in width \u2014 upon the four sides.

To the poh trees is due in great part the present ruinous WOODEN IDOL state of this wat, for, having sprung up near or on the tops of the pagodas, they send their roots doAvn through the joints of the stones, forcing them out of place, and, besides, the wind, blowing against their R"], [322, "242 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT thick and widespread foliage, works almost like a lever upon the roots. Around the bases of the central pagoda are numerous small idol-cells, and there are some female figures carved upon the doors of these cells which are surely of Hindoo origin ; besides the corresponding features, they wear the long sarong and the round anklets of that nation. It is doubtful if these grand monuments can defy time much longer ; some of the blocks of stone in the pagodas are sepa- rated by as much as an inch ; many seem only to require a touch to topple them to the ground ; some chambers are entirely choked up by their roofs having fallen, and over and through all the ruins the para- sitical poh tree has spread its roots and reared aloft its glossy green head (we saw a solid block of stone, ten feet in length, which Avas supported in a nearly horizontal position solely by the roots of an immense poh tree, grown interlaced around one end of it), and shrubs and coarse grass now riot where once the praises of the great Budha \u2014 ' the Illuminator of the World ' \u2014 resounded through the halls.

On the opposite side of THE LEPER KING the gateway are pictures in stone, a battle and a military procession. The famous statue of the Leper King is carved from sandstone in a sitting posture.

They have somewhat naturalised (if a foreigner) and very much travestied their royal ancestor (if indeed such he be) by blackening his teeth, rouging his lips, and gilding his forehead. The precise history of the Leper King has not been determined. There is one legendary tradition that Angkor Avas founded in fulfilment of a vow by a king Avho was a leper. Another tradition says that to an Egyptian king, who for some sacrilegious deed was turned into a leper, must be ascribed the authorship of Angkor."], [325, "245 RUINS OF ANGKOR\u2014 THE CITY AND ENVIRONS The old city besides, as has been already mentioned, is said by the modern Cambodians to have been built by the angels or by the giants, or to have sprung up from the ground. But all tliese explanations and the traditions as well are most vague, uncertain, and un satisfactory. Agreeably to the legend referring the founding of Angkor to an Egyptian king, and some fancied resemblances between the religion of Budha and that of ancient Egypt, a late writer in the 'National Quarterly Eeview ' (Vol. XXVI. No. LI. art. ' Siam and the Siamese ') seems to think these ' point to the fact that at some veiy remote period the Egyptians, or a people identical with them, held sway over that portion of the globe which comprises Siam, Cambodia, and Cochin China.' But the founding of Angkor is also attributed, and by the most learned Cambodian historians of the present day, to a Prince of Eoma \u2014 Eoma being placed by them at the western end of the world \u2014 while Egypt never has occupied that position in the ideas of any nation. Historical students had for a long time entertained very diverse opinions concerning the origin of Budhism. Some had thought that, excepting Brahmanism, it was the most ancient of eastern religions. Others had supposed that it"], [326, "246 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT Avas the primitive faith of Hindustan, which has been driven forth \u2014 on the south to Ceylon, and thence spread towards the east and Farther India, and on the north to Tibet, Tartary, Mongolia, China, Corea, and Japan \u2014 and superseded by other religions ; and the fact that scarcely an individual of that belief can be found in India to-day, with the knoAvledge of the modern sway of Mohammedanism and Brahmanism there, would perhaps not detract from, if it did not strengthen, such a notion. Pococke, the author of ' India in Greece,' imagined that the early Greeks were Budhists. Some had thought that Budhism was eliminated from the gross pantheisms of Egypt and Greece, and a few had even essayed to identify Budha with the Hermes of the ancient Egyptians. The Jesuits would persuade us that Budhism is of Nestorian origin Traces of this ancient faith have been found in Swedish Lapland, and endeavours have been made to prove Budha one and the same with the Woden of the Scandinavians. But notwithstanding all these conjectures and speculations, Budhism is now generally believed by oriental scholars to have originated in the sixth century B.C. \u2014 to have sprung up in Nepaul, a country lying contiguous to India on the north ; and 8 in fixing this date no further reliance is placed on"], [327, "247 RUINS OF ANGKOR\u2014 THE CITY AND ENVIRONS the canonical books of Budhism than seems to be Avarranted by evidence derived from other sources, for a Hindoo has no idea of real history.' It is true that the prachadis, or sacred spires, of the Siamese slightly resemble in form \u2014 but more in purpose, for their ' original design was sepulchral ' \u2014 the Pyramids, but there are no prachadis among the ruins of Angkor. The physiognomy of the Siamese and Cambodian Budhas compares better, that is more correctly and fully, with that of several tribes even now inhabiting the plateaus of Central Asia \u2014 beyond the northern base of the Himalayas \u2014 than any race yet discovered in Ethiopia. And the notion that the chambers of the Egyptian Pyramids were intended to contain relics of sacred animals, which were worshipped, has been exhaustively discussed and amply refuted by the greater number of learned Egyptologists. The Siamese word Phra, prefixed to the titles of their kings, means ' lord ' or ' master ; ' it will hardly bear the rendering Pharaoh. And the fact that 'the Egyptians were red-skinned, and the Siamese are a mixture of black, yellow, and Avhite, and there are no vestiges of a red race among them,' seems to indicate that the length of time which has elapsed since the red men were there (Siam) has been so enormous that"], [328, "248 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT none of the ruins, if the hypothesis of the Egyptians or a people identical with them (can the writer refer to the JeAvs?) holding sway over a portion of Indo- China were tenable, could now be standing in such tolerable condition. Budhism has more striking points of resemblance to Christianity than to any religion of Egypt. An eminent Budhist reformer of the fourteenth century once defined the duty of the different classes of Budhists in the following manner .* \u2014 ' Men of the lowest order of mind must believe that there is a God ; and that there is a future life, in Avhich they will receive the reward or punishment of their actions and conduct in this life. ' Men of the middle degree of mental capacity must add to the above the knowledge that all things in this world are perishable ; that imperfection is a pain and degradation ; and that deliverance from existence is a deliverance from pain, and consequently a final beatitude. ' Men of the third or highest order must believe, in further addition, that nothing exists, or will continue always, or cease absolutely, except through dependence on a casual connection or concatenation. So will they arrive at the true knowledge of God.'"], [329, "249 RUINS OF ANGKOR\u2014 THE CITY AND ENVIRONS ' What is this,' justly asks Princep (' Tibet, Tartary, and Mongolia '), the distinguished Asiatic antiquarian and orientalist, avIio first deciphered the ancient Pali (obtaining his clue to the characters of that language from inscriptions engraved on a stone tablet, noAv preserved in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta), * Avhat is this but Christianity, wanting only tlie name of Christ as its preacher and the Mosaic faith for its antecedent?

There seems to be much stronger reason for imputing the founding of Angkor to the Jews than the Egyptians, and more still to some tribe which has migrated from Central Asia at a remote period than to either of these races.

There are a few minor detached ruins scattered through the forest, and many heaps of bricks, of Avhich latter the city proper seems to have been built.

From the staircase the sandstone"], [330, "250 THE LAND OF THE WIHTE ELEPILVNT facing has fallen away, and the underlying coarse vol canic rock is much worn ; the steps were so narrow Ave could scarcely obtain a sufficiently secure footing to ascend to the top. In a small room near the summit were long inscriptions engraved upon the jambs of the doors in the ancient (undecipherable) Cambodian character. Near the palace there lives a petty provincial officer who has had charge of the ruins, he told us, for over thirty years. His reception room was quite an armoury : in it were several flint-lock muskets ; two or three fowling-pieces ; some large swords, resembling the terrible Japanese weapons; half a dozen powder horns, from which the poAvder Avas emptied at the large end; some wickerwork shot-baskets, gun wad cases, &c. The officer presented us Avith pumelows and bananas, and we had a long conversa tion concerning the ruins, but, excepting the dimensions of the Avails, the old man could give but little informa tion. About half a mile north-west of Nagkon Wat there are the ruins of an observatory, built upon the summit of a hill perhaps 500 feet in height. A foot path leads up this hill through the thick jungle. The first indication of any antiquities thereabouts is two immense stone griffins, one standing on each side of"], [331, "RUINS OF ANGKOR\u2014 THE CITY AND ENVIRONS 25 i the path ; and next we pass a small image with the head of an elephant and the body of a human being ; it is the elephant-headed Ganesh \u2014 the god of wisdom of the Hindoo mythology. Arriving at a small level space, there appeared a ' foot-print ' of Budha (of modern make), looking like a gigantic bath-tub sunk in the ground. Two large stone towers stood near the ' foot print,' whose roofs on the interior sloped gradually, with four carved sides, to an apex. The architecture Avas very beautiful and quite unique in style. One of these towers we found filled with stone and Avood sitting images ; the other contained a colossal stone king or divinity of some sort, whose head, hands, and arms had been broken from the trunk. It lay upon its back on the floor, and was evidently of ancient make. Its toes being of the natural lengths, we knew it could not be a Budha (in the latter the toes and fingers are of the same length); besides, the head had four faces, and there Avere four pairs of arms and hands.

From the summit we obtained an extensive view of the sur- rounding country, which Avas level and for the most part covered with riant jungle, there being a great number of oil trees. To the north there extended from east to west a range of Ioav blue hills ; to the south east we could j ust discern the placid waters of Lake Thalaysap ; to the south lay the quaint old town of Siamrap ; and to the south-west there was another large lake of bright, clear water. We returned to our sala, took a parting look at Nagkon Wat, tiffined, and left for Siamrap. In the evening we paid a farewell visit to the Governor, who received us at the head of the stairs, and escorted us to chairs in the reception hall. His Excellency told Nak Prat that the party of Chinese merchants would start on the day but one foUowing ; that he would give him a free passage to Panompin, and order everything necessary to be provided for his comfort.

'Deng,' the cook, had made five or six loaves of bread, some dried apple-pies, and had boiled one-half of a ham, whilst the Governor offered to supply rice, fowls, eggs, fish, fruit. In the forenoon came my new servant a wild-looking Cochin Chinese boy, Avith his black hair combed straight back from the forehead and tied in a knot behind the head, and his large mouth stained red and his teeth blackened by constant rumination of the betel cud.

This I"], [336, "256 THE LAND OF THE AA1IITE ELEPHANT accepted, and had a very amusing time, OAving to the fact that there was no conversation between us, though there Avas plenty of pantomime (the interpreters had returned Avith my companions to Bangkok). Having been escorted to a house Avithout the walls, I was received by His Excellency in a very small room, the floor of which was covered with bamboo mats and whose Avails were hung with grotesque Siamese paintings. After blankly staring at each other for some time, and making several futile attempts to express our thoughts by vigorous move ments of eyes, arms, and legs \u2014 at which we both laughed heartily \u2014 the Governor took my hand in his own, and thus Ave Avalked, at the head of a large crowd of attendants and nobles, out of the compound, and through the gate of the walled town on to the recep tion hall of the palace.

The Governor was much pleased with my book of sketches, and"], [337, "257 SIAMRAP TO PANOMPIN recognised many which had been taken in his province and in Siamrap town. But our conversation (?) was so fatiguing that the visit was not prolonged to a \\*ery late hour. A present of two dozen eggs, six or eight cakes of sugar, half a bushel of rice, a dozen foAvls, and about two hundred bananas was sent after me to the sala. On the following morning, the 18th of February, with a buffalo cart for my baggage, provisions, and servant, and a bullock cart for myself, Ave left Siamrap for Lake Thalaysap and Panompin. The suburbs of the town extend a long Avay to the southward ; these traversed, we entered upon an immense level plain covered Avith young paddy of a beautiful green colour and some six inches in height ; Avater, for irrigation, being con ducted over it in little canals, though this is unneces sary during a considerable part of the year, when the lake overflows this section of country. Two or three miles from Siamrap, Avest of the road, Avere the ruins of a lofty stone tower, not as grand or beautiful as those of Nagkon Wat. Opposite a low sandhill we came suddenly upon the river, where was a camp of natives and a large corral of buffaloes and bullocks. There were two boats in the river, filled with provisions and cooking utensils, which the men were towing as they walked in the stream ; farther down were some more s"], [338, "258 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT boats propelled in the same manner. We next crossed a boggy marsh, and passing through about a mile of thick shrubbery, over a road much cut up by elephant tracks, we halted at the present terminus of the road, for the swamp prevented farther progress by land ; and after patiently \u2014 or rather impatiently \u2014 waiting for nearly two hours, my Cochin Chinese boy succeeded in procuring a canoe, in which we, Avith bag and bag gage, paddled a mile or so to the place where the lake boats were moored. There appeared to be no village thereabouts, only a little hut where some Chinamen were repairing or building boats. In the water, slioored to each other and to the shore, were about twenty boats of different sizes, built somewhat after the Chinese junk pattern, with huge eyes painted upon either side of their prows ; their occupants seemed to be Cambodians chiefly, though there were also many Chinamen. The craft to which I was allotted was about sixty feet in length, ten in width, and four above the water-line, Avith a house, the sides of plank running fore and aft (ex cept a small platform in the stern, for the steersman), raised about three or perhaps four feet at the ridge pole. It Avas built of hard Avood, gummed (pitched) on the inner side bekvvv the Avater-line, had two decks, a"], [339, "259 SIAMRAP TO PANOMPIN room with two small windows, about the centre of the boat upon the upper deck, being reserved for my own accommodation ; and adjoining it toAvards the stern there was a room to be used by the boy as a sleeping apartment and by myself as a kitchen and storeroom for the provisions. The roof, made of palm-leaf and covered with stout pieces of bamboo, was so low one could only crawl about in the cabin below, where in the middle of the day the heat was almost unbear able. The crew consisted of three Chinese \u2014 two of Avhom were also merchants and owners of the boat \u2014 and two Cambodians, and the remaining Chinaman was simply a passenger like myself; we carried no freight. At a bend in the river, a short distance below our moorings, were more huts and boat-builders. The people on the banks seemed to live by supplying the boatmen with fish and other food. The river was not more than thirty or forty feet wide ; its banks were hned Avith stunted, scrubby trees and bushes, Avhich bore a water-mark four feet above the then level of the stream. After an hour of vigorous use of the pole we came suddenly into the lake, two sides of which (the southern and western) were bounded by the horizon ; the water was muddy and a heavy ground swell was rolling. After we had all had supper, four oars were \u2022s 2"], [340, "260 THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT rigged forward near the bows (nearly all easterns place their oars for rowing near the bow), the captain worked with another, holding the tiller with his feet, and then we rowed along the eastern shore until after midnight, when the men moored the boat with grass ropes to a large mangrove tree. In the morning, going on deck, I found, by my compass, Ave were rowing up a narrow river to the northward, and soon after we arrived at a large village \u2014 of a hundred huts \u2014 where the men signified Ave were to remain a single night, to receive on board a supply of rice for the voyage. After breakfast I took a long walk on shore. The village \u2014 styled upon the map Ca.mpong Pluk \u2014 is situated upon an immense sandbank by a little river which here empties itself into the lake. The miserable huts are built upon piles eight or ten feet in height, for even the sandbank is submerged with Avater during a third of the year. The people, mostly Cambodians, though there were some Chinese, are all boat-builders. There were fifty or more boats, in different stages of construction, lying upon rollers upon the bank. Native tools, though of rude make, still are the same in form and purpose as those used by Europeans ; easily recognisable were the adzes, axes, planes, saws, and chisels. These people"], [341, "261 SLVMRAP TO PANOMPIN are not very luxurious feeders, a little fish and rice supplying their every need. As I walked through the boulevard of the village some Avomen were weaving with primitive looms the coarse cloth from which their sole and ' confidential ' garment is made ; in a small temple was an ancient stone image with four arms ; near it was a boat, over a hundred feet in length, cut from a single tree. The A'illagers were most curious ; Avherever the farang stopped a great crowd collected at once around him, and quite a large pro cession folloAved him during his entire walk : many natives, doubtless, had never before looked upon a ' pale-face.' The crew of my boat had been on shore all day preparing for the voyage, and in the evening came to ask that they might remain another day, in in order to pound their paddy (i.e. remove the husks); this was refused, for ample time had been alloAved them ; and, besides, the Governor of Siamrap had assured the farang he Avould not be detained any where. At Campong Pluk another Chinaman joined us as a passenger. When we reached the lake, the wind being against us, the boat Avas speedily lashed to a tree. I suggested the propriety of tacking, as the Avind Avas not Avhat sailors term ' dead ahead,' but the only satis-"], [342, "262 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT faction received Avas the reply that the boat would upset, and, upon second thought, I believed the old lumber-raft would do so, for its bottom was quite round and had no keel, and the ' house ' made it very topheavy, especially as there was no cargo. In the evening the mast and sail Avere prepared for the expected fair land breeze. The mast Avas about twelve feet above the roof of the cabin ; the sail Avas lateen-shaped and made of mats. The land breeze sprang up about nine and continued all night, we making from two to three miles an hour. The great lake of Cambodia styled Thalaysap \u2014 the Sweet Water Lake \u2014 is intersected about the centre of its northern half by the 13\u00b0 of lat. N. and 104\u00b0 of long.

Its dimensions are ninety miles in length, twenty- two in width at the Avidest part, and eight in the narrowest ; its depth is not uniform ; six feet would perhaps represent the average, although in some places, as in the middle, no bottom has been found. In the rainy season its length is increased to upwards of 120 miles. The colour of the water is a dirty yellow, produced by so many small streams emptying themselves into it. Current there is but little in the most southerly parts, Avhere it discharges its waters into the Mesap river. In the rainy season terrible"], [343, "263 SIAMRAP TO PANOMPIN storms are sometimes experienced, but during the re mainder of the year there is usually an immense fleet of fishing smacks, which cruise about the lake.

The northern half of the lake is owned by Siam ; the southern belongs to Cambodia, which kingdom formerly possessed the greater part of the surrounding region. It Avas in the year 1795 that the then ruling king of Siam took pos session of the provinces of Battambong and Siamrap, as a reparation for some services he had rendered the prince of Cambodia \u2014 protecting him from his revolted subjects and causing him to be croAvned at Oodong, the old capital.

A little of the AVestern shore, or rather side, of the lake Avas visible, though there was no land to be seen \u2014 nothing but reeds and low,, scrubby trees.

Boat life in Cambodia is rather monotonous where one has no compagnon de voyage, and cannot speak the language of the people, and there is no other language understood in common. There is no place to walk ; there is no awning or shelter so that one might sit upon deck, and the only recourse left is to lie in bed and read, or sit bent double \u2014 for the deck (the roof of the cabin) will not admit an erect sitting posture \u2014 and Avrite. However, with reading, and writing, and mapping (at present there are no corect maps of that little-known quarter of the globe in existence, and on the best map procurable I found some of the towns placed as much as thirty miles out of position, and rivers whose entire course varied from three to twelve miles from their real place), completing my rough sketches, writing letters, and cooking \u2014 I became quite an expert after a week's practice of the latter \u2014 I contrived to instruct and amuse myself, and pass during the day the slow revolving hours away.

One day avc saAv some natives hauling a net about five hundred feet in length ; the inside of the net was perfectly alive with fish of every size, some of them being large. Many towns seemed devoted exclusively to the fish business \u2014 drying and salting fish, and manufacturing fish-oil. Some of the fish caught in this river are eight or ten feet in length and three feet in thickness. Immense quantities of fish are caught in Lake Thalaysap and the Mesap and Makong rivers, and being smoked and salted are ex ported to almost every country of Asia. From the heads of the largest variety fish-oil is made, and from their bodies the condiment so highly prized by the Siamese, and styled by them namphrik. Tliese fishing towns occur every four or six miles, and seem to consist of but a single row of huts, facing the river. The first wat seen in Cambodia resembled those of Siam ; there Avas a large image-house and a pyra midal tower or spire.

The Avater in the river Avas very Ioav at the time of my visit, and thus the city seemed built upon a bluff fully thirty feet in height ; there Avere no floating houses to be seen, and not a great number of boats, most of which were owned and manned by Chinese. Part of Panompin, to the south, is built upon an island, and nearly opposite this the river Avhich drains Lake Thalaysap \u2014 the Mesap \u2014 enters the great Makong, one of the largest rivers of the world, which rises near the confines of Tibet, and, after a"], [350, "270 THE LAND OF THE AVHITE ELEPHANT course of 1,700 miles, empties itself into the sea at the southern extremity of Cochin China, and Avhich at a distance of over 200 miles from its mouth is three miles in width.

As we sailed sloAvly down the riATer, the first objects that attracted my attention were the small but neat buildings \u2014 chapel and schools \u2014 of the Eoman Catholic mission. Next we passed an old dilapidated steam boat, and back of this, on the shore, waved the national Cambodian flag \u2014 blue with a red border, and emblems of peace and plenty in the centre ground. Then came the barracks, where are stationed a com pany of French troops, and the residence of the Com mandant, or Protecteur, as he is styled, who represents French interests versus His Majesty's. Anchored in the stream, opposite the Commandant's residence, was a small gunboat, with a huge tricolour floating from the stern, another from the jibboom end, and still another from the captain's gig ; there could surely be no mistake about the nationality of this craft. Farther down the river could be seen a brig, a war steamer, and a small despatch boat ; tliese were anchored abreast of the palace and belonged to the King."], [351, "271 PANOMPIN Landing near the barracks, I Avent thither in search of an interpreter \u2014 some one who could perchance speak English. My meagre diction Avas fortunately understood, and a Cochin Chinese boy was sent with me to a store near at hand, where a native of the Isle of Jersey, named Edwards, received me kindly ; offered to ' put me up ' and to render me besides any assistance in his power.

In the after noon a friend staying with Edwards kindly offered to procure for me an interpreter and to guide me to the Prime Minister's residence. At two o'clock we started forth, taking the main street, south, towards the palace. The city extends along the bank of the river for a distance of about three miles, and perhaps not more than half a mile at the farthest into the interior ; on that side there is a low embankment of earth, erected recently \u2014 at the time of the Annamite trouble. There is no wall about Panompin, not even around the palace. The main road runs north and south along the river ; there are a few cross-roads, but this is the street. It is about thirty feet wide, macadamised with broken brick and sand, and lined throughout its entire length with little bamboo shops, the greater part owned by Chinese, many by Klings, and the remainder by Cambodians and Cochin Chinese. Many of these shops are 'gambling hells;' some are used by opium-smokers ; the Klings offer for sale miscellaneous European goods, and the Cambodians silks and cottons : the Cambodians are celebrated for"], [353, "273 PANOMPIN their manufacture of silk. The population of Panompin is about 20,000, and embraces Chinese, Cochin Chinese, Klings, and Siamese, besides Cambodians. As we walked along, the street was crowded with natives. The Cochin Chinese were easily distinguishable from the Cambodians by their height, which is less than that of the latter ; their frame, Avhich is usually not so muscular ; by their features, Avhich incline more to the Mongolian cast ; and their manner of wearing the hair long and fastened in a knot or twist behind. The Cochin Chinese Avornen were clothed in gowns Avhich descended to the knees, and they seemed to be much better-looking than Siamese women. We called first upon the favourite interpreter of the King \u2014 a native of Manilla, named Miriano, who spoke English very well \u2014 to engage his services in the expected interview with His Majesty. We next visited the chief aide-de-camp ofthe King \u2014 an English Jew \u2014 and found him busy trying on a new military uniform \u2014 coA'ered with an enormous amount of gold lace, and with a pair of gilt epaulets fit for a field marshal \u2014 which he had had made in Hong Kong, to be worn during the approaching fete.

Eeturning to Miriano's house, my friend left me, and then the interpreter and myself proceeded to the palace.

My present to the King Avas a fine gold-mounted revolver, in a case Avith proper appurtenances, and a large brass box of cartridges. In return His Majesty said that if there was anything in the palace or city Avhich I wished, it was only necessary to acquaint him with the fact to possess it ; this was rather obscure and equivocal, so I merely bowed in reply. He desired me to come and see him whenever convenient, at least twice before leaving, if I did not determine to remain for the fete, and in the meantime he Avould think of some gift for me as a keepsake from himself. Seeing me peering rather curiously into some of the adjoining rooms, the King asked if I would not like to look through the palace ; the foreigner Avas only too happy, and His Majesty graciously led the way into the parlour.

On the walls were large steel engravings of ' Napoleon III. at Solferino,' and ' Prince Malakoff at Sebastopol.' Upon one of the tables was a music-box, about four feet long by two in width \u2014 a magnificent instrument, manufactured in Paris. His Majesty having obtained the key, wound it up for our amusement. It played eight selections from popular Italian operas in a sort of orchestral style \u2014 there Avere flutes, drums, cymbals, and bells.

It was a perfect marvel of mechanical skill, and would bear the closest inspection. This bird was covered with fine feathers of natural hue, and no joints could be detected even when it turned its head. Thinking it might prove an interesting novelty, I showed the King the calendar \u2014 dials of the days of the week and of the month \u2014 upon my watch ; but he had one of that kind, he said, and having fetched it, strange to say, the watch was made by the same firm in Geneva as my own.

The King's watch told also the month and the stages of the moon \u2014 new, full, aud the quarters\u2014 and Avas besides a repeater. The cases were most elegantly jewelled ; upon the front was a row of large pearls round the rim, and Avithin this circle Avas the crown, composed of rubies, sapphires, topazes, and emeralds, and below the royal cypher N. in diamonds of different sizes ; a large diamond was set in the extremity of the ' stem-winder ; ' the reverse had also a circle of pearls, and within it the coat of arms or seal of His Majesty most elabo rately carved and engraved \u2014 in Ioav relief \u2014 and in Etruscan gold.

In one corner was a glass case, containing a small collection of books upon general literature in the French language, uniformly bound in red morocco, with the King's arms stamped upon their covers. In another corner was a large geographical globe and some portfohos of maps and charts, and in another a black walnut writing-desk, with proper materiel. A magnificent bronze clock adorned the mantelpiece, and upon the centre table, besides large piles of books and a student's lamp, were two marble statuettes \u2014 busts, the one of (wonders wiU never cease) Goethe and the other of Schiller. The King seemed to take much pride in calhng attention to various articles in this room, though he probably understood their uses or applications less than the contents of any other room of the palace.

The two remaining apartments were used as bedchambers : that of the King was rather plain in its furnishing ; the bedstead Avas of black walnut, similar to our own ; the pillows only were different, being little, hard, square bags, Avith gold-embroidered ends. The King pre sented me Avith a small lace bag, which contained, he said, a dozen different kinds of flowers, and with similar ones his bed was always perfumed, after the Cam bodian fashion. The toilet service was of gold ; the floor was covered with matting, and a few engravings hung upon the Avails. The other bedroom was similar in contents, except that some of the pictures were rather plain-spoken ; the toilet service of this chamber was silver, manufactured in European style.

The strong contrast betAveen the bamboo huts of the city and the grandeur of the palace is painfully appa rent, and for the expenses of beautifying the latter His Majesty is said to appropriate private property without indemnification. Still the King deserves great credit for his remarkable energy, his adoption of European ideas and notions ; notwithstanding he is said to despise his subjects noAv he no longer fears them, to mock at Budha when he is in the mood, and to tread under foot the ancient etiquette. Norodom has reigned now for about eleven years, and his rule has been in the main just ; he is much liked by the people generally, which, perhaps, is as great praise as any ruler could wish or could obtain.

The pagoda and the great mound were built of dimi nutive bricks ; from the summit of the latter an excellent view of that part of the river upon the opposite bank, including the custom house and the great Makong river, may be had.

Tliese buildings, built of brick, with tiled roofs and gaily ornamented in the Siamese style, are quite imposing.

There exists what is called ' a board of judges,' but no case of importance can be tried without the presence of the King, from whose decision there is no appeal.

The French have a fort or citadel here, with war stores, about 200 soldiers, and a functionary styled ' District Inspector.' The fort is a simple earth work, palisaded exteriorly with bamboo, and sur rounded by a broad moat filled with water ; no guns are mounted, and the Avhole is in very bad order, being overgrown with trees and grass, the barracks and buildings also within are much dilapidated.

There are in Saigon very many hotels, or more properly speaking cafes, at which the most of the French residents appear to hve. These cafes are not scrupulously clean ; still one may obtain a modest room and fair meals at reasonable charges.

Public affairs are administered by a Governor ap pointed by the Emperor and sent out from France, and assisted by a Legislative and Executive Council. The streets of Saigon are broad, and macadamised Avith brick (Avhich makes a very disagreeable dust) ; in t\\ATo of them, which run at right angles to the river, are stone canals for the more convenient loading and unloading of the small cargo boats of the country.

In Saigon there are many schools for teaching Annamites the French language and the general rudi ments of education ; the children of Europeans are usually sent home to attend school. The army and navy at the disposal of the Governor-General is small, but sufficient to preserve order throughout the French provinces in Cochin China.

'France in the east' is, as far as my limited observa tion goes, a great farce \u2014 a travesty, a burlesque upon colonisation in general. The French character is sadly Avanting in many of the virtues necessary for successful pioneering in foreign lands ; it lacks that sturdy, energetic, persevering trait which we see so ably displayed by the English in India and Australia and by the German settlers in America. It must be that politics alone have to do with the retaining by France at the present day of so minute and oddly situated a province as Pondicherry, or such a country as Cochin China, inhabited by so warlike and rebellious a people.

And a late Avriter in the London ' Daily Telegraph ' thus sums up the results of the expedition up the great Makong river : \u2014 'M.

This hope has failed ; the Makong, Avhich the Frenchman traced at the cost of terrible hard ships and great sacrifice of brave and valuable life, is an ' impassable river,' broken at least thrice by furious cataracts and having a current against Avhich nothing could be navigated.

In connection Avith a ' back way ' route to China, it may be mentioned that the members of the French commission found the Songkoi \u2014 a fine river nearly two hundred miles in length, which Aoavs into the Gulf of Tonquin by tAvo mouths\u2014 perfectly navigable, and ' in every Avay fitted to promote the commercial intercourse of the Celestial Empire with our neAv colony.'

The country on either side is low, level, and thinly peopled ; the banks are lined with mangroves down to the very water's edge. At the mouth of the river, upon a Ioav hill, is a lighthouse Avith a powerful light, and in a sheltered position behind this hill there is a small fishing village where the pilots and their famihes reside. We steamed gaily down the tortuous river and out to sea, where we met a favourable breeze from the nortliAvard ; all Avas prosperous and hopeful, but as I slowly paced the deck on that beautiful star-lit night of the 4th of March, 1872, I could not but feel sad at the thought of leaving the marvellously beautiful countries and the strange people and stranger customs of Farther India, probably for many years, possibly for ever.
