CHAPTER I. IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. has been intimated that Muriel's home 's^* coming had not been the unmixed joy she had anticipated. The severe discipline and hardships of her school-life had been shared Avith others. In the school there Avas no favouritism, and if she suffered more it Avas from her greater sensibility and long isolation from her kith and kin. Returning, she had found that long absence had apparently Aveakened the bonds of sisterhood, that the accomplishments she had acquired so pain fully served only to mark her out for envy, and that she was no nearer to the heart of her father. Well Avas it that hers Avas not a VOL. n. B"], [14, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 2 rebellious disposition. She had learned self repression almost from her cradle, so early Avas the ban of ugliness set upon her, and the doctrine, that \" only goodness could atone for her want of good looks,\" inculcated. Pather, aunts, uncles, all harped on the same string, the latter adding jests and banter to their admonitions. Only her mother refrained, and to that mother she clung as to a superior being, Avhose amiability she could never hope to equal. And there she might be right, for Mrs. D'Anyer's amiability Avas not that of inane Aveakness, but of a self-subdued will, and hourly self-sacrifice for the preservation of domestic peace. There was some com pensation for Muriel in the regard of her aged grandparents, the D'Anyers, and in the clinging affection of little Sara, and even in the satisfaction with Avhich Lydia hailed her coming whenever baby Lyd Avas tedious, because she \" had such a Avinning way with the child,\" or in Milly Hargreaves' many sentimental confidences. And it so happened"], [15, "IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. 3 that handsome, spoiled, Avayward Milly, having no sisters of her own, had singled out Muriel in their earliest childhood as the one cousin to supply the want, and to be loved and trusted aboA-e the rest. Certainly, whenever Muriel stayed Avith her Grandmother Bancroft there Avas Millicent to be found also ;\u2014play mates in infancy, companions as girlhood grew and ripened. Muriel was often at her Uncle Sam's. Not that Lydia Avas particularly sociable, but she fancied her aunt Avas isolated and desponding, and that the baby Avanted better nursing and more fresh air. So with Sara by her side, she Avould take the long-robed infant in her arms and stroll up Red Bank, or to the Horrocks in quest of Milly, bringing Sara back with a store of summer posies gathered by the Avay. Of course, this soon came to John D'Anyer's ears. His pride took fire. He was \" indignant that his daughter, avIio had not been suffered to nurse her oavu brother, should have no more pride or self respect than to turn b 2"], [16, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 4 amateur nursernaid to anybody's child, least of all that of his brother-in-law's countrified wife ! \" And in his indignation, he stigmatised his wife and daughter, both to his informant and to their faces, as \" spiritless lackeys,\" a term of opprobrium by no means neAV, but this time it travelled farther than he in tended. Mrs. Bancroft came in one afternoon with her tucked-up gOAvn and black mode scarf, and a set purpose in every line of her face. She met Muriel in the passage. \" Well, child, I hear that roses don't groAv Avithout thorns in these parts,\" she said meaningly. \" Nor in any parts, grandmother ; but Miss Williams taught me Iioav to blunt their points.\" Into the sitting-room she marched. \"So, Ellen, I hear that you and Muriel are a pair of ' spiritless lackeys.' But I'll see that Muriel plays lackey no more, either for him or Lydia, or those lazybone sisters of hers. She goes back to Chester at the fair.\""], [17, "IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. 5 \" Goes back there ! \" and timid Mrs. D'Anyer looked appalled. \" Yes, Mrs. Hopley offered to take her as an apprentice. I didn't see it then, but I do now. Trade's bad, very bad, likely to be Avorse ; food's rising in price. Ah, you may Avell sigh, Avith so many mouths to feed, and John making bad debts. It may be a good thing if one of the girls gets a trade in her fingers. Not that Muriel Avill ever need it. I'll see to that ; but it may be useful and saving amongst a family of girls.\" \"And what shall / do?\" asked Ellen. ruefully, she had found in Muriel a companion as Avell as a helper, such as the younger ones could neA'er be. \"Do ! Why, set that lazy Marion and Anna to work. They'll shed no tears for their sister if they do for their 'lackey.'' The Avord must have galled Sarah Bancroft, she made so much of it. \"But, mother, Anna and Marion still go to school, they have their lessons to learn at home, they cannot help me ; besides,"], [18, "6 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. Muriel is older\u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 more thought ful.\" \" Aye, much too thoughtful to my mind, it seems as if she had the cares of the whole family on her young shoulders. And she's for helping Lydia with her's into the bargain ; and small thanks she gets. But I'll put a stop to it.\" \" And Avhat about Sara ? Muriel is teaching her. The child Avould miss her dreadfully.\" \" Teaching is she, and Avashing, and dress ing, and amusing, I suppose. Well, she shall go Avhere she will be learning instead of teaching. Send Sara to school and keep Anna at home if you Avant a helper beside the maids. Muriel plays general ' lackey ' no longer here ! \" And though Ellen D'Anyer sighed, and John D'Anyer's pride rebelled, Mrs. Ban -croft's strong Avill and plain speaking carried the day. Muriel Avas but a leaf on the stream. Her opinion was not asked, her Avishes were ,not consulted, her objections Avere over-ruled. Indeed she ceased to object Avhen her mother"], [19, "IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. 7 said, \" Don't tliAvart your grandmother, she sees farther than Ave do, and it Avon't do to offend her. Your father looks to her for means to help him OA'er the present crisis ; for betAveen your uncles and aunts there is nothing to be got out of the D'Anyers. There are too many schemers around the old folk. So be a good lass and go quietly.\" \" Ah ! mother dear, that is always your maxim \u2014 ' quietly.' It is not ahvays easy to be quiet. But kiss me, mother, and I'll do my best to be quiet too.\" And she kept her word, not for a day, but for a life. When Sarah Bancroft, and John D'Anyer and Sam rode back from Chester Autumn Eair, Muriel Avas left behind, bound hard and fast by her indentures to Mrs. Hopley for the term of five 3rears ; the remission of tAvo years from the customary seven haA'ing been made a matter of extra premium. Mrs. Bancroft had gone in search of the Rev. Thomas Bancroft once more, hoping this time to induce a little better supervision of the girl ;"], [20, "8 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. and was disappointed to find that he had quitted Chester for a better living in Bolton, nevertheless, she left her in her old friend's charge with not a doubt of Mrs. Hopley's motherly care, and kissed the girl on leaving with the fullest sense of having done her duty, and her best for Muriel. Hoav far her judg ment Avas right remains to be seen. And let no one in these times be surprised that the child and grandchild of well-to-do manufacturers should be so apprenticed. There Avas no such gulf betAAreen the retail and the Avholesale trader as society now sets up. Men (and ay omen) of Avealth, worked with their own hands amongst their oavii work people and thought it only right to do so. There was no chance, no excuse for the men idling when the master was at work too ; and when hands, and eyes, and brains, and capital worked together, fortunes were made. John D'Anyer Avas wont to boast that he had patrician blood in his veins, and it Avas the pride of ancestry, not of the manufacturer, Avhich rebelled against his mother-in-law's"], [21, "IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. 9 proposition. But Chester was far aAvay, Muriel might come back improved in appear ance, or at all events more useful to those at home ; he had his oavii reasons for keeping terms Avith his decisive mother-in-law, and after some demur he assented. It Avas customary at that time to keep the raAV apprentice for a Avhole year running up the seams of gown-skirts, and running errands. It Avas not until the last year of her probation that she Avas alloAved to cut out and trim. But Mrs. Hopley had other views with respect to Miss D'Anyer ; views she had not thought necessary to set before Mrs. Bancroft. When she Avas gone and all settled, Muriel Avas shoAvn into an upstairs room, or rather garret, with AvhiteAvashed Avails, Avhere she and three other apprentices had to sleep. It contained tAvo truckle beds, a small trian gular Avashstand, and a tiny looking-glass suspended from a nail in the AvindoAv frame.

There was no Avardrobe, no chest of drawers. Muriel's trunk Avas tightly packed. \"Where can I put my clothes ? \" she asked. Miss Holmes pointed to a row of pegs in use. \" You can have a couple of those, there is your trunk for the rest ; and IavouH advise you to lock it.\" Muriel looked dismayed. \" Why, this is Avorse than Miss Briscoe's.\" Miss Holmes smiled. \" Children are apt to be inquisitive, aud to leaA-e dirty finger marks, that is all I meant.

Six or seven young persons were seated round it at Avork, and Avithout looking up or pausing for an instant, eyed her askance as she entered. \" Miss D'Anyer, you can take that seat,\" said Mrs. Hopley, a plain little woman, in as plain a black gOAvn, at the top of the table, pointing to an unoccupied rush-bottomed chair Avith a straight high back. \" There is a green camlet petticoat on which you can begin, for practice. Miss Holmes, I will thank you to show Miss D'Anyer how I require the straight seams to be run together. She must not attempt the gores.\" The camlet Avas hard and stiff, the needle long, the work neAV ; she pricked her fingers,"], [24, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 12 knotted her thread ; at the end of the seam found the upper breadth two inches short. It was evidently puckered. She had to draw out the thread, and commence afresh. She managed better the next time. But she had fastened off her threads, had sAverved from the straight line. Again the thread had to be withdrawn. The task she had thought so simple did require practice. The third time she was more successful. So began Muriel's initiation into the art of mantua-making. So began her five years bond-service. Is there nothing to be learned in those five years of maidenhood but the mysteries of thread and needle, silk and scissors ? Will no romance break in on the dull monotony of five years' stitchery ? Wait. Time does not open his budget beforehand.

Three months later Mrs. Hopley found it convenient to call in one of her own young sters to pick up the pins, and to send another apprentice on the outdoor errands, which had preATiously been so beneficial to Muriel's health. It Avas only on the Sunday that she could breathe the fresh air, and then after church she Avould take one or other of the little Hopleys by the hand, for a stroll by the Dee, or across the river to Handbridge, some times in company with Lucinda Holmes, but she \" did not care to have the children al ways at her heels ; little pitchers had such long ears, and such long tongues into the bargain.\" \" Ah, but they have affectionate little hearts,\" replied Muriel, \" and if our own tongues do not Avag too fast, Ave need not"], [27, "IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. 15 be afraid of theirs, so mother used to tell Betty.\" Nevertheless Miss Holmes preferred to take the air without the said \" little pitchers.\" Mrs. Hopley had found more profitable employment for Muriel \u2014 profitable, that is, for herself \u2014 which began with floAvering (as it was called) a Avhite satin waistcoat for Lord Grosvenor, Avith coloured silk, in what is noAv designated crewel stitch. Shortly before Muriel was placed with the Misses Briscoe, British muslin had been first manufactured.

Through this the skilful Avorker sent her rapid little tambour needle (or hook) darting with the celerity of light, caught up the fine crewel Avorsted, and so conjured a wreath of glowing roses into being under her deft hand. It was not a healthy occupation for a growing girl; there Avas no mention of it in her indentures \u2014 it formed no legitimate part of the business she was there to learn ; yet there she was seated from six in the morning until dusk, with her back to her companions, and the breadth of the frame interposed betAveen her and a glimpse of the traffic in the street far beloAv.

Lucinda had been to the theatre with her father once or twice, and had visited the shows on the Justing-field at Fair times with the other girls, and had witnessed the performance of a party of strolling players in a barn before she left North wich. Muriel had only the remembrance of a pantomime seen in her childhood, but she had heard her father and relations talk of tragedies and comedies, and had early made acquaintance with Shakespeare in Theobalds edition from her father's bookshelves, until she had a strong desire to see an acted play. But there had also been the counter influence of her three years with the Misses Briscoe, to whom a theatre was but a single remove from the bottomless pit, the Chester play-house essentially so. Mrs. Hopley too had strong views on the subject. Muriel's quick \" Oh, thank you ! \" was followed by, \" Do you think it would be right for us to go, sir? Mrs. Hopley \" \" Bother Mrs. Hopley !

The history of the Chester Theatre had something to do with this, for though Muriel was not puritanic she had the fullest reverence for sacred things. It so happened that its site was not propitious. The ancient church of St. Nicholas had at one time been transferred to St. Oswald, but either the saints disagreed or their representatives, and the sacred fane was deserted for more than half-a-century. It was then converted to secular uses as the Common Hall of the City, and St. Nicholas being the lawyers' patron saint, there might be some pretence of fitness, but that it should afterwards degenerate into a mart for wcol \u2014 a Wool Hall, and finally"], [68, "56 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY become a play-house and a licensed Theatre- Royal was not so fit. These changes had been wrought in the course of centuries, and few who entered the obscure building under the shadow of the Cathedral, ever thought of its original use. Mr. Holmes did not. He led the two white-robed damsels past the great doors of a waggoner's warehouse on the ground floor, and up the staircase lo the hall above, with out troubling himself about the ancient uses of the edifice. He had taken places for the pit, and was more concerned in finding good seats for his companions than in aught else. Not so Muriel. Miss Briscoe had so impressed on her young mind in her pompous orations that all who entered the desecrated building were doomed to per dition, that she could not shake off a feeling of uneasiness ; and after a time ventured to entrust Mr. Holmes with her doubts and apprehensions. \" My good Miss D'Anyer,\" said he, \" don't"], [69, "A SCENE IN A TIIEA TRE. 57 perplex your young brain with questions so abstruse.

Their arrival certainly distracted Muriel's attention no little. She found herself wonder ing who the young lady sitting next to Arthur Wynne could be. She was not long left in doubt. Between the acts, Lucinda, who had given them all a good stare, leaned across her father and whispered : \" I say, Muriel, that's Sir Madoc Wynne and his daughter, and that other young fellow at the back is Sir Jenkyn Jenkinson.

And how his snuff-box sparkles, it might be all diamonds. I like him better than his daughter ; there is something scorn ful and imperious about her. I should not think she would suit Mr. Arthur, though she is so handsome; and that gold-llama dress does set her off wonderfully, though it is far too low in the neck, and the sleeves are much too short, to my mind.

It was meant as courtesy, but it only served to make her more conspicuous and"], [77, "A SCENE IN A THEATRE. 65 uncomfortable. She saw a scornful gleam in the questioning black eyes of Sir Madoc's daughter, and could almost imagine her speech to Mrs. Wynne was, \" Who are those queer people iu the pit ? \" Muriel heard little or nothing of the song which seemed to delight Mr. Holmes so mightily with its chorus of \"Fol-de-rol, too ra-loo,\" and which he applauded to the echo. All she could think was, how to get away before the country fellow at her elbow again made her a mark for all eyes, and claimed association with her, in the sight of every body. Who everybody was she did not stop to think. No sooner was the song over than she suggested, nay urged upon the good doctor that Mrs. Hopley would be angry if they stayed for the farce.

Her tranquil, patient eyes had a new light. Her doubts had been resolved. Arthur Wynne was neither haughty nor ungrateful, whatever his patrician mother might be ; and she would fain think Mr. Holmes and Lucinda both in error respecting her, though her faith was certainly shaken. The fresh air, the exercise, the gay scene, the excellent repast provided by the good surgeon, had all tended to refresh weary body and spirit ; but more than all the pleasant surprises of the day, the meeting with Mrs. Parry and Mr. Arthur f 2"], [80, "68 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. Wynne, had served to cheer aud brighten her. It was not much the latter had said, but quite enough to show that she was remembered gratefully, though as a child, and that his surprise at finding her a woman was not an unpleasant one. Moreover, his inquiries had embraced her grandmother, and uncle, and the Kingsleys. It was clear he did not seek to ignore them all. And nothing proved it so much as his open recognition in the theatre when surrounded by his own friends. From the importance she attached to the discovery, it would seem as if there had been a doubt lingering in her mind and troubling her. But in monotonous, uneventful lives, small matters do assume undue importance. Not that the retention or loss of a friend is a small matter by any means. At all events, she was blithe now the doubt was resolved. Mr. Holmes called early in the morning. He had an interview with Mrs. Hopley, during which the little mantua-maker took"], [81, "MRS.

She dwelt on the self-will and discontent and indolence of the young women, to whom she \"considered she had been almost a mother, training them, as she said, for future lives of industry and usefulness, by judicious discipline. Nothing was to be done without discipline in an establishment like hers. She was bound to keep insubordination down. And it was a difficult matter with two girls like Matilda Parkes and Lucinda Holmes under her roof ready at all times to incite others to rebellion. The best she could say for his daughter was that she had selected a good companion. She had certainly improved since Miss D'Anyer came, but that was not saying much, there was room for it ; and if Miss D'Anyer had taken to grumbling she was of opinion that companionship with Miss Holmes had not improved her A This was not a pleasant hearing for a father who had to take another's word for his daughter's conduct, and wdio knew of old that she had something of a spirit. It stirred the easy man to say, \" Miss D'Anyer did not"], [82, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 70 grumble ; but a doctor can read faces and appearances, and their faces spoke loudly enough. They spoke of too much work, and too little sleep, food, and fresh air. I should prescribe all three, Madam.

He was however afraid he had not much mended matters by his interference, and was glad to get the two girls out of the house to share a substantial breakfast with him at his inn, before he started for Northwich. That he ought to be on the road betimes he knew ; although Asa Booth, his young assistant, had come into his surgery when a bo3% as a pupil, and he could leave his ordi naiy patients to his care, there were cases not to be so left, and he was anxious to get back ; but for some unexplained reason he lingered, even after he had borne them company to the rapidly filling Walls, and declared he could not stay."], [83, "MRS.

Muriel had won his approbation, as a child ; and he could not forget that now she Avas the associate of his daughter. That she was a good one he had Mrs. Hopley's grudging testimony, still the little woman's remarks had made him uncom fortable. And he shared the common belief that red-coats and rakes were synonymous. He rode home on a somewhat uneasy saddle in consequence. He could but remember that he had himself brought Lucinda into contact with the officer ; aye, and her friend, too ; for the lieutenant would not himself have recognized Muriel, changed as she was. Miss Holmes remembered it also. \" Dear me, what a fuss father makes, to be sure ! \" she exclaimed as he went away. \" If a mere red-coat makes a man more dangerous than a black or a blue one, whj7 did he bring the lieutenant to us ? \" \" That puzzles me,\" responded Muriel, as they strolled along in the direction of the"], [85, "MRS.

Not until now had she confessed to herself that she looked forward eagerly to the pleasure of another meeting with Arthur Wynne. Not until now had she seen that pleasure and propriety were in antagonism."], [86, "74 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. \"Still ivhat?\" her companion asked, after a longer pause. Muriel's straying thoughts were recalled. \" Still \u2014 oh, I meant that we might be discreet without being discourteous, should we chance to meet Lieutenant Wynne ; but \u2014 a \u2014 I don't think the likelihood very great.\" \" Don't you ? \" droned out Lucinda in a tone of incredulity. Just then their attention was drawn to the animated scene on the racecourse below, where the horses were being recalled after a false start, and no more was said, on that subject. Presently Lucinda's sharp eyes descried Mrs. Wynne's pony carriage ; and she pointed out \u2014 unnecessarily \u2014 that the same young lady and elderly gentleman bore Mrs. Wynne company, and that the gallant officer and Sir Jenkyn were again in attendance on horse back. Muriel drew back. \"Come away, Lucinda ; don't let them see us staring at them.\""], [87, "MRS.

About half an hour later, when they had changed their position, and Muriel, weary of the shifting crowd, the cries, and the commo tion, was persuading her companion to quit the scene and make the circuit of the city walls for a quiet change, a brisk, firm step behind them stopped short, and in another minute Arthur Wynne was shaking hands with them. Not the slender youth with the pale face Muriel had first seen in the forest, but a fine, manly fellow nearly six feet high, with a noble forehead from which the hair, white with powder, was drawn back, thus exposing the lung-healed scar. His dark grey eves were set in well-moulded features, the nose being large without undue prominence, the lips at once tender and firm. \"How closely he resembles his handsome father ! \""], [88, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 76 was the swift thought of Muriel, as with a smile he began : \"It is quite a pleasure to meet you again. I was afraid Mr. Holmes might have spirited you off with him to Eddisbury or to Northwich this morning. I was summoned away j-esterday so abruptly, before I had well recovered my astonishment at the trans formation of Little Eed Riding Hood, and my speech with you at the theatre was so brief, that I had not presence of mind to ask if your visit to Chester would be prolonged through the race-week.\" This was not put as a question, yet Muriel felt it to be one, and perceived that he supposed her only a visitor ; and whether she was moved by the caution of Mr. Holmes, or by a touch of her father's pride, she answered merety, \" I am living in Chester at present, sir.\" He was \"delighted to hear it \u2014 thought it was probable they might meet again before he rejoined his regiment.

They were on their way to visit the same relatives when they had the good fortune to fall in with Eed Biding Hood and her friends, during Captain Wynne's sick leave,\" he said. Yet he did not seem to be the bearer of any message from his mother, and did not offer to take Muriel to speak to the lady, although the carriage was in sight and easily accessible ; nor did Mrs. Wynne bow, or even seem to recognize her, as she must surely have done had she known with whom her son had been conversing the previous afternoon, or had joined in the theatre, \u2014 or at least so the simple-minded young person thought. The fact was, there had been something narrowly approaching an altercation between the lady and her son overnight respecting that very young person.

Making much of her exhaustion and fa tigue after the excitement of the play, and the perilous drive home through the midnight air, Mrs. Wynne had expressed her intention to retire immediately, and re quired the assistance of her son, to enable her to surmount the stairs to her rooms. And to this no one seemed to object, not even Pauline. Mrs. Wynne herself, with all her languor and delicacy, had a little match-making on hand, it being her especial desire to secure Sir Madoc's daughter and heiress for her son. Sir Madoc and Captain Wynne were next of kin ; the wide estates of the baronet held stone for the quarrying above the surface, coal for the heAving beneath it ; but little besides the Plas itself AATould descend with the title.

The rain had almost ceased by the time he reached Dee Bridge (which then long and narrow span of seven arches Avas the only communication betAveen Chester and North Wales), and when he paid his toll at the Bridge-gate, after making his way through a throng of mud-bespattered ponies and frieze-coated Welshmen, some with pretty WelsliAVomen mounted on pillions behind, he had answered his OAvn question by others.

There Avas no gainsaying it. He had certainly shrined little Eed Eiding Hood in his memory, a memory of unselfish de votion to utter strangers ; of unstudied gifts and graces fresh from the mint of God. He had looked in lovely faces since, but they bore the stamp of the Avorld, and had not satisfied his soul. He had rarely stood before a glass to brush his hair, or sat there to have it dressed and poAvdered by his man, but he, seeing the scar, had remembered the pitying face that bent over him, the gentle fingers that picked out the broken glass and bound up his Avounded brow so tenderly.

He must have forgotten his appointment, for he passed the end of Castle Street Avith out turning his head, rode on up Bridge Street to the Flume of Feathers' Inn, and gave his horse in charge to an ostler without asking for any friend in waiting.

There he dropped into the postal box a"], [108, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 96 couple of letters, one bearing the address of Captain Wynne, the depot at Chatham (the main regiment Avas on service in St. Domingo), and received from the postmaster in answer to his enquiry a franked missive Avith a great red seal, and tAvo newspapers, the Times and the Morning Post.

Turning to retrace his steps through the umvonted bustle of Foregate Street, along Avhich crowds Avere hurrying singly and in groups, on foot, on horseback, in vehicles, in all stages of drink and excitement, pour ing out of the city at the close of the last day's race, he saw a young woman in a"], [109, "ON THE WAY TO THE POST. 97 cloak and pattens waiting Avith a letter in her hand as if for a favourable opportunity to cross the road to the Eost Office ; the hood of her cloak well draAvn over her bonnet as a protection from the rain, which Avas not quite over.

As she slowly recovered from her brief SAVOon, under the influence of fresh air and brandy administered with a teaspoon, recollection came of a rude thrust, a tAvisted patten and ankle, a fall, a glimpse of a monstrous horse, a dread of a crashing hoof, a confusion of cries and sounds, the rush of someone to the rescue, of a hand dragging her up, of her oavii SAvift thankfulness. It was like waking from a dream ; yet there was her deliverer, and her ankle pained her Avhen she strove to stand alone. Still she made the effort braA~ely, alarmed at finding the daylight going, people around her, a woman tying on her bonnet, herself in Arthur Wynne's clasp ; though her gratitude was too great for expression, and she felt that his presence there Avas nothing less than proA'idential.

HoAvever reluctantly, she Avas compelled by pain to accept Lieutenant Wynne's proffer ; and Avhether he Avas more pleased or sorry at her refusal to go home in a sedan is scarcely to be told : or whether she was more thankful for his support, or ashamed to take his arm in her deplorable plight, is just as doubtful.

And he concluded she had an all-sufficient motive for rejecting his proposi tion, with so much agony as an alternative, and in all his intercourse with his cousin, Pauline Wynne, he had never felt the touch of her jeAvelled fingers as he felt whilst Muriel's mittened hand rested on his arm, or gave an involuntary grip when an out sized pebble in the uneven pavement caused a sharper twinge than before. Gladly would he have suffered in her stead, and he told her so, and bade her lean upon him more securely. \" You cannot think what a pleasure it is to serve you, hoAveATer slightly.

She wished then she had thought less of Mrs. Hopley's indignation, and more of consequences to her courteous companion. Then the caution of Dr. Holmes came"], [117, "ON THE WAY TO THE POST. 105 back to her with crushing force. She, sent away from home for reasons to her inscrutable, overtasked and OA*erAvorked, un cared for by the mistress to whom she Avas bound, associating with girls of a lower grade, had felt as if a breath from Paradise had Avafted across her since Arthur had shaken hands with her again.

With his departure night seemed to have set in for Muriel. She opened the door, groped her Avay up the dark staircase, halting on every step, and hoping to find a light in the work-room ; but it Avas deserted. There was a noise and a scuffle in the nurserj-, as if the children Avere going to bed. She opened the door softly. She was a favourite there. The children, big and little, dressed and undressed, came croAvding around her, with Avondering questions and alarm, to Avhich her pale face, her crushed bonnet, muddy cloak, and halting gait gave rise. She explained that she had been knocked down, nearly run over, had sprained her ankle, and wanted a light ; but she did not think it essential to name the gentleman who had preserved her, or to say that he had brought her to the door."], [120, "108 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. She said she was faint and Aveary, and Avould go to bed ; and the servant-lass, seeing how ill she appeared, offered to bathe the injured ankle ; but no one suspected that her heart was aching worse than the foot, though she lay in bed all the morroAv, her only companion and comforter being her mother's priceless gift, the little siher-clasped Bible. And surely she had need of her guide and comforter. If she bore her daily burden passively, it Avas not because she did not knoAv its Aveight, but that she never added to it Avith useless murmuring. Most of the other girls gave vent to their irritation, or indignation, or splenetic feeling in divers ways. Snappish words, snapped threads, a slip of scissors or needle in spiteful inadvertence, the upset of a pin-tray, the snuffing out of candles, the wilful mislaying of card, or stiletto, or patterns, or the mysterious misplacing of the bees-wax on Mrs. Hopley's chair to the detriment of her black gown. And to them every holiday was a carnival."], [121, "ON THE WAY TO THE POST. 109 She, differing in birth, in temperament, and in training, had no such outlets for her emotions. Her nature and her conscience restrained her. She could simply endure in silence, and the strength to do it she found under the black cover of the old book. The others had ceased to jeer at her as a \"Methody\" and \"a milksop,\" since she nevrer obtruded her opinions unsought, and Lucinda Holmes had in fact become her champion ; but that Avas needless, Muriel was not weak, she was only non-combative. They had all gone to church in the morn ing in their Sunday best, for the rain had ceased the previous evening and the sun shone gloriously, even lighting up the bare attic where Muriel lay. True, Mrs. Hopley's youngest, a child some five or six years old, avIio had a grateful remembrance of one avIio, Avhen she bumped her head in falling down stairs, \"Ran to catch her as she fell, And kissed the place to make it well,\" and who had helped to nurse her through"], [122, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 110 one or tAvo childish ailments, with so much patience and loving sympathy, and who told such pretty tales Avhen she was getting better ; this little one came to her bedside and prettily enough offered to \" come and stay Avith you, instead of going to church, if mother will let me, Miss D'Anyer. I'll tell her Iioav bad your foot is.\" But the little one never came back upstairs, so Muriel knew Mrs. Hopley had been less gracious than the little one, or had had a different sense of duty.

She had lain there that day more troubled about her lost letter, and her lost friend, than about her SAVollen ankle, or her own isolation.

That a stain darker than the brand of Cain should rest upon the duellist was a daring assumption, one not in accord with the military code of honour, but he was then at an impressionable age and the novel theory of the unsophisticated child had certainly impressed him. Possibly as en forcing the creed of his old tutor, a man of rare worth and excellence who was given to think for himself. At all events Muriel's remark had served to restrain him many a time before ; it served him in good stead then. He left 1 2"], [128, "116 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. the convivial and noisy party, Avith Sir Madoc at their head, to their mirth and their wine, simply saying that he had a letter of impor tance to answer ; and though someone darted after him to draAv him back, he did not return.

He lost none of his oavii dignity, and he did make some of the rude jesters a little ashamed. Something of his \" absurd civility to a bedraggled damsel \" reached the ears of Mrs. Wynne and of Pauline, but the important missive of Avhich he Avas the bearer, filled the mind of the former to the exclusion of all minor matters.

But of these regrets Mrs. Wynne said nothing Avhen communicating the main fact to Sir Madoc and Miss Wynne over the break fast-table that Sunday morning. She looked as if a neAv honour had fallen on herself, yet at the same time affected an air of easy indifference which imposed on no one. Her son made no secret of his satisfaction, and Sir Madoc greAv important. The news papers containing the official gazette were duly circulated, and Major Wynne was the topic of the hour. Not until the ladies had retired to dress for church had Sir Madoc an opportu nity to say in private to his nephew, \" I say, Arthur, how is it you have not stepped into your father's old shoes ? \" \" Perhaps, sir, they were considered too large for me to fill,\" the young man answered Avith a pleasant smile. \" but jesting apart, I could scarcely expect to take precedence of our senior lieutenant ; and there would have been good reason for jealousy had"], [130, "118 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. father and son both been promoted the same day ; although I believe my father expected it ; some promise of the kind AATas made to him last year.\" \"Then, I say, I hope you are not dis appointed, look you ? \" And out came Sir Madoc's snuff-box, to be offered mechanically to Arthur, and declined Avith a boAv. \" Disappointed !

She and Sir Madoc exchanged enquiring glances across the long table from time to time, but they did not bring back Arthur Wynne, or prevent Pauline from smiling on the beaming Sir Jenkyn. Festivities did not end AATith the race-week. Balls and routs, notably one at Eaton House, were to follow.

It added now to the anxiety Avith which she contemplated her coming watch by Muriel's side at the inn, instead of driving over to Eddisbury at once and leaving her there in charge of Mrs. Kingsley and Dr. Holmes whilst she came back to buy and sell in Chester ; as had been her intention.

The Avords fell from Mrs. Griffiths' lips like the cooling drops from a fountain of sweet waters, and did much to soothe Muriel's pain, and tranquilize her spirit, disturbed alike by the accusation and the altercation about herself at Mrs. Hopley's ; and the suggested possibility of amputation.

The presence of Mrs. Griffiths set her at liberty, and as she had calculated, the large bales of skins Sam had duly despatched to the Manchester Hall were exchanged for piles of flannel or linen, or hard cash before the fair was over ; and the old dame took credit to herself for the smart way in which she had turned her unfore seen journey to account. o 2"], [208, "196 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY.

There was, however, the freshness of country air and his two-mile walk upon Joe Bent, Avhose paternal abode lay outside the town on the north-east, he came armed, not with a SAVord, but a nosegay and a small basket of grapes from the Grange, and he had a triumphant smile as he presented his early morning offering.

Suddenly there was a bustle, the horses Avere there, there was a noisy backing to their places, a buckling of straps and harness. The guard looked to the priming of his blunderbuss, ladders Avere reared against the coach for the outside passengers, nimble ones mounted by the wheels, the \"insides\" AA-ere seated, coachman and guard in their places, the whip cracked, the horn was bloAvn, John D'Anyer raised his hat, the last adieus were AAraved to them as the four bounding steeds bore them away from SAvan Yard, round the corner, up Market-street Lane, along Lever's Bow and Biccadilly and the steep Bank Top to Shooter's BroAV, where the toAvn seemed to end and the country begin, for the last reeking lamp was left behind, and trees and hedges faintly shadoAved forth seemed to glide past like ghosts in the mist of the summer morn.

At least, so felt Ellen D'Anyer, whose journeyings had rarely extended beyond church or market, or the homes of mother and mother-in-laAv, and to whom the leaving home for a day Avas momentous. \"John Avas so uncertain, and travelling such a risk.\" Muriel, Avho considered herself quite a traveller, inhaled the fresh air Avithout a mis giving. \" Don't fear, mother, all will go well at home,\" she leaned forAvard to say; \"I feel as if there Avas a blessing in the breeze, and health and happiness in store for both of us. And don't you remember what you used to tell me, that Ave were safe if God's holy angels had us in their keeping?\" \"Bless the girl! yes!\" was the astonished answer, and no more was said.

And whether from overmuch business, or from a lack of business, or from the natural sloth of the animal, quite half an hour elapsed before the man turned up with a straw in his mouth and a horsey perfume about him, in response to the red-faced landlord's repeated call of \" Tim, Tim, Avhere are you ? \" The coming of the coach Avas an evident intrusion on Tim's lazyhood.

Their up-hill and doAvn-dale journey had pretty well shaken appetite out of them. And rest was all that either Avanted just then. Had either of them gone to a AvindoAv and looked down upon the level road between the Bank and the Old Hall they might havTe descried someone then driving past in a luxurious open carriage pettishly making the same complaint : \" wanting rest and finding none.\" It was not four o'clock yet, the heat and glare of the day had subsided, Avhen Mrs. D'Anyer and Muriel sauntered forth before tea to see the toAvn and search for the hot baths ; the former with the aid of her crutched stick, and Muriel's arm. They were speedily found at the end of the magnificent Crescent the Duke of Devonshire VOL. II.

A sedan chair was leaving the baths, from which a querulous feminine voice complained of the chairman's roughness. \" The clumsy brutes have shaken me to pieces ! \" The voice was that of Mrs. Wynne, and in attendance Muriel recognized her stolid maid Owen and \u2014 yes, Arthur Wynne himself.

Yet there Avas nothing of undue familiarity"], [271, "FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER HEALTH. 259 in the manner of his approach, and though he put forth his hand it was with a sort of semi-apology, accompanied at the same time by a respectful, if slight, inclination of the head towards the elder lady. \"Will you pardon me, Miss D'Anyer, if I venture to arrest your steps whilst I express my surprise at meeting you here ? I trust that ill-health has not driven you hither to recruit your strength ; \" and Muriel saw that the words AA^ere no idle compliment. She had laid her soft palm in his, though with scarcely the frank fearlessness of that first meeting on the Walls of Chester, and there was not the same unconscious steadiness of voice. \" Only in part, sir ; I am better than I have been. It is my mother who seeks the benefit of the Buxton Avaters,\" and looking lovingly in the worn face of which her own was a far off reflex, she said, \" Mother, you will be glad of this opportunity to thank Lieutenant Wynne for the life of your child.\" The wave of doubt, and surmise what s 2"], [272, "260 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. strange acquaintance Muriel had formed in her long absence, SAvept aAvay from Mrs. D'Anyer's broAV ; her hand Avent forth to his in perfect trust and satisfaction. \" Indeed I shall,\" she said Avith feeling, \"you made me for ever your debtor, sir, when you bravely threAv yourself between my beloved Muriel and the hoofs which else would have trampled her to death.

Let us not ignore his politeness so far as to say this was intentional; but impulse Avaits on thought and feeling, and both outrival electricity in speed. He had seen nothing of Muriel since he had left her at Mrs. Hopley's door, an object of the tenderest compassion, the warmest admiration, the deepest respect. She had dismissed him, and forbidden his return or inquiry, at the instigation of duty, not inclination ; and he had respected her motives with a degree of delicacy rare enough, and in so doing had bound the broad fillet of \" honour \" round impulse and emotion. It was that same honour which had restrained his pen when every other feeling in his breast bade him give his love and admiration Avords. Yet he had not gone forth intent on crushing the rising passion in his breast as incompatible with duty, but bent on moulding circumstances to his will, and making love and honour one."], [274, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 262 Hoav he might have acted had he con templated Muriel's removal from Chester in his absence there is no knoAving ; there is a weak spot in every hero's breastplate.

And iioav, called from his military duties to attend his invalid mother for a brief period, his good fortune had brought him face to face with the lost ! He might disguise his delight beneath common con ventional courtesy, but it Avas too real to permit another parting Avithout some looking forward to another meeting. He \" Avould not lose sight of her so hopelessly again ; that he Avas determined.\" On the other hand, Muriel Avas no less pleased to meet her \" true friend \" once again, than to introduce her hero, her \" Prince Arthur \" to her beloved mother, and the ribbons in her straAV hat, the spots on her printed linen gown, or the sash Avhich fluttered below her silken scarf, Avere not rosier than the face he looked down upon AATith such a light of satisfaction in his own.

No wonder he lingered in the hope of infor mation ; and though she seemed strangely tongue-tied, Mrs. D'Anyer Avas not. So as he stood there before them in his military undress, in form, feature, bearing, the very model of a man and a gentleman, the conversational shuttlecock was kept in motion, shyly at first by Muriel, to whom her grandmother's warning recurred afresh, till at length restraint had Avorn off, and he had learned much with which the reader is already acquainted, not excluding the causes which had led to her removal from Mrs. Hopley's and her visit to Buxton. He ground his teeth in a spirit of anything but charity towards that queer priestess of fashion ; but, as it dawned upon him that the ball-dress casually named in reference to Muriel's long hours and night-work, when her foot required rest, must be one and the same with that airy blue gauze which had draped with such fatal lightness round his own mother's form, he recalled the scorn"], [278, "266 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. and contempt with which Mrs. Wynne had spoken of the sweet girl before him as the \" mantua-maker's apprentice at work on her own robe.\" It was by no means a pleasant reminder, whether he regarded the penalty his own mother had paid for her devotion to fashion, or her instrumentality in adding to the pain of Muriel, or the hitter's legal subjection to the unfeeling old mantua-maker. And I am not sure the last was the least discordant note in the trio. A man may be deeply in love, and sensitive regarding inequality of rank at the same time, and in spite of chivalry, love and pride will have a fight for the mastery. \" Cruelty ! Barbarity ! \" he had inter jected between the pauses of Mrs. D'Anyer's speech, but he listened with fresh interest as she proceeded to say, \"It Avas never with my good-will that a child of mine Avas removed from our oavii hearth to be placed with strangers at a distance. It was all my mother's doin\u00b0'."], [279, "FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER HEALTH 267 and I could never fully penetrate her motives. She must certainly have been misled in her estimate of Mrs. Hopley, for I know Avell she had Muriel's welfare at heart.\" \" Oh, yes, I am certain of that,\" inter rupted Muriel, not sorry to have this ex planation made. \" I only marvel Mr. D'Anyer gaAre his consent, considering his own excessive pride of birth,\" continued the mother more in private rumination than for the listener's ear, though she added as a climax, \" and to think that she should be compelled to go back to serve so hard a taskmistress for more than another year almost breaks my heart !\" \"And mine,\" was the vibrating echo in the breast of Arthur Wynne, who looked in Muriel's face and Avondered Iioav she could so calmly lay her hand on her mother's arm and say, \" Never mind, mother dear, things may be better when I go back.\" But he came to the just conclusion that the girl was only hiding her own disquiet, in order to allay that of her parent."], [280, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 268 Shortly after that he took his departure, but not before he had made known that his leave expired very shortly, having been granted solely to permit his attendance on Mrs. Wynne during her painful and tedious journey from Wales. He had moreover obtained permission to call on the ladies at their lodgings on Hall Bank. That gained, he strode forth into the open air, as if the ground was firmer under his feet than it had been an hour before. \" Quite a gentlewoman, is Mrs. D'Anyer,\" Avas his mental ATerdict as he crossed the arc of the Crescent. \" A very courteous and affable young gentleman,\" remarked Mrs. D'Anyer Avhen Muriel returned to her side after making arrangements for their daily baths, and as if revolving the question in her own mind ; \" And so that lady in the chair was Mrs. Wynne!

Both he and Major Wynne are true gentlemen. Yet I am very sorry for Mrs. Wynne. Mrs. Parry told us she was quite a cripple.

She can go to no more balls and races now.\" \" Well, my dear, a woman at her time of life should be thinking of something more serious than balls and entertainments.
