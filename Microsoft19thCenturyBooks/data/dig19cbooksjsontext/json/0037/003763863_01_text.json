TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL SIR RICHARD WYNNE, OF GWEDIR, BARONET, _tntr tJniyfit for tfic Counts of Carnarban in tjis prrsent JJarlamrnt. Sir, I had designed this small Treatise (being the first fruits of my study in Antiquities) for your honoured Father; but failing of my purpose by reason of his death (which was untimely to his friends, though not to himself) I thought I might not (without being highly injurious) present a thing once devoted to him to any else besides yourself, who as his heir might lay a just claime to it, and also to my most humble services; I promise myself you will vouchsafe it a kind entertainment, since (I know) both your goodnesse and your interest in the subject, as lineally descended from the Princes of North Wales (whose rights are therein maintained) are more than sufficient to ob lige you thereto. The writing of it was upon this occasion: Some Gentlemen of South Wales being dissatisfied with Caradoc of Lan carvan's History of Wales, published by Dr. Powel, in regard that therein the Prince of North Wales is held forth to be Soveraigne over the other two Princes of South Wales and Powys, as being of the elder house, thought fit (in order to the compiling of a more exact history) to draw up certain arguments for the soveraignty of all Wales to be in the Prince of South Wales, and to send them also into North Wales to see what could be said in answer to them, before any further use should be made of them. They were delivered by Sir Thomas Canon, late of Pembrokeshire, Knight, to Sir John Lloyd, of the Inner Temple, Knight, and Sergeant at Law, who delivered them to me above 40 years ago, desiring I would take the pains to peruse and answer them as well as I was able. At his intreaty I undertook it,"], [12, "THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY. and, as you will find, done somewhat in it, though in a rude manner, which I hope will be excused in a person, whose only designe is plainly to set forth the truth, which shews always best in its own proper colours without the elaborate dresse and varnish of Rhetorick. But some men possibly may object against this undertaking of mine, that it was needlesse, and that, if it had been to any end, it was no discretion to revive and publish an old Contest long since (God be praised) happily decided. I confesse we have reason to blesse God for his mercy to us in our happy establishment under one Monarch, we may well say we were conquered to our gain, and undone to our advantage, periissemus nisi periissemus ; but yet it must be granted, that it is no small delight that redounds from the revolving and peru sall of old records : though Troy hath for severall ages layn buried in its ashes, both its glory and government being quite dissolved, though the Athenian, Spartan, Theban, and other petit Grecian Estates have long since had their periods, yet we still take a great deale of satis faction in reading their stories, how they began, grew up, flourished, strove, and decayed. Besides there may be this good use made of it, viz. that by reflecting upon our former miseries and divisions while we contended for soveraignty, we may be induced to put the greater value upon our present happinesse. Thus having given you an account of the worke, and what I had to say in its defence, I com mend it to your protection: and with my prayers to God for you and your noble family, remain, Sir, Your faithfull Servant at command, ROBERT VAUGHAN.

The seventeenth century was fertile in great characters, in the state and in the church, as well as in every department of science and literature. It was a period in our history full of action and enquiry, lamentable indeed often in its progress, but terminating in many beneficial results..\u2014 In the literary annals of the Principality no name stands higher than that of Robert Vaughan; but much as he contributed to raise the reputation of his country, it is to be regretted that our accounts of him and his studies are so slender. That was not an age of memoir and anecdote; men were satisfied with discharging their private and public duties, and but little solicitous to gratify curiosity by details of their own or of the private life and habits of others. Robert Vaughan, as Wood in his Ath\u00e6n\u0153 justly says, was of an \" eminent and genteel family in Merionethshire,\" being the eldest son of Howel Vaughan, Esq. and Margaret his wife, a grand-daughter of Lewis Owen, Chamberlain and Baron of North Wales, whose tragical death at a place called since Llidiart \\% Banvn, or the Baron's Gate, near Dinas Mowddu, is to this day a subject of horror and reproba tion among our countrymen.* Mr. Vaughan was born in 1592, at Hengwrt, near Dolgelleu; his grand-father having married the heiress of that place, had removed the family mansion from Gwengraig, where his ancestors had resided for many ge nerations. But the seat of the parent or original stock was Nannau, from which in the sixth descent from Cadwgan of Nannau, the second son of Bleddyn ap Cynvyn, the founder of the Royal Tribe of that name, Howel Vychan separated and settled at Gwengraig. And it is somewhat extraordinary, that after many ages and changes in human affairs, the two branches became united again, and remain so at this day in their patriotic descendant and representative, Sir Robert Williames Vaughan, of Nannau, Baronet, and Member of Parliament for the County of Merioneth. \u00bb Vide Pennant's Wales, ami Yorke's Royal Tribes."], [18, "LIFE OF THE AUTHOR. It is often gratifying to trace the earliest steps of those who have done honour or service to their country; but at this distance of time we have no certain information under what masters or at what school Robert Vaughan was first educated. When he was about twenty years of age he entered in 1612 a Commoner of Oriel College in Oxford. Having passed through the regular course of studies pursued at that pe riod in Logic and Philosophy, he left the University without taking a degree, and retired to his patrimony at Hengwrt in his native county. Enjoying the advantages of a good estate, and incited by a patriotic spirit, he here cultivated those studies that have rendered his name so celebrated, and of such authority on all subjects connected with British history and antiquities. To this end also he was engaged in an extensive correspondence with persons of similar taste and pursuits, among whom we may with pride justly enumerate the great and good Archbishop Usher, two of his letters to whom are printed in the life of that prelate by his chaplain Parr, and also in the second volume of that excellent work the Cambrian Register. In one of these letters it is grievous to find Mr. Vaughan obliged to tell his friend, \" My love and zeal to know the truth and certainty of things past moves me sometimes to a passion, when I call to mind the idle and sloth ful life of my countrymen, who, in the revolution of a thousand years almost, afford but only Caradoc of Lancarvan, and the continuation thereof, to register any thing, to purpose, of the acts of the Princes of Wales, that I could come by, or hear of, some piece-meals excepted.\" With Sir Symonds D' Ewes, an eminent antiquarian of his day, and the learned Selden, he corresponded on the ancient British laws and philology, and gave them his assistance in their researches on these points. In all his letters his modesty in propounding his opinions is observable, and exceeded only by his learning. Another of his friends and correspondents was the Rev. Thomas Ellis, B. D. born at Dolbenmaen, in Caernarvonshire, some time Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, and latterly Rector of Dolgelleu. Mr. Ellis was elected Fellow of his College when Dr. Mansell was Principal, who was noted for his prudence and impartiality in selecting young men of talent and conduct on the foundation. Much indeed of the welfare of the Principality, and particularly of its Church, will alway? depend on the discipline and learning maintained in that society. \" Ellis,\" as Wood says, \" was a person of solid learning, and a singular lover of the antiquities of his"], [19, "LIFE OF THE AUTHOR. country.\" He left behind in manuscript a History of the Life of Owain Glyndwr, which was afterwards published by the Rev. John Thomas, Head Master of Beau maris School, as an Appendix to his Supplement of Rowland's Mona Antiqua. In one of his letters to the Archbishop, alluding to the troubles of the times, and his own abhorrence of them, Mr. Vaughan speaks of his friend Ellis, as one \" who in these dangerous times hath suffered many assaults and storms from hie adversaries, with patience and constancy.\" From the following imperfect account of his labours, it is evident Mr. Vaughan was seldom idle. He wrote notes or commentaries on the manuscript book of Ba singwerk Abbey \u2014 on Nennius \u2014 on the Triads, together with an English translation \u2014 on Caradoc of Lancarvan's Brut or Chronicle, with a collation of ten several copies, on vellum \u2014 on Leland's New Year's Gift \u2014 on Burton's Antoninus \u2014 on Dr. Powel's History of Wales \u2014 on Ushers Primordia \u2014 Ball's Catalogus Scriptorum \u2014 Annals of Wales from Vortigern downwards, translated from the original into En glish, with notes \u2014 a short Account of the Family of Cors y Gedol \u2014 a Topography of Merionethshire\u2014 and a Tour to St. David's, being short and cursory notices of the places he passed through, in going and returning. But his chief work, and the only one published in his life-time, is the British Antiquities Revived, to which is added the Pedigree of the Earl of Carbery, and a short Account of the Five Royal Tribes of Cambria. The object of this work was to put an end to a controversy then subsisting in the Principality on the primogeni ture of the sons of Roderic the Great, who, on the unhappy division of his kingdom, had given the northern parts of Wales to Anarawd, the southern to Cadell, and Powys to Mervyn. In after times, the south Welshmen contended that their Cadell was the eldest of the three; but this is denied with such zeal and effect by our author that the advocates of Cadell have ever since given up the contest in favour of Anar awd. The dispute may appear to us in these degrading days unimportant; but it was not so then: and the learning and force of argument, together with the clearness of the language brought to bear on the subject, as well as many collateral points, will give it always an interest in the eye of an enquirer into the details of the history of the Principality of Wales."], [20, "LIFE OF THE AUTHOR. The art of printing having not yet become common, British literature was at this time, and for many years afterwards, confined almost exclusively to manuscripts; and these, after the dilapidation of the monasteries in which they had been religi ously preserved, had now fallen into a multitude of hands, were widely scattered, and rudely neglected. It was therefore of much consequence, and Mr. Vaughan saw the necessity, and probably was the only one of his age capable for the task, of bringing together, arranging, and illustrating these ancient treasures. To this end he spared neither pains nor expence to procure original copies, or correct transcripts. As a proof of the zeal and diligence with which he pursued his object, we may men tion the manuscript Book of Llandaff, or Liber Landavensis. The original had been long before conveyed to England, and not a copy was to be found in Wales; but Mr. Vaughan knew the original to have been once in the possession of Selden, who was lately dead.* He therefore became very anxious to get the book, or an accurate copy of it. For this purpose he wrote several letters to his friend Mr. Meredydd Lloyd of Welshpool, and his cousin Mr. Herbert of Llwyn Iorwerth, in Cardigan shire, and also to Mr. Vaughan of Trawscoed. At last he offers to enter into a bond, in conjunction with his son Robert, to a considerable amount, to warrant the security of the manuscript ; which, after much enquiry, was at length discovered in the public library at Oxford, and transmitted to him. f By these means the Library at Hengwrt amounted at last to one hundred and sixty five volumes in manuscript, many of which were of very ancient date, on vellum, and several of them were copies in Mr. Vaughan's own hand-writing, in which he much excelled, or in the hand-writing of a ready amanuensis, whom he constantly employed. These volumes exhibit not only much perseverance and labour, but most of them are made doubly valuable by the judicious observations and copious addi tions ot Robert Vaughan. Of the collection indeed twenty eight volumes were in the hand-writing of Mr. Jones of Gelli Lyfdy, near Caerwys, Flintshire, it having * Notwithstanding the vastness of his learning, and all Hie books he had ever read and digested, Selden observed towards the close of his life, that nothing of them all gave him so much solid satisfaction as a single passage of St Paul- Titus, chap. ii. \\erses 11, \u2014 14. t Vide Cambrian Register, Vol. III."], [21, "LIFE OF THE AUTHOR. been mutually agreed upon between them, that the survivor should become the pos sessor of the manuscript treasures of the other; and therefore on Mr. Jones dying first, his writings were removed to Hengwrt: and this was fortunate, for Jones was merely a zealous transcriber, pursuing his labours for nearly half a century with much in dustry, but not always with judgment. Another cotemporary collector was Mr. William Maurice of Cefn y Braich, in Llansilin, Denbighshire, who delighted in the designation of Llansiliensis at the foot of his labours. Maurice made a cata logue of the Hengwrt Library, of which there is a copy in the Library at Mostyn, another at Plasgwyn in Anglesey, and a transcript in the possession of that eminent British scholar and bard, the Rev. Walter Davies, the present worthy Rector of Manafon, Montgomeryshire. The difficulties attendant on forming such a collection by one person, we cannot now adequately appreciate: the benefit and advantages however of having a Library of such original materials, in the Principality, have been invariably acknowledged, and the name of Vaughan mentioned with sentiments of esteem and obligation by every author almost from that day to this who has written on the early history of the kingdom. In his valuable additions to Camden, Bishop Gibson has in many copious extracts availed himself of the learning of Robert Vaughan; and Bishop Nicholson, in his Historical Library, or view of the early writers of this kingdom, speaks most highly of him. Mr. Edward Llwyd, in a letter to Humphrey Wanley, dated Swansea, Sept. 14, 1796, says, \" Mr. Robert Vaughan was the first in these latter days that could read the inscription on Eliseg's column, near the Valle Crucis Abbey.\" He sent a copy of it to Archbishop Usher, and the Primate sent one to Dr. Langbaine. Mr. Vaughan probably took his copy whilst the column was stand ing, before the Cromwellians threw it from its pedestal. Mr. Kynaston of Pant y Byrsle took a transcript of Mr. Vaughan's inscription, from which there is every reason to believe that now in general circulation was taken. To these testimonies may be added the names of the late Evan Evans, Warrington, Yorke, and those two eminent Welsh scholars, Dr. William Owen Pugh, and the Rev. Walter Davies. Of the Library the greater part is still remaining, though much has been unhappily lost through negligence, and much it is to be feared borrowed and never returned; but of late, many valuable manuscripts have been recovered by the care and attention"], [22, "LIFE OF THE AUTHOR of Colonel Vaughan of Rug and Hengwrt, who takes just pride and pleasure in possessing and preserving unimpaired those ancient treasures and labours of his an cestor, and in furnishing the scholar, the bard, and the lover of antiquity with a ready access to them. The Honourable Daines Barrington, in his Introduction to the History of the Gwydir Family, is inclined to give Mr. Vaughan credit for skill in engraving, as his name is affixed to the well known portrait of Sir John Wynne; and which he thinks also the more probable, as he was a particular friend of Sir John Wynne, as well as of his son Sir Richard, to whom he dedicated his book, the \" British Antiquities Re vived.\" The supposition however must be a mistake, as Granger, whose authority on all such subjects is indisputable, positively says, that the name under the portrait was that of another Robert Vaughan, a native of England.* Occupied as Robert Vaughan must necessarily have been with his learned pursuits, he did not however neglect the duties every one in his rank and station owes to society; for we are informed that he acted as a magistrate in his neighbourhood ; and though, from his love of study and retirement, he did not engage in the bloody and unnatural conflicts of the civil war of those unhappy times, he maintained his loyalty inviolate, and firmly adhered to the ancient institutions of his country. He married Catharine daughter of Gruffydd Nannau, of Nannau, Esq. by whom he had eight children, the eldest of whom, Hywel, succeeded his father in his estate. Having lived to a good old age, he died at his beloved Hengwrt in the year 16(56, and was buried in the parish church of Dolgelleu. \u00bb Vide our ingenious countrywoman Angharad Llwyd's Edition of the History of the Gwydir Family :\u2014 and also Granger, Vol. IV. p. 74."], [23, "THE STATE OF THE QUESTION. Roderic the Great, King of Wales, about An. Dom. 876, did dispose the three Principalities thereof to three\" of his sons, viz. South Wales to Cadelh, who is maintained in this treatise to be the eldest; North Wales to Anarawd, who is held by some late writers of North Wales to be the eldest; and Powys to Mervyn, who is held by some other writers of North Wales to be the eldest (which being least probable, as touching Mervyn): the Question here is, Whether Cadelh or Anarawd were the eldest son of Roderic the Great, and which of them had the soveraigne power and rule over all Wales."], [24, ""], [25, "BRITISH ANTIQUITIES. ARGUMENTS PROVING CADELH PRINCE OF SOUTH WALES TO BE THE ELDEST SON OF RODERIC THE GREAT (KING OF WALES) AND THAT HE, AND HIS ISSUE AFTER HIM, HAD A SUPERIORITY OVER THE REST OF THE PRINCES, OVER HIS TWO BRETHREN, AND THE DESCENDANTS FROM THEM. THE FIRST ARGUMENT. The Principalitie of Powys, after the death of Mervyn, the youngest brother (who died without issue, according to the most credible writers of the Antiquities of Wales) descended to Cadelh, as the eldest brother and heir, and from him to Howel Dha his son, and so to Bledhyn ap Convyn by due course of inheritance from Cadelh. And for the opinion that Mervyn had a son named Lhewelyn (whose daughter and heir was married to Meredith ap"], [26, "8 Owen, third son of Owen ap Howel Dha, and great grandchild to Cadelh) and that thereby Powys came to the line of Cadelh, it is fit the authority thereof do appear, before it receive credit. Likewise, whereas some writers for North Wales do alledge, that Cadelh took Powys by force from his brethren after the death of his brother Mervyn; it is therefore impliedly confessed, that Mervyn had no children: and it is not unlike that he actually entred into and seized Powys as his inheritance, and that his brethren might pretend to have portions there by gavel-kind upon the death of their brother Mervyn. But could he carry a Prin cipality from all the race of Roderic (who had diverse sons, besides those three princes) by strong hand, and without right or opposition? Whereas it doth not appear throughout the whole course of the Histories of Wales, that either there was any stirre or claime made by the Prince of North Wales, or any of the descent of Roderic for Powys, or any entries made by them into that country, until after the soveraignty thereof came to the King of England, by the conquering of Rees ap Theodor, that they made head in those parts as in other parts of Wales against the invasion of the Lords Marchers, whereas they might have done it most easily, seeing it wholly bordereth on North Wales, and is farthest from South Wales, and especially being incited and warranted thereunto for recovery of their right. And if a judgment may be made that that which is ill gotten cannot long"], [27, "9 endure, Et de male partis tertius h\u00e6res non gaudebit, then let the long continued descent of diverse parts of Powys, in the heirs of Cadelh, plead for him that he came justly and lawfully to it: for the Lordship of Mowthwy being a part of Powys is enjoyed to this day, by descent from Cadelh. And a great part thereof was held (until of late time) by Grey Lo. Powys by like descent, and the rest of the possessions continued long in his posterity and line, untill by partition they were branched into diverse families, whereof a great part is now in the Crown by severall meanes; howbeit the soveraignty remained still in the heires of Cadelh, as Prince of South Wales, which appeareth by their chastising the defections, and taking pledges for the obedience of the Lords of Powys, and such testimonies of soveraignty related by the writers of North Wales. It is alledged also by some of them, that the possession of Powys was witheld by the heires of Brochwel Ysgythroc, who was Prince thereof about An. Dom. 617. If that were true, then Cadelh did not take Powys by force from his brethren. But for the truth hereof Roderic was lineall heir to Brochwel Ysgythroc, viz. son of Mervyn Vrych, son of Nest, sister and heir of Cyngen, son to Cadelh, son to Brochwel Ysgythroc. And thereby Roderic had both the right and possession of Powys. And therefore untill another heir be found, or other descents appear from Brochwel Ysgythroc to Bledhyn ap Convyn, then by the line of Roderic"], [28, "10 the Great, and all the persons be mentioned that held Powys in all that time, other then the line of Roderic, the beliefe of this allegation may be well suspended. And thus the way is cleared to conclude upon this first point, that Cadelh was the eldest and soveraigne Prince of Wales by the descending of Powys unto him."], [29, "11 ANARAWD MAINTAINED TO BE THE ELDEST SON OF RODERIC THE GREAT, AND TO HAVE THE RIGHT OF SOVERAINGTY OVER ALL WALES, AND SO LIKEWISE HIS SUCCESSORS THE PRINCES OF NORTH WALES. THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST ARGUMENT. The later Prince of Powys held that by inheritance from the third son of Roderic the Great, as Mr. Camden in these words declareth: Powissi\u00e6 principes a tertio filio Roderici Magni prognati hunc agrum (viz. Mountgomerieshire) cum aliis perpetud serie ad Ed. 2. tempora tenuerunt. Therefore Cadelh Prince of South Wales (out of whose loines the later Princes of Powys were descended) must of necessity be the third son of Roderic the Great, which degree of birth the white book of Hergest, Tho. Maylor, Jo. Leland, Hum. Llwyd, Myles, and many more both modern and ancient authors do attribute to Cadelh by name. And if to avoid that, you will say that Camden by tertio filio did not mean Cadelh, then must Mervyn be the man, and consequently"], [30, "12 he must have issue, else the later Princes of Powys could not derive themselves from Roderic, and if he had issue, then Cadelh could not have Powys by inheritance, as being the eldest of the three brethren; what was got otherwise, is not the thing in question. And truly to deny Mervyn's issue were injury in the highest degree offered to diverse gentlemen of Wales descending from him, and in particular to the reverend and learned judge, Sir William Jones of Carnarvonshire, Kt. and lately one of the Justices of the King's Bench, who derives his pedegree lineally from Trillin the son of Mervyn: and if you doubt whether Mervyn had such a son, a very ancient parchment MS. written above 400 yeares agoe will resolve you, O Driffin mob Mervyn mob Rodri Mawr ydd henyw givehelyeith Riiv o Leyn: that is, the inheritors of Rhiw in Lleyn are descended of Triffin the son of Mervyn, the son of Roderic the Great. Likewise in a genealogy of the Princes of North Wales, South Wales, and Powys descending from Roderic the Great, annexed to a Latine copy of the lawes of Howel Dha, we find that Idwal Voel, son to Anarawd King of North Wales, did marry Avandreg the daughter of Mervyn King of Powys, upon whom he begat Meuric the ancestor of Llewelyn the Great, Prince of North Wales. But the ancient and learned Giraldus Cambrensis, in the relation of the genealogy of the said Llewelyn the Great, hath not only himself fallen into an error, but hath drawn many learned and"], [31, "13 grave antiquaries that followed his tract into the same snare; for speaking of this Avandreg, he saith she was the son and not the daughter of Mervyn (the which Mervyn against all antiquity and truth he calleth Prince of North Wales) and so ascendeth to Roderic the Great by the feminine line, making no mention at all of Idwal Voel the son of Anarawd Prince of North Wales indeed, whom ancient writers term and stile by the name of Iudwallus Rex omnium Wallensium, who also, as is said before, upon this Avandreg the daughter (and not the son) of Mervyn King of Powys, begat the forenamed Meuric, the ancestor of Leoline the Great.

Hereby it is manifest that the soveraignty of Powys did not belong to the Prince of South Wales; for if it had, questionlesse the Lord Rees then present would have challenged the same as his right by inheritance: and that it did of right appertain to the Prince of North Wales may farther ap-"], [33, "15 pear by an ancient Inquisition taken at Bala before Humphrey Duke of Glocester, An. 6.

Dom. 617, and this Cadelh whom you will have to be his son, died An. Dom. 808, as Caradoc of Lan- earvan affirmeth; so then, that one, or yet both of them should raigne very near 200 yeares is almost impossible, and altogether untrue: for according to the ancient histories of Wales, Cadelh was the son of Elisseu, the son of Cynllaw, the son of Beli, the son of Maelmynan, the son of Selyf or Salomon, the son of Cynan, the son of Brochwel Ysgythroc, King of Powys, and Earle of Chester. Thus you see your"], [34, "16 first argument and reason for Cadelh's seniority and soveraignty quite overthrown: first, by the testimony of Camden, declaring that the latter Princes of Powys (the issue of Cadelh) were descended from the third son of Roderic the Great, which degree of birth the authors above mentioned ascribe unto Cadelh by name. Secondly, by an un doubted proof of Mervyn's issue. And lastly, by the soveraignty over Powys proved to be in the Princes of North Wales; all which infal libly conclude them to be descended from the eldest son of Roderic: the Great."], [35, "17 THE SECOND ARGUMENT. That South Wales, which was the portion of Cadelh, was far larger than any of the two other, almost double in quantity, containing 38 Cantreds, and 80 Commots; whereas both North Wales and Powys contained but 29 Cantreds and 78 Commots : and yet the Cantred of Buelht and the Forest of Dean are admitted in that division to be in Powys, which were part of South Wales, and assigned to Cadelh. South Wales also was far better soile generally, and most replenished with noblemen and gentry. Therefore it was the fittesl portion to be assigned to the eldest and soveraigne, and unfit for a younger brother upon evident ground of reason. THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND ARGUMENT. To find out the true proportion of Cadelh's inheritance, your coun tryman Jo. Asser Menevensis, that lived in Cadelh's time, will with most approved authority direct us : Rio enim tempore fy multo ante ovi nes regiones dextralis Britanni\u00e6 partis, ad Elfred regem perlinebant, fy adhuc pertinent. Hemeid scilicet, cum omnibus habilatoribus Demetic\u00e6 regionis, fy sexfiliorum Rotri vi compulsus regali se subdiderat imperio,"], [36, "18 Hovil quoq; filius Ris rex Gleguising fy Brochmail atque Feruail filii Meuric, reges Gwent vi fy tyrannide Eadred comitis fy Merciorum com pulsi suapte eundem expetivere regem, ut dominium fy defensionem ab eo pro inimicis suis haberent. Helised quoq ; filius Teudyr, rex Brechoni\u0153 eorundem filiorum Rotri vi coactus, dominium regis pr\u0153fati suapte re quisivit.d Hereby it appeares that Dyved (now called Pembrokeshire) Brecknock, Gwent, and Glewising, had their severall Kings in Cadelh's time, so that of a certainty his portion cannot exceed the two counties of Cardigan and Carmardhen, of old called the Kingdome of Cardigan, which countrey being then the possession and kingdome of Cadelh, who was not yet in league with King Alfred, Asserius mentioneth not. And Rees ap Theodor (the most powerful Prince as you say, since Roderic the Great's time) had no more in his possession than those two counties, as Sir Edward Stradling in the conquest of Glamorgan makes good, all which containing scarce 9 Cantreds may seem far inferior in quantity to North Wales, which in the daies of Howell Dha contained 18 Cantreds, as Morgeneu Ynad and Kyvnerth his son do averre in their Book of British Lawes.\" Neither will it availe you though you proved that Cadelh's soveraignty as chief Prince of South Wales did extend to all the inferior Princes within South Wales; for so likewise did the soveraignty of Anarawd conclude Cadelh and all Wales in generall, as owing homage to him the first of their line, by the ordi nance of Roderic the Great, mentioned in the Description of Cambria, by Sir J. Price, and confirmed also by the Laues of Howel Dha.

And yet it had another inconvenience worse than all the rest, by reason whereof it was reputed even in those daies to be far worse than North Wales, though it were greater in quantity, and that is this: South Wallia (saith Giraldus) quanquam quantitale longe major, propter nobiles tamen qui Uchelwyr quasi superiorcs viri vocantur, quibus abuudabat, qui fy dominis rebelles esse solebant, doininumque J'erro detrec tabant, deterior esse videbatur.k Is it likely then that Roderic the Great would prefer his eldest son and soveraigne prince of the Britaines to a kingdome that did not only want naturall fortifications, but had also the unhappinesse of having inhabitants, whose condition and privi. ledges disposed them to rebellion. But if our opinions in this case be conceived not authentick, as proceeding from prejudice, Mr. Camden an indifferent person may be thought fit to decide the controversie. And to say no more to this argument, let your own countryman Giral dus his fore-mentioned Incomparabiliter prevaile upon you to be of another judgment."], [39, "21 THE THIRD ARGUMENT. That Howel Dha, the eldest son of Cadelh, and succeeding him Prince of South Wales, did command the Archbishop of St. Davids, and all the Bishops of Wales, and chiefest of the Clergy, to the num ber of 140, and all the Barons and Nobility of Wales, and six of Ihe most wise and best esteemed in every Commot of Wales, for the Com monalty, to assemble at his pallace called y Ty Givyn ar Taf in Dyved in South Wales, where with great solemnity he did ordain the Lawes whereby North Wales and Powys, and all the people throughout the whole dominion of Wales were governed and ordered, untill after the conquering of Rees ap Theodor, that King Henry the first did plant the Common Law of England, first in the Counties of Glamorgan and Pembroke (which were conquered and made Counties from that time) and that the Lords Marchers as they won into Wales did settle a forme of justice mixt of the Common Law and of the Lawes of Howel Dha, yet so distempered (as justly may be said) with regal jurisdiction per mitted for the time by the King of England, that in the end it became as intolerable to the crown as to the people, which Lawes of Howel Dha were neverthelesse entirely executed within so much of the Prin- cipality of North Wales as continued in the four ancient Counties C"], [40, "22 there, viz. Anglesea, Carnarvon, Merioneth, and Flint, and in the Counties of Carmarthen and Cardigan in South Wales, untill the sub duing of Llewelyn ap Griffith, the last Prince of North Wales, that King Edward the first ordained the statute of Ruthlan for justice to be done in these six last recited Counties (wherein all the Principality of Wales then remained) howbeit many of the Lawes of Howel Dha continued in force as well in those Counties as in the Lordships Marchers, untill the Statute of Wales, in 27 Hen. VIII, even as some few do continue to this day under the title of Customes. Upon all which it is also concluded, that to give or ordain lawes, and with these muniments of authority, proveth without question a soveraignty. THE ANSWER. Howel Dha, Prince of South Wales, by reason of the incapacity (as you say in your 5th Argument) of the heir apparent of North Wales, took upon him the rule and government of all Wales. Which being true, it is not to be marvelled at, if he commanded the Clergy and Nobility of all Wales to assemble before him, that by their coun sell and advice he might reforme the ancient lawes of the Brittaines: nor yet if the succeeding Princes of North Wales, finding those lawes good, wholsome, and confirmed by the see apostolick, and also such as"], [41, "23 did not abrogate but confirme their soveraignty over all Wales, em braced them, and commanded their subjects to obey them duly, consi dering that his said authority was grounded upon his Regency over North Wales, and the heir thereof, as manifestly appeares when Howel Dha in his said lawes saith, that verbum regis Aberffraw est verbum super omnes reges Walli\u00e6, fy nullius verbum est super ipsum.1 So that whereas you would derive a soveraignty to Howel Dha from his power in making lawes, you should first have suppressed or burnt all the copies of the Lawes of Howel Dha, which gave to the King of North Wales an absolute soveraignty over all Wales."], [42, "24 THE FOURTH ARGUMENT. That the Bishops of North Wales were created and consecrated in South Wales by the Archbishop of St. David's, that they were his suffragans, and subject to his see. And therefore Roderic in the divi sion, did aptly dispose the soveraign jurisdiction temporall in the ter ritory where the soveraign jurisdiction spirituall was seated, which otherwise had been absurd, and would undoubtedly have bred great troubles. THE ANSWER. In regard the soveraignty of the eldest son of Roderic extended over all Wales, it is not materiall in what part thereof the ecclesiastical su premacy be seated : for be it in the territory of the third or second brother, it cannot prejudice the eldest that is soveraign over all. Your argument, did I hold it firme, would perswade with me to make Edl stan the youngest son of Egbert, to have a soveraignty over his eldest brother Ethelwolph, as being King of Kent, wherein is seated Canter bury, the chiefest see for spirituall jurisdiction: or well might I gather that the King of Dyved, in whose kingdome St. David's lay, was su perior to Cadelh and his successors, by reason of his good neighbour hood with the Archbishop."], [43, "25 THE FIFTH ARGUMENT. That the Prince of South Wales did seize the Principality of North Wales, and removed the Princes thereof upon occasion, or offence committed, as the said Howel Dha did seize the same, partly by the incapacity of Meuric son of Idwal Voel, to govern and to stay the usurpation of others (upon that pretence) whereby to preserve the ge neral peace of Wales : and partly by forfeiture, for spoile that had been done by the Prince of North Wales upon his countries of Cardigan and Ystradgwy. This Prince Howel, as the writers of North Wales do record, was of a goodly behaviour, just and discreet in his government, and beloved of men ; wherefore he obtained the attribute of Dha, which is in English the Good, whereby it is to be concluded probably, that his coming to the Principality of Wales was upon just and lawfull grounds. Likewise Owen ap Howel Dha his son, Prince of South Wales, did seize North Wales out of the hands of Cadwalhon ap Ieuaf, for usurpation and tyranny, and made Meredith his third son Prince there, which, if it had been the soveraign seat, he would not have permitted his younger son to enjoy it, and to become thereby his supe riour. And in this point the writers of North Wales do obscure the truth with some art by concealing this to be done by the power of the father (Prince of South Wales) and attributing the same wholly to the"], [44, "26 power of a third son; whereas it is evident, that he had neither force nor authority to perform it, but as his father's minister and subject, whom his father thought good to honour with the fruit of his valour and victory, being atchieved proprid manu not proprio marte, more than the con quests of the famous Prince Edward, called the Black Prince, whose everlasting honours they are, but the possessory right of them was to his father's crown. And it is to be observed, that as the division of Wales by Roderic the Great did give the ground of the subduing thereof to the crown of England, so it bred these preparatives thereunto; first the continuall usurpation of the descendants of Anarawd upon his lawfull heirs, insomuch as for 200 yeares after the division, five of that line did intermissively usurp the government of North Wales, and only two lawfull princes ruled there, and those not past 12 yeares, if they be allowed to be the issue of Anarawd, which some writers of North Wales do gainsay: in which licentious times one \u00c6dan ap Blegored, a meer private man, neither of the blood of the Prince, nor of the nobility, that any antiquity doth record, intruded into the government, and held it 12 yeares, untill he was expelled by the Prince of South Wales. Secondly, it gave the Danes and English opportunity to invade and weaken all the parts of Wales (who were often called in by the usurp ers of North Wales to joyn with them against the Prince of South Wales.) By those occasions, the Princes of South Wales, as supreme Lords of Wales, and for the generall quiet and preservation thereof. did seize and assume into their hands the government of North Wales,"], [45, "27 wherein six of them ruled the said 200 yeares, which had not they done, the government in all likelihood had been in that time translated from the race of Roderic the Great. But in the end of those 200 yeares, Rees ap Theodor, Prince of South Wales, with great valour and wisdome did overcome all these long grown evils, and being the most powerfull prince that was since Roderic the Great, and lineal heir to Cadelh, expelled Trahern ap Caradoc, the last usurper of North Wales, and placed Griffith ap Conan (who was held to be the lawfull prince of the house of Anarawd) in the quiet and settled possession thereof: which honourable dealing was very ill requited by Griffith ap Conan towards the son of Rees ap Theodor in his distresse, as shall be after declared. By all which may appear the generall care of the Princes of South Wales over the whole dominion of Wales derived from their supreme power, authority, and jurisdiction. For confirma tion hereof, it is further to be observed, that sithence the said division, no prince of North Wales did ever rule in South Wales, or by any oc casion did make claime to the Principality thereof: and therefore upon this disposing of the Principality of North Wales by the Princes of South Wales, it is further concluded, that the Princes of South Wales were the soveraign Princes of Wales."], [46, "28 THE ANSWER. It is recorded by Caradocus, that Anarawd, King of North Wales, made a road into the country of Cardigan and Ystradtywi, the posses sion of his brother Cadelh, but being that the author alleageth not the cause thereof, as whether it were lawfull or unlawfull, it might with better reason be said, that it was made for the defect of payment of the tribute due to the crown of Aberffraw from South Wales, than such a rebellion, as thereby forfeiture of royalty should ensue: and consider ing also that no chastisement was executed by Cadelh or Howel Dha his son upon Anarawd, who lived long after, it may seem great rigor and tyranny in him, and much to derogate from his title of Dha, that is, the Good, if he did deprive Idwal's son of his inheritance for the offence of Anarawd his grandfather, committed many yeares before his birth, not upon the countries of Howel, as you say, but of Cadelh his father. Therefore if you hold his coming to North Wales to be upon good and lawfull grounds, it will be your best course (rejecting offences and forfeitures) wholly to stick to the incapacity of the heir of North Wales, by reason whereof Howel's coming to North Wales, whether it were as being next of blood, able, and worthy to undertake such a charge, or by the appointment of his cousen Idwal, foreseeing perhaps the weaknesse of his son, or else by the election of the people, was good, just, and lawfull, And in regard of his said regency over the"], [47, "29 house of North Wales, and the right thereunto belongiug, I do con fesse that he was the soveraign Prince of all Wales. But considering, that after his death the other sons of Idwal Voel, and their successors the Princes of North Wales recovered and held (as I said before) as well the soveraignty of all Wales, as the rule of North Wales, it plainly appears that the right of soveraignty belonged not to South Wales. Moreover, Owen the son of Howel Dha was never ruler of North Wales, nor had any action against Cadwalhon ap Ieuaf, whereby to deprive him of his crown and kingdome, as you say ; neither is it likely, if he had so conquered him, that he would preferre his youngest son to the government of that kingdome, lest by exalting the younger brother to honours and dignities above the elder, discord and sedition might breed between them : and in a word, your own countryman Caradocus, that lived about 250 years after this time, attributeth the overthrow of Cadwalhon ap Ieuaf, and conquest of North Wales, to the only power of Meredith ap Owen (who then in his mother's right did rule all Powys land, whereby his power to undertake that voyage may plainly appear) in these words : Mredyth ap Oivein a lathawdh Cadwallawn ap Ieuaf dr ivy fuddugoliaeth, a chaffael meddiant (si gyfoeth, sef Gwyneth a Man a ddarostyngawdh iddaw: that is, Meredith ap Owen slew Cad walhon ap Ieuaf in battell, and seized on his dominions, for North Wales and the Isle of Anglesea submitted to him. Here is no mention had of Owen or his power, and therefore our writers of North Wales being only interpreters of your Caradocus, are free from that scandalous D"], [48, "30 imputation that you charge them with. And Lhewelyn ap Seissyllt, Prince of South Wales, who overcame \u00c6dan ap Blegored, did not challenge the regency of North Wales (for Iago the son of Idwal, the lawfull heir, as is thought, was not as yet in full age) as appertaining any way to the crowu of South Wales, as you could wish it, but as he was next heir of blood unto the said Iago, for as Caradocus saith, he was descended from the Kings of Wales by the mother side, whose name was Trawst, the daughter and heir of Elissau, the second son of Anarawd the eldest son of Roderic the Great, and by that meanes, ac cording to the same author, he claimed and enjoyed the right of North Wales ; therefore his coming to the rule of that kingdome doth not at all favour or confirme your argument. And here I do greatly marvel who those six kings of South Wales were, that (as you say) assumed to their hands the government of North Wales, for Meredith ap Owen was neither king nor heir apparent of South Wales, when he conquered North Wales : and Howel ap Edwyn was King of South Wales when Griffith ap Lhewelyn undertook the rule of North Wales; and in like manner Meredith ap Owen ap Edwyn governed South Wales, when Bledhyn ap Cynvyn received the Principality of North Wales at the hands of the King of England, doing homage for the same, whereby it is evident that these three princes were not of the six that you mention, and Howel Dha, with Lhewelyn ap Seissyllt, though they were most worthy and noble Princes, yet cannot exceed the number of two, therefore the number of six must needs be a mistake. It is also to be"], [49, "31 observed, that these princes Meredith, Griffith, Bledhyn, and Trahay arn ap Caradoc, after they had settled themselves in the sure and quiet possession of North Wales, seized to their hands the kingdome of South Wales, and held the same either by strong hand and usurpation, or by state of inheritance, or else in the right of soveraignty over all Wales that belonged to the crown of North Wales. Usurpers they were not, if it be true, that as you say (in the end of your treatise) South Wales did never faile of a lawfull prince to govern it, till the period thereof by the fatall overthrow of Prince Rees ap Theodor: lawfull heires also to Cadelh they cannot be, for the posterity of Einion the son of Owen King of South Wales, and eldest brother to the said Meredith, were living, and therefore they could not challenge South Wales by inheritance; it remaines then of necessity that their title to South Wales was grounded on the soveraignty that belonged to the King of North Wales, whereof they were Princes. But howsoever the matter went, it is certaine that they were Kings of North Wales, and being so, they took into their hands the regiment of South Wales; whereby I do conclude it was a grosse error in you, when you say, that no Prince of North Wales did ever rule in South Wales, or by any oc casion did claime the Principality thereof: seeing the examples of four Princes must cause you to confesse either your ignorance or partiall censure. Lastly, you say that Rees ap Theodor, Prince of South Wales, with great valor and wisdome did expell Trahern ap Caradoc, the last usurper of North Wales, and placed Griffith ap Conan in the"], [50, "32 quiet possession thereof: but antiquity and the truth will informe us otherwise; for in the life of Griffith ap Conan we may read, that when the said Griffith with his navy landed at Portcleis, near St. David's, your powerfull Prince Rees had been a little before deprived of his kingdome by Trahayarn King of North Wales, and others, and for safegard of his life had covertly taken sanctuary at St. David's: but hearing of Griffith's approach, he came with the Bishop and all the Clergy of that house to meet him, where Rees fell upon his knees be fore Griffith, and acquainting him with his ill fortunes, desired his help and aid to fight with those of his adversaries, promising to do him homage, and to reward him with the moiety of his revenues : and Griffith, pitying his estate, yielded to his request; and having over thrown in battell his enemies, he installed Rees in the quiet possession of South Wales, entred and destroyed Powys with fire and sword, and recovered the kingdome of North Wales his due inheritance : here wit hall I find an entry made to Powys by a Prince of North Wales before the fatall overthrow of Rees ap Theodor, which you deny in your first argument."], [51, "33 THE SIXTH ARGUMENT. That the Kings of England did ground their title to the Principa lity and soveraignty of Wales upon the conquering of Rees ap Theodor Prince of Wales, in the raign of Rufus, and not upon the subduing of Lhewelyn ap Griffith in the raign of Edward the First, as the writers of North Wales do alledge: for from the conquering of Rees ap The odor all the withstanding of the power of the Kings of England in Wales was termed by them rebellion and treason, which before always had the name of war. And thenceforth the Kings of England did give seigniories and possessions in Wales to their English subjects, and so the Lords Marchers began: and thenceforth were the strong castles and forts erected, and garrisons planted in all parts of Wales, wherein either the Kings of England, or the Lords Marchers did set footing, which grounded in the Kings of England a resolution to pro secute and accomplish the absolute conquest of Wales. And thereby the Bishoprick of St. David's, and by that See all the rest of the Bi shopricks of Wales were brought under the jurisdiction of Canterbury. And thereupon Griffith ap Conan, and the rest of the Princes of North Wales succeeding, yielded to the Kings of England submission for that Principality, and to hold the same of the crown of England, and gave them pledges to abide in their peace. And the Kings of"], [52, "34 England were stayed from the absolute conquest of North Wales, chiefly by their unsettled state in England, being full of troubles, especially by the French and Barons wars, which were no sooner ended, but that King Henry the Third, and his son Edward the First, took North Wales from Lhewelyn the last, yet adding thereby no more to his former possession of the Principality of Wales (as the Statute of Ruthlan doth shew) but Terram de Snowdon, and accounting Lhewelyn not an enemie, but a rebell, as appeared by fixing his head on the highest turret of the Tower of London, and executing his brother David for treason; whereas the English did deliver the slain body of Rees ap Theodor to a decent and honourable buriall in the Abbey of Ystradflwr. THE ANSWER. Although the Kings of England after the overthrow of Rees ap Theodor did terme the withstanding of their power iu Wales rebellion and treason, it cannot be conceived that should be a sufficient ground for their title to the Principality of Wales: for what are those termes, but the hard censure of their utter and always professed enemies in their greatest anger and indignation, peradventure after some shamefull overthrow and losse received, and therefore not much to be regarded."], [53, "35 But it cannot be granted they gave such names to those wars ; for the wars between King John (with his successors the Kings of England) and Lhewelyn the Great, David his son, Owen Goch, and Lhewelyn ap Griffith, Princes of Wales, are always termed Guerr\u00e6, as it appears in the submissions of David ap Lhewelyn, An. Dom. 1240 & 1241, of Owen Goch and Lhewelyn, An. Dom the adward of Ottobonus the Pope's Legate, An. Dom. 1268, and the agreement between Ed- ward the First and the said Lhewelyn Prince of Wales, An. Dom. 1277, do likewise call those wars Guerr\u00e6, which doth not in any au- thor signifie Rebellion, as must needs be acknowledged. Now that the Kings of England thenceforth did give seigniories and possessions in Wales to their subjects, who did erect strong forts and castles there- in, it is confessed, as touching some part of the inheritance of Rees ap Theodor; and it is also true, that before and after the death of Rees ap Theodor, the Kings of England did vex and molest Griffith ap Conan (as the author of his life averreth) and his successors the Princes of Wales, sometimes by craft and deceit, and sometimes with unjust wars ; insomuch that to purchase their peace and quietnesse, and not otherwise, the Princes were often content to yield up unto the Kings of England four Cantreds. This with other hard dealings hath been noted by diverse writers, and Henry the Second did not stick to con- fesse the same, when he said, as Giraldus affirmeth, Per vires nostras magnas injuriam fy violentiam irrogemus Cambris, to which force and violence, and not to any new soveraignty gotten by the overthrow of"], [54, "36 Rees ap Theodor must be attributed what submission or acknowledg ment of soveraignty that Griffith ap Conan and his successors the Princes of Wales did to the Kings of England, if any was demanded or performed over and above the wonted and usuall. It is also manifest, that the Archbishop of Canterbury did obtain a supremacy over the Bishops of Wales shortly after the overthrow of Rees ap Theodor, yet. not by reason of this said overthrow, but of the suggestion of false wit nesses before Pope Eugenius in the Remensian Councell, whose apos tolicall decrees all the churches in Europe obeyed in those dayes. Moreover you urge out of the Statute of Ruthlan, that King Edward the First added no more to his former possessions of the Principality of Wales by the conquest of Leoline, but only Terrain de Snoivdon; whereas it doth not so appear in any copy of the said Statute that ever I could find, and yet I have seen diverse in Wales anciently written on parchment, both in the Latine and Brittish tongues. As concerning the dishonour done to the Prince after his death, by fixing his head on the highest turret of the Tower of London, examples of this kind of dealing with princes we have frequent in histories: Tigranes King of the Armenians, who lived under Tiberius C\u00e6sar, could not with all his kingly titles, as Tacitus sayth, escape the common death of a Roman. Tacitus speaks also in the Second Book of his Annals, of Artavasdes King of Armenia, whom Antonius having by treachery got into his power, loaded with chaines, and afterwards put to death. Cyrus, that great monarch of the Persians, who being overthrown and slain by"], [55, "37 Tomyris Queen of the Scythians, had his head cut off, and in great contempt and derision flung into a vessell full of man's blood. Pto lomy Ceraunus, King of Macedon, was in battell vanquished and slaine by Belius (a Britton as some are of opinion) who caused his head to be cut off, and carried before him on the point of a spear round about the field, in token of victory and triumph. There be many the like ex amples in histories of Kings and Emperors, whose bodies have been coarsely handled by their enemies, who de facto use them so, as being in their power, though de jure they ought not to deale so with lawfull princes. And here I may not passe over how that the Abbey of Ystrad flwr, where you say that the body of Rees ap Theodor was decently buried, was not founded before the dayes of the Lo. Rees ap Griffith ap Rees ap Theodor, Prince of South Wales, as appeares by his Char ter made presently after the foundation : Ego Rhesus Soutliwalli\u00e6 proprietaries princeps venerabile Monasterium vocabulo Stradfiur \u00e6difi care c\u0153pi, fy \u00e6dificatum dilexi fy feci, res ejus auxi, fy possessiones in quantum suffragante Deo volui, amplam fy omnem donationem quum eidem monasterio antea contuli, Anno iterum ab Incarnatione Domini, 1184, scilicet pr\u00e6sentis scripti memor-id stabilivi, tres etiamfilii scilicet Gruff. Rhesus, fy Meredith eandem donationem eodem tempore fy loco in manu Abbatis de Stratfiur obtulerunt.\"1 And in the year of our Lord 1164 (just 20 yeares before the date of the former Charter) as witness ed! the Book of Conway, it was first covented. Rees ap Theodor was slain An. Dom. 1091, whereby it appeares that your Abbey was not E"], [56, "38 founded 73 yeares after his death. It remaines now that I speak some what of the true and undoubted conquest of Wales atchieved by Ed ward the First, as it appeares by the power that he assumed over all the inhabitants of Wales, after the fatal overthrow of Leoline the last prince of the British blood ; for of all the Kings of England he was the first that altered the forme of government in Wales, he was the first that made the Statute of Ruthlan as a law to govern the people of that country by; he also created Edward of Carnarvon, his eldest son, Prince of Wales, who according to Mr. Camden, and diverse more an cient writers, Erat primus ex Anglico sanguine Walli\u00e6 princeps. Hereby it appears that W. Rufus was not the conqueror of Wales, nor Rees ap Theodor the soveraigne Prince of Wales ; for if Rees had been the superior Prince, King W. Rufus, having learned of his father the lesson of a conqueror, would in no case have omitted to accomplish those rites of a conqueror. Neither did the Kings of England chal lenge the Principality of Wales by the conquest of W. Rufus, but by the atchievement of Edward the First, as it appears first of all by the words of the Statute of Ruthlan : Divina Providentia (saith Edward I .) qu\u00e6 in sui dispositione nonfallitur, inter alia su\u00e6 dispensations munera, quibus nos fy regnum nostrum Angli\u00e6 decorari dignata est, terram Wal li\u00e6 cum incolis suis prius nobis jure feod\u00e6li subjectam jam sui gratia in proprietatis nostr\u00e6 dominium obstaculis quibuscunque cessantibus totali ter fy cum integritate convertit, fy coron\u00e6 regni pr\u00e6dicti tanquam par tern corporis ejusdem annexuit fy univit.\" Henry the Fourth gives the title"], [57, "39 of Conqueror of Wales to Edward the First in his lawes against the Welshmen, made An. 2, Henry IV. thus, Nulle Gallois ait Chastel, Fortresse ne maison defensive de son propre, ne de autre agardere, autre ment que nescoit usez en temps le Roy Ed. Conquerer de Galez: that is, No Welshman shall have castle, fortresse, nor house defensive of his own, nor of other to keep, otherwise than was used in the time of King Edward, Conqueror of Wales. The title of those Petitions made at Kenynton do averre the same : Peticones de Kenynton fact\u00e6 apud Ke nynton per homines Northivalli\u00e6 tarn pro communitatibus comitatuum quam pro singularibus personis exhibit\u00e6 domino principi filio regis Ed.

After this conquest of Wales by the overthrow of Rees ap Theodor, and the expulsion of his son Griffith ap Rees, who was forced to fly to Ireland, Griffith ap Conan being then Prince of North Wales, and of greatest power of any prince there, sithence the said division, never stirred for the Principality of South Wales; which, if he had been the supreme Prince of Wales, by this occasion he should most properly and justly have done, neither did any of the Princes of North Wales succeeding him, to the last Prince Lhewelyn ap Griffith, make claime thereunto : albeit they were all of them, one after the other, the most powerfull, worthy, and fortunate princes that had ruled in North Wales since the division, as Owen Gwyneth, David ap Owen, Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth, David ap Lhewelyn, and that they had the advantage in their times of the alteration of seven Kings of England, and a troubled state there to have attempted it. But Griffith ap Rees returning from Ireland (to recover his patrimony) in the weaknesse of his fortunes retired to Griffith ap Conan then Prince of North Wales, whose daugh ter he had married, and had by her worthy sons. Of whose return and purpose Henry the First, then King of England, understanding, know ing him to be the undoubted heir of Wales, and that he would be re ceived by the people, sent for the Prince of North Wales, and drew"], [59, "41 him in, to yield to the delivery of Griffith ap Rees into his hands, which the Prince attempted, and had effected accordingly, but that Griffith ap Rees (upon some notice thereof) hardly escaped into the sanctuary of Aberdaron, whence the Prince would have forced him, but that he was rescued by the whole Clergy of the countrey, and thence conveyed to South Wales; whereupon it is evident, that if Griffith ap Conan had been soveraign Prince of Wales (de jure) first no necessity compelling him, he would not have been so undiscreet as to have put himself into the King of England's hands (who claimed the soveraignty thereof) neither would the King have suffered him to depart, seeing by detaining him he might more easily have compassed his end. Secondly, the Prince of North Wales would not have been so injurious to himself as to have delivered Griffith ap Rees (if he had been his homager of South Wales) whereby to divest him self of his right thereunto by his own act. But it is plaine that the Prince of North Wales in respect of the conquering of Rees ap The odor, having submitted himself to the King of England (as his ho mager) and to his peace, came to the King at his sending for him, knowing well that the King was carelesse of him as touching the right of soveraignty of Wales. And so he yielded (to make his peace the firmer with the King) to the betraying of his superior, of his guest and son in law, and the son of him who got him the possession of the Prin cipality of North Wales. Hereupon Griffith ap Rees put himselfe in armes, and so held himself during King Henry's time, and a part of"], [60, "42 King Stephen's, recovering a great part of South Wales, and died, leaving his troubles and possessions to his son, called the Lord Rees, who in the end made peace with King Henry the Second, and sur rendred to him his title to the Principality of Wales, bringing the chiefest of the Nobility and Gentry of South Wales to Glocester, where they submitted themselves to the King, and received their lands and possessions by the King's grant, to hold of him. And the Lord Rees accepted of the King to be his Justice of South Wales, which office continued untill 27th of King Henry the Eighth, and ended in the Lord Ferrers of Chartley. THE ANSWER. For answer hereunto, you must first conceive that Griffith ap Conan at the time of Rees ap Theodor's death, was not so powerfull as you make him to be : for as we read in the author of his life, he was then but newly escaped out of the Earl of Chester's prison, where he had remained 12 yeares. Secondly, that notwithstanding his unsettled state in North Wales (by reason of his said imprisonment) and the King of England's displeasure conceived against him, he joyned forces with Cadwgan ap Bledhyn his son in law, and entring South Wales, after they had slaine in battell a great number of Normans, a great part"], [61, "43 thereof, though not all, became subject to Cadwgan, as the British history of the Princes relateth ; wherein also we find, that afterwards Griffith ap Conan sent his sons Owen and Cadwaladr twice to South Wales, being one time accompanied with 6000 footmen, and 2000 horsemen, they took the castles of Walter Espec and Richard de la Mare, and also the castles of Aberystwyth, Dinerth, and Caerwedros, subduing the whole countrey to the town of Cardigan ; and after the slaughter of 3000 Normans in the field, they chased the rest out of the countrey, restoring Griffith ap Rees to his father's inheritance, and the ancient inhabitants to their former dwellings ; which is sufficient evi- dence that they made claime to South Wales as soveraign Princes. And Griffith ap Conan cannot be imagined to interest himselfe in the cause (especially in his weaknesse) by sending his subjects to the field, but that he challenged the soveraignty thereof as due by inheritance, and his son Owen Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales, would not have entred South Wales, in the first year of his reign, as the Chronicle witnesseth, overthrowing the Castles of Ystratmeuric, Stephens, and Hwmphreys, and burning the town of Carmarthen, and compelling part of Dyved to pay tribute unto him (as Gwalchmai ap Meilir that lived in that age hath recorded) retaining most of Cardigan in his own hands, without claime or pretence of title. Likewise when Henry the Second, King of England, made his third expedition against Wales, the Lord Rees and the power of South Wales, and all the other Lords of Wales, with their forces marched against the King under the conduct"], [62, "44 of the Prince of North Wales, which directly proveth his soveraignty over all Wales. After these tumults and turmoils, Lhewelyn ap Ior werth, Prince of North Wales, to prevent all doubt that might arise concerning his right, made all South Wales and Powys swear fealty unto him, as the Book of Conway makes good, wherein we read that they acknowledged the like fealty to David his son, and Lhewelyn the last prince. But as concerning the unkind dealing of Griffith ap Co nan with Griffith ap Rees, and Griffith ap Conan's going to the King of England, I cannot see how that deserves an answer as an argument for the soveraignty in the Princes of South Wales. Lastly, you affirme that the Lord Rees surrendred his title to the Principality of Wales to the King of England : which seems unto me most improbable, consi dering he would not voluntarily depose himself of such royall prehemi nence and soveraignty, without he were brought to such extremity that there were no other remedy; whereas it is evident that the Lord Rees was in great favour with King Henry the Second at the time you men tion, and had been for many years before; witnesse the office of being- Justice of South Wales, which the King had given him three years before that peace at Glocester, as the Book of Conway mentioneth : then also that he brought to the King's peace at Glocester no Lords of North Wales or Powys, but few of South Wales, such as had for merly offended the King; whereby it appears that his said resignation, if there were any such, extended no farther than his title of South Wales only, and yet in regard that all the English writers do terme"], [63, "45 and stile the said Lord Rees King of South Wales, even to the last pe riod of his life, I cannot readily believe that there was any such surren der made, untill the same do appear by some authentick record. THE EIGHTH ARGUMENT. That the Princes of North Wales (though some late writers of those parts call them Princes and Kings of Wales) did not write themselves so, nor were taken to be so in their time, when there was fit occasion to set forth their title. But ever since the conquering of Rees ap The- dor they did acknowledge this title from the Kings of England, as may appear by the said submissions and transactions between the Kings of England and the Princes of North Wales, from the death of Rees ap Theodor to the death of Lhewelyn the last Prince, even as they are related by the writers of North Wales. And which maketh it more evident, when the Pope did absolve Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth from his oath of obedience made to King John, and David ap Lhewelyn from his oath of obedience made to King Henry the Third, he gave them the title of Princes of North Wales only; whereas both the Princes would have sought, and the Pope would have yielded them the title of Princes of Wales (in that case especially for the larger extent of their absolutions) if there had been ground for it. Likewise it appeareth by the excommunication of Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth, when as he persisted F"], [64, "46 in action against King John, after the Pope had made his end with the King, that the Pope stiled him Prince of North Wales only: and the colour that those writers do take to terme them of North Wales Princes of Wales was, for that after the subduing of Rees ap Theodor, the people of Wales had no other in their distresses to resort unto for pro tection but the Princes of North Wales. And in that respect, and not otherwise, there being then no Princes of South Wales, Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth, Prince of North Wales, being incited by the Pope and Barons against King John, did assume a command in most parts of Wales; but it ceased in a short time, and he submitted himselfe and his country to King Henry the Third. THE ANSWER. It is certain, that the Princes of North Wales, howsoever they did lay down their titles, were always reputed and taken to be the soveraign Kings of the Britaines and Princes of Wales, for Caradoc Lancarvan in Glamorganshire, speaking of Anarawd Prince of North Wales, gives him the title and honour of King of the Britaines, and chief King of Wales, as is manifest in the ancient copies of his history. Idwal Voel his son is called by William Malmesbury and others, Rex omnium Wal lensium. The same stile, or the like in effect, Caradocus attributeth"], [65, "47 unto the sons of Idwal, Howel ap Ieuaf, Meredith ap Owen, and Bleddyn ap Cynvyn, Princes of North Wales. Trahayarn ap Caradoc is called King of Wales by George Owen Harry. Griffith ap Conan, whom Mr. Camden calleth Princeps Walli\u00e6, was acknowledged by Rees ap Theodor himself to be Brenhin Brenhinoedd Cymru, that is, King of the Kings of Wales, as the author of Griffith's life averreth ; whereby it clearly appears, that the said Rees Prince of South Wales pretended no right to the soveraignty of Wales. And Caradocus also saith, that Griffith ap Conan, Prince of North Wales, was penna bren hin ac amddiffynwr a thangnefeddwr Cymru oil: that is, the chiefest king, defender, and peace-maker of all Wales. Leoline the Great is also by Mathew Paris, Mat. Westminster, Polidor, and all our British Antiquities, termed Prince of Wales, and sometimes King of Wales, as in an old British ode dedicated to Lhewelyn, by one Eineon Wan, a bard of that age, is extant, wherein he is called Givir Frenhin Cymru, that is, the true or naturall King of Wales. And David Benfras, a bard of great estimation in his time, in the funerall elegy of David Lhewelyn's son, calleth him Mab Brenhin Cymru, that is, the Son of the King of Wales. In like manner Prince David, and Leoline the last, are termed most commonly Princes of Wales by all authors. And here I may not passe how that our great antiquary Mr. Selden, in his notes upon Mi. Draiton his Poliolbion, gives our Princes from Anarawd to the last prince the name and title of Princes of Wales: adding with all, that after the division among Roderic Mawr's sons, the Principa-"], [66, "48 lity was chiefly in North Wales, and the rest as tributaries to the Prince of that part. Seeing therefore that the Princes of North Wales, even from Roderic's time to Lhewelyn ap Griffith, were reputed and taken to be the undoubted Princes and Kings of Wales, I cannot be induced to change my opinion upon bare pretences, be they never so specious. Furthermore it is confessed, that the Princes of North Wales did ac knowledge as well the Principality of Wales, as the title thereof to the Kings of England, yet not only after the death of Rees ap Theodor, but many hundred years before, as it appears by tribute paid by our Princes unto the Kings of England in acknowledgment thereof: for in the dayes of the old Britains, Tair talaith (as we find in an old British manuscript, and in the British Triades) a ddeleid y dala wrth goron Lundain, un yMhenryn Rhionydd yn y Gogledd, a'r ail dalaith yn Aberffraw, ar drydedd yn Gerniiv: that is, Three coronets ought to be held of the crown of London, the one was the crown or coronet of Penrhyn Rhionydd in the North, the second was of Aberffraw, and the third that of Cornwall. And touching the Pope's absolution of Lhe welyn ap Iorwerth from an oath of obedience to the King of England, by stiling him Prince of North Wales, whence you infer that he was not soveraign of any other part, else the Pope would have given it him in his stile, it concerns you, before you make good your conceit herein, to propose unto us the Pope's own words in the originall, and then to shew yourself to be of his counsell, that when he named North Wales the chiefest seat, you might be sure he did thereby intend to take away"], [67, "49 the soveraignty over the rest of Wales. And that North Wales ex ceeded South Wales in respect of supremacy, you may be easily con vinced, if you look back into those times when the Britaines lost the crown and scepter of London (as we find in Prows Ynad,q being an ancient manuscript containing the old laws of the Britaines) : then by a generall assembly of the men of Gwynedh, Powys, Deheubarth, Evas, Morganwc, and Seisyllwc, it was ordained, that Aberffraw in North Wales should be the chiefest seat, and the King thereof the soveraign King of all the British Princes. And King Howel Dha in his Laws mentioneth a tribute due to the King of North Wales from the Kings of South Wales and Powys : whereby, and by the inquisition before specified, it is apparent, that the title of Aberffraw or North Wales in effect is as large, ample, and honourable as the title of all Wales."], [68, "50 THE NINTH ARGUMENT. If King Edward the First of England had not accounted Wales to be his by the conquest of Rees ap Theodor, he might have assumed against Lhewelyn ap Griffith the title of Mortimer his subject in the right of Gwladice his wife, sole sister and heir of David ap Lhewelyn, the last lawfull Prince of North Wales (for Griffith ap Lhewelyn his eldest brother, father to Lhewelyn the last Prince, was base born) : but neither did the King think good to borrow that title, nor did the Mortimers (albeit they were raised to be Earls of March, and becoming the strongest subjects in alliances and kindreds, augmented the same by marrying the sole daughter and heir of the Duke of Clarence, whereby they had after the crown of England) ever claime the Princi pality of Wales; yea though they were in disgrace with the state of England, and were in action against Henry the Fourth, which such mighty persons would hardly have omitted, if the house of North Wales had had good right to the Principality of Wales. Neither would the policy of the state of England have suffered the rising of that house, which by an undoubted right to Wales, might have bereaved them thereof, yet such right as they had is now lawfully vested in the crown by King Edward the Fourth, as heir to Mortimer."], [69, "51 THE ANSWER. It appeareth in the Statute of Ruthlan, that Edward the First did not claime or account the Principality of Wales to be his by the over throw of Rees ap Theodor, for he assumes the glory of the conquest of Wales to himself, as is manifest before in my answer to the Sixth Ar gument, whereunto for your better satisfaction in this point I remit you. And the reason that he borrowed not the title of Mortimer his subject (although it be a thing seldome or never heard of, that the titles of kingdomes should be borrowed or lent) and that his said subject him self did not seize upon the said Principality from Leoline the last, as his right by inheritance, was, because that Mortimer had no right there unto : for Gwlades his wife was the sole sister of Griffith, the eldest son of Lhewelyn the Great, who left behind him diverse children, and not of David, according to your allegation, as by most strong argu ments and ancient authority shall appear, I doubt not, but to your full satisfaction. And first of all, Ralph Lord Mortimer of Wigmore, the husband of Gwlades Dhu, did procure with all his might the deliver ance of Griffith out of his brother David's prison, and also labour for his installment in the Principality of Wales, as is apparent in Mathew Paris, which he would never have done, if his wife had been the sole sister and heir of David; for by the raising of Griffith to the throne of"], [70, "52 Wales, he should not only depose David, but also most indiscreetly exclude himself from being heir apparent to the Principality of Wales, and next to rule after David, who had no issue. Secondly, the Lord Mortimer, after the death of Prince David, made no claime to the Principality, which in no wise he would have omitted, if he had been his heir apparent, and the King of England's nephew, as you pretend, who for the recovery of his right would minister unto him sufficient aid both in men and money. But this neglect infallibly denoteth, that Gwlades with her posterity was not the heir of David, seeing that Leoline held that peaceably with the consent of the King. And in an old book written above 200 years ago, I found the pedegree of Richard Duke of York, father of King Edward the Fourth, wherein the Duke's descent is first brought to the Mortimers by Anne his mother, and from the Mortimers to the Princes of Wales by the said Gwlades, as being sister and heir of Griffith and not of David, even thus: Leolinus suit princeps Walli\u00e6 fy pater Gladys Ddu, h\u00e6res suusfuit Griffimis princeps Walli\u00e6, qui habuit quatuor filios, Leivelinum (ille suit ultimus princeps Walli\u00e6) Oivinum, David, fy Rodri, qui decesserunt sineh\u00e6redibus: ideo revertamur ad Gladys Dim, quam Radulphus Mortimer duxit in uxorem. Lhewelyn was Prince of Wales, and the father of Gladys Dim, his heir was Griffith Prince of Wales, who had four sons, viz. Lhewelyn the last Prince of Wales, Owen, David, and Rodri, who died without heirs ; therefore let us come back again to Gladys Dhu, whom Ralph Mortimer married. Hereby it appeareth that Griffith was Lhewelyn"], [71, "53 ap Iorwerth's son and heir, and therefore born in wedlock, and that his four sons leaving no heirs (as that author saith) the right of the Principality descended to the posterity of Gwladus, which directly proveth she was sister of the whole blood to Griffith, and not to David, of whom the author maketh no mention at all, accounting him and his sisters (some of whose posterity live at this day) no better than bastards. Thirdly, our ancient Books of Pedegrees do with one con sent affirme that the children of Leoline ap Iorwerth were Griffith and Gwladys Dhu, whose mother was Tanglwyst the daughter of Lhowarch Goch of Ros. David Prince of Wales, Gwenlliant, Angharad, and Marvred, whose mother was Joan, the daughter of King John. The White Book of Hergest, a very fair and ancient parchment manuscript, saith, that Prince Lhewelyn wedded one Tanglwyst, the daughter of Lhowarch Lord of Anglesea, and begat by her Griffith and Gwladys Dhu. Gwilym Tew, that flourished in the dayes of Henry VI. hath written that Leoline ap Iorwerth begat Gwladys Dhu upon the daugh ter of Lhowarch Goch, which was the mother of Griffith. And last of all, I find it noted in an old manuscript thus: Lewelinus Gervasii filius princeps Walli\u00e6, primo desponsavit Tanglwyst filiam Lhowarch Vychan, de qua genuit Griffith fy Gwlades Dhu quondam uxorem Radulphi de Mortuomari, post mortem dict\u00e6 Tanglwyst idem Lewelinus desponsavit Joannam filiam Johannis Regis Angli\u00e6, de qua genuit David princi pem, fy Gwenlliant uxorem Jo. Lacie comitis Lincolni\u00e6 fy Angharad primo despoiisata Jo/tanni de Breivys domino de Brechon, post cujus G"], [72, "54 decessum desponsata suit Malgoni Vachan ap Maelgon ap Rees, fy ess eaclem uxore genuit filiam qu\u00e6 maritata est Johanni Scotico comiti Ces tri\u00e6 qui suit nepos Ranulphi comitis Cestri\u00e6 ex parte sororis sui.r Here is (you see) most infallible proof, that Gwladys was not the sole sister and heir of David, but the only sister of Griffith (Lhewelyn the Great his eldest son) who by equity should have succeeded his father in the Principality of Wales; although you and others do averre that he was a bastard, but how truly I appeale to the judgment of impartial anti quaries: for do but equally consider, whether a bastard would offer to disquiet his father and prince, because he intended that his lawfull heir should succeed him in his dominions; or presume to bandy with the legitimate heir for his due inheritance; or whether the King of England would maintaine such an execrable quarrell against his (naturall) ne phew, or the Lords of Wales against their true and legitimate Prince in a bastard's behalf. These circumstances might satisfy, that Griffith was not only born in wedlock, but also the right and proper Prince of Wales by inheritance. Consider likewise how Lhewelyn called all the Lords and Barons of Wales before him to Ystradflur, and caused them to swear to be faithfull subjects, and to do homage to David his son, and that long before his death; which had beeu needlesse and frivolous if David had been his heir, and Griffith his bastard: consider, I say, how that Henry the Third immediately after the death of Griffith, as suming the title of his said prisoner into his own hands, intituled his eldest son Edward to the Principality of Wales, accounting David no."], [73, "55 lawfull prince, as it appears thereby: yea and how, that neither the Bruses Lords of Brechnock, Lacies Earls of Lincoln, nor any other that married Prince David's sisters of the whole blood, pretended any right to the Principality of Wales after his death, though he left no issue of his body to survive him, which such mighty persons would hardly have omitted, if David had been the true heir of Leoline the Great, and lawfull Prince Wales. Furthermore, David Benvras in a funerall elegy to Lhewelyn and his two sons, gives them in generall the name of Princes, and prefers Griffith before David. Whereupon I do conclude, that if Griffith had been a bastard, in all likelihood the bard would not presume to prefer him before David, being legitimate; neither have given him the title of Prince, but that it was his birth right. Again, Polydor Virgil, in the 16th Book of his History of England, denoteth that Griffith was his father's lawfull heir, and that David was an usurper of the Principality upheld by the King of Eng land's favour in these words : Id temporis Leweliivus Walli\u00e6 princeps e vita migravit, deinde inter Gruffinum fy David filios ejus de princi patu disceptatum est; quern ad ultimum David, etsi minor natu, favente Henrico, assecutus est: and a little after, multos Wallorum miser ebat casus Griffini, qui per proditionem avito principatu fraudatus in carcere esset, insidebatque in illorum animis tanti facinoris memoria.' Adde hereunto how Leolinus Gervasii, films desponsavit Tanglwyst, de qua genuit Griffith, as I said before: adde I say the testimony of the Book of Hergcst before mentioned, with the which agrees John Griff. Eyton,"], [74, "56 an author of above an hundred and fifty years antiquity. Here I might cite the opinion of Guttyn Owen and the Bards, who with one consent do testify, that Griffith was his father's eldest son and heir apparent, whose testimonies, seeing their function was nothing else but truly to descant the famous deeds and true pedegrees of the Princes and Nobility of Wales, I hold it good reason that we follow and preferre before the traditions of strangers, who most commonly being enemies to the Welchmen were carelesse of their affaires, and therefore apt to erre in relating their histories, especially since they looked upon it as their interest to conceal or extenuate, rather than declare their glory. And the translators of the Chronicle of Wales, tracing their steps, and for getting the fidelity of translation, added at their pleasure that Griffith was a bastard, and that Gwladys was the sister of David, going besides the old text wherein you shall find no such matter. Also bastards by the Lawes of Howel Dha were excluded from any share of inheritance with their brethren legitimate; but Griffith, as Dr. Powel out of Mathew Paris relateth, \" claimed a portion of his father's inheritance \" according to the customes of Wales, even so much as of riff ht ousrht \" to appertain unto him.\" Which words do insinuate that he was ready to prove his father and mother's marriage lawfully consummated. And David confesseth a portion due to his brother, when in the third arti cle of his submission to Henry III. he saith, \" Item, I, and the said \" Griffith, and either of us, shall hold our portions of land of our said \" soveraign Lord the King in capite\" Lastly, the bastards of the"], [75, "57 Princes of Wales were not tolerated to bear their father's arms; and if permitted, yet not without difference, as may be observed in the coats of Madoc the son of Gwenwynwyn Lord of Powys ; David Goch the son of David Lord of Denbigh and Fradsham; Eneon and Cynwric, twinnes, the sons of Mad. ap Mred. Prince of Powys; and Tegwared y bais wen, being the bastard of Prince Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth, had therefore a peculiar coat of arms given him and his posterity, to wit, Ar. a cheveron S. charged with 3. Mullets pierced. But Griffith father of Lhewelyn the last Prince, gave his father's coat without any change or difference at all, and so did his progeny after him, which proveth that he was lawfully born. These reasons and testimonies do perswade me to think that Griffith was unworthily defamed of bastardy, and defeated of his birth-right under that pretence, But in regard herein I thwart the judgment of good antiquaries, both ancient and modern, I leave the matter to a further debate."], [76, "58 THE TENTH ARGUMENT. The late writers of North Wales cannot agree whether Mervyn or Anarawd were elder. Mr. Humphry Lloyd, following Giraldus, pre ferreth Mervyn; Dr. Powel, Anarawd. How can they then fitly de cide this point, or conclude against Cadelh to be the eldest? It is probable that Giraldus, living in Henry the Second's time, being a native of Wales, and best seen of any (as his works do shew) in the antiquities thereof, and living in a time when there were more store of them than now are, or have been in this last age, and otherwise a great learned man and bishop of St. David's, had as good grounds and helps to prove for Mervyn, as any later writer for Anarawd. Therefore upon this doubt and uncertainty, which of these two were elder, it is safest for the truth to agree upon so good authorities and grounds of reasons for Cadelh to be the eldest, which is confirmed also by the authentick authority of a countryman of North Wales, David Nantmor, the famous Bard, who was and still is of such estimation in North Wales, as none will contradict any thing written by him. Neither would he have de clared the truth so plainly, if there had been any doubt in the matter. And thus he writeth:"], [77, "59 Tri meib i Rodri mewn tremyn\u2014eu keid Cadelh, Nerawd, Mervyn: In English thus: Three sons we find were unto Roderi, Rhannodh efyr hum oedh yn Rhodhiad holl Kymru rhydhyn.

And thus for truth the very manner was, How all divided stood between them three. THE ANSWER. I cannot think it reason from the doubt of North Wales writers whether Anarawd or Mervyn were the eldest son of Roderic the Great, to conclude Cadelh to be the eldest; especially seeing neither our writers nor any else do make any thing for Cadelh, and also that all in general do agree, that the King of North Wales, howsoever he were called, was the eldest of the brethren. Not only Dr. Powel, but a multitude of most ancient writers do prefer Anarawd to the kingdome"], [78, "60 of North Wales, as our ancient Bards and writers of genealogies: Rio rum euim (saith Dr. Powel) cons tans assertio est Anaratum primogeni tum principem fuisse Venedoti\u00e6. The ancient author of Griffith ap Conan's life, brings the pedegree of the said Griffith lineally to Anar awd. Meilir Brydydh (that flourished in William the Conqueror's time) averres the said Griffith to be descended of Anarawd. Carado cus Lancarvanensis affirmes that Anarawd the eldest son of Roderic the Great was King of North Wales. And last of all Ninnius, the old British writer and disciple of Elvodugus, who lived in the dayes of Roderic and his children, saith thus: Anaraught rex Moni\u00e6 (i. e. Mon) qui regit modo regnum Weuedoci\u00e6 regionis (i. e.) Gweinedh. Therefore Giraldus Cambrensis, with his followers Leyland and Lhwyd, must needs be in an error, when he gives his voice for Mervyn. And truly Giraldus Cambrensis, though in antiquity he were most expert and skilfull, yet seems not a little to be ignorant of the true history of Roderic the Great and his children: for besides the former error in the second chapter of his book, intituled, Descriptio Cambri\u00e6, he avers that the said Roderic was the cause of the division of Wales into the three kingdomes of North Wales, South Wales, and Powys: whereas it is apparent, that the said three kingdomes had their several] kings many years before his birth, as Dr. Powel most truly proveth in his notes upon the said chapter: then also he saith, that Cadelh, to whom Roderic had given South Wales for his portion, survived Anarawd and Mervyn, whereby he got the monarchy of all Wales. Cadelh (saith he)"], [79, "61 pr\u00e6mortuis fratribus totius Walli\u00e6 monarchiam obtinuit. And Cara docus, a more ancient writer, testifieth, that Cadelh died six years before Anarawd, with whom agreeth your countryman George Owen Harry, and another most ancient British chronologer, which beginneth thus, Oes Gwrtheyrn Gortheneu, &c. mentioned by Sir John Prise, p. 121, Defensionis Britannic\u00e6 Histori\u00e6. Lastly, he saith that Cadelh's successors even to Theodor enjoyed the said monarchy, whereas it is clear that diverse of the line of Anarawd ruled the king dom of North Wales during that time: so that we cannot but conclude Giraldus to be in a grosse error. And as to the testimony of David Nanmor, on whom relies your whole hope for Cadelh's soveraignty, it is answered, that his authority (had it been as you make it to be, which shall appear to be far otherwise, especially in so ancient a matter as we now handle) being favoured or strengthened by no anti quity, and himself not flourishing before the middle of the raign of Henry the Sixth, would have been too weak to encounter not only Dr. Powel, but a multitude of most ancient authors, well seen in anti quity, that maintain the contrary: I cannot be perswaded that he was ever of that opinion, nor that those verses you are pleased to lay to him are his. They do not savor of the skill of the meanest Bard, much lesse of Nanmor, that sometimes contended with David ap Ed mond for the chair at the Eistedhfa in Caermarthen, and by his Com pod Manuel, his Gorchestion, Cywydhau, Odes and Epigrams, is well known to surpasse most men of his time in poetical science. They II"], [80, "62 have faults as to the measures in four severall places, such as our Bards term Twyll gynghanedh and Twyll odl, which by the teachers of the faculty, to wit, Dr. David Du of Hiradhic, Edyrn Dafod Aur, Eneon Offeiriad, aud diverse others have been damned for schismes and sol\u00e6 cismes in the art, and so forbid to be used. It being so as to the poetry, the history may justly be suspected of mistakes, if not of for gery, in order to the promoting of a small design. And there are mistakes in the history : for Roderic was not the divider of Wales ; and Cadelh is denyed by all writers to be the eldest of the three bre thren; nor was the King of Aberffraw 's name Nerawd, but Anarawd. And in the 5th and last stanza, which you forbear the mention of, there is a manifest error; for therein it is said, that Roderic made his division between his three sons A. D. 811, long before his reign, and probably before he was born; for Caradocus saith he began his reign A. D. 843, and his father Mervyn Frych but in the year 817, at which time Prince Conan Tindaethwy dyed."], [81, "63 THE ELEVENTH ARGUMENT. These authorities and reasons are delivered simply to beat out the truth of this point in question, and chiefly out of a desire to clear the way for a perfect history of Wales, if any shall undertake it ; which otherwise cannot be: for besides this evidence of the soveraignty of the Prince of South Wales (where there never failed a. lawfull prince to govern untill the period thereof, by the fatall overthrow of the last and worthy prince, Prince Rees ap Theodor) it seems not fit to regis ter the acts of Wales for a great part of two hundred years under usurpers. And therefore it is desired that if any shall be disposed to answer hereunto, or to give reasons for maintaining their allegation, it be done without prejudice or partiality, and that they range not out of the limits of the question. THE ANSWER. Whereas you alledge that your authorities and reasons are deli vered simply to beat out the truth of the point in question, I cannot conceive so, in regard you have not been pleased to be so particular in your quotation of authors, as could be desired. And whereas you think it not fit to register the acts of Wales under usurpers, it seems"], [82, "64 you would deprive your reader of a perfect history, and conceale such passages which are as requisite to be known, as the lawfullest pro ceedings; in that a history (how rugged soever the passages thereof may be) ought to testify the truth by the consent of times, and imme diate succession of princes; otherwise that will appear like a broken chaine, wanting some necessary links to unite the whole; neither will man's desire be satisfied, until it receive instruction; who were and who were not usurpers, and how their government differed, or whether usurpers being really possessed of the crown, did not use the same jurisdiction which belonged unto the right heir: and withall tis far more fit and decent that the acts of Wales should be registred under the name of those usurpers of North Wales, in regard that all Wales was subject to the crown thereof, then under the Princes of South Wales (who were, as I said, their subjects and tributaries) though the lawfull heirs of Cadelh. And in my judgment you cannot so confi dently excuse your South Wales government from usurpation for that time, seeing Rotherch ap Iestin, and others, are acknowledged to be usurpers within the compasse of the time limited. You may be further convinced touching the truth of our allegation, if you do but indiffer ently weigh the evident proofs that follow upon these grounds. First, how the soveraignty continued in North Wales before the dayes of Roderic the Great. Secondly, how Anarawd, Prince of North Wales, was Roderic's eldest son. And lastly, how the Princes of South Wales and Powys paid tribute to the Prince of North Wales. To the"], [83, "65 first, if you look back into the times before Roderic's raigne, you must confesse Cadwalhon Lhawhir King of North Wales was chiefest of the four that bare swords before Arthur at the triumphant feast of Caer lheon (of which number, as Galfridus Monemutensis affirmes, the King of South Wales was one:) or you must deny the testimony of your George Owen Harry, page 26. Then afterwards when the Britains wanted a supreme governour, there was a general meeting had for the election of a King, and a continuall supply was had from the Princes of North Wales ; as first it may appear, when (after the death of Vor tiporius, whom we call Gwerthevyr) the Britains met at Traeth Mael gwn, as may be seen in those ancient British laws, intituled Prawf Ynad, Lie y caffas Maelgivn vot yn pennaf brenhin, ac Abcrffraiv yn pen Ihyssoedh, a Iarlh Mathyraval, a Iarlh Dinevwr, a Iarlh Caer- Iheon y danaiv ynteu: which may be thus Englished: Where it was ordained, that Maelgwn (Prince of North Wales) should be the chief est or soveraign King, and Aberffraw in North Wales the soveraign seat of the Britains, and that the Earls of Powys, South Wales, and Caerlheon should be under him and obey him. And after that, when the Princes of South Wales, Powys, and Cornwall, after the battell of Bangor, met at Chester, where with the consent of all those Princes, Cad van Prince of North Wales was made King of Britaine; after him succeeded in their own right Cadwalhon his son, and Cadwalader his grandchild; at which time the Britains lost the soveraignty of the whole Isle, as Galfridus saith. And yet Roderic Molwynoc, Prince of North"], [84, "66 Wales, the grandchild of Cadwalader, was obeyed by all the British Princes as their supreme and soveraigne Prince, and called also King of the Britains, according to all authors: and so was his son Conan Tindaethwy; and after him Mervyn Vrych, King of Man, who in the right of his wife Essyllt, Conan's daughter, was sole Prince of all Wales, as your own George Owen Harry and all other writers testify; and after them succeeded Roderic the Great, their son, who, as Gi raldus saith, toti Walli\u00e6 pr\u00e6sidebat. So then hitherto, that is 300 years before Anarawd's raign, it was not controverted who had the soveraignty; for it being most manifest, that the soveraignty of Wales remained in North Wales, it may perswade an indifferent reader that Roderic would not alter the course of the soveraignty, being a matter of that ancient continuance, especially when it must be confessed, that the Prince of North Wales was eldest son and heir apparent to his father Roderic, as both old and late writers do with one consent con fesse: of which (for brevitie's sake) I will make choice but of few, but such as are reputed to be of best credit and insight in antiquity, to assist me with their testimonies. And first of all Dr. Powel in his notes upon Giraldus, and additions to Caradocus, proveth that Anar awd was the eldest son of Roderic the Great, and sayth further, that he was the right heir of Cadwalader, as is evident by all histories. Sir John Prise, a South Wales gentleman, in his description of Cam bria, saith that Rodericus Magnus, King of Wales, gave North Wales as the chiefest part to his eldest son. Humphry Llwyd in his Brevi-"], [85, "67 ary of Britain, and Jo. Leyland in his notes upon his book intituled Genethliacon Edvardi principis, and the Book of Hergest written in the dayes of Edward IV. averre, that Roderic gave North Wales to his eldest son, adding withall, that Cadelh (who had South Wales) was the third son. Cyndhelw Brydydh Mawr, that is, Cyndhelw the Great Poet, who flourished in the dayes of Henry the Second King of England, writeth thus: I Rodri/Mawr vawr vilwriaeth Gymro I rai Gyrnru helaeth ; A Gwynedh iawn gynnydh aeth I vab hynav y Pennaeth. Caradocus Lancarvanensis forementioned, who wrote in the dayes of Henry the First, testifies in some copies of his Annals, that Roderic had by his wife Angharad diverse sons, as Anarawd his eldest son, to whom he gave Aberffraw with North Wales. Our old books of pedi grees written on parchment above 400 years ago, do attribute the se niority of birth to Anarawd the son of Roderic the Great, and not to Cadelh. To conclude, Asser Menevensis, who flourished even in the dayes of the sons of Roderic, saith in the Acts of King Alfred, that Anaraut filius Rotri cum suis fratribus ad postremum amicitiam Nor thanhymbrorum deserens, de qua nullum bonum nisi damnum habuerat, amicitiam Alfredi regis studiose requirens, ad pr\u00e6sentiam illius advenit, cumq; a rege honorifice receptus esset, fy ad manum Episcopi in filium confirmationis acceptus maximisque donis ditatus, regis dominio cum"], [86, "68 omnibus suis eadem conditione subdidit, ut in omnibus regies voluutati sic obediens esset, sicut Ethered cum MercisJ Here your countryman gives our Anarawd a superiority over his brethren, esteeming them no other wise than his inferiors and subjects, as plainly it appears, when he saith, that King Alfred (of all the brethren) honoured, enriched with great gifts, and entred into league with Anarawd only. This testimony with the rest is sufficient to prove, that Anarawd Prince of North Wales was the eldest son of Roderic the Great, and therefore soveraign King of the Britains, which Merdhin Silvester,\" 300 years before Anarawd 's birth foretold, to wit, that he should be Supreme Prince of the Britains after his father Roderic. Now time calleth me to come to my last argument, which is, that the Princes of South Wales and Powys payed a tribute to the Prince of North Wales. Wherein (to deale briefly) I will not trouble you here with the testimony of our great antiquary Mr. Selden before mentioned in my answer to your Eighth Argument; nor with the authorities of our other late writers, but will content my seise with the Ancient Laws of our British Princes, where thus we read: Try mychdeyrn dyledoc a dhylu gwladychu Cymru oil dan ei therfyneu', Brenhin Aberffraiv, Arglivydd Dinevwr, a hwn Mathraval: tri phrif lys arbenic sydh ir tri theym hyn yn essyddyneu breiniaivl ydhynt, unyw Aberffraw yNgwynedh, Dynevwr yn y Deheu, a Mathraval Wynva yn Powys : a llyma mal y dosparthwyd eu teyrn asau hivynt yn dair rhan, un bia uchafiaeth ar y dhwy, nid amgen noc Aberffraiv pia y bendefigaeth. Teir mychdeyrn dhylyet a dhylyir o"], [87, "69 Gymru oil, Aberffraw gon y dhwylys hynny adhylu, un o Dhinevwr, scfyw honno melget, pedeir tunelh o fel a gassei pedeir mu ymhob tunelh, dicy grenneit ymhob mu, Ihwyth deuwr ar drossol ymhob gren. Peillgel o Wynva a ymodh hunw hevyd. Thus Englished : Three lawfull Kings ought to rule all Wales under its bounds, the King of Aberffraw in North Wales, the Lord of Dinefwr, and this of Mathraval : these three Princes have three principall courts for their princely dwellings, Aber ffraw in North Wales, Dinefwr in South Wales, and Mathraval Wynva in Powys. Thus their dominions were divided into three parts, one hath a soveraignty over the other two, viz. Aberffraw hath the primacy. Three princely tributes are due out of all Wales, whereof Aberffraw ought to have from those two seats, one from Dinefwr, which is a tri bute of honey, viz. four tuns of honey, every tun containing four mu, every mu four grens, every gren as much as two men could carry be tween them on a leaver: the other is the like quantity of flour, of Mathraval Wynva. This I hold sufficient proof that South Wales and Powys were tributaries to North Wales: and this should suffice me for this time, had not Howel Dha, a Prince of South Wales and the son of Cadelh, decreed in his Laws, that as the King of North Wales was to pay a tribute to the King of London, so should all the Kings of Wales pay tribute to the King of North Wales. Lxm li bras est mychdeyrn dyled quod rex Aberffraw reddere debet regi Londoni\u00e6 semel cum acceperit terram suam ab eo; postea verd omnes reges Walli\u00e6 debent terram suam ab eo accipere, i. e. a rege Aberffraiv, fy Hit reddere I"], [88, "70 meicheerd deleet fy abediw post eorum mortem, fy verbum illius, verbum est super omnes reges, fy nullius verbum est super ipsum : that is to say, sixty three pounds is the monarchicall tribute, which the King of Aberffraw ought to the King of London when once he hath received his lands of him: afterwards all the Kings of Wales ought to take their lands of him, that is, of the King of Aberffraw, and to pay him a reliefe after their death. And his law is a law over the Kings, and no man's law is over him. So saith Howel Dha. The weight of these reasons makes me omit diverse others, and many conjectures, together with the vulgar opinion; for seeing before Roderic's time the case is made out by good proofs, and that in Rode ric and his sons times, and their posterity, it is still strengthned with the authorities of both South Wales and North Wales new and old writers, I see no reason why you should not conclude with me, That the Princes of North Wales had the Soveraignty over all Wales."], [89, "71 A mistake touching the pedegree of the earl of carbery corrected. Finding a mistake in a book lately printed, called Cambria Tri mnphans, touching the Pedegree of the Right Honourable the Earl of Carbery, the author making him to be descended from Gwaethvoed of Cardigan, whereas indeed Gwaethvoed of Powys was his ances tor, I thought I should be wanting to my duty to that noble person and the truth, if I did not, when I had an opportunity, endeavour (what lay in me) the rectifying of it. The gentleman the author I do very much respect and honour for his love expressed to our Country in his worthy pains to maintain the honour of it; and do not so much impute the mistake to him, being a stranger, as to our late unskilfull Recorders of Genealogies, who by reason of their not examining things throughly, and not studying Chronology better, have been the occasion of his error. In their writings they deliver to posterity, that Gwaethvoed of Cardigan was the Father of Gweristan, the Grandfather of Blethyn ap Cynvyn King of Wales, the Earl's ancestor; but without any grounds for it, as I shall make it to appear, by shewing, First, That there were two Gwaethvoeds. Secondly, That Gwaethvoed of Cardigan could not be the great Grandfather of Blethyn ap Cynvyn, and so not the Earl of Carbery's ancestor."], [90, "72 That there were two Gwaethvoeds our Books of Pedegrees assure us, which make often mention both of Gwaethvoed Vawr of Powys, and of Gwaethvoed of Cardigan. They are recorded as distinct persons, the one being stiled of Powys, the other of Cardigan, for distinction's sake. And they appear further to be distinct by their distinct Coates of Arms, and distinct Pedegrees : he of Powys beareth vert a Lyon rampant A. imbrued head, feet and tayle; the other Or. a Lyon rampant regardant S. langued and armed G. And for their Pe degrees, books written about 400 years ago, say that Gwaethvoed of Powys was the son of Gwrhydr ap Caradawc ap Lies Llaw ddeawc, &c. to Beli Mawr (Belinus Magnus) Monarch of Britaine, the father of King Lud. and of Cassibelan, who was King when Julius C\u00e6sar first entred Britaine. And there are other books that derive the Pedegree of Gwaethvoed of Cardigan to Gwythno Garanir, Lord of Cantre Gwaelod (to wit, that large Plaine extending itself between the Countyes of Carnarvon, Cardigan, and Pembroke, long since swal lowed up by the sea) thus, Gwaethvoed ap Eunydd, as Lewis Mor gan we saith; but others leaving out Eunydd say, he was the son of Cadivor ap Peredur Peiswyrdh ap Eneon ap Eunydd, and so to the said Gwythno Garanir, and in a direct line from him to Cunedha Wledig, King of the North and Cambria. That Gwaethvoed of Cardigan could not be the great Grandfather of Blethyn ap Cynvyn, &c. for Blethyn was near of this Gwaethvoeds age. Caradoc of Lancarvan, in his History of Wales, tells us, that"], [91, "73 Blethyn was slaine A. D. 1073, being born, as may be conjectured, about 1023, supposing Angharad (Prince Lhewelyn ap Sitsyllt's widow, who was slaine A. D. 1021) to marry Convyn Blethyn's father 1022. Now Gwaethvoed of Cardigan could not be ancienter than Blethyn, if so ancient, will appear, if we examine the Second Book and Fourth Chapter of Giraldus Cambrensis his Itinerarium Cambria; there we may find, that in the year 1188, when Baldwin Archbishop of Canter bury visited Wales, with Giraldus in his company, to perswade the Welsh to list themselves for the holy war against the Saracens, that there was a son of this Gwaethvoed's (an aged man) then living, called Ednowen, a Lay Abbot of Lanbadarn Vawr in Cardiganshire, being 115 years just after the death of Blethyn ap Cynvyn; therefore we must needs conclude this Gwaethvoed could not live long before Blethyn, and if he did live before him any time, he could not so long before him, as to be his Grandfather. Besides, that Gwaethvoed, the Earl of Carbery 's ancestor, was a distinct person from Gwaethvoed of Cardigan, and far ancienter, may from hence further be gathered, viz. that the generations from him to our time are more in number than the generations from Gwaethvoed of Cardigan, as appears by this instance, to wit, my Lord Vauohan the Earl's son is the 21th generation from Gwaethvoed his ancestour; whereas Sir Richard Price of Gogerddan, Baronet, de scended from Gwaethvoed of Cardigan, my Lord's equall in age, is but the 17th in descent from that Gwaethvoed.

Page 1. a Rodri Mawr, according to Gutyn Owain, had seven sons, whose names were Anarawd, Cadell, Mervyn, Meuric, Tudwal, Gwriad, and Gwidlyw. Anarawd succeeded to North Wales, Cadell to South Wales, and Mervyn to Powys, whose son Tryffin, was the ancestor of the lineage of Riw in Lleyn. Meu ric died in consequence of a fall from his horse, in Ystrad Meurig, without issue. Tudwal was wounded in the knee at the battle of Cymryd, near the river Conwy, where the sons of Rodri defeated Edred Long Hair, King of England. In consequence of this wound Tudwal had Uchel Llogeid in Gwynedd bestowed on him by his brothers. This battle is called in the Chronicles, \" Dial Rodri\" the Revenge of Rodri. Gwgon, son of Gwriad, was the ancestor of the family of Nant Mawr in Twrcelyn in Mona. Gwidlyw was the founder of the stock of Llys Penmon. Page 15. * Totum dominium, &c.

Page 17. d Illo enim, &c. For at that time, and long before, all the land of the southern part of Britain belonged and still belongs to King Alfred. For Hemeid indeed with all the inhabitants of Demetia, and compelled by the violence of the six sons of Rodri, had submitted to the royal authority : Hovil also the son of Rees, King of Gleguising, and Brochmail and Feruail, sons of Meuric, Kings of Gwent, compelled by the force and tyranny of Earl Eadred and the Mercians, of their own accord sought the friendship of the same King, that they might have from him power and protection against their foes. Helised also, son of Teudyr, King of Brecon, compelled by the violence of the same sons of Rodri, of his own accord sought the protection of the said King. Page 18. e Gwynedd, in strict acceptation, does not appear to have comprized at any period more than 15 Cantreds: the copy of Hywel Dda's laws ascribed to Morgeneu Ynad and his son Kyvnerth, which assigns 18 Cantreds to Gwynedd, is not of sufficient authority to determine the point in opposition to all authentic records upon the subject. The copy of the laws quoted by Mr. R. Vaughan is a manu script certainly of as late a date as the 14th century, and therefore inadmissible evidence of transactions of the 10th century. It is likewise a Gwentian version of the laws, and this passage in the preface is introduced to shew, that Hywel Dda's authority extended only to 24 Cantreds in South Wales, 18 Can treds in North Wales, and to portions of Powys; the Kings of Gwent being wholly independent of Hywel, and at liberty to receive or refuse his code. None of the Venedotian or Dimetian copies of the laws in troduces this distinction ; and although the admission of the inaccuracy of the passage does not in any way invalidate the argument, these observations to guard the reader from misconception were required."], [98, "70 APPENDIX. Page 19. /The argument in regard to the superior facilities afforded by the fastnesses of North Wale* for security and defence against invaders, may be enlarged by observing that Rodri made it his own pe culiar residence, and was there finally slain in repelling the incursions of invaders. Ibid, a Vallis h\u00e6c, &e. This vale is truly happy on account of its salubrity, fertility, and pleasant ness : the complexion of its inhabitants is healthy ; their heads of a sound constitution, their sight lively, and their old age vigorous and lasting. The vale itself indeed abounding with green meadows, yellow corn fields, numerous villages and churches, smiles exceedingly to the beholder's eye. Ibid. * Est autem h\u00e6c, &c. But this island is beyond all other parts of Wales incomparably fruitful in wheat; so much that it is a proverbial expression in Welsh, \" MUn Mam Gymru,\" which in English is, \" Mon the Mother of Wales,\" because when other countries around have failed, thi6 soil alone with its very rich and fruitful product has been able to sustain all Wales. Ibid. \u00ab Tant\u0153 etiam, &c. The Snowdon hills are reported to be of so great and such immense quan tity, that as it is wont to be said proverbially, The island of Mona is able to suffice men in corn, so are the hills of Snowdon sufficient in pasture for all the cattle of Wales collected together.

The passage in that part of the laws styled Prawf Ynad states, that the occasion for the assembly alluded to was, for the purpose of electing a supreme king after the conquest of England by the Saxons. The congress, which met at Aberdyvi, was composed of the men of Gwynedd, Powys, Deheubarth, Rieinwc (or, as Mr. Vaughan has it, Evas) Morganwc, and Seisyllwc; on which occasion Maelgwn, Prince of Gwynedd, was advanced to the paramount sovereignty of Wales. Page 53 \u2014 4. r Lewelinus Gervasii, &c. Llewelyn son of Iorwerth, Prince of Wales, married first Tanglwyst, daughter of Llowarch Vychan, by whom he had Griffith and Gwladys Ddu, formerly the wife of Ralph Mortimer; after the death of the said Tanglwyst the same Llewelyn married Joan the slaughter of John, King of England, by whom he had Prince David, and Gwenllian the wife of John Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, and Angharad, married first to John de Bruse, Lord of Brecknock, after whose death she was married to Maelgwn Vachan ap Maelgwn ap Rees, and by the same his wife he had a daughter who was married to John Scot, Earl of Chester, who was a nephew of Ranulph, Earl of Chester, on his sister's side. Page 55. s Id temporis, Szc. At that time Llewelyn, Prince of Wales, departed this life : then arose a dispute for the Principality between his son Griffith and David, which at last David, though the younger, under the favour of Henry obtained : and a little after, Many Welshmen sympathized with the case of Griffith who through treachery had been defrauded whilst in prison of his father's principa lity ; and the remembrance of such a crime rankled in their minds. Page C7 \u2014 8. ' Anaraut filius, Sec. Anarawd the son of Roderic, with his brothers, at last deserting the friendship of the Northumbrians, from which he had received no good, but loss, studiously seeking again the friendship of King Alfred, came to his presence, and when he had been entertained honour ably by the King, and at the Bishop's hand received in confirmation for a son, and enriched with very ample gifts, he submitted together with all his on the same condition to the King's authority, that in all things he would be as obedient to the royal will as Ethered with the Mercians. Page 68. \" The prophecies attributed to Merddin Sylvester alluded to in this argument, as foretelling the accession of Anarawd, are evidently the production of some person in the reign of Henry II. The succession of the Princes of North Wales are detailed by name, in the form of a dialogue, in the precise manner in which they reigned down to Owen Gwynedd ; from which time the narrative is too mysterious to admit of an explanation, for the plain reason that the compiler's powers of penetrating futurity were not more acute than those of other people. His testimony however to the fact of Anarawd being the heir of Rodri is important. The division of Wales, as justly observed in the text, was long prior to the time of Rodri. In the Roman times three great districts were known by the appellations of Siluria, Dimetia, and Venedotia : Siluria appears to have comprized the country between the Tywi and the Severn. Dimetia to have ex tended from the river Tywi to the Dyvi, and to have been divided from Venedotia by a dike, still very visible on the Ceri hills, which coursed from Pumlumon to the river Teme, and from Siluria by the mountain range of Brecknockshire. Venedotia contained the remainder of Wales and parts of Shrop shire and Cheshire. After the departure of the Romans these three divisions were sub-divided into six : Siluria formed Gwent, or Morganwc, and Rieinwc ; Dimetia was divided into two, Deheubarth and Seisyllwc; and Venedotia comprized Gwynedd and Powys. These limits were necessarily the objects of frequent contention, and minor chieftains established a supremacy in various districts ; thus Brychan obtained Brecheiniog, Gwaethvoed Cardigan, Edwin Tegeingl, Cynan Meirionydd, &c. at various peri ods. When Rodri ascended the throne, Wales appears to have comprized five great divisions, Gwent,"], [100, "80 APPENDIX. or Morganwc, Dyved, Cardigan and Ystrad Tywi, Powys, and Gwynedd, to the rule of these three last Rodri succeeded. The Princes of these districts, in after times, were enumerated as the Five Royal Tribes of Wales. Page 76. * Iestin ap Gwgant was descended from Tewdrig, King of Gwent, who was father to Meu ric, or Arthur as commonly styled. Iestin, by the procurement of Eineon ap Cadivor ap Collwyn, ob tained the assistance of Robert Fitz-Hamon; in conjunction they defeated Rhys ap Tewdwr, who was obliged to flee. Iestin was dispossessed of his territory soon after in consequence of a disagreement with bis allies, Eineon and Fitz-Hamon, and is reported to have ended his days in a monastic establishment. In the following year (1092) Bernard Newmarch, prompted probably by the success of Robert Fitz- Hamon, invaded Brecknockshire. He was opposed by Bleddyn ap Maenarch, Prince of that district, assisted by his father-in-law Rhys ap Tewdwr : the fortune of war, however, proved adverse to these defenders of their native country, and they were both slain.
