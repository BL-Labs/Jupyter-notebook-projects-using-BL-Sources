The substance of the following Memoir was read at the annual meeting of the Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Society, held at Herstmonceux, July 25th, 1850. It was considered that no subject could so legitimately occupy the attention of the members on that occasion as the history of the noble Castle which had been the cause of their assembling, and on which, until Herstmonceux had attained its present literary celebrity, its title to fame had exclusively rested. With the history of the Castle that of the Manor was inseparably con nected, a subject that could not be properly treated without entering at considerable length into the records of the various illustrious families which have, at different times, been seated at Herstmonceux. These family records, though I fear dry and tedious to the ordinary reader, are of great value to the historian, from the light they shed on some of the most in teresting epochs in the annals of our country ; and any memoir of Herstmonceux would have been so incomplete without them, that I feel it quite needless to offer any apology for having entered at such length, and with so much minuteness, into these details. The field of my investigations, it is true, is not a new one ; several accounts of Herstmonceux Castle aud its lords, more or less imperfect, already exist ; but those who have hitherto treated this subject have been too ready to copy from some previous writer, instead of consulting the original sources of information for themselves, so that tlie same errors have been perpetuated and the same misstatements repeated, and little if any addition made to the facts recorded by Camden or Grose. In the following pages, it is hoped,"], [12, "6 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX that some of these errors have been avoided or corrected, and that as no pains has been spared in examining every known source of information, the result will be satisfactory to the Society, at whose expense this further attempt to illustrate the history of the Castle and Manor of Herstmonceux has been published. Had any additional stimulus to diligent investigation been needed, it would have been furnished by the consciousness that in undertaking to become the historian of Herstmonceux Castle, I was occupying ground already opened by men of the first antiquarian and literary eminence, in whose hands the completion of the task might have been left with far greater advantage, had their other more important avocations per mitted them to spare the time required. Our valued member (that noble veteran in the cause of arch\u00e6ology, who fought its battles and won its victories, before some of us were born), JohuBntton,Esq.,E.S.A.,&c.,had drawn up a paper, illustrative of the ' History and Architectural Character of Herstmonceux Castle,' for the Lewes meeting of our Society in 1848; and I am sure I am only expressing the general feeling of the members present on that occasion, in saying that it was felt to be a disappointment of no ordinary kind, when it was found that, in consequence of the lateness of the hour, he declined favouring them with the memoir to which many had been anxiously looking forward, fearing to overtax the atten tion of the meeting, which had been long on the stretch. This paper, with the generosity which has characterised all Mr. Britton's exertions in the cause of arch\u00e6ology, he at once put into my hand when he learnt that I was engaged upon the history of the Castle, favouring me with his advice and warm encouragement, and granting me the kind permis sion to profit, to the fullest extent, by his labours in this field. Well would it be for arch\u00e6ology, if all who devote themselves to its pursuit were equally free from those petty jealousies which have done so much to retard its progress, arid to hinder the accomplishment of its objects. Nor is it to the researches of Mr. Britton alone that the fol lowing pages are principally indebted for what they may con tain of value and interest ; my thanks are equally due to"], [13, "7 AND ITS LORDS. . Archdeacon Hare, for his liberality in allowing me the use of his MS. Collections for the History of Herstmonceux Castle, and of the invaluable series of drawings executed by the late Mrs. Hare Naylor, illustrative of almost every part of the building before its demolition in 1777. The most interesting of these I have caused to be engraved for the present memoir, of which they will form to many the most attractive feature. It is much to be wished that Archdeacon Hare could have fulfilled his original intention of writing the history of the Castle and the Parish with which his name is so intimately connected ; but his labours in other fields, of far wider interest and more lasting importance, have prevented the accomplish ment of this design ; and it is to be feared that this work will still remain on the list of literary desiderata. A considerable portion of the materials collected by him have been worked up into the following memoir, in which I have sought to dis tinguish those parts in which I have been most largely indebted to his able pen. I am glad to take this opportunity of acknowledging the obligations under which I am for much valuable assistance, to the kindness of fellow arch\u00e6ologists. Mr. Blaauw has aided me with his advice, and readily allowed me to consult him on any point of difficulty : to Mr. Lower and to Mr. Figg I am indebted for much valuable information, which their intimate acquaintance with the antiquities of Sussex so well qualifies them to give. This too is the place for the grateful mention of the liberality of Mr. Petit, who, with his accustomed generosity, has presented the several woodcuts, executed by Mr. Delamotte, illustrative of the Church and Castle. Herstmonceux, 1851."], [14, "8 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX MANORIAL HISTORY. The parish of Herstmonceux is a district of 4535 acres, in the south-eastern part of the county of Sussex, about four miles from the sea-coast. It is locally situated in the rape of Hastings, and the hundred of Foxearl, and ecclesiastically, in the diocese of Chichester, the archdeaconry of Lewes, and deanery of Dallington. \" The first syllable of the name Herstmonceux, as it is spelt by the natives,\" writes Archdeacon Hare, \" is the same word which occurs at the termination of so many names of places, as Penshurst, Lyndhurst, Sandhurst, Midhurst, Wadhurst, Ticehurst, &c. ; and which is also found at the beginning of several names, as Hurstbourn, Hurstpierpoint, Hurstcourtnay. It is a Saxon word, denoting a thick wood, or forest, and has run the changes through all the vowels in the alphabet. Sometimes it is written with an i or a y ; and it is evident that the first syllable in the names of the adjoining places, Horsebridge, Horseye, Horselunges, is merely a corruption of the same word : for Herstmonceux itself is in like manner pronounced Horsemounces by the common people. On the other hand, Harz, the German name for mountains covered with wood, is evidently another form of the same word. In most of our English names it is generally spelt with a u ; but local custom, which in proper names should be decisive, has determined in favour of e. The name is written Herst in ' Domesday Book,' and in almost all the earlier records ; and this orthography may be supported by the authority of the Hercynia Silva, the Roman name for the Harz.\" The reason of this name will be immediately perceived, when it is remembered that we are now standing at the out skirts of the Silva Anderida, the Coit Andred of the Britons, the Atidredesleige, or Andredeswald, of the Saxons, that immense forest which, commencing near Lyme, in Kent, and extending, as the venerable Anglo-Saxon Chronicle * informs us, 120 miles in length from that point, with an average breadth of at least 30 miles, occupied great part of Kent and Surrey, and the whole of Sussex, with the exception of the Ang. Sax. Chron. Ingram, p. 114."], [15, "9 AND ITS LORDS. downs and the maritime levels, and stretched quite into Hampshire. Of this enormous woodland district but few scattered remnants now exist, though its memory is still kept up, as well by the name Weald applied to the whole district, and the prevalence of the word Hurst in the local names, as by the Forests which are still to be found within its ancient limits \u2014 as Ashdown Forest, Dallington Forest, Darvil Forest, &o, though even in these the decay or removal of the timber is fast rendering the appellation less and less appropriate. Of the condition of Herstmonceux in the times previous to the Norman invasion we know nothing, with the exception of the fact recorded in Domesday, that in the time of Edward the Confessor the manor was in the possession of a priest of the name of Edmer, who was not bound by feudal service to any particular lord, but could change his residence, and transfer his lands at pleasure. Dugdale mentions the manor of Herst among the enormous possessions of Earl Godwin, in Sussex, but it does not seem quite clear whether this was Herstmonceux or Hurstpierrepoint. When the invaluable survey of the Conqueror, popularly known as ' Domesday Book,' was compiled, we find Herst in the possession of William son of Robert, earl of Eu,2 being one of 108 manors which, together with the Castlery of Hastings (of which Herstmonceux was long accounted a member), had been bestowed upon his father by his royal relative as a recompense for his eminent services both in the couned chamber and in the field. It was held of him by one Wibert, who was also tenant of considerable lands in Warble ton, Hoo, and other adjacent parishes. The manor was rated at five hides, and contained ten ploughlands of arable. In the demesne, or portion of the manor used by the lord himself, three ploughs were employed ; while on the rest of the manor thirty villeins with twelve cottagers employed sixteen ploughs. In the woods there was pannage for two hogs. It is interesting and important to remark that the 2 \"Wibertus tenet de Comite (de Ow) Herste.

Herstmonceux was no exception to this rule ; in the time of Edward the Confessor (to quote the same time-honoured document) it was valued at six pounds, but afterwards fell to twenty shillings, again rising in value, until at the time of the taking of the survey it was rated at ten pounds. After the Domesday record, a long time, as usual, elapses, without any notice of the manor or its possessors. But there seems no reason to question the truth of Camdens statement, that \" soon after the Norman invasion it became the seat of a noble family, called from it de Herst T Of these the earliest on record is Idonea de Herst, probably the widow of one of the owners of the manor, who, by a deed, of which the original is, I believe, still extant among Mr. Astles MSS. in the Stowe Collection, now at Ashburnham Place, bestowed on the monks of Robertsbridge,3 \" all her land at Prumhel 4 together with the villains, rents, and appurtenances, to hold of her and her heirs in frankalmoigne, on the payment of sixpence a year, as an acquittance for every service.\" In return for which generous gift the monks allowed her \" the common benefit of their house, and the right of participating in the goods of their house for ever,\" besides bestowing on her one mark in silver, and on her son Robert a talent of gold. Tf this Robert were Idonea's eldest son, he must have died before his mother, as we find in the same collection a deed of confirmation of his mother's gift, granted by her son Waleran de Herst.

Regis.* This Waleran de Herst was the first to adopt the surname which has, since his day, formed the latter half of the name of the manor held by him and his lineal descendants till the commencement of the eighteenth century. Whence he derived the name Monceux is uncertain, and though I can confidently say that most of the statements which have been hazarded on this point are incorrect, I am unable to supply the true solution of the difficulty. The Monceux were a Norman famdy, deriving their name from a place in the parish of Gueron, in the diocese of Bayeux, and are stated by some authorities to have come over with the Conqueror. The first of the name I find is Drogo, or Drew de Monceux, who appears on the Pipe Roll of 31 Henry I (1131), and also as a witness to a charier of foundation of Dunstable Priory,6 granted by the same monarch. His wife was Edith, daughter of William de Warren and Gundrada (names dear to every Sussex Arch\u00e6ologist), whose first husband was Gerard de Gournay, who, in the disputes consequent on the Conqueror's death, took part with Rufus against his elder brother Robert, but, from some cause or other, soon transferring his alle giance, with his wife accompanied Robert on his journey to the Holy Land : dying by the way he left Edith a widow in a strange land, and she then became the wife of Drew de Monceux.7 Ingelram de Monceux is the next of the family whose name occurs ; he is mentioned in the Norman Roll 8 as having, in 1183, given to the king, Henry II, the sum of \u00a326. 5*., \" that his judgment might be speeded.\" This mode of forwarding a suit, however strange it may appear to us, was, at that time, the ordinary mode of proceeding in legal causes ; corruption being so universal, even on the throne, that bribery became a necessity to those who would secure the rightful possession of their own. The next document in which the name of Ingelram de Monceux occurs supplies further evidence 5 Members of the same family occur among the benefactors of Battel Abbey. Robert de Herst gave one acre in Sedlescombe ; and William, son of Manser de Herst, a messuage, with other houses, \"juxta aquam de Stonesbath.\" (Reg. de Bello, 1, 234.) \u25a0 Dugdale, Monast. vi, 240. 7 Watson's Earls of Warren, i, 76. 8 Madax's Exchequer, i, 166."], [18, "12 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX of this lamentable fact. In this we find that \" William de Warburton and Ingelram de Monceux give to our lord the king,\" John, who was just seated on his unstable throne \" the sum of 500 marcs, to have the inheritance which belonged to Juliana, the wife of William the son of Aymer, whose next of kin they affirm they are.\"9 This inheritance consisted of land at Compton, in Hampshire, afterwards known as Compton Monceux. Five years later, 6\u00b0 John, Waleran de Munceux (the same with Waleran de Herst above mentioned) gave 100 marcs, in order that he might have his just proportion of the said estate, of which one-half fell to him, and the other, together with the esnetia, or elder son's portion, to William.10 Eleven years later, William, the son of Waleran, had seisin granted of lands in Hampshire, probably the estate in ques tion. What the connection between Ingelram and Waleran was, it is difficult to determine, but it seems that it was from him that the name was adopted, which was thenceforward borne by the family (that of Herst being entirely dropped), and which has been perpetuated in the names of the parishes, Herstmonceux and Compton Monceux, in Hampshire. Waleran appears again in 1207 as one of the bail of Roger, the son of Adam, sheriff of Hampshire ;u but he must have died shortly after that date, as in the first year of Henry III, a.d. 1217, his son and heir, William, had \" such seisin of his lands,\" granted by the sheriff of Hampshire, 9 Rot. de Fin.

The honours heaped on this nobleman and the other relations of the queen, who, though aliens in blood, monopolised the chief offices of dignity in the realm, and were enriched with the spoils of the young noblemen placed under their guardianship, produced great disgust among the neglected English,16 and may be reckoned among the causes which led to the alienation of the barons from their sovereign, and the sanguinary battles of Lewes and Evesham. In 1241-2, when the inquisitions contained in the Testa de Nevill for Sussex were taken, Peter de Savoy is returned as holding the honour of Warren,17 as guardian of the earl, as well as the honour and barony of the Eagle in capite, for two knights' fees and a 12 Clause Rolls, 1 Hen.

From other parts of the same collection of documents, we find that he also held Little Ongar, in Essex,19 and three-fourths of a knight's fee in Cumpton,20 by the service of mareschaucie, i. e. of shoeing and acting as farrier to the king's horses, whenever it might please him to require such services. Waleran de Monceus, second of the name, succeeded his father, William, and took a prominent part in the civd dis turbances of the times, on the side of Simon de Montfort, against King Henry III ; who, in the spring of 1264 (as we learn from a MS. cited in Mr. Lower's ' Chronicle of Battel Abbey '), when on his way from Battel to the disastrous field of Lewes, spent the night at Herstmonceaux, where, while his army were employing themselves in hunting and destroy ing the park, a certain nobleman, named Roger de Tournay, struck by a stray arrow in the throat, miserably perished.21 This notice establishes the fact of the existence of a manor house previous to the erection of the present Castle, of which no other record is met with ; even its site cannot be accu rately determined, though it is probable that it stood in the same position as at present, as the fine Spanish chestnut trees to the west of the Castle seem to be older than the building itself; and as this must doubtless have been the reason why the church erected in the 13th century (one having existed at the time of the Domesday survey) was placed at the extremity of the parish, at a distance from all the inhabitants, except the immediate retainers of the lord of the manor. The battle of Lewes terminated, as it is needless to remind the reader, in the total defeat of the king and his forces. Among the prisoners taken by de Montfort was Robert de 18 Alice, daughter of Henry VI, earl of Eu, married Raoul de Lusignan, circa 1200 ; she died circa 1246, and was buried in the abbey of Foucarmout.

After her departure to France, in October of the same year, the Castle was recovered by Prince Edward, and in the following year we are glad to read the record of the pardon of Waleran de Monceus, among many others.23 The next record in which the name of Waleran appears (7\u00b0 Ed. I, a.d. 1278-9) speaks of more quiet thnes, and a more settled state of public affairs. It is a claim brought by him through his attorney,24 by name Simon de Sipton, for the right of free warren at Herst and Lanekestrode ; the claim was brought before a jury who decided in Waleran's favour ; with a reservation for the rights of the king to moot the question again whenever he might see fit. His wife was Joan de Saunford, a tenant of the king in capite, whose lands were taken into the king's hand on her death in 1278. She also held the manor of Shelley in Essex, of the earl of Hereford, by the service of one knight's fee.25 About this period Herstmonceux was honoured by another royal visit : on Friday, Sept. 15th, 1302, Edwardi visited Herstmonceux on his way from Michelham Priory to Battel.26 On the death of Waleran the manor passed to his son John, who died in the 30th year of Edward I, and by a post mortem inquiry was found possessed of Compton Manor, Hants, and East Hurst, Sussex.

This was the last possessor of the manor who bore the name by which it still continues to be distinguished. John de Monceux died without issue, and his sister, Maud, who inherited his estates, carried them into the noble family of Fienes, on her marriage with Sir John de Fienes about the middle of Edward the Second's reign.29 It will now be necessary to leave the immediate subject of our consideration for a short time, and turn our attention to the family of Fienes, who then became the possessors of the manor of Herstmonceux, and in whose descendants it remained till the time of Queen Anne. This family, which for many generations was one of the most considerable in the south of England, derived its origin from Conon de Fiennes,30 who in 1112 was earl of Boulogne, taking his name from a vdlage in the Boulonnais territory.

The statement given by Collins and others is that he received the manor of Wendover, Bucks, in exchange for the constableship of Dover ; but this is probably incorrect, as that manor came into the family by the marriage of Ingelram de Fienes (the progenitor of the branch under consideration) with Sibyl de Tingrie,33 the daughter and heiress of Pharamuse of Boulogne, the nephew of Maud the queen of Stephen. A royal marriage was at that time, as we have already had occasion to remark, regarded as the signal for the arrival in England of swarms of needy foreigners, the relations or dependants of the new queen, who were too often enriched at the expense of the more legitimate candidates for the favour of their sovereign. Pharamuse seems to have risen high in the esteem of his royal uncle, from whom he received, in addition to the lucrative position of Comptroller of his House hold and other substantial proofs of his affection, the manors of Wendover, Bucks,34 and Clapham and Carshalton in Surry.35 The manor of Martok in Somerset he was already possessed of by inheritance, from Eustace, earl of Boulogne, father of the well-known Godfrey, king cf Jerusalem, to whom it had been given by Wdliam the Conqueror.36 Sibyl inherited the whole of these vast domains, which, by her marriage with Ingelram de Fienes, she transferred to that famdy, who from that time appear to have made England their principal home. \" Ingelram dicto domino de Fenes alibi, et ita recessit de otiicio constabularii et Dominus Hubertus de Burgo Comes Kanci\u00e6 factus est constabularius castri.

Sibyl, after her husband's death \"in viduitate et libera potes- tate mea,\" confirmed the grant of a hide of land in Balham, belonging to the manor of Clapham, to the abbey of Bee, in Normandy.33 Another gift of hers on record strikes a reader as somewhat extraordinary. It is that of one William Hauwis, a freeman, belonging to her manor of Wendover \" with all belonging to him, and all the progeny he has or ever may have, together with all his goods and chattels,\" to Reginald son of Alexander, lord of Hampden, who is in return to render to her and her heirs two capons yearly at Martinmas.39 A simdar benefaction is recorded on the part of her son Wdliam, who gave to the canons of S.

In 1206, April 19th, King John granted William de Fienes \" such plenary seisin of the manor of Martok, Somerset, as his mother Sibyl had.\"45 A year afterwards, Mar. 15th, 1207, this manor and that of Wendover, Bucks, were still in her hand, and the king issued his warrant from Farnham to the sheriffs of the two counties to give William possession of the lands \" which his mother Sibyl gave up before us in our court,\"46 and to allow her a reasonable provision, \"rationabde estuverium \" from the same land. From the various entries in the Clause Rolls, William would appear, at one time, to have stood high in his sovereign's favour. A few years subsequent to the foregoing extracts, a warrant appears to \" William the son of Peter to allow Luke, William de Fienes' s chaplain, to have one palfrey \" probably out of the royal stud \" on purchase.\"47 Both Wendover and Martok, being portions of the royal demesne, appear to have been continually taken into the king's hand, and transferred from the Fienes to other lords, who might happen, for the time, to stand higher in the favour of the fickle sovereign, or whose good will it was desirable to purchase by some substantial mark of royal approbation. These frequent changes caused great intricacy in the records of this period. Collins refers to an ancient deed, which proves that Martok48 had been, at one time, held by Widiam, the son of King Stephen, who gave it to Wdliam de Fienes. Wendover, which we have seen, was among the possessions of Pharamuse and his daughter Sibyl, we find, a.d. 1210, in the hands of Hugh Gurney, who gave 700 marcs for licence to hold it.49 In 1214 he took part with the rebellious barons, and forfeited his lands, which were not however immediately restored to their legitimate owner, but in lieu of them the sum of \u00a360 was assigned out of the royal treasury,50 \" donee ei alibi providerimus.\" The next year (Sept. 15, 1215), the sheriff was commanded by the king to grant him full seisin of his hereditary estate of Wendover. John was then at Dover, anxiously awaiting the mercenary recruits from the continent, by whose means he hoped to reduce the insurgent barons, and annul the great \u00ab Clause Rolls, i, p. 68. 4G Ibid. p. 79. *' Ibid. p. 112. 46 Collins's Proceedings, p. 50. **9 Lipscombe's Bucks. 5IJ Clause Rolls, i, p. 185."], [26, "20 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX charter, which had just been extorted from him ; and from the tenor of the above-mentioned warrant, he would seem to have reckoned on the active support of William de Fienes in the accomplishment of his purpose. But since, in the next year, July 25, 1216,51 de Fienes was deprived of his manor of Martok, and described in the warrant as \"being with the king's enemies,\" \" qui cum inimicis nostris est,\" the probable inference is that he had refused to accede to John's demands, and had joined the standard of the French Prince Louis, to whom the barons had offered the English crown. It is how ever not improbable that he was disgusted with the arrogance of Louis, and soon returned to his aUegiance ; for in little more than a month (Sept. 5, 1216),52 full seisin of his manor of Wendover, which was probably forfeited at the same thne with Martok, was restored by the king, who, in five weeks from that time (October 18), terminated his inglorious existence at Newark-on-Trent. One of the first acts of those who exercised the royal authority in the name of the young King Henry III, was to issue a warrant to the bishop of Winton, commanding him to allow W. de Fienes peaceable possession of his lands \" in bailla sua,\" 53 so long as he rendered faithful service to the king. And the next year (Jan. 27, 1217), such seisin in the vdl of Martok is granted, as he had before the war;54 and in 1218 we find he had already paid 200 marcs for having seisin of Wendover.55 In 1221 he paid a hundred marcs for having custody of the lands in Kent, which belonged to Arnold, Earl of Guisnes.56 Martok and Wendover were taken into the king's hand, on account of his not coming or sending to the king's army in Wales,57 but he soon made his peace with his feeble sovereign, and had re-seisin granted of his lands. In the Testa de Nevill 58 the name of W. de Fienes occurs, as holding one fee in Gessick All Saints, and two fees, one of which was of the new assessment (unde unum de novo) in Somerset and Dorset, for which he paid scutage to the amount of \u00a32. 3s. 4d. in the nineteenth and twentieth years of Henry III, a.d. 1235-6.

Ill, a.d. 1240-1, and was succeeded by his son Ingelram, who married a daughter of Jacques, lord of Conde, by whom he had two sons, Wdliam, and Giles, the progenitor of the Fieneses of Herstmonceux. He inherited his paternal manors, and, a.d. 1243, March 3, \" received the king's discharge for ten pounds, which he owed for his relief, and had respite for a further debt of fifteen marcs.\" 62 The next year his manors of Martok, Clapham, Wendover, &o, were taken into the king's hand, by reason of an inquisition concerning the lands of Normans and strangers : but his mother Agnes was permitted to have the administration of her son's goods together with the wheat and other produce of the manors,63 until their restoration, which does not seem to have been long deferred.64 About this period many entries occur in the Close and Fine Rolls, confirming the remit tance 65 of the debts of his father and grandmother Sibyl, and postponing the demand of his own from time to time. In the Testa de Nevill he stands as the inheritor of his father's manors of Clapham and Carshalton ; the latter held of H. de Bohun, earl of Hereford, of the honour of Mandevdl.66 Ingelram played a very conspicuous part in the civil wars, which caused so much misery and bloodshed during the reign of the weak and fickle Henry III ; and in all the complicated scenes of confusion which accompanied the contest between the king and the barons, he remained firm in his allegiance to his sovereign.

Ingelram distinguished himself by his valour on the field of Evesham. The date of his death is uncertain, but it occurred before the 54th Henry III, a.d. 1269-70, when William de Fienes, who \" was in parts beyond sea at his father's decease,\" was found to be his heir.68 He had accompanied Saint Louis in his expedition to the Holy Land a.d. 1248, and in this very year his name occurs among the knights of the household who attended that king on his expedition to Tunis;69 after the fatal termination of which, he and his brother Sir Giles proceeded a second time to Palestine in the train of Prince Edward and his cousin, the son of the king of the Romans. The guardianship of his lands was granted to the queen until his return to England,70 and William de Ambesas71 was appointed his attorney to manage his affairs during his absence. Ambesas, as bailiff of Martok, Gayton,72 Clapham, and Carshalton, had ample oppor tunity of enriching himself at his lord's expense, an art he seems to have understood so well, that on de Fienes's return in 1292 he found it necessary to enter an action against him, to compel him to give an account of his stewardship The result was however that he not only, by means of a legal quibble, successfully resisted the demand, but turned the tables on his old master, leaving him at the mercy of the court for putting forward a false claim.73 63 Clause Rolls, 54 Hen.

Sibyl was alive in 1296, so that she must have been very young, in all probabdity a mere chdd, in 1223, the date of the so-called abduction, which might in fact have amounted to no more than the lawful guardian taking his ward into his own keeping until she were of age to choose a natural protector for herself.

He married Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of William de Batsford, whose wife Margery98 was the heiress of Simon de Peplesham. With her he inherited the reversion to the manor of Bucksteep and a watermill in Warbleton parish, besides large estates in Dallington, Wartling, and other adjoining parishes. Elizabeth died before her mother Margery, on whose decease, in the year 1407, all her estates passed to her grandson Roger Fienes, the elder son of William and Elizabeth. Sir Wdliam Fienes died in the year 1405, and was buried in the chancel of the parish-church beneath a monumental slab adorned with his portraiture in brass, in full armour, 95 Rot. Orig.

The younger, Sir James, in 1438-9 was sheriff of Sussex and Surrey, and in 1449 became lord high treasurer of England. His grandmother, as we have seen, was Joan, sister and coheir to Wdliam de Say, and in her right he was summoned to the parliament held at Bury St. Edmunds, in the year 1447, as Lord Say and Sele, and in consideration of his eminent services declared a baron of the realm.100 This is not the place to pursue his histoiy any further, or to speak of his tragical end when attempting to quell the insurrection under Jack Cade, of which an account will be found in every history of England.

Thomas, the second Lord Dacre of the South, served in arms against the Cornishmen, in 1492, and in the following year was Constable of Calais. On the 17th of December, 1508, he was one of the witnesses present in the great cham ber in the palace of Richmond, when the espousals were con tracted between the Archduke Charles and the Lady Mary, daughter of King Henry VII. Fourteen years afterwards (May 27th, 1522) he was one appointed to give attendance on the king at Eaylesbury, on the coming of the emperor, with Sir Thos.West and Sir John Hussey.111 Soon after this Lord Dacre was for some time a prisoner in the Fleet, on the charge of receiving and harbouring sus pected felons, as appears from the following singular document among the Burghley Papers, dated Feb. 7th, 1525.112 \" The Lord Dacres hathe this daye knowledged and con- 110 Nicolas' Test.

Thomas, Lord Dacre, died in 1534 : the provisions of his wdl (dated Sept. 1, 1531) are of considerable interest to the ecclesiastical antiquary. They are as follows : \u2014 \" My body to be buried in the parish church of Hurst Monceaux, on the north side of the high altar.

In pursuance of the directions of this wdl, the stately monument which adorns the chancel of the parish church was erected, and which, though it has suffered much from time and the barbarous hand of sacrilege, and the scarcely less barbarous touch of renovation, may justly be styled one of the finest specimens of monumental architecture in the county of Sussex. Beneath its richly -fretted canopy repose the effigies of Thomas, Lord Dacre, and his son, Sir Thomas Dacre (who preceded his father to the tomb), each clad in complete armour, with the exception of the head which is bare, with their hands raised in an attitude of supplication. Lord Dacre had married Anne, the daughter of Sir Humphry Bourchier, a grand daughter of John, Lord Berners. His son had allied himself to the house of Sutton, having taken to wife Joan, daughter of Edward and sister of John, Lord Dudley. On the death of his grandfather (a.d. 1534-5), Thomas, the son of the above-named Sir Thomas Dacre, inherited the title. This id-starred youth had barely attained his seventeenth year when he was called to succeed to the honours and responsi bilities of one of the oldest baronies in the kingdom ; a burden he was little fitted for, either by age or education. The testimony afforded by the paper, printed above, from the Burghley MSS., as to the character of his grandfather's asso ciates, shows us the corrupting nature of the atmosphere which he breathed at Herstmonceux, and the evil influences with which his boyhood was surrounded (dangers rendered all the more formidable from the premature death of both his parents),114 and leaves us less room for surprise at the circum stances which led to his calamitous end. The first notice we find of young Lord Dacre is on the arrival of Anne of Cleves, in 1 540, when he, accompanied by the Duke of Norfolk and Lord Mountjoye, headed the stately cavalcade of knights and esquires, \" all in coates of velvet, with chaynes of gold,\" who met their queen-expectant on Rainham Down, on her way from Sittingbourne to Rochester, where so mortifying a reception awaited her from her royal bridegroom.115 114 The date of his father's death is uncertain, but it was certainly before 1534. His mother's burial is recorded in the parish register as having taken place August 9, 1529. 11S Ilolliushed, iii, 811."], [42, "36 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX The next year saw the premature and cruel termination of this young man's career. That event, and the circumstances which led to it, are thus related by Holhnshed : \u2014 \"There was executed at Saint Thomas Waterings116 three gentlemen, John Mantell, John Frowds, and George Roidon ; they died for a murther committed in Sussex, in companie of Thomas Fines, Lord Dacres of the South : the truth whereof was thus.

But neuerthelesse, at three of the clocke in the same afternoone, he was brought forth of the tower, and deliuered to the shiriffs, who lead him on foot betwixt them unto Tiburne, where he died.

But for the said yoong lord, being a right towardlie gentleman, and such a one as manie had concerned great hope of better proofe, no small mone and lamentation was made ; the more indeed, for that it was thought he was induced to attempt such follie, which occasioned his death, by some light heads that were then about him.\"118 Archdeacon Hare remarks : \" It is impossible to make out from this account what was the extent of Lord Dacre's m Mr. Hayley says (MSS., i, 743), \"This case is carefully recorded in all the report books, ancient and modern, and has ever since been referred to in the courts of justice, as a notable precedent. The truth might perhaps be that he was so far persuaded to take the thing upon himself as to say, ' that he first proposed and induced his friends to go on that party ;' which declaration might have been made an ill use of with the king ; and putting the matter in this light may reconcile the seeming disagreement between the historians and the lawyers in their relation of this affair. According to Stow, these poaching frolics, for they hardly merit a severer name, were by no means unsrequent at that period. He says, in his Annals, under the year 1526, ' In the month of May was proclamation made against all unlawful games, &c. : in all places tables, dice, cards, and bowls were taken and brent ; and when young men were restrained of these games and pastimes, some fell to drinking, some to ferretting of other men's conies, and stealing of deer in parks, and other nnthriftiness.' \" It is hardly necessary to refer to Shakspeare's feat in the park of Sir Thomas Lucy, which will have ere this occurred to the reader's mind."], [44, "38 THE CASTLE OE HERSTMONCEUX criminality. The law appears to have been strained,119 in order to convert him into an accomplice ; and the manner in which the execution was precipitated inclines one to suspect that there must have been foul play, and to give ear to Camden's statement, that ' his great estate, which the greedy courtiers gaped after, caused them to hasten his destruction.' 12\" In that age of legal crimes, when Tarquin's policy of cutting off the tallest poppies seemed almost to be the order of the day, an execution, being so frail a proof of guilt, hardly brought shame ; and that of so young a man as Lord Dacre, when so many persons of greater eminence were laying their heads on the block,121 attracted little notice. Possibly it may attract more now, as it has been made the subject of a tragedy within the last few years by a popular writer,122 every other subject being exhausted.\" This unfortunate young man was buried in the church of St. Sepulchre, by Newgate, where the bodies of many of those who suffered at Tyburn were interred. He had married a daughter of Lord Abergavenny, and left two sons, Thomas 123 (who died at the age of fourteen or fifteen, in the first year of Mary's reign, a.d. 1553) and Gregory, and a daughter Margaret, who were restored in blood and honours by Act of Parliament in the first year of Elizabeth, a.d. 1558. His family had not been deprived of their paternal estates, which were saved from forfeiture by the strictness of the entails made by his great-grandfather.

In 1641 he was recommended by the parliament as curator or lieutenant of Herefordshire ; and in 1646 was appointed one of the commissioners for the pre servation of peace between England and Scotland ;130 but when he found into what excesses his party was running, and the dangerous hands in which power was being vested, after many ineffectual attempts to resist their anarchical measures, he withdrew, and, together with several other peers, absented himself from the House of Lords, at which, we may gather from the following letter extracted from the 'Lords' Journals,' he had previously been a punctual attendant. Writing from his castle at Herstmonceux, Jan. 22, 1643, to Lord Grey of Werke, the deputy-speaker of the House, he says \u2014 \" On Wednesday night last I received your lordship's of the ninth of this month, and would have most gladly obeyed the commands of the House of Peers, by coming presently away to wait on the affairs of the kingdom on the 22nd, had not the ways ever since been so extremely clogged by a very deep snow, that men pass not without much difficulty and danger : I beseech your lordship to add to this reason the weakness of my own health, not being able to endure the rigour of the journeying on horseback in such exceeding cold weather, as now it is ; and to represent this to their lordships' favourable constructions; not that I intend to make long use of any way to excuse myself from that duty, which I shall ever owe to the commonwealth, but very shortly shall give my attendance on their lordships with ad willingness and readiness.

When the ordinance for the trial of Charles I was about to be brought into the house, and ad the absent peers were summoned to attend on the twenty-eighth of December, he was prevented by sickness from obeying the summons imme diately; but on the second of January 1648, when the bill was brought up from the lower House, ordaining that \" a high court of justice for the trial of the king be erected,\" Lord Dacre was in his place to give his voice against it, forming one of the small but noble band of peers who had the courage to come forward in that emergency in defence of their sovereign ; an act of loyalty which was so much resented, that Sir James Harrington and others were most vehement in their demand that the twelve lords should be impeached \" as favourers of the grand delinquent of England, and enemies to public justice and the liberty of the people.\"131 He lived to see the restoration of Charles II, and on the failure of the male line of the Lord Dacres of the North, obtained possession of several lordships of great value in Cumberland and Westmoreland. He died in 1662, and was buried at Chevening ; his wife, the daughter and co-heir of Paul, Lord Bayning, survived him, and in 1680 was created countess of Sheppey. His son Thomas, Lord Dacre, was the last descendant of the ancient families of Herst aud Monceux who possessed the castle and manor which stdl bears their name. The cause of the alienation of this ancient property were his own extra vagance and heavy losses at play, which rendered it necessary for him to part with some of his estates, to retrieve his broken fortunes. He had the misfortune to come very young to the dissipated court of Charles II, with whom he was brought into famdiar intercourse by his appointment as lord of the bed-chamber, and received the very questionable honour of king's son-in-law, through his marriage with the Lady Ann Palmer, alias Fitzroy, daughter of the duchess of Cleveland. With her he obtained a dowry of \u00a320,000, and in 1674, was created earl of Sussex, a title which died with him. A very considerable sum must have been expended by him in the alteration, and as it was then doubtless considered the im provettfcnt, of Herstmonceux Castle ; for it was by him that 131 Parl.

It was in 1708 that the estate of Herstmonceux for the first time exchanged owners by purchase.132 The new possessor was Mr. George Naylor, of Lincoln's Inn (caded by Sir W. Burred \"Councillor Naylor\"), who paid \u00a338,215 for the whole estate, castle and manor. Mr. Naylor married Grace, daughter of the first Lord Pelham, and sister of the Duke of Newcastle, who died in 1710, leaving one daughter, Grace, who died, unmarried, in 1727. The heir of Mr. Naylor's estates was Francis Naylor, the son of his sister Bethia, who had married Dr. Francis Hare, of King's Codege, Cambridge,133 succes sively chaplain to the forces under the Duke of Marlborough,134 chaplain to Queen Anne, Fedow of Eton, canon of St. Paul's, and rector of Barnes ; dean of Worcester, 1715 ; dean of St. Paul's, 1726 ; bishop of St. Asaph, 1727 ; and finally bishop of Chichester, 1731, which see he held till 1740, when he died at Chalfont St. Giles, Bucks (where he had purchased an estate called the Vach), and was buried in the parish church. Bishop Hare is described by a contemporary (the Rev. Wm. Cole) 135 as \" a man of sharp and piercing wit, of great 132 Lord Sussex preserved his estate at Chevening, where he resided till his death, in 1715. Collins says (Peerage, vi, p. 385), \"As the first part of his life was spent in the gaieties and bustle of a court, the latter part of it was dedicated to retirement, living almost entirely at his house in Kent, in which county he always preserved a great interest and influence, and was much beloved by the gentlemen of the neighbourhood, on account of that sweetness of temper and affability for which he was ever most remarkable. He was one of the lords who, upon James the Second's first quitting Whitehall, signed the invita tion to the Prince of Orange to take the conduct of the state.\" 133 Bishop Hare filled the office of tutor of his college for some years, and in that capacity had under his charge the Marquis of Blandford, the eldest son of the Duke of Marlborough, who died of smallpox in 1702, and was buried in Provost Hacombleyn's chantry in King's chapel, beneath a cumbrous mass of marble, inscribed with a laudatory epitaph from his tutor's pen. The famous Antony Collins was also among his pupils, on which account he was complimented by Wolston, and became an object of unjust suspicion to the so-called orthodox party. 134 His journal of Marlborough's Campaigns in 1704-5 is among Archdeacon Coxe's papers, MSS.

Towards the end of Queen Anne's reign (1714) he pub lished, anonymously, a tract entitled ' Difficulties and Dis couragements which attend the Study of the Scriptures in the way of private Judgment.' This book was thought to have so evd a tendency in promoting scepticism and a loose and vague way of thinking in religion, that the Convocation judged it right to pass a severe censure upon it. It was, in fact, an exquisite piece of ironical writing, the true bearing of which his opponents were either too dull, or too blinded by prejudice to perceive. Warburton, in his 'Dedication to the Freethinkers,' praised it highly, calling the author \" one of the greatest and advocate of the liberal party both in religion and politics to be any favourite with Cole, who speaks of him as \" of a sour and crabbed disposition and behaviour,\" and states that \" the character he bore in the world was of a very learned and ingenious, but at the same time of a very unpolished and rough sort of man.\" 136 At the time of his death he had in preparation an edition of Plautus, the collections, and notes for which are among the Additional MSS. in the Museum, 5171, 2. nr Warburton said, \" Good sense is the foundation of criticism ; this it is that has made Dr. Bentley and Bishop Hare the two greatest critics that ever were in the world.\" (Nichols' Lit.

In political matters he displayed the same ability as in criticism and theology ; and his pen was frequently employed between 1706 and 1712 in vindicating the measures of the Whig administration and the conduct of the war, in opposition to the strictures of Swift and the Tory party. In 1718 he was dismissed from his royal chaplaincy, to gether with Dr. Sherlock and Dr. Moss, on the strength of party-prejudice ; but on the accession of George II he was restored to the favour of the court, and was appointed Bishop of St. Asaph. Queen Caroline intended to have nominated him to the see of Bath and Wells, but yielded to the remon strances of the ministry, who alleged \" that it would disoblige the whole bench of bishops to have the new consecrated ones let into the best preferments at once.\"139 Nine years later he narrowly missed elevation to the primacy ; for on Archbishop Wake's death, in 1736, Sir Robert Walpole, whose tutor he had been, designed Bishop Hare as his successor ; but a hun dred years ago the prime minister's power was not quite so absolute in episcopal appointments as it has since become ; and his wishes were effectuady thwarted by Lord Hervey, who used his influence with Queen Caroline to strengthen the prejudices which had grown up in her mind against one who must have been singularly unfitted to play the part of a courtier, and to urge the claims of Potter, bishop of Oxford, who eventually succeeded to the vacant throne.140 139 Nichol's Lit. Anec. 140 During Archbishop Wake's illness, in 1736, there was a question who should succeed him.

By his first wife Bishop Hare had only one son, Francis, whom, as his fellow-codegian Cole informs us, he brought up in a severe manner, making him speak Greek as his ordinary language with him in the family. Late in life the bishop married, as a second wife, the daughter of Colonel Alston, of Suffolk, to whose younger sister his son was engaged, though his father prevented the marriage taking place during his lifetime. The bishop resided for some considerable time at Herst monceux Castle, but his son Francis Naylor, who was a man of fashion (commemorated, I believe, in ' Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea'), entirely neglected his venerable mansion, residing, when out of town, with his brother-in-law, Mr.Soame,at Thurlow in Suffolk;141 so thatwhen upon his death in 1775, it devolved upon his half-brother, the Rev. Robert Hare, the bishop's son by his second marriage, the whole budding was in such a state of decay, that the expenditure of a very considerable sum was required to put it into habit able repair. The building was surveyed by Mr. Samuel Wyatt (a name which awakens anything but kindly feelings in the mind of the architectural antiquary) in 1777, and pro nounced by him to be so dilapidated, that it was judged expedient to demolish the interior of the castle, and employ the materials in building new rooms to the mansion-house on the west side of the park. His advice was unhappily followed; the new house, for such in point of fact it became, was erected with the spods of Roger Fienes' venerable him. Hare having been his tutor at the university, gave Sir Robert some prejudices for him ; and the good correspondence in which he had lived with him ever since made his vanity, I believe, more inclined to Hare than Potter, as the promotion in that case would be more marked out to have been made solely by his influence. Lord Hervey told him, ' You will certainly repent of it if you take Hare. He is a haughty, hard-natured, impe rious, hot-headed, injudicious fellow, who, I firmly believe, would give you more trouble at Lambeth than even Sherlock himself ; and besides that, is so thoroughly disliked in private and feared in public life, that I do not think you could lodge power in more unpopular hands.' This did not weaken Sir Robert's bias towards him ; but Lord Hervey's constantly talking to the queen in this strain, strengthened the natural bias she had against him ; and his lordship never lost any opportunity of doing Potter as many good offices as he did ill ones to Hare, and as all he said on these two subjects had the groundwork of her own inclination, it made an impression which, without that aid, would have sunk less deep, and been much easier effaced.\" (Lord Hervey's Memoirs, ii, 110.) 141 Cole, xxviii, 161."], [52, "46 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX mansion. However much we may find to commend in the arrangements of the modern house, and in the beautiful proportions of the apartments, which were so courteously thrown open to our Society by the kindness of our valued member, the proprietor of the estate ; we shall all, I think, agree that Mr. Wyatt's raw white stucco is but a poor substitute for Roger Fienes' mellow red brick, and mourn over the destruction of so magnificent a pile, as indeed a national loss, the more to be lamented, as it is utterly irreparable.

ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION OE THE CASTLE. Having now completed the history of the Manor of Herst monceux and its Lords, and traced its descent through its successive possessors from the reign of Edward the Confessor to that of Victoria, it remains that I should furnish some account of the architectural character of the noble Castle whose ruins still attest the skid of its designer, as well as the magnificence of the noble famdy of which it was for more than three centuries the principal, seat. In this division of my work it will be my endeavour not merely to describe the building as it at present exists, but also to set before my readers its appearance and arrangement previous to the de struction of its interior in 1777, when this noble building, almost unrivalled among the existing specimens of our domestic architecture, fed a victim to female caprice, and the false taste of an age blind to the merits of our medi\u00e6val structures, and was reduced to a bare and shattered shell. 142 Author of the ' History of the Helvetian Republics,' the ' History of Germany during the Thirty Years' War,' &c."], [53, "AND ITS LORDS. 47 There is something melancholy at all times in the aspect of a ruined budding, especially one formerly boasting of great architectural magnificence ; feelings of regret and sorrow for so much lost splendour naturally rise in our minds, even when the ruin has been gradually effected by the corroding tooth of time, and the progress of natural decay ; but our emotions are more powerful, and partake of the nature of indignation, if, as at Herstmonceux, the devastation we deplore prove to have been wanton, the result of violence rudely destroying that which would have otherwise remained unimpaired to our own time, for us to hand down to future generations. Less than seventy years ago Herstmonceux Castle displayed one of the most perfect and interesting examples of our domestic archi tecture. Built at a time when, though the means of defence were not neglected, greater consideration was paid to the comfort of the inhabitants, it formed a most important link between the fortified castle and the palatial manor-house ; partaking alike of the characteristic features of each, but per fectly corresponding with neither type, it occupied a position of great architectural importance, which no existing building adequately fids up. But bitter as must be our regret at the destruction of so noble and remarkable a building, we may feel thankful that it was not total. The outside walls remain almost complete, and have suffered but little except in the loss of some portions of the battlement, so that we are able to form nearly as good an idea of the external aspect of the Castle as if we had seen it before the hand of the spoiler was laid upon it ; and though that which has been preserved to us is scarcely more than a shell, and of the interior little exists beyond broken wads and a mass of irretrievable ruin, we are fortunate in possessing accurate representations of almost every portion of the building, enabling us to understand the form and dis tribution of the whole with nearly as much accuracy as if it were stdl existing. The views published in Grose's ' Antiquities ' and Buck's 'Ancient Castles,' are well known to every antiquary, and a still more complete series of coloured drawings was taken by Lambert in 1777, copies of which, executed by the late Mrs. Hare Naylor, were exhibited by Archdeacon Hare at the Herstmonceux meeting. Several of these, dlustrating the"], [54, "48 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX principal features of the building, have been engraved on wood, and wdl be found illustrating the subsequent pages of this memoir.143 Herstmonceux Castle stands in a very low situation, towards the southern extremity of a valley, sheltered on the east and west by hids originally covered with magnificent timber, and still preserving some remains of their wood. The valley is watered by a small rivulet, of which advantage was taken to supply the moat, as well as a chain of ponds and stews, once replenished with abundance of fish. Some of these ponds, as wed as the moat, are now dry, and form dank marshy pastures. The moat, which spread out into a large pool towards the east, was drained early in Elizabeth's reign for greater salubrity, and was formed into a garden abounding in fruit-trees, and adorned with arbours and pleached adies, all now involved in the general ruin. \" The budding,\" in the language of Horace Walpole \" for convenience of water to the moat, sees nothing at all ;\" indeed beauty or even healthful ness of situation seems to have been entirely left out of con sideration by the budder of the Castle, a circumstance the more to be regretted, as its low and gloomy position doubtless tended to alienate the affections of its possessor, and so to accelerate its ruin. The material of which the Castle is budt is brick ; and Herstmonceux has long been celebrated as one of the earliest edifices of any extent in this country erected entirely in this, which has now become the national mode.144 Bp. Littleton, in his Essay on \" The Antiquity of Brick Buildings in England since the time of the Romans\" in the first volume of the ' Arch\u00e6ologia,' 145 states that he can find no evidence of brick being employed in budding from the reign of Richard II, when De La Pole's house was budt with brick at Kingston on-Hud, till the erection of Herstmonceux Castle in 1440 ; 143 Pugin's ' Second Series of Specimens of Gothic Architecture ' contains accurate eleva tions and details of the south front, accompanied by an admirable descriptive memoir by Mr. Willson of Lincoln, to which I must acknowledge myself much indebted. 144 The earliest building known to exist in this country built with bricks resembling the modern or Flemish brick is Little Wenham Hall, in Suffolk, which is about the date 1260. (Glossary of Architecture, p. 94.) 145 Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. i, p. 147, a.d. 1757."], [55, "49 AND ITS LORDS. and mentions it as worthy of remark that the art of making brick was then \" carried to such perfection, though it should seem to be but in its infancy, that this vast structure (perhaps the largest house belonging to a subject in the king dom, now that Audley End has been in part puded down,) has stood the brunt of weather for above three [four] centuries, particularly of the salt corroding vapours arising from the sea, to which it is greatly exposed, without suffering the least in jury in any part of the wads, insomuch that hardly a single brick shows the least mark of decay.\" The bricks, which were probably the work of Flemings, introduced by Sir Roger Fienes, are admirable for their uniformity and firmness of texture, and the walls, where uninjured by violence, remain as in the time of Grose, \" without a flaw or crack.\" The only stone to be found iu the building (besides a little rude grouted work in some interior walls, which I am inclined to consider part of the materials of the old manor-house,) is in the window frames, mouldings, and battlements, the whole of which, I believe, are worked in the greenstone from the shore at Eastbourne. The Castle was originally approached in several directions by noble avenues : the trees have nearly all perished, but isolated individuals here and there exist, though probably not destined long to resist the violence of the blasts which have uprooted so many of their companions which the axe had spared. The trees which remain are mostly Spanish chestnuts, of which some most picturesque specimens, with long, bare skeleton arms, and trunks singularly twisted, stand on the western side of the moat. Others intermixed with oaks and beeches, for the most part in various stages of decay, are scattered over the undulating surface of the park, which a little judicious planting would in time restore to its former beauty : at present it is a cause of great regret to see so few young trees rising to supply the places of the noble veterans of the forest which have survived the general havoc of 1777. 146 The principal front of the Castle faces the south, looking directly to the sea. It is approached by a somewhat steep 146 The park is three miles about, the third part thereof lying in lawns, and the residue well set with great timber-trees, most of beech, partly of oak, of fair timber.

The building, as will be perceived from the annexed plans, is a regular paral lelogram, measuring 206*| feet from east to west and 214^ feet from north to south, inclosing four open courts. Each angle of the Castle is strengthened by an octagonal em battled tower, rising about 1 5 feet above the battlements of the main building, and a similar tower occupies the centre of the east and west fronts : a somewhat loftier machicolated tower, now robbed of its battlements, covers the postern-gate in the middle of the north front, and to the south rises the noble gateway tower, flanked by its machicolated turrets rising thirty feet above the side walls, forming a composition which, for its union of majesty and strength, is nearly, if not quite unrivalled. Midway between the angular and the central towers, the uniformity of each front is broken by semi-octa gonal embattled projections of the same height as the main building ; the southernmost of these, on the east front, forms in its second stage a most graceful oriel window, which gave light to the apartment known as the Ladies' Bower. The corresponding projection on the west side contained the vast Oven, twelve feet in diameter. The tower at the north-west angle, still known as the Floodgate tower, contained the reservoir which supplied the whole of the lower part of the Castle with water, conveyed in leaden pipes from a spring in the plantation on the hill-side to the north-east of the Castle, and brought over the moat in troughs of timber. Other pipes (high-service pipes, as they would now be caded) sup plied the upper floor and galleries, with an abundance very unsrequent at so early a period. The general effect of the building, in its perfect state, as viewed from the south-east, may be seen from the accom panying view, restored from the drawings of Grose and Buck, and corrected by reference to the existing building. It will be seen how much its picturesque effect was increased by the high-pitched roofs, and the forest of tall slender chimneys"], [57, "HERSTMONCEUX CASTLE, PLAN Os GROUND FLOOR.

In the same view will be per ceived the low embattled walls with which the moat was guarded, and the chapel turret, rising above the roofs, features which have now, like the chimneys, entirely disappeared. The south front is that which is usually the first to strike the attention of the visitor, and which will live the longest in his memory ; it is indeed, in the words of Mr. Willson,147 \" a noble composition, which deserves the attentive study of an architect ; the details being sufficiently ornamental to give an air of richness without impairing the character of boldness and strength proper for a castle.\" This may be said with the greatest truth of the gateway tower, which occupies the centre of the front, and from which it derives its principal character. The body of the tower is square, flanked on either side by majestic turrets rising to the height of sixty-seven feet from the level of the moat. These turrets are octagonal for above the first fifty feet of then* height, and batter or gra dually decrease in diameter ; but when they rise clear of the side walls they are corbelled out, and become cylindrical : an embattled and machicolated cornice, constructed with great boldness and ingenuity, surmounts the turrets, and is con tinued along the front of the tower between them. The whole height of the gateway, eighty feet, is completed by the slender watch-towers, springing from within the machicolated gallery, and connected with the parapet on the inner face of the tower, by a bold flying buttress, descending in embattled steps to the level of the roof, once covered with a platform of lead. The turrets are pierced with three tiers of cross loop holes, for the discharge of cross-bows, and one of circular holes, or \u0153dlets, commanding the drawbridge, for matchlock guns, which when fired required to be laid nearly level, being supported within on a kind of fork. The main body of the tower is of three stories above the moat ; the two lower are set back in a fine lofty arch, connecting the two side towers, and supporting the uppermost story, which is lighted by two square-headed windows of the common domestic character, each of two lights, with pointed heads and divided by a transom. Between these windows, in a square panel, we 147 Pugin's Specimens, vol. ii."], [62, "52 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX may stdl trace the mutdated badge of the noble budder of the Castle, the alant or wolfdog,148 holding in his paws a banner charged with three lions rampant. The wall of the two lower stories being recessed, gives room for the construction of a row of openings, pierced through the floor of the upper chamber, and covered by the lofty arch, intended for the annoyance of assailants, by pouring down upon them boiling pitch, or molten lead, as they approached the Castle-gate. Of the two stories within the arch the lower is occupied by the principal entrance, a four-centred archway, characterised by the same dignified simplicity which marks the whole budd ing; over which is a large square-headed transomed window of two foliated lights. On either side of the window two long vertical slits in the brickwork will be noticed, the purpose of which was to receive the levers of the drawbridge (which with the chains suspended from them are represented in Buck's view), when it was required to be raised. Simple as is the character of the windows in this front of the gateway, they are more ornamental than any others in the exterior of the Castle, with the exception of the three in the centre tower on the east front forming the apse of the chapel ; the ordinary type being either a long narrow rectangular opening divided by a transom, or, in the domestic apartments, where more light was required, a plain square window with a central mullion and transom. The larger openings to be seen in various parts of the Castle, especially to the north of the chapel tower, are to be assigned to a date long subsequent to the first erection, and are 143 Alandes, Alants, or Allans (Canes Alani), were names by which any large dogs seem to have been designated.

A few shattered wads, the first few steps of a winding-stair, a broken arch or two, and here and there a swelling mound or ridge speaking of the founda tion of a buttress or wall hidden beneath the verdant sod, which has spread over the whole area ; such is all that now remains of that which only sixty-four years ago was the most perfect example of the mansion of a feudal lord in the south of England. But much as we may find to regret, there stdl"], [68, "54 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX remains much to admire, for in the words of Archdeacon Hare, \" since the demolition of the interior, Nature, ' Softening and concealing, And busy with a hand of healing,' has been adorning it with ivy, which has formed beautiful thick masses around the walls and turrets. Persons,\" he con tinues, \" who have visited Rome, on entering the court, and seeing the piles of brickwork strewn about, have been reminded of the Baths of Caracalla, though of course on a miniature scale ; the illusion being perhaps fostered by the deep blue of the Sussex sky,' which, when compared with that in more northernly parts of England, has almost an Italian character.\" The porter's lodge by which we enter the Castle, forms the lower story of the great gateway tower, having immediately above it the room formerly designated the \"Drummer's Had,\" tradition having marked it out as the principal scene of the pranks of a ghostly drummer, by whom the slumbers of the inhabitants were wont to be disturbed. A recess in the wall on the left hand will be noticed, in which a chest is said to have been discovered, containing treasure to a vast amount, by which the families of a former steward and others were en riched ; with this chest the existence of the drummer seems to have been linked, and when the hoard over which, like the gryphon of old, he had been set to watch, had been ransacked, his occupation was gone, and his drum became for ever sdenced. In Grose is a view of the porter's lodge in a perfect state, showing us the vaulted roof, the springing of which, with some portion of the vaulting, still remains, as is shown in the etch ing. The porter's lodge is provided with a fireplace, on the right hand of the entrance, which Mr. Widson remarks as \" a very unusual accommodation in such an apartment,\" and on each side are arched doorways, that in the left leading into the guard-chamber, described by Grose \" as a long waste room, like a gadery in old times.\" Its rude and unfinished character, led him to the supposition that it was \" intended for a stable in case the Castle were besieged, and there were need to bring the horses and other cattle into a place of security ;\""], [69, "(\u00a77^4J^mc^^^c2Z> i0aJt^ ."], [70, ""], [71, "55 AND ITS LORDS. but it is far more probable that it was simply designed as a guard-room, in which all decoration would have been super- fluous, and the furnaces for casting bullets, still to be traced in the south wall, are an evidence of the purpose to which it was devoted. The door to the right of the porter's lodge opens through some narrow passages (in which the arrangement of .the closets and the attention paid to drainage and ventilation demand notice) into the shell of the watch-tower, now open from basement to battlement, and whose only sentinels are a crowd of noisy jackdaws, who have long since claimed these ruins as their own undisputed domain. Returning into the lodge, and advancing into the interior of the Castle, we enter the principal court, known as the Green, or Cloister court. This court, the centre of which is marked by the smad holly- tree, was surrounded by an arcade of open arches of brick, of very low curvature, quite plain, and only separated by slender buttresses, running up, as wdl be seen in the woodcut, and dividing the upper story, above the cloister, into equal compartments, alternately blank, and containing plain two-light square-headed windows, lighting the gal leries, into which the principal apartments opened. Im mediately in front, on entering the cloister, was the hall, extending along the north side of the court, at the"], [72, "THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX 56 eastern end of which rose the chapel tower, containing the clock and beds. The hall was a noble apartment, fifty-four feet long, by twenty-eight broad, and the same in height to the springing of the beams. It was lighted by four two-light square-headed windows, of the ordinary domestic type, and the roof was originally crowned by a louvre for the passage of the smoke rising from the fireplace in the middle of the floor ;> this had been removed before Lambert's view was taken. The character of the interior is wed represented in Grose's plate, from which the annexed woodcut is taken. The roof was supported on massy beams, forming a flat arch, springing from corbels, carved with the famdy badge, the alant or wolf dog. The sides were lined with wainscot below the windows, and the west end was screened off for a passage, with a gadery over it for musicians. The arched doors behind the screen led to the butteries and other offices, and the wainscot was ornamented at intervals with stags' heads and antlers. The north wall of the hall remains tolerably perfect, and the false arch of one of the windows, now reduced to a single course of bricks, hangs in a singularly precarious state, and though it would seem as if a single gust of wind would bring it down, so it has hung for very many years. Of the southern wall little more than the foundation exists, and the whole interior of this once lordly room is now over grown with a tangled mass of briers and thorns."], [73, "57 AND ITS LORDS Passing through the ruins of the hall we enter the Butler's Pantiy Court, of which a view is here annexed. It had a cloister on the north and west sides, of similar character to that in the Green Court, though the dividing buttresses were marked with set-offs, and were of a somewhat different and more graceful outline. On the south it was flanked by the hall ; and the embattled gable to the east was that of the great staircase, which was erected in the reign of Elizabeth, after the marriage of Margaret, Baroness Dacre, with Sampson Lennard, when considerable alterations took place in the Castle, with the view of adapting the principal apart ments to the style and habits of the period. A paved passage leads us from this court to the postern gate, communicating by a drawbridge over the moat with the garden and bowling-green behind. At the destruction of the Castle, a few rooms were preserved in this part of it, to form a residence for the gardener ; but these, too, have fallen into decay, and the roof, now Tottering to a fall adds to the picturesque effect of the general scene of ruin around. Turning to the right, and leaving the butler's pantry, and other offices to the left, we pass through the remains of the"], [74, "58 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX cloister, and enter the great staircase ; a square of forty feet, on the south wad of which we can still discern the marks of ascending flights of steps, together with some mouldering traces of fresco painting, from which fancy may restore the massy oaken balustrades which guarded the stairs. The ascending flights were at least ten feet wide, and the hollow formed beneath was so considerable that the smugglers who abounded in this neighbourhood in the latter part of the last, and beginning of the present century, frequently employed it as a receptacle for their contraband goods. It is said that when the clue to this hiding-place was at last discovered, and the boards of the staircase were raised, the whole cavity was found filled with tea, and that the quantity was so large that a cart was loaded with that which had been stored up there. The staircase received light from six large, square-headed windows, divided by stone mullions, and transoms, as repre sented in the last woodcut ; between these on the principal floor were large mirrors reaching nearly from the floor to the ceding. This noble staircase gave access to the numerous galleries which threaded the upper floor. The arrangement and de signation of these galleries wid be seen from the plan of this floor, which also shows us the distribution of the apartments opening from them. The principal passages of communication were the White Gallery, running east and west, and the Green Gallery, which, extending southwards from the staircase, formed the east side of the cloister court. This gallery, which took its name from its hangings, described by those who remember them as of green cloth, decorated with numerous paintings, communicated with the state rooms fitted up by the earl of Sussex in the East front, corresponding in size and arrangement with those below. One of these rooms was called the Gilded Bed-chamber, being hung, ac cording to the fashion of the time, with leather stamped and gilt, fragments of which are still in the possession of some of the older parishioners. The White Gadery formed the approach to the Library, the Private Chapel above the postern gate, and the Lord's and Lady's Apartments \u2014 the former consisting of a suite of four rooms in the north front looking on the bowling-green ; the"], [75, "HERSTMONCEUX CASTLE, PLAN OF FIRST FLOOR From aTlan in Possession of the Ven11\" Archdeacon Hare"], [76, ""], [77, "AND ITS LORDS. 59 latter of three smaller chambers on the west side of the Castle, from one of which, by means of a window opening into the kitchen below, the mistress could unobserved keep watch over her servants, or superintend the cookery without its being needful for her to descend from her own apartments. Parallel to the White Gallery to the south, ran the Armour Gallery, communicating with the chambers in the same block of budding with the hall, between the Pump and Chicken courts. It has been mentioned that the Green Gallery extended along the east side of the cloister court, the other sides were occupied respectively by the Yeoman's Gallery to the south, the Bethlem Gallery to the west, and the Bird Gallery (which was a mere open walk on the roof of the cloisters, in front of the hall) on the north. From the Yeoman's Gallery opened the chaplain's and yeoman's rooms, as well as the Drummer's Hall ; the Bethlem Gallery communicated with the Bethlem Chambers, a suite of five small rooms, each provided with a fireplace, which, it would seem probable from an example of a simdar designation in Sheen Palace, derived their name from being set apart for the lodging of strangers and wayfarers. The language of Grose's correspondent when describing this floor is worth quoting, as it is evidently that of an eye witness. \" The bed-chambers on this floor,\" he says, \" are sufficient to lodge a garrison, and one is bewildered in the different galleries which lead to them ; in every one of the windows of which is painted in glass the alant or wolfdog, the animal supporters of the famdy of Fienes. Many winding staircases, curiously constructed in brickwork, without any timber, lead to these gaderies.\" One of these newel staircases stid remains perfect to a considerable height, at the north-east angle of the gateway tower ; the stump of another, which stood at the north end of the west walk of the cloisters, strikes the eye immediately on entering the court. Let us now, in imagination, retrace our steps along the galleries, and descend the great staircase, when a few paces towards the east will lead us to the site of the Saloon, and other principal apartments on the ground floor. The saloon, which was forty feet long, and the adjoining rooms, received their first alterations from Margaret, Lady Dacre, and her"], [78, "THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX 60 husband, Sampson Lennard, in the reign of Elizabeth, who, as has been already mentioned, erected stately chimney pieces, embellished with the arms of the family and their alliances, and built the grand staircase. These apartments were still further modernized by the Earl of Sussex, in the time of Charles II, when they were sashed and wainscoted, and the panelling adorned with exquisite carvings by Gibbons, which called forth the admiration of Walpole, and even now, in their mutilated state, and most inappropriate position, in the hall of Herstmonceux Place, sufficiently prove the skdl of Grinling's magic chisel. Beyond the principal apartments, advancing towards the south, lies the Chapel, which was entered from the east walk of the Green-court cloister. Walpole speaks disparagingly of it as \" small and mean,\" and the annexed woodcut will show that it was not remarkable for any richness of architectural ornament ; but, plain though it was, the effect of the eastern oriel, with its long coupled windows, seen beneath the low arch which carries the turret"], [79, ""], [80, "GSTzZzZcU?^ %cz\u00c6&, 0OJ^Jt\u0153^."], [81, "AND ITS LORDS. 61 above, must have been so fine as to have deserved higher commendation from one whose taste, much as we may now find to condemn in it, was certainly far in advance of his age. The painted glass with which the windows were decorated, however brilliant in colour, was not particularly good in design, and the same somewhat flippant critic speaks con- temptuously of the '.'. seven long lean saints ill done,\" that remained in, the windows. Two smaller windows, lower down in the wall, which will be noticed in the woodcut, appear to have been added, to afford light to the worshippers, for which purpose also it must have been that four of the lights of the east windows were robbed of their stained glass. A square-headed piscina, of the very plainest character, will be noticed on the south side of the apse, and Walpole speaks of \" two odd cavities with very small wooden screens on each side,\" which he supposes to have been confessionals, but, as these no longer remain, we cannot say how far his conjecture was correct or no. The wainscoting about the altar, and other fittings of the Chapel, seem to have been of the same date with the great staircase \u2022 over the west end was a gallery communicating with the upper corridor. The present state of the Chapel and the side of the Castle adjacent is admirably represented in Mr. Brooke's etching. The windows on the ground-floor lighted the storeroom, the steward's room, and the servants' hall, in the former of which will be noticed an arched recess, with an orifice for carrying off water, far surpassing the piscina in elegance, though probably only serving the purposes of a common sink. The beautiful bay window in the upper story, which forms such a conspicuous ornament in the south-east view of the Castle, gave light to the Lady's Bower, which must have been one of the most cheerful and agreeable apartments in the whole building. Advancing towards the south-east, we have to guard against a somewhat precipitate descent down the staircase leading to the dungeon, which formed the basement of the tower at this angle of the front. A few years since this staircase and the passage beyond were cleared out, but since then it has been permitted to become choked up again, and access to the dungeon is now completely stopped. Grose's correspondent"], [82, "62 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX describes it as \" an octagonal room, in the midst of which is a stone post with a long chain, and in a corner of the room a door into a privy, a commendable,\" aud, we may add, most unusual and merciful, \" attention to cleanliness.\" The upper story of this tower and the rooms adjacent were assigned to the chaplain ; its highest portion, as well as that of the tower at the opposite angle of the front were left empty, and tlie walls pierced with an immense number of square openings, for the accommodation of the countless hosts of pigeons our ancestors used to keep for the purposes of their table, of which they formed one of the chief delicacies. If we now cross the grassy area of the Castle, and passing the gateway tower, place ourselves midway between it and the exterior wall on the west, we shall be standing in the centre of the Pump Court, the second in point of dimensions, but the plainest in architectural character, of the four courts con tained within the Castle. A reference to the ground plan wdl show that this court was separated from the Green Court by a narrow slip of build ings, which it wdl be seen from the woodcut was divided into three low stories, supported by massive buttresses. The ground-floor of this building (of which the very foundations"], [83, ""], [84, "C2^k^^^^^G^^^?^^%i^^ 9w\u00ab^"], [85, "AND ITS LORDS. 63 have disappeared) was devoted to offices, above which, on the upper floor, ran the suite of small bed-rooms, already spoken of, as the Bethlem-rooms. On the south side of this court was the \" long waste room \" already described under the name of the Guard Chamber, above which was a lobby communicating with the apartments on the principal floor ; to the west were the Laundry, Brew house, and other offices, the whole of this side of the Castle being devoted to domestic purposes. ' The central apartment of this front, marked by the octagonal tower, was the Bakehouse, communicating on the south with the Breiohouse ; adjacent to which, in the lower part of the semi-octagonal turret, was the great oven, in former times one of the chief wonders of the Castle, in which, ac cording to local tradition, four and twenty women once sat down to tea. The action of the fire upon the interior of the oven stdl enables us to trace its situation, and, in part, its dimensions ; but its vault and the outer half of its circum ference have been completely destroyed. By the side of the oven stood the great brewing copper, imbedded in brickwork and approached by a flight of stairs ; each step being formed of the trunk of a tree rudely squared. Above the great oven our attention is attracted by two pendentives of a brick vault (which wdl be noticed in the accompanying etching), and our curiosity is immediately roused to determine their purpose. Here both the existing ground plans, and the memory of the few old people who still recollect the Castle in its perfect state, are at fault ; but I think there can be little doubt that the object of the vault was to condense the steam rising from the brewhouse beneath, and convey it to the external air, with which it probably communicated by a louvre or central aperture. Beyond the oven were the outer and inner Laundry, above which was the \"red\" or \"unfinished room,\" so called from its remaining, in Horace Walpole's language, \" in its native brickhood \" ignorant of \" the luxury of whitewash.\" To the north of the bakehouse, which, it will be remem bered, occupied the centre of this, side, we enter the Kitchen,"], [86, "64 TH ASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX the original appearance of which is set before us in the annexed woodcut from Lambert's drawing. This room, like the hall and chapel, occupied the whole height of the house, twenty-eight feet, and contained three vast cavern-like fireplaces, with their huge chimnies projecting into the room within, and an oven, which is still to be traced at the south-west angle. It was lighted by three plain square windows in the upper range, and its wads were pierced with several openings, the purpose of which it is difficult to deter mine with accuracy. Tradition informs us that one of these apertures, on the east side of the kitchen, was furnished with chains and pullies, by means of which all the heavier joints were raised, carried along the gadery, and then lowered into the hall ; there is probably some degree of truth in the story, though it is not easy exactly to comprehend the nature of the arrangement indicated."], [87, "65 AND ITS LORDS. Immediately beyond the kitchen lay the Chicken Court, surrounded by offices, the destination of which may be seen from the ground plan, but which do not cad for any parti cular remark. This court is represented in one of Lambert's drawings, but it is not of sufficient interest to merit engraving. In its style it corresponded with the Butler's Pantry Court, but the arches of the cloister on the north were partly built up, to adapt them to the purpose from which the court derived its appedation. At its upper or eastern end a building Avith a gable the whole width of the court formed the Dairy. Having now completed our circuit of the Castle, and having endeavoured as far as practicable to present it to my readers as it existed in its perfect state, it may be interesting to peruse the lively description of Horace Walpole,149 who visited Herstmonceux five and twenty years before its ruin, to which reference has been already made. This description is taken from a letter written from Battel, Aug. 5th, 1752, to Richard Bentley, Esq., only son of the well-known Dr. Bentley, master of Trinity College, Cambridge. The letter, which it is needless to say is most amusing, though perhaps somewhat more highly coloured, for the sake of effect, than truth would warrant, details a journey from Tunbridge Weds, made by Walpole, in company with Mr. Chute, for the express purpose of seeing Battel Abbey and Herstmonceux Castle. The account it contains of the state of the Sussex roads a century ago, proves to us that, however much there may stdl be to correct, before we can shake off the opprobrious proverb which speaks of \" Sowsexe full of dirte and mire,\" there has been a greater change for the better than we have ordinarily any conception of. Leaving Tunbridge Wells, Walpole visited Bayham Abbey, whence he set out for Battel ; but before arriving at Roberts bridge he writes, \" our woes increase. The roads grew bad beyond ad badness, the night dark beyond all darkness, our guides frightened beyond all frightfulness.\" At Roberts bridge the inn was \"full of smugglers,\" so, \"armed with links and lanthorns,\" they started again for Battel, where they arrived at two in the morning, and found \"a worse inn, >\u2022\" Walpole's Letters, edit. 1937, vol. i, pp. 175-7."], [88, "66 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX crammed with excise officers, one of whom had just killed a smuggler.\" The next morning the adventurous travellers started for Herstmonceux, undaunted by the report given of the road by the natives (\"who,\" he says, \"are forced to drive their curricles with a pair of oxen,\") who represented it as \" totally impracticable.\" Happily the report proved quite untrue, and Walpole speaks of the eight [ten] miles between Battel and Herstmonceux, as \" the only morsel of good road in their whole tour.\" \" The Castle,\" he writes, \" is seated at the end of a large vale, five mdes in a direct line to the sea, with wings of blue hills covered with wood, one of which falls down to the house, in a sweep of 100 acres. The budding, for the convenience of water to the moat, sees nothing at all ; indeed it is entirely imagined on a plan of defence, with drawbridges actually in being, round towers, watch-towers mounted on them, and battlements pierced for the passage of arrows from long bows. It was built in the time of Henry VI, and is as perfect as the first day. It does not seem to have been ever quite finished, or at least that age was not arrived at the luxury of white wash ; for almost all the wads, except in the principal cham bers, are in their native brick-hood. It is a square budd ing, each side about two hundred feet in length ; a porch and cloister very like Eton College ; and the whole is much in the same taste, the kitchen extremely so, with three vast funnels to the chimneys going up on the inside. There are two or three little courts for offices, but no magnificence of apart ments. It is scarcely furnished with a few necessary beds and chairs. One side has been sashed, and a drawing and dining-room, and two or three rooms, wainscoted by the earl of Sussex, who married a natural daughter of Charles the Second. Their arms, with delightful carvings by Gibbons, particularly two pheasants, hang over the chimneys. Over the great drawing-room chimney is the coat armour of the first Lennard, Lord Dacre, with all his alliances : Mr. Chute was transported, and called cousin with ten thousand quar terirgs.150 The chapel is small and mean; the Virgin and seven long, lean saints, ill done, remain in the windows : there 150 Catherine, (laughter of Richard, J_ord Dacre, married Chaloner Chute, of the Vine, in Hampshire."], [89, "AND ITS LORDS. 67 have been four more, but seem to have been removed for light; and we actually found St. Catharine and another gentlewoman with a church in her hand, exiled into the buttery. There remain two odd cavities with very smad wooden screens on each side the altar, which seem to have been confessionals The outside is a mixture of grey brick and stone, that has a very venerable appearance. The draw bridges are romantic to a degree ; and there is a dungeon that gives one a delightful idea of living in the days of soccage, and under such goodly tenures. They showed us a dismal chamber, which they call Drummer's Hall, and suppose that Mr. Addison's comedy is descended from it. In the windows of the gallery over the cloisters which leads all round to the apartments is the device of the Fienneses, a wolf holding a baton with a scrod le roy le vent \u2014 an unlucky motto, as I shall tell you presently, to the last peer of that line. The estate is \u00a32000. a-year, and so compact as to have but seventeen houses on it. We walked up a brave old avenue to the church, with ships sading on our left hand the whole way. Before the altar lies a lank brass knight, hight William Fiennes, chevalier, who obiit M.c.c.c.c.v., that is, in 1405. By the altar is a beautiful tomb, all in our trefod taste, varied into a thousand little canopies and patterns, and two knights reposing on their backs; these were Thomas, Lord Dacre, and his only son, Gregory, who died sans issue. \" An old grey-headed beadsman of the family talked to us of a blot in the scutcheon; and we had observed that the field of the arms was green instead of blue, and the lions ramping to the right, contrary to order. This, and the man's imperfect narrative, led us into the circumstances of the personage before us, for there is no inscription. He went, in a Chevy Chase style, to -hunt in a Mr. Pelham's park, at Lawton; the keepers opposed, a fray ensued, a man was kdled. The haughty baron took the death upon himself, as most secure of pardon ; but, however, though there was no chancellor of the exchequer in the question, he was condemned to be hanged, le roi le vouloist.\" 151 151 Walpole is, of course, under a mistake here : Thomas, Lord Dacre, who was executed at Tyburn, was the grandson of the Lard Dacre to whom this monument was erected."], [90, "68 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX THE CHURCH. The last few lines of Walpole's lively narrative have already introduced us to the Parish Church, which crowns the hill to the west of the Castle. Thither let us now follow him, mounting the steep ascent ; now no longer sheltered by the \" brave old avenue \" of oaks, which seventy years since con nected the house of God with the noble mansion of the feudal lords by whose pious care it was budt and adorned, but exposed to the full blaze of the mid-day sun. As we approach the Church we cannot fail to be struck with the picturesqueness of its outline, and shad admire the judgment which placed the tower and spire at the north-west angle, in the very position to produce the greatest effect on the character of the building, and best withstand the fury of the south-west gales which are here so prevalent. The exposed situation of the Church does not allow the tower to be carried to any considerable height, and it is in fact several feet lower than the ridge of the roof, but rising as it does from the low side-aisle, its deficiency in elevation is com pletely overlooked in the north-east view, in which it assumes an importance hardly to have been expected from its dimen sions. The annexed view (for which the Society is indebted to the generosity of Mr. Petit), which presents the Church as seen from the north-west, wdl enable those who are unac quainted with the budding to judge of its character, and will show how much it is indebted for its general effect to the position of the tower. The plan of the Church is simple ; it consists of a chancel, with a chantry chapel to the north, a nave of three bays, with aisles to the north and south, the westernmost bay of the north aisle being occupied with the tower. There are porches on each side ; that to the north, which is the entrance generady used, being a modern construction of wood on the old stone basement. The material of which the nave and aisles are built is rubble, plastered over; the tower is con structed of sandstone, and the spire is covered with wooden shingles. The chancel was partly rebuilt at the time of the"], [91, ""], [92, ""], [93, "AND ITS LORDS. 69 demolition of the Castle, out of the materials which it supplied in such abundance ; the chantry chapel is also of brick, and was probably erected at the same period with the Castle, or a little later, at which time all the windows would seem to have been altered ; for though the budding is Early English, not a single window remains of that style, but all correspond with that on the north side of the chantry, which is of the ordinary square-headed Perpendicular type, of two trefoiled ogee-headed lights, surmounted by a label. The east window of the chantry is a Perpendicular supermullioned one, of three lights ; the east window of the chancel, one of the same character, of four lights, copied from the central compartment of the west window of New Codege Chapel, was inserted, a few years since, by Archdeacon Hare, in place of an ugly square-headed window, which had been put in at the close of the last century. The slope of the aisle roofs is broken by dormer windows, which, if too nearly approaching the character of domestic architecture, are certainly a great im- provement upon the clumsy garret windows with which so many of our churches have been disfigured when, as in this case, additional light beyond that supplied by the original apertures, is absolutely required. The head of the western window and the door below it have been stopped up, and the whole west end plastered, with false joints to imitate stone work, by which the effect of that part of the building has been very much injured. Within, the Church is of the simplest character ; but the beauty which is not always ensured by a profusion of archi- tectural decoration, is here in a remarkable degree the result of just proportions, and the absence of those disfigurements by which the interior of so many of our country churches are marred. When the pidars and arches were doing penance in a sheet of whitewash, which had so clogged the capitals that the foliage was hardly to be discerned, and the whole area was encumbered with pews of all shapes and sizes, the casual visitor would have seen but little to admire in the interior of Herstmonceux Church; but now that the judicious care of one to whom every stone of the building is dear, has brought out the expressive features which had so long lain hid, and, replacing the square pews by open seats of plain yet appro-"], [94, "70 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX priate design, adowed the columns to be seen in their whole height from base to capital, the general effect of the interior is one not to be easdy forgotten, especially if seen when the shades of evening are gathering around, and the last rays of the setting sun are pouring in, gdding an arch or a pdlar here and there with a brightness which only serves to deepen the gloom which is enshrouding the rest of the Church. The aisles are separated from the nave by wed-proportioned arches of two plainly chamfered orders, springing from octa gonal piers with foliated capitals. There are three of these arches on the south, but only two on the north, the _ower which occupies the westernmost bay on this side, communi cating with the Church by a lower arch of more contracted dimensions. The style of each arcade is Early English, but the foliage of the capitals renders it evident that the arches to the north are of considerably earlier date than those which correspond to them on the south, which are supported by piers of some what more slender proportions. The arches of the north aisle rest on a single pier and two responds ; the capitals of the latter are precisely similar, and are ornamented with stiff upright pointed leaves, that of the pier being surrounded with a band of large clumsy trefoils ; the execution of all is very"], [95, ""], [96, ""], [97, "71 AND ITS LORDS. rude. The capitals of the two piers on the south are of more elegant design, though stid of somewhat rude workmanship ; they are carved with smad upright leaves standing close together, turning over with a crisped head beneath the abacus : the capitals of the responds as well as of the chancel arch are simply moulded. The roof of the north aisle has evidently been raised at some period subsequent to its erection ; the moulding on the inner face of the tower shows its original height, whether the alteration was made at the time of the erection of the south aisle or when the church was gene rally repaired in the fifteenth century, is impossible to determine. The roofs are ceiled throughout, but the beams supporting that of the nave are open, and cleared from whitewash. On the north side of the chancel, opening into the chantry, stands the chief architectural ornament of the Church \u2014 the noble Dacre Tomb, whose richly fretted front reaches almost from the floor to the ceding, erected in 1534 to the memory of Thomas, Lord Dacre, and Thomas his son. This monument, from its position, presents two fronts, one towards the chancel, and one towards the chantry on the north. Both parts are similar in arrangement and in archi tectural decoration, though that to the chancel is of somewhat greater elevation. The material of which the tomb is built is the grey-shed marble, from the quarries of Petworth ; but the canopies of the niches and more delicate tracery are executed in Caen stone, and much of the carving is as sharp as when first done. The north front is in a sad state of decay, the surface of the shell-marble having, from some unexplained cause, become disintegrated ; but the rest of the monument is in fair preservation. A few years since it was cleansed from a coat of whitewash, with which it had been bedaubed by the order of a rural dean of the last century, and the coats of arms on the south side were fresh emblazoned, and the crests and mantlings partially gilt. It is much to be regretted that the ignorance of the painter employed in this good work has per petuated some false heraldry, and made the identification of the coats a matter of some difficulty. The design of this monument is of the kind so prevalent in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, consisting of an altar-"], [98, "72 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX tomb, beneath an obtusely-arched recess, surmounted by a ricldy-decorated cornice, in several horizontal divisions. The basement of the tomb is plain, the front is divided by slender arched panels into four square compartments orna mented with quatrefoils, the interior sweep and spandrels of which are most richly cusped and feathered. On the tomb, beneath the arched canopy, the soffit of which is richly panelled and decorated with colour, repose the effigies of Lord Dacre and his son, in armour, with their heads, which are bare, rest ing on their tdting helmets, and their hands joined in prayer. The arched cauopy is cinquesoded, each cusp being again foliated, and the spandrels contain trefoils subdivided in a similar manner, producing an effect of surpassing richness. It is surmounted by a flat horizontal cornice, divided into eight quatrefoiled squares, six of the compartments containing a shield, emblazoned with the arms of the alliances of the family. Above this is an embattled cornice, with which the design terminates on the side towards the chantry. The greater height of the chancel allowed the addition of two more cor nices, the lower carved with foliage, the upper divided into foliated arched panels, with intersecting tracery, the whole finished with a row of the ordinary trefoil or strawberry-leaf ornament. In front of this upper cornice are introduced three escutcheons, surmounted by the tilting helmet, mantle and crest, carved in relief, and originally richly painted and gilt ; but now ad but the centre shield are blank, and the alants which surmount two of the helmets are covered with paint of aplain stone colour. The central shield presents the arms of the Fienes family (azure, three lions rampant or), and above it the family crest, an eagle, with an annulet in his beak, or. The monument is flanked on either side by a nich of extra ordinary richness, set against the east wall. One of these is represented in the woodcut ; but it fails altogether in giving any adequate idea of the delicacy of the carving, or the extra ordinary richness of the tracery which has been lavished upon its decoration. The western angles are chamfered off and adorned with two niches, with ogee canopies of the most elaborate workmanship. Both faces of the monument are rich in heraldic decoration. Besides the Fienes coat and crest which have been already"], [99, "73 AND ITS LORDS. mentioned, the quatrefoiled cornice above the canopy contains six coats on either side: those to the north are original ; those to the south have been repainted with no great accuracy. The coats on the northern side, commencing from the west, are (1) Az. an orle of martlets or, on an inescutcheon arg. 3 bars, gules. (2) Az. three chevronels braced in the base of the escutcheon or, a chief of the 2d (Fitzhugh).152 (3) Barry of 6, arg. and az. a bend, gules (Grey). (4) Argent, a fosse, gules. (5) Gules, 3 lions, passant, gardant or, in pale.153 (6) The same as No. 4. On the south the restored coats are (7) Sable, across or. (8) The same as No. 3. (9) The same as \u2022No. 4. (10) Quarterly or, and gules an escarbuncle sable.154 (11) Barry of six, argent and gules. (12) iVzure,a fosse, gules.155 The coat (No. 7) is also repeated in the centre of one of the quatrefoils in the basement on the south. Beneath the flanking nich in the chantry is an escutcheon, Vair, the coat of the family of Filiol.156 From the wid of Lord Dacre it appears that this stately monument was erected not only to commemorate himself and his son, but also for the purposes of an Easter sepulchre. This, as is well known, was the spot where the ceremonies typifying the burial and resurrection of our Lord, prescribed by, and still practised in the Romish Communion, were annually performed on Good Friday and Easter Day. For this purpose an arched recess was often formed in the north wad of the chancel above a low altar-tomb without inscrip tion;157 at other times an actual tomb was used for these ceremonies, as in the instance under consideration, and in 152 The mother of the Lord Dacre to whom this tomb was erected was Alice, daughter of Henry, Lord Fitzhugh. 153 The arms of Holland are the same as these, within a bordure arg. Sir Roger Fienes married Elizabeth Holland, but her arms are given as azure semee of fleur-de-lis. 154 This is probably a mistake of the painter for quarterly vert and or, in centre a mullet sable, which was the coat of Lord Berners, into whose family Lord Dacre married. 156 False heraldry ; the coat was probably the same as No. 4. 156 It is a matter of great regret to me that I have been able to identify so few of these coats with affiances of the Fienes or Dacre family. Others, it is hoped, will be more fortunate. a< The sepulchre was sometimes decorated with rich tabernacle work and sculptured figures, illustrative of the Resurrection, as at Heckington, Lincolnshire, and Northwold, Gloucestershire. (;."], [100, "74 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX Milford church, Suffolk, where the tomb of John Clopton (who died in 1497) formed, like the Dacre tomb, under an open arch pierced through the north wall of the chancel into the chantry beyond, was employed as the sepulchre.158 The fabric of the sepulchre itself, which was of painted wood, was taken away from the recess shortly after Easter, so that no vestiges of it remain, either here, or in any other instance. A recess consisting of a septfoiled arch, supported on shafts and capitals of early decorated character, will be seen in the wall of the south aisle, towards the east. There is neither date nor trace of inscription to aid us in determining its purpose, and a shield which is carved in the head of the arch is blank. The only other antient memorial in the church is the noble brass to Sir William Fienes, to which allusion has already been made. It is of very early date, and remarkably fine workmanship, and though somewhat mutilated, in a very fair state of preservation. The effigy of the knight in complete armour, with his feet resting on a lion, stands under a richly crocketted ogee canopy crowned with a finial, springing from slender buttresses terminated with pinnacles. Four coats of arms adorned the slab, but they have all been removed. The inscription, when perfect, ran as follows : \u2014 William jFfienles159 \u0152ijtualev qg morust le ibiij jour be Sancber Tan bel Incarncon tux [Seigneur] 3Ijeu Crgst mccccb gist geg [IBieu oe sa alme egt mercie] qg pur sa alme beuostement pater noster et Sbe priera bj11 jours be parbon rn auera. The font in which Sir Roger Fienes, the builder of the Castle, was baptized, more than four centuries since, still stands under the westernmost arch on the south side. It is of plain decorated character, the square basin supported on 158 Bloxam's Monumental Architecture, p. 176. 169 The orthography of this name is very various : it appears under the forms \u2014 Fienes, Ffienles, Fynes, Fenes, Fenys, Fenles, Fendles, Fiesnes, Fisnes, Fesnes, Fyesnes, &c."], [101, "75 AND ITS LORDS. octagonal shafts, and a larger cylindrical pillar in the centre. The basin is leaded within. There is a trefoded aumbry of plain character in the north wall of the chancel, but there are no existing traces of any piscina in the church."], [102, "76 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX A very small shadow recess, trefoiled, with an ogee head, occurs by the side of a squint or hagioscope opening from the north aisle into the chancel. It is difficult to conceive its purpose. Another squint communicates between the chantry and the chancel to the west of the Dacre tomb, but both are now blocked up. The only vestiges of antient painted glass remaining in the church are some fragments of the Evangelistic symbols in the east window of the chantry. The heads of the lion and the eagle, and part of the name JKarcuS are still to be observed. The interior dimensions of the church are \u2014 nave, 47 feet 2 inches long, 19 feet broad; chancel, 29 feet long, 18 feet broad; aisles, 12 feet broad. Total length, 76 feet 2 inches; breadth, 43 feet. The principal object of the present memoir \u2014 the descrip tion of the Castle and Church of Herstmonceux \u2014 has now been brought to an end ; but it would be felt to be an un pardonable omission, especially by all who were present at the Annual Meeting in 1850, if I were to close this paper without some mention of the noble old barn beneath whose spacious"], [103, "77 AND ITS LORDS. roof the Society found shelter from the pitiless storm which interfered so greatly with the proceedings of that day, and partook of the good fare so bountifully provided for them. The size and antiquity of this barn mark it out as an object of great interest, and no one of the company who dined in it on the occasion referred to, is likely ever to forget the wonderful beauty of the effect of its dimly-lighted interior, richly decorated with flowers and evergreens, and thronged with the crowd of visitors, whose arch\u00e6ological zeal not even the drenching rain had been able to damp. The barn is separated into a nave and side aisles by heavy wooden pdlars, supported on longitudinal sills, and bearing arched trusses to carry the beams of the roof, and thus has a rude likeness to the interior of a church. It is divided into seven, or, including the extremities of the aisles, which are carried round the ends of the budding, nine bays. The width of the bays of the nave is twenty feet, the return of the aisles seven feet, making the entire length, from end to end, one hundred and fifty-four feet. The width of the nave is twenty two feet, the entire width, taking in the aisles, thirty -nine feet. The barn is built of rubble-work, supported with plain sloping buttresses ; but the western wall, having fallen into decay, has been replaced by wood. The wads are very low, and contain in each bay a small triangular opening, to afford light to the interior. The roof is hipped, and covered with thatch. The date of the building is uncertain, but I should be inclined to place it not later than the end of the four teenth century. Loophole in Gateway"], [104, "78 THE CASTLE OF HERSTMONCEUX APPENDIX.

The same gate and towers have portholes, emboed under the embattlement, for casting stones and other defensive engines for defending the same gate ; the said gate and towers being defective, of separations of the embattlement thereof, and the watch-towers wasted of great length, with violence of wind and weather, needful to be seen unto. Within the entring of the gate is a fair room, vaulted, of . . feet broad and . . feet long.

The other two courts on the other side are for the kitchen, bakehouse, brewhouse, and other necessary houses of offices, which standeth on the west quadrant of the said house, being well served with fair water, conveyed from a spring, over the mote, in troughs of timber. The same house is built castle-like, in a quadrant, as before, having at every corner one fair tower, covered with lead, of six square, four stories high ; and also between every of the same corner towers there is one other tower of like building, leading to the leads and embattlements ; whereas there are walks to pass round about the same house and quadrant ; and at the north side of the same house there is a draught-bridge over the mote aforesaid of . . feet broad and . . feet long, leading towards an arbour and orchard, walled about with brick, which is . . feet square, wherein standeth a fair pile of brick, of four stories high, covered with slatt, having a round tower leading to the said stories, the lower part being fairly glazed, which hath been used for a banqueting-house ; and at the north-east corner of the said arbour there is one other building, sometimes used for a washing-house, &c, the house having a fair prospect towards the sea, and the Castle and Level of Pevensey on the south ; the other three parts thereof are environed about with hills and woods, parcel of the said park. The said park standeth in the east side of the Church of Herstmonceux, the manor-place being in the same park, not distant above two furlongs from the said Church of Herstmonceux, the said park being three miles about, the third part thereof lyeing in lawns, and the residue well set with great timber trees, most of beech, and partly oak, of fair timber.
