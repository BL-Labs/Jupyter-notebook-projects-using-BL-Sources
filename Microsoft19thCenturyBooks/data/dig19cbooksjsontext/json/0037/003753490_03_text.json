The princess was a popular character in Mentone. Most frequenters of continental opera-houses had known her as a much admired singer, and most of those who had known her then were inclined to believe that in the brief and tragic story of her married life she had been little to blame. vol. in. B"], [12, "2 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. The Russian prince, her husband, had been dead a year ; he had left her very well off, and she speedily proved that her troubles had not incapacitated her for the enjoy ment of life. She had settled herself in Mentone, and after a very brief period of mourning pro ceeded to make the most of her wealth and her liberty. She was a Bohemian to her finger tips, and the society she gathered round her was essentially Bohemian ; but it was more or less, more rather than less, she flattered herself, respectable, according to her standard of respectability, which was not exactly that of the proverbial British matron. She was a fine-looking woman of about forty, of a somewhat coarse type of beauty, very good-humoured in expression and rather loud in manner. On this evening, most of her guests were"], [13, "3 STORMS. playing cards, for what stakes she did not care to enquire. She herself Avas lolling in the corner of a big sofa laughing and talking a little boisterously to a youthful German count Avho sat beside her, and Avho seemed to take the roses on her faded cheeks for natural ones, and to find a fas cination in her unconscions liquifaction of his native gutturals. Many of the company Avere smoking. The princess herself held a cigarette in her fingers, and took an occasional Avhiff from it. Suddenly she sprang up, and flung her cigarette into a silver dish that lay on a table near her. A lady and gentleman had just entered by the door at the far end of the room, and a gleam of unusual interest came into the princess's black eyes at the sight of them. Heedless of the remonstrances of her German friend, b 2"], [14, "4 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. she adA7anced quickly doAvn the room to meet the \u00bbeAV-comers. ' Ah, Mr. Lyndhurst,' she said, holding out her hand to Rupert, ' I began to think you were going to break your promise.' She had assumed something of the air of a great lady, and she spoke in much softer and more refined accents than she had used in con\\7ersation Avith the German. It Avas, hoAveA'er, not quite in the tone in which one speaks to a great lady that Rupert answered her. ' Does anyone ever venture to forget a promise he has made you, princess ?' She took no notice of his words. She Avas looking at Dolores AA7ith puzzled interest. ' Al Ioav me to introduce my AArife V Rupert added. The princess put out her hand."], [15, "STORMS. 5 ' Mr. Lyndhurst has long promised me this pleasure,' she said, looking earnestly into the beautiful face. Dolores made some conventional reply, but no touch of interest came into her dark eyes, and her features, pale and sharp ened sadly in outline, Avore an expression of cold reserve Avhich Avould have seemed strange to those Avho kneAv her intimately. The princess gave her one more glance of intense scrutiny, and then turned Avith a coquettish smile to Rupert. ' Let us sit down and have a chat over old times,' she said, Avith a touch of malice in her tones. He had no choice but to folloAv her to the sofa Avhich the German count had iioav quitted, and take his place beside her, for an elderly Frenchman had come up to claim his Avife's attention. The princess flung open her fan and"], [16, "6 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND glanced at him over the top of it with a roguish smile. ' Have you forgotten it all?' she asked, laughing. ' You used to understand the language. Ah, Ave are married noAv, and range. Madame does not alloAv eA~en the most innocent flirtation. And quite right too. Tell me about her,' her playful tone greAV serious, she dropped her fan and sat upright. ' She is not English?' ' Yes, she is English,' returned Rupert, coldly. ' She does not look it. She is like \u2014 so strangely like \u2014 some one I kneAv once, long ago. \u2014 Ah !' The Avoman's face changed; her black eyes softened.

She"], [17, "STORMS. 7 had immediately turned to the man, and, Avith a courteous, gentle smile, offered him an apology. ' Who Avas she ?' exclaimed Princess Kovolski, turning to Rupert, AA7ith an imperious movement of her heavily-ringed hand. ' What Avas her maiden name?' ' These are questions, princess, that are not generally put to a husband so abrupt ly,' he returned, Avith almost insolent cool ness. ' HoAvever, as you are so anxious to knoAv, I Avill tell you. My Avife Avas a Miss Dare, daughter of an English gentleman.' ' And her mother ?' ' Her mother died Avhen she was born, consequently I had not the pleasure of her acquaintance.' ' And is her father dead ?' ' Her father has been dead many years. He Avas dead before I met my Avife.'"], [18, "8 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND ' Then you did not knoAv him ?' There Avas just a perceptible pause. Rupert's eyes fell involuntarily on Mr. StedAvorth's ring Avhich he ahvays Avore ; he withdrew them instantly. But the princess's quick eyes had noted the doAArn- Avard glance and its hasty withdrawal. ' No. I did not knoAv him,' he said, composedly. She touched the ring AA7ith her finger. ' Do you remember the story I told you about that?' she asked. He smiled. ' A romantic story of your attachment to a gentleman aa71io once possessed one exactly like it. Yes. But, if I remember your story rightly, he proved very un worthy of your affection. He ran away with your brother's Avife, and murdered your brother. Wasn't it something like that?'"], [19, "9 STORMS. ' Hush !' she muttered, and her good natured face greAV fierce in its intensity of feeling. ' She is like him.' 'Who is like Avhom?' he asked, Avith Avell-feigned carelessness. ' She, your AA7ife, is like Ralph Sted worth. I saAV it just iioav. When she came in, she frightened me \u2022 I almost thought it Avas Mercedes herself.

'Well?' she said, interrogatively. ' Oh, nothing,' he ansAvered, half-laugh ing.

She Avas already beside Dolores. ' Mrs. Lyndhurst,' she began again, adopting her more cultivated voice and manner, ' I am conscious of haA7ing been staring at you with most uiiAvarrantable persistency. But it is because you are so like \u2014 so marvellously like one of the friends of my youth \u2014 my country Avoman long ago in Spain.' A troubled, startled look came 0A7er Dolores' face. She glanced across the room in mute appeal to Avhere her hus band had been left standing. But he Avas already on his Avay to the room Avhere the card-tables Avere set out, and he took no notice of her glance. After that one second's involuntary pause, she said, collectedly, ' People often tell me I have a Spanish look.'"], [21, "11 STORMS ' Let us go o\\rer there and talk,' said the princess, laying her hand on Dolores' arm ; and Dolores yielded, for, under the circumstances, she had no means of resistance. It Avas very late Avhen Rupert rose from the card-table, Avith a gloomy face, and, after distributing A7arious sheets of paper containing his signed acknoAvledgments of OAving the recipients sums varying in amount from one thousand to ten thou- sand francs, approached his wife. All the guests had gone except the gamblers, and Princess Kovolski had nobody left to talk to except Dolores, Avith Avhom she seemed to have become on very friendly terms. The friendliness,. indeed, was chiefly on the princess's side ; Dolores' share being confined to a passive acceptance of her hostess's demonstrations. EAren noAv there Avas some delay before"], [22, "12 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. the party broke up. The princess had a great deal to say to Rupert, Avhile an elderly Frenchman and a very good looking, but someAvhat vacuous young Englishman, Avho, earlier in the evening, had been contending for the right to pay Dolores exclusive attention, until the stronger passion for play had allured them both from her side into the other room, iioav resumed their former amuse ment. At last Dolores could endure it no longer. She Avent up to her husband. ' It is very late, Rupert.' The princess looked at her, and there Avas something like compassion in the bright, black eyes. ' You look very tired, Mrs. Lyndhurst. Your husband ought to be ashamed of himself. I have just been telling him so'"], [23, "13 STORMS. Dolores turned her head AA7ith a slight, but unmistakable, gesture of pride. ' Good-night, princess,' she said, and moved at once to the door. On fine nights Mr. and Mrs. Lyndhurst Avere in the habit of Avalking home, and Dolores Avas already waiting, cloaked and hooded, before Rupert joined her. ' I have asked young Greer and de Regnolles to come and dine Avith us to morrow. We Avill spend an innocent evening Avith music and cheerful con\\7er sation. You aa7\u00b111 like that ?' ' Yes,' she ansAvered, brightly, ' I shall like it,' There was a pause. Then he said, ' Look here, Dolores, I'm aAvfully sorry,. but I \u2014 I really didn't knoAv we Avere going to play for such high stakes to night,' She did not answer immediately. When"], [24, "14 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. at last she spoke, her voice was cold, even a little hard. ' You mean you ha\\-e lost more money than you can pay?' \u2022 That's about the size of it.' \u2022 How much ?' He named the sum. A faint exclamation of dismay escaped her. but otherwise she maintained a com plete silence until they reached the house where thev had rooms. When he had followed her into the sitting-room, she sat down in a big chair, throwing off her hood and letting her cloak slip from her shoulders. But still she said nothing. With her hands clasped in her lap, she looked straight before her as if deep in thought and oblivious of her surroundings. Her husband opened his box of tobacco and carefully rolled himself a cigarette. Then he lit it, and, leaning his back against"], [25, "15 STORMS. the mantel-piece, began to smoke. He Avatched his Avife in silence for some minutes \u2022 then, turning to flick the ash of his cigarette into a little ash-tray near him, he said, i ' Might I ask if the enormity of my offence has struck you dumb ? If not, I should be glad at least to hear the sound of your voice.' ' I Avas considering,' she replied, quietly, ' if it Avould be possible for me to help you ; and,' she paused a moment, clasped her hands a little tighter, lifted her dark eyes sadly, but with unshrinking firmness, to his face, and added, ' I do not think it is. 'Will you explain?' he asked, con temptuously. ' Of Avhat use are explanations ?' she cried, losing her hardly maintained self control and springing from her chair."], [26, "16 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. She took one or two hasty turns up and doAvn the room, and then stopped before him, a flush on her cheek and a gloAV of indignation in her eyes. She rested one hand on the table, the other she pressed Avith a AA7holly unconscious gesture against her bosom. She made a wonderfully beautiful picture in her soft yellow drap eries, AA7ith her neck and arms bare, un adorned by a single ornament. But she Avas not the light-hearted, clinging girl AA7hom Rupert Lyndhurst had married, and he Avell understood this as he looked at her Avith a darkening broAV. ' I am your Avife,' she said. ' I never forget that. Everything that in common decency you can claim from me I give you willingly, but it is not enough for you, and I can do no more.

' I ahvays do. Help you \u2014 Avhat I can do I -will.

' Let's have no more of that,' he cried. She said no more, but took up her cloak and left the room. He looked after her AA7ith an expression that A\\7as anything but tender on his face. Then he rolled another cigarette. 1 She didn't tell me Avhat Princess KoA7olski said to her,' he presently solilo quized. ' She never does tell me any-"], [29, "19 STORMS. thing now.

The room rang Avith the shrill, SAveet, baby laughter. ' And noAv, young Avoman, that you have thoroughly exhausted your poor father, perhaps you'll alloAV him to haA7e some breakfast,' said Rupert at last. But Miss Honor did not care at all Avhether her father Avere exhausted or not, and, Avhen he tried to place her in the high chair Avhich Avas ahvays set for her at his side, she shoAved her objection to the measure by struggling and kicking vigorously.

'What nonsense it is !' exclaimed Rupert, impatiently. ' It is not nonsense,' returned Dolores, with some heat, ' Look hoAV perfectly she understands that she must obey me ! And she understands equally Avell that she need not obey you.' He could not help laughing at the tone in Avhich this assertion was made, nor pri vately acknoAvledging its truth, and, as it was certainly more comfortable to eat his breakfast Avithout Miss Honor on his knee, he offered no further protest against her subjugation."], [35, "25 DOLORES HOPES.

Avhich the greater part of her remaining capital Avas invested, had failed. She had nothing left but a feAv shares in an Ameri can Railway, Avhich brought her in about forty pounds a year, and a hundred and fifty pounds ready money in the bank. She arrived at this simple calcula tion as she sat Avith the letter in her hand, and then she smiled mournfully. So this Avas the end of the money for Avhich Rupert had married her, and curiously enough her first distinct feeling Avas one of compassion for him. What Avould he do ? It AA7as some moments before she asked herself AA7hat Avould she do ? She could not support him and herself on forty pounds a year. While she Avas still con sidering the question, Avithout having yet fully grasped its importance to herself, Rupert came in. She gave him the letter to read. He read it twice before he quite"], [105, "95 THE CROAVNING STROKE. took it in, and then he swore for some seconds before turning to her for further explanation. She briefly gave him the re sults of her oavii cogitation, at which he burst out laughing. ' Well,' he said ' it don't make much difference to me, for you have ahvays grudged me a share of your money.' She accepted the reproach in silence, and her silence effected more than speech of any kind could have done. ' I don't mean that seriously,' he said, glancing at her Avith some compunction. ' But it's deuced hard lines, you knoAv, for both of us. Luckily, I'm in funds to-day, and, if I go on having the run of luck I've had lately, Ave shall be able to live like fighting-cocks for the rest of our lives.' She sighed heavily, and shook her head.

She told her the simple truth : that, in consequence of the failure of a company in Avhich her money had been invested, she should be obliged to earn her oavii living, and would be very grateful if the princess could exert her influence in her behalf. Rupert came back to dinner moody, and evidently determined not to discuss the disagreeable question of their mone tary position. Immediately after the meal he Avent out again, and did not return till four in the morning. Tavo days passed, and nothing more con cerning their future plans had been said betAveen the husband and wife. On the third day, Dolores sat by the window Avaiting for the postman, Avhom she expected VOL. III. H"], [108, "98 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. would to-day bring her a letter from the princess. Rupert had gone out immediately after breakfast, and she had no expectation of seeing him again till long after midnight, for he had SAvorn at her Avhen she asked if he meant to be in to dinner. She was thinking very sadly and hopelessly of the future as she sat there AAraiting, shivering a little, for the December weather Avas cold, and in her husband's absence she practised the economy of doing Avithout a fire. The servant came in AA7ith a letter. ' I did not think the post had come,' observed Dolores to the neat little maid. ' It is not a post-letter, madame,' Avas the reply.

' Hoav much does he want this time, I wonder, and hoAV does he imagine I am going to get it for him?' she murmured to herself, as she sloAA7ly opened the envelope. But, as she read, her face grew pale and her figure stiffened. The letter Avas from her husband, and ran as folloAvs : ' My dear Dolores, ' I hardly think I need apologize for Avhat I am about to do.

Perhaps in the whole of Rupert's letter there AA-as no sentence that had hurt her more than that Avhich suggested her return to Honor. The princess Avent aAvay, promising to come back in a couple of days Avith letters of introduction to several managers. Do lores Avas in no hurry. She had a hun dred-and-fifty pounds in the bank to keep her going till she obtained an engagement. Almost as the thought crossed her mind, a letter from the manager of the bank AA7here her money Avas lodged AA7as brought to her. A cheque for one-hundred-and-fifty"], [118, "108 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. pounds, signed by herself, had been handed in, but there AA7as some doubt about the signature.

Rupert had forged her name, knoAving she Avould not repudiate it, and so bring dishonour on him and loss on the man to Avhom he had paid it, probably in discharge of a debt of honour. Dolores smiled as the Avord occurred to her. She sat doAvn and Avrote to the bank-manager that the cheque was all right, and that she much regretted having to close her account AA7ith him.

He has deserted me, and left me penniless. For give my long neglect of you, and extend A7our charity to me ' ? No. When the princess came again, she found Dolores in a mood of eager energy. ' I am eager to begin a life of work,' she cried. ' It is, after all, the happiest life.' And Princess Kovolski attempted no arguments. But Avhen they parted, she said, ' If you need further help, there is my address in England.'"], [120, "110 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. ' In England ?' echoed Dolores. ' Yes, in England.

Finally, after much negotiating, and after several declarations on his part that the princess Avas such an old friend of his that he did not like to disoblige her, he consented to engage Dolores to sing minor parts, and make herself generally useful.

But she had the natural conscientiousness that accompanies a great gift. She AA7as im pelled to cultivate it to the utmost possible, and every day the possibilities of culti vation enlarged their bounds before her.

Arthur Avrote her an account of his visit to Dolores at Mentone, but, beyond that, she had no neAvs of any kind of her darling. At last she became so restless that she could endure it no longer, and made up her mind to travel abroad, in the hope of meeting Dolores.

They had arrived early, and, just before the orchestra struck up, the manager of the theatre appeared before the curtain and stated that, in consequence of the sud den indisposition of the prima donna, the part of Carmen would be taken by Madame Marah Costella. The announcement, AA7hich Avas made in Spanish, and again in French, produced some murmurs of discontent amongst the audience. The curtain rose.

She Avas stunned and bewildered by the shock. Hoav came Dolores here ? But hardly had Carmen's first notes fallen on the ears of the throng, than there arose a sudden tumult in the galleries.

Then it seemed that he broke from his captors, for suddenly the door leading to the stalls burst open, and he appeared, a tall, gaunt, wild-eyed Spaniard, dressed in a ragged costume that might once have belonged to a Avell-to-do muleteer or peasant. ' Mercedes ! Mercedes !' he shrieked, stretching out his arms to the stage, and fixing his hungry black eyes on Carmen, as she stood Avell to the front in the mid dle of her first recitative. But he was pulled back in an instant,"], [132, "122 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. the door was shut, and he Avas seen no more. But his face and his cry haunted Honor, and filled her AA7ith vague terrors. Who Avas this man aa71io called on Dolores by her mother's name ? What did it mean ? A hundred surmises thronged on her brain, already confused and excited by the sight of Dolores. It AA7as some time before she collected herself sufficiently to watch the play ; but, Avhen at last she did, the thought of her darling SAvalloAved up all other thoughts. Her eyes rested Avith tenderest loA7e on the beautiful Carmen.

To Honor's old-fashioned, middle class sentiments, it Avas a terrible degrada tion for a lady to go upon the stage, and, Avhile she felt sure Dolores' motives for consenting to such degradation Avere of the purest, it hurt her more to see her there than it would have done to find her making shirts at tAvopence a-piece.

Then she Avaited, Avith sickening anxiety, through the remaining acts, hardly hear ing Mrs. M'Donald's wondering comments upon the matter. No sooner had Carmen fallen on the steps of the church, a victim to her lover's very excusable anger and jealousy, than Honor rose. ' Let us get near the door,' she said, ' so that there may be no delay.' There was very little delay. The cur tain had not fallen two minutes before the attendant brought her a message that Madame Costella Avould see her in her dressing-room at once. ' I Avill Avait for you,' exclaimed Mrs. M'Donald.

Dolores made a gesture of dissent, ' You must let yourself be guided by me in this,' Honor Avent on, speaking in the gentle, authoritative tone she had been Avont to use Avhen she had a rebellious fit in her childhood, and Dolores yielded. Honor Avent back to her companion. The theatre Avas not yet quite emptied, and Mrs. M'Donald found ample amuse ment in Avatching the departures. But she lent a sympathetic ear to Honor's hurried relation of Dolores' position, and the ready tears filled her eyes. ' Oh, yes, dear Mrs. StedAvorth. I Avill Avait any length of time for you.

'Mercedes! Mercedes!' The man rushed forward from the shadow of a doorway, and clutched Dolores by the arm. Looking Avildly and fiercely into her face, he muttered something in Spanish . A great chill struck to Honor's heart. But Dolores, though she shrank with nat ural fear from the man's touch, Avas free from disturbing memories. 'Mercedes,' he repeated, and tried to drag her aAvay. She uttered a cry for help. Some of the bystanders came to the rescue, forcing the man to relinquish his hold of Dolores.

And, once having yielded, Dolores resigned herself passively to Honor's guidance. Honor's arrangements Avere quickly made. At a considerable price she got Dolores' theatrical engagement immedi ately cancelled. She Avrote a brief account to Arthur of her finding Dolores, and her intentions concerning her; and the very next evening they, together AA7ith Mrs. M'Donald, started for England.

But she gazed about her Avith an eagerness AA7hich permitted no detail of the landscape to escape her, and over the beautiful, Avorn young face there stole a look of faint but genuine pleasure.

After a time, hoAveA'er, he became more coherent, and roused himself to gh'e Arthur a tolerably clear account of his life since he had left his wife. Briefly summed up, it Avas this. He had gone to America under a feigned name, had gam bled away in New York all the money that remained in his possession ; had then gone to California to the gold-diggings ; had had a row Avith a Mexican, who ended the quarrel by stabbing him. He had been brought to death's door by the wound, but had partially recovered ; and, dis gusted with life in America, had made his way back to England, AA'here he had arrived tAvo days preA'iously, almost penni less, and knowing himself to be dying. ' It AA7as a choice between Dolores and the AA7orkhouse,' he said, ' and I knew"], [166, "156 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAXD. Dolores would prefer my choosing her. I've been a scoundrel to her,' he added, ' but I Avouldn't have had this happen if I could have helped it.' Arthur presumed that by ' this ' he meant his becoming dependent on the hos pitality of the man he had successfully rivalled and ahvays hated. But he made no reply to the remark. When the doctor came, his verdict Avas even worse than Arthur had anticipated. ' The man is dying,' he pronounced. ' The effects of his Avound must in any case have killed him eventually, but the end has been hastened by neglect and semi staiwation.' Shocked and distressed, Arthur inquired if nothing could be done. ' Nothing, I fear,' returned the doctor, Avho had attended Mr. StedAvorth in his last illness, and knoAvn Dolores since she"], [167, "157 FORGIVEXESS. first came to Elmdene. ' Give him all the nourishment possible, and let me send you an experienced nurse. It is Avonderful Avhat careful nursing AA'ill sometimes do in these cases in the way of prolonging life. You may just manage to keep him alhe till his AA'ife can come. If it is desirable for her he should be kept alive eA7en so long,' he added, grumpily. For Arthur, knowing the old gentle man's discretion, had not hesitated to tell him the AA7hole story. ' I Avould stay to-night,' the doctor Avent on, after a pause, ' but I haAre a critical case I must Avatch through the next tAvehve hours, a case Avhere medical skill may aA-ail something. Here it can avail no thing. But I Avill look in in the morning early.' When he Avas gone, Arthur went back to the patient."], [168, "158 A WOMAX IX TEX THOUSAXD. ' He says it is all up AA'ith me,' Rupert began the moment his host entered the room. ' At least, he didn't say it, but I saAV it, if I had not known it. Send for Dolores. Send for her,' he repeated, irri tably. ' You may think she Avon't come, but I knoAv she -will.' ' Of course she Avill come, and of course I will send for her,' Arthur answered. ' I should haA'e sent for her before iioav, only I do not knoAv exactly AA7here to send. I do knoAv that they did not expect to reach home till to-morroAV evening, but I haA7e no idea at all where they meant to stop en route? ' I should haA7e thought you Avould haA'e knoAvn all about Dolores' moA7ements,' said Rupert, Avith one of his old sneers. Arthur turned to him vvith flashing eyes.

I Avill not stand it for a moment \u2014 and, what is more, unless you can assure me you mean to treat her Avith proper respect Avhen she comes, I AA7ill not send for her.' Rupert laughed, and then, Avith a change of tone, said, ' Forgh'e me. What you are pleased to term my insults are but the petulance of a beaten man.' Arthur Avas a little ashamed of his out- burst of temper, and the idle threat it had betrayed him into making. He implied his acceptance of Rupert's apology by speaking in a kind, eA'en tone as he said, ' I AA-ill telegraph to the station-master at DoA'er the first thing in the morning, and also to the manager of the hotel in London Avhere Honor generally stops. It is possible that I may catch them at one of these places.'"], [170, "160 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. But both telegrams were useless. The station-master at Dover telegraphed back to say that, so far as he kneAv, no Mrs. StedAvorth had crossed by the morning boat ; while the manager of the hotel stated that Mrs. StedAvorth had not been there, nor had she sent him any intimation that she intended to come. After this, there Avas nothing for it but to send a telegram to DeA'onshire to aAvait the arrival of the traA'ellers. As has been seen, they arrived a few minutes before the message. And noAv on this daAvning April morn ing Arthur Avas anxiously counting the moments that must elapse before they could appear.

He was perfectly conscious, and restlessly eager to see his wife. As the band of light on the horizon grew wider and clearer, and began to assume the rosy hue that heralds the sun rise, Arthur turned aAvay from theAvindoAv, and re-entered the sick-room. He had A-isited it at intervals all through the night, ' Is she coining ?' asked Rupert, eagerly, for about the fifteenth time within the last three hours. ' She Avill be here very soon now,' Ar thur replied, soothingly. ' Poor pretty Dolores ! Hoav she loved me once ! It isn't her fault that she doesn't love me iioav. By Jove !

He was silent a moment, exhausted by the effort, Avhile the nurse replaced the bed clothes over him and gently exhorted him to husband instead of dissipating his strength. Then he Avent on : ' But what Avould be the use ? I Avas always a scoundrel to her, and I should be again. \u2014 She's well quit of me. \u2014 You'll be a better husband to her, Stanton, than I ever could be \u2014 and yet \u2014 I've half a mind to make her promise neA'er to marry you.\" He fixed his large, bright, sunken eyes on Arthur's face with a gleam of malicious enquiry.

' Will you not try to compose yourself? Your Avife Avill be here in an hour-and-a-half. You must do your best to be strong enough to talk to her.'

Some undefined feeling had prevented him from going himself to the station. That last hour-and-a-half dragged sloAvly by. Mrs. Stanton AA7as dressed, and had joined her son after seeing that everything Avas in readiness for the comfort of their guests. But Rupert's voice called Arthur again into the other room. ' Why do you go away ?' he asked, fret fully. ' Stay Avith me here. Why doesn't Dolores come?

' Don't leave me,' Rupert repeated, feebly, catching for help and comfort at the hand of the man he had ahvays scorned. And Arthur sat beside the bed, and ministered to the sick man unweariedly, as if he had been his brother. There Avas a rustle in the outer room, a faint murmur of voices, and the next moment Dolores appeared, AA7hite, but re solutely calm. She stepped up to the bed quickly, but quietly, forestalling his effort to raise himself by bending over him. ' Here I am, dear,' she said, gently. ' I could not get to you any sooner.'

' It can't be much of a pleasure to you to see me.' The tears came into her eyes as, kneel ing by the bed, she stooped and kissed the AArasted hand that lay outside the counter pane. Arthur had risen AA'ith the inten tion of quitting the room, but the look of terrible physical exhaustion that pre dominated now over eA7ery mental expres sion on the features of the dying man made him hesitate to leave Dolores alone AAnth him. He had never once glanced at her, and she appeared to be, probably was, unconscious of his presence.

She dreAV from inside her dress the little miniature and held it before his eyes, but they had suddenly closed. She threAV a terrified look at Arthur, Avho quickly put the spoonful of cordial to his lips. In the momentary strength thus given to him, Rupert once more opened his eyes and fixed them Avith sad intensity on the pictured baby face. Then he spoke again.

But, as he glanced back for a second before closing the door behind him, he saAV Dolores draAv her husband's head to her breast as a mother might her child's. Outside that closed door, he and Honor sat and Avaited for nearly an hour. Then it Avas opened, and Dolores came sloAA7ly out, with a look so sad, tender, and solemn on her face that the tAvo devoted Avatchers Avere awed into a sense of great calm.

But Dolores had had no A-oice in the matter. For many weeks after her hus band's death, she lay in a condition that filled Honor Avith anxious fears. The doctors could give no definite name to her illness. It Avas the result, they said, of too long a strain on mind and body. They did not anticipate any serious ending, but the most absolute rest, and most careful nursing, would be requisite to restore her to health. For the present, at least, it Avould be impossible to move her. ' What would you like me to do ?' asked Arthur, when Honor had imparted this intelligence to him. ' I Avill go aAvay at once, abroad or anyAvhere, if you think I ought, for her sake or yours.' But he spoke very wistfully, and he"], [181, "FACING THE FUTURE. 171 looked at Honor with an expression that seemed to beseech her indulgence. She returned his look frankly and tran quilly. The cloud that had arisen be tween these tAvo seemed to haA-e been per fectly dispersed by the eA'ents of the past AA'eek. Dolores stood once more both a link and a bar betAveen them, and in that common absorbing interest their passive friendship became once more an active one. Honor never pretended to herself that she did not love him still ; indeed, the fresh reA'elations of his character the last feAv days had brought her, had aAvakened to intense life the passion that had latter ly slumbered. But she thankfully recog nized that he was no longer practically conscious of her feeling for him. He Avas thinking too much of Dolores to haA7e room for other thoughts. ' I do not think you need go abroad,'"], [182, "172 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. Honor said, after a moment's consideration. ' People have never,' she spoke quite naturally, ' coupled your name and hers. \u2014 It AA7as only a jealous fancy of Rupert's \u2014 She, remember, does not knoAv. She never kneAv. You had better stay. To begin Avith, you cannot Avell be spared from the business just now, as I shall have no time to attend to it.'

It would be hard to turn you out of your oavii house. Of course I shall take Do lores aAvay as soon as she can be moved. \u2014 Dear Arthur,' she held out her hand to him, ' it is not generally seemly to allude to such possibilities so soon, but the cir cumstances in this case are peculiar.

Honor stood beside the window, looking out but seeing nothing, for the tears Avere rolling down her cheeks. She realized iioav that she had hoped, and her hope Avas killed once more. There Avas no stormy passion attending the burial of this second wholly unauthorized hope, only bitter pain. But she soon dried her eyes, and Avent back to Dolores' bedside with a cheerful face. The dark eyes opened, and looked up at her as she stood for a moment looking doAvn on her patient, but Dolores did not speak. She had hardly spoken, save to murmur a ' thank you ' for any serA'ice ren dered her, since Honor had laid her in bed the morning of her husband's death."], [184, "174 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. ' Is there nothing I can do for you, dearest? Are you quite comfortable?' Honor asked her, presently. ' Quite comfortable,' returned Dolores, wearily. ' I only want to rest \u2014 I am so tired. I am glad to die.' ' You are not going to die,' returned Honor, Avith gentle decision, though her heart sank, ' you are all I have in the world \u2014 and you must lh7e for my sake.' Whether it were in answer to this ap peal, or from naturally returning A'itality, it is certain that from this time Dolores began to mend. Her recoA-ery Avas slow, but sure. She began to notice Honor's mo\\7ements about the room, to stroke Gib's head AA'hen he put his paAvs upon her bed, to smile over the floAvers that Avere brought daily to her room. Both Gib and the floAvers Avere due to Arthur's thoughtful ness. He gathered the daffodils and prim-"], [185, "175 FACING THE FUTURE. roses and bluebells that Honor carried to the invalid, and it Avas he Avho had insisted on Gib being sent for. ' He will make it seem more homelike to her,' he had said. So Gib was despatched from his Devon shire home, carefully packed in a hamper, and accompanied by many injunctions to railway porters and guards as to his treat ment by the Avay. But Gib refused to re gard the proA7ision for his comfort as any compensation for the indignity offered him in shutting him up in a hamper. He Avas accustomed to traA-el loose in first-class carriages, and shoAved his resentment by being very sulky indeed Avhen he first ar rived at Elmdene. When, hoAvever, he realized that he had to keep Dolores com pany, he Avas mollified. But Dolores did not knoAv that Arthur stood in the background, and planned"], [186, "176 A AVOMAN IX TEX THOUSAXD. everything that Avas done for her. She seemed almost to have forgotten his exist ence. But Avhen at last she Avas Avell enough to be carried doAvnstairs for a feAv hours every day, and Honor asked her if she should object to Arthur's performing that office, she smiled at the question, and said she thought it Avas rather for him to object, When he came to lift her from the sofa Avhere she lay, dressed for the first time in her widow's weeds, their mutual greeting Avas as calm as if they had met uninterruptedly every day since her child hood. To Dolores, indeed, it seemed natural to take up the old relationship Avith both Honor and Arthur, Avhere she had dropped it. The past that had come be tween them AA-as buried for ever, at least so far as they Avere concerned. She had no suspicion of the Avild tumult of feeling that agitated Arthur's breast as he carried"], [187, "FACIXG THE FUTURE. 177 her sloAA-ly and carefully down the stairs, and she thanked him Avith the innocence of a child. For many days she saAV but little of him. She supposed he had his Avork to do, and that it bored him to sit still in the draAving room talking to her. But on the eA7ening before the day which Avas finally fixed for hers and Honor's departure, she sent him a message that she Avould like to see him. He obeyed the summons, and found him self alone Avith her. She Avas lying back in a Ioav chair near the AA7indoAv, looking out on the June sun set, Hoav often he had seen her on by gone June evenings, perched on that win dow-sill, singing to her guitar.

The knowledge of his feeling for her came to her finally Avith a rough shock. A village concert Avas being held at Ribblescombe.

' I Avill remain here,' Honor said, ' and try to keep order. You go to Dolores. There is a door at the back, if it is not locked.'

He thought she Avas suffocated by the smoke, and in an agony of grief he clasped her in his arms, exclaiming aloud, ' My darling ! my darling !' as he hurried with her toAvards the back of the building, where the other door Avas situated.

She started on her AA7alk the folloAving morning, Avith sandAviches in her pocket, and leaving behind her the assurance that she should probably not be back till four o'clock.

' Let us strike another match, dear,' said Arthur, quietly, but Avith the tenderness one uses to a sick child, releasing his hand from his companion's hold. The light of the match revealed that the Avhole of the roof and sides of the passage just in front of them had fallen in. Be hind them, hoAvever, all was clear.

But Gomez in his OAvn rough Avay had been a kind brother to her, and when she learnt his pitiable condition she lost no time in seeking him out, and taking him under her OAvn care.

It Avas something of a shock to her to find Mrs. StedAvorth living close by.

She thought a little care Avould prevent Gomez from eArer seeing Mrs. Lyndhurst. She believed she had ac complished this, but iioav understood that the cunning of madness had outAvltted her. Her brother had seen Dolores, he had seen Arthur Stanton frequently.

She made a very slight movement to- Avards him, AA7hen Gib rushed back to her, whimpering Avildly, and begging her, in his unmistakable fashion, to open the window.

THE AWAKENING OF MARY FENWICK By BEATRICE WHITBY. \" We have no hesitation in declaring that ' The Awakening of Mary Fen wick ' is the best novel of its kind that we have seen for some years. It is apparently a first effort, and, as such, is really remarkable. The story is extremely simple. Mary Mauser marries her husband for external, and per haps rather inadequate, reasons, and then discovers that he married her because she was an heiress. She feels the indignity acutely, and does not scruple to tell him her opinion \u2014 her very candid opinion \u2014 of his behaviour. That is the effect of the first few chapters, and the rest of Miss Whitby's book is devoted to relating how this divided couple hated, quarrelled, and finally fell in love with one ai ot ler. Mary Fenwick and her husband live and move and make us believe in them in a way which few but the great masters of fiction have been able to compass. Their modifications of character follow one another naturally and almost imperceptibly, and at the end of the story they are still unmistakably the same couple as we began with, modified but not altered by their curious experience of wedded life. It is a most artistic piece of work. The minor personage i also have each a clearly recognizable individuality. Mrs. Holland must have been drawn, or, let us hope, carica tured from life.

The tone of the book is absolutely fair and just, and the good qualities of both parties are done justice to. Not that politics as such do more than form a background for the sweet figure of Mistress Beatrice, one of the simplest, most charming, tender, and heroic maidens of fiction There has not been so pretty a book, or one fuller of all wholesome and good sentiment, written for girls' reading, while it is equally suitable for all those who love a good story well and dramatically told, which gives a life-like picture of the end of the most stirring and heroic period of our national history.\" \u2014 Queen.

Mrs. Alexander is certainly not among those who need find her self in want of a plot at once interesti ng and wholesome, to judge from the freshness and novelty of the ' Crocked Path ' to which Katherine Liddell found herself committed. Starting from a point so common as the suppression of a will, the reader before long finds himself following her into the least ex pected yet the most natural developments, reaching poetical justice at the end by equally natural and equally unlooked-for means. The portraiture is in variably adequate, and the background well-filled ; and, when it is unneces sary for a personage to come to the front, or to rise to the requirements of a situation, the demand is always met in such a manner as to seem as if, in spite of the elaboration which the plot must have received, situation were the result of character, and not character of the exigencies of construction.\" \u2014 Graphic. \" The title of ' A Crooked Path ' is certainly suggestive of wrong-doing of the subtle and crafty sort.

His portrait of Mahme Nousie, with her Southern beauty prematurely faded with trouble and hard work, and her stout form decked with the gaudy colours which are tho instinct of every creature with negro blood in its veins, is faithful as well as touching. Like all her race, she is a being of one idea, and that idea is her child. To keep her away from the island, to have her brought up as a lady and given the best that money can give, it is for this that Nousie has opened a cabaret for the negroes and has sat at the receipt of custom herself. Of course she never once thinks of the shock that the girl must undergo when she is plunged suddenly into such a position, she never thinks about anything but the fact that she is to have her child again. Her gradual awakening, and the struggles of both mother and daughter to hide their pain, are\u00bbfinely told. So is the story of how they both remained ' faithful unto death.' Mr. Manville Fenn knows the kind of people he is writing about, their passions and their virtues, their gross super stitions, and the patience with which they will endure all things for those they love. His story will therefore have a power to chann, which is often lacking in tales of higher pretensions.\" \u2014 Saturday Review. THE IDES OF MARCH By G. M. ROBINS.

PART OF THE PROPERTY By BEATRICE WHITBY. \"The book is a thoroughly good one, its only noteworthy defect being a certain want of ease in some of the conversations which are a little too elabo rate, too literary, and wanting in the light turns of true colloquy. The theme of the book is a fairly familiar one, \u2014 the rebellion of a spirited girl against a match which has been arranged for her without her knowledge or consent ; her resentment at being treated, not as a woman with a heart and will, but as ' part of the property ' ; and her final discovery, which is led up to with real dramatic skill, that the thing ag ainst which \"her whole nature had risen in revolt has become the one desire of her heart. The mutual relations each to each of the impetuous Madgo, her self-willed, stubborn grandfather, who has arranged the match, and her lover Jocelyn, with his loyal, devoted, sweetly balanced nature, are portrayed with fine truth of insight ; but perhaps the author's greatest triumph is the portrait of Mrs. Lindsay, who, with the know ledge of the terrible skeleton in the cupboard of her apparently happy home, wears so bravely the mask of light gaiety as to deceive everybody but the one man who knows her secret.
