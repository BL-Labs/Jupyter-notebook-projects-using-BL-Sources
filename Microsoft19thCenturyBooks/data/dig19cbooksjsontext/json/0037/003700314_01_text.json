What said the wise man in his irony ? \u2014 \" Rejoice, O young man \u2014 but for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.\" What in his gentleness ? \u2014 \" Remem ber now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.\" What have our poets not sung, and our philosophers not taught ? The one tells us to save our youth, and put it to an enduring profit ; while the other contradicts him flatly, and urges us to lavish our spring-time, that we may drink to the full the cream of earthly enjoyment \u2014 that veriest \"foam-bell on the river.\" How many chapters"], [16, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 4 in life are to this day headed with old Herrick's lines, \" Gather ye rose-buds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying ;\" making sad the Christian hearts which cannot un derstand them in a wide sense. For there is a sense which unites the poles, the spending and the sparing, the bright and the sedate. But however we may read these advices, there is no greater mistake than to suppose that youth is necessarily the choice period, the green spot of life. To some it has not even the buoyancy and light heartedness which is its ordinary portion. To not a few, cares and trials come while the frame is yet in its fresh vigour, and the eyes are sparkling with their first bold, blithe look out on the world. To almost all, youth is a power which hurries them to its goal ; the young heart is \" hot and restless ;\" it will not take time to appreciate its treasures ; it will not be satisfied with its goodly possession ; it is full of uncertain desires, and wayward inclina tions, and passionate impulses ; it is grasping and straining and striving after a vague, uncompre hended good, an airy or ornate, ill-proportioned ideal ; it is troubled with its ignorance of its own destiny, its unresolved will, its undeveloped cir cumstances. Youth is not often the cycle of peace. Do not fear then, young girls, to leave behind you the gaily-jested -over or mincingly mentioned epoch of your teens. Do not dread"], [17, "Youth 5 growing graver or even stouter. With ripe wo manhood, and the still, mellow decline of life are won, and often and often only then won, rest, power, wisdom, content. There may be a great garner in store for your future, there will be an abundant harvest if you will but sow in grace. It is a half pagan, and wholly untrue notion, to associate all blessedness of existence, with rash, heady, crude youth. Fight the fight, and run the race, and the older you grow the more royally you will prove the conqueror, and the grander will prove your prize. But the important question now is, how to em ploy this youth so as to make of its notes some of the sweetest and gladdest of the melody which be gan softly in the cradle, and which, if not drowned in the clang and discord of idol music and devil wor ship, should swell until it joins the chorus of the skies. The writer supposes herself speaking to those who are very weak, very unstable, very err ing, very imperfect, as she is ; but who are in earnest, as even girls can be in earnest, about Christianity and their duty ; who would con their lesson and practise their calling humbly, modestly, perseveringly to the end. She is aware from ex perience that not a tithe of girls of a contrary spirit would listen, even from curiosity, to these papers ; and they do not consequently come within the scope of her argument. Only to them she would say, once and for all, solemnly, wistfully, and affec-"], [18, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 6 tionately, it is a piteous sentence which they are preparing to pass on themselves \u2014 to refuse to come to the Father for life, the Elder Brother for love, the Holy Spirit for light. Idleness, disobedience, and rebellion, unless great mercy interpose, must sow the wind to reap the whirlwind. \" I do not know what I shall do with myself after I leave school,\" says many a good girl, doubtfully and regretfully. She need not be ashamed of the difficulty ; her position is a pro blem of the present day. How to train the facul ties of women, to gather up and employ their energies, how to provide for them a quiet and noble sphere, at once consistent with their de pendence and their dignity, how to furnish with suitable objects the disengaged capacities and ac tivities of mature single women, are considerations engaging a host of the great and good \u2014 enough with a blessing to bring women's affairs to a happy issue. The solution is not found, but it may not be distant. The advices run in this direction : \u2014 Shall the girl return to the pickling and preserving, the herb-gathering and doctoring, the primitive housewifery and sempstresship of her great-grand mother ? Shall the Protestant girl borrow a lesson from Catholic humanity, and, while she abjures asceticism, enthusiasm, and unnatural vows, be come a deaconess instead of a sister of charity, have her role regularly laid down, of teaching the ignorant, nursing the sick, feeding the hungry, and"], [19, "Youth 7 clothing the naked ? Or, shall she discover her bent like a boy, pursue her profession fearlessly and innocently, achieve independence, and from her own lawful earnings endow and cheer her own dear home, and let the rays from that centre of love and charity stream forth on every poor, stinted, burdened, desolate home on earth ? Probably the answer lies in a union of the whole three \u2014 in domesticity, alms-deeds, and independence, woven into a Christian crown. But, at the outset, keep in mind the follow ing data. While thoughtful men are pondering women's questions, let girls show that they have not made their petitions in self-conceit. Let them remember that women themselves have laboured to impress upon them that \" the woman's head is the man.\" Let them not forget that the great apostle would not suffer women to usurp autho rity ; that at fathers' and brothers' and husbands' feet they should sit so loyally and willingly, resting their heads on their knees, taking them as their masters \u2014 the representatives of the Great Master \u2014 and learning of them the truth in submission. Let girls especially, while conflicting opinions are at work, think more of their duties than their rights. Woman's rights ! Foolish women have made the words a scandal in the ears of the com munity. True and tender women in their in tegrity and delicacy have revolted at the term, and avowed they had enough, they had what they"], [20, "8 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. would, they were satisfied, they felt their lots were in their own keeping; they would have none of such bold, boisterous, bragging advocacy. They sympathized with good old Mrs. Grant of Laggan, when she wrote, \" I have no ambition to hear thc modern belles declare their ' dark sayings on the harp,' till such time as I am convinced that they stay more at home, have less vanity, and make better wives and daughters than formerly.\" It is a great fact, that under Providence a girl's lot is comparatively in her own hands. She may not have the clearness, the conviction, or the satisfaction which she might enjoy from a direct road in life plainly set before her, and a busy heart, head, and hand improving its rough places and its smooth ; she may sigh, long, pray, after what would be at once greater guidance and greater freedom ; but all things that are essential to her safety and happiness are hers. When her poor little head is puzzled with doubts and distrac tions, when her brothers and cousins laugh at her wants and distresses, and tell her that a woman should only be ornamental, that the more useless she is the more she is answering their sense of fitness, that a strong-minded woman is an anomaly, and therefore the weaker-minded she proves the better for her and every one connected with her ; when one friend is all for meditation and endurance, and another for reform and activity ; when one speaks out her experience, and another veils it to her last"], [21, "louth 9 breath, \u2014 let the little one escape from the labyrinth by thinking not of herself, by doing what is nearest and simplest to her hand, by living as much as possible in the wellbeing of others. The intri cacies of artificial life will never entangle and confound her more than she is able to bear. The ram has been caught in the thicket that will atone for her errors, as well as for her sins. If it be the Divine will that compulsory waiting and irregular working, which men so largely ordain for women, should last as long as the universe, if actually the rule is irreversible and unavoidable, and men are as innocent of it as women themselves, neverthe less let her lift up her head, for her redemption draweth nigh. The secret of happiness here and hereafter, the gold thread of youth, lies in loving God and loving our neighbour, loving them early if it be yet pos sible, loving them well ; losing one's own life in theirs, becoming guileless and docile, meek and reverent in our intercourse with them, loving them long, yea, for ever. These Papers are written with a diffident but yearning wish to aid young girls in their aim at so lofty and beautiful a con clusion. They are intended to steady their views, to comfort and confirm them, to help them (in weakness) in trying to contemplate by the broad light of God and the gospel, some of the things which are before them. These things consist of those gifts and faculties (in which youth is in-"], [22, "Papers for Thoughtful Girts. 10 eluded) that necessarily and inevitably occupy much of their notice ; those pursuits which form part of the nurture and growth of the soul ; those stumbling-blocks which beset their road ; those encouragements which will enable them to lift holy hands, without wrath or doubting, which will preserve them our own bright, trusting, eager, joyous young people, till God shall please to lay upon them the responsibilities and the labours of more advanced years. OUR SISTER GRIZEL. Two hundred years ago, down in the south of Scotland, stood an old turreted house, the home of a country family of rank and consequence. It was a grim enough dwelling, nevertheless, with slits of windows, high, steep roof, and low, battered door. The pleasure-ground was limited to a neglected herb-garden, which closely adjoined the church yard of a homely little parish church, so that the farm-yard and poultry-yard presented the liveliest attractions of the policies. The whole aspect of the house was bleak ; and within its damp-stained lichened walls reigned strict discipline, heavily over clouded by family reverses, troubles, and dangers. It was a hard home for a fanciful young girl, yet"], [23, "Youth 11 here was born, grew, and flourished our sister Grizel. The chill east wind swept blightingly around her, and pinched the very elder-bush by the kirkyard wall, but Grizel and the blue-bells flourished notwithstanding. Her diet of catechism and unquestioning obedience was as ample as her diet of cake and pudding was scant, but Grizel throve upon them both, grew up straight-backed and open-faced, and sang as she span at her wheel. Fortunately for Grizel, she was not the only child of engrossed parents, or of those stern, rough, but upon the whole, not unkind servants. She had many brothers and sisters, and probably they were her benign safeguards against austerity and fanaticism ; yet it is well-nigh impossible to ima gine Grizel growing up morbid and harsh under any circumstances. If all our girls were but as hardy and affectionate as Grizel ! In these two qualities, quite as much as in her tender imagination, lay her double success. Which of our girls has a home so barren of comfort, indulgence, and spright liness, so burdened with sorrow as Grizel's ? and yet Grizel's youth, like her age, was bountiful in benevolence and joy. We warrant Grizel rose with the lark, and like the lark was made glad by the mere stinging fresh ness of the early morning. Grizel did not grudge her morning prayers, she only grieved that she was not always so hearty in her petitions as she should have been. In order to relieve her weary, down-"], [24, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 12 cast mother, Grizel presided over the thin porridge and blue milk, for even in the country mansion the distress was so great that the daily provisions were scarce. She dispensed the doles with the most upright exactness, soundly cuffed the little brother who helped himself to an additional spoonful with out her permission, but took the baby sister in her lap and fed her out of her own dish. How pretty it was to see Grizel in the flaxen-haired, bright cheeked fairness and bloom of her twelve or thir teen summers, holding the year-old baby, coaxing it to open its cherry of a mouth, slowly and care fully shovelling in the portion of well-mixed por ridge and milk, and drumming the baby triumph antly on the back with the handle of the spoon when the spoonful was over, in all the skilled ease and pleasure of a motherly nurse of fifty. But do you think that breakfast was Grizel's most impor tant duty, or that her lessons, and her spinning, and her attempts at household economy, and exer cises at cantering her pony under some laird's Jock, were the limits of Grizel's obligations ? A world wide of it. Never young girl had a more difficult part to play. In addition to sums in arithmetic, no longer theory but practice, and secrets which might have caused middle-aged heads to grow grey, little, sensible, spirited Grizel was trusted with feats of diplomacy which would have baffled wary, crafty statesmen. The political and religious disorder and misery of"], [25, "Youth 13 the time were very great. Grizel's parents were of the protesting, Covenanting party. Her father had been rash, and had anticipated the national constitutional rising which called in the Prince of Orange ; he had aided and abetted, and shown his person in an ineffectual northern landing. He was pursued as a rebel, while he lay in hiding, cooped up in cramps and cold behind the false boarding in a room in his own house ; and at one time he was driven to the dreadful chill and gloom of the family burial-vault in the neighbouring kirkyard. And all this while the soldiers \u2014 the dreadful \" red coats \" of the enemy \u2014 were perforce quartered on the family, and shared their stinted meals. Grizel wns not only cognisant of these facts, but she was employed as the chief agent in managing their complicated machinery. It is passing strange to us how the girl managed ; how she contrived to carry food and comfort to her father, who depended upon her principally both for meat and cheer ; how she eluded the vigilance, and diverted the attention of the soldiers. It is said she propitiated them, and what this amounted to you will know when you reflect that your bailiff of modern days, with his bad name for harshness and coarseness, is a mild fine gentleman when contrasted with the drinking, dicing, cursing soldier of Charles the Second's era. It is impossible to suppose that these bearded, gross, violent men could have been other than good-humoured and obliging to the"], [26, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 14 child, or else she would never have effected her purpose. The truth was, Grizel had a dash of Jenny Denison in her character ; the bright, bold, fearless little girl was an innocent coquette. She had ample sympathies and fine discrimination. She could understand something of the original constitution of these bluff soldiers; she had a lurk ing admiration for their manliness, befouled as it was with sin. She instinctively seized on what was left of truth and kindness in those case-hardened, corrupted hearts. And the rude, depraved men were won by the little mistress who was not frightened at them, who burst out laughing in their faces at any incongruity in the quantity of meat she first heaped upon her plate and then slipped into her apron. They knew her and spoke of her among themselves as the little greedy wench, who drank their healths (young sprig of Presby terianism as she was) over the hall table ; who stopped and asked them of their campaigns as they cleaned their belts and burnished their buckles, whistling round the front-door ; and who even sat on the kirkyard-wall, and sang to them her country songs. Grizel was always famous for her songs. If our girls could sing like Grizel, they would wile the bird from the tree. There are very contradictory opinions rife of Grizel's father. Probably he was a passionate man hard pressed ; he certainly was one of the plotters of his generation. He had small scruple in making"], [27, "Youth. 15 use of his little Grizel. He not only availed him self of her wit and energy in procuring the supply of his daily wants, but he despatched her on his difficult and dangerous errands. One can fancy that Grizel might have had little enough inter course with her turbulent, stout Presbyterian father until his adversity. Then when he lurked a sorry prisoner where he had ruled with a high hand ; when there were no more stir and strong excitement for him, but when he had to endure the dismal blank of a helpless and well-nigh hope less captivity, then he must have turned to bright Grizel, watched for her light step, listened to her prattle of her strategies, laughed his low, short laugh at her pranks, gradually talked with her as to an older person of his straits, trusted her with his desperate projects, and thought when she left him again in silence and shade, what a clever lass she was, how dutiful and devoted, not falling be hind her poor broken-spirited mother one straw's breadth. He must have wondered, with long sighs, if he would ever reach those low countries of which he talked, and sail with Grizel in those queer, flat-bottomed boats with the gay houses on their decks, or sit smoking at the windows where the fresh waving trees shaded the dusty streets, with Grizel to fill his pipe, and amuse him with her quick, shrewd observations on the passers-by. Hume of Polwarth did not hesitate on a point or two. Once, on a push, he made Grizel be for-"], [28, "16 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. warded as the bearer of a letter to his fellow-rebel and fellow-sufferer, Baillie of Jerviswoode, lying in Edinburgh Tolbooth. No doubt the occasion was an urgent one ; but think of Grizel entering the low-browed, iron-studded doors of the old Heart of Mid-Lothian, and with the knowledge of high treason perilling her father's head, and weighing like lead on her heart ; think of her stumbling in her old-fashioned sacque and screen, with her crop of flaxen hair standing on end with sheer terror \u2014 stumbling along these dismal pas sages and by the barred windows after the gruff, impatient turn-key, who rattled his huge keys, quite dead to the playful wiles which mellowed the lazy, roystering soldiers. Think of Grizel in the cell where Baillie sat in his soiled coat and crushed cravat, spelling out his Bible in the dim light, and mentally calculating what was like to be the short progress between the jail and the Grassmarket. A marvel that the carrier pigeon did not drop at his feet. Jerviswoode must have reckoned his friend at a loss for a servant, but he read, with many a deep groan and angry ejaculation, the letter in its barbarous cipher, sent with speed and care by a trusty hand, and requiring an answer to be lodged in the same innocent keeping. Another than old Jerviswoode, despondent and displeased, stared at the child as at a world's wonder. His son George, a lad of twenty and odds, looked so steadfastly at the brave."], [29, "Youth 17 intelligent face, cowed as it then presented itself, that he remembered years after, across the seas, with what reluctant, pitiful eyes the child looked on his father's disgrace ; with what implicit con fidence she placed her hand in his, the hand still rough, red, and chubby in its child's roughness, the hand that still swung bags and baskets and water ing-pans, and flung stones and flourished sticks in games with little brothers, at putting the stone and shinty \u2014 still a boyish hand even in its feminine round ness ; he remembered how she grasped his long fingers with a boy's frankness all the way back through the prison courts and passages, and how she told him, as he lifted her on to the big-boned horse at the gate, \" the bear was in braird down at Redbraes.\" The sentence sounded as if she were eager to shut her eyes on this black, beetling, noisy, inhospitable town, and shut out with it all thoughts of men's scrapes and men's rage and an guish, and open them on the green fields of her years and sex. Unless in rare instances, Grizel held that capa city of looking up from the miry earth straight into the clear sky all her life long, and these instances when Grizel's courage and cheerfulness failed her only bring her more home to our hearts.

No wonder, Grizel. What could the faithful fondness, the acute wit, the unflinch ing endurance, work against the last enemy ? all baffled, all lost there. When the yellow fogs travelled on sluggish wings across the damp flats of Holland, and clasped with a chill, tight hand the \"little neck\" of Grizel's dear sister \u2014 that sister who walked hand in hand with her, gazing vvith keen eyes on the strange flax-fields, or chards, tileries, and tulip-beds \u2014 and comparing them of nights with the broomy braes and hazel dens of that Scotland which she would never see again, \u2014 the cold, relentless grasp wrung out the young swelling, budding life in a few gasps and spasms of mortal agony. Then Grizel sank powerless as the dead before her ; she did not wail * Her daughter writes of Grizel at this time : \" She went to the market, went to the mill to have their com ground (which it seems is the way with good managers), dressed the linen, cleaned the house, made ready the dinner, mended the children's stockings and other clothes, and made what she could for them ; and, in short, did everything.\" On another occasion she records that Grizel would sit up for a whole night to work lace ruffles, in which her brother Patrick might apper.r among his equals."], [31, "owth 19 or cry ; she had even weak flitting visions of sub mission and resignation piercing the thick pall ; for she was a godly child, who had striven to order her conversation aright, and had offered God thanks and praise in many a joyous time that was gone by. Tenacious natures like Grizel's, though sanctified by grace, will weep tears of blood ere they can relinquish their treasures. Grizel passed through the fiery trial, and her life blos somed anew ; but one fibre of Grizel's warm heart stretched away from these dreary deserts to the glorious, holy heavens ; one pulse throbbed with patient but wistful throbs, for entrance into the pure ranks above, for renewed communion with one who had grown wise with a guileless but in effable wisdom, and tender with an inexhaustible tenderness. There was a great gathering of douce Scotch folk in that Dutch town-hall where Sir George Baillie was troth-plighted to Grizel Hume. They were exiles ; but the dry Scotch humour, the broad flashes of a strong race's hilarity, rose re freshed and shone forth in compliment to the occasion. If the troubles continued, the plenish ing would have been but poor, the house keeping arranged on the most rigid principles of Scotch thrift; but do you think for a mo ment such trifles could dismay Grizel ? She has left to us the song which, in the character of a shepherdess, she sang to the accompaniment of a"], [32, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 20 cracked harpsichord, while enamoured Sir George stood by her side, leaning against the great Dutch clock with its moon of a face encircled with a full wreath of convolvuluses and roses. \" Though our toom purse had barely twa bodies to clink, And a barley-meal scone were the best in our bink ; Yet he with his hirsel, and I with my wheel, Through the howe o' the year we would fend unco weel. Grizel saw better days ; returned to Scotland at the Revolution ; lived in state and bounty in her own land, and among her own people. The last glimpse we have of her is a very piquant one of a very old lady smiling and nodding over the sports of her grandchildren. Most girls, in Scotland at least, know the out lines of the story of Grizel Hume ; but she is known more as a heroine of the Covenant than as an original, independent, living, loving woman. She is not known as she should be in her sweet, quaint songs, and in the cordial biography of her daughter. I would fain have shown, in a few words, how happy and generous was her troubled youth ; how affectionate and constant her tried middle age ; how she fulfilled the proverb, \" keep a stey heart for a steep brae ;\" how she was spared to end her life as a blessed and blessing woman, with a loving daughter for her chronicler, and a fair descendant to bear down to a distant genera tion her honoured name."], [33, "21 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu left it as her shrewd, caustic, concise opinion that no greater obstacle could exist to a girl's prospects in the world than the reputation of talents. Therefore if a victim had the misfortune to inherit them, Lady Mary coolly and craftily advised her to hide them as closely as possible. Poor brilliant Lady Mary ! None knew better the hollowness which may attend on wit ; and the large, liberal spirit which brought to her country the benefit of inocu lation was cramped, withered, and tainted. Since Lady Mary's day, opinions have altered, and stan dards have changed. The dangers which attend intellect in a woman are now private and personal ones, with which the world does not interfere ; and the blessing of it has been demonstrated so honestly"], [34, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 22 and so largely, that now-a-days few even require, with Richard Lovel Edgeworth, to combat a good literary Dr. Day's antagonism to a literary daughter. Still, in one sense \u2014 that of settlement in life by marriage \u2014 the great aim at which Lady Mary pointed, \u2014 intellect, pure weight and force and re finement of mind, apart from all cunning, is rather disadvantageous than advantageous to the holder. Assumed the generality of men to be of ordinary capacities, of course the probability of the woman out of the generality of women (that is, of extra ordinary capacity) meeting her mate, is greatly lessened, although not to the extent' that is gene rally supposed. For while she is apt to frame to herself a standard in correspondence with her own faculties, and to be repelled by the shallow, dull, blunt crowd around her, there is, on the other hand, often untold magnanimity in a clever woman \u2014 a largeness of heart, along with a largeness of head, which acts as an antidote, and enables her to sink her cleverness to its due level. 61 Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever,\"' she murmurs. She values manliness, guileless ness, kindness at its proper price. Sne marries an upright, sensible, stupid, affectionate fellow, and calls him lord and master ; and the world laughs ; but she is happy in an atmosphere of intensely feminine happiness, deferring to him, honouring him, glorifying him with her whole moral nature ;"], [35, "Intellect. 23 and he acquires a dignity he never held before, and grows brighter and brighter under her brightness, is respectable and respected, and even his very children conduct themselves to him with a peculiar homage, moved by her delicate duty. Enough is not said and written of this submission ofthe men tal to the moral nature; this exaltation of virtue, this offering of the right hand and bent knee to the true man who loves God and his brother, and who, through the great sacrifice and the divine perfection, shall yet reign as a priest and a king. German literature has more of this gentleness. The popular domestic dramas of Princess Amalie of Saxony contain specimens of it. Dickens and Thackeray have noted it ; and one or two of my readers may recollect the gay, quick, pretty heiress who became enamoured of Cowper's description of his good simple-minded, rustic kinsman Johnnie. Apart from her opportunities of marriage, intel lect is almost an unmingled boon to a woman, un less it be of a very restless, obtrusive, and exacting description, such as to deprive her of her natural resources, weaken her fellow-feeling with her kind, or offend them by arrogance. These shadows are not uncommon attendants on cleverness, but they diminish every day. They rarely accompany true ability, but rather its showy counterfeit. The reproach of a blue-stocking is becoming obso lete. We have no fantastic Anna Sewards, neither have we demure Fanny Burneys, elaborately hiding"], [36, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 24 their volumes of the \" Lives of the Poets,\" lest they be suspected of the pretensions of learned ladies so imposing and alarming as Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Montagu. A woman never \" spouts \" now in public ; she is no more extravagantly proud of her information, her reflection, her imagination, than she is exceedingly ashamed of them. They are her inheritance ; a grave, glad inheritance, to be used, not abused, never to be sported, and, after all, no great rarity. Yet, while painters, poets, and writers in general are common enough among women, and matter-of-fact and quiet persons they are, exactly like their neighbours, still sagacious, cold Dr. Carlyle of Inveresk, recorded that uni versal accomplishments had produced a monotony among women, and that he sought in vain, in an other generation, for the sprightliness and sense so much esteemed and so patent in the female cir cles of his young days. He has too good ground for his complaint. Let girls honour and cherish their intellects, laughing at those men-novelists who would per suade them that they are more interesting and irre sistible as maidens and matrons, the more ignorant and helpless they can continue to linger. Let them arm themselves with the weapons left them by King Solomon : \" she openeth her mouth with wisdom ; \" \" strength and honour are her cloth ing ;\" \" she bringeth her food from afar ;\" \" with her own hands she planteth a vineyard ;\" \" let her"], [37, "Intellect. 25 own works praise her in the gates.\" Intelligent ignorance, very difficult to find now, is fresh and original. Sweetness, candour, tender-heartedness, and all goodness, are as incomparably superior to any mere mental organism in a woman as they are in a man, but the case ends there. A clever good woman is a finer, abler being than a stupid good woman, not to say a silly good woman. Folk would think us mad if we took the trouble to state the same proposition with regard to men ; to cite the self-evident fact is still necessary in behalf of women. There is no merit in weakness ; nay, if you have experience of the world, you will pro bably agree with Dr. Arnold that the large brains and the large hearts have a tendency to go to gether ; and that it is among the thoughtful women that you discover the utmost humility, disinterestedness, and devotion. But let young girls avoid cultivating intellect for intellect's sake. No more barren toil ; no more bootless harvest. Young girls ought to have many duties and delights ; and to cause intellect to super sede these, is to substitute what we call in Scotland a \" dry stone dyke\" for a green, sweet-smelling hedge, \u2014 philosophy for religion, head for heart. The writer has long remembered another writer's injunction to use literature for a means, but never for an end ; because if such a mistake is fatal to a man, it is doubly fatal to a woman. Sir Walter Scott talked of literature being a good staff but a"], [38, "26 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. bad crutch ; and girls should so consider intellect \u2014 a gracious faculty, but no more to engross them than beauty. If possible, they must find some definite object in their studies. Latin to read with a studious elder brother ; natural history to engage a volatile younger ' callant ;' drawing to occupy a delicate sister ; political economy to amaze and amuse papa ; penetration into the best novels to lighten the short leisure, divert the care burdened mind, relax and soften the somewhat contracted and concentrated sympathies of mamma, or one and all to bestow on friends and neigh bours. If there is no outlet for talents, no prospect ot their employment, and yet a clear opportunity to cultivate them, no doubt it should be taken up in faith. Learn, as Lady Jane read Plato, to calm the ruffled temper, and soothe the vexed spirit, or even to allay the aching finger. Learn for what learning may be some day. Most acquirements are called into service at some period of the life. Believe that it may benefit some one ; that it may help to support the student ; that, at the lowest estimate, it invigorates and enlarges the mind. To learn vaguely, when it is not for intellect's sake, is soon to flounder in a sea of knowledge without rudder or anchor. The best-intentioned girl cannot continue her lessons after she has left school in this pointless fashion. To learn selfishly because some gift of fancy, reason, or memory is"], [39, "Intescecr. 27 dleased by the exercise or because it is more con genial than any plain, commonplace, tiresome, fatiguing work, is sapping self-sacrifice and stead fastness, and at the outset giving way to wilfulness, self-assertion, and proud isolation. Keep intellect in its proper place as a stately, benign handmaiden, but only a handmaiden. Better and grander a thousand times the nimble fingers which can mend a rent, and mix a basin of soup to the comfort and relief of a fellow-creature, than the brain that can solve a problem for a feat, or conceive a poem for a flight. At the same time, the writer has no idea the two processes cannot be combined, and mutually improved by the union. Neither does such a con viction interfere with a girl's discovering the bent of her mind, and if possible, under religious and ioving limitations, carrying out a peculiar and indi vidual calling. Only do not over-rate intellect. It is no more an indispensable than beauty ; it was no more supplied where it was wanting by the Lord of good than wealth or beauty. Especially, do not overstrain a moderate intellect to do the work of a mighty one, and load it like a pack-horse till the poor, oppressed servant can scarcely stumble blinkingly along. This injunction needs to be im pressed upon the reader, because many girls cannot separate intellect from duty, and many who would refrain from joining in the chase after beauty, ex haust themselves in a superhuman, hopeless effort to render themselves sagacious and profound."], [40, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 28 \"There is that maketh the simple wise;\" but it is not human intellect or study. Good girls will moil and toil through arguments and philoso phies beyond their bearing, and read heavy books punctually but drearily, for conscience' sake. The motive sanctifies the labour, but the labour itself is useless. Unfortunately it is a mistake which worthy friends often confirm rather than contro vert. \" They do not like us to squander our time,\" says many a girl ; \" they want us to read something solid, \u2014 essays, reviews, works of science and his tory.

No doubt it is not nearly so en tertaining as Miss Yonge's and Miss Manning's books, and other books like them. And do you know they actually did us good : we thought of them, and behaved more generously at that pic nic ; we were more courageous and contented for them lying on the sofa after our illness ; and, ah, would you believe it ? we never have such an idea of foreign scenery and life as from some of those stories ; but you know they are only stories, and our friends like us to read solid books.

Sir Thomas More gently advised his Mar garet to desist from her attempt at a Scripture concordance, if she could relinquish it, because, although the effort was noble on her part, it was far beyond her knowledge and understanding ; and Margaret, mortified, abashed, disconsolate, wrung by the passion for so great a work, which she had excited in herself, yet yielded meekly, and reaped the fruits of her submission in future contentment and happiness. \" Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever.\" Never lose sight of that line.

WHAT BECAME OF PEN? \" And what will become of Pen ?\" The ques tion was asked in a company of young people who had been driven from playing cricket, and from looking on at the wickets, into the shelter of a forsaken schoolroom. Both boys and girls were at that age when they are still rejoicing in their emancipation from recent bondage ; when they will not readily recross schoolroom thresholds in case they should feel once more boys and girls pulling and jerking at the lead ing-strings, and galling themselves with the yoke which they trust they have dropped for ever. When they do re-enter the old precincts, they proceed forthwith to vindicate their freedom by violating every venerable rule and precedent.

Therefore they trooped into the disused schoolroom, and hastened to behave them selves after a fashion that would have provoked the ire of former instructors. They had no fear of raising their sensible, stolid, affected, despotic, passionate ghosts ; they quizzed the maps, they drummed on the tuneless, old piano, which would give back nothing but scales. At last they sat down on the benches in free-and-easy attitudes, and a languid wag striking his boot, as if he had been a Chesterfield, advanced from reminiscences of the past to predictions of the future. \" Tom will be a captain of volunteers, he has such a head for rows.

Neither could Pen see any in herent necessity for the case, since she knew herself"], [48, "36 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. to be, in spite of her pursuits, the warmest-hearted of the circle. At this time, however, Pen was, it must be confessed, both shy and ungainly. It is almost impossible for a sensitive girl to deviate from the beaten track without a sense of oddity and rectan gularly perplexing and harassing her. In spite of her mother, Pen had stinted her exercise for her studies, and her complexion was spoilt, and her carriage impaired. Then Pen happened to be large-boned; a conformation which, in opposition to plumpness, is at its worst stage at sixteen. Al together, Pen Hope would not strike any one as bearing the most distant resemblance to a fawn or a rose or a fairy ; she was not even a blooming, buoyant girl. Still the deprivation was neither very great nor very rare. Her defects did not prevent her being a growing, promising girl, perfect in all her members, as her friends were thankful to see. The Duke of Argyle and Mrs. Glass, in their de finition of the Deans', settled that Jeannie was not \" bonnie,\" just \" sonsy.\" Pen was not \" sonsy,\" but she was \" wiselike,\" another graphic Scotch term, literally wise-like, with capacity and sense and kindness, even in the over-prominent shoulder blades, which she had not given over hitching awkwardly.

There was no reason for disbelieving- o them, unless it existed in the pertinacity of the speakers, whose own daughters were so much more precocious, so much more symmetrical, so much better coloured, so much franker and smarter than was Pen. It must be stated that Pen's position in her family was at this time anomalous ; she was in one sense respected and loved, but she was in another teased and ridiculed.

Pen's parents had the most respect for her at this time, though they too were somewhat incredulous of the advantage of having her one bit more intellectual than the other girls. Pen was mostly \" poor Pen.\" \" Pen, you goose,\" was frequently heard from her brothers and sisters ; yet they consulted her in every diffi culty, sisters listened to her opinion on their new acquaintances, brothers told her their minds on their professions. A few years made all the difference in the world with regard to Pen's standing in public and private estimation. She was fully developed in body and mind ; she had lost the ungraceful protuberances which, sprouting out here and there, had constituted her ill-proportioned physically and spiritually. She had learned to feel at ease in the holding of any unusual gift, and to allow it neither more nor less than its plain due. What she had in keeping with her kind was so much greater than the trifles wherein she differed from them, that Pen would have now been the first to laugh at the notion that she was conspicuous or outlandish. Pen had evi denced her talents ; she had chalked out her walk ; she had established her reputation; \u2014 a superior girl, not so much accomplished as well informed, resolute, and persevering in all her ways, and her ways were the ways of a good, kind, clever woman. Pen's father and mother were comfortably off, and she did"], [51, "Intellect. 39 not need to work for her bread ; neither was she much required in that debatable field of house keeping which swallows up, with such feeble re sults, whole bevies of worthy young women. But Pen experienced no absence of interest and occu pation. She was near a large city, and she attended a ladies' college and a school of arts on her own ac count, and with a very cordial appreciation of, and consideration for, her fellow-students. She dabbled in industrial schools, Sunday schools, provident so cieties, and cottage libraries. She was a great gar dener, and actually reared slips and sowed seeds for the million, striving to foster an eye for beauty in eyes that are too often accustomed to ugliness and deformity. These were Pen's outlying concerns. Within her father's house she managed her mother's greenhouse and her father's aquarium. She wrote out short-hand notes of college lectures and me moranda for her brother Bill ; she filled in bulletins of home news, personal opinions, and scraps of reading for Joe to puzzle over in his Palmatta hat and shirt-sleeves, after his sheep-shearing by the Macquarrie river ; she hunted out books not too dry to present information and amusement to her sisters ; she was friendly to the young maid servants ; she conferred obligations on visitors, and contrived diversions for them when their stereo typed stock fell short of their necessities. Above all, as a key-note to the upright, merciful perfor mance, she never forgot her Bible and her prayers."], [52, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 40 The only thing that distinguished Pen Hope from the rest of the world now-a-days was this, that however much she had on hands, she was uniformly expected to do still more on any press of engagements. Pen was the installed bee of the family ; and when there was more honey than usual required for the daily consumption, it was Pen who was incontinently appointed to fly faster and farther, and complete the deficient nectar. However engrossed you found her, Pen was the individual to turn to with an application for im mediate and prolonged assistance. Pen had an immensely broad back to bear a sliding-scale of burdens, as she herself instinctively perceived and acknowledged. And with all her talents, industry, and kindness, there was a guilelessness about Pen that kept her in the midst of all her importance free from self-conceit and self-assertion. She was no longer the butt cf the family, but she remained their best play-fellow. Of course, as one consequence of the unequal distribution of labour in Pen's house, Pen was a very domestic animal. Then woe be to the man who should presume to withdraw Pen from her native sphere, and monopolize her manifold ex cellencies.

The Hopes never contemplated the possibility, although there was nothing to pre vent it. They were defenceless against the enemy. Pen's face and figure had ceased to be an objec tion ; the big-boned, stooping, sallow girl had passed into the stately woman, who could not avoid pin ning her shawls with a prestige, and whose bonnets and hats and auburn hair shaded a face, healthy in its colourlessness and thinness, as an active mind, a benevolent heart, and a busy life will, with fair play, insensibly freshen any face, however sharp and pale. Pen was generally reckoned a fine looking woman, though she had high cheek-bones. Her individual features were not anything extra ordinary, but her expression was excellent, so composed, so ready, so trusty, and often so humor ous. Pen had one distinct beauty. It is seldom that a young face wants one. Pen's hair \"waved like the ribbed sea-sand, so coyly, yet so archly ; the very roguishness of hair relieving Pen's over g-rave forehead. D Ah, but the Hopes had one stronghold against an attack upon their fortress, Pen. Pen was a clever woman. Married men and bachelors delighted to chat with her, but young men were rather apt to hide their diminished heads in her presence. She was no subject either for their flattery or their banter ; she did not look up to them or run after"], [54, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 42 them ; so the best thing they could do was to let her alone. The Hopes, as has been said, lived near a city. In fact, the head of the house was a manufac turer only partly retired from business. They had many neighbours in their comfortable, flowery villa ; wealthy, cultivated, middle-class people in the same circumstances as themselves. The villa nearest them belonged to an orphan brother and sister, and had been let till the brother was of an age to manage his manufactory, and the sister to reside with him as his companion and housekeeper. These Bushes came at last and displaced their tenants. The Hopes were disposed to be attentive to them in the face of the statistics soon acquired that Ned Bushe was but a good, stupid sort of fellow, and Miss Bushe was a thoughtless, head-strong girl. \" Look at that note, Pen ; it is as stiff as buck ram,\" observed Bill Hope, who was on all occa sions as fluent in conversation as a Frenchman. \" He hasn't anything to say,\" decided Pen, succinctly. \" What will a man with so few ideas do in a business ?\" \" My dear Pen, ideas have nothing to do with a business, unless you are going to turn your mind to inventions ; and I believe you could not turn your mind to what would pay you less in hard cash, or more assuredly break your heart and ruin your temper.

But the smartest man will allow a wide sea to a slow coach. He fathoms the soundness of the blunt brains, and relies loyally on the deliberate sagacity that is so toilsomely worked out and so destitute of ornament.

I was over at Westpark last night. Miss Bushe is a fanciful, finical, giddy goose, and I can assure you it was highly commendable, and what you would have liked, with all your heart, to see how Ned, who never had a fancy in his life, cared for her, and tried to make her comfortable. He remembered to ask particularly how she had amused herself during the day ; he ransacked his bad memory to bring forth news wherewith to entertain her, \u2014 what girls he had met ; who was riding ; when Lord Conniston's marriage was to come off in St. John's. I tell you he notices as little of such trash on his own behalf as any man. I am sure he had not a moment's peace all the time he was smoking so solemnly on his road home for recalling and jotting down these pink-muslin particulars for her delectation. He looked so big and red, and she so neat and pert, that it seemed as if he could carry her in his coat-pocket, as he would, poor soul ! if it would do her any good.

He is a better tranquillizer than the very best Cavendish. There is not a fellow I enjoy like Ned. I could suppose it a kind of earthly Paradise to sail up the Mississippi or the Nile, and shoot bisons and croco diles, and take sketches of the natives, and confide all your vague day-dreams to Ned Bushe.\" \" I don't agree with you,\" differed Pen, shaking her head. \" I want no mossy bank or hop pillow to lull me to sleep.\" \" That is because you are a crotchety, cantan kerous woman, full of perpetual motion, and all such spasmodic, everlasting horrors.\" Pen went to see Miss Bushe for herself, and"], [58, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 46 found her the quintessence of self-will, whim, and variable health and spirits. She was incompletely educated, full of partialities and prejudices, fond of excitement, without perseverance, and very nearly incapable of reflection. She was determined to be liked and to be happy, and she had about as little notion how to set about it as any rational creature under the sun. Finding her brother bent on her perfection and felicity, she plagued him almost out of his senses. She had not been a month at West park when she had taken disgusts in fifty quarters, and given offence in a hundred, and then she grew moped and cross and ill, and altogether, Fan Bushe, in place of being to be envied, as she had intended, was exceedingly to be pitied. That was what attracted Pen Hope to her after the other girls had discovered her to be provoking and aggravating ; after the young men had wearied of her as a novelty, and settled that she had not sufficient beauty to carry off her humours, when her vanity was wounded, and her sincerity, the best thing about her, soured. Pen Hope, having a very full complement of men and women on her mind and heart already, could not resist adding to them this discontented, undisciplined, ignorant girl. Fan Bushe was glad to have Pen walk across once or twice a week during those bleak, bitter March days, when Fan's cough was at the worst, were it only to convey to her club-books, designs from her school of arts, recipes for more"], [59, "Intellect. 47 palatable biscuits, and more drinkable gruel. At the same time, Fan was little more agreeable to Pen than to the rest of the world. She was flighty, and slighted Pen, she murmured and op pressed Pen perpetually ; but she grasped at her kindness, and was resentful if Pen passed a week without coming over to inquire for her, and to ex pend one of her dear hours of well-earned leisure on a yawning, grumbling, spiteful girl. Fan's eyes were not opened to the extent of her debt of grati tude to Pen Hope, and the enormity of her utter indifference to it, while sunning herself eagerly enough in her solitary gleam of friendship, until one day, to Ned, she was guilty of the wickedness and coarseness of sneering at good and noble Pen, and attributing to her low motives. Then, indeed, Fan was fairly overwhelmed by the sudden dignity and sternness of the good, clumsy, patient brother, \u2014 the crushing emphasis with which he pointed out to her, in his plain words, that if she were not a motherless girl, a poor fretting girl, whom the world took at her own valuation as a coquette and tyrant, Pen Hope would not look near her ; that Pen was a pious soul, a tender soul, and she would fain see all girls healed of their spiritual diseases, and ren dered as peaceful and industrious and blest as her self. Ned Bushe could have bitten his tongue out within the hour for being so savage to his foolish, young sister ; and Fan sobbed as if her heart would break, and declared she would go away"], [60, "48 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. anywhere, anywhere where she was not hated, where people would understand her, and care for her. Alas ! Fan, where, if not to Westpark and Beechhill ? and to whom, if not to such pure Sama ritans as your brother Ned and Pen Hope. How ever, Fan appeared next day considerably subdued, and inclined to be tearfully affectionate to Ned, and decently respectful to Pen Hope ; and oh, the treasures of compunction, faith, and fondness which Ned lavished upon her, without waiting to expose her to ten minutes' probation. Ned Bushe used to walk with Pen Hope back to Beechhill along the morsel of suburban road, and the two shrubberies, when he had come home from his mill, and Pen had trenched upon dusk just before dinner. Pen feared the escort was a civil necessity, and antedated both her calls and her de parture from Westpark ; but then it happened that Ned Bushe also antedated his return from his place of business. So Pen accepted the courtesy, and de termined not to gape on principle, and on principle was agreeably surprised to discover that she and Ned Bushe could talk together pleasantly, like a couple of firm, familiar friends. Ned had not read many of her favourite books, was uninitiated in a thousand mysteries of which she had delightful inkiings ; but he was possibly a few steps before her in science, and he was her match on any ground of social benevolence. It is probable that the members of the middle classes, the honest,"], [61, "Intellect. 49 well-disposed middle classes, are better off as man and woman than their brothers and sisters a few rounds higher on the social ladder, for opportunities of mutual interest \u2014 openings where they can alike enter and compare counsel to their mutual edifica tion and enjoyment.

There is a vast deal that is wholesome and nourishing in our commonest humanity, and your practical people all live to acknowledge it.

She tried to appreciate his position, she tried to offer suggestions when he asked her for them, she was aware he could not unbosom himself to Fan, and she had some intelligence on the subject at his dis posal, by inheritance. Once she was rash enough to prick him on to a pecuniary risk. By some chance a secret of trade came out between the two, and Pen knew that Dillon, who had wanted in vain to deal with her father, had also applied unsuccessfully for a business engagement with Ned Bushe. The men saw him in the same light as the representative of a wrecked house ; the women regarded him in other colours, as the shamed son of a fraudulent debtor, striving in vain to redeem his credit. \" That poor Dillon !\" lamented Pen. \" I wish I were a man, I think I would trust him once at least,\" sighed she again ; and the next thing Pen heard was a remark of her father's, that young Bushe had been regarded as prudent, though not bright, but he would never do if he went and allied himself with disreputable people like the Dillons. Good Ned Bushe, to extend a twig to a drowning man, and not mind being drawn in himself over the boots ; but she trusted he would come out dry-shod in the end, and rebuke trade-caution. Her father was liberal in everything save trade. Take care, Pen, that you be not liberal but lavish. But business men are apt to be sick of business, and to leave it behind them at their shops, and"], [63, "Intellect. 51 arrive at their town-houses and villas wanting only to be idle and amused. This excuse is allowed for their attachment to the emptiest and most child ish women, or for their homage to the mere elegan cies which are opposed to their daily roughnesses. Thus your city-men hanker infatuately after the most polished and heartless of fine ladies, \u2014 women so unwomanly that they never approach the citadel of these city-men's hearts and lives, dwell at a dis tance from their struggles, are satisfied with the receipt of the ease and luxury of their husband's provision, and superciliously ignore their origin. Pen was considerate enough to understand this phase of a man's nature, and when Ned Bushe sauntered and looked about him instead of straight before him, and asked after her flowers and drawings, and even made remarks on her dress, she relaxed and gossipped glibly, with a dash of originality in her gossip which, strange to say, he relished keenly, though he could not have traced it to its source. \" What news, Mr. Hope ? \" petitioned Mrs. Hope one afternoon, according to the custom by which we live, like the Athenians, from day to day in order to hear and see some new thing. \" Dillon is down again ; that's no news ; but Bushe has got a slap over the fingers \u2014 serve him right ; Bushe's house was never before brought in with any such shaky concern.\" Truly, the wariness with which manufacturing and mercantile voyages can be accomplished, for"], [64, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 52 scores of years and whole .generations, and yet every leaky vessel steered clear of and left behind, is something wonderful. It must be a sleight of hand acquired by these money-holders. \" I 'm sorry to hear it, he is such a good natured fellow, and Bill's friend ; I'm afraid he's too soft ; he ought to ask advice.\" \" Security thrown to the dogs. Dillon could not stand ; every old hand and most young ones could have told him that.\" Pen was conscience-struck. Doubtless, Ned Bushe could afford the loss, but to occasion it, to expose him to animadversions, to entangle him in useless, perhaps evil, generosity ; Pen rued her part extremely, and took herself to task with the greatest severity. What did any woman know of business ? What call had she to interfere in Ned Bushe's concerns ? She had thought herself very clever and charitable, no doubt ; but this slow, soft Ned Bushe would have managed his affairs infinitely better without her, \u2014 would have done the juster, more merciful thing in the end. Pen remembered what Bill had observed of Ned Bushe's capacity. He was not a fool ; he judged correctly, and acted firmly when a meddler let him alone. It was Pen's first lesson in how far the practical sense of a heavy man transcends the theoretical enthusiasm of a clever woman. Pen took the first opportunity to express her abundant contrition."], [65, "Intellect. 53 \" Don't say anything about it,\" entreated Ned Bushe ; \" I am not sure that you were wrong yet. I have been thinking a good deal of what you said of a fellow comfortably off venturing such a sum as he could spare every year, not to encourage flash adventurers without a farthing, but to stave off bankruptcy from honest, hard-pressed strugglers. I think there would be real morality in it, and it would not be bad policy either in the long-run.\" \" But this case was exceptional. It was past being retrieved. I did not know that at the time, but I ought not to have given an opinion,\" per sisted Pen. \" Don't mention it ; you can't think I grudge it. Besides, surely you know I would do anything for you.\" The sentence was unmistakable, and Pen could not pass it off as a joke, with Ned Bushe striding along by her side, so red and serious. Pen was dreadfully disturbed. \" I beg your pardon, Mr. Bushe. Do not say that ; I cannot hear it.\" Pen did not very well know what she was saying, but in consideration of her confusion Ned Bushe went no farther. Pen was not blind to the discomfiture and the involuntary reproach on the face that had always turned so willingly to wards hers. Pen had been very indiscreet ; she who had con stantly taken such good care of herself and others, that she was confided in as fully as any old woman."], [66, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 54 She had been cruel too ; she who was in the daily habit of contriving a multitude of kindnesses. Pen considered the conclusion ridiculous ; but she wished the absurdity were the worst of it. She could not bear to think of Ned Bushe feeling repulsed and rejected. What presumption and callousness in any woman to entice and expose a strong, gentle fellow to such a fate ! As Bill had said Ned Bushe would have borne martyrdom for the de fenceless if the occasion had called for it, and now think of him left to the tender mercies of Fan when mortified and heart-sore, as men are even at the first brunt of such a disappointment ; think of him subjected to the unrestrained fire of Fan's levity and petulance ! How the steady head would ache, the big hand tremble, the grey eyes grow dim, when he reflected that he could not set that uncon scionable girl at rest, could not contribute materi ally to her satisfaction and enjoyment ; while for his prospect of the union and affection of a home, there remained only that Fan's miserable selfishness. Pen could not aid Ned Bushe any longer \u2014 not when his need was greatest. That could not be thought of; she could do nothing more for Fan, though Fan should deepen in perversity, and wan der wildly into vice. Pen was as sorrowful as sorrowful could be. Pen thought it like Ned Bushe's generosity to come to the house with Bill immediately after wards, to show that he harboured no resentment,"], [67, "Intellect. 55 even while he was fluttered, poor fellow, and could not speak to her. Miles Whitcock, the old acquaintance who had threatened Pen with the garret half-a-dozen years before, was strolling in the grounds at Beechhill with Bill and Ned Bushe. Mrs. Hope wanted Pen and a sister to join them. \" Yes, Pen, you must go, for I can't send Kate alone, and I don't want them in the drawing-room just yet ; I have got a letter to write here ; no, thank you, dear, you cannot do it. It is a few lines to go with your own letter to poor, dear Joe ; and although they are not much worth, I would not have my boy miss his mother's sentences for all the other boys on the face of the globe. I know Bill medi tates bringing in these lads to tea ; but if you and Kate get your hats, and go out for a stroll, and take them round to see the dog ami the pony, they '11 dangle there till supper-time, if you like. I '11 not try you so far. I '11 come out myself and fetch you all in presently.\" Pen sallied out, and walked about among the dropping laburnums and guelder roses without much heart. Bill and Miles Whitcock were in full career on the science of history and meta physics. Ned Bushe was walking silently beside them. Was he reflecting of what use were his thews and sinews without subtlety of brain ? And why did the rose smell as sweetly to him as to another, and the great, ragged house-dog, Watch,"], [68, "56 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. pertinaciously select his knee to rub his nose upon, when he was not fit for high-flown philosophy and poetry ? To Pen's own surprise, as well as to Ned Bushe's, she began to twit him with his attention to the dog. \" Take care, Mr. Bushe ; don't suffer Watch to use liberties with you, or else people will suppose you consider him as your equal. You have no idea how impertinent the world can be.\" Bill caught up her words, and looked round with a surprised, annoyed air ; and Pen herself was scared at the idea of having been guilty of a wan ton insult the moment after she had spoken. Ned Bushe crimsoned, and laughed awkwardly. \" Oh, Watch is a jolly fellow !\" \" I cannot see what his jolliness has to do with your complacence, unless, indeed, you are grateful to him for not being particular in his choice.\" She had repeated the offence, and she could not tell why she had done it. She felt stung and ex asperated. She shut her mouth and pressed her hands together to contain herself. \" Pen, you've been walking too much to-day,\" remarked Bill abruptly ; \" you're as white as paper. That horrid college will be the death of you ; I wonder my mother allows it.\" \" Miss Pen, I honour your intellectual activity,\" observed Miles Whitcock gallantly. \" Do you ?\" exclaimed Pen sharply ; \" it is more than I do. I cannot see that it is much worth.\""], [69, "Intellect. 57 \" What, Miss Hope, you a deserter ! I thought we could always depend upon your support.\" \" Did you ?\" again demanded Pen, and still more dryly, sensible that she was anything but gracious ; but feeling Miles Whitcock in her own mind to be an intolerable prig and pedant, she re volted at the idea of being baited by him. You observe, clever as Pen was, she was an impul sive woman at the foundation. Miles Whitcock was perplexed in his shrewd ness. Bill thought that he had never seen Pen all ruffled as if she had rolled among nettles until this moment. Miles Whitcock continued to flat ter Pen. Times were changed. Pen had risen in his estimation. Pen was no mean skirmisher in the war of wit, and of course it was to be supposed that she could value a worthy antagonist. \" You don't mean that you've lost faith in the empire of mind, and propose to grovel for the rest of your days in patchwork and crochet ?\" \" 1 was very fond of patching when I was a little girl. Kate will tell you I like to crochet yet.\" \" Oh ! as a foil or a blind.\" \" Not at all, Mr. Whitcock. To a foil or a blind I trust I would not condescend.\" \" Then why in the name of wonder should you waste your fine energies ?\" \" I'm not sure that it is wasting my energies.\" \" Little means to accomplish little ends.\" \" Mr. Whitcock, you remember the race be-"], [70, "58 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. tween the hare and the tortoise, and which won ? I don't know what I think of the tortoise, but I believe I hate the hare.\" \" I'm very glad there is mamma making her ap pearance to summon us to tea,\" put in Kate Hope, \" for you are too discursive and figurative for me. I cannot tell what you are after. Perhaps you don't know yourselves. But not a gentleman among you has offered me a nosegay, and I gather one regularly every day after dinner, and wear it as a bouquet at tea.\" Pen Hope was blushing hotly. She was obliged to her mother for advancing to their relief, and she was grateful to Kate for diverting the notice from her, and coveting for herself the tiniest sprig of hawthorn rather than abide being overlooked. Poor Pen, not knowing what it was to be indebted to accidents, and the good offices of others, had never been so little mistress of her own self-respect and serenity. It had been an unfortunate, an unhappy evening, and she was sick of it. \" Go and make tea, Penelope.\" Pen could exe cute that office at least without incurring- further D distress and disgrace. No, Ned Bushe wished to assist her, and Pen must look daggers at him to get rid of him, and save herself from inflicting on him further injury. You see Pen's fetters had been assumed so recently, and still weighed so heavily, that she was yet mad enough to writhe and wrench at them."], [71, "Intellect. 59 \" Miss Pen, pray make up your mind as to what you think of the tortoise,\" whispered Ned Bushe, bending down to her. Pen was struck dumb ; she had never anticipated this suggestion. She became deaf too, obstinately deaf, for the rest of the meal. Ned Bushe was assailing her at one ear. Who would have dreamt that Ned would have grown valiant ? His stature towered so big, his voice sounded so deep-toned, even in a whisper, that he terrified Pen. And there was Bill planting him self on the other side, uttering protests against her decoctions, clamouring for cream, and sugar, and water, and tea, in successive breaths. She had been an attentive sister to Bill all her days : it was dreadful despotism in him not to spare her this one night. Even when tea was removed, Pen could not leave the room without provoking observation, so hampered does a large family circle and great popularity render a notable woman. At last Pen rose up to look for a newspaper to which her father had referred, presented him with the wrong quotation, and, relying confidently on Ned Bushe's civility to sit out her father's elocution, went into the greenhouse, as if to fulfil her usual evening's inspection. But we've all heard when a modest man waxes bold, there are no bounds to his auda city. When a pacific man shows fight, he never leaves off till he is conqueror of the field. The enemy followed Pen unwarrantably, and Pen found,"], [72, "60 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. too late, that she had exchanged the comparative safety of disregarded whispers, in the busy crowd of the drawing-room, for loud speech in the still ness and solitude of the greenhouse. Ned Bushe was either magnanimous to begin with, or else he designed to throw Pen off her guard. He professed that he had only come there to second her in pulling off the dead leaves, and tying up the drooping branches ; he even lopped off a bough which had been beyond Pen's power of decapita tion, and which Bill had shamefully neglected for the last fortnight. \" You would not be the worse of a strong, steady fellow constantly at hand,\" commented Ned Bushe insidiously. \" You may sow and water and trim things like these, and name them by names I cannot remember, and see them in lights I do not perceive, but for all that, you are no more fit for the heavy, dirty work of life than a weak child like Fan.\" Pen vouchsafed him no answer. \" Of course I understand that you might find a friend as sharp as I am blunt, who would electrify you to no end, but the cleverest man alive could not invest you with the privilege it is mine to be stow. Pen, Pen, I could envy you that privilege.\" \"What privilege ?\" demanded Pen, bewildered. \" That of stooping to the fellow who loves and honours you. Ah, Pen Hope, if I could but bend and distinguish you !\""], [73, "Intellect. 61 \" Every good man distinguishes the woman he approves,\" said Pen, in low, truthful, humble tones ; and then she burst out passionately, \" You are as bad as Miles Whitcock.\" Ned Bushe looked aghast. \" Who said that I idolized intellect ; that I did not think the wisest woman that ever was born \u2014 who could cast a girdle round the globe, or dig to the foundations of the earth \u2014 only a frail, erring human being, not to be compared to a brave, righteous man ? \" \" Pen, Pen, come out and see the glowworms,\" called a turmoil of voices in the distance. \" Yes, yes,\" answered Pen excitedly, hastening to obey them. \" We' are no more than a race of moiling glowworms, and some of us are gifted with lamps a grain bigger than others, and of course we are charitably supposed to be dazzled with our own blaze of light.\" \" If you are dazzled, Pen, won't you have my arm ? \" \" I never thought that I was dazzled ; it was you that would have had me credit it.\" \" Well then, dearest Pen, cannot you submit to a false accusation ?\" Pen submitted : a true man's arm is not a stay for a true woman to cast away. \" It is too bad,\" asserted Bill Hope, coming into the room with the calmness of despair, closing the door carefully after him, and addressing Mrs."], [74, "62 Papers for Thoughtful Girls.

Of course Pen has refused him ? \" \" Has she ? She has referred him to my father.\" \" There must be a mistake, Bill, Ned Bushe is such a great simple fellow.\" \" Sharp enough for his own ends, it seems. I wish I had never introduced him to the premises. I assure you he is too slow a coach to run into an error. Besides, I saw that somebody or other was in a mess last night.\" \" But Pen cannot do without us.\" Bill laughed ironically. \" Very well, Bill, I'm sure I know we'll be stagnant without Pen ; she was always moving about, and bringing in fresh air. But Pen has been so occupied with her books and fellow creatures, I declare to you she has no hands to speak of, except for her patterns and her letters, which will be of no use to her now ; she has in terfered very little with the management of the table, she dresses without taking much pains, and she sews very indifferently.\""], [75, "Intellect. 63 \" Bless you, Kate, Ned Bushe does not want hands ; for that matter he can hire them by the hundred ; he wants a head, and he has got it, \u2014 the clearest head in the house,\" groaned Bill. \" The clearest head in the house thrown away on a blockhead,\" continued Kate flippantly.

I do not give the precedence from my own judgment, but from popular opinon. We are a nation of philosophers ; we are religious as well as reasonable ; yet, unless where we are mer cenary, we have only to enter into society to see that a girl's sweet face is apt to be treated as her chief jewel. There is no exaggeration intended ; it is only a fool who will take regular features and a carnation complexion in lieu of all other engaging qualities ; but in alliance with them the old song of \" My face is my fortune,\" may still be loudly sung. What does a young girl intuitively desire, some times to excess, as an element of influence, a source of the approbation with which we would all inspire our neighbours, but to present a pleasing appearance among her companions and before her"], [79, "Beauty. 67 world, to be graceful if not lovely, neat if not graceful ? They say even Madame de Stael would have pledged her intellect against Madame Reca mier's beauty. Why refuse to look plainly at this second nature ? Why insist on ignoring it in spite of its universal force, and the immense expenditure of time, means, and mind which it costs ? Why not rather try to measure it, to say how far it is right, where it should end, what should be its counterpoise ? Strange enough, that while the Sauls have lost much of their ancient prestige, as by the head and shoulders above their brethren ; while we are no longer wild, poetic folk, clinging to personal dis- tinctions, valuing our men by their Wallace height and yellow hair, their Bruce's length of arm and iron jaw, we do still esteem our Abigails for their comeliness rather than their discretion, our Sarahs for their fairness rather than their fidelity. But mark this limit ; men and women are caught by such graces, but they are not retained by them. No, no ; plain and homely women, take this com- fort to yourselves. Only by such truth and ten derness as may rise in floods beneath the rough husks of your ungainly and unprepossessing ex teriors, can friends be kept and lovers held till death, and beyond death. But the secret of captivation ; the winning look, air, tone, what a gift it is ! Do not venture to deny it before Rachael loved and Leah hated ;"], [80, "68 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. before Job's daughters, with their recorded inherit ance. Beauty, then, is a possession given by God ; it is in itself a blessing, and no curse. No one need be ashamed to claim it ; no one need be ashamed to cherish it in its degree. Let it be worn meekly, let it be used graciously, let it be consecrated by baptism, and there it stands like the blush of the rose, and the daisy's whiteness, to delight all eyes and hearts, to do God's work. Now, with regard to what it certainly is not : it is far from the first gift. The God-man, who showered blessings on the poor and needy, peace to the guilty conscience, health to the drooping body, sight to the dim eyeball, hearing to the dull ear, in all his giving gave neither wealth nor beauty. Does any one object to the remembrance as uncalled for ? But, my friend, young girls would often \u2014 do sometimes barter one of his precious loans, viz., health, in the reckless race after beauty. There is a terrible little story, either in Boswell's Johnson, or in Madame D'Arblay's Diary, of a young girl, who, in preparation for an assembly, with the view of reducing her ruddy colour to a genteel paleness, had herself taught to \" blood\" herself, and practised the art so effectually, that she appeared in the ball-room like a ghost, the opened vein burst afresh during the following night, and she lay a corpse the next morning !

What sufferings have been inflicted on themselves and others by the queens of faces ! not always intentionally, not al ways wittingly : \" But evil is wrought by want of thought, As well as want of heart\" It was not only to answer \" the pomp of pride,\" but also the demands of pampered beauty that any mitigated original of such a picture could have been supposed to exist. \" And, oh ! those maidens young, Who wrought in that dreary room, With figures drooping like spectres thin, And cheeks without a bloom.

The wise man said, \" beauty is deceitful.\" His words have been drawn out, and twisted, and mis taken until worthy people have come to be very near thinking that beauty, God's gift, is no gift at all, or the Devil's gift, and, against their own unerring instincts, they have abused it publicly and prized it by stealth. Still, beauty is deceitful, and for the very reason that has given it a precedence in these essays ; because it is the most attractive gift which, along with a moderate share of others, can outwardly distinguish a young girl ; because it is seen to a certain extent, and appreciated by all, and most highly appreciated by those most incap able of appreciating any other endowment, \u2014 it is ' deceitful,' perhaps the most perilous of all goodly inheritances to a woman. For a beauty, admired, courted, and caressed, exalted abroad and made much of at home, in a fond reflection of her triumphs, it is probably more difficult to be sincere, unselfish, humble, patient, opposed to sense and inclined to faith, than for any other female charac ter ; unless a poor, wretched creature, soured by ill treatment, stupid by ignorance, and mad by anguish.

A word, cordial and not cold, honest and not false, cheery and yet sympa thetic. I do not say, what many will tell you, that beauty is only skin deep ; you know that as well as I, and yet, notwithstanding, that beauty \" fools will adore.\" I do not say to you, what many will assure you of, that it is of no consequence ; plain women are as much admired and loved ; only the weak or the vicious put a weight on beauty. You and I know that is not true : we have seen or heard of the good and gifted led in beauty's chains as well as the silly and besotted ; wise men and women infatuated, true men and women tortured. But for all that, there is ample comfort for you, enough to heal your heart, and make you what you so often are \u2014 the most estimable and the dearest in the end. Accept a few plain, prosaic hints, and one high, pure, strong consolation. Very few have not some pleasantness in their persons ; there are as few strictly ugly as strictly beautiful. The most have medium attractions, dif fering in value very much according to different tastes. It is probable that, in discontent or mor bid humour, you have forgotten this, and over looked some fresh tint, some shapely feature, some soft outline, some arch dimple, some speaking brightness, which, to many a one, may be quite enough to gratify the eye and warm the heart. It is even a fact, that what are ordinarily reckoned defects, to some visions are excellencies. I think"], [84, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 72 Cobbett owned such a convenient perversity, and William Wordsworth was more than suspected of it. An intelligent expression, above all a benevo lent expression, peace and purity on the brow, faith in the eyes, love on the lips, will, unless in rare cases, supply the ugliest fairy with sufficient charms to constitute her the favourite godmother in the long-run. It is only the outer world which beauty affects. What heart capable of loving ever loved a good mother, sister, wife, daughter less for a sallow skin, a squint, a projecting tooth ? It is undeniable that in existing society the want of generally acknow ledged personal comeliness may limit the ties of life, may prevent sympathetic feeling, and leave affec tion unsought and unclaimed ; but it does not in fluence the ties which God has already formed for us, and surely there are few entirely without them ; at the worst, there are the forlorn in all ranks ; the poor, whom we have with us always. Do you remember the poet's advice to the high-born beauty \" sickening of a vague disease ?\" \u2014 you see beauties have their troubles like other people \u2014 \" Go teach the orphan boy to read, And teach the orphan girl to sew.\" But I would not stop short with averring that per sonal defects and weaknesses do not influence us in the ties which we already grasp in defiance of them.

Look at the mother's sacred devotion to her deformed, ay, her idiot child. Will not the manly brother regard with a vein of fond chivalry the short sighted, awkward, freckled, or red-haired sister, who is yet his darling and his good angel ?

Beware of di vorcing any part of your walk from your spiritual life. Remember the apostle's lesson, \" Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all unto the Lord ;\" and that, while we stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, it is not reverence which separates our common cares from God ; it is hardness of heart and unbelief. At this rate we will have heaven on one side and earth on another.

Young girls, are you blooming, stately, agile, merely pretty ? Do not be hypocrites about it. It is just possible one engrossed or careless heart does not heed it, one very modest temper is not sure of it, doubts it with even painful suspicions of a mean, base tabernacle of the flesh. It is more likely that several spirits, acting on upright prin ciple and high nurture, try strenuously to crush out the sense of pleasure in their fair faces and lithe figures, and strive to persuade themselves that they are as indifferent to them as any veiled nun should be, as if they were clad in serge instead of silk, and crowned with a quakeress's cap in place of flowers or pearls.

When St. Stephen's Green was the fashionable promenade in Dublin, not long after pretty Mrs. Delany and tuneful Mrs. Donellan walked three times round it, and three times passed the brass statue of George the Second, every fine day, in order to recruit their constitutions and complexions for the Bishop of Cork and Ross's hospitalities, two girls, in the poplins and mantuas of the genteel life ofthe period, walked in the dusk ofthe evening in the direction leading from Leeson Street to Fish amble Street. They were panting with the speed they were making, while they occasionally talked with much eagerness. \" I wonder if we shall get them, Sally ?\" \" If we do, they will be the top of the mode, Peg, for she never has anything behind the fashion.\" \" I wonder if we shall charm her ladyship ? \" \" Sure, we can try, Sally ; if we do, it will be the making of us.\""], [91, "Beauty. 79 Clearly, it was a mission of great importance in the girls' eyes, enough to engross them so com pletely, that they neither looked to the right nor to the left as they pursued their way, though more than one passenger in the dim light looked after them. Maria Edgeworth tells us, that at the Dublin Ranelah her young sister Honor was mobbed and compelled to retire from the scene \u2014 strange distinction of royalty and beauty \u2014 on account of her personal attractions ; but these girls in the sprigged poplins, they not only charmed Dublin, they turned the dogged John Bull head of the City and Court of London. They were not alto gether safe from notice and annoyance at this hour and in these streets, but Irishmen are gallant and Irishwomen fearless. However, as the girls approached the door of a house in Fishamble Street, one of them hung back. \" I cannot do it, Peg ; she will be angry.\" \" Angry ! child, she is the best-natured woman in the world.\" \" She will grudge her lute-strings and laces.\" \" Grudge ! Sally, she is so free-handed, she scatters silver coin every night among the boys and girls that run after her chair.\" \" And they cry, ' We don't want your poor money ; we want one of your smiles, you jewel, for they are like the dawn of day.' But now, Peg, don't you think it is low in us to push ourselves into a player's house and borrow her bravery ? \""], [92, "80 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. \" My dear creature, we cannot help it, it is our only hope. Such a dance as I have run to get the card to the Lady Lieutenant's, and it is plain we cannot go without fine clothes, and father finds he cannot furnish them.

When did rampant selfishness remember a benefit, worldly or un worldly ? The tradition lingers of the loan, but who records the repayment ? What mention is there made of the two loveliest and stateliest peeresses in his Majesty's realm supporting and consoling poor penitent Peg Woffington ? \" Oh, Peg, Peg Gunning ! I don't think it is becoming.\" \" You silly, changeable chit, we have no time to lose,\" scolded the bolder adventuress. \" I'll tell you what, Sally ; will you go in with me, if I fetch out Sally Fortescue, who is to introduce us to her ladyship, and if she consent to bear us company?\" \" It would not be so bad, Peg,\" granted Sally, like all cowardly, credulous persons, inclined to snatch at the defence of company ; \" you know you often say the more the merrier.\" \" I never need folk to lead me by the nose,\" grumbled Peg, \" but Sally Fortescue is good natured when you speak her fair ; and she wants sorely, for her own ends, to be sure, to be off\" with her ladyship, while we want as mightily to be on"], [93, "Beauty. 81 with her ; so for the present we suit each other like curds and cream.

In a few minutes she returned with a girl blushing under her hood, and plucking nervously at her apron. \"I'm afraid it is not right, Peg ; you may have anything you like of mine, and welcome ; I'll rather stay at home myself.\" \" Heyday ! and who would present us to her Ladyship ?

I saw Mrs. Woffington at the Bishop's last week. I'll go with you.\" The three hurried on a few paces, and stopped before a door. The mistress of the party knocked without a moment's pause. A slatternly lodging house servant, slatternly, but still pleasant as only Irish women can look pleasant in rags and dirt, and hair all dangling about their ears, answered their summons. Mrs. Woffington was at home, but could see no company ; she was about to get ready for the theatre. What was to be done then ? \" Tell Mrs. Woffington it is three rival beauties in trouble, who have ventured to seek her counsel and ask her charity.\" \" Send them up, honey,\" called a rich voice over"], [95, "Beauty. 83 the filthy bannisters ; \" Peg Woffington don't re fuse a favour when she can grant it, and sorry a rival does she fear either.\" Up the littered staircase, where cabbage-stalks and withered nosegays tripped the arched feet of the great actress, into a parlour smelling vilely of tobacco- smoke, and used as a sitting-room and dressing-room, running over with heterogeneous clothes, play-books and play-bills, gilt crowns, and nun's beads, and cards of invitation, with a cleared corner of the table, on which lay fragments of bread and cheese, at which the occupant of the room was still munching ; not too untidy or unsa voury a snuggery for Peg Woffington, who was picked up by Argus-eyed Madame Violante humbly washing clothes at the side-current of the Liffey. In the middle of the mess stood the people's beauty tapping her fingers on the table, and meet ing with vivacity the faltering gaze of the new comers. In the universal poplin, with no ruffles but cambric frills round her arms, and a fly-cap on the back of her head ; a face somewhat broad, but with the perfection of teeth and eyes to which some faces owe so much, and with that constant suc cession of light and shade, flicker and flash, which belongs to a mobile expression, and invests it with a fascination which is like that of flesh and blood over wood and stone \u2014 buxom, brilliant, kindly ; but woe is me ! there were lines of self-indulgence already written round the flexible mouth, with the"], [96, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 84 milk-white glittering teeth ; and in the warm hazel eyes there had gleamed ere now evil spirits of wan tonness and passion. \" I am Peg Woffington ; at your pleasure.

Pho ! out with it, girls ; we are equals when you come to see me, and no one can say I ever turned my back on an ally, though many an ally has played a scurvy trick to me. Only don't keep me waiting; I'm his Majesty's and the country's servant, remember that ;\" and Peg laughed her gay, somewhat boisterous laugh, re flecting to how many her service was slavery. \" We are the Gunnings,\" declared the peti tioner, audacious enough after she had once be gun, \" and this is Sally Fortescue from the south ; and after yourself we are the three top beauties of Dublin this season.\" \" I know, I know,\" cried Peg, delighted with her visitor's frankness ; \" one of you is called Peg after myself.

If you had not held the dregs of a noble heart, full of free admira tion of all that was beautiful, you would have been furious with jealousy. You had reigned on your own boards ; but yours were but plebeian boards after all ; hers was to be a patrician footstool to a pa trician throne. A whole century has echoed the renown of the Gunnings' faces, and their born aristocracy of beauty ; their ivory brows ; the curl of their long brown eye-lashes ; their dimples in those cheeks of velvet, brushed with the bloom of a peach ; their fine noses and chins ; their delicate, haughty nostrils ; their throats, where the black velvet bands formed wicked contrasts to the white, firm, yet soft flesh and blood \u2014 something not cold like snow, but warm as a little bird, and mellow in its whiteness, like the white in the fur ofthe ermine. Peg Woffington drew a long breath of approval. \" I'm afeared to have any more looks,\" declared Peg in comical consternation. But Peg was not frightened or vexed ; she was delighted, \u2014 poor ardent Peg ; and she fairly clapped her hands when, having gloated over the other Gunning, she finally unhooded Sally Fortescue \u2014 a face at that moment as crimson as a stock gilly- flower, half shy, half vexed, yet so open, so pure, with such cool, calm wells of eyes, such a gentle placid"], [98, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 86 mouth. \" You three bate Banagher,\" cried Peg, making use of her old brogue ; \" you are a fine set of beggars, you darlings.

Mrs. Woffington, we would not be unreasonable ; but we have received an in vitation to the Casde to-night, and we confide it to you, that we have not a stitch of decent clothes for our backs.

In the meantime Peg was screaming for her servant, and tossing over the contents of her great boxes, and casting before them an ample choice. \" What shall it be, girls ?

It is quite thrown away on Sally Fortescue ; she would prefer to run back to Deanston, work in the garden, ride Dennis O'Rourke, help her mother and her father, and all her folk, if she could only contrive to give her Ladyship the genteel slip.\" \" What has come over you, child ?\" demanded"], [100, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 88 Peg, in amaze, arrested in her vigorous operations, and remaining stock-still on her knees, surrounded by costly stuffs of the dyes of the rainbow. Sally blushed a more vivid red \u2014 nearer a sweet william this time, but looking all the prettier in the high colour in company with the clustering chest nut-brown hair and the meditative eyes. \" I'd liefer stay, Mrs. Woffington ; perhaps it is vanity, but I think they miss me at home. My father and mother gave me up with reluctance ; I am of use there, I might as well be a butterfly here, and I'll not continue a butterfly,\" protested Sally pet tishly. \" I am not fit for it ; I was born to be a sober, working girl, and my father promised me that I should write his letters this year, and my mother was to intrust me with the household linen, and, oh, I was teaching Jemmy, the crow-boy, to read, and he was coming on so finely ! It is not so bad here in Dublin, for I have my old aunt to look after, and she wearies for me in the evenings to play her game of cribbage with her ; but I'll be of no use at all at all to her ladyship, who has her own young woman, and will not even allow me to sit up for her, and sew at her embroidery frame. I'll pine away, or I'll get into mischief, and forget my duty, and lose my peace. Indeed, I must tra vel home again.\" \" You good child,\" vowed Peg, with moist eyes, \" I'll tell you what I've read pat to your pur pose in some of my foolish play-books. An Italian"], [101, "Beauty. 89 saint left his estates to his brother, and retired into the cloister. His brother accepted the gift, but proclaimed, sorrowfully, ' Ah ! brother, you've taken heaven, and you've only given me earth.'

You are the first player that I have known ; but I admire you, Mrs. Woffington ; I love you as much as any sweet soul out of my own dear home ;\" and Sally, in a fit of enthusiasm, stooped down and kissed Peg Woffington. Peg was much moved ; she drew back, and covered her face with her hands for a moment, and spoke hastily, in a half-smothered voice : \" My dear, I 'm not angry ; but you don't know what you've done ; you don't know how your lips feel to such a woman of the world as I am.

The Gunnings went to the Castle ball in the borrowed plumes of Peg Woffington, and literally dazzled the assembly by the fairness of their faces. Their success might have intoxicated them ; but I don't find intoxication commonly on the books of Court beauties, only lofty or joyous elation, joined to the greed of a thief for praise and power. The sisters took by storm the listless imagination of her Ladyship, who liked to be roused, and desired, on that account, to convey with her across the Channel an Irish gem to adorn her working-closet and her back drawing-room. Sally Fortescue was suffered to excuse herself from filling the glittering, cold, hard setting, and the Gunnings consented, with all their hearts, to occupy the gaping vacancy. The famous beauties carried out such a raid, and bore off such spoil as only Irish beauties have twice in half a century wrested from close-fisted British hands. The women reached the toppling summit of their am bition, until the blood-royal alone defied the witch ery of their sway ; the strawberry leaves, baubles next to the sceptre, were again and again laid at these feet mincing to conquest. Verily, the Duke who claimed the wide moors and parks of Clydes dale, and the proud peaks of Goatfell, and great"], [103, "Beauty. 91 Macallummore, the Lord of the Isles, submitted to wear the same flowery chains. The Gunnings were the true queens of society. To them both wealth and rank went a begging in their time, as they themselves had gone a begging to Peg Wof fington. Both sisters became famous women of quality. One sister was twice a duchess. Luckier (yes, lucky is the word we play upon), luckier lasses never entered London without a penny ! Sally Fortescue returned as she went to the big house of Deanston. The Squire could not resist a hurrah of glee, though he affected to shake his white head wrathfully. The Squire's lady lec tured Sally soundly, but she held her child to her bosom, and from that moment she renounced the spectacles which she had just assumed, and which bestowed so peculiarly precise and pedantic an air on her comely, matronly face. Sally bloomed on awhile light-hearted, but soon grew sedate, as the only stay of her parents. Then there was a Shane O'Dyer, one of the rank crop of gentlemen farmers who rode and danced for a time after Sally, but he was only a gentleman- farmer of some third cousin of a proprietor. In one of the first erup tions of the rebellion his stack-yard was burnt, his cattle houghed, his hedges broken down, his cabin laid open to the wind and weather. He never recovered the injury ; he was not a man of educated faculties and disciplined resources, only upright and honest, frank and kind, and a mighty hunter ; and"], [104, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 92 he had been hanging his head already at the little encouragement vouchsafed him by Squire Fortes cue. The match was not to be dreamt of then, though Sally was so gende a girl, and young O'Dyer so manly and fond, and possibly the brightest young man in these quarters (you may suppose bad were the parts of the best), that it was believed the girl took the loss to heart. Not so much as he did : the poor young farmer, ruined without redemption, rode a little more desperately than before, sat shivering in his wet clothes in his tumble-down house, began to burn and melt away with fever, swang from side to side in his saddle with weakness, crept to the last to the hillock which commanded a view of the big house of Deanston, died one fine day in his prime. There was no thing seen on Sally, except that her bloom went off\" at once and altogether ; she who had been so sweet a woman in her blushes was ever afterwards a sweet, white-faced woman, who had laid up her brocade in lavender, and only wore her sprigged poplins and muslins Sundays and Saturdays. Peg Woffington had run her course, her meteor course. Alas, alas ! so near the sun the one day ; so far off\" in the blackness of darkness the next. Her generous impulses, her kindly acts were all blurred and obliterated, like stars before inky clouds, in the progress of a life flighty and erring, and degenerating swiftly into riot and brutality. But Peg's fitful light did not leap out in the murky"], [105, "Beauty. 93 night. The poor soul stopped short in her godless, unrighteous career ; she suddenly cried out that she saw the broad way and the pit to which it led, and felt herself sinking to destruction. But she had also a glimpse of the narrow road mounting up to the heights still open to her. How awful it was for her light, dancing feet to retrace the long and weary waste thick set with thorns ! What mock ing voices and malignant faces tortured her on the backward journey she could have told ; but she grasped the rod and leant upon the staff\", and sin cere, meek, and shame-faced in her great repen tance, surely she crossed the gulf, forded the stream, and reached the shore. One old, old acquaintance, reading of Peg Woffington's conver sion and repentance in the idle gossip of a stray news-print of the day, knelt down on her saint's knees, and thanked God for it in her saint's hu mility and gladness. Far away in a castle, nigh a palace in its pride of place by the western shores, surrounded by retainers more deferential and devoted than ever were Saxon subjects, a very great lady entertained an English scholar, and his complacent compagnon de voyage. The great lady had wit enough to be affable to the great Englishman ; but to the little Scotchman, even under her own castle-roof, she condescended to show the cold shoulder. The great lady was so touchy that she could not bring herself to forget and forgive some frivolous offence of the meddling little man's. Thus the"], [106, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 94 rose-leaf of the Sybarite's couch was matched by the trifle that could fret the petted mind of a great lady, whose story had gone like a fairy tale, whose destiny had equalled Cinderella's in splendour. Such pomp and such irritability ; how grand and how irksome ! I have said luckier lasses than the Gunnings never entered London. Do you think their luck was so much worth having, after all, when the luckiest of the Gunnings could not find enough magnanimity to pardon a foolish man's folly ? Was this all their luck brought them to ? a peevish face beneath the strawberry leaves ; an exasperated heart, in which rankled the smallest affront, although that heart beat within the state and dignity of proud castle-walls. Why, a meek and quiet spirit in a body clad in hodden grey, with no better shelter than \" a clay biggin,\" were, if not luckier, a thousandfold more blest. In the heart of Ireland, away in the corner of a big, rickety house, dwindled down into the dwelling of an agent, whose family occupied it in part, a mid dle-aged, serene, dainty single woman was, without the least conscious assertion of authority or influ ence, looked up to and tended by the whole house hold. Although the least domineering of women, the old lady relished her sweet, natural supremacy ; liked dearly to confer favours in the shape of caudles and cakes, and shapes of frills and caps, and was not above receiving gifts in return ; and stepping in next door to look wistfully round the old bare walls, to make much of, and be made"], [107, "Beauty. 95 much of, by her simple, cordial neighbours. In the sanctuary of her own two rooms, that old lady \u2014 the prettiest picture of faded gentility that I can think of \u2014 used to indulge herself sometimes in turning over drawers and cabinets containing relics of the past. They were not worth it ; her own antiquated brocade, the tarnished gilt buttons ofthe Squire, the soiled pearl hoop of the Squire's lady, the hunting-whip which Shane O'Dyer gained at a hunting-match, and insisted on depositing at Dean ston, because he had got no buffet or cupboard to hang it over in his cabin, and which his heirs had likewise decided on leaving at Deanston, because it was where Shane, poor fellow ! would have wished it to remain. The articles were intrinsically value less ; the very associations which they recalled were little worth in themselves \u2014 the gone - by youth, so homely, and often so heavy, the boorish lover ; but these were tender eyes that gazed on them, and the longer they gazed, the more loving, and yet the more contented and clear they became ; for it does not so much matter that there have been foiled hopes and forlorn days here, when the future, with its fulfilment and its restoration, is close at the door.

Few of us are incapable of win ning favour, and few are solicitous to gain it, unless from the basest and most sordid motives. However flattery, too, seems formally on the de cline. Toad-eaters, like blue-stockings, are anti quarian relics ; even humble companions exist in greatest numbers in novels where they manage a good deal of intricate machinery, as the duenna does in the Spanish drama. Favour \u2014 the liking of our associates, the respect of our acquaintances, the confidence of our poorer brethren \u2014 the chief secret of our social influence, is surely worth the seeking. At one time it was elaborately sought. The notion of an attractive woman always included sweetness of temper and an obliging humour. The old favourites, such as"], [109, "Favour. 97 Mrs. Delany, were models of politeness, and real not feigned interest in their fellows. Fiction took the tone from public opinion ; and every heroine, pensive or sprightly, had a mint of friends, and was distinguished by her multitudinous cares for them, and, in return, their grateful devotion to her. The necessity became, doubtless, a plea for popularity, and waxed artificial and overstrained ; but its ab sence in the present day is sufficiently striking and objectionable. Biography and fiction now abound in good, noble, sincere, benevolent women, who are yet singularly isolated in character and position ; who, from pecu liarity of temper or principle, repulse rather than attract their kind ; who begin life by scorning the opinion of the world \u2014 not the wicked world, or the great world, but the little world of their equals and acquaintances ; who will neither bear nor for bear, except as martyrs, and who constitute it rather a merit to be reckoned odd, harsh, careless, cynical, and whose sole available links to their fellow-creatures depend on their generally absorb ing affection for their families, and their most laud able and untiring care for the poor. But surely our blood-relations should not engross us, and the poor are not our only neighbours. In some re spects our companions and fellows in the road of life have a broad claim on us ; and it is with that claim that this paper particularly deals. In the old-fashioned days of our grandmothers G"], [110, "98 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. and great-grandmothers, there was a great profes sion and practice of friendship, breathing of shep herdesses' hats, clematis bowers, and syllabubs. \" The companions of youth\" were more frequently then \" the friends of old age.\" Now, friendship is a thing which it is to be feared many young girls don't think of, except as a convenience and an amusement ; and when the convenience and amuse ment passes, the bond is summarily dissolved. As to sticking to an old friend, although like the crown of England once in a day, she \" is hid in a bush,\" cherishing her, bearing with her, adhering to her long after she has ceased to be prosperous, advan tageous, or even very enlivening \u2014 alas ! how seldom it is well done, how often it is not done at all ; and the want of this sincerity and fidelity lends a peculiar hollowness and meanness to many girls' friendships, deteriorates their natures, de grades their whole beings. These nominal friend ships are most frequently seen in false, pretentious sets and families, full of vain and paltry ambitions ; but they are also seen where they ought in consis tency never to show their faces. Ah me ! to see the young girl, when she ought to be freshest hearted, cunningly courting the girl she considers the best-born or the richest in her school or so ciety ; and woe is me ! for the heartlessness with which she will turn from this queen for another who has more court patronage or a wider territory. In soliciting or neglecting favour there are ne-"], [111, "Favour. 99 cessarily two extremes to be avoided ; the constant pursuit of company, and the determined avoidance of company. The hankering after society, the in- veterate coveting of a stranger's presence in the family group, the running after this or that neigh- bour \u2014 any one, however ineligible, with whom we will change our whole tone in order to accommo- date ourselves to their order of vision, until gradually we have no tone to change, and all to save us from ourselves \u2014 are largely the results of thoughtless- ness, emptiness, and silliness. But remember the two last cannot be cured, they can only be leavened and salted, if possible, with good. In Jane Aus- ten's novel of Persuasion, Anne Elliot early sees the impropriety of the perpetual unceremonious visits, the daily \" looking in\" between the hall and the cottage of the Musgroves senior and the Musgroves junior ; but she judges rightly that she cannot correct them, that her part is to render them as harmless and peaceable as possible. Such an outside life produces the effects seen on con- tinental nations : a broad dash of national charac- ter, with scanty individuality or intensity of any faculty or feeling ; an absence of much fond, true fellowship ; a very light harvest of the human heart. But you must never forget that, with re gard to some dispositions, this light harvest is the only one of which they are capable, and what is left to us is to try hard to have what is of it good, and not mixed with blight and mildew. A perpetual"], [112, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 100 dropping of visits is like gossip, which must receive very varied treatment. A great deal is written in a wholesale way against gossip, and we cannot resist doing honour to Mrs. Stowe for having honestly, cheerily, and charitably defended it. Malicious gossip is evil speaking, and is breaking a command ment \u2014 away with it ! Kindly and thoughtful gos sip is incidental to our interest in, and contact with our race, and is an abundant source of dramatic perception. But that is very far from exhausting gossip, and prattling gossip is almost equally need ful. Talk of fashions, habits, accidents, economy, babies, and the weather, is the limpid flow of a large number of minds ; and shame upon any mind, however strong or however stored, which cannot readily relax to it and luxuriate in it. There is nothing common or unclean, there is nothing really trifling which affects humanity ; the greatest will be the tenderest. Shakspere was a univer sal sympathizer. Sydney Smith could chat with every man, woman, and child in his parish, and be honesdy engaged with them, and so the acute critic and the inveterate joker was beloved with an affluence of affection by high and low, grave and gay, young and old. And, by the by, there is an affectation of condescension which makes curious reservations. A great lady will be familiar with a peasant's wife on her milk and meal and kail-yard, when she will not understand a merchant's wife's anxiety to have the courses of her dinner served"], [113, "Favour. 101 according to established rule and precedent, or to get a carriage-sweep cut out of her pretty flower garden. Clever men will boast rather of playing with children, when they will scout their plodding mothers, or pragmatic fathers. This is far enough from the courtesy to all men ; the delicate, divining rod, which pierces every temper and constitution, and finds there still something that is human, some thing that may be divine. Charles Kingsley, in writing of the goodwill and fervour with which women become missionaries to the lower classes, asks, But who will become a missionary to the girls of the middle-class, to the giddy, gadding girls, the coarse-minded, spiteful girls, the proud, discontented girls who help to fill their ranks ? In the forms of education \u2014 the gram mars and text-books \u2014 the girls of the middle-class are as well trained, and sometimes better disci plined, than the girls of the higher classes. In the spirit of education ; in simplicity in place of pre tence at refinement, in wider society, in foreign travel, in a greater familiarity with both nature and art, in much more time spent in the free, pure air \u2014 the girls of the higher ranks rise far above the ffirls of the middle class. But if \" a touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\" a touch of grace does still more to promote an advancing and indissoluble union. A good girl in the middle class, labouring to have a godly spirit, an upright mind, loving ways, wholesome tastes, has this superiority over"], [114, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 102 \u2022her sister : she is hardier, more independent, and more original. She is not so propped up by artifi cial aids ; she is not so much the individual of a class, carried away by a class movement, full of class prepossessions and prejudices, High Church because she is high bred, and showing a great and laudable charity when she can act gently and tole rantly to Low Church and Dissent. And what a young girl, in the middle-class, may be above all to her companions by dignity, liberality, modesty, and meekness, by truth, generosity, and tenderness ; how she may promote higher tastes, how she may put down lower aims, how she may insensibly and unobtrusively strengthen and enlighten the weak and ignorant, by removing erroneous impressions, confirming fleeting impulses, and, possibly, at last, assisting in the great deed of casting the anchor within the veil, \u2014 all this renders the question of favour a serious and lofty one. The writer would be the first to allow, sorrow fully, that there are many good and true women who, from constitutional reserve and diffidence, or from some unconquerable defect of tone and car riage, feel a blank, as it were, between their asso ciates' instincts and their own, and never attain this favour. Be it so, if it is not their own fault. There are other weapons to work with than mere favour or liking ; and occasionally the most passion ate attachment of a life, the deepest-rooted influ ence of a human history, may be drawn forth and"], [115, "Favour. 103 exhibited at last by one who won no favour, but the reverse, in the beginning. But those who have natural spirit, sweetness, brightness, persuasiveness, are vested with a social lever, and ought to use it heartily to raise the gene ral body of their society. Of course to do any good with this favour, it must be exerted with wisdom, long-suffering, and, most emphatically, with sim plicity and humility. But grand and sweet as these accompanying qualities are, they are certainly to be found if sought at their source. Say, then, whether should a good girl sit in her room reading a book of whatever sort it may be, which she is conscious improves her, or meditating upon her day's lesson, her duty, the kingdom of nature or the kingdom of art ; should she do this, or walk abroad with the foolish friend who is cha grined and depressed at the disappointment of a love affair with some one still more shallow and foolish than herself. If the staid but gracious Jane or Anne will listen and condole, the Dulcibella has a fancy that she would rather go fern-hunting or leaf gathering just now, than shopping or walking in the direction of the railway terminus, the pier, the coach station, or the cricket or golf-ground, with her sisters all chattering without regard to her, or laughing at her for her pure folly. Perhaps if Jane or Anne is a very good and merciful listener, Dul cibella has a glimmering of an idea that she might care to hear about Jane's or Anne's engagements"], [116, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 104 \u2014 her work, her books, her religious and charitable societies, just because she is heart-sick of her own round of life, and she would draw a breath of an other atmosphere. Who knows but that single draught may, with a blessing, refresh and quicken that jaded, torpid, trifling spirit ? Whether should a good girl never stir from home of an evening, even though she devotes an hour or two to a coarse but comfortable Dorcas garment, though she jokes with papa and kisses mamma, and flatly contradicts Aunt Janet for the safety of society, or decide, with a sigh, to join the party where there is little pleasure or perceptible profit for her, but where her presence may keep down some slander and some levity, and perhaps, if one has great faith, bring about some sound sense, and some genuine blitheness ? There is nothing more commendable and enjoyable in Anne Grant of Laggan's moralizing, than her early con viction that her own love of retirement, and what was then called elegant sentiment, and her aver sion to commonplace society and commonplace pursuits, proceeded from a feeling very nearly akin to selfishness. To act beneficially on our neighbours, by our power of inspiring favour, we must keep under our own vanity ; we must be very careful that philan thropy has the place of love of popularity ; we must be earnest to maintain a pure heart and a single eye. But first and last, as the head and tail"], [117, "Favour. 105 of our commission, we must reverence our nei^h bour ; we must not think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think, and while we measure her by ourselves, we must make every allowance for different growth and culture, opposite motive and temptation ; and while we finger the mote in her eye, we must remember, with awe, that there may be a beam in our own, and pray that we may see the great obstruction, and work first on our own grievous infirmity, with all our own might and Another's might, ere we lend to our fellow-creature our gentle, humble, compassionate assistance. We must reverence our neighbour, think well of her, bear long with her, be pitiful to her, and never, to our dying day, presume to judge or condemn her. If there is an offence more detestable than an other, it is to be foul-tongued with regard to those with whom we voluntarily keep company, with whom we share bread and salt, to whom we speak with accents of goodwill, even of affection. If there is a thins to make a man or woman sit down well nigh despairing of human kind, it is to join in a cordial greeting between friends, to hear of mutual benefits conferred, nay, sacrifices incurred, and when one has parted from another, to find the re maining individual coolly and coarsely pull the absent person to pieces, expose his or her frailties, rake up or conjure into being his or her mean nesses, frauds, vices.

They had suffered wrong and sorrow ; it does not signify what, but it sufficed to drive them in upon themselves, and to withdraw them from society. Living thus alone, they lost heart even in themselves. They allowed their pretty house, close by a stream \u2014 a house that Izaak Walton might have loved ; a two storied white house, with a porch and an abund ance of woodbine and traveller's joy, to get over grown, dark, damp, and positively unwholesome. They planted no new flowers in the borders, and the old degenerated into mere buttons of flowers ; they allowed the old avenue to sink into a miry, unfenced country road. The same with their persons ; they wore old-fashioned coats and gowns, always of the same colours ; and these colours waned ever fainter and dimmer, as if the persons who selected them, like owls shrinking from the light, felt all that was bright gradually become more and more unsuitable to them. They attended"], [120, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 108 no public place save the church, and the vicar was a man well up in years, who never struck out a noveltv in his sermon ; and they read in no book club or library. Yet they were not old in years. Thomas, the squire, and Mildred, his elder sister, were only middle-aged, and Lizzie was fifteen years younger, if you could apply any form of the word young to a person who had grown up in such an atmosphere. Their name was Knight, and. it afforded an opportunity of punning to all the wits of the neighbouring town of Craythorpe. For certain, the possessors of the Brook farm had mis taken the spelling of their cognomen ; it ought to have been represented in bank-books and game certificates without the chivalrous, fantastic K. Only one individual at Craythorpe visited the Knights of the Brook, and he was a Knight also, though a Knight springing from a different source. His father and mother did not share his entrance into the chill, shady house. They had been mixed up with the cause of the Knights' retirement from the world ; rightly or wrongly the Knights of the Brook blamed the Knights of Craythorpe for an explosion and exposure which was very bitter to their proud, reserved natures, and a family estrange ment followed. But no family estrangement could prevent Matthew Knight, the doctor's son in Cray thorpe, from being the heir-at-law in entail of his cousin, Thomas Knight, the small squire of the Brook, and some intercourse had taken place in"], [121, "Favour. 109 consequence ; an intercourse beginning in lawyers' offices, and ending in the scarcely less cold, formal, old-fashioned drawing-room ofthe Brook. Thomas Knight, though a morose man, was just in his dealings, and he did not wish to visit the iniquity of the father on the child. Young Matthew Knight became attached to the Brook from love of contradiction, a sense of future possession, and a doomed esteem for his cousins. With Matthew Knight entered the sole glimpse of the laughing, weeping, loving, struggling world that reached the Brook. There had been contest there once, but there was calm now, a dead calm. Lizzie Knight, in her close-fitting grey gown, with the sleeves buttoned tight at the wrists, her hair pressed to her face, passed behind her ears, and screwed into a knot behind, believed Matthew Knight the im personation of manly dash and daring. Lizzie herself was a flower in the shade ; a stinted, scent less flower, with mere traces of fair proportions and free fragrance ; and she had never been so conscious that her life was a species of vegetation, as when Matthew Knight was studying anatomy in France and Germany, and no visitor from Cray thorpe disturbed the utter monotony of the Brook. Yet Lizzie said little or nothing to Matthew, and was the least demonstrative of his undemonstrative cousins. After all, it was strange that Lizzie, who might have been a nun for all she knew of society, and was as demure as a nun in her man-"], [122, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 110 ners, was fully persuaded that there were other and very different spheres from the niche she occupied. It was not from the conversation of Thomas and Mildred ; it was not from the prattle of old ser vants \u2014 old servants are gone-by indulgences ; the Brook servants were all young, and constantly changing their places, though complaining of no thing beyond the intolerable dulness of the Brook, and the ineffable distance that separated them from their master and mistresses. Lizzie's misgivings and inspirations must have been instincts, and they were deep down in her constitution ; no one would have suspected her of entertaining them. Lizzie Knight was judged the most out-of-the-world, tire some, and conceited of all the Knights. Of course Lizzie often formed erroneous con clusions. Dr. Matthew Knight \u2014 Doctor Matthew he was termed, in contradistinction to the old doctor, his father \u2014 was no good sample of mascu line light-heartedness and geniality. Dr. Matthew had a share of the constitutional gloom of the Knights ; he was an only child, and he had a com bative temper. He was one of those men who are belligerent from their birth, and who, while they are too reasonable or good to refuse to be disciplined, contest every step of the progress, punch with their heads, square with their fists, shove with their feet, throughout the process. Matthew disputed with his mother over the cate chism, \u2014 certainly she v/as a dogmatic theologian ;"], [123, "Favour. 111 and he was never chastised by his father without shaking his head defiantly in the very act ot begging the paternal pardon. Now, he stormed over his patients while he cured them, and showed himself perfectly rampant in every public affair in the burgh in which he was called to take an in terest. A good deal of a blast, saturnine and stinging, was Matthew Knight, still there was a breezy life in the masses of dark hair above his square fore head, and he was. not so lost to light and gaiety as not to appear sometimes at the Brook with a blush rose or a striped carnation at his button-hole, and Lizzie had heard, that though he did not dance, he went out occasionally to the quarters where young people most do congregate, and that he had his share of admiration, as every manly character run riot will scarcely fail to obtain. His greatest evidence of vigour and buoyance was in the horses he rode and the dogs he kept. He always rode spirited horses, and he galloped with a keen zest for the exercise, which the dog at his heels shared. It was an autumn day, one of those mellow, gorgeous days which, like autumn flowers, some times excel in splendour ; old earth was brilliant and sunshiny even in her decay, like a good work man who is pithy and jocular over the fulfilment of his work, and puts his best foot foremost at the last, as if to prove what a perfect man he is in his craft, \u2014 how much beauty and refreshment for"], [124, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 112 body and soul lurk under his patience and skill. It was a day when country-people troop to towns to spend their wages, and cheery voices sound from laden carts and half- thatched stacks. The Brook only looked the sadder for the bright luxuriance and gratitude of the world. The cart-road, be tween the lines of trees, leading down from the high road, was all rutted into furrows and troughs, and well-nigh impassable ; but as no wheels drove there except in broad daylight on Sunday, where was the use of filling up the hollows and smooth ing down the heights, far less of mending them with road-metal ? The Knights' bones were well accustomed to being shaken, and there was still a bridle-road left for Dr. Matthew. The garden was dark and disconsolate, only the yellowing leaves of the plums, and reddening leaves of the pears, with the few apples dark-green, and puck ered together like old vinegar-faces, with here and there a brown wall-flower to lend it varying dyes. Lizzie Knight was in the house alone ; Mildred was taking her usual afternoon walk through the fields to look for and bring home Thomas ; one servant was ill, pining as she called it, and gone to her mother's for a change ; the other had been sent on an errand to the town, and was committing the fault so flagrant and incurable in the Brook servants, of dallying to the last moment in her mes saging, loath to return to her sombre kitchen. The clock was heard, with its irksome, importunate"], [125, "Favour. 113 tick, tick, that forlorn substitute for human voices, when there came a ring to the jingling old bell. Lizzie leapt on her seat \u2014 so few people rung the bell ; Dr. Matthew knocked, and those persistent men \" of gentlemanly address,\" travelling for all and sundry, had long given up the Brook as a bad speculation, a lost old place, which never, by the remotest, luckiest accident, wanted anything new. Lizzie smoothed her smooth braids, and softly opened the door, a little put about by performing the unusual service. A stranger stood on the discoloured door-step ; a woman, a girl, a little, brown, warm-cheeked girl, with a little hat on her erect head, a braided jacket on her compact shoulders, a gay Indian scarf knotted round her throat, and a carriage-bag in her grasp. She looked at Lizzie, and Lizzie looked at her. She might be some young lady who had lost her way, but why did she not ask for it ? Lizzie grew red, a watery red, in her white face. The stranger only opened her lips, and showed her even teeth. \" I beg your pardon ; but are you one of the Miss Knights ?\" In such an encounter, Lizzie could have denied her identity ; anything so like an adventure had never happened to\" her in her seven-and-twenty years. \" Yes ; Miss Lizzie Knight,\" answered Lizzie as briefly as if the words cost her a painful effort.

Papa could not stop here, for he must be back in time for the circuit ; but I begged him to let me come out and try my chance. It was a pity not to seize the opportunity of a meeting with my cousins, and I thought it would be nice to take you by surprise. Papa is only fifty miles off, and is to sleep there, so if my visit is inconvenient, you can turn me about my business, and I will be able to overtake him before he starts to-morrow morning.

Lizzie begged Ciss Berry to come in, and faintly signified that she was glad to see her, while everything span round with her at so unheard of a conjuncture. What would Thomas and Mildred say ? What would they do with her ? How long would she mean to stay ? The door of the spare bedroom was locked. Was she Ciss Berry ? whirled through Lizzie's distracted brains. The last distressing uncertainty soon settled itself. Lizzie was timid and fluttered ; she was one to have her pocket picked any day ; she could have been easily decoyed into leaving a disreputable person in the back-kitchen with the silver spoons ; but it was impossible for her to look into the face before her, and fail to see that it was transparent as the day. If Lizzie had ever read Coleridge, she might have been relieved to see her guest cross the threshold without assistance ; but Ciss did not go far, she turned round in the little matted hall. \"Are you sure I'm not putting you about?\" she reiterated, with a pair of friendly, domestic, girlish blue eyes, at a discount with her brown, glowing complexion and dark hair, standing there on the stiff straw matting pleading against herself. \" I am not a bit tired ; I have only travelled a hun dred and thirty miles to-day; I can walk to the railway again without the least fatigue, it will be quite a pleasure ; I had lunch at the station al-"], [128, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 116 ready, I assure you I had, Cousin Lizzie ; for I was as hungry as a working man, with having a run on the rail so early in the morning.

Poor Lizzie blushed all over again one of those purplish, watery blushes. Nobody kissed another at the Brook. Thomas and Mildred had not kissed her above twice in their lives ; once when there had been inexplicable misery in the house, which no child could fathom, though Lizzie had experienced a scared perception of it which she remembered and understood long afterwards. Then, Thomas and Mildred had come into her room one night, and kissed her solemnly, one after another, with blanched lips, as if they adopted her into their communion, and registered a vow in which she was included. Once when she was thrown from her pony, and had lain for ten minutes insen sible, when Dr. Matthew had said she would come round, Thomas and Mildred had kissed her in an"], [129, "Favour. 117 effusion of thankfulness. Of course, every one is grateful and glad over an escape from a dangerous accident and its sad consequences. Dr. Matthew had held her hand after he had ceased to feel her pulse, and involuntarily smoothed her hair when he had done moistening her brow, and no man could accuse Dr. Matthew of a caressing tendency. It seemed quite a matter of course to Ciss Berry that she should kiss her cousin, and chat to her all the way up stairs, and during the moment that Lizzie was reaching down the door-key from the projection above the door. \" Have you thieves here in this country place ? \" asked Ciss. \" No,\" answered Lizzie ; \" but there is never any one here, and Mildred thinks it better to keep the door shut, as it creaks in the wind, and it is easy to go up every day and air the room.\" \" Our rooms never want airing ; that is, they have very often people occupying them to air them for themselves.

Besides, the girls that I was at school with come and see me ; and the girls that were Anne's and Chatty's contemporaries come and see them ; and papa and mamma have their acquain tances, and thus we can be seldom long alone.\" Lizzie was mute, reflecting on this unexampled"], [130, "118 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. dissipation ; while Ciss tilted off her hat with one jerk of her hand, drew off her cloth jacket and appeared in a muslin jacket, buckled round her waist like a boy's with a bronzed leather belt, shook out her net, and looked comically at her boots. \" You keep shocking bad roads, Cousin Lizzie. Are you never spilt ? \" Lizzie looked wildly uncomprehending. Ciss laughed again the girlish laugh that had been trained but not restrained. \" You must forgive me for speaking slang ; all girls who live among boys do, a little, you know ; though mamma says they never thought of such a thing when she was young. Oh, no ! they were precise and sensible people ; and mamma talks yet of ' true blue,' and ' beaux,' and ' happy couples.' \" \" We don't go from home,\" ventured Lizzie. \" Many persons don't visit much,\" chimed in Ciss, meaning to meet her sober kinswoman ; \" and some women are frightened to travel by themselves.

But Ciss flew back again next moment, as if she had run in and out of that bees'-waxed, tightly-tied up apartment, from her earliest infancy. \" Excuse me, pray look here, Cousin Lizzie ; my trunk is at the station, for, you know, you might have been from home ; I only carried this bag, because it contained a few presents which I hoped you would accept, and which I would have left behind me in your absence. You see I medi tated this invasion the moment I looked at Brad shaw, the night before we left Limerick, and I had still light to go out and buy a few trifles.\" \" Oh, dear ! you should not have thought or such a thing,\" protested Lizzie, in trepidation."], [132, "Papers for thoughtful Girls. 120 What was she to do with presents ? How could she receive them from a stranger whom she had never seen before that day ? She had her allowance of pocket-money from Thomas, and spent it with Mildred's advice, and it just covered her expenses ; nay, she was obliged to be economi cal in shoes, which she walked over in a manner that Mildred could not account for. She some times saved enough to buy a half-pound of tea, or a yard of flannel to a poor woman ; that was all she knew about gifts ; but this independent, joyous girl had her presents like her journeys, at her finger ends. \" Here is a coronet for you, Cousin Lizzie,\" holding up a roll of blue velvet ; \" the butterfly-bow on the top ofthe head is the height of the fashion. And this apron is worked with French silks. I hope you like the French silk embroidery ; I thought it might suit Cousin Mildred, as mamma fancied one last year,\" and Ciss glanced doubtfully first at the mushed, rounded, gay wreathed little apron in her hand, and then at the long, black stripe of the same denomination patronized by Lizzie. \" I trust my Cousin Thomas carries a flask, or a telescope, or a pocket- map, when he goes on an excursion, for I could devise nothing for him ex cept one of those leather- straps and Japan cases which papa found so serviceable.

Lizzie had no tact, no capacity, for reading her neighbours' thoughts, and accommodating her own to them : though she was gentle, she was not agreeable. Ciss's face fell for a second, but the cloud passed instantaneously. \" Never mind ; it was very stupid of me not to procure something better. I must get another recipient for my strap. ' It's not lost that a friend gets.' You are acquainted with that proverb ? I should not care to keep it to myself ; I have never anything handy ;\" and Ciss buckled it over one shoulder, and looked so far the nattiest little tourist that ever started for the mountains. \" Oh!\" cried Lizzie. \"Dear! It's quite common!\" Ciss assured her. \" Girls carry their waterproof cloaks and their pencils by such means constantly. I saw girls with them over and over again, when we were at the Lakes.\" \" Irish ! \" murmured Lizzie, as if she were saying \" Egyptian.\" \" Not at all ; they were strangers like myself."], [134, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 122 I wonder you have never tried the plan ; before I knew of it, I had always to borrow one of the boys' fishing-baskets to convey my traps ; there again, Cousin Lizzie, I'm afraid you consider me a romp or an Amazon I \" \"Oh, no!\" hesitated Lizzie; \"but I'm not very familiar with young people.\" \" And you one of them ? \" remonstrated the un daunted Ciss. \" Do try on your coronet, and convince me that I have not been mistaken in all my enterprises.\" Lizzie fumbled about the velvet with trembling fingers ; but Ciss nimbly relieved her of the adorn ment, arranged it with her own expert hands on Lizzie's head, standing on tiptoe pulling and pinch ing and patting at the stuff, and, in her zeal, in flicting a good many smart tugs and twitches on Lizzie's fair hair, dressed according to a mode in utter discordance with the rich roll above the purpling face. Lizzie stood like a victim ; she was so sensitive all over, that even a strain to that over-fine flaxen hair caused the tears to rise in her eyes, and Ciss was unconsciously occasion ing her torture. \" There now, Cousin Lizzie, I do declare you would not know yourself.\" Certainly not. Lizzie Knight had never in all her life before seen herself under the guise of a patient, dejected queen. She stood before the oval mirror half fascinated, half disconcerted."], [135, "Favour. 123 \" You're like some character I've seen on the stage. Who could it be ? Not Queen Mary, of course, or Cleopatra ; Cleopatra would be dark, like me. Oh ! Queen Katharine ; King Henry's forsaken Queen Katharine; Cousin Lizzie, you're her picture.\" To tell a sedate, formal woman of seven-and twenty that she represents a tragedy-queen to the life, does not tickle her vanity, or meet with her approval. Lizzie began quickly to disembarrass her head, but Ciss arrested her. \" I must have the cream of the beverage first, Cousin Lizzie;\" and Ciss kissed Lizzie again amidst roguish laughter. Lizzie did not like it much ; she thought it was taking a liberty with her, though Ciss was not a child, was not above four or five years Lizzie's junior ; at the same time there was something strangely novel and attractive in the fearless fami liarity and fondling affection ofthe girl. Lizzie walked down stairs with Ciss in her white jacket and netted hair ; saw her sit down in the window before the spindle-shanked work table ; heard her remark on the view, and ask if dahlias and hollyhocks would not grow in the Brook soil, as if the scene was a dream. After all, Thomas and Mildred were not so amazed, stunned, and thrilled with the apparition as Lizzie had been ; though they were a white haired, ashen- faced man and woman now, they"], [136, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 124 could recall the time when such visions had not been rare at the Brook ; they could avail them selves of long slumbering experience and company manners, once formed, and still in existence, though fallen into extreme disuse. Ciss broke the even tenor of their life, and they were plagued how to dispose of her without outraging hospitality and the ties of blood ; but they did not hold their breaths, or flush into a fever like Lizzie. And it was ex traordinary how soon the Knights became disbur dened of the fretting sense of a charge in which they could neither give nor receive satisfaction from the untoward occurrence of having a gay young girl suddenly landed among them ; how soon they grew reconciled to the presence of a stranger, on ground untrodden by strangers for a score of years ; how soon they learned to welcome the bright face at their elbows, the disposition, habits, dress, so unlike their own, and sported so lightly before them. It can only be accounted for by the innate, indestructible sociability of human nature, and by the exceeding pleasantness of Ciss Berry. Perhaps Lizzie longest resisted the charm, was offended by the girl's ease, and jealous of the simplicity with which Ciss made herself at home at the Brook, and proffered services, which it had been formerly Lizzie's sole part to pay, but which Thomas and Mildred now allowed from an inter loper like Ciss with flickering smiles. Ciss, the new- found relative of a fortnight's"], [137, "Favour 125 existence, claimed favours which Lizzie never ventured to solicit from her natural protectors in all these years, and the care-worn, taciturn elders granted them after scarcely a moment's discussion, with still smoother brows and blander mouths. It seemed to Lizzie that as old people delight to sit in the rays of the sun, so Thomas and Mildred liked to bask in this girl's cheerfulness. It was doting in them ; it could not but pain Lizzie. But Lizzie took herself to task for the unamiable grudge, and rapidly found herself yielding to the broad attraction. You sometimes hear it said of a man or woman, that the individual can make himself or herself happy anywhere, and thence, it may be added, this person is popular everywhere. Ciss was such a one ; I would like her character to be rightly un derstood, if I could make it plain. It was no more perfect than her irregular face, with its brunette richness, and its limpid blue eyes ; but it bore with it more elements of influence, it effected more marvels than many a nature far higher and deeper. My notion is that Lizzie Knight's nature, cramped as it was, was the finer of the two ; but Lizzie was entirely self- concentrated, and, unless indi rectly, never touched others. Ciss was mercurial, volatile, vain. I am sorry to say, vain with that sweet vanity which craves approbation rather than admiration, affection rather than passion. I believe one source of Ciss's unexpected appearance at the"], [138, "126 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. Brook was her ambition for universal conquest. She had heard of her cousins as morbid, inacces sible people, and she was spurred upon her fate by the desire to achieve a famous victory. Ciss was not profound, she was not sensitive, she was not constant with the devoted constancy of full, still natures. There was a light in which Ciss, as \" everybody's body,\" disappointed and vexed you. But although you were angry with Ciss for being as happy to-day with the individual who is your antipodes as she was with you yesterday ; though you were hurt to hear how speedily she had for gotten you, and how blithe she had been without your presence, while you had been moping in her absence ; still, I would have defied ninety-nine out of the hundred to have steeled themselves against Ciss's loveableness. She was as welcome as flowers in spring, which, though they blossom for other eyes than yours, and have a fleeting perfume you prefer to June roses. The reason lay in the circumstance that Ciss was delightful from a most gracious virtue. I have told her faults first, my \" wandering darling,\" because I don't want to im pose her upon you as better than she really was, because I want to point out to you a truth that may wound you sharply one day, if it break upon you unawares. The praise of man is not like the praise of God ; it is not given to the worthiest, the most self-denying, the most laborious ; it is given to certain qualities which bind a man to his kind, \u2014"], [139, "Favour. 127 qualities which are in themselves desirable and valu able, but which are not the holiest or the highest. Ciss had large confidence in her fellows ; she had an immense stretch of sympathy with them. Such a faculty of faith in her neighbour, though it was an unquestioning, superficial, sometimes almost irre verent faith ; such a power of interest in his infin itely varied inclinations, though it was a temptation to latitudinarianism and desultoriness, was a low, smirched edition ofthe Apostle's \" all things to all men,\" and was a vast gain even to an inspired apostle. It was something pleasing and profitable to see how Ciss sidled herself into the hearts at the Brook ; with what address she adapted herself to the slug gish currents and grave volume of its stream ; how perseveringly she occupied and amused herself in matters she had never attempted before ; and was actually enamoured of homeliness and seclusion, and as radiant at the end of several quiet weeks as on the day of her arrival. The inhabitants of the Brook would not have been flesh and blood if they had not been flattered and stirred by the advent of this errant star in their orbit, and its continued brilliance in their course. Mildred ransacked her repositories in order to initiate Ciss in her old fancy-work, and was almost as much excited by Ciss's stitches in point and her rug fringe, as she had been by her own nigh thirty years before. Thomas hired a gardener, and de puted Ciss to supply him with orders and direc-"], [140, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 128 tions. He had out the old box of a phaeton on a week-day, and startled Craythorpe into a report that he was about to take to himself a young wife, by driving Ciss, in her gay hat, with one of her various jackets, through the town to the downs, which was the drive for strangers in his nonage. Lizzie encouraged Ciss to hang upon her skirts, and chat vivaciously, in her functions as deputy housekeeper, and went the length of trusting her with the composition and firing of a' tea-cake, which, be it confessed, Ciss found and left raw, after roasting its crust to a cinder ; nevertheless, every one ate of it, and insisted it was very good \u2014 considering. The very servant-girls, plough men, and herds, smirked and sniggled to Miss Ciss, who was always turning up amongst them, asking their assistance, questioning them about their em ployments and recreations, and wishing them good speed. The maid-servants affirmed she was some thing like a pretty, lively, young lady ; and it was something like a house to live in when Miss Ciss was despatching them at all hours to Craythorpe for odds and ends of ribbon and lace, feathers and flowers, gum and paint, paper and books, for un doubtedly Ciss was very often busy on light stitch ing and study on her own behalf. She was per petually changing the shape of those flimsy jackets, and sleeves, and collars. She was incessantly constructing new and enchanting puffs and ruffs, knots and rosettes. Besides all this, she executed"], [141, "Favour. 129 pin-cushions for every member ofthe family, from Thomas (Ciss maintained her point this time, and insisted she had known men who hoarded pins) down to the poultry-girl who chased the young chickens from the wheat, of every material, from cut velvet, the feuille morte of the ancients, down to merino. She dotted the house over with urn mats, anti-macassars, and Affghan blankets, as if the severe old Brook had been smitten by a fancy bazaar. Thomas displaced the encumbrances softly, and even lifted some of them between his finger and thumb, and looking at them, with his grim face inclined sideways, inquired, \" What pretty things are these, Ciss ? I'm afraid they're useless, though they're like yourself.\" What trumpery it was ! and yet there was a place found for it at the ru^ed old Brook, as there was a place in Nature's chorus for the little robin that invaded the Brook's leaf-strewn garden, and lilted its autumn song so shrilly. The robin and Ciss bore a family likeness to each other ; Ciss in her finery recalled the little bird jerking and pluming itself in its pretty feathers, as well as the downy buds bursting on a summer-day. Lizzie had often wondered what Dr. Matthew would think of Ciss Berry, and the first time he met her at the Brook he was, by force of contrast, more cynical than ever, scoffing at Ciss's frail wares, and distinctly inferring that she could do nothing more worthy of her womanhood. But 1"], [142, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls 130 Ciss never minded him, any more than the little birds mind the fuming, stamping ox. \" Sweetly sang the birds aboon, Care never minding.\" Ciss proceeded with her airy trifles, rather inno cently flaunting them in his bronzed face than making any effort to conceal them, and laughing without the slightest dread or shame. But though Dr. Matthew was very scornful, he could not refrain siom bestowing on Ciss the same gift which the savage Dean presented to his beautiful Miss Kelly \u2014 Spanish liquorice for her cold. Ciss stood in as great need of it as another ; she was not one of those well-balanced persons who can always keep themselves well. Ciss was as hoarse as a raven the one day, had a stiff neck the next, and a sprained foot the third ; and remained ener getic and gay throughout a catalogue of calamities. It would have done any doctor, who waged war with nerves, megrim, and loud lamentations, abun dance of good only to behold her. Ciss took the liquorice as if its transfer was no surprise to her. I believe, in her own lavish fashion, she afterwards endowed Dr. Matthew with her despised strap, and he laughed and stretched it in his large hands, and snapped it in two, but he carried off the fragments. \" What a Hotspur of a fellow Cousin Matthew is ! \" observed Ciss in retirement. \" Is he an ad mirer of yours, Cousin Lizzie ?\""], [143, "Favour. \u25a03' Lizzie denied the charge strenuously, and won dered that Ciss could take such an absurd notion into her head. \" Very well, then, I may set my cap at him myself,\" proposed Ciss jauntily. \" I rather like to play gentle Zephyr to rude Boreas ; besides, you know, he is fair game, a kind of connexion of mine.\" Ciss found everybody connected with her ; if they had not mutual blood relations, they had mutual friends and acquaintances. It is in my mind if she had encountered the Imaum of Muscat, she would have established a relation with him through some wandering Arab. That was one reason why Ciss was never introduced to man, woman, or child, without, like Sydney Smith, being in confidential communication with them within half an hour, on the basis of that minute network of family ties. But Ciss need not have made a pretence of availing herself of a connexion ; there are some people who begin as babies to set caps, and go on setting them in every direction with the utmost success, until they are incapable of either setting or pulling caps any longer. Ciss was one of them. \" Let me see if young ladies can perform a reasonable service beyond being flattered and fooled by wretched old women, to whom they dole half pounds of rice and half-a-dozen yards of calico, and- who grin maliciously at ' the pretty, good ladies' the moment their backs are turned,\" cried"], [144, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 132 Dr. Matthew in his domineering way, and taking in Lizzie in his sweeping censure as a cloak to his purpose of confounding Ciss. He had come in with a tale of a poor child that had fallen over a quarry, and sustained sundry grievous bruises and fractures, while its mother was working in a potato field five miles off, and nobody left at home but another incompetent scared little child to execute his orders, and watch by his patient till the mother's return. The bullying doctor was foiled ; up jumped Ciss, dragging Lizzie along with her ; off\" she started at a minute's notice ; nothing stayed her, nothing overcame her. She smiled upon the child whose bandages and mingled patience and restlessness caused Lizzie's heart to flutter, her hand to shake, and her eyes to grow dangerously dim ; she made herself mistress of the barren ter ritory and the blundering little sister. Ciss did nothing wonderful, but the sufferer became hope ful ; the attendant ready, under her familiar, free, blue eyes. The mother would have been sour as a crab at any other mortal who had interfered with her child, without producing a right in the shape of stores of medicine and meats ; but Ciss had not taken time to collect these, and dared not apply them without consulting Dr. Matthew's will and pleasure ; still the woman accepted the foreign volunteer, and accepted her solely from her fluent accents, her open looks, her light, quick tread and touch. Ciss was heartily welcome, where Lizzie"], [145, "Favour. 133 was never received without distrust. Ciss might go every day, with or without drugs and dainties, and be entertained with increasing regard both by mother and baby ; while Lizzie, however benevo lently laden, was barely tolerated. It is some ex cuse for this gross partiality, that Ciss had within herself the unshaped materials for a glorious nurse; while Lizzie, with her queries, her doubts, and terrors, would never be fit for a nurse to a less determinedly sanguine and constitutionally con tented patient than Ciss herself. After that task, Dr. Matthew and Ciss were on what might be called friendly terms; but he always treated her as a child, and Ciss lifted the cue which he dropped to her without objection ; she inter terrupted him, challenged him, startled him, wildly and wilfully, according to her humour. Lizzie looked on as at an idle farce, of which the perfor mers would weary in a day. Dr. Matthew was not the first growling philosopher who had unbent and played his play ; but Lizzie Knight had never witnessed the game, or dreamed of the conclusion. Lizzie sank back in her chair, thankful for the twilight which hid her consternation, when Ciss came to her, one afternoon, and, without any very unbecoming confusion or rigid assertion of calmness, with nothing but girlish confidence, and most light hearted assurance, announced to her that Dr. Matthew wished her (Ciss) to marry him; \"and I suppose I must, Lizzie, for you know I must"], [146, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 134 marry somebody or other one day ! \" Ciss was about to commit wedlock with a man, in her rage for conferring favours ; and to hear Dr. Matthew talking of his proposal, he was, in his surliness, little short of her in his submission to an obligation. \" A doctor, like a minister, could not do without a wife, ergo, a wife was an incumbent imposition ; and, for Miss Ciss, she rather needed to be looked after.\" Then Ciss had her jibe about bolting heads and broken bridles, and he had his retort, foolish, if it were not somewhat brutal, of the whip-hand. It was all a distress to Lizzie, and yet Thomas and Mildred were not only satisfied, but elated, and audibly congratulated each other on the happy, good-natured child Ciss's being arrested in her far ther flight, and established near them. Nobody was shocked ; nobody was hostile ; Dr. Matthew's father and mother yielded to the contingency as affably as if Ciss had been Thomas Knight's daughter or sister instead of his young cousin, as if her rejection and disparagement would imply the cutting off Dr. Matthew with the unimproved acres of the Brook without a shilling of ready money to expend upon them. Dr. Matthew's father and mother advanced the length of extend ing the olive-branch over Ciss's unreflecting head, and fitting out an embassy of conciliation and re conciliation to their offended cousins, whose sore wrath had long frozen into a stony feud. Tho mas and Mildred Knight, stubborn as the cruelly"], [147, "Favour. 135 exasperated righteous often are, narrowing and shrinking fast into a few hard, corroded lines, rose up and stretched their bonds, and went forth slowly and stiffly to meet their commonplace, calculating kindred, to whom the past, with its fiery brand on the one house, had been to the other as a tale that was told \u2014 for Ciss's young sake. \" They might have spared our honour, A^ildred ; they might have joined with us to conceal a poor sinner's defalcation,\" exclaimed Thomas, in his old, high, unwavering key ; but his eye fell on Ciss's bravery, and flickered as eyes will blench before the toys of a child. \" Well, we will not poison her pleasant cup, poor Ciss ; we will even let by gones be bygones for her sake and Matthew's ; these people may come and go as they like to the Brook for me.\" In reality Ciss picked up the fallen lines, unra velled the warped skein, wove anew the old, spoilt pattern, and all the time she had no consciousness of her merits, no conviction of her mission ; she was only a pleasant child, desiring to captivate Dr. Matthew's worldly father and mother, and that not so much for love of him as from a genius for captivation, as she had captivated the unworldly cousins at the Brook. Nay, but Dr. Matthew and Ciss, with their respective impulsive, unnoticing tempers, remarked Lizzie's unpropitiatory gravity and dullness, in the first renewal of tokens of amity between the two families, and settled that"], [148, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 136 Lizzie, harmless as she was, would never be a peace-maker, though the entire world were by the ears. Lizzie, pooh ! a passion-struck, incapable nonentity. Yet Lizzie was the noble ally who marched into the enemy's camp to support the self-interested bearers of the flag of truce. Lizzie was wounded, neglected, ridiculed ; Lizzie was one of those of whom the world is not worthy. Dr. Matthew and Ciss's love-affair did not always flow smoothly : as Ciss had apprised Lizzie of her intended union, it was Ciss's turn next to in form Lizzie, with much the same brilliant, healthy blushes, and perplexing, inseparable mixture of fun and feeling, and not more than a dash of displeasure and alarm, that Dr. Matthew teased her, found fault with her for being agreeable to more amiable men ; she did not think she could permit it to go on ; she could not tell what would be the end of it. Lizzie looked at Ciss with her own troubled eyes, round which the circles had grown to an olive darkness on her wan, fair cheeks. Lizzie lay re flecting in anguish and horror in the dead of the night, long after Ciss slept as soundly as a child. Would it not be better for this ill-matched pair that something should come of this lovers' quarrel, that the little cloud should increase, lower, blacken, discharge thunder over their heads and split them far asunder? They were unlike ; they had been caught by mere fancies. But then Lizzie, ignorant and inexperienced as she was, had an inspiration which"], [149, "Favour. 137 whispered to her in a true voice that Dr. Matthew's fondness for Ciss might be the gleam of sun shine athwart a harsh nature ; withdraw it, and the turbid tide might never again brighten and send up sparkling, life-giving air-bubbles to the clouded surface. And Ciss had her exquisite tenderness for the rough man who had softened to her ; she had been crying before she fell asleep, and her tangled hair was still wet with tears, though it was now pressed into a cheek, round and rosy with the flush of profound and perfect repose. Was the grace of Ciss's character to be shed at a blow ? Was her sprightliness to harden into levity, and her winning, honest good-will to degenerate into the specious, immovable, unfeeling good-nature of a mere popularity-hunter ? Lizzie wept, and prayed that she might never see that end. Lizzie did more ; she walked into Craythorpe, and returned by the winding lanes, in whose laby rinth she was certain to fall in with Dr. Matthew and his bay-horse careering along like a whirlwind. Lizzie arrested him, though she was so nervous a woman that she quaked in every limb, while he had not the courtesy to alight, and his steed kept pawing and prancing around her. \" Why have you not been out to the Brook these three days, Matthew ? We've all missed you. \" I thought some of you might have sought better company,\" retorted Dr. Matthew sullenly,"], [150, "138 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. advancing, retreating, swerving to right and to left with his fiery horse. Lizzie supposed she was standing there at the risk of her life, but she gave a little laugh. \" I wonder you can be so exacting, Matthew ; the dews fall on many flowers, the moon shines for the whole world.\" Dr. Matthew's eyes gave a flash at the words, though he was no more given to the appreciation of poetic similes than Lizzie was to the use of them ; but there are circumstances in a vehement man's life when he takes kindly to figures. Dr. Matthew suddenly pulled up his unruly horse, and leapt off\". \" She will go more quietly when I'm not on her back,\" he explained; \"she's not accustomed to walk with my weight; she knows that there's a pair of us bent on our goal,\" and Dr. Matthew turned and walked with Lizzie. He did not make another allusion to Ciss, neither did Lizzie ; but he was unusually con siderate and kind to his cousin. He even said, \" You're tired, Lizzie,\" and offered her his arm, assuring her that his horse would preserve a polite distance ; and really, to see how the high-stepping horse was upon good behaviour, and walked at a foot's pace behind her master, without taking any greater liberty than an occasional whinnying over the arm round which her rein was flung, was en couraging."], [151, "Favour. 139 Lizzie walked in a dream, much as she had sat with Ciss on the first day of Ciss's arrival at the Brook. When they approached the Brook, Ciss issued from the avenue. She did not display the least tremor ; it was an odd relief to see her ad vancing so cordially and merrily. She said directly, \"I've been looking out for you; you've been long of coming,\" and went round to Dr. Matthew's disengaged side, and took hold of his arm. He was too much encumbered to go on as Ciss intended ; but it was Lizzie's hand he dropped, not Ciss's, though he amended his fault the follow ing moment by proposing to mount Ciss on \" Highflyer,\" to get her out of his road. But Dr. Matthew hastily refused to make the dry joke a practical one, when Ciss begged him to put his threat into execution. \" She's not used to women, \u2014 like her master ; I would not trust you upon her, unless she was re gularly broken for months. Ciss, Ciss, don't go so near her ; don't you hear ? keep away from her hoofs ! \" and Dr. Matthew, who rode on his own account, as the son of Nimshi drove, \" furiously,\" was so little inclined to be rash in another's person, and that other Ciss, that he whirled her round into the middle of the road, with an anxious droop of the mouth, and start of moisture to the brow. Dr. Matthew and Ciss married as they proposed, and if society had nothing else to say in favour ofthe match, it allowed that it was at least a blessing that"], [152, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 140 Dr. Matthew had found a wife who did not nourish a scruple of fear of him. Dr. Matthew and Ciss thenceforward ruled society on two directly oppo site principles. Dr. Matthew governed it with a rod of iron, and held it at bay ; Ciss man\u0153uvred it with a shepherd's crook wreathed with flowers, and brought its members trooping gladly, like flocks of sheep, to her feet. Ciss was the most popular woman within three counties, and her husband proportionably envied. What, in spite of her scrapes ? \u2014 even in spite of her scrapes. A bold, blithe child like Ciss, who puts her hand into every dish, is scorched and scalded, not by scores, but by hundreds of times. You have seen the mischief which a lively child generally contrives to create in a house ? Just such was Ciss's mischief in the world ; but who bears malice against the child ? who would give up the child, though it were to pull down the house about our heads ? who can even forget what light, and zest, and spirit, and fun, and fondness the child brings with it into the house ? So the inhabitants of Craythorpe, Dr. Matthew's father and mother, the family at the Brook, truly and fully forgave Ciss her numerous involuntary offences. They would have been so dull and cheerless without her ; they would have wanted so much of the wine and scent of their lives. Husband and wife had their discords ; Ciss, with her accessibility, her obliging humours, her absence of perception of natures less hardy and"], [153, "Favour. 141 sunny than her own, tried her husband as we all try each other. Dr. Matthew would cut the gor dian knot with imperial decision and violence, and although Ciss was not capable of conceiving a shade of apprehension where he was concerned, she was susceptible of being hurt by her husband's despotism. Then Lizzie Knight, a stiff, still maiden lady, whom everybody voted a bore, was the mediator between them, as she had been in the days of their courtship, and so successfully that they forgot her very existence in the perfect fulfilment of her office ; they forgot the office itself, and the need of it, and would have been extremely indignant \u2014 Dr. Matthew like a bear, Ciss like a shrieking sparrow \u2014 if any invidious individual had ventured to hint that they were not the happiest couple in the world. I should expect that Dr. Matthew at the close of his life, looking back on the long period that Ciss had brightened its atmosphere and dispelled its malaria, feeling how her presence had planted and nourished slips of faith and hope, would leave it as his dying testimony, \" We have been very happy together, Ciss ; we have been the better of each other, my darling;\" and Ciss would assent eagerly through her sobs, and Lizzie Knight, catching the words, would clasp her hands on them, in her solitary home, and call herself blest. If Ciss's gifts of sweetness were thus potent, straying and straggling and spending themselves"], [154, "142 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. according to their frail will, what would they be, guided by unerring wisdom ?

AMBITION. \" Let girls learn everything, and one thing well,\" observed philosophic, keen, self-satisfied Lady Morgan ; herself an example to what acute ness, perseverance, audacity, and a joyous tem perament can carry a woman ; that is, to a certain height and no farther, to be admired but not reverenced, to be courted for her wit, and yet laughed at ! Yes, laughed at loudly, because we need much weightier ballast than wit to preserve us from being supremely ridiculous, and we must show our neighbours other qualities than confident philosophy and overbearing good-humour, before they will be very tender of our foibles. But that little woman was wonderfully well disposed and good-natured, with rather a metallic good-nature ; and there was a considerable amount of truth in her judgment. Take it with qualifications : \" let girls learn everything (they can), and one thing"], [156, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 144 thoroughly\" (if they have peculiar faculty, ambi tion, and steadfastness). The ignorance of the presence or absence of any decided bent of talent, is a proof of the defec tive nature of much that we call education. At the same time, a strong inclination generally makes itself visible, as the horse-leech cries, \" Give, give!\" and it is only negligence, inertness, strong prejudice, or a contrary current of motives and desires, which renders it overlooked. The writer has written before to those girls who have no particular gist but the best gift ; the great smiling, melting gift of grace and goodness, if they will. She would now speak to those who, like the wise woman in Proverbs, may bring their food from afar, and, with their own hands, plant vine yards ; of the honour and happiness of vindicating such powers, and the disgrace and sorrow of wast ing them, and allowing them to rust in idleness and darkness. Our Maker bestowed on us no subtle perception or fine skill to have it folded up in a napkin, be cause He is an austere Man, and rules according to His pleasure among the armies of heaven and the children of men. The presence of design, constructiveness, potent sympathy, and pleasant humour ; the endowment of special language ; the capacity of painting thoughts and feelings, or draw ing them out in chords and harmonies ; the genius of government, by which a woman may become a"], [157, "Ambition. 145 poor-law commissioner, or a guardian of a work house, with no loss, but great benefit to the public; the mere existence of these qualities in women, like the presence and development of teeth, both carni vorous and herbivorous, in the flesh-devouring, vegetable-eating animal, man, is not only a warrant, but an injunction for their use, though not for their abuse. How woman can ever feel ashamed of such good and glad crowns ; how man can ever cry shame upon them for wearing their natural adornment (as much their natural adornment as the hair of their heads), and for wielding their natural sceptre, of which men reap the full advantage, are among the disheartening anomalies which have continued to exist in the middle of freedom, intelligence, bene volence, and Christianity. Perhaps it is because we have loved womanliness so well, that we fear even what seems to tarnish its meekness and modesty ; in which case, let the doubt be amply forgiven, though surely it is an unworthy doubt, like that which prevents a Christian from inquir ing into the proofs and reasons of the faith which is in him, or from summoning science to walk in its proper place, hand-in-hand with revelation. Womanliness, to be true, gentle, loyal, and docile, must be stupid and silly ! A strange compliment to innocent, delicate womanliness, when ignorance is not innocence, and helplessness is involuntary, not voluntary submission. Indeed, there are no such sadly obstinate wights as narrow-minded K"], [158, "146 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. worthies ; no such vain though kindly feather heads as flourish over shallow and weak brains. When you cannot help them, make the best of them ; establish them on goodness, and their de fects will be, by comparison, of little consequence, and your own forbearance will do you a vast deal of good ; but to exalt defects over perfections, is to call evil good and good evil, bitter sweet and sweet bitter. Again, there is no royal road to mathematics. A girl may have the gift in her ; but to cultivate and expand it, and cause it to bear fair flower and fruit, she must be patient, diligent, and self-deny ing ; she must encounter a great deal of drudgery, and overcome some misunderstanding and a good deal of temptation. And this is just what many of our girls fear to do. Speak to your young listener, bright, interested, capable or enthusiastic with a struggling enthusiasm, with that inexpressible, unimaginable, natural facility in what she is doing, of the independence she may attain, the pleasure she may bestow, the good she may do by the study which is so much an instinct and an affection with her, and if she is worth anything she will open wide her eyes, eager and uplifted ; but honestly point out the difficulties and sacrifices she must expect to face, and she is unduly depressed and disheartened.

What ! shrink from being a painter because you cannot at once gad in the streets with other girls, and sit at the easel ? Renounce the wish and prayer to be a writer, and help, comfort, and enter tain others as they have aided, solaced, and en livened you, because you must rise early and lie down late, cannot afford this ball or that prome nade, or, if you do attend the one or the other, be dubbed by the ancient title of Blue-stocking, and avoided or slighted by the vulgar, small men and women ? Lose your chance of becoming a natu ralist, experienced and indefatigable, because you must make your researches alone, or at rare inter vals with a companion, while, if you only walked for a complexion, or an appetite, or to talk of acquaintances and partners, or, at the utmost, to seek a greenhouse bouquet from my Lord's gar dener, or pheasants' feathers for your hat from his gamekeeper's wife, you would have six, twelve, as many as you wished, of chattering, laughing associates, not looking strange upon you, not pro ceeding to taboo you by the whisper that \" Mar garet wants to be out of the common, sets up for a woman of science as she did at school ; and if she does, let her, she may go her own way alone, and welcome !\" Desert the alms-house, the hos pital for sick children, the industrial school, the"], [160, "148 Papers for Thoughtful Girls.

This might be what one would be prepared for from laziness, languor, frivolity, worldliness ; but it is not what one is entitled to claim from health, strength, bravery, cheeriness, faith. It is simply a disgrace to a girl to renounce her birthright, a disgrace, and an act of self-indulgence, disobedience, and irreverence ; but I am afraid it will be often done until we recognise the gift broadly, desire to have more individuality among our girls, and recognise other prizes for them than comfortable marriages. But what is to hinder them from marrying hap pily, among the happiest of the happy, while they are showing themselves gifted, industrious, suc cessful, and meek in their success ? The supposi tion proceeds from a different basis, \u2014 a tendency which Charles Dickens commented on in Little Dorrit, \u2014 that agreeable salve to vanity, in accord ance with which the ordinary partner in the firm was disposed not to allow to the extraordinary mechanical genius the use of common capacity in the management of common affairs ; astonished that he should keep intelligible accounts, be plain, punctual, and painstaking in every-day business,"], [161, "Ambition. 149 like less-endowed men.

But it rests with young girls to remove or con firm this prejudice, and they must be watchful in their ambition, \u2014 watchful for the honour of their callings, and the Master of every art and faculty. In the first place, their aim must have an end, and that end must not be selfish vanity, or, surer than any other Nemesis to a woman, the fruit of their attainment will be apples of Sodom, and grapes of Gomorrah.

Clear as day, her first lie in her domestic ties.

Is she a sister ? she must first be a fond, faithful sister, confidante, assistant, nurse, playmate, before she need meddle with modelling in clay, or wielding workman's tools.

But once let the woman's primary duties be fulfilled, and then let her zealously and religi ously cultivate her gift in a hopeful, persevering;, devout spirit, recognising God in the kingdoms or art, nature, science, and social life, and believing fully that He has work for her to do in one or more of them. It would be hard to express in too strong lan guage what a calling, taken in a proper spirit, may be to a woman ; how healthy- and happy, and useful and beautiful it may make her life ; how her fine, sensitive organism, shielded by faith and meekness, may bear the brunt of the worries and animosities, the difficulties and struggles to which it exposes her, better than the roughness and insensibility of most men.

A DREAM OF HONOUR. What a pleasant dream was that of the milk maid over her basket of eggs ; how they were to be converted into chickens, fowls, geese, lambs, flocks of sheep, calves, stalled oxen, a farm wav ing with russet wheat, and blooming with blue potato-blossom; the green gown which was to captivate \" Colin, my dear,\" and \" Colin, my dear,\" in person, crowning the pyramid !

But there are other dreams than these airy, selfish visions. They may not be known in your philosophy, but I hope that you've either had an inkling of them in your best and bravest hours, or else that they will yet come to you with more fully matured powers, and a wider range of vision. I know, poor souls ! you will not have these dreams unalloyed, untarnished ; you will not see them ful filled without many an unwilling interview with a gruesome servant, whom people name \" the pale Leah,\" the \" withered hag,\" disappointment ; but dream on, nevertheless, like Leah's rival's son, and cheer yourself in the process with the homely, vigo rous proverb \u2014 \"Who bodes himself a silk, gown, Is sure to wear a sleeve oTt.\" Madge Haliburton sat dreaming, dreaming one sultry summer night, at the window of a house looking out on an old sea-washed cathedral. It was a little town, full of poor or pompous folk ; but the massive arches, the rarely-carved doorways and windows of the ruin, whose living glory was departed, brought art-students to the neighbour hood, and gave a slight art bent to the society of substantial or mean professional men and shop-"], [168, "156 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. keepers. The cathedral gave a direction to Madge Haliburton's task and talents. She was a clever creature, Madge ; but, like those architects of the middle ages, who built because of Strasburgh and Milan, Madge probably painted because of the symmetry of tower and belfry, and the perfect colouring of the brown old stones, and bronze lichens which powdered them like gold dust. Madge was believed to have a craze about the cathedral ; she painted it constantly, from every point of view, with something like an agony of admiration, and something like an agony of abase ment at her own inadequate attempts to do it justice. She often told herself she was a vain fool to approach it with a pencil ; it was as far above her as the sky, and she ought to confine herself to cottages ; but, after all, it was an unfailing source of joy to her. I believe its very stones were dear to her, like the dust of Zion to the captives in Babylon ; above all, it served her as a master in an apprenticeship. All of us had better begin, as we will have to end by casting amateur achievements to the winds, and submitting to a long, irksome, toilsome, though gradually brightening apprentice ship. Madge had been painting during the day, hot as it had been, and was now, perforce, resting and thinking in the twilight ; and then, to reward Madge, there suddenly dawned upon her, and marched before her, one of those processions of"], [169, "Ambition. 157 the future, which beguile us from the present and lure us on to glory or to destruction. But first, before catching the bright film of Madge's dream, a word on the sober substance of Madge's life. Madge's home was a quiet one, to some too quiet ; but Madge liked it, loved it with a sacred intensity of fondness, somewhat as she did the old cathe dral. Her father was a respectable old tradesman, not rich, though with a strain of refinement in his disposition which many monied men want. They used to call him, with justice, a gentlemanly old man. Madge's mother was more bustling and more ordinary ; still she was a kindly woman, loved and slaved for Madge and the little ones, and was only vexed that Madge's life was half-moping, half- laborious like her own. Mrs. Haliburton would have been quite contented going on doing a drudge's work for Madge, if Madge would but have been what she could thoroughly understand ; if Madge would have taken her pleasure and made a little show in the town, and only occasionally helped her mother and the servant-girl with the cooking, and cleaning, and mending, and making of garments for the family. It was short-sighted of Mrs. Hali burton, but it was so far disinterested ; and per haps there was blended with it a little vexed pre science. If Madge went on with her reading and drawing, though she made her living by them, would not such pursuits gradually separate her from her mother ? Would not Madge, good and"], [170, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 158 true as she might be, prove less her mother's com panion and friend if she should be able to work a miracle, and grow into a cultivated genius ? Mrs. Haliburton was right ; Madge did drift away from her mother's side to occupy another position with regard to her ; and it caused them both pain and trouble for many a day ere they fitted into their new places. Madge's brothers and sisters were all younger than she was, and, as it sometimes happens in large families, were more companions of each other than of Madge ; and yet there was no want of affection between them. So it happened that when Madge kept a vigil she kept it alone. And Madge knew very well that to be an artist of even moderate pretensions, she must eat her bread emphatically in the sweat of her brow, or else throw an additional load on her already burdened father. It was this reflection more than any other that occasionally staggered Madge ; but I do not find that it ever diverted the girl to any extent from her course, any more than the hoary, serene, unattainable perfection of the old cathedral ; and thus we come upon Madge resting from painting. Madge sat on an old window-seat in a kind of lumber-room, where she was at liberty to draw and paint, and where she could command leisure ; and well it is for your isolated student if there is such a lumber-room in a family house. She was idly fingering some shells, and looking out on the"], [171, "Ambition. 159 cathedral, already looming a giant in the gloam ing, and away on the yellow stretch of sands and the grey sea. The sea and the sands are not favourable to ambition, any more than fragrant hay-fields and cattle-sheds. The Bucolics are apt to cripple a man and render him bovine ; the sea and the sands are too vast, they press upon one like a fate ; they suggest, not a note of victory, but a moaning for the doomed and their destiny. But Madge was too young to study nature with a human instead of an artist's eye. To look at Madge herself, she was nothing remarkable : she was tall and fresh-coloured, a little old-looking for her years, and with something restless in her air, and searching in her eyes, which spoiled their beauty ; her hands, too, showed her a nervous girl, as they perpetually opened and closed on the round shell, with its flecks of rich, soft, shaded tints, like those painted on the skin of a wild beast. Madge was fancying, \" What if I ever gain expression and skill to paint the cathedral as truly as the sea, or the living creature within, from the essence of its own being, has painted this shell, and folk start and draw a long breath, and stand to gaze at the sac-simile as they do at the original, and feel that it too is a reality, has the impress of spirit. I think I have something in common with the cathedral, or with the man who built it, although it is not very modest to say it even to myself; but I do feel one with it, as I do not feel with many speakers and their speeches."], [172, "160 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. Little Davie suggested the other day, apropos of the engine roaring and tearing along on the other side ofthe garden-wall, ' I wonder if that big brute knows me ; ' very egotistical of Davie, and I am sure it is very egotistical of me to suppose that I know the cathedral, and that it looks down on me like a grand old father. Some day if I try every shade and every hue, and paint and pant and pray, will it come nearer me, and shall I read all its pro portions and dyes, and hold converse with the spirit which devised it, as a man with his fellow ? How calm, and full, and conscious of wisdom and power I should be then, and how bountiful to humanity to multiply beauty, and bring it round our boards and beds ! Oh, dear, how crazed the town would think me, if it could hear me thinking. The people call me cracked already, and they scorn my poor father and mother for tolerating my pride and vanity, and they say my pride will have a fall, and that it is madness to encourage a girl to be unlike her neighbours ; nothing good ever comes of it. Even Mr. Bernard, the artist, hinted to my father that it was folly and presumption in me to choose such a walk, though I had some taste and touch ; women Were never anything better in his trade than weak bunglers.

Madge is in the dear old house, but she is no loneer in the lumber-room, which never looked dreary in these cloudless summer mornings and evenings. She is in a modern painting-room, with all the"], [175, "Ambition. 163 accessories and indulgences of modern invention ; palette and easel, lay-figure, models and casts dis posed around her. Madge is not a girl now ; she is a woman past her prime. Her air has lost its restlessness, but it is languid with the reflection of weariness ; her eyes are no longer searching, but they are hollow in her face. It is somewhere about Christmas time, and Madge owns that it ought to be holiday with her, and so does not work, but comes and sits and meditates in . the dusk, before her studio fire, as she pondered in the summer sunset over the sea by the western window. There is a shadow upon Madge to-night; a black, thick shadow, which strongly sympathetic natures must face and overcome. Madge rather crouches and cowers over her fire, and listens to the voices in the next room. The old people are there, and some of their family, and Madge has a sense to-night that her presence may be an intru sion among them. Respected and beloved, she is still a check on their frank, ordinary life. It is a sad truth, that Madge is more isolated as a woman than as a girl. Had her family been some steps higher on the social ladder ; had Madge not had to toil so heavily and unremittingly, she might have carried them in a greater degree with her. As it is, she may be their divinity, but she is not their familiar friend. But Madge has done something that should con-"], [176, "164 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. sole her. Her cathedral is not only stamped upon her soul, but she has given forth reflections of it, and of other cathedrals, and of cathedrals of the rocks and the woods, which she has lived to re cognise. Not kindred eyes alone, \u2014 common eyes have read them, and responded with a dumb joy to the reading. Madge has conquered. They no longer say, in her native town, that she is silly and audacious, and the next thing to an adventuress ; for in Madge's town unacknowledged intellect is barely respectable. They no longer sneer at the patent defects which Mr. Bernard has kindly and magnanimously pointed out to them in her works, and pity the poor thing for infatuatedly spending her strength for nought, and giving her money for that which is not bread ; and next pity the idiotic father and mother for lending her their countenance in her enthusiasm, and for not positively forbidding the nuisance. Ah ! poor Mrs. Haliburton had done her best with the conceited, headstrong girl ; and it was well known that she was mortified and affronted by Madge's pretensions to studiousness and affec tation of genius. She had been well aware, that making puddings and stitching shirts would have better become her daughter. For Mr. Halibur ton, it was well known that he was always a poor scheming creature himself, so that the girl had, doubtless, her absurdity by descent. That was over. The inhabitants no longer laughed"], [177, "Ambition. 165 and shook their heads, as Madge passed them on the street with her portfolio. They bowed to her, and called for her ; the magnates did, and asked her co-operation in their societies, and listened to her advice when she bestowed it along with her contributions. Madge had done something more at home : the old tradesman's household was no longer hampered and harassed ; the wheels of life ran easily there now ; the spirits that had been subdued and distracted, at length tasted self-respect, cheerfulness. The younger members ofthe family were going out into the world with less clouded anticipations and sunnier prospects. And Madge had done something too for her own spiritual deve lopment ; had won some commission worth chroni cling. One or two knights-errant, waging war with ignorance, ugliness, sloth, and sin, had clasped hands with her in her career, warmed her poor, stiff fingers with their encouragement and approval, lifted up her struggling spirit to something of a level with their own freedom, and given her a draught or two of the pure air, and a glimpse or two ofthe heaven that would be. But Madge sees nothing of this to-night ; her mantle of darkness is upon her. Her pictures \u2014 they are miserable caricatures, faded shadows decrying, degrading the glorious works of God, the majestic efforts of masters and true craftsmen. She sees every false line and weak point in them to-night, until she puts her hands before her eyes to"], [178, "166 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. shut out the copies on the walls ; copies which she had painted with childlike hope, love, and thankfulness. She had deceived others, or else their money was rife ; and some who gave praise and not money had been weakly good-natured, or basely hypocritical, and had only feigned to be de ceived. And for this gross failure she has pawned youth, leisure, equal companionship, kindly ties. She remembers when she had gone out almost at day-break, morning after morning, walked miles and miles, through dust or mire, to this waterfall or that bridge, painted and painted the live-long day, ate a morsel of bread from her pocket, and lagged home at night-fall faint and weary. She remembers when she had missed both dinner and supper to run at odd moments to the cathedral ; when she had missed her father's prayers, to take it under the light of the first star ; when she had to pay a special fee to the old man at the gate, be stared at as uncanny, and grumbled over as un reasonable. She had narrowly escaped being crippled with rheumatism ; she had been once or twice on the verge of a nervous fever ; and what were her wages ? The old folk were more com fortable, \u2014 she confessed that ; but would she not have been more of a comfort to them, more a daily and nightly right-hand man, a house-daughter in short, such as fathers and mothers love best and prefer first, \u2014 had she not endowed them as a bene factress, but relieved them as a child ? Had she"], [179, "Ambition. 167 simply been interested in their concerns and oc cupied at their instigation ? She fancied Janet and Melville might be careless of their every wish. She knew she could have been devoted to them, but she had no liberty left her. Her father grudged to see her hem his pocket-handkerchiefs ; her mother refused to allow her to make her markets. \" We won't take up your valuable time, Madge. No, no, my dear, go to your canvas, or else enjoy yourself in your own way.\" That was not the worst of it. Continual hurry of mind is not conducive to tranquillity of temper. Madge writhed under the fear that she was often impatient and undutiful in word, though never in deed. Madge was all for obscurity and mediocrity to-night. Simple suffering was the best discipline to a woman ; acting as she had done was a for ward, fatal error. For Madge's brothers and sisters, alas, alas ' some were no longer here for whom Madge had striven and conquered. She had her guerdon, but she could only place it on their silent graves. And were not they who were gone, the very ones for whom Madge could have worked most wonders, who would have rejoiced most in her attainments, who could have profited most by her gain ? The others seemed to be independent of her, \u2014 might be rendered worse instead of better, by a staff to lean upon, a shelter to fall back into. There was Melville, so blooming and thoughtless, engaged to"], [180, "168 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. be married, too, though she had never borne a cross, or taken to herself a care. How would she stand alone, or combat with difficulties in the battle of life ? Love would teach her, and love was a tenderer teacher than the grim old cathedral ; love would find her and leave her fearless, fond, depen dent, and trustful. Melville was not alone this cold December night ; Melville would not be alone under the laurel crown on her grey hairs ; Mel ville would not lie alone on her dying bed. There was a tap at the door of Madge's room, followed by a rustling, and whispering, and joyful giggling of young and old voices. It grated on Madge's ears. \" Come in,\" she said austerely, and looked round with asperity. But the indignation vanished from Madge's brow in a moment, when there entered her old father with his hand on his stick, her mother, in the very lace cap under whose peaked caul Madge used to imagine there was safety and assurance for ever, her sisters, her brother Hugh and his wife, and one or two of their little, stumping, brawling children, in the particular escort and patronage of her youngest brother Davie. \" We thought you were too long alone, child, and none of these refractory young people would take upon them to interrupt you and fetch you, so we have come in a body, for we cannot do without you, Madge,\" and then there burst in a chorus :"], [181, "Ambition. 169 \" To choose the colours ofthe wools, Madge.\" \" To help to entertain us, who are strangers.\" \" To cut out figures for us, Aunt Madge, and make trumpets and boats.\" \" To awe impertinent people, Madge.\" Madge rose, yawning and laughing, as if she had been caught in a stupid, luxurious nap, but with a pang of remorse and repentance at her tender heart. In the parlour, the servant was putting down her letters, and waiting to speak to her. \" The cripple, Andrew, Miss Madge, come to let you see how he is getting on with his schooling, and he's as proud as a peacock before he begins ; and the old woman, Macfarlane, come to tell of her daughter's recovery in the hospital, and she's as happy as a queen this night.\" Madge, Madge, read your letters, for I predict they contain commissions and criticisms which make you blush, for you are as bashful, Madge, as Lord Nelson, about whom Davie mutters in his sleep. Madge turned her back. \" O Lord, forgive me. My lines are cast in pleasant places. My cup is running over.\""], [182, "170 CHAPTER VI. PLEASURE. I suppose no one denies that we all desire pleasure, notwithstanding our difficulty in attain ing it. However, there is this curious contra diction, that there is nothing more necessary than to urge young girls to cultivate purely pleasant habits, purely pleasant tastes which shall not pall, which they may reasonably hope will increase and brighten with years, and be made perfect in a better and an enduring world. There is nothing more puzzling, and yet more patent in the pre sent day, than the neglect and destruction, as far as it is possible, of a multitude of delicate instincts which, quite as much as great faculties, fill us with pleasure. The eye is untrained, or only artificially trained ; the natural ear is neglected in the midst of its elaborate tutoring, or only accustomed to dis cord ; the quick feelings are allowed to run riot, or condemned to be blunted ; the bright humour to sleep ; the buoyant elasticity to sink flat and dead."], [183, "Pleasure. 171 How full our life is ; how much we might enjoy it, and thank God for it ! But we overlook our treasures, and forsake them for the cold glitter of fairy gold, or the dead heaviness of substantial but unlacked, unsuitable bullion, till we find our error too late. And well it is if it only end in a long, wistful sigh of regret ; if, in spite of all our follies and imputations, we have still built on the rock of our Master and our duty. One of the very first lessons to be learned is, that true pleasure is a simple, lowly, homely, hearty thing, open, in a great degree, to most of us. Alas, alas ! that ever there should be such hard circumstances as to crush it out of existence. But to many, to multitudes, to the mass of those addressed, pleasure is an easy thing ; is nigh you, is ready to burst out into blossom over your head, and under your feet. Only condescend to lift up your eyes and look for it, and stoop and pluck it ; for, like everything else worth having, it is coy, and will not force itself on your reluctant or care less grasp. It is scarcely necessary to say to a good girl that true pleasure cannot consist in what belongs to mere rivalry and gratified vanity. Such pleasure is, to treat it most gently, very empty and unsatis factory ; and unless it is mixed with some genuine emotion, some honest assertion of honest claims, honest satisfaction in honest gifts, honest gratifica tion in the honest pride of friends, it is about as"], [184, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 172 noisy, hollow, and short-lived as that crackling of thorns beneath the pot, which the wise man banned. But it is incumbent to publish that pleasure, like duty, does not consist in anything like intel lect and great mental attainment. To some, of course, it lies there, as even to the soldier it may lurk in the smoke of artillery, and the flash of steel ; and to another soldier of the same master, it may actually abide in the dark and noisome den in which he blesses God that he hails the dawn of a better day. But to all it is plainly in what affords them innocent gratification. It is a giant with a hundred hands ; a rainbow with a thousand dyes. It changes, Proteus-fashion ; it varies with a mil lion temperaments. It may be something very different to you from what it is to me. But it perfectly agrees in this respect, \u2014 it is a harmless, nay, a softening, sweetening enjoyment, though we may not and need not go far out of our way to seek it, and must not sacrifice for it our cross of duty. We are bound to cherish it as one of the instal ments of the future, one of the alleviations of the present, a bright drop of dew, a brave beam of sunshine sent to refresh and gladden us by our gracious Father. And the more childlike our hearts are, the more submissive and loving, the more readily we admit, the more freely we enter tain the heavenly visitant. We cannot be true Protestants, we must be clinging very pertinaci-"], [185, "Pleasure. 173 ously to the doctrines and practices of will-worship, asceticism, supererogatory mortification, if we do not recognise the obligation and privilege of draw ing forth all the pleasures within our nature and locality, and carrying them heavenwards. But if pleasures are countless as the leaves on the tree, and, like the leaves, not two alike, they fall also pretty generally into classes, and offer themselves in their divisions to particular orders of the community. To young girls, allowing for many exceptions, there exists a peculiar range of delights, capable of expanding and maturing with the growth of the woman, until, in full-dropping ripeness, balmy and mellow, they salute the last, lingering, earthly sensations of widowed wives, aged mothers, withered spinsters hovering on the border-land. This range belongs largely to primi tive nature, to flower-gardens, kitchen-gardens, fields, woods, moors, mountains ; to animals, wild and domestic, useful and ornamental, cows and poultry, birds and bees, dogs and cats. That a perception of the fascination of such magnets is latent in the great body of men and women, is clear from its appearance under the most unfavour able circumstances, and after the longest intervals. The stunted rose in the cracked tea-pot is not more hackneyed evidence than the fact, that agri cultural and horticultural tastes show themselves promptly, and engross a large proportion of the time, talents, ambition, and amusement, of the"], [186, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 174 opulent, disengaged decline of life. The success ful merchant withdraws to his villa, and dedicates his hard-won leisure to mangel-wurzel and pine apples, while his wife expatiates and luxuriates among her Alderneys and Cochin-Chinas. Of the retired tradesmen and their partners, whose ease and cash do not drag upon them, ninety-nine out of the hundred are amateur farmers or gardeners, or holders of some description of live stock. That so many only take to the teeming world \u2014 animate and inanimate around them \u2014 late in life, demon strates that the original bent was choked and over laid, and wanted excavation. Those who soonest disentangle it into breezy air and hardy life, develop also the most wholesome bodies and souls, the sweetest and sunniest tempers. Questionless, there are instances of crabbed gardeners, and gruff farmers, but what would those rugged specimens of humanity have been without the lilies and the wheat ? And are not their roughnesses but outer excrescences ? See them with the favourite child on the knee, the chosen friend at the elbow : why, they are tender philanthropists and kindly humorists in disguise. Now, with regard to this wide arena of health and happiness, in the green fields and the singing birds, it is a mistake to consider the girls of the present day before their great-grandmothers. It is not only that heedless youth, in its own head strong, self-engrossed fashion, rushes along and"], [187, "Pleasure. 175 misses the very sedative of which it stands in need. But the habits of our present generation, the very accomplishments, the excessive pushing and strain ing after social importance, are all against simple, natural tastes. You will find the mother watching the young lambs coming into the fold with the careful ewes, and the daughter off in a fit of the gapes ; the aunt, contrasting the crimson-tipped oak leaves with the blue-green of the juniper, and the olive-green of the wild rasp ; and the niece, in fretful horror lest the sprays from the bushes tear her cumbrous crinoline. You will even discover the tottering, old grandmother pulling up the gay celandine, or the feathery meadow-sweet from the waterside ; while the granddaughter has bor rowed her brother's rod, and is fishing the pool, for \" a lark,\" as she says, in her brother's slang, but in reality, to attract the attention of all the half scornful, half-scared fishers up and down the stream. It is not that the present race of young people are more frivolous than the last, but they are more removed from unconscious, close, constant study of nature. Yes, they are, in spite of science and art, perhaps, in some instances, because of super ficial, undigested science and art ; in spite of far greater accommodation \u2014 immensely increased faci lities of travelling, greenhouses made easy, aviaries, aquariums \u2014 they are very generally more removed from our old homely, humble, blessed mother-"], [188, "176 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. earth, and her subordinate creatures. This is the case just as much reading is apt to end in little thinking, as popular lectures have often resulted in popular ignorance, self-satisfied, defiant, all but incurable, for the reason that it wore a shallow disguise of knowledge. All the appliances of modern training include a danger of leaving our girls vain, arrogant, preten tious, and insincere. They have studied botany, but they don't care for their specimens one hun dredth part that their mother cared for her hydran gea in the green-and-white striped stoneware pot, which was such a cold, hard substitute for the soft stained, oozy brick. They don't mind their ferns and mosses as she prized the upper slice of carrot, which she cut and floated on a wine glass full of water, and saw rear its shafts of feathers when the snow was lying thick in the valley ; or the cress-seed which she sowed on the moistened flannel over the cup, to astound and delight poor sick little Hughie. Ah ! you girls want the easy admiration, the frank, loving wiles of your mothers ! Our great-grandmothers, in the dearth of many other resources, thought much more of the frag rance of the mint and thyme in their herb-gardens, the sweetness of the fruit of their cherry-trees, the gaiety of their larks' songs, the stature of their calves, the fatness of their chickens, the familiarity of their pet-lambs, even the smartness of their parrots, and tame starlings and sparrows, than many of their"], [189, "Pleasure. 177 descendants dream of doing of any plant or animal at home or abroad. The sciences are noble in their own way ; open air sketching is a valuable power; pic-nics are occasionally pleasant, social re-unions, but Char lotte Bronte has told how little the agreeableness of a pic-nic has to do with burying one's face and heart in green leaves. We have all known pic nic visits to ruins which were never looked at, to views which were never seen, to waterfalls which were missed. Pic-nics, in the old days, were named whims or follies. My lady's whim, or my lady's folly, to eat a syllabub or a bun under a tree, or on clover. As far as regards learning to know God's world, pic-nics (unless strictly family gather ings) will be whims and follies to the young always. No ; take nature quietly ; make a secret con tract with her, or, at most, a threefold friendship between you two and a home- brother or sister. Don't mix her up too much with books.

You may visit a botanical or zoological garden occasionally with pleasure and profit, but you will never cull from the foreign plants and beasts and birds, not even from the Victoria Regina and the hippopotami, a tithe ofthe benefit to be won, with little trouble, from your beds of anemones and sweet-william ; or your canaries, with their quilted flannel nest in the corner of their family cage ; or your brood of young turkeys, spotted brown, black, and creamy-white, like Paul Potter's cattle, and hectored and protected by the bullying turkey cock ; or your downy yellow ducklings, so soon waddling to the willow-fringed pond ; or the litter of puppies which your brother Harry is so glad that the covetousness of his friends enables him to per mit Juno, poor lass ! to please her soft heart by bringing up, though they are only to weary and harass her. Get acquainted with every leaf in your garden, every stone in the mossy wall. You have great precedents. A French philosopher made a walk round his garden fill two wonderful volumes. An English painter caused a brick wall to occupy his canvas for three entire months. But do you only regard them in a humble, human spirit. Have pets ; as your great-grandaunts and great grandmothers owned them in store. They may be profitable pets, as cows, goats, hens, pigeons ; or unprofitable, as love-birds, Java sparrows, Italian greyhounds, Russian cats.

Don't fear the waste of food \u2014 unless, indeed, you are conscious of starving some human being. What ! would you presume to stint the lavish stores ofthe great Creator ? Remember, He created all these creatures you are so ready to call useless ; and if human beings were condemned by that same criterion of apparent uselessness, woe is me ! how many of us would be left ? No massacre in history would be equal to that great immolation of women and children, and men thrown in to the bargain. Don't listen to that bitter or foolish say ing, that they will only die one day and grieve you. According to that selfish, morbid argument, you would not love your brother whom you have seen, for, alas, alas ! he will die one day, and your heart will be wrung, though the parting be but for a sea son.

Harriet Martineau has a sensible, lively hint to girls in the country on the impossibility of their wanting objects of interest and amusement, if they"], [192, "180 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. are only intelligent and active. Happily much of the ridiculous affectation of being ignorant of com mon rural objects is on the wane in the broad light of our day ; and we are more likely to meet with an extreme, exaggerated enthusiasm for colts and heifers, donkeys and goslings, than to be troubled with a high-flown scorn of their very existence. All that is untrue is bad, but, at least, we may re ceive the assumption of superior knowledge as the evidence of a more ample and genial standard of worth and beauty. One word, in addition, to those young persons who may be disheartened by having grown up with only a vague general sense of enjoyment in the world of nature ; a pleasant notion of blue skies and green fields, and pretty weeds in the hedges, with no intimate acquaintance or close communion with any of them. Do not be discouraged. This is a taste which it is possible to begin to cultivate sedu lously and successfully at any period of life, even to old age. The writer speaks from experience. Brought up in a treeless district ofthe country, the commonest distinctions between the crisp, shining leaves of the beech and the leaves of the elm, \" rough as a cow's tongue,\" were long unknown to her by sight.

Buried alive, indeed ; I never felt less buried in my life. I have come to my kingdom, and my king is King Charlie, \u2014 dear, old, stout, crusty, un comprehended brother Charlie, \u2014 and we've been parted for three-quarters of our lives. We've had other views and relinquished them, and other friends not so faithful and lost them. We've come together again to keep house for the rest of our days in the wilds, where Charlie is agent and factotum on my Lord's moors and newly brought-in land. And they think me \" buried alive ! \" Our house stands so directly south-east by east, that we catch the first rays of the sun ; and I have so much to do, that, dear heart ! I can not tell where to begin, and can no more weary than I can knit a coverlet. I am aware I have sustained a dreadful loss in morning-calls and even ing-parties ; but I trust I'll survive that, and the rest is great gain. I have been buried alive in a large town, among a crowd of acquaintances, when I was young and silly, and went with the multi tude, and continually took things to heart, and had my feelings wounded ; but now I'm going to do my duty, and keep old Charlie right and tight, and make a garden pay its own rent, after the example of the garden in the book that is in the windows of all the booksellers' shops, and on all the railway stalls ; I'm going to get well acquainted with nature be fore I'm too old to study her fresh face, and get acquainted, too, with humanity ; not fine-lady"], [195, "Pleasure. 183 humanity, or fine-girl humanity, or fancy-cottage humanity, in particular, but humanity wholesale, great and small, odds and ends ; humanity among big matrons and little maids, and people who have dirty faces, and keep unvarnished pigs.

I arrived yesterday ; Charlie was waiting for me at the coach ; for we 're so far beyond the habitable world, that we travel here by means of a coach. Poor, dear Charlie isn't communicative, but I always thought him suggestive ; and the way he looked at the ears of the pony in his curricle, and then at the tail of his whip, told me he had some thing on his mind. \" You mayn't like the place, Katie,\" he sug gested. \" Mayn't I, Charlie ? No fears of that.\" And then he stared into my face, and laughed a short laugh of confidence. \" No society, Katie.\" I never heard of a place without society, Charlie, except in the backwoods, and then, I suppose, at the worst there are Indian wigwams, where the natives will either tomahawk you, or barter their mocassins for your calico.\" \" Terrible rough set these old settlers on the moor, Katie ; believe they're of gipsy blood.\""], [196, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 184 \" More credit in bringing them in, Charlie, if we can bring them in.

We'll do, Katie.\" I was as proud as a princess. We drove then along a bad road, with broken, straggling hedge-rows, but with a grand fir-wood on our right hand, until Charlie broke out again \u2014 \" Unpropitious name, Katie.\" \" What is it, Charlie ? You never told me, and I had to address my boxes where I addressed my letters, to Mr. Charles Durham's, at my lord's. If you had not come to meet me, I must have gone and raised a hue and cry after you at the Castle ; they would have judged me a forsaken young woman in a breach of promise of marriage case, and you a heartless deceiver, and hardened villain.\" Charlie laughed his husky laugh. \" We don't look like it ; not a bit romantic.\" \"Speak for yourself, Charlie; you're a heavy, prosy old man.\""], [197, "Pleasure. 185 \"And you're fat, fair, and forty; but it's not romantic \u2014 the name, I mean.\" \" What is it ? make a clean breast ot it ; do, Mud Hole?\" \" No ; but it's Windy Walls.\" \" Oh, it's Windy Walls, is it ? then we'll have plenty of the fresh air about which the public is raving.\" r> Charlie laughed once more, and pointed with his whip-hand. \" There it is, Katie. It doesn't look sheltered, though it is a famous place for plovers' eggs.\" It was an old farm-house on the edge of the new-found-land, planted on the ridge of a water shed, I believe without a growing tree within half a mile. I'm thankful it is too much wood, and not too little, which hurts the health, and Charlie and I are stout enough to keep out the cold from our bones, and we will maintain roaring fires, since we have the old tree-roots for nothing. These ex posed stations are remarkable, too, for the growth of hardy flowers, China roses, carnations, and all common annuals. They do like the air. Give them plenty of sun and pure air, and they will not find fault with a stiff breeze, but blossom with their necks twisted right round the wrong way. I told Charlie so, while I caught at my bonnet-strings. What a gush of clean, cold gale ! it gave me an ap petite for a month ; and what a deal I had to effect. Wouldn't I have the making of my home ? A"], [198, "186 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. ready-made, elegant home ! Pshaw ! a tame, paltry affair. Wasn't my ingenuity given me for some purpose, and shan't I deserve some credit of my kind, when Windy Walls is bright without and snug within, and enviable everywhere ? Somebody or other wrote that if a woman could do nothing else, she could at least buy or rent a bit of ground, dig and sow it, rear and gather in her crops, and feel that she had not lived in vain. That writer deserved being listened to. Go, ye idle, giddy girls ; ye vacant or tattling women ; dig, and reap, and be wise. Now, I have not only to bring in a garden at Windy Walls, where Charlie has been living like a savage of a man, but to constitute a weather-stained, mouldy, half-empty, old house a commodious, agreeable dwelling, and I will do it, or die. The shorter my purse, the longer my renown. To-day, I rose and meditated on a shred-carpet, of scarlet shreds, a military achievement manufac tured out of two old cavalry cloaks and yeomen's jackets of my grandfather's. I expatiated on the plan to Martha, who, I am sorry to say, was dull in taking it in, and threw cold water on its splen dour, as if that had not been sufficiently done by the dulling, damaging friction of the backs of men and horses on the original garments. \" Coats is coats,\" was all that Martha would say. \" No, Martha, coats is not coats under clever"], [199, "Pleasure. 187 hands, and no genius worth speaking of ever ex isted who could not make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\" Martha shook her head ; she made up her mind that Mr. Durham was a sensible, 'sponsible man, but Miss Durham was light in the head for her size and years. I was more successful with the weaver, to whom I walked across after breakfast. He understood the thing in a moment, and under took it for me, even conceiving an interest in the subject, regarding it from beneath his white eye brows, and over his spectacles, while his toothless, canty wife became my loquacious friend on the spot, because I freely bestowed on her the overplus of material for a winter-rug. I wonder why tooth lessness and cantiness go so often together. Are our teeth our natural enemies, and do we rejoice when we have got well rid of them ? or are we of a saturnine turn, and grin to show the world how we despise our own empty jaws ? I came home and contemplated the grounds. I may as well call them by a sounding name, since names are cheap. There may be convolvuluses and nasturtiums clinging to us next summer ; but, at the present moment, there are only purple thistles, and goat's beard, and great flaunting yellow ragwort, and blue buglos, and little eye -bright, and thyme.

Charlie is too wheezy to read out Shakspere now, but he's not too deaf to listen yet. At the same time, I'm not going to torture him into being a student. I 've had enough of that. I once drove poor Charlie into something like mischief \u2014 blind bat that I was \u2014 by my con temptible pedantry, and I owe him such amends \u2014 oh, such amends ! To be sure he was always a great deal cleverer, as he is a great deal older than I; but he never was bookish. He's intensely social in a quiet way. I could bet a pair of gloves he's soon the best player of cricket in the round, though he is so many stones' weight ; and he could challenge the curate, or the doctor, or the school master at draughts and backgammon. I filled two saucers with the thyme, that we might sniff at it, and yet not grow vulgar. Garden thyme and oil of thyme are odious, you know ; odious in Betty the cook. Even lemon thyme, which I must have for my bees, is a debatable dainty ; but wild thyme ! Wild thyme was the couch of Titania ; it is fit for ears polite ; it is quite a refined, intellectual, fanciful good. Hamlet and the grave - digger were right. We do make singular distinctions. In my examination, I spied such a capability, such a delightful, charming, endlessly varied capa bility ; a treasure a thousand times more precious than Miss Kilmansegge's \" bright, beautiful golden leg.\" We have two windows in our parlour; one"], [201, "Pleasure. 189 to the front, where roses are to blow; the other to the gable, looking into the farm-yard, into which the cattle-sheds and cow-house and stable open. Only think of that ! the busy, thronged, everchang ing farm-yard. Charlie is such an orderly old man, that he'll keep it sweet and wholesome ; and we'll have near us \" the breath of kine\" which Pallas loved, which cured the poor, consumptive girl sent to breathe it from the chambers of nobles. We'll have watch-dog, cocks and hens, ducks and geese, lambs, horses, cows, all our familiar friends. The peacocks and whole flocks of doves will come and eat the crumbs off the window-sill, as they do on the door-steps at the Castle. Darby and Joan will court before our eyes. The farm-yard will be our stage, with the scenes ever shifting ; the farm-yard will be our concert-room, our tea and scandal, our supper and rubber. We'll never weary. We might have been \"buried alive\" in winter, when our flowers were all brown and bare ; but with our look-out among our subjects of the brute creation \u2014 our faithful, fond, noble, beautiful sub jects \u2014 I'll defy us to weary. The ancients were right with their gable -windows into their farm yards. Every farm-house should have a gable window, and every gable window should look out on a pale, yellow straw-yard, well tenanted, lying at its feet.

Winter ! what must I not do before winter ? I must not trust to Martha ; I must learn to powder butter, cure hams, hang beef, and dry herbs out of my neighbours' gardens. The farmers' wives will laugh at me, but I will laugh back ; laugh and learn, as well as laugh and grow fat. I flatter myself I can bake cakes already, as I think the farmer's rosy girl will bear me witness. She sang me such a bouncing, frisky song. I must have her to sing it to Charlie; he'll drum on the table with his knuckles, though he has not a notion of tune ; and that causes his regard for music \u2014 his blundering, ignorant, instinctive regard \u2014 to be something touching to my mind.

In one of Miss Edgeworth's tales (I think The Absentee), there is an instance of a lady deciding her selection from her suitors, by the happy man's being able to prove that he possessed a faithful friend ; and the test was by no means without its merits. In a former paper I alluded to the fact that long before Miss Edgeworth's day, novels, biography, and essays laid much stress on evidences of friendship as indications of excellence. A heroine, like Harriet Byron, had a host of friends, and although she may tempt us to think of \" the hare and many friends,\" and we may feel that she must have been in some sort a victim to her popu larity, still it would do no harm to a heroine ofthe present day, if she would ask herself whether she could call forward a grandmamma to bless her darling ; an Uncle and Aunt Sedley to approve cor dially of each stage of her career ; or even a set of 10!"], [204, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 192 cousins to sing her praises, after the faintest copy of the kindred of the incomparable Harriet ; and if not, what is the reason of the failure ? But, grant ing that the man or woman with a multitude of friends is a paragon, a ph\u0153nix, and has his or her own peculiar danger from the chivalry and devotion of the individual's court, the man or woman with out a friend is surely singularly unfortunate, or singularly reprehensible. It has been said that women are incapable of true friendship; but, like many other glib speeches, this is an assertion not only without foundation, but made in the face of a mass of proof to the con trary. There may be a difficulty, from the nature of the relation between man and woman, of a calm, clear, steady, unexacting friendship between them, though such friendships have existed by thousands ; but friendships between woman and woman, with which we deal here, have flourished by tens of thousands. Those who believe the contrary, are no better than Turks in their opinion of women. Possibly, one reason for the charge of women being incapable of friendship, results from the cause that their friendships are more domestic, hidden, and retiring than those of men. Of course, we do not speak of the bathos of school-girl ecstasies, but of the strong, satisfying regard between modest, earnest, often-tried women. Men go out into the world, and frequently form their friendships far beyond the family circle, and quite independent of"], [205, "Friendship. 193 the ties of blood. Of the best women, it may be said that their friendships are those of their own households ; with them, friendship but adds its evergreen crown to a blood relationship. Sisters and cousins \u2014 at the farthest, old school-fellows and neighbours \u2014 are generally the Davids and Jonathans, the Damons and Pythiases. But within these limits, examples of as enduring, long-suffering, tender, noble friendship as ever knit together hearts, offer their manifold records. Madame de Sevigne and her daughter (and even witty Lady Mary had a solid kindness for her Marchioness of Bute), Fanny Burney and her sister Susanna, Anne Grant of Laggan and her former youthful com panions, the Ewings and Harriet Reid, have left vivid, indelible traces on black and white of the great volume of their affection, and its faithful flow to death. Suffer young girls to make friends, and keep them as their best human stay. They need not fear that they will prove false, if their own love be with out dissimulation. They need not fear, if they can cleave to their chosen companions in their adver sity, and not love them one whit better because of their prosperity ; if they will choose them like that hackneyed wedding-gown of Mrs. Primrose, be cause of qualities which will wear well. They need not fear, if they themselves will try to be humble, reasonable, and forbearing, will resolve not to ex pect too much of their friends, will not be very angry N"], [206, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 194 with them because of errors, will not refuse to for give them even when they commit faults, will al ways strive to bear in mind that \" the true friend is a brother,\" and that the end of true friendship is to go on hand in hand, \u2014 each raising the other, each supporting the other, \u2014 ever upwards and onwards to the brightness and the peace of the better home in the many mansions of the Father's house. Honest friends, fond friends, constant friends they must be, my girls ; and after that proviso, care little whether they are fashionable friends, or distinguished in any way ; even be willing to lend them a portion of your own superior wisdom and goodness, if they are deficient, but well-disposed and sincere in their esteem for you. Much pro gress in worth has been accomplished under the shelter and countenance of a friend ; here, \" freely you have received, freely give.\" Be willing, in a secondary sense, to \" spend and be spent \" for your friends ; don't meanly grudge your love and pains, and cautiously weigh every grain of their return. Bestow thorough respect and sympathy ; lively, considerate, affectionate attention in health ; de voted care and self-abnegation in sickness ; and without doubt or denial, be you wedded wife or solitary spinster, you will not fail in any circum stance to have and hold a tender and true friend. In the world there are two opposite corruptions of friendship, which are glaringly conspicuous. The one is the selection of high friends, who may"], [207, "Friendship. 195 pull us up not in morals, but in power, or place, or fashion ; the other the taste for low company, which \u2014 no, we certainly do not mean that it should drag us down \u2014 but where we may reign queen, be flattered instead of flattering, command rather than obey, indulge in all our ugly habits without censure. But human nature is the same ; these two abuses of friendship have their origin in the same source \u2014 vanity and pride ; and sometimes the poles meet curiously in one person. As human nature is the same, young girls will, at least, coast these shoals ; but I need not say surely to good girls, to avoid them as contamination ; don't let them, if they can help it, pollute the name of friend ship, if they would not lose their reverence for all that deserves reverence. My own opinion is, that a perfectly developed friendship can scarcely exist, or at least attain its full, free expression between those of widely dif ferent ages and stations, in spite of Wordsworth's lad, and his \"Matthew seventy-two.\" It may be a very beautiful, beneficial, independent looking up and bending down, and in that light it ought to greet us continually ; but it is another connexion altogether from close friendship. However, in the cases of real grand friends, or humble friends, the young girl requires discretion and forethought, both for herself and another ; and she is hardly likely, altogether, to escape at once experiencing and inflict ing pain, of which there is no chance among her"], [208, "196 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. equals. Her grand friend will unavoidably appear to overlook her sometimes, or will mortify her, or haply provoke her to envy by narrations of springs of adventure and interest, travel, pictures, music, books, cultivated society, which may be entirely beyond the so-called inferior's reach ; and, at the same time, the better born, or more richly endowed ofthe companions will feel hurt by her friend's coy ness, stiffness, pride, when she herself only meant to be kind and social. Again, with the humble friend the girl in the middle class will run the very same risks, only changing the checkers ; and with the greatly increased peril of effecting something seriously detrimental to the permanent wellbeing of the other, because a simple, scantily-educated girl is not by many degrees so well armed against an injury to her native dignity, self-respect, con tentment, and her just balance of social advantages, as a well-taught, well-read, thoughtful girl in a station above her. Therefore good and judicious parents and guar dians are chary of unsuitable intimacies for their children, unless under their own eye, and within certain bounds. Yet they are safe enough, even for the thoughtless and weak, if the heart be but wholesomely set on duty, and salted with grace. The writer, after having stated her general objec tions to these friendships, would like to record her conviction, that occasions are constantly occurring which defy our ordinary standards, when such half-"], [209, "Friendship. 197 proscribed bonds become strong and tight, and bind soul to soul in danger and trial with true love knots, which death will only unloose, for a higher life to tie again firmly for ever. Without question such accidental alliances as these are apt to be con sidered \u2014 have often proved \u2014 providential unions, calculated to confer mighty blessings, and to sur vive the artificial obligations which forbade them. People say truly, it is a respectable thing to see an elderly couple surrounded by old-fashioned, well kept furniture, according much better with the tear and wear of years than bran new upholstery of a higher cast, and more elegant material and manu facture. The mothers' grey heads, and stout or lean persons, become their matronly though sober and rather quaint caps and shawls a world before an elaborate travestied edition of their youngest daughter's wreath of flowers and lace mantilla. In the same way, family friends are respectable, albeit sometimes troublesome institutions. A long established house, with but recent guests, varying v/ith each varying phase of the household, is a very sorry sight. \" Your own friend, and your father's friend, forget not,\" is a very gracious pro verb ofthe wise man. Here our fine folk of the middle classes might profitably borrow a lesson from the aristocracy whom they task themselves to imitate or mimic. Class fidelity, disinterested remembrance of ancient allies, persistent, persevering friendliness to fallen"], [210, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 198 fellows, are the honourable characteristics where noblesse oblige. One grievous flaw in our magnates of the middle class is the horrible, heartless snobbishness with which they learn to cut their cronies, and cast whole circles from them, as a reptile casts its slough, or a mealy butterfly its chrysalis. We would have our girls put up with some incon venience, be capable of some self-sacrifice, to maintain their own friends, and their fathers' friends, intact. Be sure the one true friend, the invaluable counsellor, the joyous confidante, the loving consoler, is mostly to be cut out of such tried and trusty stuff; not out of the slight, dig nified acquaintance of yesterday, the facile supe rior, won by base flattery or material gain, to be the reluctant abettor of follies, the yawning spec tator of vanities, and the sneering satirist of ab surdities. Your mother's contemporary may be narrow-minded and dogmatic, but she will tie on her bonnet with trembling fingers to run to your sick-bed ; she will be all the same to you, or rather far more cordial and warmer-hearted because your father has lost money in an unlucky speculation, or even been compelled, with bowed head and aching heart, to read his name in the bankrupt list. She may find fault with you to your face ; but she will sternly rebut cruel, cowardly scandal, which attacks you like an assassin behind your back.

Reflect that you yourselves, in the march of the future, with its innumerable chances and changes, may be destined to misfortune and adversity. Certainly, even though you continue in reasonable affluence of health and wealth, you will at some time or other grow prosaic if not peevish, old-fashioned if not obsolete. Then, even if from no more ex alted motive than doing as you would be done by, show yourself generous to those who have lost your advantages, if they ever possessed them. Deserve friends among your equals, and cherish them for better, for worse, as God's gift, among the very first of gifts after His own presence ; be conscientious towards friends of another degree ; and be gentle, very gentle to your own friends, and your father's friends, of other days. DAME DOROTHY. \"These two girls are great friends;\" so said Miss Lavinia Blount to her old assistant, con-"], [212, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 200 fidante, and cousin, Miss Sophy Blount, in her northern boarding-school near a great northern town. It was an old-fashioned school, where there was more sewing than reading, and more manners than accomplishments. Miss Lavinia was an old-fashioned woman, sharp and rigid, wor ried into crossness by boarders' flights and parents' fumes, and stiff with the incessant maintenance of her own angular code of manners. But Miss Lavinia had a heart \u2014 an appendage the world is given to deny to her kind, notwithstanding they are no more covetous than the Jews, and Shylock established their community of interest with the public in that matter, even when he alternated, \" My ducats, and my daughter.\" I wish all the fat, easy matrons, and all the bland, caressing matrons, had the brains which lay beneath Miss Lavinia's turban, and the heart which beat behind Miss Lavinia's busk. \" Ain't they something like what you and I were, Sophy, long ago at Alnwick?\" observed Miss Lavinia, in a softer tone. It was not easy to think of Miss Lavinia and Miss Sophy as thoughtless young things, but doubtless that event had been a historical fact at some period in the annals of the Percys and the north. An idea had struck Miss Lavinia, and when the girls curtsied to her, after they had closed their work-bags for the night, and were preparing to re tire to their rooms, she called Miss Anne Baldwin"], [213, "Friendship. 201 and Miss Dorothy Fenton to stand before her chair. The girls were not conscious of any fault, so they were placid and smiling. It is just possible \u2014 I believe it admits of a fraction of proof \u2014 that a school-mistress may be just and generous. Of course, she is generally a mean tyrant, \u2014 keeping company with girls seems to have this effect ; but occasionally, you know, just for exception's sake, you may suppose her a worthy soul in buckram. \" The holidays occur next week, and I shall be very busy till then, and you, Dorothy, and you, Anne, return home for good immediately after wards.\" \" Yes, ma'am,\" answered the girls at once, with broad smiles, associating the full swing of liberty and indulgence with home, as it would be a great pity they should fail to do ; but yet their dancing eyes were caught by Miss Lavinia's hawk's-eye, and fixed a little wistfully on her furrowed fore head. Sundry festivals she had instituted, games she had fostered, sicknesses she had nursed, and, above all, Miss Lavinia's face, on a summer night, or a winter afternoon, when, all tasks done, she had merely sat and contemplated her humming, buzzing charge \u2014 these fascinated them and lingered in their imaginations. \" You have been great friends, you two ; see that you don't soon forget each other. My cousin Sophy and I were bed-fellows when we had curly"], [214, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 202 heads of our own, and we have kept to each other through life, and stood by each other through good and bad. I believe we'll die under the same roof, and be buried in the same corner of the church yard.\" The girls looked doubtfully at each other, per haps they gave a little involuntary rejecting wave of their cropped heads. Dying and burying made their flesh creep ; they seemed pale and cold as the moon to the young girls. The association between Miss Lavinia and Miss Sophy had not much to recommend it in their eyes ; they saw only its work-a-day character ; they did not under stand its faithfulness. As for them, they would not be like Miss Lavinia and Miss Sophy, though these two women were good, kind mistresses, and they had a respect and a liking for them ; they would be something entirely different. However, they had no difficulty in promising warmly to Miss Lavinia that they would be true as steel to each other. Miss Lavinia dismissed Anne Baldwin, and re tained Dorothy Fenton. \" Dorothy,\" she said, looking into a little face whose chief charm was its demureness, \" you know you are younger than Anne ; your father, though a respectable man, is not of so much consequence in the country as Squire Baldwin. You found Anne the head girl, oldest, cleverest (and cleverness goes some way in a school), liveliest, grandest. Anne had plenty of"], [215, "Friendship. 203 friends ; but she selected you, a quiet little thing, from the moment that she set eyes upon you. If you had not been marked out by Anne's choice, I am afraid you would have been rather lost sight of among your companions, and Miss Sophy and I could not have helped it much, though we had tried ever so hard. Anne brought you out, she cured your home-sickness, she encouraged your shamefacedness, she made you contented and happy. But, Dorothy, though Anne did you great good at an important stage of your life, this has happened when you were two young girls, and you will live to hear and read a great deal in disparage ment and scorn of girlish likings ; still I think you will be base if you forget it.\" \" But I will not forget it, Miss Lavinia,\" Dorothy pleaded, with widening, deepening eyes. \" I hope not, Dorothy ; I hope not ; but don't be too sure in your own strength ; our friendships are sometimes cruelly tried ; and I have seen girls and girls interlace their arms and press their cheeks together for a whole year, and not know each other on the streets within six little weeks. It is bad, Dorothy. I hope better things of you, but I want to warn you. You never heard me flatter ; so I think you will believe me when I say I consider you the steadier girl of the two. Anne is a fine, handsome, kind girl, sure to be admired and liked ; but she is rash and impulsive. You are still, firm, and persevering. It may be that"], [216, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 204 Anne will be volatile, but you must lend her your discretion. It may be that Anne will have her troubles, and fight against them like a wild bird in a cage, but you will stand by and coax the bird to eat and drink ; and when the time comes to open the cage-door, you will fly with it to its nest, Dorothy Fenton.\" Dorothy did not answer, but she looked with her shy eyes full into Miss Lavinia's face. There was something puzzled, even a little stolid and stubborn, in her expression. Many persons would have been mortally disappointed in it ; but Miss Lavinia judged otherwise. \" That girl will cer tainly do what I have said, so that the opportunity be granted to her.\" Who knows but she may \" save a soul alive, and cover a multitude of sins ?\" and Miss Lavinia rose and went about her night's duties. Anne Baldwin and Dorothy Fenton went back to homes plain and boisterous, according to the fashion of the time and place. They entered into the society of their age and station, and at tended the usual number of merry - makings in their scarlet morocco shoes, short-waisted gowns, and hair in clubs, lifted up on the crowns of their heads, rendering Anne Baldwin, a tall woman by nature, a giantess by art, and Dorothy Fenton a very funnily toupeed little girl. The girls did not reside in the same district, and did not meet above once or twice a year ; but they kept up a regular"], [217, "Friendship. 205 correspondence by letters ; queer, original letters, not very well spelt, or very grammatically phrased (save Miss Lavinia !), but quite individual epistles, full of a flow of nonsense on Anne's part, and showing a tripping march of sense on Dorothy's side. Yet, strange to say, it was the sensible, painstaking letters which were the most affection ate in their constancy. There were interregnums in Anne's quips and cranks, and then there were sure to arrive two or three pages in succession of Dorothy's comical sedateness, when Anne re proached herself violently for her neglect, and was extremely attentive till the next temptation. In course of time the girls married. All girls married then as duly as they put up their back hair, and wore whalebone in their sleeves ; and one reason of the uniformity of the custom was, that they regarded marriage purely on the Turkish principle of fatality, and married when they were asked, without any vexatious delay on the question of taste, or I am afraid of feeling. There is posi tively something imposing in the equanimity with which our ancestresses accepted their fates, often without moving a muscle to influence them. \" If it's ordained I maun take him, Who will I get but Tarn Glen,\" was a sentiment thoroughly credited and universally followed. Either there was a mistake in the theory that every woman had her tide to love and be loved,"], [218, "206 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. or the mischievous Pucks must have been particu larly busy at that season of the world's history. Whom did Anne and Dorothy marry ? Be sure not two likely lads as they were girls. Anne married an old bachelor, finical and fractious ; Dorothy married a blustering, rough-riding widower, with half a score of children, some of them as old as herself. Mr. Crossthwaite of Crossthwaite was caught by Annie's boldness and blitheness ; so different from his own pining, peevish humours. Mr. Annesley of Waveringlea was caught by Dorothy's youthful staidness. But what caught the girls ? Nothing but the divine right of matri mony. They did not even name it as an induce ment, though they reckoned it a lucky chance that the two square, solid, unornamented, grey stone houses of Crossthwaite and Waveringlea, built as if to resist storms, were raised on lands which marched acre to acre in that Valley of the Tyne, where the smoke of the blast - furnaces was just beginning to shrivel the apple- blossoms in the Tyne orchards. If any girl is tempted to be as regardless of con sequences as these women of a bygone generation \u2014 and satirists harp on such to this day \u2014 they had better ascertain if they have spirits to bear the for tune in the sequel ; not mount to Arthur's throne if they cannot wind Arthur's horn. What lives Anne and Dorothy led ! What trials they en dured ! Not that they complained often. Not"], [219, "Friendship. 207 that they considered their lots particularly hard, or reflected on Providence after the first flush of their sanguine simplicity leapt out in their honeymoons. Mr. Crossthwaite was a weary, wizzened, what they called in old language, humoursome man ; to be felt for too, because he was poor and proud ; and if he had not a great soul, he had certainly a sensitive temper. His aged querulousness was more than a match for Anne's youthful cheerful ness. In place of Anne crossing and racking Mr. Crossthwaite, it was he who crossed and racked Anne, until the determined, headstrong woman waned into a being as fretful and nervous as him self. And all the time, Mr. Crossthwaite no more meant to injure his wife, than any other honour able, Christian gentleman who worries himself and his partner out of all the calmness and elasticity of existence. Anne knew that he was innocent of evil intentions ; and she herself was neither malignant nor revengeful, though she was cross many a time, so cross, that she declared they had been called Crossthwaite on purpose. She sub mitted to his whims and crotchets, piques and pas sions, like a tolerably resigned, hapless slave, and only once thought of flying in his face, breaking from his bonds, running away and setting up a separate establishment. That was when Mr. Crossthwaite had a bitter quarrel with Mr. An nesley, and each gentleman forbade his wife, on the pain of his utmost displeasure, to pass the"], [220, "208 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. threshold of his neighbour. They said nothing of the hills and fells, however, and there the two middle-aged women held a tryst like a pair of lovers. I think there was something far sadder and more pathetic in that single rendezvous on the hillside, and seat on the turf-dyke, than in many lovers' meetings and partings. No future to look forward to, no entire and perfect union in antici pation ; only the privilege of sharing each other's cares and sorrows ! Two beaten women, in caps with lace borders, and black bonnets, and coats not unlike their husbands' driving-coats, and uncouth country mittens, holding each other's hands, and looking into each other's sore-lined faces ! Anne raged and cried like a frank, impetuous woman. Mr. Crossthwaite was ill to please ; so fault-finding, that no servant would put up with him. It was lonely at Crossthwaite without either chick or child. Anne would have made up to the next heir, but Mr. Crossthwaite had a spite at him, and w_s sure he would start a furnace in the old rookery whenever he, Mr. Crossthwaite, was gone. Anne would not mind it, if Mr. Crossthwaite sank for iron and smelted it under the windows ; there would be some stir, and some glow about the place ; the roughest Northumbrian burr of the miners and keelmen would be better than the croak of the crows that was so dismal, and never another thing did she hear but Mr. Crossthwaite's thin voice snap, snapping at everything and everybody. He"], [221, "Friendship. 209 was not aware of it, but he was killing her by inches. And now, Dorothy, her old schoolfellow \u2014 Do, who listened to her, and comforted her, and helped her, if ever woman did another, \u2014 she was to see her no more. Anne could not bear this last drop in her cup, she could not bear it ! (A hard saying that ; not to bear the cross which we have helped to fit on our own shoulders.) Dorothy had been listening with her old stillness, which ren dered her a welcome recipient of her vivacious neighbour's rush of fun and folly once. I think it was Mr. Annesley who set aside Dorothy by that title of Dame Dorothy, to hold her distinct in his memory from another dame, his first help meet. At any rate, she was commonly known in the country, and she was mostly mentioned at Waver inglea as Dame Dorothy. Her name remained on a grimy Tyne ship long after it had died away from living lips. She was a very close woman ; one of those women whom the open, indifferent world is inclined to regard with distrust, and who, therefore, become peculiarly the property of their family and friends, remain devoted to them, are prized by them as gold. To all Mrs. Crossthwaite's boiling-over con fessions, Dame Dorothy had said little or nothing of her own experience. It was only by vague but persistent rumour that Anne had acquired a notion that all was not well at Waveringlea, that Dorothy \u2014 quiet, composed Dorothy \u2014 had o"], [222, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 210 her own contentions. Now Dorothy just lifted the veil : gave a glimpse of the husband, not un kind in his better moments, but in his worse, gross in his habits and shameful in his excesses ; of the step- children, riotous and rebellious, straining at the reins, and indignant at her rule ; of her own children, looked upon as aliens and intruders ; and of her own faith and honesty suspected every hour, because the little ones were her flesh and blood. Anne shrank back horrified. But Dorothy was quiet ; Dorothy was not calling herself a victim ; Dorothy was not thinking of throwing down her trust, and escaping out into the wide world to live for self, and ease, and pleasure. Like cold water to a fevered man, or the fresh breeze to a fainting body, Dorothy's patience and self-possession came across Anne's passions. Anne grew calm under the influence ; she rose up in her right mind. \" It is true we all have our battles to fight ; we must do our best, my lass,\" she granted gently. There is something very touch ing in a high-spirited woman's meekness. There is something also that \" gars the heart grow grit\" in girlish appellations, exchanged by shrivelled lips. \" Dorothy,\" said Anne, with a sorrowful smile, \" do you remember when we first came Tyne ways, I once nearly quarrelled with you, because you chanced to sit above me at the table at the Oakshaw gathering ? But the next time you took the lowest place, though your husband was the"], [223, "Friendship. 211 older, weightier man, and you smiled and nodded up to me. I never saw you look so gay.\" Life went on wearing its channels deeper, and sealing the impression of its scars. Mr. Cross thwaite, from being a discontented, restless man, waxed irritable and jealous, to a degree that was little short of mania. Anne dared no longer resist or oppose him. Anne grew to quake at that white worn face, those quavering accents, and clutching fingers, more than Dorothy dreaded her husband's thick, stuttering voice, staggering step, and blind, purposeless fits of fury. Mr. Crossthwaite had always been offended by the iron-works. A narrow-minded, arrogant man, he hated to see another class rising up to crow over, thrust aside, and trample down the smaller squires. He had not the funds to work the minerals on his own property, and he took an insane pride in re fusing the largest bribe to lease them to others. Waveringlea bordered Crossthwaite. Mr. An nesley had reason to suppose that the same metals were to be found on both estates. He had pro posed trying their nature, and bringing them into the market himself ; but his irregular, wasteful life had left him with little power for enterprise. At last, when some additional fuel fed the flame of his feud with Mr. Crossthwaite, he swore he would be even with his adversary on this score. Nay, he would get his foot before him, and leave Cross thwaite far in the rear."], [224, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 212 Mr. Crossthwaite might not choose to bore and dig for his own stone, and blast it when secured ; but he could not prevent Mr. Annesley turning up and smelting his. There, right in front of the windows of the old Northumbrian mansion-house, would rise the pyramids of red brick, belching fire and smoke, the rows of mean labourers' houses, the heaps of calcined ore, the pegs of dull, leaden coloured metal. What although the sky should be all ablaze of nights with the furnace-flames, and the roar be like the roar of the sea, and drowsy darkness and quiet should forsake the neighbour hood for ever ? What although the sickening fumes ofthe roasted stone should be carried by the lightest wind to blacken the linen bleaching on Mrs. Crossthwaite's green, to blight Mrs. Crossthwaite's flowers in their straight beds, and ascend far above her sweet Nancies and March violets, to turn the weak stomach and the dizzy head of the fine gen tleman who now owned Crossthwaite ? Mr. Annesley could not help that, he declared, with a horse-laugh. In this free England of ours, every man acts for his own interest, and lets his neigh bours' concerns take care of themselves. Mrs. Crossthwaite wrote to her old friend, Mrs. Annesley, a piteous letter, very different from her old letters with their merry chronicles of parties, partners, and fashions. If Mr. Annesley did as he threatened, she believed Mr. Crossthwaite would go mad. She did not think his life would be safe,"], [225, "Friendship. 213 or hers, or the Annesleys. She prayed to be saved from her misery. She implored Dorothy to inter pose, and stand between her and her doom. Dorothy approached the subject in her own way. She addressed Mr. Annesley one day when he was at home, alone with her in her sitting room, in his senses, and clumsily kind with a species of contrition, as he was wont to be on these occasions. \" Tony, I've not been a bad wife to you.\" \" You have not, Dorothy ; but I had rather that you did not remind me you've done your duty ; I like to find that out for myself, my woman ; I've a prejudice on the point,\" he remonstrated with himself and her, as if he foreboded reproaches, or his conscience galled him. \"And I've not asked any _ favours of you, Tony.\" \" Oh, is that it ?\" brightening greatly. \" It is the silk gown at last, and you shall have it, Dame Dorothy, as thick as leather, and as shiny as seal skin, if money can procure it. The first dame's shall be nothing to it, for I must confess, though she was the bigger woman, you are the better bar- gain.\" \" Tony, will you delay the mine in the Beck field, for my sake ?\" Annesley's brow grew black, and his veins be gan to swell on his forehead, and to tighten his neckcloth."], [226, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 214 \" It is only delay, Tony ; that man's life is a bad one.\" \" It shall be in that man's life ; it would not be half worth, if he were not here to see it,\" shouted Annesley. \" I know you are short of money ; you will be better provided for the outfit when a few more years have come and gone, and the mortgage is paid and done with. I will save every penny of money I can lay by for you, in the meantime.\" \" If I could not get the money to borrow, I would beg it, my wife.\" Tony mocked her. \" You remember, I would not consent to Mar tin's coming home again, because he was wild and frantic when interfered with ; I will try him another time, Tony. And I was pressing you to send away little Susan to school, that she might have the same advantages which her sisters received, and which I enjoyed myself for that matter ; but I think I will manage to give her what I know at home, and avoid straitening you in that quarter.\" He sat looking at her with a strange expression. He was a rude, ungoverned man, but he was not incapable of responding to rare magnanimity. \" I do not understand you, Dorothy,\" he said at last ; \" you have taken me aback ; but I see this sparing that venomous, puny caitiff, Crossthwaite, is very near your heart, else you would not make these offers.

And Dame Dorothy could not do enough for her husband, or beg his pardon more humbly in her unobtrusive manner, though he never reminded her of the obligation, or complained of the deferring of his hopes and wishes. Nay, he did not seem hurt by his con cession and pledge ; he was if anything a shade more moderate in his behaviour, and when he was not beside himself, he was kinder and kinder to Dorothy. One cold winter morning, when the water was frozen two inches in the water-barrel and the horse-trough, and the white clouds were curdled in the greenish-blue of a December sun-rise, and the drowsy farm-folk were only creeping abroad in the wreath of mist which hung over the mansion and its offices, and Dorothy had gone into the family room to set out the children's bread and milk, and inspect the toasting of Mr. Annesley's ale, and the infusing of her own cup of tea, she was startled by"], [228, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 216 a sharp tap on the thick glass of the window. A tall, wo-begone woman, with her clothes huddled on her back, and her hood tied over her sleeping cap, stood outside among the hoar-frost. \" Anne Baldwin, can this be you ?\" \" Yes, it is Anne Baldwin come back again. He's gone, Dorothy, poor Michael Crossthwaite is gone from this world ; he will never vex anybody more.\" \" When did it happen, Anne ?

Why did you not send, and I would have gone to you at any hour, night or day ?\" \" I cannot stay, Dorothy ; I cannot see his enemy ; but I came over on purpose to tell your husband of the death.

I have left my dead husband to strangers, to do your husband justice.\" \" Poor soul ! did she face the biting wind, and the dark morning, after she had seen his spirit pass, and wander here alone to see me get fair play, to give me notice that I might work out my ends \u2014 me that would have struck him where he lay ?

Give me the chance; I'll rather sit lightly to my cups, and come home as sober as his Reverence for the remnant of my days.\" And Tony Annesley was as tender and respect ful to Anne Baldwin, as he was toward Dame Dorothy, in the latter end of his life. The effect of the honour and attachment of these two women did not end with them. The connexion between Dorothy and Anne was beautiful. It brought out the best traits of their characters, and these traits must have ultimately made their way with the most rugged natures. The bright shining of the pure regard between the two women must have been finally reflected from the dullest eyes. Besides, it was true, \u2014 what Dorothy stopped to record, \u2014 frank, high-spirited, impressionable Anne Baldwin, even crushed by misfortune, was a thousand times better fitted for a middle -woman and a peace maker in a family, than reserved, self-contained Dorothy Fenton."], [231, "219 \u25a0 CHAPTER VIII. LOVE. A thoughtful, kindly writer has spoken of the three great facts of life as birth, love, and death ; and again, of the common instinct by which every body listens to a love story of any kind. If young girls would treat love as one of three serious facts, and all false representations of it as lies, and, like all lies, base and degrading, their best friends would be saved a great deal of fruitless trouble. It is hard to deal with young girls when, accord ing to their different dispositions, quite as much as their different up-bringings, they begin, under the classes of fanciful, forward, foolish children, or matter-of-fact, prudent, bashful, blithe young women, to ponder \" love's young dream.\" My thought is that love, more than marriage, is made in heaven ; that it is an inspiration which descends upon us without our knowledge, and often"], [232, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 220 without our consent. Therefore, I would never presume to dictate the when, how, and whom of love. I would only presuppose that no good girl will consciously indulge and consummate by matri mony, a love for one whom she is forced to see is an utterly unworthy man. Granting this great barrier, true love will be its own best defender and avenger. I believe there is not half the danger in curred by its presence that is risked by its absence. I believe if the multitude of warnings against love in general were addressed solely against false love, it would be more for the moral benefit of society ; that is, if society would listen to the ad vice and lay it to heart. It is against spurious love that I would warn girls ; and, accordingly, such is the aim of this paper. I would disabuse love of all but its individual mystery, \u2014 delicate, hidden, and sacred as the reli gion of the soul. But with regard to the universal existence of a consecrated passion, human, yet par taking of the Divine, and its effects strong as death, which reaches forward into eternity, \u2014 why not openly acknowledge it ; talk with reverence of it ; accept it as a matter of faith, and often of ex ample ?

It is, in almost every case, our disengaged girls, the gadders on our streets, the Haunters before society, the showy, frivolous, arrogant, reckless gamblers for matrimonial stakes, who thus fall under just condemnation.

Blackness was a prim little sea- port, in spite of its salt flavour; more of a dwelling-place for retired men of business, and widows with settle ments and annuities, than a place of trade. It was a monotonous little town, though its ships went and came; and there was a marked equality through out the better class of its inhabitants. A widow's daughter, and a widower's son \u2014 a"], [242, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 230 young man of five-and-twenty, and a girl of twenty \u2014 both resident at Blackness, both well -enough born, well-enough inclined, well-enough educated, well-enough looking ! Surely there could be no great disparity here, and yet the sand and the surf in Blackness bay, which were destined to be con stantly together without ever amalgamating, were not more distinct from each other than Marjory Bruce and Jack Fergusson. Their coming toge ther at all was one of the curious and interesting puzzles of social life. Marjory Bruce, though she bore the name of a king's daughter, was a high-bred but humble minded girl ; a good deal put upon and kept down in the world's warfare. Her father was the only Bruce of Blackness who had gone abroad and not brought home money ; and the other Bruces and their families, who had been more energetic or more acquisitive, rode in a rough - shod fashion over Marjory and her mother. Mrs. Bruce, seeing her husband's kindred treat it as a grievous flaw on his part, that he had not gathered gain, grew to resent it on her own account ; and when the offender died, by some singular but perfectly prac ticable course of reasoning, she transferred the offence to his daughter, and always talked to her of what she might have been, and what she might have done, as if Marjory were at the bottom ofthe defalcation. She was a weak woman, was Mrs. Bruce ; weak in body and mind ; though I do not"], [243, "Love. 231 mean that she was not capable of knowing right from wrong, or of controlling her own actions. She invariably took the tone from those around her ; and she constantly required a grievance to nurse, and was well furnished, in the shape of her own delicate health, her narrow income, and Mar- jory's comparatively defenceless and unprovided- fbr condition \u2014 all contrasted with the robust health, full purses, and many brothers and sisters of the other Bruce houses. Marjory grew up in a poor soil ; she went abroad with a blight upon her, from her earliest years. She had never gone to church or into company, without previously listening to a lamentation on her plain bonnet, or her shabby shawl, or her washed muslin, or her cleaned gloves. Marjory might have grown out of this sound of woe a buxom and hilarious woman ; for such con- tradictions occasionally tell that the consequence of an injudicious regimen on the perverse plants of human nature is sometimes to send them shoot- ing and spinning in a direction quite contrary from what might have been expected. But, as it hap- pened, Marjory only grew up very sensible, rather indifferent to the forms on which her mother put so much weight, and with a racy strength and sweet- ness far down at the core of her heart, budding out of the sap, which had been so forced back and compressed within its boundaries of bark. Mar jory was not pretty (here another Jeremiad from her mother!), and she was not ugly. She was"], [244, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 232 strong rather than graceful ; she had a quantity of fine black hair, but though it was fine and well dressed, its weight and mass were detrimental to a heavy head and face ; and she had thick, straight eye-brows. Still her mouth was one of those beautiful, clear, delicate, yet full mouths, which redeem much plainer faces than Marjory's. She was not accomplished, and she was a little given to silence. But, for all that, I am proud to say, for the credit of Blackness, that she was admired and liked in her native town. I believe it was because she was thoroughly unaffected, be cause she was original ; and when she did speak, her words were worth listening to, and because she could be depended upon both by friends and foes. Not a more sincere girl in existence than Marjory Bruce, and that in spite of a subservient position, and many temptations to irony, if not to flattery. But, notwithstanding Marjory Bruce had her genuine admirers, it caused a great sensation at Blackness, when it spread abroad that Jack Fer gusson had engaged himself to her. Marjory would never have made it public. She would have kept all the joy and pride to herself, but Jack could keep nothing to himself; and really, poor fellow ! he was thoroughly proud and joyful over his conquest, in a way that might have done one good in this nonchalant, self- conceited age. It did bring water into Marjory Bruce's eyes an infinite number of times. \" I cannot think what"], [245, "Love. 233 Jack sees in me to cry out about ; a very hum drum, plain girl: nobody will envy his obtaining his choice ; but I should like to see who will per suade Jack of that fact.\" I should like to have seen who would have per- suaded Jack that Marjory Bruce was not the fairest, brightest, noblest, best woman that ever lived; that she was anything short of angelic. He was the manliest, ablest, handsomest, and, alas ! most facile fellow on this great globe. His father was a jovial, selfish man, holding a town's office. He was safe of his comforts and amusements dur- ing his life, and he left his boy to shift for himself. He liked him, I believe, but he never took any trouble about him. Jack hung as he grew any- how, adored by the servants, welcome to every house in the town, learning what he liked as a boy at the grammar-school, and leaving unlearned what he disliked, according to instinct or fancy. He saw no example of self-denial, and, absolutely, he had no idea of it. That was the seed of cor- ruption in a character otherwise one of the purest, truest, gentlest, most guileless that ever existed. He was clever too, acute, ingenious, but sadly desultory and volatile ; yet, I no more wonder that Marjory Bruce loved the ground he trod upon, stuck to him through thick and thin, bore with his failures and fallings away, and clung to him, than that she loved the sun above her head, and the flowers and grass beneath her feet."], [246, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 234 Mrs. Bruce did not cherish brilliant expectations of the connexion which Marjory was to form with Jack Fergusson. At certain times, she allowed that Jack was gentleman-like, popular, warm hearted ; but, then, he had no inheritance, he could not of necessity succeed to his father's office, though he was one of his clerks, and, I am afraid, the idlest and flightiest. If he had been like his father, now ! Actually, there is no accounting for tastes, \u2014 Mrs. Bruce preferred the portly, flesh gorging, wine-consuming father, who never did anything disagreeable, never even contemplated it, to the fine, brave, generous son. It would only be an engagement \u2014 still, it would prevent Marjory from drawing something like a prize in the lottery of life, though Mrs. Bruce had not before contemplated Marjory's making a fortune by marriage or otherwise. She had been accus tomed to anticipate her a pinched old maid, with little to do, and few to care for her. Neverthe less, Mrs. Bruce grumbled over Jack Fergusson's broad shoulders and his beard ; grumbled over him, as he helped Marjory to find her ferns, and train her dog, Ranger, as he brought her home from her aunt's carpet-dances, as he was even induced to sit and read to her sober, earnest books, on sober, earnest occasions (and you have no idea how diffi cult it was to arrest Jack, and fix him on a seat, and constrain him to let his thoughts follow the guidance of another, however lofty and loveable"], [247, "Love. 235 the teacher), as he hung about Marjory, like the miser about his treasure. Mrs. Bruce, Marjory's mother, talked about Marjory's engagement to the other Mrs. Bruces \u2014 the wealthy, dashing Mrs. Bruces, whose daughters had contracted no engagements \u2014 until she saw it a very doubtful good for Marjory, \u2014 a long, dangling engagement, noised abroad by the in considerateness and indelicacy of Jack Fergusson, compromising Marjory, doing her a world of harm, in fact, one of those flowery snares, which, in the end, hang like a noose about one's neck, if they do not strangle the breath out of one's body. And, so as water frets stone, Mrs. Bruce began to drop, drop peevish murmurs, and evil prognostications against Marjory's engagement, and Marjory's future ; against Jack Fergusson, Jack's jests, Jack's restlessness, Jack's love of company, Jack's imprudence and extravagance, Jack's whole man, Jack's whole prospects. Marjory had to fight against two anomalies. Mrs. Bruce, who must needs be the echo of some body, was the echo of the selfish, hard sisters-in law, who lorded it over her, and bespattered her with their patronage, whom, in her secret heart, she disliked and feared, and not the echo of Mar jory, her own daughter, and only child, whom she loved as well as she could love any human being. \" Only listen to me, mother ; only hear what I've got to say,\" Marjory would implore in vain. In"], [248, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 236 this case, \" familiarity bred contempt,\" the consan guinity of the speaker, the power Mrs. Bruce pos sessed over her, the affection Mrs. Bruce entertained for her, were so many barriers against her \u2014 barred the doors of so much reason as Mrs. Bruce in herited against Marjory's and Jack Fergusson's opinions and arguments, and opened them wide to the slights and sneers, the innuendoes and hinted commiseration of her sisters-in-law, and their sa tellites. And, be it said, the ill-natured gossips of Blackness proceeded to hang Jack Fergusson at a very early date in his history. The other hopeless quicksand in which poor Marjory floundered, was the notable circumstance that some of Jack Fergusson's virtues did the work of vices against him, degraded him in the world's estimation, liked and loved as he was, exposed him to danger, rendered doubly, trebly precarious his very unstable fortunes. It was honourable in Jack that he never courted a man for his wealth and rank ; that he had a decided inclination to stoop to those who were unjustly slighted and de spised ; and, I daresay, it was because he had a conviction that Marjory Bruce was not so exalted as she should have been, that fools preferred more skin-deep qualities, or more mercenary lures, that he rushed to adore her. Above all, he was hot and passionate for the wronged, and started to their rescue with a headlong gallantry becoming a squire who had his spurs to win. Now all this"], [249, "Love. 237 might bring Jack nearer the kingdom of heaven, but it by no means promoted his interests on earth, seeing that he was not a pillar of discretion on his own foundation; that he was rash, self-indulgent (it was Jack's impulses which were fine), confi dent, careless. And Marjory heard continually of Jack's rubs with society, and had continually to condemn the world for base injustice on his account. Of course, Jack Fergusson did not get on in his father's office, \u2014 the easiest place for his father to put him. He had no great scope for his talents, and his occasional fits of industry ; and he did not improve what scope he had. He did not advance as attorney, agent, banker, whatever branch of calling he meant to adhere to. At the end of two years, he was no farther forward in the world ; he was far ther back. He had lost a portion of the confidence of embryo clients, embryo borrowers and lenders ; he was not a hair's-breadth nearer keeping a house and maintaining a wife, to which he had been guilty of the ambition \u2014 presumption, Mrs. Bruce called it now \u2014 of aspiring. The Mrs. Bruces (aunts) shook their heads more ominously and emphati cally, and whispered, Should not something be done ; would not husband number one, or husband number two interfere, apply the goad to Jack Fer gusson's laziness and levity, or free Marjory ofthe engagement by a quarrel and a rupture ? Marjory and Jack Fergusson laughed aloud at"], [250, "238 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. that conclusion in the twilight parlour ; laughed in utter derision, with their hearts warm and fond, with their bodies vigorous and blooming, with Jack's last kiss on Marjory's yielding lips, and his last look in her eyes, which had learnt to beam back the flash of his own, as the sea reflects the sun. But, for all the laughter, the relatives' and acquaintances' friendly suggestion infused sundry drops of gall into Jack's spirit. What ! wrench him asunder from Marjory ; ruin him ; blast his heart and life because he did not arrive fast enough at promotion ! The harpies, the screws, the horrible curmudgeons ! From that moment, Marjory detected a subtle but potent element of hostility, kept in the back ground not to vex her, but sufficiently active in all Jack's dealings with her kindred. Jack began to look upon himself as an ill-used man, to feel hated, to grow reckless, desperate. It was Marjory that proposed to Jack Fergusson to go abroad, to cross the seas, brave rough pas sages, foreign railways, strange climates, unfriendly faces. After much sad reflection and many prayers, it seemed to her that it would be best for him, and she brought herself to recommend it. She did not mind herself, of course. She would follow. It would be easy for her when he was there ; easy, when Marjory suffered from one of those strange, constitutional weaknesses which beset many wise men and women. She had a positive horror of the"], [251, "Love. 239 sea, as rolling and buffeting its surges round a tem porary home. She could not sail a few hours without uneasiness and apprehension, and yet she could propose to traverse an ocean, single-handed, for a glance of Jack Fergusson's eye, at a beckon of Jack Fergusson's hand. There are women who can be so mad. Jack was startled by the proposal, but he liked it, and a very little time served to reconcile him to it as feasible and promising. It seems to me that Jack's willingness was an instance of his selfishness \u2014 no, not his selfishness, Jack was not selfish, but self-indulgent, there is a broad demarcation- \u2014 even though Marjory was silly enough to instigate him. He could have put his shoulders to the wheel, and managed the business at home, if he had spent his whole strength upon it, and relinquished other de lectation than what was included in doing his own particular work, and looking forward to his own particular wages ; if he had condescended to small beginnings, and braced himself, like a Titan or Trojan, to unflinching efforts. But, you perceive, it was a much simpler and more agreeable affair, for a man with Jack's education and tendencies, to set off in pursuit of adventures, on a wild-goose chase for a ready-made fortune, \u2014 a Whittington of the nineteenth century. There was Jack's destination to settle, and his outfit to prepare, and the parting to be gone through ; an event from which his mind was to be"], [252, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 240 diverted by change of scene and active progress, while Marjory was to brood over it during the tedious course of the draughts and plasters of her mother's spring influenza. Mrs. Bruce was not propitiated by Jack's with drawal from the scene ; she did not see in it a chance of an escape for Marjory from an unlucky contract, or she resented that Marjory should have that chance ; and, on the whole, she was more bent on seeing in it the fact of Marjory's banishment to the Colonies, and to mourn over her as an inno cent convict, and herself as a deserted mother. She softened a little at the last moment, and allowed Jack to kiss her, and cried aster his de parting footsteps ; but her grief took the' form of prognosticating storms and shipwrecks, revelling in yellow fevers and choleras, and being quite certain that she should never see him again ; and Marjory was as good as a widow, and Mrs. Bruce knew, to her cost, what it was to be a widow in this unfeel ing world. If Marjory had been a little German girl, now, she might have openly superintended Jack's outfit, trotted with him to the shops where he made his purchases, manufactured a large portion of his wearing apparel with her own busy fingers, accom panied him in his farewell visits, and never halted till she had seen him on board ship. The customs of the country were against Marjory, but I believe she thought night and day for his benefit ; she"], [253, "Love. 241 hunted up the woman who was to be his semp stress, and intrusted him with the card of her name and terms, which he mislaid twice \u2014 envying every stitch the woman sewed for him. She read all the books of information, at which he merely glanced, and, in the end, she knew a vast deal more about his destination and designs than he did, and she besieged heaven for blessings on his head. When the parting came, she kept him up. You often hear it said of some poor, slight woman, in her day of distress, that she cannot show her feelings, she must stifle them, in order to support some lump of a fellow, who would break down otherwise. Jack Fergusson was manly ; he would put a brave, cheery face on matters ; but when he took fare well (\" good-bye,\" he called it, for he would not have termed it taking farewell for the world), his impetuous heart was ready to break, and she knew that, and smiled upon him to the last. Jack was gone, and Marjory was alone, dread fully alone, after these last two years, at Blackness. She saw other girls light-hearted, comfortable, con fidential, expecting their brothers for a week at midsummer, or when the universities and courts were broken up, or at Christmas. She heard all the blithe anticipations, the merry appointments, the laughing retrospects. Young Mrs. Alison, who had met and married a Blackness man since Marjory was engaged to Jack Fergusson, made Marjory a party to her dismal condition when Mr. Q."], [254, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 242 Alison went yachting for a fortnight, or on a tour in the Highlands, or to London, on his business. And Marjory, herself, was stealing out, and walk ing forlorn through the plantations, and by the stream \u2014 the old haunts ; or sitting, heart-sick, on the shore, watching the sea-gulls vanishing beyond the horizon, and thinking of her Jack, wandering at the ends ofthe earth. The old Scotch songs teem with the eeriness of such plights ; hundreds of Nellies \" languish\" in their forgotten verses \u2014 u Here awa, there awa, Wandering Willie, Here awa, there awa, hie awa hame.\" \" Nae mair at Logan Kirk will he, Atween the preachings meet wi1 me.\" \" Now I gang lanesome and dowie and wae.\" Sing these songs to yourselves in the pensive gloam ing, and you girls will understand the state far better than I can explain it to you. You have all heard of home- sickness ; it is hard to bear; so hard that there is a pathetic, deep-meaning pro verb, \" Blessed are the home-sick, for they shall see home ;\" but home-sickness is as nothing com pared to the tugging at the heart-strings, when one who is the desire of the eyes is removed out of sight and hearing ; when one who is knit to the heart as a second being is carried away to the ex tremities of land and sea, and a blank and a chasm left behind in the bleeding heart. Such a watch, such a waiting is very trying to any tender woman ; enough, if she has no other refuge, to wear the flesh"], [255, "Love. 243 from her bones, drain the blood from her heart, and draw the light from her eyes. But when the object of devotion is a fine, thoughtless fellow like Jack Fergusson, who may be running his head against a post, or rushing slap-dash into a whirlpool any day ; when the woman has advised, or even abetted his exile \u2014 oh, pity that woman, and take care to say to her, as Mrs. Bruce said tc Marjory, \" Child, if you don't shake yourself up, and pluck up a spirit, and go out amongst other young people, you'll fall into a decline. I wish you had never seen that lad Fergusson's face ; but if he ever comes back again, he'll find you wrinkled and grey - headed before your time. And how will Jack Fergusson pay you back for your foolish cares, Marjory ? Girl, if he thinks you fallen off, and finds you no longer to his mind (and really, Marjory Bruce, you look an old woman already for your years), he won't have a gift of you and your love ! \" This is one climax for which girls are eager to barter their first joyousness. It must have its re deeming features too, I suppose, just as you hear the oppressed mother of a troublesome family de clare honestly that she would not be without her plagues, and dwell in peace and at leisure, for all the gold, gear, tranquillity, and amusement of her childless neighbour multiplied a thousandfold. So Marjory would not have gone back two or three years in her existence, and lived again without a"], [256, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 244 constant source of anxiety and yearning for that broad-shouldered wanderer, no, not for any con ceivable reward ! We all know the proverb about the rolling stone, and have had frequent opportunities of testing it. A mercurial, thin-skinned fellow like Jack Fer gusson, who does no good at home, does not often do much good (in a money-making sense) abroad. Jack, tired of the vain attempt, and longing to see Marjory again, returned home con siderably poorer than he went away. Poor Jack ! his ship was spoken at Blackness on the very eve of the marriage of one of Marjory's cousins. Such a satisfactory marriage ; so excel lent, so unexceptionable in every way ! A great merchant's son, holding a commission in the army, visiting some of the best people in the town, saw Louisa at a pic-nic, was struck with her figure, and enchanted with her singing got an introduction, and made up the match in no time. Louisa was getting such ornaments, such dresses ; for the regi ment was particularly gay, and the colonel's wife particularly fond of young matrons under her wing ; and Louisa was to set up with a man-servant and a barouche at once. Louisa's mother had reason to be pleased and happy. Mrs. Bruce wondered, in a cutting way, that some people could be so shame less as to choose that time of all others to re appear in the town, and inflict fresh annoyance and heavier mortification. Marjory was wearied of"], [257, "Love. 245 representing that Jack Fergusson was not a pro phet to predict Loo's marriage ; that he could not help his ship's coming in, and that he was not to linger on in the great sea-port ; and that in a Chris tian country a man need not be banned outright, because he has not hit on the philosopher's stone. I can fancy Marjory's distraction of spirit at this time ; her eagerness to welcome Jack Fergusson home again ; her quick fear lest he should be keenly pained at the result of his travels ; the necessity she was under of obeying her mother, and deferring to her ; the vexation inflicted by her enforced attendance at Louisa's marriage, with the invidious contrasts and condolences it provoked. If Marjory had dared, instead of knotting favours and fastening bouquets, she would far rather have been making thoughtful provision for the serious gaps in Jack's spent wardrobe, laying up stores of neck-ties and collars, and slippers for Jack's weary feet, that the poor fellow might appear respectable among his equals. I can see poor Jack's return at the fall of the night, in the fall of the year. Poor Jack ! No trumpets sounding before him ; no train gone out to meet him. It was not worth while announcing the event to his father, for the purple -faced old gentleman would not have refused an invitation, or risked his mutton being overdone, or his port wine corked in consequence. Jack had writ ten a hurried note to Marjory Bruce, but of"], [258, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 246 course Marjory could not blazon the news ; so Jack turned in to his native town from the rail way-station when the lamps were lighting, and when he was free to walk the streets as a stranger. He came like the German Wandelbursch, brown and dusty, travel-stained and aching with fatigue; and he trudged along just as that other pilgrim did, peering wistfully into the unconscious faces, feeling as if he had been much longer away, sensible that the town looked narrow and small and finical, yet that it thrilled him to a far greater degree than any of the rousing commercial cities \u2014 where men struck the iron when it was hot, and forged pedes tals and statues to themselves and mammon before they drew breath. Jack could encounter no little mother like the Wandelbursch's returning from the church, recognising him at a glance, and falling with a cry of gladness on his breast, never paus ing to look whether his staff bore a knapsack, or whether it presented a bare pole ; but Jack was more fortunate in his sweetheart. Jack, in his straightforward, heedless way, was plodding right to the Bruces' cottage, when at the corner of the garden -wall, beneath the bour -tree bush with its white June flowers when he went away \u2014 hang ing in black winter berries now, a woman started forward, clasped two hands tight upon his arm, and laid her head on his shoulder. \" I have only brought back myself, Marjory, do you know?\" Jack asked, with a long-drawn"], [259, "Love. 247 sigh some time afterwards, as if his letters had not told her the plain truth, on this point, as well as on all others. \" You could not have brought back anything better ; you could not have brought back anything I would have liked a thousandth part so well. Oh, I am so glad, Jack ; so thankful to God to have you again !\" Then she asked him if he was tired, for they would be more undisturbed to take a turn up and down for a little while ; it was only foggy, and she was glad of the air ; she had not been out that day before. Some of the guests who were to be pre sent at her Cousin Louisa's marriage to-morrow, were staying at their house, Jack would be very welcome among them, but she would not have him to herself. And the two walked backwards and forwards in the lamplight and the drizzle, under Jack's riddled umbrella, for a blest half hour ; such a half- hour as brides, in brilliant drawing-rooms, behind rosy curtains, with ap proving friends burning incense before them, might now and then covet. During the next few months, if Marjory Bruce had not been invested with that strength and sweet ness which was at her heart's core, and with the principle which ruled them, she would have been torn asunder by rival affections, she would have committed one of two great errors. She would either have given up Jack, and made her peace with her mother, \u2014 and it is a terrible thing for a"], [260, "248 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. good girl to live in strife and wrangling, and sus tain a distressing species of blockade from a mem ber of her kindred, to whom she owes much duty and regard, and in that case she would probably have finished Jack's chances fast ; or else she would have gone off\" to Jack, and rent one of the most sacred relations of life, and endowed Jack with a partner whose defiance of old ties was not very likely to qualify her to preserve, honour, and glorify new. Marjory did neither, and, like most enduring, upright individuals, she procured some standing-ground ; she bore down some opposition. Her mother never forbade Jack the house ; her re lations never interfered actively to compel her to throw him over. Jack tried another office at Blackness ; but, oh, that want of application, what a fatal defect it is in a grown man ! and how hard it is to supplement its absence by late resolution, late adherence to plod ding, painstaking, and dry routine. Jack could not do it yet, with all the inducement of Marjory Bruce's love and faithfulness ; for if a man will not play the man for God's sake and his own, he will scarcely do it for a woman, though she be the apple of his eye. God had been good to Jack, and given him manly, tender impulses ; but Jack had never concentrated and consecrated them by a new life of self-denial and self-devotion, and such a lesson is rarely learned in a day, not even when a man has said his prayers, read his Bible, and gone"], [261, "Love. 249 to church with a single-hearted purpose all the rest of his days. Without this backbone to his virtue, Jack could not go erect either in the sphere which he now occupied, or in any other. Indeed, so far as present prosperity was concerned, Jack would have fared much better, as Mrs. Bruce would have preferred him, without his sense of justice and his geniality. Had he been selfish, grasping, cringeing, he would doubtless have more speedily overcome his volatility, forced his way in the world, and offered Marjory a comfortable, perhaps a magnifi cent home, all in a trice. But if I know Marjory Bruce aright, she would have spurned it at that price. I understand Jack again succumbed to disturbing influences in his career, and hoisted the rover's perpetually-shifting flag, and steered on a bran-new tack, from a quarrel with his master on the right of thinking for himself, and from certain sweeping censures which he saw meet to pass on the prac tices of the firm. \" Nothing to blush for, nothing to degrade him for a second in the opinion of any one whose sentence was worth listening to ; quite the reverse,\" Marjory argued, but she could not hold the argument long. A man cannot touch pitch and not be defiled ; not a poor fellow like Jack Fergusson, giving way for ever to impulse, unsteady, unguarded, at open war with a multitude of his fellow-creatures, no longer the ill-natured gossips alone, but respectable men"], [262, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 250 and women, respectable Pharisees, if you will, but still well-doing, well-disposed people, notwithstand ing some harsh prejudices. Such a one as Jack Fergusson had need of a cohort of angels to defend him from a greater fall ; and Jack did wander into forbidden, miry by-ways, never with a will, never without repulsion, loathing, and remorse. But how long would these sensations serve him ? until the self-respect, he had been unwittingly sapping all his life, was clean gone, until his conscience was seared and hardened. Ah, me ! we will not speak of Marjory Bruce now. Compelled to drink this bitterest cup of a woman's wretchedness, \u2014 the unworthiness of the man she has called her head. Oh, false, frail god ! how you have humbled her, together with yourself, and caused her to bite the very dust, even because she loved you as her own soul ! Marjory had reached what is a wild and mad dening bewilderment to a woman, an enigma which people read in very different ways. I have heard good men maintain, that no woman who has once pledged herself to a man, and accepted his pledge in return, ought to give him up on this side time ; unless, I suppose, he constrain her to be his part ner in sin. I have heard good women protest that a woman should relinquish a man, however dear, on the bridal-eve itself, if she has reason to suspect the purity of his faith and works ; that she should fly, like Lot from Sodom, for her own life, and"], [263, "Love. 251 leave him to perish in the burning city, if he is so infatuated and accursed. I suspect the confusion rights itself. If a man be bad, he outrages the woman to whom he is bound, he casts her off in spirit or in deed ; he does not really want her honest, penetrating, exacting affection. But Mar jory was persuaded that Jack's fitful letters only breathed burning love and sorrow ; that he was a man beside himself, tempted and beset by a devil whom he would yet conquer and trample under his feet. Do not be angry with her, poor girl, for her credulity, because without it I do think that strange thing might have happened to her, \u2014 her heart would have broken. Old Mr. Fergusson died surrounded by luxu ries, and was found to have left no provision for Jack. What provision did a stout son with brains and hands want ? He was a deal better without one. But a man who has brought up his family with extravagant habits, and has never afforded them a single instance of abstinence from pride, vanity, and sensual enjoyment, or of consecration of strength, health, and faculties of body and mind, had better, in common charity, heap up some wealth for his descendants, though it should appear an excess of indulgence. Jack Fergusson had removed to London, that great net which draws in so many provincial fish, and keeps the good and honours them, and throws the bad away \u2014 whither, who can tell ?"], [264, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 252 Then Mrs. Bruce was seized with the last of her many sicknesses. Poor woman ! she was more patient than she had ever shown herself for merly, lying there, shut out from the glare and glamour of life ; it was as if a breath from a region healthier and more generous had blown across her spirit. She would say, as she had never had the self-forgetfulness, or taken the time and thought to do in the old days, to Marjory, \u2014 \u25a0 \" You have had a deal to bear, my dear ; I hope you'll be happy yet.\" Precious words to Marjory. Jack Fergusson came down to the funeral ; and Mrs. Bruce had no more decent, disinterested mourner there, though the dead woman had been no friend to him. In the afternoon, Jack went by himself to see Marjory in her empty house ; begin ning that most forbidding aspect of life to a kindly woman's nature, a single woman's existence. Though Jack was by no means famous for tact, he had a consciousness that he could not continue to go about Marjory Bruce as he had done ; that their connexion must come to an end some time. Subdued as Jack was by the occasion of his visit, by his sensibility to Marjory's grief, and by his painful reflections that he might have been a true son, a veritable prop and stay to \" the woman who was a widow ; \" whom he had helped to lay in the grave, and whose load he had not lightened by one hair's-breadth, if he had not piled additional"], [265, "Love. 253 fagots on her poor, shrunk, bent back, \u2014 the idea pressed upon him. Jack felt as if truly he were not worthy, as if he ought to tell Marjory so, as if he ought to free her from her long obligation to him, and bid her have nothing more to do with him and his ill luck. Barbarous as the blow might be at such a season, better have done with it than live on with it impending over their heads. But when Marjory came down to him from the room where she had been sitting with her aunts, in her black dress, with her dear, beautiful lips pressed together to prevent their quivering ; when she looked at him with such fixed eyes, when he sat alone with her at her hearth, Jack could not dissolve the last tie that bound him to paradise. A great agony of prayer came over him, and he rose and stood before her, and besought her, \u2014 \" Will you try me once again, Marjory ?\" And she got up and walked to his side, and put her arm round his neck. \" Until seventy times seven, Jack.\" I believe a great awe came over Jack at the extent of that woman's faith. I believe that it sobered him, and steeled his light, loveable nature more than anything else he had encountered in the whole course of his life. I believe it gave him his first vivid conception of a matchless forbearance, an infinite love. Jack was able to marry Marjory before her black dress was laid aside. She only put it off for the"], [266, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 254 pale February day, when she became his wife, to resume it the next working-day. That was one ot the grave concomitants of a grave wedding, at a time when there were no flowers save Christmas roses, heavy with moisture and stained with earth soils, and little winking hepaticas. Women are superstitious to the last ; they are averse to such omens ; they will have the sun shine, the flowers bloom, the bells peal, and smiling, fond friends supporting them, caressing them, and wishing them joy. No true woman is indifferent to such accessories ; she regrets their absence ; she misses what should have been of life's gala ; she mourns the friends and favours she has lost ; she turns with such humble, anxious appeal at the last to the uncles and aunts, like the Bruces, who are calling her wilful and stubborn, and bent on her own de struction, to the very chubby maid-servant, who is shaking out her dress, and thinking, \u2014 \" Eh, sirs ! this dull ploy is not like a wedding.\" Yet none can dig up wells among the sulphur pits like women ; none can draw honey in such streams from the flinty rocks. A glimpse of the eager thankfulness which had replaced Jack Fer gusson's old riotous joyfulness made his mistress's faint heart glad.

But I can say that he was like a man awakened from a sleep, and recovered from a fever ; and though he might still feel in a measure helpless, weak, liable to relapses, he mended fairly from that day. He and Marjory worked together, shared their struggles honestly, climbed slowly and staggeringly, but surely, to some degree of indepen dence ; and surprised the Blackness world into admitting that Marjory Bruce's marriage had turned out a very tolerable marriage after all. \" But it was not luck, Marjory,\" Jack said, when they talked over their troubles on rare occasions ; for sound men and women are not fond of reverting to sorrows, far less to sins, unless to gather jealously the precious drops of balm they have shed. \" You ventured gallantly, all in God's grace, for the love of me.\""], [268, ""], [269, "PART II.\u2014 STUDIES. R"], [270, ""], [271, "CHAPTER I. GODLINESS. Among gifts I have reckoned a long list : youth, intellect, beauty, favour, ambition, pleasure, friend ship, love. Some of these may be ours for a time ; some may be, in a great measure, from first to last denied to us ; all may be taken from us. We may have them, or we may want them, and, terrible as the blank appears, we may certainly, in the light of another world, do without them. Of studies I reckon only two. These we must run after, if we are faithful, to our dying day ; these, without re servation, are our actual possessions, ours to foster, develop, mature here ; ours to practise and enjoy hereafter. The first is Godliness. Without some form of Godliness, there can be no sure virtue, no firm principle. All excellence, not built on the foundation of the conception of God, the fear of God, the love of God, is the foolish man's house on the sand \u2014 \" the wind blew, and the storm rose,"], [272, "260 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. and great was the fall of it.\" Even irreligious men and women have a dim, restless, inconsistent per ception of this fact. A woman without God in the world, is an awfully sad and strange spectacle. By woman came sin and death into the world, the seed of the woman bruised the serpent's head, the Lord was born of a woman, women followed His foot steps, women ministered unto Him, women were last at the cross and first at the sepulchre ; and of the Master's exceeding tenderness for women, we have a proof in His own generous, mindful, touch ing speech, even, on the Dolorous way, fainting under His own mighty sorrows and humiliations, \" Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but rather weep for yourselves.\" A woman's heart, unsosiened by that divine love, unmelted by that incomparable sacrifice, \u2014 we repeat it, an unbeliev ing, reckless, crafty, vain, light woman is an aw fully sad and strange spectacle. But just because the livelier feelings and softer tempers of women render them usually more open to impressions, there is the more need that these impressions should not prove flighty, fickle, spu rious, or morbid. To women particularly applies that verse ofthe parable ofthe sower which repre sents the seed sown and germinated, and sprung fresh and fair ; too quick and ready of promise, as it were, without depth of earth, and so when the sun shines, when persecution or tribulation comes, it withers away. Women are liable to be made"], [273, "Godliness. 261 up of impulses ; they require ballast ; even those of them who have comparatively strong, deep natures require discipline, constant discipline, to break and train the rebellious womanly nature. Now, do not mistake me. Godliness is a divine grace. \" No man can come unto God, except the Spirit of God draw him;\" it is a spiritual effort ; they who worship God \" must worship him in spirit and in truth ; \" but, for all that, godliness is a study carried on by human perseverance and action, and the use of material means. Though it is our hearts which we lift to God in prayer, yet we also do Him the homage of the body ; and while we are in the body, with this mysterious double nature of ours, if we deliberately and wil fully lay aside the outward homage, I would dread the non - continuance of the inward reverence. We speak to our Father in heaven in articulate sounds, because these are now the expressions of our living souls. So our godliness must have not only a creed and a ritual, but a regular acknow ledgment in our day. Far be it from me to wish to fetter any free spirit, to dictate a channel of grace, to constrain to a course of duty ; but writ ing to young girls, I would ask them affectionately to keep in mind the good, lowly, wise truth \u2014 \" Little things on little wings, Bear little souls to heaven.\" The act of eating and drinking seems to us a very small, irrelevant, commonplace, contemptible"], [274, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 262 business, and we are often guilty of presumptuously slighting the process ; but it is a serious one, never theless, for it is the source which preserves, or rather restores, the flesh and blood and bones of this mortal framework, in which it has pleased our Creator to place for a season our immortal soul, and which it is certainly not His will that we should destroy before its time. So our god liness must be fed at stated intervals ; it must be refreshed and replaced by fresh aliment ; and although we do not see here the connexion of cause and effect \u2014 though the first may often, to our grief, be distasteful to us, as our natural food in ailing states of the body, though it must always have its formal character \u2014 we must humbly and perse veringly con our day's lessons, and strive to win from them their germ of pure vitality. I love the word Lesson, which the Episcopal Church gives to the morning and evening readings of its people. I have read the advices of good men on many kinds of daily spiritual diet, and have been honestly struck, again and again, sometimes with their im practicability, sometimes with their austerity, some times with their spasmodic vehemence, but I have never doubted that they contained their own in destructible seeds of excellence ; indeed, that no excellence could well exist without them.

I have heard a preacher speak of the sense of contentment and security which a man or woman experiences after he or she has said his or her prayers, as if it were about the most worldly, hardened, and hopeless state of mind. What would they have ? Are we not to say our prayers ? Are we not to search the Scrip tures ? And can there be a more becoming, reason able, reverent period for these exercises than in our mornings and evenings ? And does not our recon ciled Father, who knows the exigencies of our con stitutions and has bestowed their instincts, himself allow us this sense of happiness in a void supplied, an obligation fulfilled ? Will He thus despise His children when they \" feel after Him,\" gropingly, still loyal in their darkness and dullness ? And will He not rather bless them, and give them more and more light ?

That is, think of it as a blessing, a consolation, a direction, and a support ; be unassuming and unexacting ; look for teaching from the Spirit of all wisdom ; take up your own private interpretation in a lowly, liberal temper ; beware of judging your neighbour whom you fancy careless in her devotions ; be not brow beaten by your other neighbour who, independent, mystical, or bigoted, censures you as at once childish and bold in your safeguard and in your freedom. Trust grace, sure in its promise, no less sure in its performance, and read your Bible, wish ing and. striving to do its behests. Look upon it as your storehouse and your armoury, and when times of \" refreshing,\" or of trial, of life and work,"], [277, "Godliness. 265 or of decay and death, arrive, do not question but it will supply you with a share of victuals and weapons. Try the practice sincerely, unassum ingly, and lovingly, and you may perhaps marvel at its power. Prayer is so lofty a subject, so private and in tensely personal an interest, that a writer, who is not a commissioned servant of the Lord, may well shrink from intruding an opinion on her fellows on a matter which is between them and their Maker. And yet who can dwell on godliness, and from delicate scruples omit the mention of prayer ? After the Divine model of prayer, see that you pray your own prayer, and no other man or woman's ; and consider the two invaluable suggestions you have received \u2014 that your prayers are to be still and secluded communions, and that they are not to be heard for their much speaking. Let them be very real prayers, cries for help, grateful thanks, adoring praise. Our Father in heaven, your Father and mine, as well as the Almighty God of the universe, will not be impatient of our little, fretting troubles, our trifling attainments, our feeble, faltering worship. He who cares for the sparrows and the ravens will heed the aching or the bounding heart. He will have our own words and not another's ; our own pleadings, wrestlings, and rejoicings, rather than the experience of even a David or a Moses second-hand. Blessed be His name ! He does care for our struggles and"], [278, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 266 our victories, our weal and our woe ; and our Elder Brother cannot, either on earth or in heaven, lose his fellow-feeling, his entire and exquisite sympathy with his race. After the reading of the Bible and prayer, and keeping that day in seven, which is given us to float as far as we can from worldliness, self ishness, and malice, and as near as we can to adoration, peace, and love, I believe that any other aim to this end of godliness is minor and relative. I take it for granted that no honest, good girl will wilfully and deliberately commit a known sin, how ever often, alas ! she may stumble and fall un awares in her career. What is not in itself sinful, is so far lawful. No doubt all that is lawful is not expedient. An apostle has said so, and we are bound to try to be enlightened on this expedi ency, with regard to our own welfare, and, above all, for our neighbour's sake, because the question of expediency seems to refer principally to our influence over our neighbour. But I think, gene rally, whatever is lawful is not only allowable, but under due limits and proportions beneficial. I do not agree with those who would introduce a system of monachism into our social life, who regard God's world as the wicked world, God's kingdom of art as the devil's kingdom, and the deep, tender affections which our great Father has implanted in our bosoms as so many cords of idolatry. I would be a ransomed woman, and then,"], [279, "Godliness. 267 while performing the work which has been given to me to do, I would not fear to relish all the comforts, pleasures, and joys which He has set in my path ; believing that God is well pleased with our contentment and gladness, that he asks and accepts the praise and thanks of our merry hearts, as well as the confessions and petitions of our mourning spirits. The church, in my heart, should have its festivals as well as its fasts. Thus, as minor and relative, would I regard all other religious reading after the study of the Bible. At the same time, I think a girl in earnest about godliness will have her eye on its promotion in some part of her general reading. I would re commend her in this search, as an advice which cannot be repeated too often (so much are we tempted to adopt a parrot-like imitation of each other), to read what she feels applies to herself and profits herself. Not to insist on drugging herself with another person's medicine, too strong, or it may be too weak, or otherwise totally un suited to her constitution and ailment. While frankly taking what God in his Provi dence sends, and joining in the toil and the recrea tion of the work-a-day and holiday world, many good people are distressed by a sense of disruption be tween their spiritual and their natural life. Arnold, I think, expressed such a keen consciousness when leaving the bed-side of a dying boy to begin one of his classes ; and afterwards he commenced his"], [280, "268 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. lecture or examination with prayer. Probably nothing but experience, growth in Christianity weaned from selfishness, and a higher, closer, and clearer comprehension of, and communion with the Divine life (what George Wilson meant when he wrote \" The meaning of Life, the pur pose of God, the worth of this world and the next, have all risen into a prominence which they had not formerly displayed\") will overcome this discord. John Wesley recommended short ejaculatory prayers, if no more than \" the Lord direct me ! \" \"the Lord help me !\" and this corresponds lite rally with the apostle's \" pray without ceasing,\" \" be instant in prayer.\" Others have chosen a verse in the morning, to be, as it were, blended and intertwined with their day's occupations and enjoyments, so as to leaven them throughout. Certainly, when prone to covetousness, the ad monition, \" let your treasure be in heaven ; \" when driven to unrest, the meditation on the peace which was His bequest ; when entangled in ambitious effort, and its accompanying strife, the recommendation not to desire vain-glory, ought to be aids to us. Another habit, whose acquisition is frequently pressed upon us, is to review at night our day's transactions, and humbly acknowledge their success while we lament their failures, in order to have our conscience always clean, and in working order. To this has been added the glancing over, in the morning, a rough plan of what the day's"], [281, "Godliness. 269 duties, trials, temptations, pleasures, pains may be, with the intent of a consequent preparation for them ; guarding, at the same time, lest this should interfere with taking no heed for the morrow, and casting our cares on One who careth for us. But, let me reiterate, these are minor and relative obligations, and must always depend very much on the temperament, condition, and surroundings of the individual concerned. They may be easily erected into eleventh commandments, and twisted into will-worship and bodily exercise. If held tenaciously, doggedly, in a spirit of self-conceit, fussiness, or intolerance, they may not only be very injurious to the girl and woman relying on them, but to all those with whom she comes in contact, causing false inferences, unjust judgments, and inflicting grave wounds in the broad humanity ofthe gospel. I cannot find, that in the wide or concentrated laws ofthe Bible, there are any express injunctions to formal acts in the promotion of godliness beyond \" search the Scriptures ;\" \" be instant in prayer ;\" \" forsake not the assembling of yourselves to gether;\" \"do good and communicate.\" The mantle is a wide one ; preserve its simple integrity, and its folds will fit the shape of youth and age, rich and poor, those whom the north gives up, and those whom the south keeps not back.

I cannot comprehend it.\" The speaker was an old man in hodden grey ; a stiff, consequential, old working man, with the long upper lip, the long rabbit teeth, the long head, the long terrier back (though it was rounded now with years and labour), of a sagacious but opinion ative old servant ofthe public. \" How can ye thole it, Miss Viol ? I cannot comprehend it.\" The speech was out of keeping with the decided, or, as he would have called it, preceese character of Geordie, the gardener of the old-world town of Hatton, who managed his own little garden, and its cauliflowers and codlins, to his own mind, and domineered over the gardens of his employers from seed-time till harvest. The speech was not in his usual style, and the look was not the ordinary look of the egotistical, positive old man ; it was a softened, pitiful look from an in ferior to a superior long known and respected, not for her glories but her tribulations. Miss Viol was a big, gaunt woman, in brown drapery, with a tight look about her costume, as if she could not be cumbered with loose folds. Her face was raw-boned, as well as her figure, and her grey hair, dry and bristling, corresponded with its harsh outline. She had Geordie's long upper lip ;"], [283, "Godliness. 271 but, in Miss Viol's case, it did not convey the idea of the utmost limits of human confidence ; it had no more than the sagacity which is inalienable from a long upper lip, and so far from being self-assured it had a nervous twitch which betrayed a conscien tious, tender disposition. Indeed, Miss Viol was not only wise in her generation, but so soft-hearted and soft - tempered with her thoughtfulness, that how she parried the strokes of destiny, maintained her single combat with fortune, and held on her tem pestuous career, was a standing miracle at Hatton. Miss Viol did not take it ill that old Geordie, whom she was hiring to \" dibble kale \" and \" sheuch leeks,\" should allude to her misery. It was too widely and intimately known for her to be concerned to conceal it ; and, perhaps, that was the one rent of relief in the black clouds through which Miss Viol passed in her life-voyage, like the moon on a stormy night. Neither did Miss Viol refuse commiseration from Geordie ; she was too meek a woman for that, and too set apart, as it were, and compelled, like the Ancient Mariner, to ask commiseration from all humanity. \" I dinna ken, Geordie,\" answered Miss Viol, in her uncouth phraseology, with the slow, thick articulation of a woman who speaks seldom, \" unless it be by prayer and fasting \u2014 fasting from thoughts of self, and what might have been. Ye ken the very worst description of deevils could not abide prayer and fasting.\""], [284, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 272 Miss Viol was the eldest daughter of the saddler of Hatton ; the man who occupied the corner house, with the dingy, stucco horse capering above his door ; a man who lived when saddlers drove a brisker trade than they do now-a-days, and when their peculiar traffic brought them much in contact with rough country lairds and farmers. It was an age, moreover, when a boon companion was prized as a treasure, or rather snared as a prey ; and when Adam Forsyth was young, he was no more like Miss Viol, than a starling is like an owl. He was a merry, ready-witted man, careless in his habits, and coarse in his feelings, but not more so than many another bon-vivant in high or low life ; his full, flexible lips were constantly curving in broad mimicry, and meeting together with comical force in rich suggestions. Miss Viol did not resemble him in the least ; she took after her mother, who minded the shop, strove to rear her children and attend to her husband, and, worn and weary, dropped into her grave half-a-score of years before. Miss Viol stepped conveniently into her mother's shoes, young as she then was ; received orders in her father's frequent absences, kept accounts, en deavoured quite ineffectually to control the thought less apprentices, spent long days stitching at ladies' saddles, executing all kinds of artistic checkers in white silk on the stuffed leather. The sight of our mothers' side-saddles will always remind me of Miss Viol, for that was the only fancy work she"], [285, "Godliness. 273 ever knew, and she had a fond pride in her exploits; and for rest she had the training of the younger children \u2014 a set of girls who, one after another, grew up the \" marrow \" of their father, with high animal spirits, strong passions, and very slender organs of veneration, justice, and benevolence. Not ten Miss Viols could have curbed these high heads, and held in these hard mouths. Miss Viol was now known as the middle-aged, long-suffering daughter of the tippling, boozing saddler of Hatton, with his light, younger lasses. Her charge was to defend the father from the re sults of his gross and inveterate intemperance, and to save the girls from vice and ruin ; and night and day Miss Viol laboured at a task fit to be com pared with that of Sisyphus. Night and day she guarded the reckless, scoffing sisters ; morning after morning she sustained her father in his stupefac tion ; night after night she bore with him in his mad ness. Miss Viol was never absent from her post. That dark, mean parlour, with its grey drugget, its tawdry girls' finery, its silver plates and stirrups, and leather peaks and flaps, saw a sacrifice noble as Iphigenia's, a tragedy sad as Lear's ; not a death by the knife, sharp yet swift, but a long anguish of dislike, apprehension, disgust, horror ; not one instance of expulsion, cruel, and monstrous, but a slow torture of rejection as friend and counsellor, and bare sufferance as servant and slave. And Miss Viol was a timid, prejudiced woman, who s"], [286, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 274 screamed at a mouse and ran from a cow ! She bore it ; the pure, mild woman lived on in the foul atmosphere of vanity and sin, never relaxing her efforts, never relinquishing her hope. \" If I could but weather the wind with the light-headed lasses, and see them safely married off my hand ; though their men were puir men and dour men, I would not mind ; they need their masters : if I could but see my father take to hamelier, cannier ways, I would not grudge the warstle with their tempers. I'm sure they're welcome to a' my aught ; they're well entitled to the best of me.\" And Miss Viol stood by her colours while the vessel reeled and the shot rattled, and she would have gone down with them without a dream of desertion. Miss Viol was not only stanch, she was tran quil in her great trouble; as she said, she prayed and fasted ; she fasted from self, and she prayed directly towards God's mercy-seat without doubt or distraction. She was grieved by the mystery of iniquity ; but it did not shake her living faith ; she read her Bible as another eats strong meat and drinks strong drink for nourishment and stimulant ; and on this diet, like the prophet, after he had tasted angels' food, she travelled many a day in the waste, howling wilderness. I have used one simile with regard to Miss Viol so appropriate that I cannot forsake it for another. The moon rides securely among drift ing, tempest-tost clouds, wan and yet steadfast,"], [287, "Godliness. 275 soft and yet clear, so Miss Viol knew adver sity. I will say it for the rude little town of Hatton, it viewed Miss Viol like a planet in the sky ; it surrounded her with a broad halo of respect and goodwill ; not that she understood it \u2014 she received their pity, but their praise would have scared her. Still you might have sought up and down, far and near, and not found a lady in the land more truly hon oured than that plain, awkward, uninformed woman. Night after night, in the long dewy evenings of summer \u2014 the bitter, black nights of winter, Miss Viol sat nodding, until the small hours, over her feminine saddlery, or stumbled down the steep, narrow stair, to let in the sisters gadding from house tohouse, gossiping at street-doors, returning to break the silence ofthe \"hushed, holy night\" with their loud, defiant laughter ; and again, when the morning-star was dying in the sky before the pearly white of the rising day, the same shuffling, spent foot crept out to admit a very beast into the house. Woe is me ! it was like an imprisoned angel dwell ing with and ministering to Pan and his satyrs. More furiously boiled and bubbled the fer ment and scum of the circumstances among which Miss Viol's lot was cast. Sister after sister whirled on the verge of the precipice, until their remaining atop, and not being dashed to pieces on the stones below, might have puzzled sages, had they condescended to study such paltry proba-"], [288, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 276 bilities. Adam Forsyth became so fatuous at one time, so frenzied at another, that it was a question of the safety of himself and his fellows, whether he should belefthis own master. Cool strong men shud dered when they thought of him raging loose, during long nights, in a household of defenceless women. \" Na,\" explained Miss Viol, when she was examined on the point, \" I dinna trust Mysie and Ailie and Jean and Kirsty within his reach ; I send them quietly to their beds, and I lock the room door when he happens to be very wild, and I 've to sit up and bear him company.\" \" And what, in the name of mercy, do you do yourself, Miss Viol?\" \" I'm not feared ; I say, ' Father, you maun be quiet,' or, ' Father, you would not hurt me,' and he leaves off what he's about; and I read to him, or he reads to me \u2014 he was aye proud of his reading \u2014 and though he forgets the place, he does not misca' the words. Na, you maun confide my father to me, others might be rough with him, and he would not survive the shame of being confined. You mauna even him to that. Trust him to me, and he '11 do no harm, and you'll never rue it.\" It was in sheer regard for Miss Viol, because her heart was set on preserving her father's liberty, and on continuing his keeper, and because she impressed them with the singular weapon of her serenity, that the men granted her request. \" My dawties,\" Miss Viol would coax the in-"], [289, "Godliness. 277 sensate sisters, \"if you'll no gang that gate the nicht, I'll put on my Leghorn and my Paisley shawl, and walk with you mysel' another road the morn's nicht.

I might stay in the shop, that's the place for me, the place I'm fondest of, did you say?\" Miss Viol had a habit of repeating her neighbours' sentences, trying to catch the sense and sound, which they did not trouble themselves to make plain to her, since, in the midst of her drudgery, the sense of hearing had prematurely failed her. \" Surely you would not have me set you lasses in my room, it is liker a grey-headed woman, sic as me, than awheen daffin' lasses, sic as you ; though, I think, I did not daff when I was not grey-headed.

It is hard to say what good Miss Viol effected in her ill-conditioned, rebel rout of a family ; but I can vouch she established such a standard of virtue in Hatton as is rarely excelled. In the way of example, that noblest preacher, Miss Viol was a notable missionary. There comes a period to human wrong and sorrow. Adam Forsyth died in one of his fits of delirium, and Miss Viol wiped away her scalding tears. \" It is the will of the Father,\" she whispered. \" I dare not speak up against Him. Poor father ! I maun commit him to the Father.\" Even that last awful dispensation could not cast Miss Viol from her rock. The head gone, the disorderly family sprung asunder in all directions, like beads when the string is snapped. Miss Viol had no longer the power, though she had the will, to preserve the elements of disunion in unity. Some of the girls amended their errors in after life, and came to better ends than had been expected of them, for God is merciful, and the ways of His grace are mani fold ; to them Miss Viol would point with the most disinterested, the purest love and thankful ness. Others went swiftly to the lowest depths of degradation, and them Miss Viol relieved to the"], [291, "Godliness. 279 last out of her own pittance, weeping tears of pity over them, and still hoping against hope in their reformation, when they thought no shame to come begging from her, and robbing her on whom they had preyed all their days. But Miss Viol was free ; free to occupy a peace ful, orderly home ; free to maintain herself decently by her curious saddlery. That single woman's life, so desolate to many a bereaved woman, was \" biggit was\" of safety, contentment, and abundance to Miss Viol. Her Book, her saddlery, her tea-pot, her cat, her geraniums, her friends, who claimed her now in kindly bands, were all her own. Miss Viol said wonderingly in her modesty, \" The warld was ower gude to her ; she had lived long in it, and never kenned it liked her so well ; she had done nothing for it, her hand had been taken up with her own folk.\" Miss Viol could not comprehend why the world should \" fash\" with her ; and had it not been for her good-nature, she would have been affronted by its courtship. \" And you'll no need to be so thrang v/ith your reading and your prayers now, Miss Viol,\" sug gested Geordie, as he came across with a basket of his potatoes, his own finest kidneys, to present to her. Geordie's question was projected, not from idle curiosity, but to solve some doubt deep down in his own heart. I am sorry to say Geordie was suspected of heresy ; at the same time, my private opinion always tended to this point, that Geordie's"], [292, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 280 theological eccentricities proceeded from a certjin thrawnness inherent in Geordie's constitution, which impelled him to sow peas broadways in stead of lengthways, and to switch trailing roses, in defiance of the remonstrances of their owners. My idea was that the more you meddled with Geordie, the more rootedly heretical he grew, and that, therefore, the less notice you took of his heresy the better. Miss Viol never interfered with theories ; I doubt if she had any shapely theory of her own, and therefore Geordie had recourse to her in some long-standing perplexity. \" Na, Geordie, ye're wrang,\" explained Miss Viol, so unhesitatingly but unpretendingly, that Geordie submitted to be told he was wrong, like \u2014 like a man. \" I thocht for a while, like you, that my verses, and my psalms, and my petitions, and all but my praises might be laid by for the rest of my life, while I worked, and walked about, and pleased myself; but soon everything grew dreich and dreary, and my life was not what I hoped it would have been ; my hearth-stane was not so cheery, the very honey-suckles, and cockroses, and butterflies were not so sweet and bright as I ex pected, now that I had time to daunder by the hedges and loanings, and take a good look at them.

KINDLINESS. Godliness without kindliness I believe to be a delusion, and, like all delusions affecting religion, baneful both to those who are blinded and to those who are revolted by the mutilation. \" He who loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?\" is a ques tion which admits of no exception. As there is no sound, enduring kindliness without godliness, there is no godliness without kindliness. Kindli ness is an integral part of godliness : \" pure religion and undefiled is to visit the widow and the father less in their affliction, and to keep one's-self un spotted from the world.\" In one sense kindliness must also be a work of God's grace ; but like godliness itself, it is to be nourished, strengthened, ripened by human energy and constancy exerted on means. Kind liness must be a study to a good girl. But, in AbA"], [295, "Kindliness. 283 case of misconception, understand kindliness as good-will, benevolence, mindfulness, and mercy, which may exist in company with plainness, stiffness, starchedness, seriousness, and even an exterior\" of sternness, and which is quite irre spective of a soft temper and a caressing address. It is curious, and a little vexatious to find how matter and manner are confounded ; how so many honeyed words from a plausible, crafty woman, and so many sharp ones from a true and tender one, keenly alive to wrong-doing, are carelessly allowed to reverse the world's estimation of their character, and are received even by those who ought to know better, as correct indices of the individuals. . This sweetness of manner is so notorious a var nish, as to become the butt of the corroding acids and scraping-knives of many of our writers of fic tion. Nowhere is it more extensively displayed than in the inordinate love of children and chil dren's society affected by some of the women of our day; and in the exaggerated estimation of childish worth displayed largely in some depart ments of the world of letters. Because our Mas ter taught us to reverence little children by remind ing us that their helplessness and ignorance of fraud and violence, rendered them, and all who are like them, especially the charge of His Father's angels, one-half of the world professes to regard these little people as angels outright. This extravagance has even been pushed, in the face of a thousand exam-"], [296, "284 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. pies of childish meanness and tyranny, to the daring extent of a denial of original sin. It strikes me that this foolish notion of which men and women are so proud is but a rag of spurious humility, for you see it is actually easier for your arrogance and headiness, your sloth and obstinacy, your desperate covetousness and turbulence to bow, half scepti cally, half laughingly, to a child's sceptre of rushes, than to pay a modest and womanly homage to a man's truncheon. Kindliness, then, never consisted or even lay to any extent in \" becks and bows, and wreathed smiles,\" though real pleasantness is a great element in winning the favour of our fellows. Neither is it by any means engrossed or fully expressed by almsdeeds, though without question, if we do feel tenderly to our neighbour at all, we feel with pecu liar tenderness to our neighbour in any suffering and wretchedness which we can comprehend. \" Though I give all my goods to feed the poor and have not charity, I am nothing.\" This kindliness is charity, liberality and generosity of spirit, fairness and impartiality of judgment, mildness and meek ness of heart rather than of tone, kindly affection ateness in all ties and relations \u2014 tenderest in the nearest, mellow and sympathetic in the most re moved.

I would urge it the more imperatively that it is (but certainly by no means to the same extent as formerly) overlooked, or understated, or in some respect slurred over in many papers to young people. Kindliness is only second to godliness. On one occasion the apostle accorded it the precedence ; \" If we do not love the brother whom we have seen, how can we love him,\" in whose glorious image that brother was originally created, the \" God whom we have not seen ?\" On woman, by natural constitution and time out-of-mind institutions, kindliness is so imperative, that the want of it brings down express scandal on godly women, or rather on women professing god liness. I need not allude to the satires, deserved and undeserved, by some of the strangely neutral, some of the still more strangely and sadly antago nistic, and some of the merely smart and pungent writers of the day. This defect is generally seen where our very instincts should have pointed out to us the flagrant outrage, by our own hearths, and in our own homes. Domestic duties, always holy and dear, are often monotonous \u2014 have often their wearing irritations and carking cares ; they are unseasoned by excitement ; they claim no renown. The self-sacrifice they involve, although it is often very complete, is so subtle, that it becomes no cause of pride ; in fact, it is made almost inad vertently and insensibly. Therefore stragglers and"], [298, "286 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. adventurers are won from these still, shady, simple paths by vanity, by the restlessness of craving, un employed energies, and also to do them justice by a mistaken sense of duty. To enter upon public services, they desert their private posts, and they are thus guilty of a double infidelity ; they have forsaken their first love ; and by taking upon them engagements for which they were not free, they have also done despite to and brought shame upon what was in itself fair and honourable, pure and lovely, and of good report. This evil is so very grave, that it needs the strongest protest against its existence and recurrence. But, on the other hand, to those who are disposed to insist on \"busy-bodies,\" \" showy professors,\" \"ill-ordered, ill-balanced enthusiasts,\" we would state respect fully and good-humouredly that it is the scum and froth of the pot which rises to the surface ; that the sound hearts and true, the deep hearts and tender, the sensible, practical women, the cheery, patient women, the constant, untiring, unassuming asserters and maintainers of righteousness and love, work everywhere unseen, unheard of, until the day shall declare it. And our generation has proved sufficiently that great deeds of mercy can be done by women, whose household names have never been spoken without a blessing. Kindliness is thoroughly opposed to meanness, to malice, to mischief of every description. It bids us have faith in one another ; it bids us bear"], [299, "Kindliness. 287 long with one another ; it tells us to be obedient, respectful, and tender to our elders ; firm and yet indulgent to our juniors ; reasonable and gracious to our equals ; just, thoughtful, feeling, and helpful to our inferiors.

There were chests of drawers along the sides of the room, in company with the chairs, and very handy they were, without question. In the window was a mass of house-flowers, myrtles, scented, flowering, one of them red and white, with wax-like blossoms, still more wax-like balsams, roses, and a trellis of vines erected over the whole, and converting the window into a bower. Very pretty ; and what was better in itself, wholesome, though it involved a very unwholesome practice. In your ear, reader, that window was not open for above ten minutes at a time from September till May. How could it be, with that gay garden of southern flowers within, and the frozen snows of the north with out ? Well for the uncalculating inmates, that the plants deodorized faithfully, and without"], [301, "Kindliness. 289 making any fuss about it. The human plants could have stood more than a breath or two of the keen, cutting air ; did encounter it freely to go to Sunday sermons and prayers, to the weekly ball, to visiting, shopping, and marketing; but their nurs lings, the bower of Italian flowers, would have withered under the full touch of the ice-king's fingers. There was a stove in the room, keeping up its heat to the temperature of a comfortable oven. A man was standing playing on a piano ; in short, it was Germany, and not England. \" If little Peter gets up the hymn for Christmas, I'll give him a Niirnberg egg off the tree; we're northern birds, but we can furnish such eggs once upon a time,\" said the musician, in a loud, rich, joyous voice, addressing a girl who entered the room, and sat down in the bower in the window. Before I give the girl's answer, I should like to introduce the father and daughter to you. He was Herr Wilhelm K\u0153nig, general merchant in the northern town of Schneehaufen. He was not an idealized German ; he was big, sanguine (with a wreath of ruddy-brown hair round his mouth and down to his throat), hilarious, hearty ; I daresay he could be determined when he liked, but he was mostly jovial, \u2014 the prince of good-fellows, \u2014 with curls, scarcely tinged with grey, clustering round his very square forehead, and with square white teeth, which he was perpetually showing. He was an ardent, vivacious fellow, with a quick perception of t"], [302, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 290 the ludicrous ; he was tolerably vain, thought no body had improved his musical education (on which he set more store than on his trade and custom) as he had done on small advantages ; had a high estimation of his own overtures, and some times decried other people's quite openly \u2014 but withal it was a brave, bluff, honest vanity, and it was by no means so encroaching that he saw no merit in others. It may give you the most correct idea of Herr K\u0153nig to inform you that he was called in Schneehaufen Willy K\u0153nig (only that they pronounced the diminutive Villee), just as he would have been here. Great slashing, dashing, laughing Willy K\u0153nig ! He was counted very stunning in musical performances, at military marches and mazurkas, and anything requiring fire and brilliance ; but it was a characteristic feature of Herr Willy that his own private impression was, that his forte lay in masses, just as Sir Joshua always imagined himself a faithful disciple of Michael Angelo. I have taken it into my head that you will begin by undervaluing Herr Willy, and that you would take less and less to him if you ever got a glimpse of him playing at games and dancing the cotillon ; but I have a kindness for him when I think how poor he was, and yet -how light-hearted, how re verent in his own continental fashion, how patient he was with his cross wife, how kind to his ten children. Really, he had little comfort in any of"], [303, "Kindliness. 291 them, except in that dreamy, delicate Bertha ; but he was as fond of them as Bess of her litter of puppies, and what pleasure they can be to Bess she only knows. Herr K\u0153nig's were not bad children positively ; but life had been such a scramble to them, they had been so pushed out in the world, and knocked about ere any of the ten reached his or her tenth year, that they very soon began to look after themselves, and took in dividual twists, and were anything but pliant and graceful. Happily they were hardy, which was of more importance ; but little Albrecht in the toy shop, and Hans in the druggist's, and Fritz with his uncle at the farm, were far too much engrossed with their toys, drugs, cattle and sheep, and their play, when they had a moment's liberty, to have any sympathy or attention to spare for their father. They only went to him in their scrapes, and, on far fewer occasions, in their successes. Even little Peter, the musician, did not seek to have much com panionship with his father, beyond the necessary instruction from him. Was not Peter himself already in the choir, and a miniature bugler in the Schneehaufen band ; and was he not already eagerly counting his pay, and anticipating his flight as a true German travelling-apprentice, to pass in succession through the great music-houses of Leipsic, Berlin, Vienna ? The same was the case with the girls ; Thekla and Elise in a worsted shop ; Agatha assist ing her aunt in the great inn of Schneehaufen, the inn"], [304, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 292 with the sign of the three golden crowns, borrowed from Rheinland and Cologne ; even baby Rica was more engrossed with her anxiety about her milk-sops and her sugar-balls, than her father's kisses. Am I describing a very selfish family ? Only little hearts that had too soon had their bloom rubbed off them; little hands too soon taught to wield the tools of labour independent of their parents. The brood had love for each other, but they were so busy they were only able to bring it forth on great occasions. Madam K\u0153nig was also not a bad woman. Herr K\u0153nig was persuaded, correctly, that she had been a good wife to him, but she was dreadfully worried and she was dreadfully cross. She could not alto gether help it, I conclude, for she was a little woman, with the delicacy of constitution which Bertha had inherited ; and the superhuman energy which enabled her to overcome her weakness, and do her duty of foraging for her numerous descend ants was likely to engender acidity. A needle will prick you and draw blood, as well as sew up your seams. Madam K\u0153nig was like a needle, sharp, clear, keen ; her little figure meagre, her once fair complexion grey ; her blue eyes, sapphire eyes originally, steel-blue eyes now. Yes, Herr K\u0153nig met with little indulgence in his own household, save from Bertha, and Bertha held little communication beyond commands, re quests, and gossip, with any member of the family except her father. Altogether, the K\u0153nigs' was"], [305, "Kindliness. 293 not a relaxing home. It was too bracing, for that matter, dangerous for stinting and blighting all the flowers of the mind, every flower of fancy and feel ing, sparing only those material flowers in the bower in the family room. Bertha K\u0153nig was an idealized German ; she was not one of those stout little German girls whom we see so often and shake hands with so freely ; who bake and sew, and dance and chatter fearlessly with the very coffee-sisters, and are in their element in the tea-gardens ; she was what grows up at their side, a waxen-natured girl, like her own balsams, delicate, refined, with a tendency to visionariness, good and true, but abstracted, and, to a certain ex tent, impractical, \u2014 what Caroline Perthes was in her maiden days. Bertha was intellectual, and, happily for herself, she had not confined herself to Goethe and Schiller. Klopstock and the old Ger man hymns had moved her inmost spirit. Such a nature was sadly out of keeping in the K\u0153nigs' house, yet it was developed there, and though it pined, no great violence had wounded or slain it. Madam K\u0153nig took care of that. Bertha was the delicate child, and notwithstanding her mother thought her far too fanciful for this world, and too studious for a woman, and sadly indifferent and languid for one who should one day aspire to be an expert housekeeper, she was too good a mother to do more than speak sharply to Bertha herself, and rout every one else who interfered with her."], [306, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 294 I cannot say that there was any likeness between Bertha and Herr K\u0153nig. He was the impersona tion of a brave sensuous nature. She dwelt in the spirit-world very much apart from life, the earth and its concerns, both enjoyments and pains. But Herr K\u0153nig, though a hard-working man, had the most leisure in the family, and he was infinitely better-humoured than Madam K\u0153nig; so Bertha and Herr K\u0153nig drew together. It must be mentioned here that Bertha's great wish at this time \u2014 and it amounted almost to a passion with the girl \u2014 was to go and stay for a season with her uncle, Pastor Muller, in one of the great towns. Bertha had once visited him for a day, and that glimpse had been enough ; a liberal, poetic, and pious theologian, such as Germany to her honour often rears, kindred wife, kindred chil dren, kindred friends ; the very house breathing an atmosphere of noble thought, playful fancy, and generous, constant benevolence ! Her cousin Rudolph, the holder of the prize-medal of his town, the author of verses which Bertha never said to herself in the moonlight alone in the girls' room, when the other girls were singing and talk ing and entertaining their companions down stairs, without trembling and crying in an ecstasy of ad miration, \u2014 how Bertha would like to see and know her cousin Rudolph ! the blush rose-colour came to her cheek at the mere thought of it. Her cousin Hedwig, who was first pupil at the Conser-"], [307, "Kindliness. 295 vatoire, and had played to the Princess, and caused Bertha's father to pull his beard and go off into extravagances whenever he spoke of her ! \u2014 if Herr Willy could have been jealous, it would have been on account of a daughter like Hedwig Muller to perform his marches and mazurkas, and inspire his long-coming masses. Little Peter was all very well ; little Peter had a fine sense of tune, and if he proved diligent and obedient might make some thing of the cornet or the violoncello ; but he would never play the piano like Hedwig Muller. Hed wig Muller was inspired with the very soul of harmonv ; and what would not her cousin Bertha give to be submitted to the charm of her art, to be swayed like the pine-branches by the wind, to yield up her haunting melancholy, like the gloom of King Saul under the harping of the harper David ? Then how good all the Miillers were, how they thought for others, planned for others, worked for others ! No wretched slavery to the means of liv ing, no engrossing interest in the disposal of such limited profits as those gained by Herr K\u0153nig, no grasping at every advantage, and haggling over the expenditure of every penny. When there were to be relaxation and gratification, the K\u0153nigs selected of the most worldly and selfish kinds ; the shooting-gallery for the boys, the ribbons to trim afresh the girls' old gowns \u2014 the whole gene rally culminating in the Wednesday's bail, the sports, and the promenade to the Schneehaufen-"], [308, "296 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. band of a Sunday afternoon. Bertha longed to see all this reversed. There had been some overtures made by the Miillers to have their retiring, sensitive cousin Bertha with them for Christmas or Easter, and on the decision of those proposals, Bertha hung as on a question of life and death. But it was still two months to Christmas, and it was an instance of Herr K\u0153nig's forward sanguineness that he was already disposing of gifts from the tree ; and such a plump, substantial gift as a Niirnberg egg or watch, unless he meant one with a painted dial and painted hands, for ever motionless \u2014 unless he proposed to make over his own watch to Peter, and go without one, \u2014 he who was always forgetting the time ! \u2014 Bertha could not tell how her father would fulfil his promise. I am afraid Herr Willy promised sometimes without the action following the words ; well, the intention was the next best thing to the performance. With Christmas two months before them, and Herr Willy's intention altogether problematical, out and out impossible, if it reached Madam K\u0153nig's ears, Bertha yet opposed it, and raised her voice in protest ; not loudly or disrespectfully, for Bertha was gentle to a degree, and if her eyes were open to the stolidity and shallowness of others, they were doubly open to her own weakness, and lamentable shortcomings and blunders ; but lifting the cudgels like a good little pure-minded, high-"], [309, "Kindliness. 297 hearted, scrupulous knight-errant, a Red-Cross Knight it must have been, like him who rode forth on the first day's adventures from the fairy queen's footstool. \" Father, is it not bribing Peter to do his duty thus to hire him to application, in a hymn too, by a glittering toy of a watch ?\" \"What would you have, my daughter?\" an swered Herr K\u0153nig with animation, but without irritation ; he was passionate at times, never peevish. \" The little fellow must have his reward. In dustry has its reward. Did you never study that fine maxim, Bertha ?\" \" It is a beggarly maxim, father, in so far as it answers to the jingle of coin, the glitter of jewels, or the rank of a court place,\" responded Bertha, firing up. \" What do you expect him to be but covetous, envious, perhaps dishonest, if you teach him, that for a certain amount of exertion and submission, it is his right to get a certain worldly prize, a watch, or a gun, or even a holi day in the forest ? \" Herr K\u0153nig uttered in German an exclamation equivalent to \"bosh!\" and continued, vehe mently, though still in the most perfect good humour, \u2014 \" The boy must have a reward to encourage him to perseverance ; he is not fit to understand any reward but such as I offer ; when he is older he may distinguish between honour and gain, between"], [310, "298 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. what is moral and what is material. I leave that time to take care of itself.\" \" But, father, is this training Peter to be an evangelist, a saint, a martyr ?\" \" Bless the child ! I don't presume to want Peter to be an evangelist, or saint, or martyr, un less as the good Lord will have him so. I want him to be a good citizen ; I can aid him so far, and that is my business ;\" and Herr K\u0153nig stamped out of the room, but still not in dudgeon, rather relishing an argument with Bertha. What was play to him was, if not death, at least great pain to Bertha. Why should they all be so prosaic, their minds and hearts so much of the earth, earthy ? And why should they spoil Peter, or any young boy, by offering a bait to greediness, a trap to entice him into low ambition ? Bertha let her knitting fall, and sat musing sadly. If she had the ruling of young people, at least all their aims should be pure, their prizes such as became im mortals ; the attainment of knowledge, their own cultivation, a sense of development, a growth of peace, a deeper comprehension, a loftier and closer realization of the Christian life. Bertha, with her white, pale skin, her light golden hair, her blue eyes raised, and her gaze, floating as it were after an unseen kingdom, her hands locked as we see them on the bosoms of stone effigies, and pointing heavenward, looked a very white dove of inno cence and spiritual longing."], [311, "Kindliness. 299 And had this Bertha no idol in the background of her heart, no covetousness blending with and marring her purity ? Was Bertha good solely for goodness' sake, and could it be said of her, that in all her aspirations, strivings, sacrifices, there was no ulterior motive, that her left hand held no bribe to lure her right to duty, that she was altogether an Israelite without guile ? Let us dwell with Bertha for one or two days, and we shall see. The next morning Bertha awoke early, and as she lay pondering vaguely beneath her eider-down quilt, the clock struck, and with its noise aroused Bertha to the fact, that there was no stir in the next room occupied by her two brothers, who still attended the gymnasium in the mornings ; that they had slept too long ; that they would rise and run away in too great a hurry to go out to the pump and wash, a process of which the sluggish lads were not fond in these October mornings when they had to break the ice from the cistern, and the icy waters caused their round red cheeks to smart and tingle. But Madam K\u0153nig was as cleanly as a Dutch woman, and would suffer no neglect, no slurring over of ablutions ; and she who was everywhere in these morning hours, with her eyes darting into every corner, as the maid Jetta, in her coarse stuff petti coat and jacket, and wooden clogs, knew right well, \u2014 shewould discover the base infringement of family rules and failure in binding ceremonies. She would even send and fetch the boys out of the gymnasium ;"], [312, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 300 she would summon Herr K\u0153nig from his stores, and, putting in his hands a literal ashen stave, she would demand of him the execution of justice upon the criminals, the infliction of the heavy penalty which should save the lads from degenerating into low boys and vagabonds. Well, what of it ? It was no business of Ber tha's. She had no greater predilection for the slippery courtyard, and the iced cistern, and the primitive mode of washing for the boys of the house, than the boys themselves. If she awoke the boys, and urged them to rise and do their duty, they would be impatient and rude to her ; they would give her no thanks, but treat her as a spy and an interloper. Bertha turned to the wall. But then there danced before her Pastor Miiller's house, its loving deeds and life of generous self-sacrifice. How would she be fit for it if she could not even conquer her laziness to aid her brothers ? She would become sit for it; she would prepare herself, and then, to be sure, the ability would be given her to go and sojourn in the city. Bertha sprang out of bed, dressed quickly, and went to Albrecht and Hans's room, and approached their cribs. The boys slept like logs, and were as sulky as bears at being disturbed. \" It is you, you White Mouse,\" called Albrecht. \" What are you doing there ? Can't you lie still, Leonora, until the Spectre Knight fetches you ? \" muttered Hans."], [313, "Kindliness. 301 It was a family joke with the K\u0153nigs to call Bertha Leonora, and argue that her meditative habits were the result of an excess of mourning for a knight slain in the Thirty Years' War. But Bertha thought of the Miillers and perse vered, and at last she got her brothers up and out to the court, and stood in the doorway watching them. \" You had better come and break the ice, Bertha, since you are so forward,\" shouted Albrecht, rue fully, standing without his coat, in his matted hair, winking his eyes, and dabbling with a thick finger at the white flakes in the cistern. Bertha shivered, but what a fine occasion for practising self-denial. \" Get along, Albrecht,\" protested Hans; \" you'll give Bertha the ague.\" After that Bertha thought it was rather pretty and amusing to see her rough, hardy brothers shattering the ice, thrusting in their arms and heads at one bold plunge, coming out blowing and purple, and all the time the rising winter sun, silvery white as the moon, striking upon them without dazzling them. Bertha was so animated that she ran in, poured out the coffee, cut the black bread, and filled the boys' bags with the books for the gymnasium, all with her own hands. \" Thanks to you, Whitemouse ; we see white mice can look alive when they like.\" Brothers are not the most complimentary re cipients of bounties ; but Bertha's heart felt warmed, and two or three times during the day's"], [314, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 302 knitting she thought of the morning scene in the court -yard, and smiled and coupled it with the far-away Miillers, and felt almost certain that she would go to her uncle's in the cultivated, in tellectual, philanthropic city. Bertha was livelier than usual, and more inclined to act than to de vote every stolen moment to reading, and con ning over mentally what she had read. She re flected that if the Miillers were here, they would go in such hard weather, and ask poor old Beata how her stack of wood keeps up, and perhaps read a favourite hymn to her from her song-book. Bertha watched for a favourable moment, and obtained permission from her mother without more than,\" \" You want to lay yourself up again, child, and to have me running up and down to nurse you, as if my poor bones did not ache enough already ?\" To do Bertha justice, she did not think going half-way down the street and inquiring for Beata, and perhaps sitting five minutes on the stool before her stove, was anything very meritorious. Beata was a dependant of the K\u0153nigs. A family must be very poor, or very hard, if it does not number one dependant. What ! worse than Dives ; not so much as a Lazarus at the gate ; not so much as crumbs to fling to him from a better-supplied table ! Beata, in her better days, had assisted to wash and clean for the K\u0153nigs ; now she was bed ridden ; but she was not in any of those abysses of destitution which we see out of Germany. She had"], [315, "Kindliness. 303 been saving ; she had able and willing kinsmen, who helped her ; and a very little in the cheap country sufficed to keep Beata tolerably comfortable on her bed. She was a patient old woman, and fond of old acquaintances like the K\u0153nigs, particularly Bertha, who had been a white dove to the hard-favoured, hard-working, coarsely surrounded old woman. In her fur-cloak, and with her fur-shoes and her warm hood, Bertha did not feel the piercing cold any more than in a sharp tingling, which was not unpleasant to the youthful though somewhat feeble flow of her blood. And how beautiful the streets were under a recently frozen fall of snow, for the snow comes in Northern Germany before the end of October. Bertha did not wonder that her sisters, who were strong, ran out and played at ball with her brothers in their half- hours after dinner and coffee, and even loitered and romped on their return beneath the stars of heaven, and with their own yellow, smoky stars of earth, the horn-lanterns. It was little Rica's play-ground ; think ofthe hardiness of such a nursery ! Actually the little girl (I have it from an eye-witness), with bare, blue-mottled arms and bare blonde head, was shrieking with delight as she scraped the snow from the door-step with her little shovel. Bertha liked their street at all times ; admired it of a summer night, when the tender linden-trees among the houses were shaking out their heart shaped leaves ; when each family of the township"], [316, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 304 sat on the benches before the doors smoking, sing ing, working, drinking beer out of cans, or sour wine out of tall red or blue glasses ; and the pro cession of the cows came in from the meadows, headed by the queen with her bells, and each cow dropped off with a long mellow low, like a ship firing a signal-gun before she casts anchor, in her own cow-house ; and then the buxom young men and women turned out in the centre of the street and played at games, no way removed from \" Catch me if you can,\" and \" In my castle,\" and \" I spy,\" as they did in London in the time of Old Stowe. But, if anything, Bertha preferred the street in winter as it was, after she had chatted to Beata, and slid down her few groschen, and read her a loving, trusting old people's hymn out of her song-book, \u2014 when she returned with the setting sun flooding with rose-colour the spire of the church, the churchyard (where at least one of the Minnesingers slept), with its crosses, and the roofs of the houses ; the rosy-red blushing over the dead, white background. Bertha had only once seen Schneehaufen more beautiful, and then it was with the awful beauty of fire, when a score of the wooden houses crackled and blazed and crashed in glowing ruins, lighting up the excited faces, the wide sky, and the whole expanse of snowy country far and near. The next day was a great day in the K\u0153nigs' house. I daresay you will laugh, and I will let"], [317, "Kindliness. 305 you, when I tell you why. But for all your scornful titter, it was a brave, jovial day, and I have read a lyric of Uhland's, joyous, graphic, sensuous, if you will, but still most ringing, undaunted, and thank ful, which he wrote to celebrate it ; the swine killing day in the German household. The poor swine, which ate the K\u0153nigs' husks, was sacrificed at an early hour of the morning, awakening the neighbours with its dying groans, making them move their heads quickly on their pillows, and murmur, enviously, \" Ah ! the K\u0153nigs' swine ; what full barrels they will have to-day ! What roasts, and frys, and pork-pies ! what sausages, what cracknels ! There are so many of them, that they will not have a bit to spare to anybody besides themselves.\" It had been scalded and scraped, at least undergone processes equivalent to scalding and scraping, betimes, so that by breakfast it was ready for the great process of cutting up and laying down in brine, salt as the ocean. There it lay on a long board, stretched out, not unlike a dead gladiator, while Herr Willy himself was, for that morning, engaged at home on business of im portance, unavoidably detained from his store, his weights and measures. No Schneehaufen cus tomer would be so inconsiderate as to enter Herr K\u0153nig's store-house, expecting to see the prin cipal about Dantzic flour or Breslau cloth, on the K\u0153nigs' swine-killing day. Herr Willy stood over the swine with a cleaver, prepared, as the u"], [318, "306 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. head of the family, to assume the weighty office of breaking up and blocking out the carcase in pre sence of as many interested, competent witnesses as could congregate around him, and witness, with pride and elation, the solemn rite. For one other day, besides Christmas-day, there was a great central bond of union in the K\u0153nig family. What was its weight ? How many pounds of suet had it yielded ? How many hams would be strung and hung ? Would the mother be able to bake out of its riches that very night for supper ? Each eager aspirant rushed in from school and shop with such inquiries, and walked round and round the dead gladiator, \u2014 I protest it was rather unfeeling of them, they had so often fed him and mocked him, as he grunted defiance in his sty \u2014 down to Rica, who was shaking the poor limp trotters, and cla mouring for butter-brod. You may not see the point of the demand, but the economic Germans have three sorts of butter-brod \u2014 prepared from butter proper, from hog's lard (the commonest that) for children, and from \u2014 oh, strong unctuous substi tute ! \u2014 green goose-fat. I must say I cannot altogether sympathize with Bertha in her indifference, approaching to dislike, to the spectacle. I am not so mealy-mouthed. I think there was something in it not at all wire-drawn, but genuinely Saxon and hearty, though it partook of the animal no doubt. What of that ? We are animals as long as we remain in the body, are we"], [319, "Kindliness. 307 not ? Only let us be honest animals, like the butcher's dog, and not over head-strong animals like that worthy either, but animals and immortals as well. It was possible, even in that pig-laden kitchen, even with piggy as the prominent, fair, but ugly object or honour. I dread your false sensibi lity ; I dread it as apt to be but a whited sepulchre, hiding dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Herr Willy looked manly and handsome as he brandished his shining weapon, and prepared to make incisions with the skill of an anatomist. Madam K\u0153nig was less suited to the scene, but she was earnest, quick, and neat-handed as Phillis herself. Here was the glittering salt ready, if not for the sacrifice, for the consecration.

Still, Bertha hung back, and was reluctant to offer any assistance. What ! smear her white fingers with hideous stains, handle these blocks of flesh and fat, and bare, blue-white, exposed bone ; she would rather go with the dough to the oven. Still, her mother wanted her now if she were ever to be wanted at home. Much as Thekla and"], [320, "308 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. Elise would have liked to have stayed to assist, they could not absent themselves from their worsted shop. Agatha could not be spared by her aunt, for the court-chamberlain had arrived overnight, and there was enough stir in Schneehaufen without the killing of the K\u0153nigs' swine to add to it ; but as coffee-sister Korner said, \" People would make a noise in the world by conducting their business at improper times, if you were soft enough to permit it. Witness the Frau Chorister's son, born on Easter morning, just as the Herr Chorister should have been lustily raising the Easter hymn, in which he quavered like a cat, and all but broke down ; yes, all but broke down.\" For Jetta, the servant, the true German peasant, uncouth, cumbrous, with her unstimulated, untrained powers, doltish, \u2014 no one dreamt of confiding any part of this distin guished charge to Jetta, no one expected anything from Jetta but true slavish toil. Madam K\u0153nig would have liked to have done it all herself; she was a generalissimo of a little woman, who would have fought her own battles without soldiers, if that had been admissible ; but Bertha saw, by the contraction of the pupils of the eyes, and the red spots on the thin cheeks, that her mother had one of her terrible headaches, and presently she was staggering back from the barrel and the table, and sinking into a chair almost in a fainting state, as Caroline, our George Second's wife, would sink down after her receptions, and George's card-"], [321, "Kindliness. 309 table and her work only half done. It was bar barous in Bertha not to interpose, though she should hear the waspish \" geh fort,\" equivalent to the English \" get along, do,\" in return for her re luctant advances. Yes, Bertha thought again ofthe noble, loving Miillers, and pushed into the arena. \" You can't, you won't;\" her mother resisted her, but the words came faintly. After all, Bertha had no great difficulty in as suming her post, and keeping her position, and after the first shuddering attempt it was not a bad business, not a bit of it. Bertha rather liked it after she had got accustomed to it, patting the blocks, and packing them dexterously \u2014 as all art-natures are dexterous if they will only condescend to a world-wide vocation \u2014 to the sound of her father's triumphant bravos, and to the light of her mo ther's half-swooning, but ever-vigilant eyes. For me, I like to see Bertha there. She seems to me like the vine-leaves, a link between the real and the ideal, the sensuous and the moral, another, and I hope a happier, Charlotte, as she sliced down bread and butter for hungry children. And Bertha's heart did warm unspeakably, just as I said it did, after the washing of the boys, and she whispered to herself, \" I shall go to the Miillers, I feel certain of it; and I think I shall grow worthy of them.\" You may say that you cannot see what good Bertha's superiority did to her, if it only induced her to scorn common people and common things,"], [322, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 310 and I agree with you entirely.

And then Bertha had been startled to find Hedwig thoroughly interested and exceedingly friendly with every member of the party, not only affording them music, but entering into their follies one after another, being blind folded, giving and receiving riddles, refraining from nothing, but tormenting the hapless hero of the molten lead. And when Bertha had asked curi ously the cause of Hedwig's low contentment, Hedwig had answered with a rare smile, \" Little Bertha, it is the motto in our house to make people as happy as they can be in their own way, unless that be a wicked way ; and, little Bertha, when you grow bigger and older, you will find their way is not so very far behind our way.

I am about to play it out to you, little Bertha, in a piece on the piano, and see if it will not speak to you, and see if you will not listen to its voice.\" Hedwig Miiller's words came rushing back on Bertha, as she stood playing with her gloves. You know her head was full of the Miillers at this time, and their sentences returned upon her memory clear and full and pat to the subjects which they had commemorated. Bertha was glad that she had recalled them in time, for she would have been sorry if their characters had revived in her mind, and re proached her when their own All-Saints Eve party was over. It was not of very much moment to the others, probably ; but Bertha would try, at least, to be companionable. That night, Bertha was surprised to discover of how much moment it was ; how much a disengaged obliging person is always in request ; how she could protect the man with the lead ; how her suggestions that the solid cakes and silvery"], [324, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 312 feathers in the water indicated merchants' bales in the city, and trees in the backwoods, were received with rounds of acclamation, after the former stereo typed visions.

Bertha thought less of the Miillers to-night, less of Rudolph's poetry, and Hedwig's music, and the whole house's reverence and beneficence, and more of being good and doing good, proving a blessing on every day, on swine-killing day, and amidst the gambols of All-Hallow Eve, in what must, after all, be her abiding-place, home."], [326, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 314 Bertha felt as she performed the only rite of All- Hallow Eve which she really liked \u2014 the placing in water the boughs of the cherry-tree, to be budded and blossomed like Aaron's rod by Christmas Eve \u2014 that there was a star in the east rising for her also, to travel on before her steps to her dying day ; a cool, gentle hand laid on her head and her heart, allaying and quieting their fever, their unrest, heal ing all their wounds, giving them \" love, joy, peace,\" never to grow dim, never to fade away. The first thing that Bertha heard next morning, on the day of All Saints, when she entered the family-room, was her father's version of the con tents of a letter open on the table before him. \" Your uncle won't have you, little Bertha ; he has business at Leipsic, and is going to carry his family there for a time ; it has altered his plans.

Nothing, save the flowers, the winter landscape, her books and prayers, her struggles after a higher life destined to perish, doomed to prove her bane. Forgive poor Bertha, for she was mad, as we all are when we rebel ; mad and ungrateful, leaving out many counts in her reckoning, \u2014 her God and Lord, his beautiful world here, his glorious heaven hereafter ; her kindred, faithful though uncongenial; her poet friends, whom she knew in spirit, whom she would know in another and a truer day, even as she was known ; her faculties of body and soul.

Bertha was forced, like the rest of the world, to stifle her pains, and sit in the family-room at work at some of the endless German enterprises in knit ting and embroidery. Then her father spoke to her in his waggish, roguish way, standing, as he had done one day before, striking chords on the piano. \" Peter is getting on with his choral hymn ; I must find him that Niirnberg egg.\" Bertha put her hand to her head ; why did she feel as if she had received another blow, a blow, however, rather rousing and quickening this time."], [329, "Kindliness. 317 Oh, self-deluded soul, what had she wanted but a Niirnberg egg for her duty !

Soon she would have been asking heaven for her wages. Bertha was very penitent, but she was comforted too, poor soul, for her loss ; she thought tenderly and tearfully ofthe vision of Schiller, whom people call unconsciously Christian in his chivalry and in his paganism. She thought of the poet's plea to Jove, when king and trader, husbandman and abbot, had forestalled the dreamer, and robbed him of land and sea, bread and wine. Great Jove took nothing back, only, in atonement, he granted one grace to the poor son of the muses, \" Heaven is always open to thee, come and dwell with me whenever thou wilt,\" and the poet was resigned, was blest. Should the Christian maiden be meaner and duller than the heathen poet ? Could her Bible, illumined by heaven's own rays, tell her no nobler, sweeter tale than Schiller's lyric ?

Therefore, to act jn violent contradiction to established laws and prece dents, to set at defiance the fashion alike of time and place, is not, unless in a case of strict necessity, a wise, far less a modest proceeding. It is par ticularly senseless and aggravating in women whose power, like that ofthe old Roman tribunes, is that of quiet, steady vetos.

And, with regard to the women of the middle rank, there is one light in which fashion seizes them with an engrossing supremacy in which it does not affect women of wealth and station.

The labour of a working man, a slave, a pack-horse, is not greater, by comparison, than the groaning efforts, the address, the stoicism of a poor woman running after fashion, keeping up appearances, or rather deluding herself and her neighbours into be lieving herself the fine lady, and her family the dashing, luxurious household. Luxurious house hold indeed ! they are as far from attaining to this as they are from possessing the dignity, repose, honest hospitality, and loyal brotherly kindliness which was originally within their reach. I am anxious to state, that in these remarks I do not at all refer to the womanly desire to have all things at home, furniture and apparel, nice and pleasant ; to the sense of the beautiful and the graceful, which cultivation supplies ; to the tender pains, the genial, joint efforts by which family-life is unspeakably gladdened and brightened ; to the trouble and energy by which a frugal mother has her children respectable, neat, smart. No, no ; these are the sweet blossomings over of truth, affection, self-respect, and faithful regard for kindred.

Even when there is a little sense to hold back in time from this common conclusion, such lives are fertile in falsehood, de ceit, unlovely calculations and speculations, and barren in all nobleness, gentleness, and gene rosity.

Do not give to dress more than a modest portion of your hours and ideas.

To be notorious for the cut and colour of your garments, has been in every age the temporary ebullition of eccentricity, or the sign of a weak, low, or giddy mind.

They were open, like children, in their mischief, and their ingenuity was very like the ingenuity of children. You must not suppose they were stupid or slow ; they were very clever, very quick.

Their father was a colonel in the army, of good family, and with a handsome pension ; but, for some reason or other, he kept his family bare of money. Their mother was dead, and their aunt took them into society, tolerably high society of the time, where Fanchon and Aimee were well received, though they were not yet promised in marriage, notwithstanding it was supposed they would have fair doweries for Frenchwomen. Perhaps this comfortable view of the case tended to make Fanchon and Aimee break bounds. Their aunt always thought they did her great credit. Her only grief about her charges was that they had no conventual stillness about them ; they were not altogether retiring and mute, as young girls should be. They spoke and"], [344, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 332 laughed almost like married women. After all, these dreadful Nineties shook the proprieties of French women ; the excitement pervading all classes, the general interest of the questions mooted, the cloud hanging luridly and heavily over the country, until it caught the most careless eyes, rendered the Frenchwomen of the Nineties a different order of Frenchwomen from any that went before or came after them. But it was only the beginning of the time, and the Le Bruns were no great politicians ; they only knew enough of the raging, conflicting currents of the day, to be aware that it required exquisite tact, a kind of second instinct, fine, shrewd, and chame leon-like to encounter them successfully ; and they did so encounter them with their light heads and barren experiences. You may think that it was heartless even in the young Le Bruns to be so little affected by the straits of the people, the peril of kings, that they should dance on in the salons after they had seen that ghastliest dance of the people in the streets ; but remember when Troy was on the eve of falling, there was only Cassan dra among the Trojan maids who refused to dance and sing, and Cassandra was a prophetess.

Fanchon and Aimee had enough to do, as they understood life.

It was hard work with Fanchon and Aimee. Often they sat in a back room all day, sewing like the veriest drudges of sempstresses, and never re ceiving a penny for their labour ; giving out rather the few pennies they possessed. When the Colonel was abroad, they fasted as religiously as on Friday. I declare to you, these young, growing, hungry girls were sometimes giddy from insufficient or improper food, and often experienced violent nervous head aches from the same cause ; and this they endured that they might procure sandals from the royal Marie Antoinette's boot-maker ! They would tra verse the whole disorderly city, under the care of the old porteress, with thick veils over their hats, choking for breath, and ready to sink on the trottoir with fatigue, for the cheapest set of Roman pearls, when everything Roman was coming into vogue. Worse than that, the girls were shabby in their remuneration of the old porteress ; who had no longer the wages of her husband and sons, as they"], [348, "336 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. deserted their trades to watch with haggard, fierce faces, at the doors of the clubs, and obtain, se cond-hand, the wild eloquence, which they drank in like a dram of fiery cognac. Fanchon or Aimee would endow her with a fragment of sodden galette, a jar of fermented comfiture, a spangled, cast-off scarf or apron, of no use whatever to the poor woman, unless she were willing to foot Paris, city and faubourgs, bridges and ruelles, a second time, to dispose of it to the smallest profit. This was not because Fanchon and Aimee were naturally grasping and covetous. They were good-natured and kindly, but they drove such hard bargains themselves, they travelled such weary roads often, they ate such inferior galette and thin comfiture with sharp appetites, that broken victuals, and cast-off clothes magnified themselves in their ima ginations, and became quite good enough for Mere Coralie. If you would seek out those who are the hardest of the hard to dependants, and that often without the most distant consciousness of the fact, you will find them among the suffering bond-slaves of fashion, the poor, labouring men and women, who would fain make ropes out of sand \u2014 a great show on small means. Many a time Fanchon and Aimee were cruelly disappointed, cheerful as they were by constitution. They would go out in their hard-won, though flimsy company-dresses, and some insipid heiress from the provinces, some dashing prononcee dame,"], [349, "Fashion. 337 with a sullied reputation (poor thing, poor thing, speak gently of her, all her stains were washed out in the blood-pool beneath the guillotine), far, far outshone them. They grew so desperate in their race after costume and style, that they lost sight of their own crystal ornaments of grisette-gaiety, they would let themselves be extinguished by such trifling advantages as Mademoiselle Berille's white crape, and Madame de Biron's amazonian girdle. They would sit discomfited and heart-broken, un less they happened to be placed between a royalist banker and a republican journalist, each an unexcep tionable partie, and found themselves imperatively called upon to conduct a light, airy conversation so as to please both of them. Many a time they returned home spent with exertion unrewarded, and vexation unalloyed by the gentle consolations of gentler minds. I daresay you judge Fanchon and Aimee very frivolous, and so they were, but, before you con demn them, consider their rearing, their atmos phere. These don't alter sin, but they alter our estimation of the sinner. I repeat, in their de fence, some of my dolls' virtues. They were obedient without a question of so much as dis affection, they were very industrious, they were fond of each other, and of Monsieur le Colonel \u2014 of him in a respectful mode, of each other in a brisk, transparent way. They were, as I have said before, candid for French girls, and they were, Y"], [350, "338 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. being young girls, innocent. They were punctual in their Roman Catholic observances, intending, without any sense of strange presumption and fraud, to become devout in their old age. So with their father. It is a fashion of our day to laugh at those old Bourbon officers, as we laugh at everything ; but when they came to England in shoals of emigres, they were admired by a foreign and hostile people, and with reason, for their forti tude, their patience, their unobtrusive manliness, their unshrinking, unremitting efforts at sustaining their poor broken lives. They were admired also, no doubt, for what was better understood \u2014 their grand air, their lively gestures, their nimble dancing. Monsieur le Brun, in his young days, or in his old days, if the last had been less tottering and pre carious, might have been arrogant, selfish, cruel ; but the dreadful times in which he lived had sobered him. He was quiet and tolerant ; he lived at a great distance from his children, certainly ; he thought of them as babies, girls, women, in his pitying, half-chivalrous, half- contemptuous fashion; but he cared for them. Monsieur le Brun was wary ; he foresaw the storm impending, in which the sword he had used so gallantly once on a day could not save him any longer. He tried hard to lay by a provision for a rainy day. He was not so fortunate in securing his funds, as in saving the lives of his family. The thunder-bolt burst an hour too soon. Monsieur's store was so far safe,"], [351, "Fashion. 339 that it was regained by his grandchildren ; but it was never out of France ; not a franc of it was fingered by himself in his adversity. What of that ? They must fly \u2014 all the same \u2014 for life and liberty ; and thrice happy they who escaped with them. What was beginning the world anew among the cold looks of strangers, to remaining in that city of destruction ? It was a small con sideration that the fugitives were, many of them, up in years ; and that the obscure by- paths in which they now sought fortune, and the aching joints and sweating brows which the pursuit brought them, had been unknown in their youth and prime. If their hearts failed them, yonder, across the channel, was a hecatomb of slaughtered dead to scare them with horror, when it did not fire them with fury. But they were Frenchmen ; they were philosophers ; they would bear their misfortunes even jauntily ; they would scrape to gether the means of existence ; they would make bold strokes, not for wives, but for mouthfuls of vegetables and cups of coffee ; they would live where an Englishman would starve, and pick up their corn among his unobservant, stiff, clumsy feet. Fanchon and Aimee had known little more of the coming desolation ; they had grown used to conventions and national guards. They had been out dancing at an assembly, and there was no fureur among the guests that they had seen ; no barricades in the streets, no blood on the hands"], [352, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 340 of the citizens. But when they returned home, Monsieur le Brun was waiting for them ; he showed the astonished girls passports ; he bade them put on their plainest clothes for a long jour ney ; he informed them that a carriage, which would pass through the nearest gates and join a diligence, would be at the door within an hour. But their aunt, their friends, their engagements, their malles ; how could they possibly pack up their mattes within an hour ? Monsieur was imperturb able. Perhaps he had already heard of Marie Antoinette and her necessaire, which cost her so dear. The girls submitted, as only French girls would do, and collected more trash of valuables within the hour than any but Frenchwomen could accomplish. I daresay they spent their time upon that, rather than visiting every corner of the old house in the Rue Rivoli, and kissing and crying over the porteress. The inexorable colonel, trained to military lightness of baggage, threw out all their bundles before he stepped into the fiacre ; still the girls only clasped their hands, and raised their black eyes, and marvelled and schemed how they were to obtain new necklaces. A hurried, dismal journey to the coast, a huddled together, rough, wretched passage from port to port, and very cheap lodgings high in the air, some where near Covent Garden, were the next stages in the story of my poor dolls. There they lived for a while, depending on Monsieur's lessons in"], [353, "Fashion. 341 languages. Their life was not so different from their former one, except that it wanted all the sauce and spice. They moiled with the farthings of Mon sieur's earnings to keep up the faint copies of their elaborate toilettes. When the weather was very fine, and their cheap toilettes especially effective, they walked in Kensington Gardens and the parks, and were brushed by the rich skirts of the English ladies, and occasionally bespattered by the riders. They had always the French chapel, where they encountered a few well-known faces whom they could not afford to entertain at close quarters, and were aware that their owners were making as frantic efforts as they were themselves to preserve their soiled gold lace, their threadbare cloth and embroidery. There they whispered to each other real tragedies, and surely worshipped with more fervour in their extremity. It was a sad, aimless mockery of a life, and the girls could not avoid perceiving how wrecked it was, and they would exclaim in their liquid French, and cry their bright black eyes as dim as such eyes could become. Then one cold, chill winter day, the Colonel was prostrated by rheumatism; rose and could not stand ; tried to lift his hand to his head and failed, with the arm so racked by pain that it was incap able of any other activity. The exposures of his old campaigns were telling upon him, now that his pension was forfeited"], [354, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 342 The girls did not look at each other, and fold their hands ; they were not like dolls at this crisis. \" Fanchon, it is necessary that we work for ourselves and our father.\" \" Yes, Aimee, let us begin. What will you that we try ?\" They never hesitated. The doctor was impressed and edified by the resignation with which they listened to his cautious warnings of how little poor Monsieur's powers could be depended upon in the future, and with the alacrity with which they set about their search for employment. Even Mon sieur was not prostrated in mind by the prostration of his body. He had treated his daughters as dolls, still more than I have done, but he never seemed to doubt that they would come forward as very use ful dolls when the occasion demanded it of them. Fauchon and Aimee laid their heads together on their qualifications \u2014 their stock in trade. Of all takings of stock, this is perhaps the one usually involving the most trepidation, the most cowardly palpitations, and desperately faint hearts. But the French girls did it coolly. They thought of dancing, giving lessons in dancing to schools and private families. They had not interest and accomplishments for the stage, or I don't think they would have repudiated it. They had to give up the idea of dancing. At that era every pension required an Adonis, in knee-"], [355, "Fashion. 343 breeches and buckles, to preside over the art of Terpsichorfe ; the market was glutted, and the yellow, grinning marquises, barons, and counts had the best of it. Then they thought of artificial flower-making, which they had learnt in their convent-parlour, and prosecuted for their own con venience. Here they were likely to be more suc cessful, and a very little capital provided the cam bric, the vermilion, the ultramarine, the jonquil yellow, the wire, and the gum. How skilfully and rapidly the girls manufactured their wares ! What bunches of jasmine, what pink and white lilies (being French, they did not confine themselves to white lilies ; pink lilies were charmants, ravissants, and so they proceed boldly to their construction), and such French, such very French forget-me-nots. When they had completed their performances, they disposed of them to the shops themselves quite easily and safely. They were accustomed to shopping ; and the linen-drapers, milliners, dressmakers, liked the workers, liked their punctuality, self-reliance, the vivacity of their broken English. As for ene mies, sinister patrons, these girls detected them at a glance and shunned them. They could take care of themselves, young as they were, as honest, fearless, alert girls can generally do. Monsieur, too, Monsieur had faith in them, to his honour as a Frenchman, or else to the honour of the England, the perfide Albion, in which he trusted, Monsieur relied on his girls without a qualm. The milliners"], [356, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 344 and mantua- makers would ask Fanchon and Aimee's advice with regard to the disposal of the sprigs and wreaths, and would engage their taste and expertness for half days and whole days together. They fell in with some of their own countrymen ; they got work to carry home, so they varied their trades and acquired double profits ; and they were so keen, so zealous, and withal, so good-humoured, they so enjoyed making money and handing it over to the Colonel, though they were not avaricious ! They had their crosses, of course ; crosses are not confined to ladies of fashion, but they did not take them half so much to heart as when they led a centreless, pointless whirl of a life. I daresay, when their French natures were tempted to long for the footlights, the dancing, and a more effer vescent admiration than that of the honest shop keepers, they thought with a shudder of the horrors that were then being enacted in gay, \u25a0distinguished France, and thanked heaven for their dull, obscure banishment. Fanchon and Aimee had no time now for their grand toilettes a la baronne ; their plaiting, and pinching, and curling, and rustling here and there before a little oval looking-glass, with only them selves to please and profit by their application. They sat with their crisp hair twisted under their little caps, in their peignoirs. I wish I could say these peignoirs were as fresh and nice as they should have been ; but then, I have vowed to tell"], [357, "Fashion. 345 nothing but the truth, as far as my judgment goes, and these faded, crushed peignoirs clad young, plump, agile bodies, and did not offend Monsieur, since he could not have the floating muslin, white or rose tendre colours, which the French hold fittest for young girls. No ; nor did they offend any friend and countryman who called to play a game of dominoes with the Colonel, and chat with the girls. Dear ! Fanchon and Aimee began anew to sing their old romances and barcarolles, and to give them more gleefully than in the salons of Paris. Fanchon and Aimee had an invitation to Rich- mond, to a party of emigres. It was one of those fete days, which they had been wont to respect almost as they had respected mass and the confes- sional, and it was to be celebrated in the country, the summer-country, and the celebration included the company of equals, sunshine, talk, and laugh- ter, and, perhaps, in conclusion, a dance on the green. What were not all these to the two con- fined, toiling work-women ? \" Yet, we cannot go,\" cries Fanchon ; \" see, we have that sheaf of roses to complete ; we have promised, and we must not offend Monsieur, who employed us first.\" \" But if we sit up very late,\" urges poor Aimee plaintively ; \" we have no pleasure now, Fanchon ; and our father is so well, he could do without us for a day. Could we not manage it ?\""], [358, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 346 \" It might have been possible, Aimee, had it not been for our dress ; but we cannot go like work-people. We would need to sit up a whole night to wash and starch and iron our gowns and mantles, and to dye our gloves, ribbons, and fichus, and very triste they would appear when all was done, my sister.\" \" I wish we could go like work-people,\" sighs Aimee. \" Impossible,\" replies Fanchon, with unusual tartness ; but when Aimee repeats how well they and their circumstances are known among their friends ; how irresponsible they are for the disasters of la belle France ; how they could wear \u2014 what could they wear ? not the peignoirs, but the pretty cali cos which the worthy linen-draper gave them over and above their payment, and gipsy-hats \u2014 \" and then, do you know, Fanchon, they might think it was la pastorale \u2014 that we were masquerading.\" \" Bah ! \" exclaims Fanchon, \" that deceives nobody ; but as you are devoured with chagrin because we miss the day in the country, and as it is in England, and yet among our own people, we may think of going en deshabille ; but mind, Aimee, mind we can never show our faces in Paris again, if it comes to be known.\" \" Ah ! I will leave dear Paris to take care of itself,\" declares fickle Aimee, and darts to the drawers to examine the calicos in which they are to figure perforce en pastorale. The girls go to"], [359, "Fashion. 347 their fete as simply dressed as hay-makers of a Sunday, but still with their nameless elegance and grace. They delight in the view, the trees, the grass, the primroses, the very singing-birds are novelties to them ; they delight in the most rustic food, eaten in the most rustic inn ; they stroll about, and exchange sparkling French witticisms and picturesque French sentiments, just as Monsieur de Chateaubriand describes his company. \" And, Fanchon, how happy we have been,\" says Aimee, on her return to the garret, near Covent Garden, \" as happy as if we had worn diamonds.\" \" Tell that to your bridegroom, Aimee, before he furnishes your corbeitte ; but, after all, it is true, I never was happier in France ; it sounds unfaith ful, but I believe it is because we are so occupied here, and it is so much more of a fete to us now than it used to be.\" \" For me, Fanchon,\" confesses Aimee, \" I think it is better in itself, all except the absence from our country, and the misery of the Revolu tion, and our father's infirmities. It is so pleasant this sort of society, so impromptu, so easy.\" \" Faineante ! you want to go out like a school girl ; you forget the bienseances, the proprietes, our rank, our class.

THE LIFE OF PRIDE AND LEVITY. There has been always a tendency in the world to withdraw pride from its place among the deadly sins, and that in spite of direct denunciations against it. \" Pride cometh before destruction.\" \" God hateth a high look.\" This favour seems to arise from two causes. Pride itself is a hard, selfish, and actually a mean temper in its narrowness and arrogance ; but no other disposition has such a faculty of clothing itself like an angel of light, putting on the garb and showing the features of dignity, noble ness, magnanimity. For a second stronger reason, other qualities are habitually mistaken for pride. Shyness, for instance, which is often found in com pany with its opposite, humility ; self-respect, which is an honest man's inheritance ; independence, which is a brave man's portion ; bluntness, which we cannot, for the life of us, dissever from truth. Call pride insolence, whether superb or vulgar, 319"], [362, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 350 and you will make no mistakes. The impatience of interference with your plans, the loud or dogged assertion of your will, the slighting or sweeping condemnation of all beneath your sovereign notice; this is very unlovely and unloveable. But this tone, like that of mock ignorance of household work and rural economy, is, we are glad to say, much exploded with women, in so far as clearly established inferiors are concerned. Few girls hector in a shop, or storm over a servant, before their associates, because they are very well aware that in so doing many eyes will be fixed on them in censure. They have learned at last that it is not like gentlewomen to be imperious and tyrannical. Where they can undoubtedly command, and where they feel a strong call to be insolent, they are merely languid, supercilious, and sneering. But it is in that \" debatable land\" which a good, earnest writer has classed as \"the missing link\" in the social chain, that insolence remains rampant. Among acquaint ances, a shade removed from the girls in rank and refinement, inferiors by an inappreciable degree, which no mortal but themselves would take the trouble {o reckon, \u2014 it is towards the common place, the tiresome, the shabby, that insolence still flourishes in full bloom. It is by what are called \" Cuts,\" by shades of cordiality, varying far more suddenly and violently than our weather -gauges, that simple, sincere folk are tried. \" Really the way that girl bowed to me in the"], [363, "The Life of Pride and Levity. 351 Crescent was insufferable. I can bear a good deal of nonsense from girls, having had girls of my own ; but for a child like that to think it a fit thing to recognise a staid old woman like me, by simply lowering her eye-lids ! \" complains the respectable mother of a family ; \" and it was only in spring she sent her love, and could I give her some bramble-jam for her cold, nothing did her good like my bramble-jam, and I am sure I did not grudge it. I was delighted that she should have recourse to me ; but I must say I expected a little livelier sense of my existence.\" \" They are all the same, mother,\" answers a little bitterly the somewhat worn eldest daughter, at the same time much more indignant at the slight put upon her mother than at any neglect to herself. \" If you had seen how reluctant Agnes Jones was to see me to-day, because she was walking with the Stephensons. I shall be blind enough the next time I meet her, though it should be before her admirer, Mr. Forester, who was so much obliged to my brother George.\" No, no, Agnes, you will forgive and forget ; you will warm your sometimes weary heart by the consciousness that you have not done anything to spoil Agnes Jones's fine prospects, little as she thanks you for it ; and long after this small vexation is past and gone, you, who are so candid and loving, will understand to the full that verse of the psalm, \" Thou hast put more joy and gladness in my cup"], [364, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls 352 since the time that their corn and oil and wine abounded.\" But in our day the life of pride, of strong, domi neering self-importance has generally accepted also the cue ofthe life of levity, \u2014 the life which finds a joke in everything, which laughs at all reverence, earnestness, and romance. It is one of the hardest and most hostile aspects ofthe human mind which you can encounter. Talk to a young lady who aspires to be \"fast\" \u2014 who quotes the broadest slang, and must have \" larks,\" if not \" sprees \" \u2014 talk of self-sacrifice, of high, pure thoughts, of lives happy in their holiness, and she will vote you \" slow,\" shrug her shoulders, remark upon your neck-ribbon or your bootlace, be witty at your expense, and have nothing more to do with you. She may have too much passive principle to denominate your conver sation humbug, but she will think you old-fashioned, prudish, sentimental, superannuated, officious, in trusive. She will jeer at you unmercifully, or be seriously incensed if you provoke her further. All the while she may pay respect to the outward forms of religion, to churches, prayer-meetings, Sabbath schools, benevolent societies, private devotions, and far be it from me to say she is insincere ; but there is surely the oddest incongruity in her conduct. Now a good laugh is an excellent thing, and the most of us firmly credit it is enjoyed in its per fection by the best men and women in the world. We can set our seals to the description of such"], [365, "The Life of Pride and Levity. 353 sick-rooms as George Wilson's, where the good and patient lie not only in an attitude of meekness and resignation, but spread around them a clear, sunny atmosphere of humour and fun. Who should be happy but those who are at peace with God and man ? But this incapacity for viewing anything under a serious aspect, this incredulity of all high duty, sustained effort, generous self-abnega tion, and growing unworldliness is, we should ven ture to say, very far from what Mr. Punch himself contemplates. If I recollect aright, a son of Legh Richmond's spoke severely on his deathbed against the former merry cast of his conversation on all topics with a young sister. Reading this observation when very young, it pained me, and I thought it very harsh. I still regard it as extremely morbid. The young will gambol in mind as well as body. Their Maker gave them this early buoyancy, and we may well shrink from taking it from them. I would never object to its use, only to its abuse. I am aware there are some kindly spirits who re tain this blessed buoyancy to old age. I know there are constitutions whose deep feelings almost always speak half jestingly, with a touch of the comic for ever relieving the tragic side of their natures. There are those who would be sombre without this tendency, and whose sense of pathos is so quick and keen that they are glad to weld it with laughter, to take off, as it were, the piquant z"], [366, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 354 edge of its pitifulness, and they generally preserve the characteristic to the last. I am not sure whether it is not a healthful counterbalance to save them from moping melancholy or desperate despair. But this is quite another thing from that bold levity which regards all life as a joke, and whose desire after sport is as keen as any hunter's or fisher's. The zest with which such girls follow amusement, in the shape of practical jokes, and making butts of weak acquaintances, has been before now exposed. But a good girl will hold back from such a course ; \" her delicate sense of honour \" will prevent her from being a party to any modified version of the frolics which appear to form a distinguishing fea ture of some departments of her Majesty's ser vice. Her fuller, richer nature will reject with aversion the emptiness of laughter which has no strong background of thought and feeling. She will not live a life of rushing here and there, and giggling violently. Her quiet perception of pro priety v/ill revolt at the personal notoriety which captivates the other girls. For you will find that the great desire of the poor girl, born and bred to the life of pride and levity, is to make you stare, to confound your sober senses, to strut before you, to push you out of your place, to tread on your skirts, and finally to eclipse your view with her high, vain head, and to raise a noisy clamour which shall effec tually drown all grave discussion, considerate fore thought, and tender memories and anticipations."], [367, "The Life of Pride and Levity. 355 THE ROOMS IN THE OLD HOUSE. THE FIRST ROOM. The house was an old London house, near the river. It was a house of some age at the time of which I write, as it showed by its wide, low doors, its mullioned windows, its fine oak carvings ; but it was so conveniently and pleasantly situated, that it continued a dwelling-place of the quality for several generations to come. The water was still the water of painted barges and gilded wherries. It was still the pink of the mode, and the delight of all delights for women gay, idle, and luxurious, to loll in these deep windows, examine the company on the river, award and apportion signals and make eyes to the rowers of their acquaintance. Occasionally the parties, engaged in this profitable employment, wore masks ; but they were frequently as eager to display their own persons, as to study those of their neighbours. I want to show you this house as it appeared in 1 66-, in one of its rooms overhanging the river.

There they sit, these miserable beauties of an English reign, the ripe fruit of pride and levity, of utter heartlessness; and of a far lower tone of principle than many an old Greek and Roman attained in his own wisdom, and amidst the darkness and corruption of the heathen world. We know the little curls plastered on the round ivory brows, and soft pink cheeks ; and hanging thick and full in studied luxuriance on the arched necks ; the white arms, all bare, flung out on the window-sill; the costly lace floating loose from the shoulders ; the sweeping trains. How well we know them, and how little we like them ! Who would seek such women as these for wives and mothers ? Who would not recoil from intimate communion with their base beauty, as from the dead whiteness of leprosy ? There the women jeer at each other, and at the . spectacle before them.

But when the boat with the Life-guardsmen, in their scarlet and gold, approaches, and one is holding his feathered hat in his hand, and con ceitedly combing his scented wig with an ivory comb, and another is rising and bowing, his hand on his heart, with impudent gallantry ; then they nod, and smile, and mince, and swim, and fan themselves, and dart glances of hatred at each other, until one knows not whether to sink to the ground with affront at their voluntary idiocy or grief at their universal malice. A funeral in sable and crape, with muffled music and wailing dirge, floats under the window, and one smells at her essence-box, and another flouts at the chief mourner. One poor sinner may wince and droop her head, thinking, with a canker in her heart, of her old father and mother under the yews in the country church yard ; or of her little child, to watch by whose dying bed she did desert for a night or so the king's or the duke's theatre ; but her companions make faces at the poor wretch behind her back, and, looking into her dim eyes, twit her with hypocrisy.

THE LIFE OF SENSE AND HEAVINESS There is another life, the reverse of that of pride and levity, and yet, in many respects, in sipid, incapable of enduring excellence, and unfit for immortality. I do not know that it is so attractive to young girls. I think it is more a dull refuge for those who have been smitten, who have begun existence eager and sensitive, who have experienced disappointment, and in its sting and chill they have sullenly or apathetically re solved to be content with what is ; for, alas ! the life of sense and heaviness is no better than a Christianized version of \" Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" But there are endless ex ceptions to all rules ; and to the craving, restless spirit of every age, enduring the pangs of hunger, and the wounds of being baffled and bruised in the prison-house of this world, the waters of Lethe murmur of rest, quiescence, torpor. Ah ! but 3:71"], [372, "360 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. these waters of Lethe are very different from the waters which the gospel discloses ; the last are the waters of life, \" the living fountains ;\" and the first are the waters of forgetfulness, stupefaction, death. In this life of sense and heaviness there may be, there almost invariably is, as there can be even in a life of pride and levity, a scrupulous attention to all outward spiritual adjuncts, but within there is a singular sluggishness and coldness. There is, generally, an inclination to repudiate utterly all chivalrous, romantic adventure and speculation, forgetting how these things were wont to pertain to Christianity. There is a disposition to merge all individuality into one mould and pattern ; and, therefore, this life of sense and heaviness recom mends itself exceedingly to the stolid, the timid, and the lazy, as very respectable. Nothing erratic about it ; no perplexing paradox, no disastrous, no shameful fall ! Respectability and comfort are the leading articles of this life ; for men, having renounced passion and imagination, naturally fall back on what they consider the lawful gratification of their senses, after they have performed their duty in their business and their church. Families of this type have the most commo dious houses, the most prolific gardens (they take more to vegetables than to flowers), and, if they are of sufficient wealth, the easiest carriages. They indulge in what we may call domestic luxu ries and family extravagances. They generally"], [373, "The Life of Sense and Heaviness. 3 6 1 deserve the credit of making all comfortable around them. They never know the shifts of the poor, pretentious slave of fashion. There is a commend able sincerity about them ; their inner garments are as soft and fine as their outer wear. They have a natural repugnance to what is glaring of every description ; perhaps, because in their pa tient, accurate researches after comfort and re spectability, they have found too much light trying to the eye, and intoxicating to the brain. But the bugbear which they present to the world is dire dullness, and their mortal enemies are hardship and fatigue ; for very few things in this world, for no wonders of nature, or treasures of art will they risk them. The voices in such families are care fully moderated, the faces calm ; the daughters are self-possessed and still, industrious or idle, as it may be, but their industry is the most matter-of-fact and humdrum description, as if something new and out of the way, even in a piece of fancy-work, would break the spell. This life has its virtues ; it is a better life than its opposite life ; it is solvent, and it is not essen tially and thoroughly false ; but it also is untrue to our higher natures ; and it also is, to a certain ex tent, demoralizing and degrading. Its most con spicuous disadvantage is stagnancy, and we are all well enough acquainted with the consequences of stagnancy in the material world. Here, too, thought and feeling lose their freshness and vigour."], [374, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 362 A life of sense and heaviness is a life of narrowness and sloth ; it is not a life of progress such as a Christian's should be ; it fosters intolerance, it checks heroism, and, my dear friend, if you do not know that heroism is identical with Christianity, then you greatly mistake either the one or the other. Look abroad, and see the results of this life hovering over many of the representatives of grim but glorious Puritans, wild but grand Covenanters, enthusiastic but ennobled Methodists. They are not satisfactory. They are a tenacious adherence to the swaddling-bands of the child, illiterate un charitableness, and a kind of morose self-indul- gence. Do not, then, let any young girl fancy that she is one of the salt of the earth, because she has never cared, or has ceased to care, for song or story, dance or jest, for travelling or painting ; because she confines herself to house-keeping and sewing useful work, and reading solid books, and taking a walk with papa and mamma ; because she abjures rambling and scrambling, and cannot sit up of nights, and is quite surprised that any one can be interested in such old-world foolery as belongs to May-mornings, and Yule-nights, and Easter days. Above all, do not let her think it very silly of her brother Harry to make such a work about his dog, and to be so set on soldiering, and do not let her fear that he is seriously in the wrong when"], [375, "The Life of Sense and Heaviness. 363 he will go away on these boisterous shooting and boating excursions, and insist on caring a thousand times more for games of all sorts than she could ever do. THE SECOND ROOM. The window no longer looked to the water, but to the city street, dark with tall houses, and re sounding with clatter and din. It was not that the inhabitants did not like the water, they did like it, and they liked trim gardens leading down to it, with formal walks, and clipped privet, box, and holly ; but they thought it a waste of time to in dulge their tastes, and considered it altogether more commendable to keep them in abeyance. So they sat in the front room, and worked at plain spin ning and heavy white-seam. Dutch William was on the throne ; Blackmore was the poet ; Hans Sloane the painter ; all was order, industry, and sobriety. No matter that the order was rigidity, the industry drudgery, the sobriety primness. The flowing hair, the bare arms and shoulders, were all gone, and in their place the highest of stomachers, the stiffest of sleeves, and such a tower of ribbons and lace \u2014 \" pinners with pur dan,\" Swift called it \u2014 reared on the top of the head to confer dignity. We never had such an"], [376, "364 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. ugly headgear as in the reign of good Queen Mary, she whom her husband loved so well, she who died so sweetly. The work went on in that house by the river like clock-work. It was the fashion now to work. William worked in his council-chamber and on his battle-fields. His favourites were not given over to foppery and frippery. Albemarle worked ; Portland worked. What do you think of the Lord Mayor's wife, that worshipful madam, the Lady Mayoress, being a mantua-maker and milli ner in William's reign, all for the glory of work ing ? It would be a remarkable thing in our day if women trooped to the Mansion-house to buy feathers and laces, in place of to wear them. It was not an unsatisfactory life to those who were used to it. Perhaps it was too satisfactory, puffed up the performers, rendered them swollen with a heavy species of pride, a dull inertness, a dogged self-conceit and stubbornness. But think what this life must have been to a young thing from the country, from a lavish, careless, gay, gambolsome country-house, which had its own cloud, its own skeleton and serpent, to be sure, but one of its denizens had not lived long enough to discover them ! From hall and summer-parlour, from hunt ing and hawking, from sun-dial and sweet-pot, from frisking like the dogs, or basking, like them, on the door-step, from revelry which had only gaiety and glamour to a child, from the sudden ruin which only"], [377, "77/i? Life of Sense and Heaviness. 365 frightened, and did not make her wiser \u2014 from these pleasant scenes a young girl was withdrawn, brought up to town, and deposited in the house by the river. The dame of Mary's reign vowed to fulfil in a proper spirit the charge thrust on her. There should be no indulgence, no toying and trifling. She would expel the Egyptian blood ; she would rear the little cousin like her own staid, demure, daughters ; and in this, take note, there was not merely strict justice, but worthy generosity. This country cousin, the dame (her aunt) professed had been picked up out of Sodom and Gomorrah, but I fear her righteous tongue was sharp-edged as those ofthe Jews of old. I do not discover that the place which she called a fiddling playhouse, \u2014 where other poetry was read than that of Black more, \u2014 where the owners had a disposition to ruffle their feathers and pipe their follies loudly, contained any grosser vice 01 deadlier crime ; and it paid its penalty, and perished lamentably in a mistaken ovation to unhappy Monmouth. The child was slight and small-boned, and as supple as an eel, with one of those olive com plexions which show green with ill-health and rage, but which in vigour and joy are strangely, duskily, bright and beautiful, like a pomegranate. She had large eyes, which could flash and lighten and darken in away which the dame(her aunt) saidwas more like a cat's eyes than a human being's. First when she"], [378, "366 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. came to London, she was stunned by misfortune, \u2014 the death of some of her family, the exile of others, the change from license and lightness to dependence and severe discipline. It took her months to revive and reassert her real nature. By that time her rela tions had got used to her presence, and they had come to consider her \u2014 not unkindly, mind, never with wilful unkindness \u2014 as one of themselves, far behind them in available knowledge and capacity, but still one of themselves. They were as startled as they could well be when she began to ask when was their mumming, their maying ; if they always droned on in this style ; if they had no diversion. What ! neither at Christmas nor Easter \u2014 the Christian holidays, nor at Midsummer, the festival of the year, nor at the bountiful term of good St. Martin ? Her keepers did not suffer themselves to be amused ; they rebuked her when she was naughty, when she protested that she would go to sleep over that solemn discussion on the rival merits of altars and pulpits, lawn sleeves and Geneva gowns; when she found fault with the solid meat, and demanded sweet cakes. They punished her, tasked her, im prisoned her, never inhumanly, always with a quiet, methodical regard to what they considered her health and strength. They wondered why she did not improve ; they feared she was about to vindi cate after all the hot, reckless line of which she was come. They complained with truth, that she was not grateful for the trouble she cost them, since"], [379, "The Life of Sense and Heaviness. 367 they could not term gratitude those fits of sorrow and remorse, and outbursts of inconsistent, incohe rent affection with which she came creeping to their feet, and kissing their hands, and looking up at them with her large, lustrous eyes, after her pets, \u2014 these demonstrations only plagued and distressed them. The dwellers in the house by the river could not have afforded their visitor much pleasure without departing altogether from the stern mould of their life, and that could not have been expected of them. They allowed themselves almost no relaxation. They cared for nothing but the glorious Revolution and the pure Reformation, and an honest and dili gent life. They did not even make William's ex ceptions with regard to hunting and fighting. The head of the house was old and heavy, and could not ride furiously, and the wars were over. But they were as silent as William, and I fear, I fear, they would as phlegmatically and without a dream of sensuality have eaten up all the dish of pease from a Queen Mary or a Princess Anne of a third party. There was but one amusement which the house fairly commanded, and that was the river, and to that the stranger girl took with an intense addic tion. Its pageants, as she called them, were like old home scenes and native air to her. She relished them, and she would, had she been permitted, have sat hours looking out on the ripple and wavelet, the summer-houses and landing-places, and above all on"], [380, "368 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. the perpetual passage of every description of com pany. Her glued-together lips sprang asunder ; her cold hands acquired a soft warmth, her eyes beamed, and from her mouth there burst a faint echo of the old blithe laughter. The dame forbade that waste of time, at first inci dentally, as an interference with becoming employ ment, then strictly as a penance, then austerely as a contradiction to her will, which she would not suffer \u2014 as the strain of contest between herself and her graceless, profitless niece. The child coaxed, begged, resisted furiously, defied the interdict, feigned to submit, and was treated as a cheat and a liar. It was such a small matter of contention, such a small, small mat ter ; and yet such a weight hung on its silken thread. The girl moped, sat with her face to the wall ; her olive colour grew green to ghastliness ; the white of her eye-balls looked blue by contrast, a film spread over the pupils. \" Madam,\" said one of the young daughters of the house, in an anxious voice, \" I am frightened for Saccharissa, the deprivation will kill her ; rather give in on such a trifle. I cannot understand why it should occasion her grief and despair, but with draw your opposition, and I will sit with her my self at the river window, and see that she stitches the bands.\" \" Never, Dorcas ; it is pampering her folly."], [381, "The Life of Sense and Heavinesi . 369 Grief and despair, forsooth ! A vile temper and a wanton mind. Yield to her lust for show and noise, and she will have enough of the river before all is done.\" \" Enough of the river.\" Was that prophetical ? Macaulay recalls a tale of shame and woe in connexion with a Quaker household two hundred years ago ; and he has been censured for the ruth lessness with which he has prosecuted his study of moral anatomy. There is no one to be pained by my scanty exposure of a nameless victim ; and, besides, the family story was closely hushed up at the time, \u2014 only a few whispers got about of madness and self-destruction, of dabbled feet and draggled hair, and a little pouting mouth, cold and wan, defiled with mud and clay. The doctors said something of the spleen, of the brain irt a state of excitement, of constitutional disease. There was a grave and decorous fune ral, trembling, writhing women being all in the background, behind closed shutters and pulled down window-blinds. I daresay they were recon ciled in time to the unlooked-for tragedy by their good intentions. I can fancy that they would shake off their horror in their sense that they had done everything for the best ; and the doctors had stated there was hereditary disease, and a highly excited condition of the brain. Far be it from me to take it upon me to pretend that they had no right to the solace. I would only ask the 2 A"], [382, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 370 calm, sedate members of society to be humble, and admit there are things in the world never dreamt of in their philosophy ; to be pitiful and tender, lest, for some little matter, some very little matter, some repudiation of God's lights of nature and art, song and story, blossom of flower, and carol of bird, He asks of them \u2014 \"Where is thy sister, thy sensitive, impulsive sister, whom by a little concession you might have saved, but whom by a great denial you destroyed ?\""], [383, "CHAPTER IV. THE LIFE OF SARCASM AND BITTERNESS. There is another life to which the few, not the many, respond, and that is the life of sarcasm and bitterness. In this world, where there is so much that is absurd, in opposition to upright prin- ciples, good judgment, correct taste, not to say the highest authority, it is sometimes hard not to snarl, if we are too conscientious and benevolent on the whole to sneer. Really it seems sometimes not a very unchristian act to turn upon our neigh- bours, and barb any arrows of scorn and derision which we possess, and shoot them off one after another, until we have pierced their callousness, and caused them to desist from their offences. We have done them good. Why should they distrust and detest us for ever afterwards ? But just because they will do so, is sufficient evidence that irony is a weapon that can only be profitably used at a wide reach, and on rare occasions. Our .171"], [384, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. --jr. ot 2 neighbour may be more sensible since we galled him; but if he is more malicious, we have injured instead of benefiting him. They say, \" those who live in glass houses should not fling stones.\" Now, we all live in glass houses, and, not from a selfish regard for our own safety, but from sheer modesty, we ought to be harmless as summer lightning in our strictures. The poison of folly and wrong-headedness cours ing in our neighbour's veins is in our own, only it may have come out in another shape ; and perhaps our fellows are even now regarding its ebullitions and excrescences with a rage and contempt very similar to our own. But, any way, it is certainly there. So we should be tender and merciful, whether we are merry or wrathful ; and this very quality of tenderness and mercy is what distin guishes bland humour from its savage brother, wit. Who would say that Addison had not a perception of the oddities and errors of his contemporaries ? Who would imagine that Shakspere was deficient in the observation of the world around him ? Yet, compare the large-hearted charity of him who was called \" gentle Willy,\" and the Christian courtesy of Mr. Spectator, with the venom of Pope and Dryden and the terrible Dean ! and how much was society improved by their spite, while they them selves formed mere units in its thousands ? Where are many of the customs, and all the poor flesh and-blood foes on whom they wreaked their yen-"], [385, "The Life of Sarcasm and Bitterness. 373 geance ? Gone ; dead and gone. And so much of the genius which might have enlightened and sustained us for ages, wasted on these temporary hatreds. In women, vivacity was wont to be a standard charm, and, between ourselves, I think it is so still. I believe a great many ofthe descriptions of women, attractive from their shyness, abstraction, pensiveness, are- \u2014 well, descriptions ! At least, I prize the lively women of good old fiction and biography; not the rattles, but the cordial, shrewd, sensible, though often prejudiced or partial women, like Lizzie Bennet. (How proud and pleased I was when I first heard of Archbishop Whately's review of Miss Austen's novels !) I like my women to be practical, and sometimes brilliant ; and on that account I make great allowance for the trenchant tongues of those mighty independent dames and spinsters of Dean Ramsay's, for the sake of their raciness. But I must confess that, with women, the weapon of sharpness, not to say bitterness, is a dangerous tool, apt to be bad for their acquaintances, and often very bad for themselves. It might be otherwise, when greater freedom of speech was licensed ; but now women have unanimously agreed to detest the person who takes them off, more than the person who deceives them. They prefer treachery to sarcasm. It may be a part of their timidity, their defective sense of justice, as men will have it ; but they cannot away"], [386, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 374 with the lip curled and the laugh raised at their expense ; they cannot endure it in the present, or forgive it in the past. Such a horror have they of this faculty or propensity, that, in my own experi ence as a woman, I have heard the most inoffensive, and \u2014 not to put a fine point upon it \u2014 the most in capable women unhesitatingly accused of the in sult ; and, without a trial, blackballed for it on the moment and for ever from friendly circles. I have known excellent, kindly, amusing women shunned habitually and persistently for indulging in the play but a little. Now, it is not a wholesome thing to dislike or be disliked, unless where it cannot be avoided ; and when those who should be of the same flock with us commence to ruffle up their feathers, utter shrill cries, and either run away, or else set on us with beak and claws, the consequences are exciting, but they are not improving. An innocent drag of good-humoured protest put on silliness, is with drawn, and a drag all jagged with rough and cruel edges substituted in its place. The very effects presupposed are produced ; the sarcastic woman waxes self-conceited and sour. Deal with sarcasm, then, very sparingly, and with a very loving lightness. You know you are bound, inasmuch as lieth in you, to live peaceably with all men. On that account, do not be swift to fling down the challenge of biting gibes, or there will never be peace again for you. I should be"], [387, "The Life of Sarcasm and Bitterness. 37 5 sorry to spoil your archness or your sprightliness. I have a natural abhorrence to a mawkish, sleepy headed, or sly girl, who will not give her opinion, much more from the fear of getting into a scrape, or from sheer stupidity, than from wisdom or gentle ness ; but I do not see that you must needs be per verted into cowardly or cunning girls, by refraining from acerbity, or sweetening it until it becomes an agreeable tonic, rather than a kind of meat or drink to set the teeth on edge and rasp the throat. For your comfort, I can tell you that many of the live liest and cleverest women who have ever existed have been the most agreeable, considerate, tolerant, patient, and hopeful. They have been like sun shine in their families, and sunshine in their circles, nothing noxious lingered within their light. I can refer you again to the example in Proverbs, where the same model woman who opened her mouth with wisdom, had on her tongue the law of kindness. THE THIRD ROOM. It was a room to the water again, but it was no longer overhanging the river, it was comparatively retired, and the company who occupied it were more engrossed with themselves and each other than with the procession before them. They glanced out occasionally to catch a suggestion whereon to hang a"], [388, "376 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. witticism, or a simile wherewith to point a re partee ; but they were sufficient for themselves, they needed no foreign element for their entertain ment. These were but two or three ghostly spe cimens of the strongly-coloured wits of Anne's court ; wits, who could never bring a ruby of bril liance from the mouth of Anne with the chestnut curls, or fat George with the great periwig. Men and women alike rouge talons, with gold and silver clocks in their stockings, feathered hats, camlet coats and waistcoats, and little muffs distributed very impartially among them ; \u2014 men who wore the Bolingbroke-tie ; women who showed a copy of Lady Mary's snuff-box from Moorsields \u2014 Mall, or St James's. The party had prints, manuscript verses, and cards before them, with Turkey coffee and claret. To do them justice, they confined themselves prin cipally to the prints and the poems. They dealt with them in an insolent way. Insolence was their forte ; a story was told of a country parson who had stumbled amongst them, and, after listen ing to their talk, could not resist the astounding exclamation, \" Good people, do you live by your insolence ? \" Satire was the breath of their nos trils ; nothing was thought of, if it was not satirical. The great poets' grand diction and magnificent imagery would have been nothing without the stabs which they inflicted liberally. That audience cared little for the Ode to St. Cecilia's day, or the"], [389, "The Life of Sarcasm and Bitterness. 377 Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady ; but it adored Absalom and Ahithophel, and the Dunciad. These individuals would sacrifice anybody, any thing, the dearest friend they possessed, to a clever saying. A sentence so savage, an epigram so neat in its contempt, that London would ring with it, would make any one of them turn his or her back on the others for ever. How the critics handled the verses before them ! Some of them were jaundiced, leering, snarling : those they treated with respect ; at least they read them, luxuriated in them, found no fault with their horrible misanthropy, their loathsome selfishness. Others were hackneyed and stilted enough, but with a kind of fantastic meandering over milder, meeker ideas. These they attacked with the scalping-knife and the tomahawk, and despatched, without quarter, with a vindictive triumph, a blighting irony. It was not that they had no sympathy with the human feelings, no interest in the humanity which the weak lines expressed ; but they were like Anglo-Indians fed on curry alone. They could not commit themselves either, by betraying any weakness before each other. These literary men and women had to live con stantly on their guard, as an American squatter against a fellow -squatter's bowie-knife. Lynch law was openly proclaimed by them to the death. The company indulged in scandal vile enough sometimes, but still it was to expedite a glittering"], [390, "378 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. innuendo, to warrant a shrewd judgment. Scandal did not form the staple of their conversation ; they did not batten on it like those fair women, and loose cavaliers of Charles's era, but as we derive our diamonds from carbon, and our amethysts from clay, they used an ugly foundation for their scintil lating gems. At a reasonably early hour the buckram-skirted coats, and gowns \"all of a curl,\" vanished to some later drum, or rout, or turn at Ranelagh. The mis tress of the house sat alone among her patches and paste, and the last dedications which had solicited her patronage and crowned her with reflected honour. As she leant back in her chair, and held up her thin foot to the fire, the writing on a humble letter addressed to her, caught her eye. She touched her handbell for her weary woman, Betty. \" Did Master Giles or his sister call again to day ? \" \" Yes, my lady,\" answered Betty, sparing in her words ; never gossiping when she could help it, with that cold, brilliant mistress. \" Well, well, they will call again to-morrow, like the newsman, or the chairman, or the linkman, or any other attentive servant.\" \" No,\" escaped from Betty's lips, half un awares. \" And why not, mistress ? \" demanded her lady sharply. \" Because he said he had given up his poetry,"], [391, "The Life of Sarcasm and Bitterness. 379 and was gone back to his apprenticeship, and she told me she had got a place for herself as nursery maid at the squire's.\" \" Fools,\" declared the patroness, scornfully, \" and this is all their gentle breeding has brought them to ?

In stead of that, he had them served back to him minced into morsels, and drenched with pepper and vinegar.

And what was Mistress Malapert's complaint ? I'm sure I had her up and praised her patterns, and their execution.\" \" Oh, please, my lady, she could not stand it"], [392, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 380 \u2014 your other observations, though I told her, they were only your way.\" \" You are a Oueen of Sheba, my girl. What did I say ? \" in her flippant-company tone now, tossing back her head, and looking straight before her with her saucy eyes, expecting to be amused by the dis comfiture of her protegees at her own keen shafts, darted with a coward's aim into defenceless birds. \" That it was not her heels which were red like the ladies of quality, but her claws or paws ; that her thick voice made you palate of Yorkshire pudding.\" \" Very good ; I wish I had said them to a roomful of hearers. Go, Betty.\" \" They have saved me some trouble,\" mused the witty lady again, nursing her knees and toast ing her toes ; \" these clodpoles, with their fine feelings. They had a claim upon me, the son and daughter of the man who carried through my father's lawsuit for nothing. He was paid for it in reputation, but he did not live to coin money out of his character. They might have been useful to me if they had remained near me ; they seemed modest and intelligent, absurd as they have proved themselves ; and they looked like creatures who would have been grateful. But I vow no one can endure an idle observation, or a lively retort, save we wits, who are inured to it. Sure, it breaks no bones. There was my brother's widow.

He held my part in that false story of my friend Lady Bell's ; I know she made it, because her brain was dry, and she must wag her tongue to freshen it. Dick's widow could do nobody any harm. She was as silly as a piping canary ; but she would have it that I poked my finger at her weeds and her affliction, because I said she had changed herself into a lackadaisacal, sooty, town sparrow ; and she went away from me and got into debt and difficulties, and died, spent with shame and terror, on her way to the Fleet, where they were carrying her, to frighten her into applying to me or some other friend. By all the world, it was like a piping canary disagreeing with its proposed cage, and dashing its head against the wires beforehand. I am low to-night ; I must have my drops. Quick, Betty \u2014 cart-horse, snail ! \u2014 my drops ! \" What ! low ? \u2014 that dashing, many-sided woman low in her luxurious room, on her stately bed !

'HE LIFE OF SELF-SACRIFICE. There is still a life to which a young girl, or her friends for her, may turn, and that is a life of self-sacrifice, a resolute denial of all ease, grace, and gladness, and as zealous an adoption of hard, painful work, and meagre fare and furniture, as if she were a cloistered nun of the strictest order. It may appear strange that there should be any objection to it, when we stand commanded by the Apostle to present our bodies a living sacrifice to the Lord who bought us ; but it strikes me that this is a dead sacrifice, inasmuch as it is a dead ness not only to all the sins, but to all the bless ings with which we are surrounded. Yet there can be no doubt that there is a severe sym metry about this life, a unity and completeness, which the lives before it want. For all that, it does not seem the life which God, who claims from us \" a reasonable service,\" and who Himself giveth us all things richly to enjoy, intended for his crea- 3Si"], [395, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice . 383 tures. By its fearful reactions, its terrible dis orders, which those who will study medi\u00e6val life may ascertain for themselves, and by the Apostle's human counsel, we are, I think, solemnly warned against it. But so different are human natures in their requirements and conditions, and so superior is this straightforward devotion, to the by-ways of heaviness, levity, and bitterness, that I would never venture to prescribe to any girl or woman how far it must extend. I would only state, gently, with what it should have nothing to do. Whatever you choose to renounce in order to spread the gospel, or provide for the poor, you must not renounce the catholic spirit of religion. A religion of sectarianism is but a fragment of religion, and if not cemented again to the main building will soon crumble to ruins. It is a beauti ful, hopeful, consoling truth that holiness is the development of humanity ; and you who, by a peculiar self-dedication, have, to a certain extent, separated yourself from ordinary humanity, must be very careful to preserve all its instincts entire. You must not lose your sympathies with your race ; you must never forget that you have no reason to suppose that others have received the same call with yourselves to resign all that is bright and joyous, in order to work righteousness. If you are sisters of charity, let charity be your watch word ; not alms - deeds but tenderness ; else the strange anomaly will be seen of a noble woman"], [396, "384 Papers for Thoughtful Girls who can be a nurse in an hospital, or a teacher and guide in a house of refuge, but who is a petri sication among simple, fanciful, weak, loving wives and mothers, sisters and daughters. Shun bigotry as you would shun sin. It is the spirit of the Pharisees who slew your Master ; it is a hard, haughty, unholy state of mind. It is the letter of religion which killeth, while the spirit maketh alive. One must ponder much the deep things of God ; not only acts of duty, but that mystery of mercy which stands face to face with the mystery of ini quity\". One must think of God as the God of love. Be content to be inactive sometimes, to stand and wait ; a great and good woman, earnest in works, has given in her testimony, that waiting is, in all probability, the best attitude for perfecting the Christian character. We all know it is a hard enough one to flesh and blood. Oh, be gentle, you who have the constancy of martyrs, whom we women are proud to honour as leading our van in good deeds ! Let us who respect you so highly, who love you so honestly, not have always to defend you from the reproach of being grim, good women, chilling by your grey tone, cutting by your sharp ice, to the mere exu berance of animal and intellectual life.

You say im patiently, we require more of you than is human. Yes, because you have adopted a more than human career. There are careers more, as there are careers less than human ; you serve a Master more than human ; you have come forward and asked, like the rich young man, \" What shall I do ?\" not \" to be saved,\" but to advance thy kingdom, and the answer is still, \" Sell all that thou hast ;\" let every jot and tittle of thy weakness be laid down, \" and come, take up thy (individual) cross, and follow me.\" I think we say it advisedly, that a gust of passion sweeping down a great man or woman's barriers, and laying such a one prostrate and humbled before God and man, is less injurious to the cause we all wish to live and die in, than an easy, confident, half-defiant display of an indiscreet, unbecoming freak or folly in his or her ordinary walk and conversation. I need scarcely add, that those who take up such a peculiar life must have a distinct perception of rare gifts. We would surely not be less careful 2 B"], [398, "386 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. than our Roman Catholic brethren, who seek to dis cover a vocation for the cloister. To rush rashly, out of pique or desire after change or morbid vanity, into such a high, clear, rarefied atmosphere, is the height of presumption, which cannot expect to go unpunished any more than the rude audacity of the men of Israel, who placed their undaunted hands on their sacred ark, upon the plea of promoting the security of its progress. THE FOURTH ROOM. It was the plainest, simplest room in the house. It mattered little whether it looked on the water or no, for the old river was walled in with warehouses, the water was foul with slime, and for the gay, gilded wherries, there were grimy coal barges. The room wanted the painted ceiling and carved scrolls on the pannels, which some people like still. Its one advantage was, that it was lined with cup boards, and that was a great convenience to one who kept bales of cloth and sacks of meal, and who counted every fraction of her time, and answered for it to herself as to a merciless judge. Even the saving of a few minutes in traversing stairs and passages was something to her. The locality of the house was still a good one for its tenant. It was no longer fashionable ; it"], [399, "The Life of Self -Sacrifice. 387 was in the centre of warehouses and public offices, but it was sufficiently near to St. Giles', and it was a quiet, safe residence for those who had scruples on that head, and a right to insist on them. She with whom we have to do had none for herself; where misery abode was her dwelling ; she had no fears, none; she had steeled herself against such weaknesses ; she had accustomed hand, and eye, and voice to scenes of wretchedness, degrada tion, and filth, until they never faltered. She appeared to have no more nerves than a statue. Where cholera had shot its pangs, where low typhus \"had moaned its ravings, among thieves and fallen women, she had walked with a light foot, and lent her aid with a firm hand. For the old brocades and jewels, the stomachers and the rouge talons, the costume now was a wrap ping-gown of lilac calico ; calico because it washed, and lilac was a fast colour. A wide apron, a close cap, and on the door hung the black cloak and bonnet, which could be worn at all seasons, and in all places. Yet to me Elizabeth was one of the fairest of women. A woman, not a girl ; a woman in her mature years. Elizabeth \u2014 and as I write the name, I think of another Elizabeth far off in time, far off in race, but so like, that it seems wonderful that she should have worn her crown of thorns in vain for other Elizabeths in all generations. This Elizabeth, I cannot tell what her charm is ; it is not in complexion or feature, or hands or feet."], [400, "388 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. No, that reads like sacrilege ; it is in a pure, blessed face; the face of an erring woman, but half divine. It seems to me that those who do angels' work, have sometimes angels' faces. Elizabeth was going abroad on her daily work, and scarcely a city doctor, a city missionary, how ever benevolent, however devoted, had more toil some, trying, fearful rounds to overtake. But first she did a methodical, business-like thing; she read her heap of morning letters, official letters, letters conveying invoices, letters asking her advice, letters containing petitions, solid, short commercial letters, ill-spelt letters, letters ill-folded, sealed with wafers and clogs of wax, one little, delicate, scented letter, with a coat of arms on the envelope, and the address in violet ink, in a clear, flowing hand. Elizabeth kept that last ; she even took notes of some of the others, and jotted down answers before she turned to this one, and yet there was no absence of love on her lips and in her eyes when she did so. \" My queen, Matilda, little pussy-cat, Matty, remembers her nurse.\" As she read, her brow knit, and her lips trembled. \" I cannot, Matty ; I cannot. Your husband may be roving, fond of excitement ; the old story of the hunting, yachting, club-life retained after the young wife thinks he ought to content himself with a canter on the smooth turf by her side, a pleasure-sail at Weymouth, a cup of tea in her drawing-room. You may not manage properly, but I should only"], [401, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 389 be an interloper in your house. You chose your portion, sister Matty, and I chose mine ; we must abide by our choice. I will love you, pray for you, care for you in sickness : but to go and live with you in health, to attend to your whimsical griev ances and sentimental distresses ! \u2014 see, I am crying for them, Matty, while I am calling them hard names, \u2014 and give up my suffering, ignorant poor, who are the particular charge of the rich, enlight ened, unencumbered like me ! that cannot be. I cannot even afford space to regret it this morning, for there is a particular message from the hospital, and I must go there first, and take that into my list.\" Away went Elizabeth, walking very quietly though quickly, picking her steps very cleverly, carrying her bag very well poised ; for she was no dreamer, but a very well-instructed, capable woman, who had studied her arts of doctoring, ministering, teaching, under very wise, very earnest, very humble teachers, and if they had granted degrees, Elizabeth would have carried off a high one. She was not a fanatic or an enthusiast, in the ordinary sense of the terms. I hope you may be pardoned the thought, if it has crossed your imagi nation, but such a woman as Elizabeth was no evil coquette under the guise of a sister of charity, no vain, empty-headed, empty-hearted, passion-pos sessed woman, a wolf in sheep's clothing among the honest, sensible, pitiful nurses, for the sake of her own miserable adventures. It ss no abiding"], [402, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 390 stain on the band, that they have numbered such wretched recruits, when even the company of the apostles included a Judas. This was a true woman, and a noble ; stern to herself and her own flesh and blood, tender to humanity, desiring to spend her little day of rank, wealth, and pomp, in the blood, sweat, and dust ofthe battle-field. The officials of the hospital received her plea santly, as one known and respected, exchanged a word or two with her ; but it was one ofthe pecu liarities of this service, that all were so busy in their several places, they could not waste much time in sympathy and cordiality. It might be heartier what they had of it, but the servants at these posts had acquired a concise manner on duty which admitted of little elaboration of intelligence, kindness, or humour. Very soon \u2014 so soon, you would scarcely believe that she had left her cloak and bonnet in the matron's room, and received a report from a doctor \u2014 Elizabeth walked up one of those lanes of low, white pallet-beds, with tossed or languid limbs, and hairy, haggard faces, some sullen, some wistful \u2014 the male ward in an hospital. She was called to see a man who had sustained an accident in the erection of a building the day before, \u2014 a mason fallen from a scaffolding, hurt in the chest dangerously.

These were the gleanings on which Elizabeth was summoned to act. The communication interested her ; she had seldom such a patient ; she had been dealing lately with the stupid and the brutal in every way, men and women with scarcely the traits, scarcely the dialect of civilized humanity. She believed she pitied them more ; she would have declared that ima gination had nothing to do with her business ; but all the more, because she trampled upon it, ima gination sprang up to meet any good. He was lying with his face turned from her, so that he did not remark her approach as other than that of the nurse of his ward. He was unshaven, and his hair was tossed about and matted together. He was panting with pain, and a feeling of strange depression new and startling to him. His hands were big and clumsy, tanned and hacked, though no longer soiled with sand ; and you might have half-guessed his trade by a notch across his thumb nail, to which he had constantly pressed his measur ing-line. His forehead was broad ; his eyes deep set ; his mouth \u2014 you could not tell its character now, it was so relaxed ; but there was a trembling about the lips and nostrils that indicated nerves \u2014 nerves in the working man that were not the nerves of the working lady.

Is there anything I can do for you ? \" He started, and turned and gazed at her. \" I am a nurse,\" she explained, \" at your service.\" \" Not a nurse like her!\" he stammered incre dulously, indicating the professional nurse giving drink to a patient a few beds off. \" I am not so good in one way. I am not always at this duty. I am an amateur ; a volun teer nurse. Men don't trust volunteers as they do regular soldiers.\" He smiled a little, but he never took his eyes from her face. You may excuse him ; he had never seen any person in the least resembling her. \" But I can give you a drink, and shake up your pillow almost as well as she can ; and I can read to you better, for I have been early taught that duty.\" \" I should like to hear you read.\" \" Very well ; I shall begin immediately, and you will tell me when you are tired. I shall read the lesson for the day, and then some verses which"], [405, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 393 I like. I believe you like verses too, because they found them in your jacket.\" He bit his lip at that, and frowned, as if an noyed, with a quick sense of irritation ; but he drank in her melodious voice, and he never took his eyes from her, from her bent throat, her clear con tour, her shapely hands, her eyes so soft, and yet so penetrating, raised occasionally to acquaint her self with his state. I think her dress helped to cast a glamour over him. Had she worn the con ventional dress of a lady, the conventional distinc tions between them would have struck him, prob ably offended him. Your proud poor man is apt to revolt at class attributes ; but Elizabeth's was the dress, which might have been the dress of his sister or wife, only refined, as if an angel wore it. Once she stopped and lifted his head on her arm and arranged it in greater ease. He was quite passive in her hands ; he received all she did ; he did not even thank her, but when she had done, he said suddenly \u2014 \" I have a request ; it is foolish, they ain't worthy, but will you read these once to me as you have read the rest ? \" and he put his hand below his pillow and pulled out some crumpled papers, where they had left them at his wish. (The poet may be pardoned like the man, and he had a true poet's instinct to distinguish the tones of a voice, and the secrets they contain.) \" The fist is shocking bad,\" he said, apologetically, \" but there"], [406, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 394 was a-many of us in Manchester, and I had only the night-school,\" he concluded, with a sigh. \" It is a bad hand,\" she said, in her perfect frankness, which never gave offence, \" but it is legible, and that is the main thing.\" The verses were no better than such verses usu ally are ; fitful, irregular, with boorish blunders, and again with naive beauties to those who love lyric poetry, like the wind among the barley, the water among the rushes, the wave on the shore, the cry of the lapwing, the call of the cuckoo, anything, everything wild, natural, sweet. She threw herself into them ; she could not help that ; it was her nature. That was the reason why she was so good a reader, so good a nurse ; but it was her bane as well as her blessing. She noticed how red he got, and how he held his labour ing breath. \" I am afraid I am doing you harm ? \" \" Oh no ; but I have been too bold ; they are not fit for a lady like you ; you don't like them.\" \" But I do like them ; they are not verses of the schools, still they have both fancy and feeling ; things I used to think a great deal about, and you will think about them when you 're well again ; you will cultivate your talent, and find great delight in it.

I daresay it is not agreeable ; you must forgive me. You see it is convenient ; we could never manage here with so many regular addresses, and we don't always have them at first. Would you care about telling me your name ? \" \" They call me Jem,\" he replied, rather gruffly. \" Thank you, Jem ; the name is a great deal nicer. I will come back to-morrow and see you again, if you want me. I have a great many places to go to to-day. Good-bye. I hope you'll mend soon. She left him, raised on his elbow looking after her. Elizabeth had a misgiving, \u2014 the first she had ever experienced in her calling. She went directly with it to the chaplain, who was her parti cular friend in the institution. I don't mean that Elizabeth was like that other Elizabeth, bound under a different name to the ordinance ofthe con fessional, or that she had the least idea of resigning the right of private judgment ; but, like many good men and women, particularly those who are sen sible that they have lively imaginations, though they whip them soundly, and thrust them into dark holes every day of their lives, \u2014 those who are conscientious to a degree, \u2014 she was prone to rest"], [408, "396 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. on the righteous judgment of another on whom she could safely rely. It was such a relief to her ; she did not see how she could accomplish her heavy, harassing work without putting herself to a great extent under a leader, and conforming in general to his rules. And I cannot see how any woman could do what she did without electing and acknowledg ing a chief. Individual effort in so great a field must either have had something of the super natural, or must have been altogether wasted. \"Mr. Sale,\" she said, \"this is not a common patient ; he made me read out verses of his own, and it excited him.\" \" What kind of verses \u25a0? \" \" Oh, the usual verses about nature, and soli tude, and a great Being, vague and confused, and what you would call pantheistic, though I dare say he never heard the word ! I said I would return to-morrow, and I would like to keep my promise ; but I will not see him afterwards, if you think I had better not.\" \" Did he seem to listen to you ? had you any effect upon him ?\" \" Yes ; I think so. I believe he liked my read ing ; being a woman, and educated, I suppose I in vested it with a charm to him ; just as his poetry had a charm to me, because it was so natural.\" \" Go back, by all means. These superior work ing fellows, with their minds rude and out of pro portion, are sometimes the worst for us to deal"], [409, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 397 with, and the easiest for women like you. They have mountains of prejudices, but thev melt to such as you. This is the very case for you. I cannot you tell the good you may do that poor fellow; or how you may elevate and soften him.\" Mr. Sale was a good man, as good a man as ever breathed ; but he was a Scavola ; he would have dashed his own right hand into the middle of the fire to fulfil his mission. Perhaps that was the reason why he had very little hesitation in thrusting the right hands of others straight among the burning brands ; or he might be less wise in his generation than the children of this world. Surely, in the plainest, most prosaic terms, there was danger to somebody in drawing thus closely to gether, in such circumstances, a gifted mart and an attractive woman ; though they were of widely different ranks, they were of the same clay after all. Why should the charity which thinketh no evil wilfully blind itself to human nature ? And why did this man, who made it the business of his life to instruct human nature, and who was con stantly recurring to its first principles, calmly ignore them when they were as clear as noon day ? Not a score of years ago, a ship sailed to the Southern Ocean and deposited in one of its islands the nucleus of a company of preachers ; a group of men who perished of cold and hunger long be fore the return of an English vessel to aid and"], [410, "398 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. cheer them. They died in a heroic cause ; they died like heroes, rather like saints ; but the whole enterprise is reported to have been planned and carried through, in total disregard to natural laws and the dictates of prudence and common sense, by those who were seeking to serve the very God who ordained the laws of nature, and who bade men be wise as serpents, as well as harmless as doves. After that recommendation, Elizabeth went regularly to the hospital, and took the state of Jem's head and heart, as far as possible, on her own shoulders. He was always very glad to see her, while he was the most respectful patient she had ever tended. He was communicative to her, though he was reserved to others. He told her how the \" a-many of them in Manchester\" had been swept off by one of the malignant fevers that followed hard in the wake of short-time and de- pressed wages, and how he alone had been left. He had no friends but the family with whom he lodged, and they knew of his accident and his whereabouts, and he did not think it right to trouble them fur- ther. He confided to her his struggles after en- lightenment, and the fact that they had produced a .disparity between him and his associates, and pre- vented him caring to forge for himself nearer ties ; and so she acquired a notion of his tastes, and lightened his sickness by gratifying them. In return she talked, in her gentle, unpretending way, of places and persons she had seen, and"], [411, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 399 things she had done ; and more incidentally, but with far more powerful effect, of articles of faith, and sources of hope she cherished as her greatest treasure. His homely language did not offend her ; she had been more used to it lately than to any other, and his thoughts were not low. After the sordid, gross expressions she had listened to for along while, his sincere, simple, clumsy efforts after what was high and pure sounded very noble to her ; and she had been accustomed to accommodate herself to persons removed from her by artificial distinctions. She had made it her especial study to be courteous to all men. He did not recover quickly or satisfactorily. His chest was hurt, and his lungs bled. The doctors could not tell when he would \" be about\" and able for his work again, they could not ven ture to say that he would ever be perfectly restored from the effects of the accident, but he was in no present danger. He was contented to lie there ; he had never been in such an atmosphere, never pictured to himself such companionship, as he had for an hour or two every day. I have said it was as if an angel came to visit him, and left him to brood over her messages. She did not weary of her work ; no doubt it had its fascination for her. The only drawback was, that other occupations became distasteful to her, and gradually the whole bent of her heart and soul"], [412, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 400 settled in this one office, which Mr. Sale had as sured her was peculiarly in her hands. She per ceived this falling away ; she had not so long examined herself and tried herself for it to escape her. It vexed her extremely ; she attributed it to selfishness, partiality, inconsistency. She said to herself she would work it down. Anything but that, Elizabeth ; because such a cure for pining, yearning, mutual attraction is im possible. You may wear out flesh and blood, but you will not work out human nature in its pith and marrow. In the old quality-house, with its ghosts of departed joys, and sorrows, and selfishnesses, existed what might have helped Elizabeth, what might have fed her intellect and affections by a hundred different channels, what might have roused her, diverted her, carried her away into the outer world, and with its first, full, healthy breeze ap prised her of the sickness which was hanging over her, stimulated her, and braced her to extricate herself and save him. She was enervated, and she worked harder and harder by way of antidote ; she was sick and faint, from a sudden conviction of the barrenness of her life, and an approach to human riches; and she starved herself more systematically, and confined herself more exclusively to the one purely womanly interest allowed in her existence. If she had read in that world of books ! but she merely touched them to seek out what would occupy and inform him. She had done with intel-"], [413, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 401 lectual excursions for herself; she had no time for them, and they seized upon her old intellectual nature too fixedly ; she had sunk the intellectual in the spiritual. If she had revived her old art predilections \u2014 she had once had such dreams of becoming an artist \u2014 she could once have so thrown herself into art ; but it was greater to be a Chris tian. Elizabeth could not comprehend that the two callings could be combined for her ; the whole world lying in wickedness, the misery of this great city of London, and she an independent, wealthy woman, of suitable years, playing with a pencil, and spending her leisure in hunting through gal leries and exhibitions, and executing a second-rate copy of an old master. Elizabeth could not abide it. If she had accepted some of the invita tions which her old acquaintances showered upon her, gone and relished polished society, received and imparted sympathy in the world's wide schemes, interested and been interested by the great and good in other walks of justice and mercy! If she had only responded to Matty's piteous, child ish entreaties, and been even engrossed by Matty's petty nuisances ! It was not that Elizabeth never had inclination to these things, that they did not rise before her, that she could not crave them, but that nearer and dearer to her was her version of the gospel; and that she thought she had chosen her part, and must abide by it. She could not serve two masters ; 2 c"], [414, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 402 she could not look back, she could not forsake her drunken washerwomen and charwomen, her deso late, thoughtless shop-girls, her poor, half-savage flower-girls\u2014 that the last association should exist ! her district of bricklayers, and scavengers, and paupers, she could not let them out of her sight for a moment. Thus Elizabeth walked miles and miles, sat on committees, taught in close, noisy, ragged schools, presided at meetings of helpless, obtuse, indolent women, electrified so far, that they had a desire to be made useful, but were not inclined to exert themselves, and had not determi nation to persevere, and were, when their common wretchedness did not unite them, mortally jealous of each other. Elizabeth fought to bring order out of disorder, to raise degraded humanity. She tried to manage that a certain number of parcels and pack ages should extend over a dispiritingly, bewilder ingly extensive number of claimants. What was probably the hardest task of all, she struggled to keep on terms and work in harmony with her com rades, among whom there were few Mr. Sales, far fewer Elizabeths. She swallowed her own meals all but standing, she slept the sleep of exhaustion. She did not work single-handed, and she worked in faith, but it was a terrible amount of labour, respon sibility, and anxiety for a single woman, and she had narrowed her oasis of refreshment in a desert of toil, literally to the hour or two with her patient and pupil in the hospital."], [415, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 403 The intercourse went on, as these things do go on, disastrously, heart-breakingly, until one day Elizabeth found Jem sitting up, as he was able to do then, with a very pale face. He told her that the doctors had agreed to dismiss him as cured for the present, or, at least, brought to the verge of their skill by way of recovery ; he was to leave the next day. , He looked at her as he said this ; he never spoke an unbecoming word to her in the whole course of their acquaintance ; he was not the man to do so ; she was not the woman to pro voke it. He never entertained a single delusive thought regarding her ; he did not even know why she turned away her head, unless it was because she was so good and kind. She could not bear to see him down-hearted, when he ought to be thank ful and cheery at quitting the hospital, and no longer being obliged to any one. It was unmanly, mean ; he was ashamed of himself \u2014 that he was. He could not tell what sorrow and despair were in his eyes ; but she read them, as one reads the telegram, which is to him the scroll written within and without with lamentation and woe. She asked him where he meant to go, and what he thought to do ; and he talked of carrying his tools to an old master builder in one of the northern counties, with whom he had served his apprentice ship, and who would give him work whenever he was fit for it, though it should be broken work thenceforth. In the meantime, he had his savings"], [416, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 404 \u2014 plenty of them ; so he said. He mentioned the train by which he expected to go, and he looked at her with an eager, thirsting expression. \" I will come to the station and speak a parting word to you, Jem,\" she said, with her old pleasant frankness ; \" and you must take a parting token from me \u2014 some books and other things ; yes, you must, Jem, for my sake.\" He did not refuse them, and she shortened her daily visit. She did not mean it; she might have guessed how grudgingly he would look at the clock after she was gone ; but she could not bear that agony of regret and self-reproach, that tide of pity and sympathy, and that smiting sense of a coming dreary blank. She went directly home, and sat, as she had not done for months, with her hands in her lap, gazing at the afternoon sun. Her servant girl (she took them in succession from her indus trial school, that they might learn cooking and housemaid's work, by poisoning her meals and marring her bed) wondered what had come over Miss Elizabeth ; surely she was fagged at last. Where Saccharissa pined, where the witty lady of Anne's day fretted, Elizabeth sat and suffered. She went out and bought several things, selecting them and carrying them home herself. They were not valuable, not out of keeping with her and him ; but so thoughtful, so tender in con sideration, such as women plan and purchase for fathers, sons, brothers, husbands. She returned,"], [417, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 405 and sat again looking at the sunset \u2014 an individual sunset fit to mark a day in a life ; the sun sinking in a sea of vapour, leaving behind it, over coal barges, wharves, and houses, a trail of brightness, shining in flakes of light, like the burnished feathers on the neck of a bird, or the glittering scales on a fish's side. Elizabeth regarded it longingly, linger ingly, as if it was to be her last sunset. It was the eve of her parting with one who might have been dear to her, who was dear to her. There was no other way ; if love, even dawning love, was strong as death ; so was habit. She was a woman to die for her class, to keep it free from stigma and stain with her own heart's blood ; and he, though he was but a working man, would not have injured her by the lightest breath. Elizabeth went punctually to the railway station next morning, and there he was, in his clean work ing clothes, with his workman's bundle in the handkerchief, and his mallet and chisels over his shoulder, in no manner different from other work ing men, unless in being one of nature's gentlemen. She walked up straight to him, asked him how he felt, begged him to take care of himself, and, in a lower tone, hoped he would prosper. The people were getting into the train. Two o-entlemen were coming down the stairs, laughing loudly. The tone of one laugh struck Elizabeth's ear. .She held out her hand ; they were parting in"], [418, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 406 this world ; they shook hands once in their lives, and then she smiled and walked away. It was a repetition of the old, old scene, when Aria stabbed herself, and handed P\u00e6tus the dagger, with the words, \" P\u00e6tus, it is not painful.\" He had got into a carriage ; his heart was very sore, but he was trying to remember some of the lessons of patience and self-sacrifice which she had taught him, when his attention was caught by the conversation of the two laughing gentlemen, on the pavement at his side. \" I'll bet you anything she is a lady.\" \" And they shook hands.\" \" And you saw the fellow's look ; this comes of their philanthropy. I am sure her air is familiar to me. Yonder she is at the other end of the plat form. What do you say to give chase ?\" \" Done ; but we may lose the train.\" \" Oh, bother the train ; the train go hang !\" Jem's heart was sore before ; it was desperate now ; he sprang out. I believe his intention was to get between Elizabeth and these fine, merry gentlemen, and save her from annoyance. He jostled against the two as he pushed past them. \" What do you mean, fellow ? Keep off,\" cried one of the two, impatiently, giving a cut with his light switch across Jem's bare hand, as a noble duke struck a tailor on one of the great race grounds the other day. Jem was blind with sor row and fury ; the smart was enough to unman"], [419, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 407 him, and raise the devil in his place. He lifted his tools, and struck back a swinging blow at his antagonist, and the gentleman fell, with a heavy crash, at the working man's feet. Elizabeth was not so far off, but that she heard a cry and a scuffle. She turned round, and saw Jem's pale face convulsed with rage and grief, and his arms clutched by policemen and guards, held off from another group round a fallen object, which they had not yet succeeded in picking up from the ground. \" What has happened ? I know that man ; I can speak to his character.\" The official answered civilly, as they answer a lady plainly dressed, speaking quietly, though her lips are white. \" No use, ma'am. He has struck a gentleman with his tools, like a brute, as he is. The gentle man is half felled, insensible at all events, and bleeding like an ox. There, they are bringing him this way to the waiting-room. Don't you look, ma'am, in case it should turn you sick.\" But she did look ; she had seen many such sights ; notwithstanding, at this one, she tottered back, and sat down on a bench. She remained there, with the wind blowing on her, the people passing her, the train starting with its screech and rattle ; it could not stop for the gentleman, bruised and battered basely and wan tonly on the very public platform ; the circumstance"], [420, "408 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. simply formed an engrossing topic of conversation to the passengers. Of course Jem did not get speech of her to tell her how mad he had been, how sorry he was. He was taken away imme diately. She had but a dim vision of his wild face, with his workman's cap knocked off, and his hair blown over his forehead, as it had been tossed the first day she saw him. Another face was nearer her at this moment, ghastlier in its comeliness, more terrible in its unruffled stillness. At last some merciful man took note of her as a ladylike person, who had been overcome by the late shock, but who was giving no trouble, and making no noise about her agitation. \" He's coming round, ma'am, the gentleman as has been struck ; the doctor says he may do yet, though he's got a right smash.\" The tidings revived her ; she got up and replied, \" Will you be so good as to take me to the gentle man ? I can be of use to him now. Yes, I am acquainted with him ; he is my brother-in-law.\" Save for a misconception as to its cause, the trial was a fair one. The charge brought was to the effect that a working man had pushed roughly past a couple of gentlemen, hurrying along a rail way platform ; one of them had called out to the offender, and inflicted a small chastisement with a shade too much arrogance and haughtiness, and, in return, the mason had hit the defenceless man with a weapon which had inflicted a dangerous wound,"], [421, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 409 and had been within a hair's-breadth of causing his death. In spite of the disproportionate nature of the retaliation, there was no great malice evinced by the prosecutor ; in fact Matty's husband, hot blooded and light-natured as any Gaul, was not of the stuff which induces vindictiveness. He con ceived himself bound to prosecute, but he was sorry for the accident, particularly when he learned that the fellow concerned in it had been a patient of Elizabeth's. He did not wish to ruin him, though he held that the savage might be no worse of getting as good as he gave, lying in jail, while he lay in his bedroom, being condemned to the prison chaplain and prison diet, at least as long as he had to submit to a doctor's prescription, and a sick man's panada. Elizabeth was not summoned as a witness. She had not seen the encounter, and others, Mr. Sale particularly, bore testimony to the former good conduct of the prisoner. It was one of those unfortunate cases, where the very influences which on ordinary occasions operate favourably, combined to turn and act against the culprit. The evident moderation of the handsome young fellow with the pale face and bandaged head, the honesty with which he admitted that he had given provocation, the magnanimity with which he put aside his sufferings, rendered the offence so much the more heinous. The respectability and intelligence ofthe prisoner for one in his station in"], [422, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 410 life, the circumstance that he had that morning been discharged from an hospital, where his pains and wants had been amply attended to by the gene rosity and charity of the public which he had out raged, all proved how all-powerful and inveterate the proneness to acts of violence by which his class had lately disgraced itself, rendering the members of other classes victims to its ungoverned passions. Imprisonment for a year, with hard labour, seemed a mild enough sentence for an aggravated and alarm ing crime. Elizabeth went and saw Jem in prison, and was satisfied that, except for his pain at meeting her there, he was bearing his penalty with manly for titude, and with all the penitence which sprang up within him, in the torrent of thankfulness that he had been saved from the cruel wrong of fatally injuring her kinsman, and from the awful horror of committing murder. She depended upon Mr. Sale's providing for his future welfare ; for she was going into the country, sensible of the approach of illness in her own person. Elizabeth was living, languidly and sadly, that half invalid life which, to the brave and active, is one of the \"most trying bodily afflictions God can send them, when she received a summons to town. Mr. Sale wrote to her that her old patient, Jem, was dying in prison. His damaged chest had never righted itself from the consequences of his old acci dent ; it would probably have finished him sooner or"], [423, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 411 later; as it was, distress, confinement, prison disci pline, though they had been as gentle with him as their rules permitted, was summarily ending the con cern. Jem had a great desire to see his old nurse, and ask her forgiveness once again, and take farewell of her. He was not aware ofthe state of her health. Mr. Sale thought it was needless to pain him by the information, unless it presented an impediment to the fulfilment of the one little earthly prayer of the good, brave fellow. Yes, he was a good, brave fellow, in spite of his error. Mr. Sale must write it ; and lat terly it had been a pleasure and profit to guide him. Mr. Sale was certain that Elizabeth would comply with the entreaty, if it was within her power. I don't know whether Mr. Sale suspected that these two linked hands had been in the furnace, and what remained but to apply to their poor, scorched flesh such balm as he could command ? If so, I can vouch none would apply the salve more reve rently, with more noble liberality, and brotherly sympathy, and pitiful remorse. Elizabeth, broken as she was, complied without a doubt. That deathbed, amidst the bolts and bars, the chill order and grim precision, the galling restraint and withering mortification of a great city's prison, was not so dreary as you may imagine. That last interview was notably free from agitation. The man and woman, emaciated and wan, both of them, looked at each other with clear eyes, feeling that the invincible barriers between them were on"], [424, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 412 the brink of being dissolved, the fetters were severed and falling from the aching limbs, link by link. Could earth have done more for them ? Was not heaven kind ? He said he knew she would come to her patient ; he had never called himself anything else ; he thanked her for all she had been and done to him, as he had never thanked her in the hospital, and it was she who was silent now. Not silent all the time ; she read at his bidding, and as he had loved to hear her ; verses \u2014 his verses, the last he had made \u2014 noble verses these, worthy of immor tality ! \u2014 the Bible, their common chart; those chapters, which promise \"a glorious morrow;\" she prayed with him for the first and last time. She sat and held his hand for a long while before she was forced to go. I think he wished to die thus and then ; but it was not God's will, and it might not have been good for her. She heard- next morning that his spirit had passed peacefully during the night. And now that it stood unclothed before the throne of God, washed in the same blood which washes all the redeemed in glory, what did it matter whether, when in a taber nacle of clay, it had occupied the body of prince or peasant ? Her communion was as perfect with him now, as though they had been reared like brother and sister. But Elizabeth was a widowed woman while she remained in this world ; and I could almost pray"], [425, "The Life of Self-Sacrifice. 413 you may never know what that is, even with heavenly consolations. More than that ; in the days of her strength, Elizabeth had incautiously expended her all, lavished her faculties and powers on a goodly venture, and found herself worn and wasted, empty and exhausted, in her prime. She had not been content to lose her life, that she might save it ; but she had gone the road to wear her martyr's crown at high noon, and so to linger, faint and dying, though meek as a saint, and sing ing like a swan, till the shades of a premature evening closed kindly round her. Elizabeth of Thuringia began life in the splen dour of a court, with a princely lover, and ended it in a stripped and squalid cell, the tool of priests de-naturalized to demons. Elizabeth, this other Elizabeth, of her own free-will, started on a life of asceticism and labour ; but she could not put from her the romance of life which she had missed in her early days, when she encountered it at a later time in the face of every obstacle. We are fearfully and wonderfully made, and we cannot constitute ourselves anew, however highly expedient, and devoutly to be wished, such a pro cess may appear to us. Edinburgh : T.
