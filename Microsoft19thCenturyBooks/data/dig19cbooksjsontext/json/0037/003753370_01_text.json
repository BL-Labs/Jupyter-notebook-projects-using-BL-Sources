No one locality, outside of the county seat, calls for special elaboration, but many sections present about equal opportunities for comment. It is a cause of sincere regret to us, and will, no doubt, be to our readers, that the official papers and books of the several towns are no longer in existence. The pages here offered were prepared under serious difficulties, and are the product of much hard labor. If inaccuracies appear in them, the fault is not with the compiler, for every effort was put forth to secure correct data. The Western Historical Company extends its thanks to those who have so generously aided in the work of securing reliable information. The importance of the task here undertaken will be more fully realized and admitted in years to come, when time shall have added to the obstacles in the way of determining proper historic truth.

GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION. When the Northwestern Territory was ceded to the United States by Virginia in 1784, it embraced only the territory lying between the Ohio and the Mississippi Rivers, and north to the northern limits of the United States. It coincided with the area now embraced in the States of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and that portion of Minnesota lying on the east side of the Mississippi River. The United States itself at that period extended no farther west than the Mississippi River ; but by the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, the western boundary of the United States was extended to the Rocky Mountains and the Northern Pacific Ocean. The new territory thus added to the National domain, and subsequently opened to settlement, has been called the \"New Northwest,\" in contradistinction from the old \"Northwestern Territory.\" In comparison .with the old Northwest this is a territory of vast magnitude. It includes an area of 1,887,850 square miles ; being greater in extent than the united areas of all the Middle and Southern States, including Texas. Out of this magnificent territory have been erected eleven sovereign States and eight Territories, with an aggregate popula tion, at the present time, of 13,000,000 inhabitants, or nearly one third of the entire population of the United States. Its lakes are fresh-water seas, and the larger rivers of the continent flow for a thousand miles through its rich alluvial valleys and far stretching prairies, more acres of which are arable and productive of the highest percentage of the cereals than of any other area of like extent on the globe. For the last twenty years the increase of population in. the North west has been about as three to one in any other portion of the United States."], [18, "20 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. EARLY EXPLORATIONS. In the year 1541, DeSoto first saw the Great West in the New World. He, however, penetrated no farther north than the 35th parallel of latitude. The expedition resulted in his death and that of more than half his army, the remainder of whom found their way to Cuba, thence to Spain, in a famished and demoralized condition. DeSoto founded no settlements, produced no results, and left no traces, unless it were that he awakened the hostility of the red man against the white man, and disheartened such as might desire to follow up the career of discovery for better purposes. The French nation were eager and ready to seize upon any news from this extensive domain, and were the first to profit by DeSoto's defeat. Yet it was more than a century before any adventurer took advantage of these discoveries. In 1616, four years before the pilgrims \" moored their bark on the wild New England shore,\" Le Caron, a French Franciscan, had pene trated through the Iroquois and Wyandots (Hurons) to the streams which run into Lake Huron ; and in 1634, two Jesuit missionaries founded the first mission among the lake tribes. It was just one hundred years from the discovery of the Mississippi by DeSoto (1541) until the Canadian envoys met the savage nations of the Northwest at the Falls of St. Mary, below the outlet of Lake Superior. This visit led to no permanent result; yet it was not until 1659 that any of the adventurous fur traders attempted to spend a Winter in the frozen wilds about the great lakes, nor was it until 1660 that a station was established upon their borders by Mesnard, who perished in the woods a few months after. In 1665, Claude Allouez built the earliest lasting habitation of the white man among the Indians of the Northwest. In 1668, Claude Dablon and James Marquette founded the mission of Sault Ste. Marie at the Falls of St. Mary, and two years afterward, Nicholas Perrot, as agent for M. Talon, Governor Gen eral of Canada, explored Lake Illinois (Michigan) as far south as the present City of Chicago, and invited the Indian nations to meet him at a grand council at Sault Ste. Marie the following Spring, where they were taken under the protection of the king, and formal possession was taken of the Northwest. This same year Marquette established a mission at Point St. Ignatius, where was founded the old town of Michillimackinac. During M. Talon's explorations and Marquette's residence at St. Ignatius, they learned of a great river away to the west, and fancied \u2014 as all others did then \u2014 that upon its fertile banks whole tribes of God's children resided, to whom the sound of the Gospel had never come. Filled with a wish to go and preach to them, and in compliance with a"], [19, "21 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. MOUTH OP THE MISSISSIPPI. SOURCE OF THE MISSISSIPPI."], [20, "22 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. request of M. Talon, who earnestly desired to extend the domain of his king, and to ascertain whether the river flowed into the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Ocean, Marquette with Joliet, as commander of the expe dition, prepared for the undertaking. On the 13th of May, 1673, the explorers, accompanied by five assist ant French Canadians, set out from Mackinaw on their daring voyage of discovery. The Indians, who gathered to witness their departure, were astonished at the boldness of the undertaking, and endeavored to dissuade them from their purpose by representing the tribes on the Mississippi as exceedingly savage and cruel, and the river itself as full of all sorts of frightful monsters ready to swallow them and their canoes together. But, nothing daunted by these terrific descriptions, Marquette told them he was willing not only to encounter all the perils of the unknown region they were about to explore, but to lay down his life in a cause in which the salvation of souls was involved ; and having prayed together they separated. Coasting along the northern shore of Lake Michigan, the adventurers entered Green Bay, and passed thence up the Fox River and Lake Winnebago to a village of the Miamis and Kickapoos. Here Mar quette was delighted to find a beautiful cross planted in the middle of the town ornamented with white skins, red girdles and bows and arrows, which these good people had offered to the Great Manitou, or God, to thank him for the pity he had bestowed on them during the Winter in giving them an abundant \" chase.\" This was the farthest outpost to which Dablon and Allouez had extended their missionary labors the year previous. Here Marquette drank mineral waters and was instructed in the secret of a root which cures the bite of the venomous rattlesnake. He assembled the chiefs and old men of the village, and, pointing to Joliet, said : \" My friend is an envoy of France, to discover new coun tries, and I am an ambassador from God to enlighten them with the truths of the Gospel.\" Two Miami guides were here furnished to conduct them to the Wisconsin River, and they set out from the Indian village on the 10th of June, amidst a great crowd of natives who had assembled to witness their departure into a region where no white man had ever yet ventured. The guides, having conducted them across the portage, returned. The explorers launched their canoes upon the Wisconsin, which they descended to the Mississippi and proceeded down its unknown waters. What emotions must have swelled their breasts as they struck out into the broadening current and became conscious that they were now upon the bosom of ths Father of Waters. The mystery was about to be lifted from the long-sought river. The scenery in that locality is beautiful, and on that delightful seventeenth of June must have been clad in all its primeval loveliness as it had been adorned by the hand of"], [21, "23 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. Nature. Drifting rapidly, it is said that the bold bluffs on either hand \" reminded them of the castled shores of their own beautiful rivers of France.\" By-and-by, as they drifted along, great herds of buffalo appeared on the banks. On going to the heads of the valley they could see a country of the greatest beauty and fertility, apparently destitute of inhab itants yet presenting the appearance of extensive manors, under the fas tidious cultivation of lordly proprietors. THE WILD PEAIEIE. On June 25, they went ashore and found some fresh traces of men upon the sand, and a path which led to the prairie. The men remained in the boat, and Marquette and Joliet followed the path till they discovered a village on the banks of a river, and two other villages on a hill, within a half league of the first, inhabited by Indians. They were received most hospitably by these natives, who had never before seen a white person. After remaining a few days they re-embarked and descended the river to about latitude 33\u00b0, where they found a village of the Arkansas, and being satisfied that the river flowed into the Gulf of Mexico, turned their course"], [22, "24 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. up the river, and ascending the stream to the mouth of the Illinois, rowed up that stream to its source, and procured guides from that point to the lakes. \" Nowhere on this journey,\" says Marquette, \" did we see such grounds, meadows, woods, stags, buffaloes, deer, wildcats, bustards, swans, ducks, parroquets, and even beavers, as on the Illinois River.\" The party, without loss or injury; reached Green Bay in September, and reported their discovery\u2014 one of the most important of the age, but of which no record was preserved save Marquette's, Joliet losing his by the upsetting of his canoe on his way to Quebec. Afterward Marquette returned to the Illinois Indians by their request, and ministered to them until 1675. On the 18th of May, in that year, as he was passing the mouth of a stream \u2014 going with his boatmen up Lake Michigan \u2014 he asked to land at its mouth and celebrate Mass. Leaving his men with the canoe, he retired a short distance and began his devotions. As much time passed and he did not return, his men went in search of him, and found him upon his knees, dead. He had peacefully passed away while at prayer. He was buried at this spot. Charlevoix, who visited the place fifty years after, found the waters had retreated from the grave, leaving the beloved missionary to repose in peace. The river has since been called Marquette. While Marquette and his companions were pursuing their labors in the West, two men, differing widely from him and each other, were pre paring to follow in his footsteps and perfect the discoveries so well begun by him. These were Robert de La Salle and Louis Hennepin. After La Salle's return from the discovery of the Ohio River (see the narrative elsewhere), he established himself again among the French trading posts in Canada. Here he mused long upon the pet project of those ages \u2014 a short way to China and the East, and was busily planning an expedition up the great lakes, and so across the continent to the Pacific, when Marquette returned from the Mississippi. At once the vigorous mind of LaSalle received from his and his companions' stories the idea that by fol lowing the Great River northward, or by turning up some of the numerous western tributaries, the object could easily be gained. He applied to Frontenac, Governor General of Canada, and laid before him the plan, dim but gigantic. Frontenac entered warmly into his plans, and saw that LaSalie's idea to connect the great lakes by a chain of forts with the Gulf of Mexico would bind tne country so wonderfully together, give un measured power to France, and glory to himself, under whose adminis tration he earnestly hoped all would be realized. LaSalle now repaired to Fiance, laid his plans before the King, who warmly approved of them, and made him a Chevalier. He also received from all the noblemen the warmest wishes for his success. The Ohev"], [23, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 25 alier returned to Canada, and busily entered upon his work. He at once rebuilt Fort Frontenac and constructed the first ship to sail on these fresh-water seas. On the 7th of August, 1679, having been joined by Hennepin, he began his voyage in the Griffin up Lake Erie. He passed over this lake, through the straits beyond, up Lake St. Clair and into Huron. In this lake they encountered heavy storms. They were some time at Michillimackinac, where LaSalle founded a fort, and passed on to Green Bay, the \" Baie des Puans \" of the French, where he found a large quantity of furs collected for him. He loaded the Griffin with these, and placing her under the care of a pilot and fourteen sailors, LA SALLE LANDING ON THE SHORE OF GREEN BAY. started her on her return voyage. The vessel was never afterward heard of. He remained about these parts until early in the Winter, when, hear ing nothing from the Griffin, he collected all the men \u2014 thirty working men and three monks \u2014 and started again upon his great undertaking. By a short portage they passed to the Illinois or Kankakee, called by the Indians, \"Theakeke,\" wolf, because of the tribes of Indians called by that name, commonly known as the Mahingans, dwelling there. The French pronounced it Kiakiki, which became corrupted to Kankakee. \"Falling down the said river by easy journeys, the better to observe the country,\" about the last of December they reached a village of the Illi nois Indians, containing some five hundred cabins, but at that moment"], [24, "26 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. no inhabitants. The Seur de LaSalle being in want of some breadstuff's, took advantage of the absence of the Indians to help himself to a suffi ciency of maize, large quantities of which he found concealed in holes under the wigwams. This village was situated near the present village of Utica in LaSalle County, Illinois. The corn being securely stored, the voyagers again betook themselves to the stream, and toward evening, on the 4th day of January, 1680, they came into a lake which must have been the lake of Peoria. This was called by the Indians Pim-i-te-wi, that is, a place where there are many fat beasts. Here the natives were met with in large numbers, but they were gentle and kind, and having spent some time with them, LaSalle determined to erect another fort in that place, for he had heard rumors that some of the adjoining tribes were trying to disturb the good feeling which existed, and some of his men were disposed to complain, owing to the hardships and perils of the travel. He called this fort \" Crevec\u0153ur \" (broken-heart), a name expressive of the very natural sorrow and anxiety which the pretty certain loss of his ship, Griffin, and his consequent impoverishment, the danger of hostility on the part of the Indians, and of mutiny among his own men, might well cause him. His fears were not entirely groundless. At one time poison was placed in his food, but fortunately was discovered. While building this fort, the Winter wore away, the prairies began to look green, and LaSalle, despairing of any reinforcements, concluded to return to Canada, raise new means and new men, and embark anew in the enterprise. For this purpose he made Hennepin the leader of a party to explore the head waters of the Mississippi, and he set out on his jour ney. This journey was accomplished with the aid of a few persons, and was successfully made, though over an almost u iknown route, and in a bad season of the year. He safely reached Cana Ja, and set out again for the object of his search. Hennepin and his party left Fort Crevec\u0153ur on the last of February, 1680. When LaSalle reached this place on his return expedition, he found the fort entirely deserted, and he was obliged to return again to Canada. He embarked the third time, and succeeded. Seven days after leaving the fort, Hennepin reached the Mississippi, and paddling up the icy stream as best he could, reached no higher than the Wisconsin River by the 11th of April. Here he and his followers were taken prisoners by a band of Northern Indians, who treated them with great kindness. Hen nepin's comrades were Anthony Auguel and Michael Ako. On this voy age they found several beautiful lakes, a,nd \"saw some charming prairies.\" Their captors were the Isaute or Sauteurs, Chippewas, a tribe of the Sioux nation, who took them up the river until about the first of May, when they reached some falls, which Hennepin christened Falls of St. Anthony"], [25, "27 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. in honor of his patron saint. Here they took the land, and traveling aearly two hundred miles to the northwest, brought them to their villages. Here they were kept about three months, were treated kindly by their captors, and at the end of that time, were met by a band of Frenchmen, BUFFALO HUNT. headed by one Senr de Luth, who, in pursuit of trade and game, had pene trated thus far by the route of Lake Superior; and with these fellow countrymen Hennepin and his companions were allowed to return to the borders of civilized life in November, 1680, just after LaSalle had returned to the wilderness on his second trip. Hennepin soon after went to France, where he published an account of his adventures."], [26, "28 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. The Mississippi was first discovered by De Soto in April, 1541, in his vain endeayor to find gold and precious gems. In the following Spring, De Soto, weary with hope long deferred, and worn out with his wander ings, he fell a victim to disease, and on the 21st of May died. His followers, reduced by fatigue and disease to less than three hundred men, wandered about the country nearly a year, in the vain endeavor to rescue them selves by land, and finally constructed seven small vessels, called brigan tines, in which they embarked, and descending the river, supposing it would lead them to the sea, in July they came to the sea (Gulf of Mexico), and by September reached the Island of Cuba. They were the first to see the great outlet of the Mississippi ; but, being so weary and discouraged, made.no attempt to claim the country, and hardly had an intelligent idea of what they had passed through. To La Salle, the intrepid explorer, belongs the honor of giving the first account of the mouths of the river. His great desire was to possess this entire countr}r for his king, and in January, 1682, he and his band of explorers left the shores of Lake Michigan on their third attempt, crossed the portage, passed down the Illinois River, and on the 6th of February, reached the banks of the Mississippi. On the 13th thej^ commenced their downward course, which they pursued with but one interruption, until upon the 6th of March they dis covered the three great passages by which the river discharges its waters into the gulf. La Salle thus narrates the event : \" We landed on the bank of the most western channel, about three leagues (nine miles) from its mouth. On the seventh, M. de LaSalle went to reconnoiter the shores of the neighboring sea, and M. de Tonti meanwhile examined the great middle channel. They found the main outlets beautiful, large and deep. On the 8th we reascended the river, a little above its confluence with the sea, to find a dry place beyond the re*.5'li of inundations. The elevation of the North Pole was here about twenty-seven degrees. Here we prepared a column and a cross, and to the column were affixed the arms of France with this inscription : Louis Le Grand, Roi De France et de Navarre, regne ; Le neuvic:me Avril, i632. The whole party, under arms, chanted the Te Deum. and then, after a salute and cries of \" Vioe le Roi,\" the column was erected by M. de La Salle, who, standing near it, proclaimed in a loud voice the authority of the King of France. LaSalle returned and laid the foundations of the Mis sissippi settlements in Illinois, thence he proceeded to France, where another expedition was fitted out, of which he was commander, and in two succeeding voyages failed to find the outlet of the river by sailing along the shore of the gulf. On his third voyage he was killed, through the"], [27, "29 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. treachery of his followers, and the object of his expeditions was not accomplished until 1699, when DTberville, under the authority of the crown, discovered, on the second of March, by way of the sea, the mouth of the \" Hidden River.\" This majestic stream was called by the natives \" Malbouchia,,~ and by the Spaniards, \" la Palissade,\" from the great TRAPPING. number of trees about its mouth. After traversing the several outlets, and satisfying himself as to its certainty, he erected a fort near its western outlet, and returned to France. An avenue of trade was now opened out which was fully improved. In 1718, New Orleans was laid out and settled by some European colo nists. In 1762, the colony was made over to Spain, to be regained by France under the consulate of Napoleon. In 1803, it was purchased by"], [28, "30 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. the United States for the sum of fifteen million dollars, and the territory of Louisiana and commerce of the Mississippi River came under the charge of the United States. Although LaSalle's labors ended in defeat and death, he had not worked and suffered in vain. He had thrown open to France and the world an immense and most valuable country ; had established several ports, and laid the foundations of more than one settlement there. \" Peoria, Kaskaskia and Cahokia, are to this day monu- ments of LaSalle's labors ; for, though he had founded neither of them (unless Peoria, which was built nearly upon the site of Fort Crevec\u0153ur,) it was by those whom he led into the West that these places were peopled and civilized. He was, if not the discoverer, the first settler of the Mississippi Valley, and as such deserves to be known and honored.\" The French early improved the opening made for them. Before the year 1698, the Rev. Father Gravier began a mission among the Illinois, and founded Kaskaskia. For some time this was merely a missionary station, where none but natives resided, it being one of three such vil lages, the other two being Cahokia and Peoria. What is known of these missions is learned from a letter written by Father Gabriel Marest, dated \" Aux Cascaskias, autrement dit de lTmmaculate Conception de la Sainte Vierge, le 9 Novembre, 1712.\" Soon after the founding of Kaskaskia, the missionary, Pinet, gathered a flock at Cahokia, while Peoria arose near the ruins of Fort Crevec\u0153ur. This must have been about the year 1700. The post at Vincennes on the Oubache river, (pronounced Wa-ba, meaning summer cloud moving swiftly') was estab lished in 1702, according to the best authorities.* It is altogether prob able that on LaSalle's last trip he established the stations at Kaskaskia and Cahokia. In July, 1701, the foundations of Fort Ponchartrain were laid by De la Motte Cadillac on the Detroit River. These sta tions, with those established further north, were the earliest attempts to occupy the Northwest Territory. At the same time efforts were being made to occupy the Southwest, which finally culminated in the settle ment and founding of the City of New Orleans by a colony from England in 1718. This was mainly accomplished through the efforts of the famous Mississippi Company^, established by the notorious John Law, who so quickly arose into prominence in France, and who with his scheme so quickly and so ignominiously passed away. From the time of the founding of these stations for fifty years the French nation were engrossed with the settlement of the lower Missis sippi, and the war with the Chicasaws, who had, in revenge for repeated \u2022 There is considerable dispute about this date, some asserting it was sounded as late as 1742.

Although the company did little for Louisiana, as the entire West was then called, yet it opened the trade through the Mississippi River, and started the raising of grains indigenous to that climate. Until the year 1750, but little is known of the settlements in the Northwest, as it was not until this time that the attention of the English was called so the occupation of this portion of the New World, which they then supposed they owned. Vivier, a missionary among the Illinois, writing from \" Aux Illinois,\" six leagues from Fort Chartres, June 8, 1750, says: \"We have here whites, negroes and Indians, to say nothing of cross-breeds. There are five French villages, and three villages of the natives, within a space of twenty-one leagues situated between the Mississippi and another river called the Karkadaid (Kaskaskias). In the five French villages are, perhaps, eleven hundred whites, three hundred blacks and some sixty red slaves or savages. The three Illinois towns do not contain more than eight hundred souls all told. Most of the French till the soil; they raise wheat, cattle, pigs and horses, and live like princes. Three times as much is produced as can be consumed ; and great quantities of grain and flour are sent to New Orleans.\" This city was now the seaport town of the Northwest, and save in the extreme northern part, where only furs and copper ore were found, almost all the products of the country found their way to France by the mouth of the Father of Waters. In another letter, dated Novem ber 7, 1750, this same priest says: \"For fifteen leagues above the mouth of the Mississippi one sees no dwellings, the ground being too low to be habitable. Thence to New Orleans, the lands are only partially occupied. New Orleans contains black, white and red, not more, I think, than twelve hundred persons. To this point come all lumber, bricks, salt-beef, tallow, tar, skins and bear's grease ; and above all, pork and flour from the Illinois. These things create some commerce, as forty vessels and more have come hither this year. Above New Orleans, plantations are again met with ; the most considerable is a colony of Germans, some ten leagues up the river. At Point Coupee, thirty-five leagues above the German settlement, is a fort. Along here, within five or six leagues, are not less than sixty habitations. Fifty leagues farther up is the Natchez post, where we have a garrison, who are kept prisoners through fear of the Chickasaws. Here and at Point Coupee, they raise excellent tobacco. Another hundred leagues brings us to the Arkansas, where we have also a fort and a garrison for the benefit of the river traders. * * * From the Arkansas to the Illinois, nearly five hundred leagues, there is not a settlement. There should be, however, a fort at the Oubache (Ohio), the only path by which the English can reach the Mississippi. In the Illinois country are numberless mines, but no one to"], [30, "32 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. work them as they deserve.\" Father Marest, writing from the post at Vincennes in 1812, makes the same observation. Vivier also says : \" Some individuals dig lead near the surface and supply the Indians and Canada. Two Spaniards now here, who claim to be adepts, say that our mines are like those of Mexico, and that if we would dig deeper, we should find silver under the lead ; and at any rate the lead is excellent. There is also in this country, beyond doubt, copper ore, as from time to time large pieces are found in the streams.\". HUNTING. At the close of the year 1750, the French occupied, in addition to the lower Mississippi posts and those in Illinois, one at Du Quesne, one at the Mauinee in the country of the Miamis, and one at Sandusky in what may be' termed the Ohio Valley. In the northern part of the Northwest they had station's at St. Joseph's on the St. -Joseph's of Lake Michigan, at Fort Ponchartiain (Detroit), at Michillimackanac or Massillimacanac, Fox River of Green Bay, and at Sault Ste. Marie. The fondest dreams of LaSalle were now fully realized. The French alone were possessors of this vast realm, basing their claim on discovery and settlement. Another nation, however, was now turning its attention to this extensive country,"], [31, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 33 and hearing of its wealth, began to lay plans for occupying it and for securing the great profits arising therefrom. The French, however, had another claim to this country, namely, the DISCOVERY OF THE OHIO. This \" Beautiful\" river was discovered by Robert Cavalier de La- Salle in 1669, four years before the discovery of the Mississippi by Joliet and Marquette. While LaSalle was at his trading post on the St. Lawrence, he found leisure to study nine Indian dialects, the chief of which was the Iroquois. He not only desired to facilitate his intercourse in trade, but he longed to travel and explore the unknown regions of the West. An incident soon occurred which decided him to fit out an exploring expedition. While conversing with some Senecas, he learned of a river called the Ohio, which rose in their country and flowed to the sea, but at such a distance that it required eight months to reach its mouth. In this state ment the Mississippi and its tributaries were considered as one stream. LaSalle believing, as most of the French at that period did, that the great rivers flowing west emptied into the Sea of California, was anxious to embark in the enterprise of discovering a route across the continent to the commerce of China and Japan. He repaired at once to Quebec to obtain the approval of the Gov ernor. His eloquent appeal prevailed. The Governor and the Intendant, Talon, issued letters patent authorizing the enterprise, but made no pro vision to defray the expenses. At this juncture the seminary of St. Sul pice decided to send out missionaries in connection with the expedition, and LaSalle offering to sell his improvements at LaChine to raise money, the offer was accepted by the Superior, and two thousand eight hundred dollars were raised, with which LaSalle purchased four canoes and the necessary supplies for the outfit. On the 6th of July, 1669, the party, numbering twenty-four persons, embarked in seven canoes on the St. Lawrence; two additional canoes carried the Indian guides. In three days they were gliding over the bosom of Lake Ontario. Their guides conducted them directly to the Seneca village on the bank of the Genesee, in the vicinity of the present City of Rochester, New York. Here they expected to procure guides to conduct them to the Ohio, but in this they were disappointed. The Indians seemed unfriendly to the enterprise. LaSalle suspected that the Jesuits had prejudiced their minds against his plans. After waiting a month in the hope of gaining their object, they met an Indian"], [32, "34 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. from the Iroquois colony at the head of Lake Ontario, who assured them that they could there find guides, and offered to conduct them thence. On their way the y passed the mouth of the Niagara River, when they heard for the first time the distant thunder of the cataract. Arriving lltOyllOlS CHIEF. among the Iroquois, they met with a friendly reception, and learned from a Shawanee prisoner that they could reach the Ohio in six weeks. Delighted with the unexpected good fortune, they made ready to resume their journey ; but just as they were about to start they heard of the arrival of two Frenchmen in a neighboring village. One of them proved to be Louis Joliet, afterwards famous as an explorer in the West. He"], [33, "35 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. had been sent by the Canadian Government to explore the copper mines on Lake Superior, but had failed, and was on his way back to Quebec. He gave the missionaries a map of the country he had explored in the lake region, together with an account of the condition of the Indians in that quarter. This induced the priests to determine on leaving the expedition and going to Lake Superior. LaSalle warned them that the Jesuits were probably occupying that field, and that they would meet with a cold reception. Nevertheless they persisted in their purpose, and after worship on the lake shore, parted from LaSalle. On arriving at Lake Superior, they found, as LaSalle had predicted, the Jesuit Fathers, Marquette and Dablon, occupying the field. These zealous disciples of Loyola informed them that they wanted no assistance from St. Sulpice, nor from those who made him their patron saint ; and thus repulsed, they returned to Montreal the following June without having made a single discovery or converted a single Indian. After parting with the priests, LaSalle went to the chief Iroquois village at Onondaga, where he obtained guides, and passing thence to a tributary of the Ohio south of Lake Erie, he descended the latter as far as the falls at Louisville. Thus was the Ohio discovered by LaSalle, the persevering and successful French explorer of the West, in 1669. The account of the latter part of his journey is found in an anony mous paper, which purports to have been taken from the lips of LaSalle himself during a subsequent visit to Paris. In a letter written to Count Frontenac in 1667, shortly after the discovery, he himself says that he discovered the Ohio and descended it to the falls. This was regarded as an indisputable fact by the French authorities, who claimed the Ohio Valley upon another ground. When Washington was sent by the colony of Virginia in 1753, to demand of Gordeur de St. Pierre why the French had built a fort on the Monongahela, the haughty commandant at Quebec replied : \" We claim the country on the Ohio by virtue of the discoveries of LaSalle, and will not give it up to the English. Our orders are to make prisoners of every Englishman found trading in the Ohio Valley.\" ENGLISH EXPLORATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS. When the new year of 1750 broke in upon the Father of Waters and the Great Northwest, all was still wild save at the French posts already described. In 1749, when the English first began to think seri ously about sending men into the West, the greater portion of the States of Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota were yet under the dominion of the red men. The English knew, however, pretty"], [34, "36 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. conclusively of the nature of the wealth of these wilds. As early as 1710, Governor Spotswood, of Virginia, had commenced movements to secure the country west of the Alleghenies to the English crown. In Pennsylvania, Governor Keith and James Logan, secretary of the prov ince, from 1719 to 1731, represented to the powers of England the neces sity of securing the Western lands. Nothing was done, however, by that power save to take some diplomatic steps to secure the claims of Britain to this unexplored wilderness. England had from the outset claimed from the Atlantic to the Pacific, on the ground that the discovery of the seacoast and its possession was a discovery and possession of the country, and, as is well known, her grants to the colonies extended \" from sea to sea.\" This was not all her claim. She had purchased from the Indian tribes large tracts of land. This lat ter was also a strong argument. As early as 1684, Lord Howard, Gov ernor of Virginia, held a treaty with the six nations. These were the great Northern Confederacy, and comprised at first the Mohawks, Onei das, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas. Afterward the Tuscaroras were taken into the confederacy, and it became known as the Six Nations. They came under the protection of the mother country, and again in 1701, they repeated the agreement, and in September, 1726, a formal deed was drawn up and signed by the chiefs. The validity of this claim has often been disputed, but never successfully. In 1744, a purchase was made at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, of certain lands within the \" Colony of Virginia,\" for which the Indians received ,\u00a3200 in gold and a like sum in goods, with a promise that, as settlements increased, more should be paid. The Commissioners from Virginia were Colonel Thomas Lee and Colonel William Beverly. As settlements extended, the promise of more pay was called to mind, and Mr. Conrad Weiser was sent across the mountains with presents to appease the savages. Col. Lee, and some Virginians accompa nied him with the intention of sounding the Indians upon their feelings regarding the English. They were not satisfied with their treatment, and plainly told the Commissioners why. The English did not desire the cultivation of the country, but the monopoly of the Indian trade. In 1748, the Ohio Company was formed, and petitioned the king for a grant of land beyond the Alleghenies. This was granted, and the government of Virginia was ordered to grant to them a half million acres, two hun dred thousand of which were to be located at once. Upon the 12th of June, 1749, 800,000 acres from the line of Canada north and west was made to the Loyal Company, and on the 29th of October, 1751, 100,000 acres were given to the Greenbriar Company. All this time the French were not idle. They saw that, should the British gain a foothold in the West, especially upon the Ohio, they might not only prevent the French"], [35, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 37 settling upon it, but in time would come to the lower posts and so gain possession of the whole country. Upon the 10th of May, 1774, Vaud reuil, Governor of Canada and the French possessions, well knowing the consequences that must arise from allowing the English to build trading posts in the Northwest, seized some of their frontier posts, and to further secure the claim of the French to the West, he, in 1749, sent Louis Cel eron with a party of soldiers to plant along the Ohio River, in the mounds and at the mouths of its principal tributaries, plates of lead, on which were inscribed the claims of France. These were heard of in 1752, and within the memory of residents now living along the \" Oyo,\" as the beautiful river was called by the French. One of these plates was found with the inscription partly defaced. It bears date August 16, 1749, and a copy of the inscription with particular account of the discovery of the plate, was sent by DeWitt Clinton to the American Antiquarian Society, among whose journals it may now be found.* These measures did not, however, deter the English from going on with their explorations, and though neither party resorted to arms, yet the conflict was gathering, and it was only a question of time when the storm would burst upon the frontier settlements. In 1750, Christopher Gist was sent by the Ohio- Company to examine its lands. He went to a village of the Twigtwees, on the Miami, about one hundred and fifty miles above its mouth. He afterward spoke of it as very populous. From there he went down the Ohio River nearly to the falls at the present City of Louisville, and in November he commenced a survey of the Company's lands. Dur ing the Winter, General Andrew Lewis performed a similar work for the Greenbriar Company. Meanwhile the French were busy in preparing their forts for defense, and in opening roads, and also sent a small party of soldiers to keep the Ohio clear. This party, having heard of the Eng lish post on the Miami River, early in 1652, assisted by the Ottawas and Chippewas, attacked it, and, after a severe battle, in which fourteen of the natives were killed and others wounded, captured the garrison. (They were probably garrisoned in a block house). The traders were carried away to Canada, and one account says several were burned. This fort or post was called by the English Pickawillany. A memorial of the king's ministers refers to it as \" Pickawillanes, in the center of the terri tory between the Ohio and the Wabash. The name is probably some variation of Pickaway or Picqua in 1773, written by Rev. David Jones Pickaweke.\" * The following is a translation of the inscription on the plate: \"In the year 1749. reign of Louis XV,, King of France, we, Celeron, commandant of a detachment by Monsieur the Marquis of Gallisoniere, com mander-in-chief of New France, to establish tranquility in certain Indian villages of these cantons, have buried this plate at the confluence of the Toradakoin, this twenty-ninth of July, near the river Ohio, otherwise Beautiful River, as a monument of renewal of possession which we have taken of the said river, and all its tributaries; inasmuch as the preceding Kings of France have enjoyed it, and maintained it by their arms ana treaties; especially by those of Ryswick, Utrecht, and Aix La Chapelle.\""], [36, "38 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. This was the first blood shed between the French and English, and occurred near the present City of Piqua, Ohio, or at least at a point about forty-seven miles north of Dayton. Each nation became now more inter ested in the progress of events in the Northwest. The English deter mined to purchase from the Indians a title to the lands they wished to occupy, and Messrs. Fry (afterward Commander-in-chief over Washing ton at the commencement of the French War of 1775-1763), Lomax and Patton were sent in the Spring of 1752 to hold a conference with the natives at Logstown to learn what they objected to in the treaty of Lan caster already noticed, and to settle all difficulties. On the 9th of June, these Commissioners met the red men at Logstown, a little village on the north bank of the Ohio, about seventeen miles below the site of Pitts burgh. Here had been a trading point for many years, but it was aban doned by the Indians in 1750. At first the Indians declined to recognize the treaty of Lancaster, but, the Commissioners taking aside Montour, the interpreter, who was a son of the famous Catharine Montour, and a chief among the six nations, induced him to use his influence in their favor. This he did, and upon the 13th of June they all united in signing a deed, confirming the Lancaster treaty in its full extent, consenting to a settlement of the southeast of the Ohio, and guaranteeing that it should not be disturbed by them. These were the means used to obtain the first treaty with the Indians in the Ohio Valley. Meanwhile the powers beyond the sea were trying to out-man\u0153uvre each other, and were professing to be at peace. The English generally outwitted the Indians, and failed in many instances to fulfill their con tracts. They thereby gained the ill-will of the red men, and further increased the feeling by failing to provide them with arms and ammuni tion. Said an old chief, at Easton, in 1758: \" The Indians on the Ohio left you because of your own fault. When we heard the French were coming, we asked you for help and arms, but we did not get them. The French came, they treated us kindly, and gained our affections. The Governor of Virginia settled on our lands for his own benefit, and, when we wanted help, forsook us.\" At the beginning of 1653, the English thought they had secured by title the lands in the West, but the French had quietly gathered cannon and military stores to be in readiness for the expected blow. The Eng lish made other attempts to ratify these existing treaties, but not until the Summer could the Indians be gathered together to discuss the plans of the French. They had sent messages to the French, warning them away ; but they replied that they intended to complete the chain of forts already begun, and would not abandon the field. Soon after this, no satisfaction being obtained from the Ohio regard-"], [37, "39 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. ing the positions and purposes of the French, Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia determined to send to them another messenger and learn from them, if possible, their intentions. For this purpose he selected a young man, a surveyor, who, at the early age of nineteen, had received the rank of major, and who was thoroughly posted regarding frontier life. This personage was no other than the illustrious George Washington, who then held considerable interest in Western lands. He was at this time just twenty-two years of age. Taking Gist as his guide, the two, accompanied by four servitors, set out on their perilous march. They left Will's Creek on the 10th of November, 1753, and on the 22d reached the Monon gahela, about ten miles above the fork. From there they went to Logstown, where Washington had a long conference with the chiefs of the Six Nations. From them he learned the condition of the French, and also heard of their determination not to come down the river till the fol lowing Spring. The Indians were non-committal, as they were afraid to turn either way, and, as far as they could, desired to remain neutral. Washington, finding nothing could be done with them, went on to Venango, an old Indian town at the mouth of French Creek. Here the French had a fort, called Fort Machault. Through the rum and flattery of the French, he nearly lost all his Indian followers. Finding nothing of importance here, he pursued his way amid great privations, and on the 11th of December reached the fort at the head of French Creek. Here he delivered Governor Dinwiddie's letter, received his answer, took his observations, and on the 16th set out upon his return journey with no one but Gist, his guide, and a few Indians who still remained true to him, notwithstanding the endeavors of the French to retain them. Their homeward journey was one of great peril and suffering from the cold, yet they reached home in safety on the 6th of January, 1754. From the letter of St. Pierre, commander of the French fort, sent by Washington to Governor Dinwiddie, it was learned that the French would not give up without a struggle. Active preparations were at once made in all the English colonies for the coming conflict, while the French finished the fort at Venango and strengthened their lines of fortifications, and gathered their forces to be in readiness. The Old Dominion was all alive. Virginia was the center of great activities ; volunteers were called for, and from all the neighboring colonies men rallied to the conflict, and everywhere along the Potomac men were enlisting under the Governor's proclamation \u2014 which promised two hundred thousand acres on the Ohio. Along this river they were gathering as far as Will's Creek, and far beyond this point, whither Trent had come for assistance for his little band of forty-one men, who were"], [38, "40 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. working away in hunger and want, to fortify that point at the fork of the Ohio, to which both parties were looking with deep interest. \" The first birds of Spring filled the air with their song ; the swift river rolled by the Allegheny hillsides, swollen by the melting snows of Spring and the April showers. The leaves were appearing ; a few Indian scouts were seen, but no enemy seemed near at hand ; and all was so quiet, that Frazier, an old Indian scout and trader, who had been left by Trent in command, ventured to his home at the mouth of Turtle Creek, ten miles up the Monongahela. But, though all was so quiet in that wilder ness, keen eyes had seen the low intrenchment rising at the fork, and swift feet had borne the news of it up the river ; and upon the morning of the 17th of April, Ensign Ward, who then had charge of it, saw upon the Allegheny a sight that made his heart sink \u2014 sixty batteaux and three hundred canoes filled with men, and laden deep with cannon and stores. * * * That evening he supped with his captor, Contrec\u0153ur, and the next day he was bowed off by the Frenchman, and with his men and tools, marched up the Monongahela.\" The French and Indian war had begun. The treaty of Aix la Chapelle, in 1748, had left the boundaries between the French and English possessions unsettled, and the events already narrated show the French were determined to hold the country watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries ; while the English laid claims to the country by virtue of the discoveries of the Cabots, and claimed all the country from New foundland to Florida, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The first decisive blow had now been struck, and the first attempt of the English, through the Ohio Company, to occupy these lands, had resulted disastrously to them. The French and Indians immediately completed the fortifications begun at the Fork, which they had so easily captured, and when completed gave to the fort the name of DuQuesne. Washing ton was at Will's Creek when the news of the capture of the fort arrived. He at once departed to recapture it. On his way he entrenched him self at a place called the \" Meadows,\" where he erected a fort called by him Fort Necessity. From there he surprised and captured a force of French and Indians marching against him, but was soon after attacked in his fort by a much superior force, and was obliged to yield on the morning of July 4th. He was allowed to return to Virginia. The English Government immediately planned four campaigns ; one against Fort DuQuesne ; one against Nova Scotia ; one against Fort Niagara, and one against Crown Point. These occurred during 1755-6, and were not successful in driving the French from 'their possessions. The expedition against Fort DuQuesne was led by the famous General Braddock, who, refusing to listen to the advice of Washington and those"], [39, "41 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. acquainted with Indian warfare, suffered such an inglorious defeat. This occurred on the morning of July 9th, and is generally known as the battle of Monongahela, or \" Braddock's Defeat.\" The war continued with various vicissitudes through the years 1756-7 ; when, at the commence ment of 1758, in accordance with the plans of William Pitt, then Secre tary of State, afterwards Lord Chatham, active preparations were made to carry on the war. Three expeditions were planned for this year : one, under General Amherst, against Louisburg ; another, under Abercrombie, against Fort Ticonderoga ; and a third, under General Forbes, against Fort DuQuesne. On the 26th of July, Louisburg surrendered after a desperate resistance of more than forty days, and the eastern part of the Canadian possessions fell into the hands of the British. Abercrombie captured Fort Frontenac, and when the expedition against Fort DuQuesne, of which Washington had the active command, arrived there, it was found in flames and deserted. The English at once took possession, rebuilt the fort, and in honor of their illustrious statesman, changed the name to Fort Pitt. The great object of the campaign of 1759, was the reduction of Canada. General Wolfe was to lay siege to Quebec ; Amherst was to reduce Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and General Prideaux was to capture Niagara. This latter place was taken in July, but the gallant Prideaux lost his life in the attempt. Amherst captured Ticonderoga and Crown Point without a blow ; and Wolfe, after making the memor able ascent to the Plains of Abraham, on September 13th, defeated Montcalm, and on the 18th, the city capitulated. In this engagement Montcolm and Wolfe both lost their lives. De Levi, Montcalm's successor, marched to Sillery, three miles above the city, with the purpose of defeating the English, and there, on the 28th of the following April, was fought one of the bloodiest battles of the French and Indian War. It resulted in the defeat of the French, and the fall of the City of Montreal. The Governor signed a capitulation by which the whole of Canada was surrendered to the English. This practically concluded the war, but it was not until 1763 that the treaties of peace between France and England were signed. This was done on the 10th of February of that year, and under its provisions all the country east of the Mississippi and north of the Iberville River, in Louisiana, were ceded to England. At the same time Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain. On the 13th of September, 1760, Major Robert Rogers was sent from Montreal to take charge of Detroit, the only remaining French post in the territory. He arrived there on the 19th of November, and sum moned the place to surrender. At first the commander of the post, Beletre: refused, but on the 29th, hearing of the continued defeat of the"], [40, "42 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. French arms, surrendered. Rogers remained there until December 23d under the personal protection of the celebrated chief, Pontiac, to whom, no doubt, he owed his safety. Pontiac had come here to inquire the purposes of the English in taking possession of the country. He was assured that they came simply to trade with the natives, and did not desire their country. This answer conciliated the savages, and did much to insure the safety of Rogers and his party during their stay, and while on their journey home. Rogers set out for Fort Pitt on December 23, and was just one month on the way. His route was from Detroit to Maumee, thence across the present State of Ohio directly to the fort. This was the com mon trail of the Indians in their journeys from Sandusky to the fork of the Ohio. It went from Fort Sandusky, where Sandusky City now is, crossed the Huron river, then called Bald Eagle Creek, to \" Mohickon John's Town\" on Mohickon Creek, the northern branch of White Woman's River, and thence crossed to Beaver's Town, a Delaware town on what is now Sandy Creek. At Beaver's Town were probably one hundred and fifty warriors, and not less than three thousand acres of cleared land. From there the track went up Sandy Creek to and across Big Beaver, and up the Ohio to Logstown, thence on to the fork. The Northwest Territory was now entirely under the English rule. New settlements began to be rapidly made, and the promise of a large trade was speedily manifested. Had the British carried out their promises with the natives none of those savage butcheries would have been perpe trated, and the country would have been spared their recital. The renowned chief, Pontiac, was one of the leading spirits in these atrocities. We will now pause in our narrative, and notice the leading events in his life. The earliest authentic information regarding this noted Indian chief is learned from an account of an Indian trader named Alexander Henry, who, in the Spring of 1761, penetrated his domains as far as Missillimacnac. Pontiac was then a great friend of the French, but a bitter foe of the English, whom he considered as encroaching on his hunting grounds. Henry was obliged to disguise himself as a Canadian to insure safety, but was discovered by Pontiac, who bitterly reproached him and the English for their attempted subjugation of the West. He declared that no treaty had been made with them; no presents sent them, and that he would resent any possession of the West by that nation. He was at the time about fifty years of age, tall and dignified, and was civil and military ruler of the Ottawas, Ojibwas and Pottawatamies. The Indians, from Lake Michigan to the borders of North Carolina, were united in this feeling, and at the time of the treaty of Paris, ratified February 10, 1763, a general conspiracy was formed to fall suddenly"], [41, "43 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. PONTIAC, THE OTTAWA CHIEFTAIN."], [42, "44 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. upon the frontier British posts, and with one blow strike every man dead. Pontiac was the marked leader in all this, and was the commander of the Chippewas, Ottawas, Wyandots, Miamis, Shawanese, Delawares and Mingoes, who had, for the time, laid aside their local quarrels to unite in this enterprise. The blow came, as near as can now be ascertained, on May 7, 176^. Nine British posts fell, and the Indians drank, \" scooped up in the hollow of joined hands,\" the blood of many a Briton. Pontiac's immediate field of action was the garrison at Detroit. Here, however, the plans were frustrated by an ludian woman disclosing the plot the evening previous to his arrival. Everything was carried out, however, according to Pontiac's plans until the moment of action, when Major Gladwyn, the commander of the post, stepping to one of the Indian chiefs, suddenly drew aside his blanket and disclosed the concealed musket. Pontiac, though a brave man, turned pale and trembled. He saw his plan was known, and that the garrison were prepared. He endeavored to exculpate himself from any such intentions ; but the guilt was evident, and he and his followers were dismissed with a severe reprimand, and warned never to again enter the walls of the post. Pontiac at once laid siege to the fort, and until the treaty of peace between the British and the Western Indians, concluded in August, 1764, continued to harass and besiege the fortress. He organized a regular commissariat department, issued bills of credit written out on bark, which, to his credit, it may be stated, were punctually redeemed. At the conclusion of the treaty, in which it seems he took no part, he went further south, living many years among the Illinois. He had given up all hope of saving his country and race. After a time he endeavored to unite the Illinois tribe and those about St. Louis in a war with the whites. His efforts were fruitless, and only ended in a quarrel between himself and some Kaskaskia Indians, one of whom soon afterwards killed him. His death was, however, avenged by the northern Indians, who nearly exterminated the Illinois in the wars which followed. Had it not been for the treachery of a few of his followers, his plan for the extermination of the whites, a masterly one, would undoubtedly have been carried out. It was in the Spring of the year following Rogers' visit that Alex ander Henry went to Missillimacnac, and everywhere found the strongest feelings against the English, who had not carried out their promises, and were doing nothing to conciliate the natives. Here he met the chief, Pontiac, who, after conveying to him in a speech the idea that their French father would awake soon and utterly destroy his enemies, said : \" Englishman, although you have conquered the French, you have not"], [43, "45 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. yet conquered us ! We are not your slaves! These lakes, these woods, these mountains, were left us by our ancestors. They are our inheritance, and we will part with them to none. Your nation supposes that we, like the white people, can not live without bread and pork and beef. But you ought to know that He, the Great Spirit and Master of Life, has provided food for us upon these broad lakes and in these mountains.\" He then spoke of the fact that no treaty had been made with them, no presents sent them, and that he and his people were yet for war. Such were the feelings of the Northwestern Indians immediately after the English took possession of their country. These feelings were no doubt encouraged by the Canadians and French, who hoped that yet the French arms might prevail. The treaty of Paris, however, gave to the English the right to this vast domain, and active preparations were going on to occupy it and enjoy its trade and emoluments. In 1762, France, by a secret treaty, ceded Louisiana to Spain, to pre vent it falling into the hands of the English, who were becoming masters of the entire West. The next year the treaty of Paris, signed at Fon tainbleau, gave to the English the domain of the country in question. Twenty years after, by the treaty of peace between the United States and England, that part of Canada lying south and west of the Great Lakes, comprehending a large territory which is the subject of these sketches, was acknowledged to be a portion of the United States ; and twenty years still later, in 1803, Louisiana was ceded by Spain back to France, and by France sold to the United States. In the half century, from the building of the Fort of Crevec\u0153ur by LaSalle, in 1680, up to the erection of Fort Chartres, many French set tlements had been made in that quarter. These have already been noticed, being those at St. Vincent (Vincennes), Kohokia or Cahokia, Kaskaskia and Prairie du Rocher, on the American Bottom, a large tract of rich alluvial soil in Illinois, on the Mississippi, opposite the site of St. Louis. By the treaty of Paris, the regions east of the Mississippi, including all these and other towns of the Northwest, were given over to England; but they do not appear to have btsn taken possession of until 1765, when Captain Stirling, in the name of the Majesty of England, established him self at Fort Chartres bearing with him the proclamation of General Gage, dated December 30, 1764, which promised religious freedom to all Cath olics who worshiped here, and a right to leave the country with their effects if they wished, or to remain with the privileges of Englishmen. It was shortly after the occupancy of the West by the British that the war with Pontiac opened. It is alreadyr noticed in the sketch of that chieftain- By it many a Briton lost his life, and many a frontier settle-"], [44, "46 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. ment in its infancy ceased to exist. This was not ended until the year 1764, when, failing to capture Detroit, Niagara and Fort Pitt, his confed eracy became disheartened, and, receiving no aid from the French, Pon tiac abandoned the enterprise and departed to the Illinois, among whom lie afterward lost his life. As soon as these difficulties were definitely settled, settlers began rapidly to survey the country and prepare for occupation. During the year 1770, a number of persons from Virginia and other British provinces explored and marked out nearly all the valuable lands on the Mononga hela and along the banks of the Ohio as far as the Little Kanawha. This was followed by another exploring expedition, in which George Washing ton was a party. The latter, accompanied by Dr. Craik, Capt. Crawford and others, on the 20th of October, 1770, descended the Ohio from Pitts burgh to the mouth of the Kanawha ; ascended that stream about fourteen miles, marked out several large tracts of land, shot several buffalo, which were then abundant in the Ohio Valley, and returned to the fort. Pittsburgh was at this time a trading post, about which was clus tered a village of some twenty houses, inhabited by Indian traders. This same year, Capt. Pittman visited Kaskaskia and its neighboring villages. He found there about sixty-five resident families, and at Cahokia only forty-five dwellings. At Fort Chartres was another small settlement, and at Detroit the garrison were quite prosperous and strong. For a year or two settlers continued to locate near some of these posts, generally Fort Pitt or Detroit, owing to the fears of the Indians, who still main tained some feelings of hatred to the English. The trade from the posts was quite good, and from those in Illinois large quantities of pork and flour found their way to the New Orleans market. At this time the policy of the British Government was strongly opposed to the extension of the colonies west. In 1763, the King of England forbade, by royal proclamation, his colonial subjects from making a settlement beyond the sources of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean. At the instance of the Board of Trade, measures were taken to prevent the settlement without the limits prescribed, and to retain the commerce within easy reach of Great Britain. The commander-in-chief of the king's forces wrote in 1769 : \" In the course of a few years necessity will compel the colonists, should they extend their settlements west, to provide manufactures of some kind for themselves, and when all connection upheld by commerce with the mother country ceases, an independency in their government will soon follow.\" In accordance with this policy, Gov. Gage issued a proclamation in 1772, commanding the inhabitants of Vincennes to abandon their sett lements and join some of the Eastern English colonies. To this they"], [45, "47 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. strenuously objected, giving good reasons therefor, and were allowed to remain. The strong opposition to this policy of Great Britain led to its change, and to such a course as to gain the attachment of the French population. In December, 1773, influential citizens of Quebec petitioned the king for an extension of the boundary lines of that province, which was granted, and Parliament passed an act on June 2, 1774, extend ing the boundary so as to include the territory lying within the present States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. In consequence of the liberal policy pursued by the British Govern ment toward the French settlers in the West, they were disposed to favor that nation in the war which soon followed with the colonies ; but the early alliance between France and America soon brought them to the side of the war for independence. In 1774, Gov. Dunmore, of Virginia, began to encourage emigration to the Western lands. He appointed magistrates at Fort Pitt under the pretense that the fort was under the government of that commonwealth. One of these justices, John Connelly, who possessed a tract of land in the Ohio Valley, gathered a force of men and garrisoned the fort, calling it Fort Dunmore. This and other parties were formed to select sites for settlements, and often came in conflict with the Indians, who yet claimed portions of the valley, and several battles followed. These ended in the famous battle of Kanawha in July, where the Indians were defeated and driven across the Ohio. During the years 1775 and 1776, by the operations of land companies and the perseverance of individuals, several settlements were firmly estab lished between the Alleghanies and the Ohio River, and western land speculators were busy in Illinois and on the Wabash. At a council held in Kaskaskia on July 5, 1773, an association of English traders, calling themselves the \" Illinois Land Company,\" obtained from ten chiefs of the Kaskaskia, Cahokia and Peoria tribes two large tracts of land lying on the east side of the Mississippi River south of the Illinois. In 1775, a mer chant from the Illinois Country, named Viviat, came to Post Vincennes as the agent of the association called the \" Wabash Land Company.\" On the 8th of October he obtained from eleven Piankeshaw chiefs, a deed for 37,497,600 acres of land. This deed was signed by the grantors, attested by a number of the inhabitants of Vincennes, and afterward recorded in the office of a notary public at Kaskaskia. This and other land com panies had extensive schemes for the colonization of the West ; but all were frustrated by the breaking out of the Revolution. On the 20th of April, 1780, the two companies named consolidated under the name of the \" United Illinois and Wabash Land Company.\" They afterward made"], [46, "48 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. strenuous efforts to have these grants sanctioned by Congress, but all signally failed. When the War of the Revolution commenced, Kentucky was an unor ganized country, though there were several settlements within her borders. In Hutchins' Topography of Virginia, it is stated that at that time \" Kaskaskia contained 80 houses, and nearly 1,000 white and black in habitants \u2014 the whites being a little the more numerous. Cahokia con tains 50 houses and 300 white inhabitants, and 80 negroes. There were east of the Mississippi River, about the year 1771 \" \u2014 when these observa tions were made \u2014 \" 300 white men capable of bearing arms, and 230 negroes.\" From 1775 until the expedition of Clark, nothing is recorded and nothing known of these settlements, save what is contained in a report made by a committee to Congress in June, 1778. From it the following extract is made : \"Near the mouth of the River Kaskaskia, there is a village which appears to have contained nearly eighty families from the beginning of the late revolution. There are twelve families in a small A'illage at la Prairie du Rochers, and near fifty families at the Kahokia Village. There are also four or five families at Fort Chartres and St. Philips, which is five miles further up the river.\" St. Louis had been settled in February, 1764, and at this time con tained, including its neighboring towns, over six hundred whites and one hundred and fifty negroes. It must be remembered that all the country west of the Mississippi was now under French rule, and remained so until ceded again to Spain, its original owner, who afterwards sold it and the country including New Orleans to the United States. At Detroit there were, according to Capt. Carver, who was in the Northwest from 1766 to 1768, more than one hundred houses, and the river was settled for more than twenty miles, although poorly cultivated \u2014 the people being engaged in the Indian trade. This old town has a history, which we will here relate. It is the oldest town in the Northwest, having been founded by Antoine de Lamotte Cadillac, in 1701. It was laid out in the form of an oblong square, of two acres in length, and an acre and a half in width. As described by A. D. Frazer, who first visited it and became a permanent resident of the place, in 1778, it comprised within its limits that space between Mr. Palmer's store (Conant Block) and Capt. Perkins' house (near the Arsenal building), and extended back as far as the public barn, and was bordered in front by the Detroit River. It was surrounded by oak and cedar pickets, about fifteen feet long, set in the ground, and had four gates \u2014 east, west, north and south. Over the first three of these"], [47, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 49 gates were- block houses provided with four guns apiece, each a six pounder. Two six-gun batteries were planted fronting the river and in a parallel direction with the block houses. There were four streets running east and west, the main street being twenty feet wide and the rest fifteen feet, while the four streets crossing these at right angles were from ten to fifteen feet in width. At the date spoken of by Mr. Frazer, there was no fort within the enclosure, but a citadel on the ground corresponding to the present northwest corner of Jefferson Avenue and Wayne Street. The citadel was inclosed by pickets, and within it were erected barracks of wood, two stories high, sufficient to contain ten officers, and also barracks sufficient to contain four hundred men, and a provision store built of brick. The citadel also contained a hospital and guard-house. The old town of Detroit, in 1778, contained about sixty houses, most of them one story, with a few a story and a half in height. They were all of logs, some hewn and some round. There was one building of splendid appearance, called the \" King's Palace,\" two stories high, which stood near the east gate. It was built for Governor Hamilton, the first governor commissioned by the British. There were two guard-houses, one near the west gate and the other near the Government House. Each of the guards consisted of twenty-four men and a subaltern, who mounted regularly every morning between nine and ten o'clock, Each furnished four sentinels, who were relieved every two hours. There was also an officer of the day, who pjr formed strict duty. Each of the gates was shut regularly at sunset ; even wicket gates were shut at nine o'clock, and all the keys were delivered into the hands of the commanding officer. They were opened in the morning at sunrise. No Indian or squaw was permitted to enter town with any weapon, such as a tomahawk or a knife. It was a stand ing order that the Indians should deliver their arms and instruments of every kind before they were permitted to pass the sentinel, and they were restored to them on their return. No more than twenty-five Indians were allowed to enter the town at any one time, and they were admitted only at the east and west gates. At sundown the drums beat, and all the Indians were required to leave town instantly. There was a council house near the water side for the purpose of holding council with the Indians. The population of the town was about sixty families, in all about two hundred males and one hundred females. This town was destroyed by fire, all except one dwelling, in 1805. After which the present \" new \" town was laid out. On the breaking out of the Revolution, the British held every post of importance in the West. Kentucky was formed as a component part of Virginia, and the sturdy pioneers of the West, alive to their interests,"], [48, "50 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. and recognizing the great benefits of obtaining the control of the trade in this part of the New World, held steadily to their purposes, and those within the commonwealth of Kentucky proceeded to exercise their civil privileges, by electing John Todd and Richard Gallaway, burgesses to represent them in the Assembly of the parent state. Early in September of that year (1777) the first court was held in Harrodsburg, and Col. Bowman, afterwards major, who had arrived in August, was made the commander of a militia organization which had been commenced the March previous. Thus the tree of loyalty was growing. The chief spirit in this far-out colony, who had represented her the year previous east of the mountains, was now meditating a move unequaled in its boldness. He had been watching the movements of the British throughout the Northwest, and understood their whole plan. He saw it was through their possession of the posts at Detroit, Vincennes, Kaskaskia, and other places, which would give them constant and easy access to the various Indian tribes in the Northwest, that the British intended to penetrate the country from the north and soutn, ana annihi late the frontier fortresses. This moving, energetic man was Colonel, afterwards General, George Rogers Clark. He knew the Indians were not unanimously in accord with the English, and he was convinced that, could the British be defeated and expelled from the Northwest, the natives might be easily awed into neutrality ; and by spies sent for the purpose, he satisfied himself that the enterprise against the Illinois settlements might easily succeed. Having convinced himself of the certainty of the project, he repaired to the Capital of Virginia, which place he reached on November 5th. While he was on his way, fortunately, on October 17th. Burgoyne had been defeated, and the spirits of the colonists greatly encouraged thereby. Patrick Henry was Governor of Virginia, and at once entered heartily into Clark's plans. The same plan had before been agitated in the Colonial Assemblies, but there was no one until Clark came who was sufficiently acquainted with the condition of affairs at the scene of action to be able to guide them. Clark, having satisfied the Virginia leaders of the feasibility of his plan, received, on the 2d of January, two sets of instructions \u2014 one secret, the other open \u2014 the latter authorized him to proceed to enlist seven companies to go to Kentucky, subject to his orders, and to serve three months from their arrival in the West. The secret order authorized him to arm these troops, to procure his powder and lead of General Hand at Pittsburgh, and to proceed at once to subjugate the country. With these instructions Clark repaired to Pittsburgh, choosing rather to raise his men west of the mountains, as he well knew all were needed in the colonies in the conflict there. He sent Col. W. B. Smith to Hoi-"], [49, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 51 ston for the same purpose, but neither succeeded in raising the required number of men. The settlers in these parts were afraid to leave their own firesides exposed to a vigilant foe, and but few could be induced to join the proposed expedition. With three companies and several private volunteers, Clark at length commenced his descent of the Ohio, which he navigated as far as the Falls, where he took possession of and fortified Corn Island, a small island between the present Cities of Louisville, Kentucky, and New Albany, Indiana. Remains of this fortification may yet be found. At this place he appointed Col. Bowman to meet him with such recruits as had reached Kentucky by the southern route, and as many as could be spared from the station. Here he announced to the men their real destination. Having completed his arrangements, and chosen his party, he left a small garrison upon the island, and on the 24th of June, during a total eclipse of the sun, which to them augured no good, and which fixes beyond dispute the date of starting, he with his chosen band, fell down the river. His plan was to go by water as far as Fort Massac or Massacre, and thence march direct to Kaskaskia. Here he intended to surprise the garrison, and after its capture go 'to Cahokia, then to Vincennes, and lastly to Detroit. Should he fail, he intended to march directly to the Mississippi River and cross it into the Spanish country. Before his start he received two good items of infor mation : one that the alliance had been formed between France and the United States ; and the other that the Indians throughout the Illinois country and the inhabitants, at the various frontier posts, had been led to believe by the British that the \" Long Knives\" or Virginians, were the most fierce, bloodthirsty and cruel savages that ever scalped a foe. With this impression on their minds, Clark saw that proper management would cause them to submit at once from fear, if surprised, and then from grati tude would become friendly if treated with unexpected leniency. The march to Kaskaskia was accomplished through a hot July sun, and the town reached on the evening of July 4. He captured the fort near the village, and soon after the village itself by surprise, and without the loss of a single man or by killing any of the enemy. After sufficiently working upon the fears of the natives, Clark told them they were at per fect liberty to worship as they pleased, and to take whichever side of the great conflict they would, also he would protect them from any barbarity from British or Indian foe. This had the desired effect, and the inhab itants, so unexpectedly and so gratefully surprised by the unlooked for turn of affairs, at once swore allegiance to the American arms, and when Clark desired to go to Cahokia on the 6th of July, they accom panied him, and through their influence the inhabitants of the place surrendered, and gladly placed themselves under his protection. Thus"], [50, "52 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. the two important posts in Illinois passed from the hands of the English into the possession of Virginia. In the person of the priest at Kaskaskia, M. Gibault, Clark found a powerful ally and generous friend. Clark saw that, to retain possession of the Northwest and treat successfully with the Indians within its boun daries, he must establish a government for the colonies he had taken. St. Vincent, the next important post to Detroit, remained yet to be taken before the Mississippi Valley was conquered. M. Gibault told him that he would alone, by persuasion, lead Vincennes to throw off its connection with England. Clark gladly accepted his offer, and on the 14th of July, in company with a fellow-townsman, M. Gibault started on his mission of peace, and on the 1st of August returned with the cheerful intelligence that the post on the \" Oubache \" had taken the oath of allegiance to the Old Dominion. During this interval, Clark established his courts, placed garrisons at Kaskaskia and Cahokia, successfully re-enlisted his men, sent word to have a fort, which proved the germ of Louisville, erected at the Falls of the Ohio, and dispatched Mr. Rocheblave, who had been commander at Kaskaskia, as a prisoner of war to Richmond. In October the County of Illinois was established by the Legislature of Virginia, John Todd appointed Lieutenant Colonel and Civil Governor, and in November General Clark and his men received the thanks of the Old Dominion through their Legislature. In a speech a few days afterward, Clark made known fully to the natives his plans, and at its close all came forward and swore alle giance to the Long Knives. While he was doing this Governor Hamilton, having made his various arrangements, had left Detroit and moved down the Wabash to Vincennes intending to operate from that point in reducing the Illinois posts, and then proceed on down to Kentucky and drive the rebels from the West. Gen. Clark had, on the return of M. Gibault, dispatched Captain Helm, of Fauquier County, Virginia, with an attend ant named Henry, across the Illinois prairies to command the fort. Hamilton knew nothing of the capitulation of the post, and was greatly surprised on his arrival to be confronted by Capt. Helm, who, standing at the entrance of the fort by a loaded cannon ready to fire upon his assail ants, demanded upon what terms Hamilton demanded possession of the fort. Being granted the rights of a prisoner of war, he surrendered to the British General, who could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the force in the garrison. Hamilton, not realizing the character of the men with whom he was contending, gave up his intended campaign for the Winter, sent his four hundred Indian warriors to prevent troops from coming down the Ohio,"], [51, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 53 and to annoy the Americans in all ways, and sat quietly down to pass the Winter. Information of all these proceedings having reached Clark, he saw that immediate and decisive action was necessary, and that unless he captured Hamilton, Hamilton would capture him. Clark received the news on the 29th of January, 1779, and on February 4th, having suffi ciently garrisoned Kaskaskia and Cahokia, he sent down the Mississippi a \" battoe,\" as Major Bowman writes it, in order to ascend the Ohio and Wabash, and operate with the land forces gathering for the fray. On the next day, Clark, with his little force of one hundred and twenty men, set out for the post, and after incredible hard marching through much mud, the ground being thawed by the incessant spring rains, on the 22d reached the fort, and being joined by his \" battoe,\" at once commenced the attack on the post. The aim of the American back woodsman was unerring, and on the 24th the garrison surrendered to the intrepid boldness of Clark. The French were treated with great kind ness, and gladly renewed their allegiance to Virginia. Hamilton was sent as a prisoner to Virginia, where he was kept in close confinement. During his command of the British frontier posts, he had offered prizes to the Indians for all the scalps of Americans they would bring to him, and had earned in consequence thereof the title \" Hair-buyer General,\" by which he was ever afterward known. Detroit was now without doubt within easy reach of the enterprising Virginian, could he but raise the necessary force. Governor Henry being apprised of this, promised him the needed reinforcement, and Clark con cluded to wait until he could capture and sufficiently garrison the posts. Had Clark failed in this bold undertaking, and Hamilton succeeded in uniting the western Indians for the next Spring's campaign, the West would indeed have been swept from the Mississippi to the Allegheny Mountains, and the great blow struck, which had been contemplated from the commencement, by the British. \" But for this small army of dripping, but fearless Virginians, the union of all the tribes from Georgia to Maine against the colonies might have been effected, and the whole current of our history changed.\" At this time some fears were entertained by the Colonial Govern ments that the Indians in the North and Northwest were inclining to the British, and under the instructions of Washington, now Commander-in- Chief of the Colonial army, and so bravely fighting for American inde pendence, armed forces were sent against the Six Nations, and upon the Ohio frontier, Col. Bowman, acting under the same general's orders, inarched against Indians within the present limits of that State. These expeditions were in the main successful, and the Indians were compelled to sue for peace."], [52, "54 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. During this same year (1779) the famous \" Land Laws\" of Virginia were passed. The passage of these laws was of more consequence to the pioneers of Kentucky and the Northwest than the gaining of a few Indian conflicts. These laws confirmed in main all grants made, and guaranteed to all actual settlers their rights and privileges. After providing for the settlers, the laws provided for selling the balance of the public lands at forty cents per acre. To carry the Land Laws into effect, the Legislature sent four Virginians westward to attend to the various claims, over many of which great confusion prevailed concerning their validity. These gentlemen opened their court on October 13, 1779, at St. Asaphs, and continued until April 26, 1780, when they adjourned, having decided three thousand claims. They were succeeded by the surveyor, who came in the person of Mr. George May, and assumed his duties on the 10th day of the month whose name he bore. With the opening of the next year (1780) the troubles concerning the navigation of the Missis sippi commenced. The Spanish Government exacted such measures in relation to its trade as to cause the overtures made to the United States to be rejected. The American Government considered they had a right to navigate its channel. To enforce their claims, a fort was erected below the mouth of the Ohio on the Kentucky side of the river. The settle ments in Kentucky were being rapidly filled by emigrants. It was dur ing this year that the first seminary of learning was established in the West in this young and enterprising Commonwealth. The settlers here did not look upon the building of this fort in a friendly manner, as it aroused the hostility of the Indians. Spain had been friendly to the Colonies during their struggle for independence, and though for a while this friendship appeared in danger from the refusal of the free navigation of the river, j7et it was finally settled to the satisfaction of both nations. The Winter of 1779-80 was one of the most unusually severe ones ever experienced in the West. The Indians always referred to it as the \"Great Cold.\" Numbers of wild animals perished, and not a few pioneers lost their lives. The following Summer a party of Canadians and Indians attacked St. Louis, and attempted to take possession of it in consequence of the friendly disposition of Spain to the revolting colonies. They met with such a determined resistance on the part of the inhabitants, even the women taking part in the battle, that they were compelled to abandon the contest. They also made an attack on the settlements in Kentucky, but, becoming alarmed in some unaccountable manner, they fled the country in great haste. About this time arose the question in the Colonial Congress con cerning the western lands claimed by Virginia, New York, Massachusetts"], [53, "55 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. and Connecticut. The agitation concerning this subject finally led New York, on the 19th of February, 1780, to pass a law giving to the dele gates of that State in Congress the power to cede her western lands for the benefit of the United States. This law was laid before Congress during the next month, but no steps were taken concerning it until Sep tember 6th, when a resolution passed that body calling upon the States claiming western lands to release their claims in favor of the whole body. This basis formed the union, and was the first after all of those legislative measures which resulted in the creation of the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In December of the same year, the plan of conquering Detroit again arose. The conquest might have easily been effected by Clark had the necessary aid been furnished him. Nothing decisive was done, yet the heads of the Government knew that the safety of the Northwest from British invasion lay in the capture and retention of that important post, the only unconquered one in the territory. Before the close of the year, Kentucky was divided into the Coun ties of Lincoln, Fayette and Jefferson, and the act establishing the Town of Louisville was passed. This same year is also noted in the annals of American history as .the year in which occurred Arnold's treason to the United States. Virginia, in accordance with the resolution of Congress, on the 2d day of January, 1781, agreed to yield her western lands to the United States upon certain conditions, which Congress would not accede to, and the Act of Cession, on the part of the Old Dominion, failed, nor was anything farther done until 1783. During all that time the Colonies were busily engaged in the struggle with the mother country, and in consequence thereof but little heed was given to the western settlements. Upon the 16th of April, 1781, the first birth north of the Ohio River of American parentage occurred, being that of Mary Heckewelder, daughter of the widely known Moravian missionary, whose band of Christian Indians suffered in after years a horrible massacre by the hands of the frontier settlers, who had been exasperated by the murder of several of their neighbors, and in their rage committed, without regard to humanity, a deed which forever afterwards cast a shade' of shame upon their lives. For this and kindred outrages on the part of the whites, the Indians committed many deeds of cruelty which darken the years of 1771 and 1772 in the history of the Northwest. During the year 1782 a number of battles among the Indians and frontiersmen occurred, and between the Moravian Indians and the Wyan dots. In these, horrible acts of cruelty were practised on the captives, many of such dark deeds transpiring under the leadership of the notorious"], [54, "56 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. frontier outlaw, Simon Girty, whose name, as well as those of his brothers, was a terror to women and children. These occurred chiefly in the Ohio valleys. Cotemporary with them were several engagements in Kentucky, in which the famous Daniel Boone engaged, and who, often by his skill and knowledge of Indian warfare, saved the outposts from cruel destruc- INDIANS ATTACKING FRONTIERSMEN. tion. By the close of the year victory had perched upon the American banner, and on the 30th of November, provisional articles of peace had been arranged between the Commissioners of England and her uncon querable colonies. Cornwallis had been defeated on the 19th of October preceding, and the liberty of America was assured. On the 19th of April following, the anniversary of the battle of Lexington, peace was"], [55, "57 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. proclaimed to the army of the United States, and on the 3d of the next September, the definite treaty which ended our revolutionary struggle was concluded. By the terms of that treaty, the boundaries of the West were as follows : On the north the line was to extend along the center of the Great Lakes ; from the western point of Lake Superior to Long Lake ; thence to the Lake of the Woods ; thence to the head of the Mississippi River; down its center to the 31st parallel of latitude, then on that line east to the head of the Appalachicola River ; down its center to its junc tion with the Flint ; thence straight to the head of St. Mary's River, and thence down along its center to the Atlantic Ocean. Following the cessation of hostilities with England, several posts were still occupied by the British in the North and West. Among these was Detroit, still in the hands of the enemy. Numerous engagements with the Indians throughout Ohio and Indiana occurred, upon whose lands adventurous whites would settle ere the title had been acquired by the proper treaty. To remedy this latter evil, Congress appointed commissioners to treat with the natives and purchase their lands, and prohibited the set tlement of the territory until this could be done. Before the close of the year another attempt was made to capture Detroit, which was, however, not pushed, and Virginia, no longer feeling the interest in the Northwest she had formerly done, withdrew her troops, having on the 20th of December preceding authorized the whole of her possessions to be deeded to the United States. This was clone on the 1st of March following, and the Northwest Territory passed from the control of the Old Dominion. To Gen. Clark and his soldiers, however, she gave a tract of one hundred and fifty thousand acres of land, to be situated any where north of the Ohio wherever they chose to locate them. They selected the region opposite the falls of the Ohio, where is now the dilapidated village of Clarksville, about midway between the Cities of New Albany and Jeffer sonville, Indiana. While the frontier remained thus, and Gen. Haldimand at Detroit refused to evacuate alleging that he had no orders from his King to do so, settlers were rapidly gathering about the inland forts. In the Spring of 1784, Pittsburgh was regularly laid out, and from the journal of Arthur Lee, who passed through the town soon after on his way to the Indian council at Fort Mclntosh, we suppose it was not very prepossessing in appearance. He says : \" Pittsburgh , is inhabited almost entirely by Scots and Irish, who live in paltry log houses, and are as dirty as if in the north of Ireland or even Scotland. There is a great deal of trade carried on, the goods being bought at the vast expense of forty-five shillings per pound from Phila-"], [56, "58 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. delphia and Baltimore. They take in the shops flour, wheat, skins and money. There are in the town four attorneys, two doctors, and not a priest of any persuasion, nor church nor chapel.\" Kentucky at this time contained thirty thousand inhabitants, and was beginning to discuss measures for a separation from Virginia. A land office was opened at Louisville, and measures were adopted to take defensive precaution against the Indians who were yet, in some instances, incited to deeds of violence by the British. Before the close of this year, 1784, the military claimants of land began to occupy them, although no entries were recorded until 1787. The Indian title to the Northwest was not yet extinguished. They held large tracts of lands, and in order to prevent bloodshed Congress adopted means for treaties with the original owners and provided for the surveys of the lands gained thereby, as well as for those north of the Ohio, now in its possession. On January 31, 1786, a treaty was made with the Wabash Indians. The treaty of Fort Stanwix had been made in 1784. That at Fort Mclntosh in 1785, and through these much land was gained. The Wabash Indians, however, afterward refused to comply with the provisions. of the treaty made with them, and in order to compel their adherence to its provisions, force was used. During the year 1786, the free navigation of the Mississippi came up in Congress, and caused various discussions, which resulted in no definite action, only serving to excite speculation in regard to the western lands. Congress had promised bounties of land to the soldiers of the Revolution, but owing to the unsettled condition of affairs along the Mississippi respecting its naviga tion, and the trade of the Northwest, that body had, in 1783, declared its inability to fulfill these promises until a treaty could be concluded between the two Governments. Before the close of the year 1786, how ever, it was able, through the treaties with the Indians, to allow some grants and the settlement thereon, and on the 14th of September Con necticut ceded to the General Government the tract of land known as the \" Connecticut Reserve,\" and before the close of the following year a large tract of land north of the Ohio was sold to a company, who at ouce took measures to settle it. By the provisions of this grant, the company were to pay the United States one dollar per acre, subject to a deduction of one-third for bad lands and other contingencies. They received 750,000 acres, bounded on the south by the Ohio, on the east by the seventh range of townships, on the west by the sixteenth range, and on the north by a line so drawn as to make the grant complete without the reservations. In addition to this, Congress afterward granted 100,000 acres to actual settlers, and 214,285 acres as army bounties under the resolutions of 1789 and 1790."], [57, "59 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. While Dr. Cutler, one of the agents of the company, was pressing its claims before Congress, that body was bringing into form an ordinance for the political and social organization of this Territory. When the cession was made by Virginia, in 1784, a plan was offered, but rejected. A motion had been made to strike from the proposed plan the prohibition of slavery, which prevailed. The plan was then discussed and altered, and finally passed unanimously, with the exception of South Carolina. By this proposition, the Territory was to have been divided into states A PRAIRIE STORM. by parallels and meridian lines. This, it was thought, would make ten states, which were to have been named as follows \u2014 beginning at the northwest corner and going southwardly : Sylvania, Michigania, Cher sonesus, Assenisipia, Metropotamia, Ulenoia, Saratoga, Washington, Poly potamia and Pelisipia. There was a more serious objection to this plan than its category of names, \u2014 the boundaries. The root of the difficulty was in the resolu tion of Congress passed in October, 1780, which fixed the boundaries of the ceded lands to be from one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles"], [58, "60 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. square. These resolutions being presented to the Legislatures of Vir ginia and Massachusetts, they desired a change, and in July, 1786, the subject was taken up in Congress, and changed to favor a division into not more than five states, and not less than three. This was approved by the State Legislature of Virginia. The subject of the Government was again taken up by Congress in 1786, and discussed throughout that year and until July, 1787, when the famous \" Compact of 1787 \" was passed, and the foundation of the government of the Northwest laid. This com pact is fully discussed and explained in the history of Illinois in this book, and to it the reader is referred. The passage of this act and the grant to the New England Company was soon followed by an application to the Government by John Cleves Symmes, of New Jersey, for a grant of the land between the Miamis. This gentleman had visited these lands soon after the treaty of 1786, and, being greatly pleased with them, offered similar terms to those given to the New England Company. The petition was referred to the Treasury Board with power to act, and a contract was concluded the following year. During the Autumn the directors of the New England Company were preparing to occupy their grant the following Spring, and upon the 23d of November made arrangements for a party of forty-seven men, under the superintendency of Gen. Rufus Putnam, to set forward. Six boat-builders were to leave at once, and on the first of January the sur veyors and their assistants, twenty-six in number, were to meet at Hart ford and proceed on their journey westward ; the remainder to follow as soon as possible. Congress, in the meantime, upon the 3d of October, had ordered seven hundred troops for defense of the western settlers, and to prevent unauthorized intrusions ; and two days later appointed Arthur St. Clair Governor of the Territory of the Northwest. AMERICAN SETTLEMENTS. The civil organization of the Northwest Territory was now com plete, and notwithstanding the uncertainty of Indian affairs, settlers from the East began to come into the country rapidly. The New England Company sent their men during the Winter of 1787-8 pressing on over the Alleghenies by the old Indian path which had been opened into Braddock's road, and which has since been made a national turnpike from Cumberland westward. Through the weary winter days they toiled on, and by April were all gathered on the Yohiogany, where boats had been built, and at once started for the Muskingum. Here they arrived on the 7th of that month, and unless the Moravian missionaries be regarded as the pioneers of Ohio, this little band can justly claim that honor."], [59, "61 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. Gen. St. Clair, the appointed Governor of the Northwest, not having yet arrived, a set of laws were passed, written out, and published by being nailed to a tree in the embryo town, and Jonathan Meigs appointed to administer them. Washington in writing of this, the first American settlement in the Northwest, said : \" No colony in America was ever settled under such favorable auspices as that which has just commenced at Muskingum. Information, property and strength will be its characteristics. I know many of its settlers personally, and there never were men better calcu lated to promote the welfare of such a community.\" A PIONEER DWELLING. On the 2d of July a meeting of the directors and agents was held on the banks of the Muskingum, \" for the purpose of naming the new- born city and its squares.\" As yet the settlement was known as the \"Muskingum,\" but that was now changed to the name Marietta, in honor of Marie Antoinette. The square upon which the block -houses stood was called \"Campus Martins ;\" square number 19, \" Capitolium ;\" square number 61, \" Cecilia ;\" and the great road through the covert way, \" Sacra Via.\" Two days after, an oration was delivered by James M. Varnum, who with S. H. Parsons and John Armstrong had been appointed to the judicial bench of the territory on the 16th of October, 1787. On July 9, Gov. St. Clair arrived, and the colony began to assume form. The act of 1787 provided two district grades of government for the Northwest,"], [60, "62 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. under the first of which the whole power was invested in the hands of a governor and three district judges. This was immediately formed upon the Governor's arrival, and the first laws of the colony passed on the 25th of July. These provided for the organization of the militia, and on the next day appeared the Governor's proclamation, erecting all that country that had been ceded by the Indians east of the Scioto River into the County of Washington. From that time forward, notwithstanding the doubts yet existing as to the Indians, all Marietta prospered, and on the 2d of September the first court of the territory was held with imposing ceremonies. The emigration westward at this time was very great. The com mander at Fort Harmer, at the mouth of the Muskingum, reported four thousand five hundred persons as having passed that post between Feb ruary and June, 1788 \u2014 many of whom would have purchased of the \"Associates,\" as the New England Company was called, had they been ready to receive them. On the 26th of November, 1787, Symmes issued a pamphlet stating the terms of his contract and the plan of sale he intended to adopt. In January, 1788, Matthias Denman, of New Jersey, took an active interest in Symmes' purchase, and located among other tracts the sections upon which Cincinnati has been built. Retaining one-third of this locality, he sold the other two-thirds to Robert Patterson and John Filson, and the three, about August, commenced to lay out a town on the spot, which was designated as being opposite Licking River, to the mouih of which they proposed to have a road cut from Lexington. The naming of the town is thus narrated in the \"Western Annals \" : \u2014 \" Mr. Filson, who had been a schoolmaster, was appointed to name the town, and, in respect to its situation, and as if with a prophetic perception of the mixed race that were to inhabit it in after days, he named it Losantiville, which, being interpreted, means : ville, the town ; anti, against or opposite to ; os, the mouth ; L. of Licking.\" Meanwhile, in July, Symmes got thirty persons and eight four-horse teams under way for the West. These reached Limestone (now Mays ville) in September, where were several persons from Redstone. Here Mr. Symmes tried to found a settlement, but the great freshet of 1789 caused the \" Point,\" as it was and is yet called, to be fifteen feet under water, and the settlement to be abandoned. The little band of settlers removed to the mouth of the Miami. Before Symmes and his colony left the \" Point,\" two settlements had been made on his purchase. The first was by Mr. Stiltes, the original projector of the whole plan, who, with a colony of Redstone people, had located at the mouth of the Miami, whither Symmes went with his Maysville colony. Here a clearing had"], [61, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 63 been made by the Indians owing to the great fertility of the soil. Mr. Stiltes with his colony came to this place on the 18th of November, 1788, with twenty-six persons, and, building a block-house, prepared to remain through the Winter. They named the settlement Columbia. Here they were kindly treated by the Indians, but suffered greatly from the flood of 1789. On the 4th of March, 1789, the Constitution of the United States went into operation, and on April 30, George Washington was inaug urated President of the American people, and during the next Summer, an Indian war was commenced by the tribes north of the Ohio. The President at first used pacific means ; but these failing, he sent General Harmer against the hostile tribes. He destroyed several villages, but BREAKING PRAIRIE. was defeated in two battles, near the present City of Fort Wayne, Indiana. From this time till the close of 1795, the principal events were the wars with the various Indian tribes. In 1796, General St. Clair was appointed in command, and marched against the Indians ; but while he was' encamped on a stream, the St. Mary, a branch of the Maumee, he was attacked and defeated with the loss of six hundred men. General Wayne was now sent against the savages. In August, 1794, he met them near the rapids of the Maumee, and gained a complete victory. This success, followed by vigorous measures, compelled the Indians to sue for peace, and on the 30th of July, the following year, the treaty of Greenville was signed by the principal chiefs, by which a large tract of country was ceded to the United States. Before proceeding in our narrative, we will pause to notice Fort Washington, erected in the early part of this war on the site of Cincinnati. Nearly all of the great cities of the Northwest, and indeed of the"], [62, "64 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. whole country, have had their nuclei in those rude pioneer structures, known as forts or stockades. Thus Forts Dearborn, Washington, Pon ehartrain, mark the original sites of the now proud Cities of Chicago, Cincinnati and Detroit. So of most of the flourishing cities east and west of the Mississippi. Fort Washington, erected by Doughty in 1790, was a rude but highly^ interesting structure. It was composed of a number of strongly-built hewed log cabins. Those designed for soldiers' barracks were a story and a half high, while those composing the officers quarters were more imposing and more conveniently arranged and furnished. The whole were so placed as to form a hollow square, enclosing about an acre of ground, with a block house at each of the four angles. The logs for the construction of this fort were cut from the ground upon which it was erected. It stood between Third and Fourth Streets of the present city (Cincinnati) extending east of Eastern Row, now Broadway, which was then a narrow alley, and the eastern boundary of of the town as it was originally laid out. On the bank of the river, immediately in front of the fort, was an appendage of the fort, called the Artificer's Yard. It contained about two acres of ground, enclosed by small contiguous buildings, occupied by workshops and quarters of laborers. Within this enclosure there was a large two-story frame house, familiarly called the \" Yellow House,\" built for the accommodation of the Quartermaster General. For many years this was the best finished and most commodious edifice in the Queen City. Fort Washington was for some time the headquarters of both the civil and military governments of the Northwestern Territory. Following the consummation of the treaty various gigantic land spec ulations were entered into by different persons, who hoped to obtain from the Indians in Michigan and northern Indiana, large tracts of lands. These were generally discovered in time to prevent the outrageous schemes from being carried out, and from involving the settlers in war. On October 27, 1795, the treaty between the United States and Spain was signed, whereby the free navigation of the Mississippi was secured. No sooner had the treaty of 1795 been ratified than settlements began to pour rapidly into the West. The great event of the year 1796 was the occupation of that part of the Northwest including Michigan, which was this year, under the provisions of the treaty, evacuated by the British forces. The United States, owing to certain conditions, did not feel justified in addressing the authorities in Canada in relation to Detroit and other frontier posts. When at last the British authorities were called to give them up, they at once complied, and General Wayne, who had done so much to preserve the frontier settlements, and who, before the year's close, sickened and died near Erie, transferred his head-"], [63, "65 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. quarters to the neighborhood of the lakes, where a county named after him was formed, which included the northwest of Ohio, all of Michigan, and the northeast of Indiana. During this same year settlements were formed at the present City of Chillicothe, along the Miami from Middle town to Piqua, while in the more distant West, settlers and speculators began to appear in great numbers. In September, the City of Cleveland was laid out, and during the Summer and Autumn, Samuel Jackson and Jonathan Sharpless erected the first manufactory of paper \u2014 the \" Red stone Paper Mill\" \u2014 in the West. St. Louis contained some seventy houses, and Detroit over three hundred, and along the river, contiguous to it, were more than three thousand inhabitants, mostly French Canadians, Indians and half-breeds, scarcely any Americans venturing yet into that part of the Northwest. The election of representatives for the territory had taken place, and on the 4th of February, 1799, they convened at Losanti ville \u2014 now known as Cincinnati, having been named so by Gov. St. Clair, and considered the capital of the Territory \u2014 to nominate persons from whom the members of the Legislature were to be chosen in accordance with a previous ordinance. This nomination being made, the Assembly adjourned until the 16th of the following September. From those named the President selected as members of the council, Henry Vandenburg, of Vincennes, Robert Oliver, of Marietta, James Findlay and Jacob Burnett, of Cincinnati, and David Vance, of Vanceville. On the 16th of September the Territorial Legislature met, and on the 24th the two houses were duly organized, Henry Vandenburg being elected President of the Council. The message of Gov. St. Clair was addressed to the Legislature September 20th, and on October 13th that body elected as a delegate to Congress Gen. Wm. Henry Harrison, who received eleven of the votes cast, being a majority of one over his opponent, Arthur St. Clair, son of Gen. St. Clair. The whole number of acts passed at this session, and approved by the Governor, were thirty-seven \u2014 eleven others were passed, but received his veto. The most important of those passed related to the militia, to the administration, and to taxation. On the 19th of December this pro tracted session of the first Legislature in the West was closed, and on the 80th of December the President nominated Charles Willing Bryd to the office of Secretary of the Territory vice Wm. Henry Harrison, elected to Congress. The Senate confirmed his nomination the next day."], [64, "66 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. DIVISION OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. The increased emigration to the Northwest, the extent of the domain, and the inconvenient modes of travel, made it very difficult to conduct the ordinary operations of government, and rendered the efficient action of courts almost impossible. To remedy this, it was deemed advisable to divide the territory for civil purposes. Congress, in 1800, appointed a committee to examine the question and report some means for its solution. This committee, on the 3d of March, reported that : \"In the three western countries there has been but one court having cognizance of crimes, in five years, and the immunity which offenders experience attracts, as to an asylum, the most vile and abandoned crim inals, and at the same time deters useful citizens from making settlements in such society. The extreme necessity of judiciary attention and assist ance is experienced in civil as well as in criminal cases. * * * * To minister a remedy to these and other evils, it occurs to this committee tbat it is expedient that a division of said territory into two distinct and separate governments should be made ; and that such division be made by a line beginning at the mouth of the Great Miami River, running directly north until it intersects the boundary between the United States and Canada.\" The report was accepted by Congress, and, in accordance with its suggestions, that body passed an Act extinguishing the Northwest Terri tory, which Act was approved May 7. Among its provisions were these : \" That from and after July 4 next, all that part of the Territory of the United States northwest of the Ohio River, which lies to the westward of a line beginning at a point on the Ohio, opposite to the mouth of the Kentucky River, and running thence to Fort Recovery, and thence north until it shall intersect the territorial line between the United States and Canada, shall, for the purpose of temporary government, constitute a separate territory, and be called the Indiana Territory.\" After providing for the exercise of the civil and criminal powers of the territories, and other provisions, the Act further provides: \" That until it shall otherwise be ordered by the Legislatures of the said Territories, respectively, Chillicothe on the Scioto River shall be the seat of government of the Territory of the United States northwest of the Ohio River ; and that St. Vincennes on the Wabash River shall be the seat of government for the Indiana Territory.\" Gen. Wm. Henry Harrison was appointed Governor of the Indiana Territory, and entered upon his duties about a year later. Connecticut also about this time released her claims to the reserve, and in March a law"], [65, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 67 was passed accepting this cession. Settlements had been made upon thirty-five of the townships in the reserve, mills had been built, and seven hundred miles of road cut in various directions. On the 3d of November the General Assembly met at Chillicothe. Near the close of the year, the first missionary of the Connecticut Reserve came, who found no township containing more than eleven families. It was upon the first of October that the secret treaty had been made between Napoleon and the King of Spain, whereby the latter agreed to cede to France the province of Louisiana. In January, 1802, the Assembly of the Northwestern Territory char tered the college at Athens. From the earliest dawn of the western colonies, education was promptly provided for, and as early as 1787, newspapers were issued from Pittsburgh and Kentucky, and largely read throughout the frontier settlements. Before the close of this year, the Congress of the United States granted to the citizens of the Northwestern territory the formation of a State government. One of the provisions of the \"compact of 1787\" provided that whenever the number of inhabit ants within prescribed limits exceeded 45,000, they should be entitled to a separate government. The prescribed limits of Ohio contained, from a census taken to ascertain the legality of the act, more than that number, and on the 30th of April, 1802, Congress passed the act defining its limits, and on the 29th of November the Constitution of the new State of Ohio, so named from the beautiful river forming its southern boundary, came into existence. The exact limits of Lake Michigan were not then known, but the territory now included within the State of Michigan was wholly within the territory of Indiana. Gen. Harrison, while residing at Vincennes, made several treaties with the Indians, thereby gaining large tracts of lands. The next year is memorable in the history of the West for the purchase of Louisiana from France by the United States for 115,000,000. Thus by a peaceful mode, the domain of the United States was extended over a large tract of country west of the Mississippi, and was for a time under the jurisdiction of the Northwest government, and, as has been mentioned in the early part of this narrative, was called the \" New Northwest.\" The limits of this history will not allow a description of its territory. The same year large grants of land were obtained from the Indians, and the House of Representatives of the new State of Ohio signed a bill respecting the College Township in the district of Cincinnati. Before the close of the year, Gen. Harrison obtained additional grants of lands from the various Indian nations in Indiana and the present limits of Illinois, and on the 18th of August, 1804, completed a treaty at St. Louis, whereby over 51,000,000 acres of lands were obtained from the"], [66, "68 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. aborigines. Measures were also taken to learn the condition of affairs in and about Detroit. C. Jouett, the Indian agent in Michigan, still a part of Indiana Terri tory, reported as follows upon the condition of matters at that post : \" The Town of Detroit.\u2014 The charter, which is for fifteen miles square, was granted in the time of Louis XIV. of France, aud is now, from the best information I have been able to get, at Quebec. Of those two hundred and twenty-five acres, only four are occupied by the town and Fort Lenault. The remainder is a common, except twenty-four acres, which were added twenty years ago to a farm belonging to Wm. Macomb. * * * A stockade incloses the town, fort and citadel. The pickets, as well as the public houses, are in a state of gradual decay. The streets are narrow, straight and regular, and intersect each other at right angles. The houses are, for the most part, low and inelegant.\" During this year, Congress granted a township of land for the sup port of a college, and began to offer inducements for settlers in these wilds, and the country now comprising the State of Michigan began to fill rapidly with settlers along its southern borders. This same year, also, a law was passed organizing the Southwest Territory, dividing it into two portions, the Territory of New Orleans, which city was made the seat of government, and the District of Louisiana, which was annexed to the domain of Gen. Harrison. On the 11th of January, 1805, the Territory of Michigan was formed, Wm. Hull was appointed governor, with headquarters at Detroit, the change to take effect on June 30. On the 11th of that month, a fire occurred at Detroit, which destroyed almost every building in the place. When the officers of the new territory reached the post, they found it in ruins, and the inhabitants scattered throughout the country. Rebuild ing, however, soon commenced, and ere long the town contained more houses than before the fire, and many of them much better built. While this was being done, Indiana had passed to the second grade of government, and through her General Assembly had obtained large tracts of land from the Indian tribes. To all this the celebrated Indian, Tecumthe or Tecumseh, vigorously protested, and it was the main cause of his attempts to unite the various Indian tribes in a conflict with the settlers. To obtain a full account of these attempts, the workings of the British, and the signal failure, culminating in the death of Tecumseh at the battle of the Thames, and the close of the war of 1812 in the Northwest, we will step aside in our story, and relate the principal events of his life, and his connection with this conflict."], [67, "69 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. TECUMSEH, THE SHAWANOE CHIEFTAIN."], [68, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 70 TECUMSEH, AND THE WAR OF 1812. This famous Indian chief was born about the year 1768, not far from the site of the present City of Piqua, Ohio. His father, Puckeshinwa, was a member of the Kisopok tribe of the Swanoese nation, and his mother, Methontaske, was a member of the Turtle tribe of the same people. They removed from Florida about the middle of the last century to the birthplace of Tecumseh. In 1774, his father, who had risen to be chief, was slain at the battle of Point Pleasant, and not long after Tecum seh, by his bravery, became the leader of his tribe. In 1795 he was declared chief, and then lived at Deer Creek, near the site of the present City of Urbana. He remained here about one year, when he returned to Piqua, and in 1798, he went to White River, Indiana. In 1805, he and his brother, Laulewasikan (Open Door), who had announced himself as a prophet, went to a tract of land on the Wabash River, given them by the Pottawatomies and Kickapoos. From this date the chief comes into prominence. He was now about thirty-seven years of age, was five feet and ten inches in height, was stoutly built, and possessed of enormous powers of endurance. His countenance was naturally pleas ing, and he was, in general, devoid of those savage attributes possessed by most Indians. It is stated be could read and write, and had a confi dential secretary and adviser, named Billy Caldwell, a half-breed, who afterward became chief of the Pottawatomies. He occupied the first house built on the site of Chicago. At this time, Tecumseh entered upon the great work of his life. He had long objected to the grants of land made by the Indians to the whites, and determined to unite all the Indian tribes into a league, in order that no treaties or grants of land could be made save by the consent of this confederation. He traveled constantly, going from north to south ; from the south to the north, everywhere urging the Indians to this step. He was a matchless orator, and his burning words had their effect. Gen. Harrison, then Governor of Indiana, by watching the move ments of the Indians, became convinced that a grand conspiracy was forming, and made preparations to defend the settlements. Tecumseh's plan was similar to Pontiac's, elsewhere described, and to the cunning artifice of that chieftain was added his own sagacity. During the year 1809, Tecumseh and the prophet were actively pre paring for the work. In that year, Gen. Harrison entered into a treaty with the Delawares, Kickapoos, Pottawatomies, Miamis, Eel River Indians and Weas, in which these tribes ceded to the whites certain lands upon the Wabash, to all of which Tecumseh entered a bitter protest, averring"], [69, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 71 as one principal reason that he did not want the Indians to give up any lands north and west of the Ohio River. Tecumseh, in August, 1810, visited the General at Vincennes and held a council relating to the grievances of the Indians. Becoming unduly angry at this conference he was dismissed from the village, and soon after departed to incite the southern Indian tribes to the conflict. Gen. Harrison determined to move upon the chief's headquarters at Tippecanoe, and for this purpose went about sixty-five miles up the Wabash, where he built Fort Harrison. From this place he went to the prophet's town, where he informed the Indians he had no hostile inten tions, provided they were true to the existing treaties. He encamped near the village early in October, and on the morning of November 7, he was attacked by a large force of the Indians, and the famous battle of Tippecanoe occurred. The Indians were routed and their town broken up. Tecumseh returning not long after, was greatly exasperated at his brother, the prophet, even threatening to kill him for rashly precipitating the war, and foiling his (Tecumseh's) plans. Tecumseh sent word to Gen. Harrison that he was now returned from the South, and was ready to visit the President as had at one time previously been proposed. Gen. Harrison informed him he could not go as a chief, which method Tecumseh desired, and the visit was never made. In June of the following year, he visited the Indian agent at Fort Wayne. Here he disavowed any intention to make a war against the United States, and reproached Gen. Harrison for marching against his people. The agent replied to this ; Tecumseh listened with a cold indif ference, and after making a few general remarks, with a haughty air drew his blanket about him, left the council house, and departed for Fort Mai den, in Upper Canada, where he joined the British standard. He remained under this Government, doing effective work for the Crown while engaged in the war of 1812 which now opened. He was, however, always humane in his treatment of the prisoners, never allow ing his warriors to ruthlessly mutilate the bodies of those slain, or wan tonly murder the captive. In the Summer of 1813, Perry's victory on Lake Erie occurred, and shortly after active preparations were made to capture Maiden. On the 27th of September, the American army, under Gen. Harrison, set sail for the shores of Canada, and in a few hours stood around the ruins of Mai den, from which the British army, under Proctor, had retreated to Sand wich, intending to make its way to the heart of Canada by the Valley of the Thames. On the 29th Gen. Harrison was at Sandwich, and Gen. McArthur took possession of Detroit and the territory of Michigan."], [70, "72 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. On the 2d of October, the Americans began their pursuit of Proctor, whom they overtook on the 5th, and the battle of the Thames followed. Early in the engagement, Tecumseh who was at the head of the column of Indians was slain, and they, no longer hearing the voice of their chief tain, fled. The victory was decisive, and practically closed the war in the Northwest. INDIANS ATTACKING A STOCKADE. Just who*killed the great chief has been a matter of much dispute ; but the weight of opinion awards the act to Col. Richard M. Johnson, who fired at him with a pistol, the shot proving fatal. In 1805 occurred Burr's Insurrection. He took possession of a beautiful island in the Ohio, after the killing of Hamilton, and is charged by many with attempting to set up an independent government. His plans Avere frustrated by the general government, his property confiscated and he was compelled to flee the country for safety."], [71, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 73 In January, 1807, Governor Hull, of Michigan Territory, made a treaty with the Indians, whereby all that peninsula was ceded to the United States. Before the close of the year, a stockade was built about Detroit. It was also during this year that Indiana and Illinois endeavored to obtain the repeal of that section of the compact of 1787, whereby slavery was excluded from the Northwest Territory. These attempts, however, all signally failed. In 1809 it was deemed advisable to divide the Indiana Territory. This was done, and the Territory of Illinois was formed from the western part, the seat of government being fixed at Kaskaskja. The next j'ear, the intentions of Tecumseh manifested themselves in open hostilities, and then began the events already narrated. While this war was in progress, emigration to the West went on with surprising rapidity. In 1811, under Mr. Roosevelt of New York, the first steamboat trip was made on the Ohio, much to the astonishment of the natives, many of whom fled in terror at the appearance of the \" monster.\" It arrived at Louisville on the 10th day of October. At the close of the first week of January, 1812, it arrived at Natchez, after being nearly overwhelmed in the great earthquake which occurred while on its downward trip. The battle of the Thames was fought on October 6, 1813. It effectually closed hostilities in the Northwest, although peace was not fully restored until July 22, .1814, when a treaty was formed at Green ville, under the direction of General Harrison, between the United States and the Indian tribes, in which it was stipulated that the Indians should cease hostilities against the Americans if the war were continued. Such, happily, was not the case, and on the 24th of December the treaty of Ghent was signed by the representatives of England and the United States. This treaty was followed the next year by treaties with various Indian tribes throughout the West and Northwest, and quiet was again restored in this part of the new world. On the 18th of March, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city. It then had a population of 8,000 people, and was already noted for its manufacturing interests. On April 19, Indiana Territory^was allowed to form a state government. At that time there were thirteen counties organized, containing about sixty-three thousand inhabitants. The first election of state officers was held in August, when Jonathan Jennings was chosen Governor. The officers were sworn in on November 7, and on December 11, the State was formally admitted into the Union. For some time the seat of government was at Corydon, but a more central location being desirable, the present capital, Indianapolis (City of Indiana), was laid out January 1, 1825."], [72, "74 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. On the 28th of December the Bank of Illinois, at Shawneetown, was chartered, with a capital of $300,000. At this period all banks were under the control of the States, and were allowed to establish branches at different convenient points. Until this time Chillicothe and Cincinnati had in turn enjoyed the privileges of being the capital of Ohio. But the rapid settlement of the northern and eastern portions of the State demanded, as in Indiana, a more central location, and before the close of the year, the site of Col umbus was selected and surveyed as the future capital of the State. Banking had begun in Ohio as early as 1808, when the first bank was chartered at Marietta, but here as elsewhere it did not bring to the state the hoped-for assistance. It and other banks were subsequently unable to redeem their currency, and were obliged to suspend. In 1818, Illinois was made a state, and all the territory north of her northern limits was erected into a separate territory and joined to Mich igan for judicial purposes. By the following year, navigation of the lakes was increasing with great rapidity and affording an immense source of revenue to the dwellers in the Northwest, but it was not until 1826 that the trade was extended to Lake Michigan, or that steamships began to navigate the bosom of that inland sea. Until the year 1832, the commencement of the Black Hawk War, but few hostilities were experienced with the Indians. Roads were opened, canals were dug, cities were built, common schools were estab lished, universities were founded, many of which, especially the Michigan University, have achieved a world wide-reputation. The people were becoming wealthy. The domains of the United States had been extended, and had the sons of the forest been treated with honesty and justice, the record of many years would have been that of peace and continuous pros perity. BLACK HAWK AND THE BLACK HAWK WAR This conflict, though confined to Illinois, is an important epoch in the Northwestern history, being the last war with the Indians in this part of the United States. Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiah, or Black Hawk, was born in the principal Sac village, about three miles from the junction of Rock River with the Mississippi, in the year 1767. His father's name was Py-e-sa or Pahaes ; his grandfather's, Na-na-ma-kee, or the Thunderer. Black Hawk early distinguished himself as a warrior, and at the age of fifteen was permitted to paint and was ranked among the braves. About the year 1783, he went on an expedition against the enemies of his nation, the Osages, one"], [73, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 75 BLACK HAWK, THE SAC CHIEFTAIN."], [74, "76 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. of whom he killed and scalped, and for this deed of Indian bravery he was permitted to join in the scalp dance. Three or four years after he, at the head of two hundred braves, went on another expedition against the Osages, to avenge the murder of some women and children belonging to his own tribe. Meeting an equal number of Osage warriors, a fierce battle ensued, in which the latter tribe lost one-half their number. The Sacs lost only about nineteen warriors. He next attacked the Cherokees for a similar cause. In a severe battle with them, near the present City of St. Louis, his father was slain, and Black Hawk, taking possession of the \" Medicine Bag,\" at once announced himself chief of the Sac nation. He had now conquered the Cherokees, and about the year 1800, at the head of five hundred Sacs and Foxes, and a hundred Iowas, he waged war against the Osage nation and subdued it. For two years he battled successfully with other Indian tribes, all of whom he conquered. Black Hawk does not at any time seem to have been friendly to the Americans. When on a visit to St. Louis to see his \" Spanish Father,\" he declined to see any of the Americans, alleging, as a reason, he did not want two fathers. The treaty at St. Louis was consummated in 1804. The next year the United States Government erected a fort near the head of the Des Moines Rapids, called Fort Edwards. This seemed to enrage Black Hawk, who at once determined to capture Fort Madison, standing on the west side of the Mississippi above the mouth of the Des Moines River. The fort was garrisoned by about fifty men. Here he was defeated. The difficulties with the British Government arose about this time, and the War of 1812 followed. That government, extending aid to the Western Indians, by giving them arms and ammunition, induced them to remain hostile to the Americans. In August, 1812, Black Hawk, at the head of about five hundred braves, started to join the British forces at Detroit, passing on his way the site of Chicago, where the famous Fort Dearborn Massacre ' a few days before occurred. Of his connection with the British ... l eminent but little is known. In 1813 he with his little band descended the Mississippi, and attacking some United States troops at Fort Howard was defeated. In the early part of 1815, the Indian tribes west of the Mississippi were notified that peace had been declared between the United States and England, and nearly all hostilities had ceased. Black Hawk did not sign any treaty, however, until May of the following year. He then recog nized the validity of the treaty at St. Louis in 1804. From the time of signing this treaty in 1816, until the breaking out of the war in 1832, he aud his band passed their time in the common pursuits of Indian life. Ten years before the commencement of this war, the Sac and Fox"], [75, "77 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. Indians were urged to join the Iowas on the west bank of the Father of Waters. All were agreed, save the band known as the British Band, of which Black Hawk was leader. He strenuously objected to the removal, and was induced to comply only after being threatened with the power of the Government. This and various actions on the part of the white set tlers provoked Black Hawk and his band to attempt the capture of his native village now occupied by the whites. The war followed. He and his actions were undoubtedly misunderstood, and had his wishes been acquiesced in at the beginning of the struggle, much bloodshed would have been prevented. Black Hawk was chief now of the Sac and Fox nations, and a noted warrior. He and his tribe inhabited a village on Rock River, nearly three miles above its confluence with the Mississippi, where the tribe had lived many generations. When that portion of Illinois was reserved to them, they remained in peaceable possession of their reservation, spending their time in the enjoyment of Indian life. The fine situation of their village and the quality of their lands incited the more lawless white settlers, who from time to time began to encroach upon the red men's domain. From one pretext to another, and from one step to another, the crafty white men gained a foothold, until through whisky and artifice they obtained deeds from many of the Indians for their possessions. The Indians were finally induced to cross over the Father of Waters and locate among the Iowas. Black Hawk was strenuously opposed to all this, but as the authorities of Illinois and the United States thought this the best move, he was forced to comply. Moreover other tribes joined the whites and urged the removal. Black Hawk would not agree to the terms of the treaty made with his nation for their lands, and as soon as the military, called to enforce his removal, had retired, he returned to the Illinois side of the river. A large force was at once raised and marched against him. On the evening of May 14, 1832, the first engagement occurred between a band from this army and Black Hawk's band, in which the former were defeated. This attack and its result aroused the whites. A large force of men was raised, and Gen. Scott hastened from the seaboard, by way of the lakes, with United States troops and artillery to aid in the subjugation of the Indians. On the 24th of June, Black Hawk, with 200 warriors, was repulsed by Major Demons between Rock River and Galena. The Ameri can army continued to move up Rock River toward the main body of the Indians, and on the 21st of July came upon Black Hawk and his band, and defeated them near the Blue Mounds. Before this action, Gen. Henry, in command, sent word to the main army by whom he was immediately rejoined, and the whole crossed the Note.\u2014 The above is the generally accepted version of the cause of the Black Hawk War, but in our History of Jo Davies-s County. 111., we had occaskn to po to the bottom of this matter, and have, we think, found the actual cause of the war, whicli will be found on page 157."], [76, "78 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. Wisconsin in pursuit of Black Hawk and his band who were fleeing to the Mississippi. They were overtaken on the 2d of August, and in the battle which followed the power of the Indian chief was completely broken. He fled, but was seized by the Winnebagoes and delivered to the whites. On the 21st of September, 1832, Gen. Scott and Gov. Reynolds con cluded a treaty with the Winnebagoes, Sacs and Foxes by which they ceded to the United States a vast tract of country, and agreed to remain peaceable with the whites. For the faithful performance of the provi sions of this treaty on the part of the Indians, it was stipulated that Black Hawk, his two sons, the prophet Wabokieshiek, and six other chiefs of the hostile bands should be retained as hostages during the pleasure of the President. They were confined at Fort Barracks and put in irons. The next Spring, by order of the Secretary of War, they were taken to Washington. From there they were removed to Fortress Monroe, \"there to remain until the conduct of their nation was such as to justify their being set at liberty.\" They were retained here until the 4th of June, when the authorities directed them to be taken to the principal cities so that they might see the folly of contending against the white people. Everywhere they were observed by thousands, the name of the old chief being extensively known. Byr the middle of August they reached Fort Armstrong on Rock Island, where Black Hawk was soon after released to go to his countrymen. As he passed the site of his birth place, now the home of the white man, he was deeply moved. His village where he was bom, where he had so happily lived, and where he had hoped to die, was now another's dwelling place, and he was a wanderer. On the next day after his release, he went at once to his tribe and his lodge, His wife was }'et living, and with her he passed the remainder of his days. To bis credit it may be said that Black Hawk always re mained true to his wife, and served her with a devotion uncommon among the Indians, living with her upward of forty years. Black Hawk now passed his time hunting and fishing. A deep mel ancholy had settled over him from which he could not be freed. At all times when he visited the whites he was received with marked atten tion. He was an honored guest at the old settlers' reunion in Lee County, Illinois, at some of their meetings, and received many tokens of esteem. In September, 1838, while on his way to Rock Island to receive his annuity from the Government, he contracted a severe cold which resulted in a fatal attack of bilious fever which terminated his life on October 3. His faithful wife, who was devotedly attached to him, mourned deeply during his sickness. After his death he was dressed in the uniform pre sented to him by the President while in Washington. He was buried in a grave six feet in depth, situated upon a beautiful eminence. \" The"], [77, "79 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. body was placed in the middle of the grave, in a sitting posture, upon a seat constructed for the purpose. On his left side, the cane, given him by Henry Clay, was placed upright, with his right hand resting upon it. Many of the old warrior's trophies were placed in the grave, and some Indian garments, together with his favorite weapons.\" No sooner was the Black Hawk war concluded than settlers began rapidly to pour into the northern parts of Illinois, and into Wisconsin, now free from Indian depredations. Chicago, from a trading post, had grown to a commercial center, and was rapidly coming into prominence. In 1835, the formation of a State Government in Michigan was discussed, but did not take active form until two years later, when the State became a part of the Federal Union. The main attraction to that portion of the Northwest lying west of Lake Michigan, now included in the State of Wisconsin, was its alluvial wealth. Copper ore was found about Lake Superior. For some time this region was attached to Michigan for judiciaiy purposes, but in 1830 was made a territory, then including Minnesota and Iowa. The latter State was detached two years later. In 1848, Wisconsin was admitted as a State, Madison being made the capital. We have now traced the various divisions of the Northwest Territory (save a little in Minnesota) from the time it was a unit comprising this vast territory, until circumstances compelled its present division. OTHER INDIAN TROUBLES. Before leaving this part of the narrative, we will narrate briefly the Indian troubles in Minnesota and elsewhere by the Sioux Indians. In August, 1862, the Sioux Indians living on the western borders of Minnesota fell upon the unsuspecting settlers, and in a few hours mas sacred ten or twelve hundred persons. A distressful panic was the immediate result, fully thirty thousand persons fleeing from their homes to districts supposed to be better protected. The military authorities at once took active measures to punish the savages, and a large number were killed and captured. About a year after, Little Crow, the chief, was killed by a Mr. Lampson near Scattered Lake. Of those captured, thirty were hung at Mankato, and the remainder, through fears of mob violence, were removed to Camp McClellan, on the outskirts of the City of Davenport. It was here that Big Eagle came into prominence and secured his release by the following order :"], [78, "80 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. BIG EAGLE."], [79, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 81 \"Special Order, No. 430. \"War Department, \" Adjutant General's Office, Washington, Dec. 3, 1864. \" Big Eagle, an Indian now in confinement at Davenport, Iowa, will, upon the receipt of this order, be immediately released from confine ment and set at liberty. \" By order of the President of the United States. \" Official : \" E. D. Townsend, Ass't Adft Gen. \" Capt. James Vanderventer, Com'y Sub. Vols. \"Through Com'g Gen'l, Washington, D. C.\" Another Indian who figures more prominently than Big Eagle, and who was more cowardly in his nature, with his band of Modoc Indians, is noted in the annals of the New Northwest : we refer to Captain Jack. This distinguished Indian, noted for his cowardly murder of Gen. Canby, was a chief of a Modoc tribe of Indians inhabiting the border lands between California and Oregon. This region of country comprises what is known as the \" Lava Beds,\" a tract of land described as utterly impene trable, save by those savages who had made it their home. The Modocs are known as an exceedingly fierce and treacherous race. They had, according to their own traditions, resided here for many generations, and at one time were exceedingly numerous and powerful. A famine carried off nearly half their numbers, and disease, indolence and the vices of the white man have reduced them to a poor, weak and insignificant tribe. Soon after the settlement of California and Oregon, complaints began to be heard of massacres of emigrant trains passing through the Modoc country. In 1847, an emigrant train, comprising eighteen souls, was en tirely destroyed at a place since known as \" Bloody Point.\" These occur rences caused the United States Government to appoint a peace commission, who, after repeated attempts, in 1864, made a treaty with the Modocs, Snakes and Klamaths, in which it was agreed on their part to remove to a reservation set apart for them in the southern part of Oregon. With the exception of Captain Jack and a band of his followers, who remained at Clear Lake, about six miles from Klamath, all the Indians complied. The Modocs who went to the reservation were under chief Schonchin. Captain Jack remained at the lake without disturbance until 1869, when he was also induced to remove to the reservation. The Modocs and the Klamaths soon became involved in a quarrel, and Captain Jack and his band returned to the Lava Beds. Several attempts were made by the Indian Commissioners to induce them to return to the reservation, and finally becoming involved in a"], [80, "82 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. difficulty with the commissioner and his military escort, a fight ensued, in which the chief and his band were routed. They were greatly enraged, and on their retreat, before the day closed, killed eleven inoffensive whites. The nation was aroused and immediate action demanded. A com mission was at once appointed by the Government to see what could be done. It comprised the following persons : Gen. E. R. S. Canby, Rev. Dr. E. Thomas, a leading Methodist divine of California ; Mr. A. B. Meacham, Judge Rosborough, of California, and a Mr. Dyer, of Oregon. After several interviews, in which the savages were always aggressive, often appearing with scalps in their belts, Bogus Charley came to the commission on the evening of April 10, 1873, and informed them that Capt. Jack and his band would have a \" talk \" to-morrow at a place near Clear Lake, about three miles distant. Here the Commissioners, accom panied by Charley, Riddle, the interpreter, and Boston Charley repaired. After the usual greeting the council proceedings commenced. On behalf of the Indians there were present : Capt. Jack, Black Jim, Schnac Nasty Jim, Ellen's Man, and Hooker Jim. They had no guns, but carried pis tols. After short speeches by Mr. Meacham, Gen. Canby and Dr. Thomas, Chief Schonchin arose to speak. He had scarcely proceeded when, as if by a preconcerted arrangement, Capt. Jack drew his pistol and shot Gen. Canby dead. In less than a minute a dozen shots were fired bj- the savages, and the massacre completed. Mr. Meacham was shot by Schon chin, and Dr. Thomas by Boston Charleyr. Mr. Dyer barely escaped, being fired at twice. Riddle, the interpreter, and his squaw escaped. The troops rushed to the spot where they found Gen. Canby and Dr. Thomas dead, and Mr. Meacham badly wounded. The savages had escaped to their impenetrable fastnesses and could not be pursued. The whole country was aroused by this brutal massacre ; but it was not until the following May that the murderers were brought to justice. At that time Boston Charley gave himself up, and offered to guide the troops to Capt. Jack's stronghold. This led to the capture of his entire gang, a number of whom were murdered by Oregon volunteers while on their way to trial. The remaining Indians were held as prisoners until July when their trial occurred, which led to the conviction of Capt. Jack, Schonchin, Boston Charley, Hooker Jim, Broncho, alias One-Eyed Jim, and Slotuck, who were sentenced to be hanged. These sentences were approved by the President, save in the case of Slotuck and Broncho whose sentences were commuted to imprisonment for life. The others were executed at Fort Klamath, October 3, 1873. These closed the Indian troubles for a time in the Northwest, and for several years the borders of civilization remained in peace. They were again involved in a conflict with the savages about the countrj' of the"], [81, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 83 CAPTAIN JACK, THE MODOC CHIEFTAIN."], [82, "84 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. Black Hills, in which war the gallant Gen. Custer lost his life. Just now the borders of Oregon and California are again in fear of hostilities ; but as the Government has learned how to deal with the Indians, they will be of short duration. The red man is fast passing away before the march of the white man, and a few more generations will read of the Indians as one of the nations of the past. The Northwest abounds in memorable places. We have generally noticed them in the narrative, but our space forbids their description in detail, save of the most important places. Detroit, Cincinnati, Vincennes, Kaskaskia and their kindred towns have all been described. But ere we leave the narrative we will present our readers with an account of the Kinzie house, the old landmark of Chicago, and the discovery of the source of the Mississippi River, each of which may well find a place in the annals of the Northwest. Mr. John Kinzie, of the Kinzie house, represented in the illustra tion, established a trading house at Fort Dearborn in 1804. The stockade had been erected the year previous, and named Fort Dearborn in honor of the Secretary of War. It had a block house at each of the two angles, on the southern side a sallyport, a covered way on the north side, that led down to the river, for the double purpose of providing means of escape, and of procuring water in the event of a siege. Fort Dearborn stood on the south bank of the Chicago River, about half a mile from its mouth. When Major Whistler built it, his soldiers hauled all the timber, for he had no oxen, and so economically did he work that the fort cost the Government only fifty dollars. For a while the garrison could get no grain, and Whistler and his men subsisted on acorns. Now Chicago is the greatest grain center in the world. Mr. Kinzie bought the hut of the first settler, Jean Baptiste Point au Sable, on the site of which he erected his mansion. Within an inclosure in front he planted some Lombardy poplars, seen in the engraving, and in the rear he soon had a fine garden and growing orchard. In 1812 the Kinzie house and its surroundings became the theater of stirring events. The garrison of Fort Dearborn consisted of fifty-four men, under the charge of Capt. Nathan Heald, assisted by Lieutenant Lenai T. Helm (son-in-law to Mrs. Kinzie), and Ensign Ronan. The surgeon was Dr. Voorhees. The only residents at the post at that time were the wives of Capt. Heald and Lieutenant Helm and a few of the soldiers, Mr. Kinzie and his family, and a few Canadian voyagers with their wives and children. The soldiers and Mr. Kinzie were on the most friendly terms with the Pottawatomies and the Winnebagoes, the prin cipal tribes around them, but they could not win them from their attach ment to the British."], [83, "85 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. After the battle of Tippecanoe it was observed that some of the lead ing chiefs became sullen, for some of their people had perished in that conflict with American troops. One evening in April, 1812, Mr. Kinzie sat playing his violin and his children were dancing to the music, when Mrs. Kinzie came rushing into the house pale with terror, and exclaiming, \" The Indians ! the Indians ! \" \" What? Where ? \" eagerly inquired Mr. Kinzie. \" Up at Lee's, killing and scalping,\" answered the frightened mother, who, when the alarm was given, was attending Mrs. Burns, a newly-made mother, living not far off. KINZIE HOUSE. Mr. Kinzie and his family crossed the river in boats, and took refuge in the fort, to which place Mrs. Burns and her infant, not a day old, were conveyed in safety to the shelter of the guns of Fort Dearborn, and the rest of the white inhabitants fled. The Indians were a scalping party of Winnebagoes, who hovered around the fort some days, when they dis appeared, and for several weeks the inhabitants were not disturbed by alarms. Chicago was then so deep in the wilderness, that the news of the declaration of war against Great Britain, made on the 19th of June, 1812, did not reach the commander of the garrison at Fort Dearborn till the 7th of August. Now the fast mail train will carry a man from New York to Chicago in twenty-seven hours, and such a declaration might be sent, every word, by the telegraph in less than the same number of minutes."], [84, "86 THE NOETHWEST TERRITORY. PRESENT CONDITION OF THE NORTHWEST. Preceding chapters have brought us to the close of the Black Hawk war, and we now turn to the contemplation of the growth and prosperity of the Northwest under the smile of peace and the blessings of our civili zation. The pioneers of this region date events back to the deep snow A REPRESENTATIVE PIONEER. of 1831, no one arriving here since that date taking first honors. The inciting cause of the immigration which overflowed the prairies early in the '30s was the reports of the marvelous beauty and fertility of the region distributed through the East by those who had participated in the Black Hawk campaign with Gen. Scott. Chicago and Milwaukee then had a few hundred inhabitants, and Gurdon S. Hubbard's trail from the former city to Kaskaskia led almost through a wilderness. Vegetables and clothing were largely distributed through the regions adjoining the"], [85, "87 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. lakes by steamers from the Ohio towns. There are men now living in Illinois who came to the state when barely an acre was in cultivation, and a man now prominent in the business circles of Chicago looked over the swampy, cheerless site of that metropolis in 1818 and went south ward into civilization. Emigrants from Pennsylvania in 1830 left behind LINCOLN MONUMENT, SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS. them but one small railway in the coal regions, thirty miles in length, and made their way to the Northwest mostly with ox teams, finding in Northern Illinois petty settlements scores of miles apart, although the southern portion of the state was fairly dotted with farms. The water courses of the lakes and rivers furnished transportation to the second great army of immigrants, and about 1850 railroads were pushed to that extent that the crisis of 1837 was precipitated upon us,"], [86, "88 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. from the effects of which the Western country had not fully recovered at the outbreak of the war. Hostilities found the colonists of the prairies fully alive to the demands of the occasion, and the honor of recruiting the vast armies of the Union fell largely to the Governors of the Western States. The struggle, on the whole, had a marked effect for the better on the new Northwest, giving it an impetus which twenty years of peace would not have produced. In a large degree, this prosperity was an inflated one ; and, with the rest of the Union, we have since been compelled to atone therefor by four"], [87, "89 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. years of depression of values, of scarcity of employment, and loss of fortune. To a less degree, however, than the manufacturing or mining regions has the West suffered during the prolonged panic now so near its end. Agriculture, still the leading feature in our industries, has been quite prosperous through all these dark years, and the farmers have cleared away many incumbrances resting over them from the period of fictitious values. The population has steadily increased, the arts and sciences are gaining a stronger foothold, the trade area of the region is becoming daily more extended, and we have been largely exempt from the financial calamities which have nearly wrecked communities on the seaboard dependent wholly on foreign commerce or domestic manufacture. At the present period there are no great schemes broached for the Northwest, no propositions for government subsidies or national works of improvement, but the capital of the world is attracted hither for the purchase of our products or the expansion of our capacity for serving the nation at large. A new era is dawning as to transportation, and we bid fair to deal almost exclusively with the increasing and expanding lines of steel rail running through every few miles of territory on the prairies. The lake marine will no doubt continue to be useful in the warmer season, and to serve as a regulator of freight rates; but experienced navigators forecast the decay of the system in moving to the seaboard the enormous crops of the West. Within the past five years it has become quite common to see direct shipments to Europe and the West Indies going through from the second-class towns along the Mississippi and Missouri. As to popular education, the standard has of late risen very greatly, and our schools would be creditable to any section of the Union. More and more as the events of the war pass into obscurity will the fate of the Northwest be linked with that of the Southwest, and the next Congressional apportionment will give the valley of the Mississippi absolute control of the legislation of the nation, and do much toward securing the removal of the Federal capitol to some more central location. Our public men continue to wield the full share of influence pertain ing to their rank in the national autonomy, and seem not to forget that for the past sixteen years they and their constituents have dictated the principles which should govern the country. In a work like this, destined to lie on the shelves of the library for generations, and not doomed to daily destruction like a newspaper, one can not indulge in the same glowing predictions, the sanguine statements of actualities that fill the columns of ephemeral publications. Time may bring grief to the pet projects of a writer, and explode castles erected on a pedestal of facts. Yet there are unmistakable indications before us of"], [88, "90 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. the same radical change in our great Northwest which characterizes its history for the past thirty years. Our domain has a sort of natural geographical border, save where it melts away to the southward in the cattle raising districts of the southwest. Our prime interest will for some years doubtless be the growth of the food of the world, in which branch it has already outstripped all competitors, and our great rival in this duty will naturally be the fertile plains of Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado, to say nothing of the new empire so rapidly growing up in Texas. Over these regions there is a continued progress in agriculture and in railway building, and we must look to our laurels. Intelligent observers of events are fully aware of the strides made in the way of shipments of fresh meats to Europe, many of these ocean cargoes being actually slaughtered in the West and transported on ice to the wharves of the seaboard cities. That this new enterprise will continue there is no reason to doubt. There are in Chicago several factories for the canning of prepared meats for European consumption, and the orders for this class of goods are already immense. English capital is becoming daily more and more dissatisfied with railway loans and investments, and is gradually seeking mammoth outlays in lands and live stock. The stock yards in Chicago, Indianapolis and East St. Louis are yearly increasing their facilities, and their plant steadily grows more valuable. Importations of blooded animals from the pro gressive countries of Europe are destined to greatly improve the quality of our beef and mutton. Nowhere is there to be seen a more enticing display in this line than at our state and county fairs, and the interest in the matter is on the increase. To attempt to give statistics of our grain production for 1877 would be useless, so far have we surpassed ourselves in the quantity and quality of our product. We are too liable, to forget that we are giving the world its first article of necessity \u2014 its food supply. An opportunity to learn this fact so it never can be forgotten was afforded at Chicago at the outbreak of the great panic of 1873, when Canadian purchasers, fearing the prostration of business might bring about an anarchical condition of affairs, went to that city with coin in bulk and foreign drafts to secure their supplies in their own currency at first hands. It may be justly claimed b)r the agricultural community that their combined efforts gave the nation its first impetus toward a restoration of its crippled industries, and their labor brought the gold premium to a lower depth than the government was able to reach by its most intense efforts of legislation and compulsion. The hundreds of millions about to be disbursed for farm products have already, by the anticipation common to all commercial"], [89, "THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 91 nations, set the wheels in motion, and will relieve us from the perils so long shadowing our efforts to return to a healthy tone. Manufacturing has attained in the chief cities a foothold which bids fair to render the Northwest independent of the outside world. Nearly our whole region has a distribution of coal measures which will in time support the manufactures necessary to our comfort and prosperity. As to transportation, the chief factor in the production of all articles except food, no section is so magnificently endowed, and our facilities are yearly increasing beyond those of any other region."], [90, "92 THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. The period from a central point of the war to the outbreak of the panic was marked by a tremendous growth in our railway lines, but the depression of the times caused almost a total suspension of operations. Now that prosperity is returning to our stricken country we witness its anticipation by the railroad interest in a series of projects, extensions, and leases which bid fair to largely increase our transportation facilities. The process of foreclosure and sale of incumbered lines is another matter to be considered. In the case of the Illinois Central road, which formerly transferred to other lines at Cairo the vast burden of freight destined for the Gulf region, we now see the incorporation of the tracks connecting through to New Orleans, every mile co-operating in turning toward the northwestern metropolis the weight of the inter-state commerce of a thousand miles or more of fertile plantations. Three competing routes to Texas have established in Chicago their general freight and passenger agencies. Four or five lines compete for all Pacific freights to a point as as far as the interior of Nebraska. Half a dozen or more splendid bridge structures have been thrown across the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers by the railways. The Chicago and Northwestern line has become an aggre gation of over two thousand miles of rail, and the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul is its close rival in extent and importance. The three lines running to Cairo via Vincennes form a through route for all traffic with the states to the southward. The chief projects now under discussion are the Chicago and Atlantic, which is to unite with lines now built to Charleston, and the Chicago and Canada Southern, which line will con nect with all the various branches of that Canadian enterprise. Our latest new road is the Chicago and Lake Huron, formed of three lines, and entering the city from Valparaiso on the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago track. The trunk lines being mainly in operation, the progress made in the way of shortening tracks, making air-line branches, and running extensions does not show to the advantage it deserves, as this process is constantly adding new facilities to the established order of things. The panic reduced the price of steel to a point where the railways could hardly afford to use iron rails, and all our northwestern lines report large relays of Bessemer track. The immense crops now being moved have given a great rise to the value of railway stocks, and their transportation must result in heavy pecuniary advantages. Few are aware of the importance of the wholesale and jobbing trade of Chicago. One leading firm has since the panic sold $24,000,000 of dry goods in one year, and they now expect most confidently to add seventy per cent, to the figures of their last year's business.

Accumulating here throughout the spring and summer months, they are summoned home at pleasure to move the products of the prairies. This process greatly strengthens the northwest in its financial operations, leaving home capital to supplement local operations on behalf of home interests.

It is impossible in our brief space to give more than a meager sketch of such a city as Chicago, which is in itself the greatest marvel of the Prairie State.

Some impression of her importance is received from the shock her burning gave to the civilized world . When the doubt of her calamity was removed, and the horrid fact was accepted, there went a shudder over all cities, and a quiver over all lands. There was scarcely a town in the civilized world that did not shake on the brink of this opening chasm. The flames of our homes red dened all skies. The city was set upon a hill, and could not be hid. All eyes were turned upon it. To have struggled and suffered amid the scenes of its fall is as distinguishing as to have fought at Thermopyl\u00e6, or Salamis, or Hastings, or Waterloo, or Bunker Hill. Its calamity amazed the world, because it was felt to be the common property of mankind. The early history of the city is full of interest, just as the early his tory of such a man as Washington or Lincoln becomes public property, and is cherished by every patriot. Starting with 560 acres in 1833, it embraced and occupied 23,000 acres in 1869, and, having now a population of more than 500,000, it com mands general attention. The first settler \u2014 Jean Baptiste Pointe au Sable, a mulatto from the West Indies \u2014 came and began trade with the Indians in 1796. John Kinzie became his successor in 1804, in which year Fort Dearborn was erected. A mere trading-post was kept here from that tim6 till about the time of the Blackhawk war, in 1832. It was not the city. It was merely a cock crowing at midnight. The morning was not yet. In 1833 the set tlement about the fort was incorporated as a town. The voters were divided on the propriety of such corporation, twelve voting for it and one against it. Four years later it was incorporated as a city, and embraced 560 acres. The produce handled in this city is an indication of its power. Grain and flour were imported from the East till as late as 1837. The first exportation by way of experiment was in 1839. Exports exceeded imports first in 1842. The Board of Trade was organized in 1848, but it was so weak that it needed nursing till 1855. Grain was purchased by the wagon-load in the street. I remember sitting with my father on a load of wheat, in the long"], [95, "HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. 97 line of wagons along Lake street, while the buyers came and untied the bags, and examined the grain, and made their bids. That manner of business had to cease with the day of small things. Now our elevators will hold 15,000,000 bushels of grain. The cash value of the produce handled in a year is 1215,000,000, and the produce weighs 7,000,000 tons or 700,000 car loads. This handles thirteen and a half ton each minute, all the year round. One tenth of all the wheat in the United States is handled in Chicago. Even as long ago as 1853 the receipts of grain in Chicago exceeded those of the goodly city of St. Louis, and in 1854 the exports of grain from Chicago exceeded those of New York and doubled those of St. Petersburg, Archangel, or Odessa, the largest grain markets in Europe. The manufacturing interests of the city are not contemptible. In 1873 manufactories employed 45,000 operatives ; in 1876, 60,000. The manufactured product in 1875 was worth $177,000,000. No estimate of the size and power of Chicago would be adequate that did not put large emphasis on the railroads. Before they came thundering along our streets canals were the hope of our country. But jvho ever thinks now of traveling by canal packets ? In June, 1852, there were only forty miles of railroad connected with the city. The old Galena division of the Northwestern ran out to Elgin. But now, who can count the trains and measure the roads that seek a terminus or connection in this city ? The lake stretches away to the north, gathering in to this center all the harvests that might otherwise pass to the north of us. If you will take a map and look at the adjustment of railroads, you will see, first, that Chicago is the great railroad center of the world, as New York is the commercial city of this continent ; and, second, that the railroad lines form the iron spokes of a great wheel whose hub is this city. The lake furnishes the only break in the spokes, and this seems simply to have pushed a few spokes together on each shore. See the eighteen trunk lines, exclusive of eastern connections. Pass round the circle, and view their numbers and extent. There is the great Northwestern, with all its branches, one branch creeping along the lake shore, and so reaching to the north, into the Lake Superior regions, away to the right, and on to the Northern Pacific on the left, swinging around Green Bay for iron and copper and silver, twelve months in the year, and reaching out for the wealth of the great agricultural belt and isothermal line traversed by the Northern Pacific. Another branch, not so far north, feeling for the heart of the Badger State. Another pushing lower down the Mississippi \u2014 all these make many con nections, and tapping all the vast wheat regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and all the regions this side of sunset. There is that elegant road, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, running out a goodly number of"], [96, "98 HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. OLD FORT DEARBORN, 1830. PEESENT SITE OF LAliE STREET BRIDGE, CHICAGO, IN 1S33."], [97, "HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. 99 branches, and reaping the great fields this side of the Missouri River. I can only mention the Chicago, Alton & St. Louis, our Illinois Central, described elsewhere, and the Chicago & Rock Island. Further around we come to the lines connecting us with all the eastern cities. The Chicago, Indianapolis & St. Louis, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago, the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern, and the Michigan Cen tral and Great Western, give us many highways to the seaboard. Thus we reach the Mississippi at five points, from St. Paul to Cairo and the Gulf itself by two routes. We also reach Cincinnati and Baltimore, and Pitts burgh and Philadelphia, and New York. North and south run the water courses of the lakes and the rivers, broken just enough at this point to make a pass. Through this, from east to west, run the long lines that stretch from ocean to ocean. This is the neck of the glass, and the golden sands of commerce must pass into our hands. Altogether we have more than 10,000 miles of railroad, directly tributary to this city, seeking to unload their wealth in our coffers. All these roads have come themselves by the infallible instinct of capital. Not a dollar was ever given by the city to secure one of them, and only a small per cent, of stock taken originally by her citizens, and that taken simply as an investment. Coming in the natural order of events, they will not be easily diverted, There is still another showing to ail this. The connection between New York and San Francisco is by the middle route. This passes inevit ably through Chicago. St. Louis wants the Southern Pacific or Kansas Pacific, and pushes it out through Denver, and so on up to Cheyenne. But before the road is fairly under way, the Chicago roads shove out to Kansas City, making even the Kansas Pacific a feeder, and actually leav ing St. Louis out in the cold. It is not too much to expect that Dakota, Montana, and Washington Territory will find their great market in Chi cago. But these are not all. Perhaps I had better notice here the ten or fifteen new roads that have just entered, or are just entering, our city. Their names are all that is necessary to give. Chicago & St. Paul, look ing up the Red River country to the British possessions ; the Chicago, Atlantic & Pacific ; the Chicago, Decatur & State Line ; the Baltimore & Ohio; the Chicago, Danville & Vincennes; the Chicago & LaSalle Rail road ; the Chicago, Pittsburgh & Cincinnati : the Chicago and Canada Southern ; the Chicago and Illinois River Railroad. These, with their connections, and with the new connections of the old roads, already in process of erection, give to Chicago not less than 10,000 miles of new tributaries from the richest land on the continent. Thus there will be added to the reserve power, to the capital within reach of this city, not less than 11,000,000,000."], [98, "HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. 100 Add to all this transporting power the ships that sail one every nine minutes of the business hours of the season of navigation ; add, also, the canal boats that leave one every five minutes during the same time \u2014 and you will see something of the business of the city. THE COMMERCE OF THIS CITY has been leaping along to keep pace with the growth of the country around us. In 1852, our commerce reached the hopeful sum of $20,000,000. In 1870 it reached $400,000,000. In 1871 it was pushed up above $450,000,000. And in 1875 it touched nearly double that. One-half of our imported goods come directly to Chicago. Grain enough is exported directly from our docks to the old world to employ a semi-weekly line of steamers of 3,000 tons capacity. This branch is not likely to be greatly developed. Even after the great Welland Canal is completed we shall have only fourteen feet of water. The great ocean vessels will continue to control the trade. The banking capital of Chicago is $24,431,000. Total exchange in 1875, $659,000,000. Her wholesale business in 1875 was $294,000,000. The rate of taxes is less than in any other great city. The schools of Chicago are unsurpassed in America. Out of a popu lation of 300,000 there were only 186 persons between the ages of six and twenty-one unable to read. This is the best known record. In 1831 the mail system was condensed into a half-breed, who went on foot to Niles, Mich., once in two weeks, and brought back what papers and news he could find. As late as 1846 there was often only one mail a week. A post-office was established in Chicago in 1833, and the post master nailed, up old boot-legs on one side of his shop to serve as boxes for the nabobs and literary men. It is an interesting fact in the growth of the young city that in the active life of the business men of that day the mail matter has grown to a daily average of over 6,500 pounds. It speaks equally well for the intelligence of the people and the commercial importance of the place, that the mail matter distributed to the territory immediately tributary to Chicago is seven times greater than that distributed to the territory immediately tributary to St. Louis. The improvements that have characterized the city are as startling as the city itself. In 1831, Mark Beaubien established a ferry over the river, and put himself under bonds to carry all the citizens free for the privilege of charging strangers. Now there are twenty-four large bridges and two tunnels. In 1833 the government expended $30,000 on the harbor. Then commenced that series of man\u0153uvers with the river that has made it one"], [99, "101 HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. of the world's curiosities. It used to wind around in the lower end of the town, and make its way rippling over the sand into the lake at the foot of Madison street. They took it up and put it down where it now is. It was a narrow stream, so narrow that even moderately small crafts had to go up through the willows and cat's tails to the point near Lake street bridge, and back up one of the branches to get room enough in which to turn around. In 1844 the quagmires in the streets were first pontooned by plank roads, which acted in wet weather as public squirt-guns. Keeping you out of the mud, they compromised by squirting the mud over you. The wooden-block pavements came to Chicago in 1857. In 1840 water was delivered by peddlers in carts or by hand. Then a twenty-five horse power engine pushed it through hollow or bored logs along the streets till 1854, when it was introduced into the houses by new works. The first fire-engine was used in 1835, and the first steam fire-engine in 1859. Gas was utilized for lighting the city in 1850. The Young Men's Chris tian Association was organized in 1858, and horse railroads carried them to their work in 1859. The museum was opened in 1863. The alarm telegraph adopted in 1864. The opera-house built in 1865. The city grew from 560 acres in 1833 to 23,000 in 1869. In 1834, the taxes amounted to $48.90, and the trustees of the town borrowed $60 more for opening and improving streets. In 1835, the legislature authorized a loan of $2,000, and the treasurer and street commissioners resigned rather than plunge the town into such a gulf. Now the city embraces 36 square miles of territory, and has 30 miles of water front, besides the outside harbor of refuge, of 400 acres, inclosed by a crib sea-wall. One-third of the city has been raised up an average of eight feet, giving good pitch to the 263 miles of sewerage. The water of the city is above all competition. It is received through two tunnels extending to a crib in the lake two miles from shore. The closest analy sis fails to detect any impurities, and, received 35 feet below the surface, it is always clear and cold. The first tunnel is five feet two inches in diameter and two miles long, and can deliver 50,000,000 of gallons per day. The second tunnel is seven feet in diameter and six miles long, running four miles under the city, and can deliver 100,000,000 of gal lons per day. This water is distributed through 410 miles of water mains. The three grand engineering exploits of the city are : First, lifting the city up on jack-screws, whole squares at a time, without interrupting the business, thus giving us good drainage ; second, running the tunnels under the lake, giving us the best water in the world ; and third, the turning the current of the river in its own channel, delivering us from the old abominations, and making decency possible. They redound about"], [100, "102 HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. equally to the credit of the engineering, to the energy of the people, and to the health of the city. That which really constitutes the city, its indescribable spirit, its soul, the way it lights up in every feature in the hour of action, has not been touched. In meeting strangers, one is often surprised how some homely women marry so well. Their forms are bad, their gait uneven and awk ward, their complexion is dull, their features are misshapen and mismatch ed, and when we see them there is no beauty that we should desire them. But when once they are aroused on some subject, they put on new pro portions. They light up into great power. The real person comes out from its unseemly ambush, and captures us at will. They have power. They have ability to cause things to come to pass. We no longer wonder why they are in such high demand. So it is with our city. There is no grand scenery except the two seas, one of water, the other of prairie. Nevertheless, there is a spirit about it, a push, a breadth, a power, that soon makes it a place never to be forsaken. One soon ceases to believe in impossibilities. Balaams are the only prophets that are disappointed. The bottom that has been on the point of falling out has been there so long that it has grown fast. It can not fall out. It has all the capital of the world itching to get inside the corporation. The two great laws that govern the growth and size of cities are, first, the amount of territory for which they are the distributing and receiving points ; second, the number of medium or moderate dealers that do this distributing. Monopolists build up themselves, not the cities. They neither eat, wear, nor live in proportion to their business. Both these laws help Chicago. The tide of trade is eastward \u2014 not up or down the map, but across the map. The lake runs up a wingdam for 500 miles to gather in the business. Commerce can not ferry up there for seven months in the year, and the facilities for seven months can do the work for twelve. Then the great region west of us is nearly all good, productive land. Dropping south into the trail of St. Louis, you fall into vast deserts and rocky dis tricts, useful in holding the world together. St. Louis and Cincinnati, instead of rivaling and hurting Chicago, are her greatest sureties of dominion. They are far enough away to give sea-room, \u2014 farther off than Paris is from London, \u2014 and yet they are near enough to prevent the springing up of any other great city between them. St. Louis will be helped by the opening of the Mississippi, but also hurt. That will put New Orleans on her feet, and with a railroad running over into Texas and so West, she will tap the streams that now crawl up the Texas and Missouri road. The current is East, not North, and a sea port at New Orleans can not permanently help St. Louis. Chicago is in the field almost alone, to handle the wealth of one-"], [101, "103 HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. fourth of the territory of this great republic. This strip of seacoast divides its margins between Portland, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Savannah, or some other great port to be created for the South in the next decade. But Chicago has a dozen empires casting their treasures into her lap. On a bed of coal that can run all the machinery of the world for 500 centuries ; in a garden that can feed the race by the thousand years; at the head of the lakes that give her a temperature as a summer resort equaled by no great city in the land ; with a climate that insures the health of her citizens ; surrounded by all the great deposits of natural wealth in mines and forests and herds, Chicago is the wonder of to-day, and will be the city of the future. MASSACRE AT FORT DEARBORN. During the war of 1812, Fort Dearborn became the theater of stirring events. The garrison consisted of fifty-four men under command of Captain Nathan Heald, assisted by Lieutenant Helm (son-in-law of Mrs. Kinzie) and Ensign Ronan. Dr. Voorhees was surgeon. The only resi dents at the post at that time were the wives of Captain Heald and Lieu tenant Helm, and a few of the soldiers, Mr. Kinzie and his family, and a few Canadian voyageurs, with their wives and children. The soldiers and Mr. Kinzie were on most friendly terms with the Pottawattamies and Winnebagos, the principal tribes around them, but they could not win them from their attachment to the British. One evening in April, 1812, Mr. Kinzie sat playing on his violin and his children were dancing to the music, when Mrs. Kinzie came rushing into the house, pale with terror, and exclaiming: \"The Indians! the Indians!\" \"What? Where?\" eagerly inquired Mr. Kinzie. \"Up at Lee's, killing and scalping,\" answered the frightened mother, who, when the alarm was given, was attending Mrs. Barnes (just confined) living not far off. Mr. Kinzie and his family crossed the river and took refuge in the* fort, to which place Mrs. Barnes and her infant not a day old were safely conveyed. The rest of the inhabitants took shelter in the fort. This alarm was caused by a scalping party of Winnebagos, who hovered about the fort several days, when they disappeared, and for several weeks the inhabitants were undisturbed. On the 7th of August, 1812, General Hull, at Detroit, sent orders to Captain Heald to evacuate Fort Dearborn, and to distribute all the United States property to the Indians in the neighborhood \u2014 a most insane order. The Pottawattamie chief, who brought the dispatch, had more wisdom than the commanding general. He advised Captain Heald not to make the distribution. Said he : \" Leave the fort and stores as they are, and let the Indians make distribution for themselves; and while they are engaged in the business, the white people may escape to Fort Wayne.\""], [102, "RUINS OI' CIIICAUO."], [103, "HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. 105 Captain Heald held a council with the Indians on the afternoon of the 12th, in which his officers refused to join, for they had been informed that treachery was designed \u2014 that the Indians intended to murder the white people in the council, and then destroy those in the fort. Captain Heald, however, took the precaution to open a port-hole displaying a cannon pointing directly upon the council, and by that means saved his life. Mr. Kinzie, who knew the Indians well, begged Captain Heald not to confide in their promises, nor distribute the arms and munitions among them, for it would only put power into their hands to destroy the whites. Acting upon this advice, Heald resolved to withhold the munitions of war ; and on the night of the 13th, after the distribution of the other property had been made, the powder, ball and liquors were thrown into the river, the muskets broken up and destroyed. Black Partridge, a friendly chief, came to Captain Heald, and said : \" Linden birds have been singing in my ears to-day: be careful on the march you are going to take.\" On that dark night vigilant Indians had crept near the fort and discovered the destruction of their promised booty going on within. The next morning the powder was seen floating on the surface of the river. The savages were exasperated and made loud com plaints and threats. On the following day when preparations were making to leave the fort, and all the inmates were deeply impressed with a sense of impend ing danger, Capt. Wells, an uncle of Mrs. Heald, was discovered upon the Indian trail among the sand-hills on the borders of the lake, not far distant, with a band of mounted Miamis, of whose tribe he was chief, having been adopted by the famous Miami warrior, Little Turtle. When news of Hull's surrender reached Fort Wayne, he had started with this force to assist Heald in defending Fort Dearborn. He was too late. Every means for its defense had been destroyed the night before, and arrangements were made for leaving the fort on the morning of the 15th. It was a warm bright morning in the middle of August. Indications Were positive that the savages intended to murder the white people ; and when they moved out of the southern gate of the fort, the march was like a funeral procession. The band, feeling the solemnity of the occa sion, struck up the Dead March in Saul. Capt. Wells, who had blackened his face with gun-powder in token of his fate, took the lead with his band of Miamis, followed by Capt. Heald, with his wife by his side on horseback. Mr. Kinzie hoped by his personal influence to avert the impending blow, and therefore accompanied them, leaving his family in a boat in charge of a friendly Indian, to be taken to his trading station at the site of Niles, Michigan, in the event of his death."], [104, "106 HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST."], [105, "107 HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. The procession moved slowly along the lake shore till they reached the sand-hills between the prairie and the beach, when the'Pottawattamie escort, under the leadership of Blackbird, filed to the right, placing those hills between them and the white people. Wells, with his Miamis, had kept in the advance. They suddenly came rushing back, Wells exclaim ing, \" They are about to attack us % form instantly.\" These words were quickly followed by a storm of bullets, which came whistling over the little hills which the treacherous savages had made the covert for their murderous attack. The white troops charged upon the Indians, drove them back to the prairie, and then the battle was waged between fifty four soldiers, twelve civilians and three or four women (the cowardly Miamis having fled at the outset) against five hundred Indian warriors. The white people, hopeless, resolved to sell their lives as dearly as possible. Ensign Ronan wielded his weapon vigorously, even after falling upon his knees weak from the loss of blood. Capt. Wells, who was by the side of his niece, Mrs. Heald, when the conflict began, behaved with the greatest coolness and courage. He said so her, \" We have not the slightest chance for life. We must part to meet no more in this world. God bless you.\" And then he dashed forward. Seeing a young warrior, painted like a demon, climb into a wagon in which were twelve children, and tomahawk them all, he cried out, unmindful of his personal danger, \" If that is your game, butchering women and children, I will kill too.\" He spurred his horse towards the Indian camp, where they had left their squaws and papooses, hotly pursued by swift-footed young warriors, who sent bullets whistling after him. One of these killed his horse and wounded him severely in the leg. With a yell the young braves rushed to make him their prisoner and reserve him for torture. He resolved not to be made a captive, and by the use of the most provoking epithets tried to induce them to kill him instantly. He called a fiery young chief a squaiv, when the enraged warrior killed Wells instantly with his tomahawk, jumped upon his body, cut out his heart, and ate a portion of the warm morsel with savage delight ! In this fearful combat women bore a conspicuous part. Mrs. Heald was an excellent equestrian and an expert in the use of the rifle. She fought the savages bravely, receiving several severe wounds. Though faint from the loss of blood, she managed to keep her saddle. A savage raised his tomahawk to kill her, when she looked him full in the face, and with a sweet smile and in a gentle voice said, in his own language, \" Surely you will not kill a squaw ! \" The arm of the savage fell, and the life of the heroic woman was saved. Mrs. Helm, the step-daughter of Mr. Kinzie, had an encounter with a stout Indian, who attempted to tomahawk her. Springing to one side, she received the glancing blow on her shoulder, and at the same instant"], [106, "108 HISTORY OF THE NORTHWEST. seized the savage round the neck with her arms and endeavored to get hold of his scalping knife, which hung in a sheath at his breast. While she was thus struggling she was dragged from her antagonist by anc ihei powerful Indian, who bore her, in spite of her struggles, to the margin of the lake and plunged her in. To her astonishment she was held by him so that she would not drown, and she soon perceived that she was in the hands of the friendly Black Partridge, who had saved her life. The wife of Sergeant Holt, a large and powerful woman, behaved as bravely as an Amazon. She rode a fine, high-spirited horse, which the Indians coveted, and several of them attacked her with the butts of their guns, for the purpose of dismounting her ; but she used the sword which she had snatched from her disabled husband so skillfully that she foiled them ; and, suddenly wheeling her horse, she dashed over the prairie, followed by the savages shouting, \" The brave woman ! the brave woman ! Don't hurt her ! '' They finally overtook her, and while she was fighting them in front, a powerful savage came up behind her, seized her by the neck and dragged her to the ground. Horse and woman were made captives. Mrs. Holt was a long time a captive among the Indians, but was afterwards ransomed. In this sharp conflict two-thirds of the white people were slain and wounded, and all their horses, baggage and provision were lost. Only twenty-eight straggling men now remained to fight five hundred Indians rendered furious by the sight of blood. They succeeded in breaking through the ranks of the murderers and gaining a slight eminence on the prairie near the Oak Woods. The Indians did not pursue, but gathered on their flanks, while the chiefs held a consultation on the sand-hills, and showed signs of willingness to parley. It would have been madness on the part of the whites to renew the fight ; and so Capt. Heald went for ward and met Blackbird on the open prairie, where terms of surrender were soon agreed upon. It was arranged that the white people should give up their arms to Blackbird, and that the survivors should become prisoners of war, to be exchanged for ransoms as soon as practicable. With this understanding captives and captors started for the Indian camp near the fort, to which Mrs. Helm had been taken bleeding and suffering by Black Partridge, and had met her step-father and learned that her husband was safe. A new scene of horror was now opened at the Indian camp. The wounded, not being included in the terms of surrender, as it was inter preted by the Indians, and the British general, Proctor, having offered a liberal bounty for American scalps, delivered at Maiden, nearly all the wounded men were killed and scalped, and the price of the trophies was afterwards paid by the British government."], [107, "HE STATE OF IOWA GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. The State of Iowa has an outline figure nearly approaching that of a rec tangular parallelogram, the northern and southern boundaries being nearly due east and west lines, and its eastern and western boundaries determined by southerly flowing rivers \u2014 the Mississippi on the east, and the Missouri, together with its tributary, the Big Sioux, on the west. The northern boundary is upon the parallel of forty-three degrees thirty minutes, and the southern is approxi mately upon that of forty degrees and thirty-six minutes. The distance from the northern to the southern boundary, excluding the small prominent angle at the southeast corner, is a little more than two hundred miles. Owing to the irregularity of the river boundaries, however, the number of square miles does not reach that of the multiple of these numbers ; but according to a report of the Secretary of the Treasury to the United States Senate, March 12, 1863, the State of Iowa contains 35,228,200 acres, or 55,044 square miles. When it is understood that all this vast extent of surface, except that which is occupied by our rivers, lakes and peat beds of the northern counties, is susceptible of the highest cultivation, some idea may be formed of the immense agricultural resources of the State. Iowa is nearly as large as England, and twice as large as Scotland ; but when we consider the relative area of surface which may be made to yield to the wants of man, those countries of the Old World will bear no comparison with Iowa. TOPOGRAPHY. No complete topographical survey of the State of Iowa has yet been made. Therefore all the knowledge we have yet upon the subject has been obtained from incidental observations of geological corps, from barometrical observations by authority of the General Government, and levelings done by railroad en gineer corps within the State. Taking into view the facts that the highest point in the State is but a little more than twelve hundred feet above the lowest point, that these two points are nearly three hundred miles apart, and that the whole State is traversed by 100"], [108, "110 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. gently flowing rivers, it will be seen that in reality the State of Iowa rests wholly within, and comprises a part of, a vast plain, with no mountain or hill ranges within its borders. A clearer idea of the great uniformity of the surface of the State may be obtained from a statement of the general slopes in feet per mile, from point to point, in straight lines across it : From the N. E. corner to the S. E. corner of the State 1 foot 1 inch per mile. From the N. E. corner to Spirit Lake 5 feet 5 inches per mile. From the N. W. corner to Spirit Lake 5 feetO inches per mile. From the N. W. corner to the S. W. corner of the State 2 feet 0 inches per mile. From the S. W. corner to the highest ridge between the two great rivers (in Ringgold County)... 4 feet 1 inch per mile From the dividing ridge in the S. E. corner of the State 5 feet 7 inches per mile. From the highest point in the State (near Spirit Lake) to the lowest point in the State (at the mouth of Des Moines River) 4 feet 0 inches per mile. It will be seen, therefore, that there is a good degree of propriety in regard- ing the whole State as a part of a great plain, the lowest point of which within its borders, the southeast corner of the State, is only 444 feet above the level of the sea. The average height of the whole State above the level of the sea is not far from eight hundred feet, although it is more than a thousand miles inland from the nearest sea coast. These remarks are, of course, to be under stood as applying to the surface of the State as a whole. When we come to consider its surface feature in detail, we find a great diversity of surface by the formation of valleys out of the general level, which have been evolved by the action of streams during the unnumbered years of the terrace epoch. It is in the northeastern part of the State that the river valleys are deepest ; consequently the country there has the greatest diversity of surface, and its physical features are most strongly marked. DRAINAGE SYSTEM. The Mississippi and Missouri Rivers form the eastern and western bounda- ries of the State, and receive the eastern and western drainage of it. The eastern drainage system comprises not far from two-thirds of the en- tire surface of the State. The great watershed which divides these two systems is formed by the highest land between those rivers along the whole length of a line running southward from, a point on the northern boundary line of the State near Spirit Lake, in Dickinson County, to a nearly central point in the northern part of Adair County. From the last named point, this highest ridge of land, between the two \u00b0reat rivers, continues southward, without change of character, through Ringgold County into the State of Missouri ; but southward from that point, in Adair County, it is no longer the great watershed. From that point, another and lower ridge bears off more nearly southeastward, through the counties of Madi- son, Clarke, Lucas and Appanoose, and becomes itself the great watershed."], [109, "111 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. RIVERS. All streams that rise in Iowa rise upon the incoherent surface deposits, occupying at first only slight depressions in the surface, and scarcely percept ible. These successively coalesce to form the streams. The drift and bluff deposits are both so thick in Iowa that its streams not only rise upon their surface, but they also reach considerable depth into these deposits alone, in some cases to a depth of nearly two hundred feet from the general prairie level. The majority of streams that constitute the western system of Iowa drainage run, either along the whole or a part of their course, upon that peculir deposit known as bluff deposit. Their banks are often, even of the small streams, from five to ten feet in height, quite perpendicular, so that they make the streams almost everywhere unfordable, and a great impediment to travel across the open country where there are no bridges. The material of this deposit is of a slightly yellowish ash color, except where darkened by decaying vegetation, very fine and silicious, but not sandy, not very cohesive, and not at all plastic. It forms excellent soil, and does not bake or crack in drying, except limy concretions, which are generally dis tributed throughout the mass^ in shape and size resembling pebbles ; not a stone or pebble can be found in the whole deposit. It was called \" silicious marl \" by Dr. Owen, in his geological report to the General Government, and its origin referred to an accumulation of sediment in an ancient lake, which was afterward drained, when its sediment became dry land. Prof. Swallaw gives it the name of \"bluff,\" which is here adopted ; the term Lacustral would have been better. The peculiar properties of this deposit are that it will stand securely with a precipitous front two hundred feet high, and yet is easily excavated with a spade. Wells dug in it require only to be walled to a point just above the water line. Yet, compact as it is, it is very porous, so that water which falls on its surface does not remain, but percolates through it ; neither does it accumulate within its mass, as it does upon the surface of and within the drift and the stratified formations. The bluff deposit is known to occupy a region through which the Missouri runs almost centrally, and measures, as far as is known, more than two hun dred miles in length and nearly one hundred miles in width. The thickest part yet known in Iowa is in Fremont County, where it reaches two hundred feet. The boundaries of this deposit in Iowa are nearly as follows : Com mencing at the southeast corner of Fremont County, follow up the watershed between the\u00bb East Nishnabotany and the West Tarkio Rivers to the southern boundary of Cass County ; thence to the center of Audubon County ; thence to Tip Top Station, on the Chicago & Northwestern Railway ; thence by a broad curve westward to the northwest corner of Plymouth County. This deposit is composed of fine sedimentary particles, similar to that which the Missouri River now deposits from its waters, and is the same which"], [110, "112 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. that river did deposit in a broad depression in the surface of the drift that formed a lake-like expansion of that river in the earliest period of the history of its valley. That lake, as shown by its deposit, which now remains, was about one hundred miles wide and more than twice as long. The water of the river was muddy then, as now, and the broad lake became filled with the sedi ment which the river brought down, before its valley had enough in the lower portion of its course to drain it. After the lake became filled with the sedi ment, the valley below became deepened by the constant erosive action of the waters, to a depth of more than sufficient to have drained the lake of its first waters ; but the only effect then was to cause it to cut its valley out of the de posits its own muddy waters had formed. Thus along the valley of that river, so far as it forms the western boundary of Iowa, the bluffs which border it are composed of that sediment known as bluff deposit, forming a distinct border along the broad, level flood plain, the width of which varies from five to fifteen miles, while the original sedimentary deposit stretches far inland. All the rivers of the western system of drainage, except the Missouri itself, are quite incomplete as rivers, in consequence of their being really only branches of other larger tributaries of that great river , or, if they empty into the Missouri direct, they have yet all the usual characteristics of Iowa rivers, from their sources to their mouths. Chariton and Grand Rivers both rise and run for the first twenty-five miles of their courses upon the drift deposit alone. The first strata that are exposed by the deepening valleys of both these streams belong to the upper coal meas ures, and they both continue upon the same formation until they make their exit from the State (the former in Appanoose County, the latter in Ringgold County), near the boundary of which they have passed nearly or quite through the whole of that formation to the middle coal measures. Their valleys gradu ally deepen from their upper portions downward, so that within fifteen or twenty miles they have reached a depth of near a hundred and fifty feet below the gen eral level of the adjacent high land. When the rivers have cut their valleys down through the series of limestone strata, they reach those of a clayey com position. Upon these they widen their valleys and make broad flood plains (commonly termed \"bottoms\"), the soil of which is stiff and clayey, except where modified by sandy washings. A considerable breadth of woodland occupies the bottoms and valley sides along a great part of their length ; but their upper branches and tributaries are mostly prairie streams. Platte River. \u2014 This river belongs mainly to Missouri. Its upper branches pass through Ringgold County, and, with the west fork of the Grand River, drain a large region of country. Here the drift deposit reaches its maximum thickness on an east and west line across the State, and the valleys are eroded in some instances to a depth of two hundred feet, apparently, through this deposit alone."], [111, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 113 The term \" drift deposit \" applies to the soil and sub-soil of the greater part of the State, and in it alone many of our wells are dug and our forests take root. It rests upon the stratified rocks. It is composed of clay, sand, gravel aud boulders, promiscuously intermixed, without stratification, varying in char acter in different parts of the State. The proportion of lime in the drift of Iowa is so great that the water of all our wells and springs is too \" hard \" for washing purposes ; and the same sub stance is so prevalent in the drift clays that they are always found to have suffi cient flux when used for the manufacture of brick. One Hundred and Two River is represented in Taylor County, the valleys of which have the same general character of those j ust described. The country around and between the east and west forks of this stream is almost entirely prairie. Nodaivay River. \u2014 This stream is represented by east, middle and west branches. The two former rise in Adair County, the latter in Cass County. These rivers and valleys are fine examples of the small rivers and valleys of Southern Iowa. They have the general character of drift valleys, and with beautiful undulating and sloping sides. The Nodaways drain one of the finest agricultural regions in the State, the soil of which is tillable almost to their very banks. The banks and the adjacent narrow flood plains are almost everywhere composed of a rich, deep, dark loam. Nishnabotany River. \u2014 This river is represented by east and west branches, the former having its source in Anderson County, the latter in Shelby County. Both these branches, from their source to their confluence \u2014 and also the main stream, from thence to the point where it enters the great flood plain of the Missouri \u2014 run through a region the surface of which is occupied by the bluff deposit. The West Nishnabotany is probably without any valuable mill sites. In the western part of Cass County, the East Nishnabotany loses its identity by becoming abruptly divided up into five or six different creeks. A few good mill sites occur here on this stream. None, however, that are thought reliable exist on either of these rivers, or on the main stream below the confluence, except, perhaps, one or two in Montgomery County. The valleys of the two branches, and the intervening upland, possess remarkable fertility. Boyer River. \u2014 Until it enters the flood plain of the Missouri, the Boyer runs almost, if not quite, its entire course through the region occupied bv the bluff deposit, and has cut its valley entirely through it along most of its pas sage. The only rocks exposed are the upper coal measures, near Reed's mill, in Harrison County. The exposures are slight, and are the most northerly now known in Iowa. The valley of this river has usually gently sloping sides, and an ndistinctly defined flood plain. Along the lower half of its course the adjacent upland presents a surface of the billowy character, peculiar to the bluff deposit. The source of this river is in Sac County."], [112, "114 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Soldier River. \u2014 The east and middle branches of this stream have their source in Crawford County, and the west branch in Ida County. The whole course of this river is through the bluff deposit. It has no exposure of strata along its course. Little Sioux River. \u2014 Under this head are included both the main and west branches of that stream, together with the Maple, which is one of its branches. The west branch and the Maple are so similar to the Soldier River that they need no separate description. The main stream- has its boundary near the northern boundary of the State, and runs most of its course upon drift deposit alone, entering the region of the bluff deposit in the southern part of Cherokee County. The two principal upper branches, near their source in Dickinson and Osceola .Counties, are small prairie creeks, with indistinct valleys. On entering Clay County, the valley deepens, and at their confluence has a depth of one hundred feet, which still further increases until along the boundary line between Clay and Buena Vista Counties, it reaches a depth of two hundred feet. Just as the valley enters Cherokee County, it turns to the southward and becomes much widened, with its sides gently sloping to the uplands. When the valley enters the region of the bluff deposit, it assumes the billowy appearance. No exposures of strata of any kind have been found in the valley of the Little Sioux or any of its branches. Floyd River. \u2014 This river rises upon the drift in O'Brien County, and flow ing southward enters the region of the bluff deposit a little north of the center of Plymouth County. Almost from its source to its mouth it is a prairie stream, with slightly sloping valley sides, which blend gradually with the uplands. A single slight exposure of sandstone of cretaceous age occurs in the valley near Sioux City, and which is the only known exposure of rock of any kind along its whole length. Near this exposure is a mill site, but farther up the stream it is not valuable for such purposes. Rock River. \u2014 This stream passes through Lyon and Sioux Counties. It was evidently so named from the fact that considerable exposures of the red Sioux quartzite occur along the main branches of the stream in Minnesota, a few miles north of our State boundary. Within this State the main stream and its branches are drift streams, and strata are exposed. The beds and banks of the streams are usually sandy and gravelly, with occasional boulders intermixed. Big Sioux River. \u2014 The valley of this river, from the northwest corner of the State to its mouth, possesses much the same character as all the streams of the surface deposits. At Sioux Falls, a few miles above the northwest corner of the State, the stream meets with remarkable obstructions from the presence of Sioux quartzite, which outcrops directly across the stream, and causes a fall of about sixty feet within a distance of half a mile, producing a series of cas cades. For the first twenty-five miles above its mouth, the valley is very broad, with a broad, flat flood plain, with gentle slopes occasionally showing indistinctly defined terraces. These terraces and valley bottoms constitute some of the finest"], [113, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 115 agricultural land of the region. On the Iowa side of the valley the upland presents abrupt bluffs, steep as the materials of which they are composed will stand, and from one hundred to nearly two hundred feet high above the stream. At rare intervals, about fifteen miles from its mouth, the cretaceous strata are found exposed in the face of the bluffs of the Iowa side. No other strata are exposed along that part of the valley which borders our State, with the single exception of Sioux quartzite at its extreme northwestern corner. Some good mill sites may be secured along that portion of this river which borders Lyon County, but below this the fall will probably be found insufficient and the location for dams insecure. Missouri River. \u2014 This is one of the muddiest streams on the globe, and its waters are known to be very turbid far toward its source. The chief pecul iarity of this river is its broad flood plains, and its adjacent bluff deposits. Much the greater part of the flood plain of this river is upon the Iowa side, and continuous from the south boundary line of the State to Sioux City, a distance of more than one hundred miles in length, varying from three to five miles in width. This alluvial plain is estimated to contain more than half a million acres of land within the State, upward of four hundred thousand of which are now tillable. The rivers of the eastern system of drainage have quite a different character from those of the western system. They are larger, longer and have their val leys modified to a much greater extent by the underlying strata. For the lat ter reason, water-power is much more abundant upon them than upon the streams of the western system. Des Moines River. \u2014 This river has its source in Minnesota, but it enters Iowa before it has attained any size, and flows almost centrally through it from northwest to southeast, emptying into the Mississippi at the extreme southeast ern corner of the State. It drains a greater area than any river within the State. The upper portion of it is divided into two branches known as the east and west forks. These unite in Humboldt County. The valleys of these branches above their confluence are drift-valleys, except a few small exposures of subcarboniferous limestone about five miles above their confluence. These exposures produce several small mill-sites. The valleys vary from a few hun dred yards to half a mile in width, and are the finest agricultural lands. In the northern part of Webster County, the character of the main valley is modified by the presence of ledges and low cliffs of the subcarboniferous limestone and gypsum. From a point a little below Fort Dodge to near Amsterdam, in Ma rion County, the river runs all the way through and upion the lower coal-meas ure strata. Along this part of its course the flood-plain varies from an eighth to half a mile or more in width. From Amsterdam to Ottumwa the subcarbon iferous limestone appears at intervals in the valley sides. Near Ottumwa, the sub carboniferous rocks pass beneath the liver again, bringing down the coal-measure strata into its bed ; but they rise again from it in the extreme northwestern part"], [114, "116 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. of Van Buren County, and subcarboniferous strata resume and keep their place along the valley to the north of the river. From Fort Dodge to the northern part of Lee County, the strata of the lower coal measures are present in the valley. Its flood plain is frequently sandy, from the debris of the sandstone and sandy shales of the coal measures produced by their removal in the process of the formation of the valley. The principal tributaries of the Des Moines are upon the western side. These are the Raccoon and the three rivers, viz.: South, Middle and North Riv ers. The three latter have their source in the region occupied by the upper coal-measure limestone formation, flow eastward over the middle coal measures, and enter the valley of the Des Moines upon the lower coal measures. These streams, especially South and Middle Rivers, are frequently bordered by high, rocky cliffs. Raccoon River has its source upon the heavy surface deposits of the middle region of Western Iowa, and along the greater part of its course it has excavated its valley out those deposits and the middle coal measures alone. The valley of the Des Moines and its branches are destined to become the seat of extensive manufactures in consequence of the numerous mill sites of immense power, and the fact that the main valley traverses the entire length of the Iowa coal fields. Skunk River. \u2014 This river has its source in Hamilton County, and runs almost its entire course upon the border of the outcrop of the lower coal meas ures, or, more properly speaking, upon the subcarboniferous limestone, just where it begins to pass beneath the coal measures by its southerly and westerly dip. Its general course is southeast. From the western part of Henry County, up as far as Story County, the broad, fiat flood plain is covered with a rich deep clay soil, which, in time of long-continued rains and overflows of the river, has made the valley of Skunk River a terror to travelers from the earliest settle ment of the country. There are some excellent mill sites on the lower half of this river, but they are not so numerous or valuable as on other rivers of the eastern system. Iowa River. \u2014 This river rises in Hancock County, in the midst of a broad, slightly undulating drift region. The first rock exposure is that of subcarbon iferous limestone, in the southwestern corner of Franklin County. It enters the region of the Devonian strata near the southwestern corner of Benton County, and in this it continues to its confluence with the Cedar in Louisa County. Below the junction with the Cedar, and for some miles above that point, its valley is broad, and especially on the northern side, with a well marked flood plain. Its borders gradually blend with the uplands as they slope away in the distance from the river. The Iowa furnishes numerous and valua ble mill sites. Cedar River. \u2014 This stream is usually understood to be a branch of the Iowa, but it ought, really, to be regarded as the main stream. It rises bv numerous branches in the northern part of the State, and flows the entire length"], [115, "117 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. of the State, through the region occupied by the Devonian strata and along the trend occupied by that formation. The valley of this river, in the upper part of its course, is narrow, and the sides slope so gently as to scarcely show where the lowlands end and the up lands begin. Below the confluence with the Shell Rock, the flood plain is more distinctly marked and the valley broad and shallow. The valley of the Cedar is one of the finest regions in the State, and both the main stream and its branches afford abundant and reliable mill sites. Wapsipinnicon River. \u2014 This river has its source near the source of the Cedar, and runs parallel and near it almost its entire course, the upper half upon the same formation \u2014 the Devonian. In the northeastern part of Linn County, it enters the region of the Niagara limestone, upon which it continues to the Mississippi. It is one hundred miles long, and yet the area of its drain age is only from twelve to twenty miles in width. Hence, its numerous mill sites are unusually secure. Turkey River. \u2014 This river and the Upper Iowa are, in many respects, un like other Iowa rivers. The difference is due to the great depth they have eroded their valleys and the different character of the material through which they have eroded. Turkey River rises in Howard County, and in Winnesheik County, a few miles from its source, its valley has attained a depth of more than two hundred feet, and in Fayette and Clayton Counties its depth is increased to three and four hundred feet. The summit of the uplands, bordering nearly the whole length of the valley, is capped by the Maquoketa shales. These shales are underlaid by the Galena limestone, between two and three hundred feet thick. The valley has been eroded through these, and runs upon the Trenton limestone. Thus, all the formations along and within this valley are Lower Silurian. The valley is usually narrow, and without a well-marked flood plain. Water power is abundant, but in most places inaccessible. Upper Iowa River. \u2014 This river rises in Minnesota, just beyond the north ern boundary line, and enters our State in Howard County before it has attained any considerable size. Its course is nearly eastward until it reaches the Mis sissippi. It rises in the region of the Devonian rocks, and flows across the out crops, respectively, of the Niagara, Galena and Trenton limestone, the lower magnesian limestone and Potsdam sandstone, into and through all of which, except the last, it has cut its valley, which is the deepest of any in Iowa. The valley sides are, almost everywhere, high and steep, and cliffs of lower magne sian and Trenton limestone give them a wild and rugged aspect. In the lower part of the valley, the flood plain reaches a width sufficient for the location of small farms, but usually it is too narrow for such purposes. On the higher surface, however, as soon as you leave the valley you come immediately upon a cultivated country. This stream has the greatest slope per mile of any in Iowa, consequently it furnishes immense water power. In some places, where creeks come into it, the valley widens and affords good locations for farms. The town"], [116, "118 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. of Decorah, in Winnesheik County, is located in one of these spots, which makes it a lovely location ; and the power of the river and the small spring streams around it offer fine facilities for manufacturing. This river and its tributaries are the only trout streams in Iowa. Mississippi River. \u2014 This river may be described, in general terms, as a broad canal cut out of the general level of the country through which the river flows. It is bordered by abrupt hills or bluffs. The bottom of the valley ranges from one to eight miles in width. The whole space between the bluffs is occupied by the river and its bottom, or flood plain only, if we except the occasional terraces or remains of ancient flood plains, which are not now reached by the highest floods of the river. The river itself is from half a mile to nearly a mile in width. There are but four points along the whole length of the State where the bluffs approach the stream on both sides. The Lower Silurian formations com pose the bluffs in the northern part of the State, but they gradually disappear by a southerly dip, and the bluffs are continued successively by the Upper Silurian, Devonian, and subcarboniferous rocks, which are reached near the southeastern corner of the State. Considered in their relation to the present general surface of the state, the relative age3 of the river valley of Iowa date back only to the close of the glacial epoch ; but that the Mississippi, and all the rivers of Northeastern Iowa, if no others, had at least a large part of the rocky portions of their valleys eroded by pre-glacial, or perhaps even by pal\u00e6ozoic rivers, can scarcely be doubted. LAKES. The lakes of Iowa may be properly divided into two distinct classes. The first may be called drift lakes, having had their origin in the depressions left in the surface of the drift at the close of the glacial epoch, and have rested upon the undisturbed surface of the drift deposit ever since the glaciers disappeared. The others may be properly termed fluvatile or alluvial lakes, because they have had their origin by the action of rivers while cutting their own valleys out from the surface of the drift as it existed at the close of the glacial epoch, and are now found resting upon the alluvium, as the others rest upon the drift. By the term alluvium is meant the deposit which has accumulated in the valleys of rivers by the action of their own currents. It is largely composed of sand and other coarse material, and upon that deposit are some of the best and most productive soils in the State. It is this deposit which form the flood plains and deltas of our rivers, as well as the terraces of their valleys. The regions to which the drift lakes are principally confined are near the head waters of the principal streams of the State. We consequently find them in those regions which lie between the Cedar and Des Moines Rivers, and the Des Moines and Little Sioux. No drift lakes are found in Southern Iowa. The largest of the lakes to be found in the State are Spirit and Okoboji, in"], [117, "119 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Dickinson County ; Clear Lake, in Cerro Gordo County ; and Storm Lake, in Bunea Vista County. Spirit Lake. \u2014 The width and length of this lake are about equal , and it contains about twelve square miles of surface, its northern border resting directly on the boundary of the State. It lies almost directly upon the great watershed. Its shores are mostly gravelly, and the country about it fertile. Okoboji Lake. \u2014 This body of water lies directly south of Spirit Lake, and has somewhat the shape of a horse-shoe, with its eastern projection within a few rods of Spirit Lake, where it receives the outlet of the latter. Okoboji Lake extends about five miles southward from Spirit Lake, thence about the same distance westward, and then bends northward about as far as the eastern projec tion. The eastern portion i3 narrow, but the western is larger, and in some places a hundred feet deep. The surroundings of this and Spirit Lake are very pleasant. Fish are abundant in them, and they are the resort of myriads of water fowl. Clear Lake. \u2014 This lake is situated in Cerro Gordo County, upon the watershed between the Iowa and Cedar Rivers. It is about five miles long, and two or three miles wide, and has a maximum depth of only fifteen feet. Its shores and the country around it are like that of Spirit Lake. Storm Lake. \u2014 This body of water rests upon the great water shed in Buena Vista County. It is a clear, beautiful sheet of water, containing a surface area of between four and five square miles. The outlets of all these drift-lakes are dr}r during a portion of the year, ex cept Okoboji. Walled Lakes. \u2014 Along the water sheds of Northern Iowa great numbers of small lakes exist, varying from half a mile to a mile in diameter. One of the lakes in Wright County, and another in Sac, have each received the name of \" Walled Lake,\" on account of the existence of embankments on their borders, which are supposed to be the work of ancient inhabitants. These embankments are from two to ten feet in height, and from five to thirty feet across. They are the result of natural causes alone, being referable to the periodic action of ice, aided, to some extent, by the force of the waves. These lakes are very shallow, and in winter freeze to the bottom, so that but little unfrozen wrater remains in the middle. The ice freezes fast to everything upon the bottom, and the expansive power of the water in freezing acts in all directions from the center to the cir cumference, and whatever was on the bottom of the lake has been thus carried to the shore, and this has been going on from year to year, from century to century, forming the embankments which have caused so much wonder. SPRINGS. Springs issue from all formations, and from the sides of almost every valley, but they are more numerous, and assume proportions which give rise to the name of sink-holes, along the upland borders of the Upper Iowa River, owing"], [118, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 120 to the peculiar fissured and laminated character and great thickness of the strata of the age of the Trenton limestone which underlies the whole region of the vallev of that stream. No mineral springs, properly so called, have yet been discovered in Iowa, though the water of several artesian wells is frequently found charged with soluble mineral substances. ORIGIN OF THE PRAIRIES. It is estimated that seven-eighths of the surface of the State was prairie when first settled. They are not confined to level surfaces, nor to any partic ular variety of soil, for within the State they rest upon all formations, from those of the Azoic to those of the Cretaceous age, inclusive. Whatever may have been their origin, their present existence in Iowa is not due to the influ ence of climate, nor the soil, nor any of the underlying formations. Tne real cause is the prevalence of the annual fires. If these had been prevented fifty years ago, Iowa would now be a timbered country. The encroachment of forest trees upon prairie farms as soon as the bordering woodland is protected from the annual prairie fires, is well known to farmers throughout the State. The soil of Iowa is justly famous for its fertility, and there is probably no equal area of the earth's surface that contains so little untillable land, or whose soil has so high an average of fertility. Ninety-five per cent, of its surface is tillable land. GEOLOGY. The soil of Iowa may be separated into three general divisions, which not onlv possess different physical characters, but also differ in the mode of their origin. These are drift, bluff and alluvial, and belong respectively to the deposits bearing the same names. The drift occupies a much larger part of the surface of the State than both the others. The bluff has the next greatest area of surface, and the alluvial least. All soil is disintegrated rock. The drift deposit of Iowa was derived, to a considerable extent, from the rocks of Minnesota ; but the greater part of Iowa drift was derived from its own rocks, much of which has been transported but a short distance. In general terms the constant component element of the drift soil is that portion which was transported from the north, while the inconstant elements are those portions which were derived from the adjacent or underlying strata. For example, in Western Iowa, wherever that cretaceous formation known as the Nishnabotany sandstone exists, the soil contains more sand than elsewhere. The same may be said of the soil of some parts of the State occu pied by the lower coal measures, the sandstones and sandy shales of that forma tion furnishing the sand. In Northern and Northwestern Iowa, the drift contains more sand and gravel than elsewhere. This sand and gravel was, doubtless, derived from the"], [119, "121 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA cretaceous rocks that now do, or formerly did, exist there, and also in part from the conglomerate and pudding-stone beds of the Sioux quartzite. In Southern Iowa, the soil is frequently stiff and clayey. This preponder ating clay is doubtless derived from the clayey and shaly beds which alternate with the limestones of that region. The bluff soil is that which rests upon, and constitutes a part of, the bluff deposit. It is found only in the western part of the State, and adjacent to the Missouri River. Although it contains less than one per cent, of clay in its composition, it is in no respect inferior to the best drift soil. The alluvial soil is that of the flood plains of the river valleys, or bottom lands. That which is periodically flooded by the rivers is of little value for agricultural purposes ; but a large part of it is entirely above the reach of the highest floods, and is very productive. The stratified rocks of Iowa range from the Azoic to the Mesozoic, inclu sive ; but the greater portion of the surface of the State is occupied by those of the Pal\u00e6ozoic age. The table below will show each of these formations in their order : SYSTEMS. GROUPS. FORMATIONS. THICKNESS. AGES. PERIODS. EPOCHS.

The Sioux quartzite is found exposed in natural ledges only upon a few acres in the extreme northwest corner of the State, upon the banks of the Big Sioux River, for which reason the specific name of Sioux Quartzite has been given them. It is an intensely hard rock, breaks in splintery fracture, and a color varying, in different localities, from a light to deep red. The process of metamorphism has been so complete throughout the whole formation that the rock is almost everywhere of uniform texture. The dip is four or five degrees to the northward, and the trend of the outcrop is eastward and westward. This"], [120, "122 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. rock may be quarried in a few rare cases, but usually it cannot be secured in dry forms except that into which it naturally cracks, and the tendency is to angular pieces. It is absolutely indestructible. LOWER SILURIAN SYSTEM. PRIMORDIAL GROUP. Potsdam Sandstone. \u2014 This formation is exposed only in a small portion of the northeastern portion of the State. It is only to be seen in the bases of the bluffs and steep valley sides which border the river there. It may be seen underlying the lower magnesian limestone, St. Peter s sandstone and Trenton limestone, in their regular order, along the bluffs of the Mississippi from the northern boundary of the State as far south as Guttenburg, along the Upper Iowa for a distance of about twenty miles from its mouth, and along a few of the streams which empty into the Mississippi in Allamakee County. It is nearly valueless for economic purposes. No fossils have been discovered in this formation in Iowa. Lower Magnesium Limestone. \u2014 This formation has but little greater geo graphical extent in Iowa than the Potsdam sandstone. It lacks a uniformity of texture and stratification, owing to which it is not generally valuable for building purposes. The only fossils found in this formation in Iowa are a few traces of crinoids, near McGregor. St. Peter s Sandstone. \u2014 This formation is remarkably uniform in thickness throughout its known geographical extent ; and it is evident it occupies a large portion of the northern half of Allamakee County, immediately beneath the drift. TRENTON GROUP. Trenton Limestone. \u2014 With the exception of this, all the limestones of both Upper and Lower Silurian age in Iowa are magnesian limestones \u2014 nearly pure dolomites. This formation occupies large portions of Winnesheik and Alla makee Counties and a portion of Clayton. The greater part of it is useless for economic purposes, yet there are in some places compact and evenly bedded layers, which afford fine material for window caps and sills. In this formation, fossils are abundant, so much so that, in some places, the rock is made up of a mass of shells, corals and fragments of tribolites, cemented by calcareous material into a solid rock. Some of these fossils are new to science and peculiar to Iowa. The Galena Limestone. \u2014 This is the upper formation of the Trenton group. It seldom exceeds twelve miles in width, although it is fully one hundred and fifty miles long. The outcrop traverses portions of the counties of Howard, Winnesheik, Allamakee, Fayette, Clayton, Dubuque and Jackson. It exhibits its greatest development in Dubuque County. It is nearly a pure dolomite, with a slight admixture of silicious matter. It is usually unfit for dressing,"], [121, "123 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. though sometimes near the top of the bed good blocks for dressing are found. This formation is the source of the lead ore of the Dubuque lead mines. The lead region proper is confined to an area of about fifteen miles square in the vicinity of Dubuque. The ore occurs in vertical fissures, which traverse the rock at regular intervals from east to west ; some is found in those which have a north and south direction. The ore is mostly that known as Galena, or sul phuret of lead, very small quantities only of the carbonate being found with it. CINCINNATI GROUP. Maquoketa Shales. \u2014 The surface occupied by this formation is singularly long and narrow, seldom reaching more than a mile or two in width, but more than a hundred miles in length. Its most southerly exposure is in the bluffs of the Mississippi near Bellevue, in Jackson County, and the most northerly yet recognized is in the western part of Winnesheik County. The whole formation is largely composed of bluish and brownish shales, sometimes slightly arena ceous, sometimes calcareous, which weather into a tenacious clay upon the sur face, and the soil derived from it is usually stiff and clayey. Its economic value is very slight. Several species of fossils which characterize the Cincinnati group are found in the Maquoketa shales ; but they contain a larger number that have been found anywhere else than in these shales in Iowa, and their distinct faunal char acteristics seem to warrant the separation of the Maquoketa shales as a distinct formation from any others of the group. UPPER SILURIAN SYSTEM. NIAGARA G^OUP. Niagara Limestone. \u2014 The area occupied by the Niagara limestone is nearly one hundred and sixty miles long from north to south, and forty and fifty miles wide. This formation is entirely a magnesian limestone, with in some places a con siderable proportion of silicious matter in the form of chert or coarse flint. A large part of it is evenly bedded, and probably affords the best and greatest amount of quarry rock in the State. The quarries at Anamosa, LeClaire and Farley are all opened in this formation. DEVONIAN SYSTEM. HAMILTON GROUP. Hamilton Limestone. \u2014 The area of surface occupied by the Hamilton lime stone and shales is fully as great as those by all the formations of both Upper and Lower Silurian age in the State. It is nearly two hundred miles long and from forty to fifty miles broad. The general trend is northwestward and south eastwsvrd. Although a large part of the material of this formation is practically quite \u2022worthless, yet other portions are valuable for economic purposes ; and having a"], [122, "124 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. large geographical extent in the State, is one of the most important formations, in a practical point of view. At Waverly, Bremer County, its value for the production of hydraulic lime has been practically demonstrated. The heavier and more uniform magnesian beds furnish material for bridge piers and other material requiring strength and durability. All the Devonian strata of Iowa evidently belong to a single epoch, and re ferable to the Hamilton, as recognized by New York geologists. The most conspicuous and characteristic fossils of this formation are bra chiopod, mollusks and corals. The coral Acervularia Davidsoni occurs near Iowa City, and is known as \" Iowa City Marble,\" and \" bird's-eye marble.\" CARBONIFEROUS SYSTEM. Of the three groups of formations that constitute the carboniferous system, viz., the subcarboniferous, coal measures and permian, only the first two are found in Iowa. SUBCARBONIFEROUS GROUP. The area of the surface occupied by this group is very large. Its eastern border passes from the northeastern part of Winnebago County, with consider able directness in a southeasterly direction to the northern part of Washington County. Here it makes a broad and direct bend nearly eastward, striking the Mississippi River at Muscatine. The southern and western boundary is to a considerable extent the same as that which separates it from the coal field. From the southern part of Pocahontas County it passes southeast to Fort Dodge, thence to Webster City, thence to a point three or four miles northeast of El dora, in Hardin County, thence southward to the middle of the north line of Jasper County, thence southeastward to Sigourney, in Keokuk County, thence to the northeastern corner of Jefferson County, thence sweeping a few miles eastward to the southeast corner of Van Buren County. Its area is nearly two hundred and fifty miles long, and from twenty to fifty miles wide. The Kinderhook Beds. \u2014 The most southerly exposure of these beds is near the mouth of Skunk River, in Des Moines County. The most northerly now known is in the eastern part of Pocahontas County, more than two hundred miles distant. The principal exposures of this formation are along the bluffs which border the Mississippi and Skunk Rivers, where they form the eastern and northern boundary of Des Moines County, along English River, in Wash ington County ; along the Iowa River, in Tama, Marshall, Hamlin and Frank lin Counties ; and along the Des Moines River, in Humboldt County. The economic value of this formation is very considerable, particularly in the northern portion of the region it occupies. In Pocahontas and Humboldt Counties it is almost invaluable, as no other stone except a few boulders are found here. At Iowa Falls the lower division is very good for building pur poses. In Marshall County all the limestone to be obtained comes from this formation, and the quarries near LeGrand are very valuable. At this point"], [123, "125 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. some of the layers are finely veined with peroxide of iron, and are wrought into ornamental and useful objects. In Tama County, the oolitic member is well exposed, where it is manufac tured into lime. It is not valuable for building, as upon exposure to atmosphere and frost, it crumbles to pieces. The remains of fishes are the only fossils yet discovered in this formation that can be referred to the sub-kingdom vertebrata ; and so far as yet recog nized, they all belong to the order selachians. Of articulates, only two species have been recognized, both of which belong to the genus phillipsia. The sub-kingdom mollusca is largely represented. The RADIATA are represented by a few crinoids, usually found in a very im perfect condition. The sub-kingdom is also represented by corals. The prominent feature in the life of this epoch was molluscan ; so much so in fact as to overshadow all other branches of the animal kingdom. The pre vailing classes are: lamellibranchiates, in the more arenaceous portions; and brachiopods, in the more calcareous portions. No remains of vegetation have been detected in any of the strata of this formation. The Burlington Limestone. \u2014 This formation consists of two distinct calca reous divisions, which are separated by a series of silicious beds. Both divi sions are eminently crinoidal. The southerly dip of the Iowa rocks carries the Burlington limestone down, so that it is seen for the last time in this State in the valley of Skunk River, near the southern boundary of Des Moines County. The most northerly point at which it has been recognized is in the northern part of Washington County. It probably exists as far north as Marshall County. This formation affords much valuable material for economic purposes. The upper division furnishes excellent common quarry rock. The great abundance and variety of its fossils \u2014 crinoids \u2014 now known to be more than three hundred, have justly attracted the attention of geologists in all parts of the world. The only remains of vertebrates discovered in this formation are those of fishes, and consist of teeth and spines ; bone of bony fishes, like those most common at the present day, are found in these rocks. On Buffington Creek, in Louisa County, is a stratum in an exposure so fully charged with these remains that it might with propriety be called bone breccia. Remains of articulates are rare in this formation. So far as yet discovered, they are confined to two species of tribolites of the genus phillipsia. Fossil shells are very common. The two lowest classes of the sub-kingdom radiata are represented in the genera zaphrentis, amplexus and syringapora, while the highest class \u2014 echino derms \u2014 are found in most extraordinary profusion."], [124, "126 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. The Keokuk Limestone. \u2014 It is only in the four counties of Lee, Van Buren, Henry and Des Moines that this formation is to be seen. In some localities the upper silicious portion of this formation is known as the Geode bed. It is not recognizable in the northern portion of the formation, nor in connection with it where it is exposed, about eighty miles below Keokuk. The geodes of the Geode bed are more or less spherical masses of silex, usually hollow and lined with crystals of quartz. The outer crust is rough and unsightly, but the crystals which stud the interior are often very beautiful. They vary in size from the size of a walnut to a foot in diameter. The economic value of this formation is very great. Large quantities of its stone have been used in the finest structures in the State, among which are the post offices at Dubuque and Des Moines. The principal quarries are along the banks of the Mississippi, from Keokuk to Nauvoo. The only vertebrate fossils found in the formation are fishes, all belonging to the order selachians, some of which indicate that their owners reached a length of twenty-five or thirty feet. Of the articulates, only two species of the genus phillipsia have been found in this formation. Of the mollusks, no cephalopods have yet been recognized in this formation in this State ; gasteropods are rare ; brachiopods and polyzoans are quite abundant. Of radiates, corals of genera zaphrentes, amplexus and aulopera are found, but crinoids are most abundant. Of the low forms of animal life, the protozoans, a small fossil related to the sponges, is found in this formation in small numbers. The St. Louis Limestone. \u2014 This is the uppermost of the subcarboniferous group in Iowa. The superficial area it occupies is comparatively small, because it consists of long, narrow strips, yet its exten* is very great. It is first seen resting on the geode division of the Keokuk limestone, near Keokuk. Pro ceeding northward, it forms a narrow border along the edge of the coal fields in Lee, Des Moines, Henry, Jefferson, Washington, Keokuk and Mahaska Counties. It is then lost sight of until it appears again in the banks of Boone River, where it again passes out of view under the coal measures until it is next seen in the banks of the Des Moines, near Fort Dodge. As it exists in Iowa, it consists of three tolerably distinct subdivisions \u2014 the magnesian, arena ceous and calcareous. The upper division furnishes excellent material for quicklime, and when quarries are well opened, as in the northwestern part of Van Buren County, large blocks are obtained. The sandstone, or middle division, is of little economic value. The lower or magnesian division furnishes a valuable and durable stone, exposures of which are found on Lick Creek, in Van Buren County, and on Long Creek, seven miles west of Burlington. Of the fossils of this formation, the vertebrates are represented only by the remains of fish, belonging to the two orders, selachians and ganoids. The"], [125, "127 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. articulates are represented by one species of the trilobite, genus phillipsia, and two ostracoid, genera, cythre and beyricia. The mollusks distinguish this formation more than any other branch of the animal kingdom. Radiates are exceedingly rare, showing a marked contrast between this formation and the two preceding it. The rocks of the subcarboniferous period have in other countries, and in other parts of our own country, furnished valuable minerals, and even coal, but in Iowa the economic value is confined to its stone alone. The Lower Silurian, Upper Silurian and Devonian rocks of Iowa are largely composed of limestone. Magnesia also enters largely into the subcarbon iferous group. With the completion of the St. Louis limestone, the production of the magnesian limestone seems to have ceased among the rocks of Iowa. Although the Devonian age has been called the age of fishes, yet so far as Iowa is concerned, the rocks of no period can compare with the subcarbon iferous in the abundance and variety of the fish remains, and, for this reason, the Burlington and Keokuk limestones will in the future become more famous among geologists, perhaps, than any other formations in North America. It will be seen that the Chester limestone is omitted from the subcarbon iferous group, and which completes the full geological series. It is probable the whole surface of Iowa was above the sea during the time of the formation of the Chester limestone to the southward about one hundred miles. At the close of the epoch of the Chester limestone, the shallow seas in which the lower co\u00c6l measures were formed again occupied the land, extending almost as far north as that sea had done in which the Kinderhook beds were formed, and to the northeastward its deposits extended beyond the subcarbon iferous groups, outlines of which are found upon the next, or Devonian rock. THE COAL-MEASURE GROUP. The coal-measure group of Iowa is properly divided into three formations, viz., the lower, middle and upper coal measures, each having a vertical thick ness of about two hundred feet. A line drawn upon the map of Iowa as follows, will represent the eastern and northern boundaries of the coal fields of the State : Commencing at the southeast corner of Van Buren County, carry the line to the northeast corner of Jefferson County by a slight easterly curve through the western portions of Lee and Henry Counties. Produce this line until it reaches a' point six or eight miles northward from the one last named, and then carry it northwest ward, keeping it at about the same distance to the northward of Skunk River and its north branch that it had at first, until it reaches the southern boundary of Marshall County, a little west of its center. Then carry it to a point"], [126, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 128 three or four miles northeast from Eldora, in Hardin County ; thence west ward to a point a little north of Webster City, in Hamilton County ; and thence further westward to a point a little north of Fort Dodge, in Webster County. Lower Coal Measures. \u2014 In consequence of the recedence to the southward of the borders of the middle and upper coal measures, the lower coal measures alone exist to the eastward and northward of Des Moines River. They also occupy a large area westward and southward of that river, but their southerly dip passes them below the middle coal measures at no great distance from the river. No other formation in the whole State possesses the economic value of the lower coal measures. The clay that underlies almost every bed of coal furnishes a large amount of material for potters' use. The sandstone of these measures is usually soft and unfit, but in some places, as near Red Rock, in Marion County, blocks of large dimensions are obtained which make good building material, samples of which can be seen in the State Arsenal, at Des Moines. On the whole, that portion of the State occupied by the lower coal measures, is not well supplied with stone. But few fossils have been found in any of the strata of the lower coal meas ures, but such animal remains as have been found are without exception of marine origin. Of fossil plants found in these measures, all probably belong to the class acrogens. Specimens of catamites, and several species of ferns, are found in all of the coal measures, but the genus lepidodendron seems not to have existed later than the epoch of the middle coal measures. Middle Coal Measures. \u2014 This formation within the State of Iowa occupies a narrow belt of territory in the southern central portion of the State, embrac ing a superficial area of about fourteen hundred square miles. The counties more or less underlaid by this formation are Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Madison, Warren, Clarke, Lucas, Monroe, Wayne and Appanoose. This formation is composed of alternating beds of clay, sandstone and lime stone, the clays or shales constituting the bulk of the formation, the limestone occurring in their bands, the lithological peculiarities of which offer many con trasts to the limestones of the upper and lower coal measures. The formation is also characterized by regular wave-like undulations, with a parallelism which indicates a widespread disturbance, though no dislocation of the strata have been discovered. Generally speaking, few species of fossils occur in these beds. Some of the shales and sandstone have afforded a few imperfectly preserved land plants \u2014 three or four species of ferns, belonging to the genera. Some of the carbonif erous shales afford beautiful specimens of what appear to have been sea-weeds. Radiates are represented by corals. The mollusks are most numerously repre sented. Trilubitcs and ostraeoids are the only remains known of articulates."], [127, "129 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Vertebrates are only known by the remains of salachians, or sharks, and ganoids. Upper Coal Measures. \u2014 The area occupied by this formation in Iowa is very great, comprising thirteen whole counties, in the southwestern part of the State. It adjoins by its northern and eastern boundaries the area occupied by the middle coal measures. The prominent lithological features of this formation are its limestones, yet it contains a considerable proportion of shales and sandstones. Although it is known by the name of upper coal measures, it contains but a single bed of coal, and that only about twenty inches in maximum thickness. The limestone exposed in this formation furnishes good material for building as in Madison and Fremont Counties. The sandstones are quite worthless. No beds of clay for potter's use are found in the whole formation. The fossils in this formation are much more numerous than in either the middle or lower coal measures. The vertebrates are represented by the fishes of the orders selachians and ganoids. The articulates are represented by the trilobites and ostracoids. Mollusks are represented by the classes cephalopoda, gasteropoda, lamelli, branchiata, brachiapoda and polyzoa. Radiates are more numerous than in the lower and middle coal measures. Protogoans are repre sented in the greatest abundance, some layers of limestone being almost entirely composed of their small fusiform shells. CRETACEOUS SYSTEM There being no rocks, in Iowa, of permian, triassic or Jurassic age, the next strata in the geological series are of the cretaceous age. They are found in the western half of the State, and do not dip, as do all the other formations upon which they rest, to the southward and westward, but have a general dip of their own to the north of westward, which, however, is very slight. Although the actual exposures of cretaceous rocks are few in Iowa, there is reason to believe that nearly all the western half of the State was originally occupied by them ; but being very friable, they have been removed by denuda tion, which has taken place at two separate periods. The first period was during its elevation from the cretaceous sea, and during the long tertiary age that passed between the time of that elevation and the commencement of the glacial epoch. The second period was during the glacial epoch, when the ice produced their entire removal over considerable areas. ' It is difficult to indicate the exact boundaries of these rocks ; the following will approximate the outlines of the area : From the northeast corner to the southwest corner of Kossuth County ; thence to the southeast corner of Guthrie County; thence to the southeast corner of Cass County ; thence to the middle of the south boundary of Mont gomery County ; thence to the middle of the north boundary of Pottawattamie County ; thence to the middle of the south boundary of Woodbury County ;"], [128, "130 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. thence to Sergeant's bluffs; up the Missouri and Big Sioux Rivers to the northwest corner of the State ; eastward along the State line to the place of beginning. All the cretaceous rocks in Iowa are a part of the same deposits farther up the Missouri River, and in reality form their eastern boundary. Nishnabotany Sandstone.\u2014 This rock has the most easterly and southerly extent of the cretaceous deposits of Iowa, reaching the southeastern part of Guthrie County and the southern part of Montgomery County. To the north ward, it passes beneath the Woodbury sandstones and shales, the latter passing beneath the inoceramus, or chalky, beds. This sandstone is, with few excep tions, almost valueless for economic purposes. The only fossils found in this formation are a few fragments of angiosper mous leaves. Woodbury Sandstones and Shales. \u2014 These strata rest upon the Nishna botany sandstone, and have not been observed outside of Woodbury County, hence their name. Their principal exposure is at Sergeant's Bluffs, seven miles below Sioux City. This rock has no value except for purposes of common masonry. Fossil remains are rare. Detached scales of a lepidoginoid species have been detected, but no other vertebrate remains. Of remains of vegetation, leaves of salix meekii and sassafras cretaceum have been occasionally found. Inoceramus Beds. \u2014 These beds rest upon the Woodbury sandstones and shales. They have not been observed in Iowa, except in the bluffs which border the Big Sioux River in Woodbury and Plymouth Counties. They are composed almost entirely of calcareous material, the upper portion of which is extensively used for lime. No building material is to be obtained from these beds ; and the only value they possess, except lime, are the marls, which at some time may be useful on the soil of the adjacent region. The only vertebrate remains found in the cretaceous rocks are the fishes. Those in the inoceramus beds of Iowa are two species of squoloid selachians, or cestratront, and three genera of teliosts. Molluscan remains are rare. PEAT. Extensive beds of peat exist in Northern Middle Iowa, which, it is esti- mated, contain the following areas : Counties. Acres. Cerro Gordo 1,500 Worth 2,i 00 Winnebago 2,000 Hancock 1,500 Wright 500 Kossuth 700 Dickinson 80 . Several other counties contain peat beds, but the character of the peat is inferior to that in the northern part of the State. The character of the peat"], [129, "131 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. named is equal to that of Ireland. The beds are of an average depth of four feet. It is estimated that each acre of these beds will furnish two hundred and fifty tons of dry fuel for each foot in depth. At present, owing to the sparse ness of the population, this peat is not utilized ; but, owing to its great distance from the coal fields and the absence of timber, the time is coming when their value will be realized, and the fact demonstrated that Nature has abundantly compensated the deficiency of other fuel. GYPSUM. The only deposits of the sulphates of the alkaline earths of any economic value in Iowa are those of gypsum at and in the vicinity of Fort Dodge, in Webster County. All others are small and unimportant. The deposit occupies a nearly central position in Webster County, the Des Moines River running nearly centrally through it, along the valley sides of which the gypsum is seen in the form of ordinary rock cliff and ledges, and also occurring abundantly in similar positions along both sides of the valleys of the smaller streams and of the numerous ravines coming into the river valley. The most northerly known limit of the deposit is at a point near the mouth of Lizard Creek, a tributary of the Des Moines River, and almost adjoining the town of Fort Dodge. The most southerly point at which it has been found exposed is about six miles, by way of the river, from this northerly point before mentioned. Our knowledge of the width of the area occupied by it is limited by the exposures seen in the valleys of the small streams and in the ravines which come into the valley within the distance mentioned. As one goes up these ravines and minor valleys, the gypsum becomes lost beneath the over lying drift. There can be no doubt that the different parts of this deposit, now disconnected by the valleys and ravines having been cut through it, were orig inally connected as a continuous deposit, and there seems to be as little reason to doubt that the gypsum still extends to considerable distance on each side of the valley of the river beneath the drift which covers the region to a depth of from twenty to sixty feet. The country round about this region has the prairie surface approximating a general level which is so characteristic of the greater part of the State, and which exists irrespective of the character or geological age of the strata beneath, mainly because the drift is so deep and uniformly distributed that it frequently almost alone gives character to the surface. The valley sides of the Des Moines River, in the vicinity of Fort Dodge, are somewhat abrupt, having a depth there from the general level of the upland of about one hundred and seventy feet, and consequently presents somewhat bold and interesting features in the land scape. As one walks up and down the creeks and ravines which come into the valley of the Des Moines River there, he sees the gypsum exposed on either side of them, jutting out from beneath the drift in the form of"], [130, "132 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. ledges and bold quarry fronts, having almost the exact appearance of ordinary limestone exposures, so horizontal and regular are its lines of stratification, and so similar in color is it to some varieties of that rock. The principal quarries now opened are on Two Mile Creek, a couple of miles below Fort Dodge. The reader will please bear in mind that the gypsum of this remarkable deposit does not occur in \"heaps\" or \"nests,\" as it does in most deposits of gypsum in the States farther eastward, but that it exists here in the form of a regularly stratified, continuous formation, as uniform in texture, color and quality throughout the whole region, and from top to bottom of the deposit as the granite of the Quincy quarries is. Its color is a uniform gray, result ing from alternating fine horizontal lines of nearly white, with similar lines of darker shade. The gypsum of the white lines is almost entirely pure, the darker lines containing the impurity. This is at intervals barely sufficient in amount to cause the separation of the mass upon those lines into beds or layers, thus facilitating the quarrying of it into desired shapes. These bedding sur faces have occasionally a clayey feeling to the touch, but there is nowhere any intercalation of clay or other foreign substance in a separate form. The deposit is known to reach a thickness of thirty feet at the quarries referred to, but although it will probably be found to exceed this thickness at some other points, at the natural exposures, it is seldom seen to be more than from ten to twenty feet thick. Since the drift is usually seen to rest directly upon the gypsum, with noth ing intervening, except at a few points where traces appear of an overlying bed of clayey material without doubt of the same age as the gypsum, the latter probably lost something of its thickness by mechanical erosion during the glacial epoch ; and it has, doubtless, also suffered some diminution of thickness since then by solution in the waters which constantly percolate through the drift from the surface. The drift of this region being somewhat clayey, partic ulary in its lower part, it has doubtless served in some degree as a protection against the diminution of the gypsum by solution in consequence of its partial imperviousness to water. If the gypsum had been covered by a deposit of sand instead of the drift clays, it would have no doubt long since disappeared by being dissolved in the water that would have constantly reached it from the sur face. Water merely resting upon it would not dissolve it away to any extent, but it rapidly disappears under the action of running water. Where little rills of water at the time of every rain run over the face of an unused quarry, from the surface above it, deep grooves are thereby cut into it, giving it somewhat the appearance of melting ice around a waterfall. The fact that gypsum is now suffering a constant, but, of course, very slight, diminution, is apparent in the fact the springs of the region contain more or less of it in solution in their waters. An analysis of water from one of these springs will be found in Prof. Emery's report."], [131, "133 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Besides the clayey beds that are sometimes seen to rest upon the gypsum, there are occasionally others seen beneath them that are also of the same age, and not of the age of the coal-measure strata upon which they rest. Age of the Gypsum Deposit. \u2014 In neither the gypsum nor the associated clays has any trace of any fossil remains been found, nor has any other indica tion of its geological age been observed, except that which is afforded by its stratigraphical relations ; and the most that can be said with certainty is that it is newer than the coal measures, and older than the drift. The indications afforded by the stratigraphical relations of the gypsum deposit of Fort Dodge are, however, of considerable value. As already shown, it rests in that region directly and unconformably upon the lower coal measures ; but going southward from there, the whole series of coal-measure strata from the top of the subcarboniferous group to the upper coal measures, inclusive, can be traced without break or unconformability. The strata of the latter also may be traced in the same manner up into the Permian rocks of Kansas; and through this long series, there is no place or horizon which suggests that the gypsum deposit might belong there. Again, no Tertiary deposits are known to exist within or near the borders of Iowa to suggest that the gypsum might be of that age ; nor are any of the pal\u00e6ozoic strata newer than the subcarboniferous unconformable upon each other as the other gypsum is unconformable upon the strata beneath it. It therefore seems, in a measure, conclusive, that the gypsum is of Mesozoic age, perhaps older than the Cretaceous. Lithological Origin. \u2014 As little can be said with certainty concerning the lithological origin of this deposit as can be said concerning its geological age, for it seems to present itself in this relation, as in the former one, as an isolated fact. None of the associated strata show any traces of a double decomposition of pre-existing materials, such as some have supposed all deposits of gypsum to have resulted from. No considerable quantities of oxide of iron nor any trace of native sulphur have been found in connection with it ; nor has any salt been found in the waters of the region. These substances are common in association with other gypsum deposits, and are regarded by some persons as indicative of the method of or resulting from their origin as such. Throughout the whole region, the Fort Dodge gypsum has the exact appearance of a sedimentary deposit. It is arranged in layers like the regular layers of limestone, and the whole mass, from top to bottom, is traced with fine horizontal lamin\u00e6 of alter nating white and gray gypsum, parallel with the bedding surfaces of the layers, but the whole so intimately blended as to form a solid mass. The darker lines contain almost all the impurity there is in the gypsum, and that impurity is evidently sedimentary in its character. Frc~n these facts, and also from the further one that no trace of fossil remains has been detected in the gypsum, it seems not unreasonable to entertain the opinion that the gypsum of Fort Dodge originated as a chemical precipitation in comparatively still waters which were"], [132, "134 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. saturated with sulphate of lime and destitute of life ; its stratification and impurities being deposited at the same time as clayey impurities which had been held suspended in the same waters. Physical Properties. \u2014 Much has already been said of the physical proper ties or character of this gypsum, but as it is so different in some respects from that of other deposits, there are yet other matters worthy of mention in connec tion with those. According to the results of a complete and exhaustive anal ysis by Prof. Emery, the ordinary gray gypsum contains only about eight per cent, of impurity ; and it is possible that the average impurity for the whole deposit will not exceed that proportion, so uniform in quality is it from to top to bottom and from one end of the region to the other. When it is remembered that plaster for agricultural purposes is sometimes prepared from gypsum that contains as much as thirty per cent, of impurity, it will be seen that ours is a very superior article for such purposes. The impu rities are also of such a character that they do not in any way interfere with its value for use in the arts. Although the gypsum rock has a gray color, it becomes quite white by grinding, and still whiter by the calcining process nec essary in the preparation of plaster of Paris. These tests have all been practi cally made in the rooms of the Geological Survey, and the quality of the plaster of Paris still further tested by actual use and experiment. No hesitation, therefore, is felt in stating that the Fort Dodge gypsum is of as good a quality as any in the country, even for the finest uses. In view of the bounteousness of the primitive fertility of our Iowa soils, many persons forget that a time may come when Nature will refuse to respond so generously to our demand as she does now, without an adequate return. Such are apt to say that this vast deposit of gypsum is valueless to our com monwealth, except to the small extent that it may be used in the arts. This is undoubtedly a short-sighted view of the subject, for the time is even now rapidly passing away when a man may purchase a new farm for less money than he can re-fertilize and restore the partially wasted primitive fertility of the one he now occupies. There are farms even now in a large part of the older settled portions of the State that would be greatly benefited by the proper application of plaster, and such areas will continue to increase until it will be difficult to estimate the value of the deposit of gypsum at Fort Dodge. It should be remembered, also, that the inhabitants of an extent of country adjoining our State more than three times as great as its own area will find it more convenient to obtain their supplies from Fort Dodge than from any other source. For want of direct railroad communication between this region and other parts of the State, the only use yet made of the gypsum by the inhabitants is for the purposes of ordinary building stone. It is so compact that it is found to be comparatively unaffected by the frost, and its ordinary situation in walls of houses is such that it is protected from the dissolving action of water, which"], [133, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 135 can at most reach it only from occasional rains, and the effect of these is too slight to be perceived after the lapse of several years. One of the citizens of Fort Dodge, Hon. John F. Duncombe, built a large, fine residence of it. in 1861, the walls of which appear as unaffected by exposure and as beautiful as they were when first erected. It has been so long and successfully used for building stone by the inhabitants that they now prefer it to the limestone of good quality, which also exists in the immediate vicinity. This preference is due to the cheapness of the gypsum, as compared with the stone. The cheapness of the former is largely due to the facility with which it is quarried and wrought. Several other houses have been constructed of it in Fort Dodge, including the depot building of the Dubuque & Sioux City Rail road. The company have also constructed a large culvert of the same material to span a creek near the town, limestone only being used for the lower courses, which come in contact with the water. It is a fine arch, each stone of gypsum being nicely hewn, and it will doubtless prove a very durable one. Many of the sidewalks in the town are made of the slabs or flags of gypsum which occur in some of the quarries in the form of thin layers. They are more durable than their softness would lead one to suppose. They also possess an advantage over stone in not becoming slippery when worn. The method adopted in quarrying and dressing the blocks of gypsum is peculiar, and quite unlike that adopted in similar treatment of ordinary stone. Taking a stout auger-bit of an ordinary brace, such as is used by carpenters, and filing the cutting parts of it into a peculiar form, the quarryman bores his holes into the gypsum quarry for blasting, in the same manner and with as great facility as a carpenter would bore hard wood. The pieces being loosened by blasting, they are broken up with sledges into convenient sizes, or hewn into the desired shapes by means of hatchets or ordinary chopping axes, or cut by means of ordinary wood-saws. So little grit does the gypsum contain that these tools, made for working wood, are found to be better adapted for working the former substance than those tools are which are universally used for work ing stone. MINOR DEPOSITS OF SULPHATE OF LIME. Besides the great gypsum deposit of Fort Dodge, sulphate of lime in the various forms of fibrous gypsum, selenite, and small, amorphous masses, has also been discovered in various formations in different parts of the State, includ ing the coal -measure shales near Fort Dodge, where it exists in small quanti ties, quite independently of the great gypsum deposit there. The quantity of gypsum in these minor deposits is always too small to be of any practical value, and frequently minute. They usually occur in shales and shaly clays, asso ciated with strata that contain more or less sulphuret of iron (iron pyrites). Gypsum has thus been detected in the coal measures, the St. Louis limestone, the cretaceous strata, and also in the lead caves of Dubuque. In most of these cases it is evidently the result of double decomposition of iron pyrites and car-"], [134, "136 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. bonate of lime, previously existing there ; in which cases the gypsum is of course not an original deposit as the great one at Fort Dodge is supposed to be. The existence of these comparatively minute quantities of gypsum in the shales of the coal measures and the subcarboniferous limestone which are exposed within the region of and occupy a stratigraphical position beneath the great gypsum deposits, suggests the possibility that the former may have originated as a precipitate from percolating waters, holding gypsum in solution which they had derived from that deposit in passing over or through it. Since, however, the same substance is found in similar smill quantities and under similar con ditions in regions where they could have had no possible connection with that deposit, it is believed that none of those mentioned have necessarily originated from it, not even those that are found in close proximity to it. The gypsum found in the lead caves is usually in the form of efflorescent fibers, and is always in small quantity. In the lower coal-measure shale near Fort Dodge, a small mass was found in the form of an intercalated layer, which hid a distinct fibrous structure, the fibers being perpendicular to the plane of the layer. The same mass had also distinct, horizontal planes of cleavage at right angles with the perpendicular fibers. Thus, being more or less transpa rent, the mass combined the characters of both fibrous gypsum and selenite. No anhydrous sulphate of lime [anhydrite) has been found in connection with the great gypsum deposit, nor elsewhere in Iowa, so far as yet known. SULPHATE OF STRONTIA. (Celes'ine.) The only locality at which this interesting mineral has yet been found in Iowa, or, so far as is known, in the great valley of the Mississippi, is at Fort Dodge. It occurs there in very small quantity in both the shales of the lower coal measures and in the clays that overlie the gypsum deposit, and which are regarded as of the same age with it. The first is just below the city, near Rees' coal bank, and occurs as a layer intercalated among the coal measure shales, amounting in quantity to only a few hundred pounds' weight. The mineral is fibrous and crystalline, the fibers being perpendicular to the plane of the layer. Breaking also with more or less distinct horizontal planes of cleavage, it resem bles, in physical character, the layer of fibro-crystalline gypsum before men tioned. Its color is light blue, is transparent and shows crystaline facets upon both the upper and under surfaces of the layer; those of the upper surface being smallest and most numerous. It breaks up readily into small masses along the lines of the perpendicular fibers or columns. The layer is probably not more than a rod in extent in any direction and about three inches in maxi mum thickness. Apparent lines of stratification occur in it, cor responding with those of the shales which imbed it. The other deposit was still smaller in amount, and occurred as a mass of crystals imbedded in the clays that overlie the gypsum at Cummins' quarry in"], [135, "137 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. the valley of Soldier Creek, upon the north side of the town. The mineral is in this case nearly colorless, and but for the form of the separate crystals would closely resemble masses of impure salt. The crystals are so closely aggregated that they enclose but little impurity in the mass, but in almost all cases their fundamental forms are obscured. This mineral has almost no real practical value, and its occurrence, as described, is interesting only as a mineralogical fact. SULPHATE OF BARYTA. (Barytcs, Heavy Spar.) This mineral has been found only in minute quantities in Iowa. It has been detected in the coal-measure shales of Decatur, Madison and Marion Counties, the Devonian limestone of Johnson and Bremer Counties and in the lead caves of Dubuque. In all these cases, it is in the form of crystals or small crystalline masses. SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA. (Epsomite.) Epsomite, or native epsom salts, having been discovered near Burlington, we have thus recognized in Iowa all the sulphates of the alkaline earths of natural origin ; all of them, except the sulphate of lime, being in very small quantity. Even if the sulphate of magnesia were produced in nature, in large quantities, it is so very soluble that it can accumulate only in such positions as afford it complete shelter from the rains or running water The epsomite mentioned was found beneath the overhanging cliff of Burlington limestone, near Starr's mill, which are represented in the sketch upon another page, illus- trating the subcarboniferous rocks. It occurs in the form of efflorescent encrus- tations upon the surface of stones and in similar small fragile masses among the fine debris that has fallen down beneath the overhanging cliff. The projection of the cliff over the perpendicular face of the strata beneath amounts to near twenty feet at the point where epsomite was found. Consequently the rains never reach far beneath it from any quarter. The rock upon which the epsom- ite accumulates is an impure limestone, containing also some carbonate of mag- nesia, together with a small proportion of iron pyrites in a finely divided con- dition. It is doubtless by double decomposition of these that the epsomite re sults. By experiments with this native salt in the office of the Survey, a fine article of epsom salts was produced, but the quantity that might be annually obtained there would amount to only a few pounds, and of course is of no prac tical value whatever, on account of its cheapness in the market. CLIMATOLOGY. No extended record of the climatology of Iowa has been made, yet much of great value may be learned from observations made at a single point. Prof. T. S. Parvin, of the State University, has recorded observations made from 1839 to the present time. Previous to 1860, these observations were made at Mus-"], [136, "138 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. catine. Since that date, they were made in Iowa City. The result is that the atmospheric conditions of the climate of Iowa are in the highest degree favor able to health. The highest temperature here occurs in August, while July is the hottest month in the year by two degrees, and January the coldest by three degrees. The mean temperature of April and October most nearly corresponds to the mean temperature of the year, as well as their seasons of Spring and Fall, while that of Summer and Winter is best represented in that of August and December. The period of greatest heat ranges from June 22d to August 31st ; the next mean time being July 27th. The lowest temperature extends from December 16th to February 15th, the average being January 20th \u2014 the range in each case being two full months. The climate of Iowa embraces the range of that of New York, Pennsyl vania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. The seasons are not characterized by the frequent and sudden changes so common in the latitudes further south. The temperature of the Winters is somewhat lower than States eastward, but of other seasons it is higher. The atmosphere is dry and invigorating. The surface of the State being free at all seasons of the year from stagnant water, with good breezes at nearly all seasons, the miasmatic and pulmonary diseases are unknown. Mortuary statistics show this to be one of the most healthful States in the Union, being one death to every ninety-four persons. The Spring, Summer and Fall months are delightful ; indeed, the glory of Iowa is her Autumn, and nothing can transcend the splendor of her Indian Summer, which lasts for weeks, and finally blends, almost imperceptibly, into Winter."], [137, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. DISCOVERY AND OCCUPATION. Iowa, in the symbolical and expressive lauguage of the aboriginal inhab- itants, is said to signify \" The Beautiful Land,\" and was applied to this magnificent and fruitful region by its ancient owners, to express their apprecia- tion of its superiority of climate, soil and location. Prior to 1803, the Mississippi River was the extreme western boundary of the United States. All the great empire lying west of the \" Father of Waters,\" from the Gulf of Mexico on the south to British America on the north, and westward to the Pacific Ocean was a Spanish province. A brief historical sketch of the discovery and occupation of this grand empire by the Spanish and French governments will be a fitting introduction to the history of the young and thriving State of Iowa, which, until the commencement of the present century, was a part of the Spanish possessions in America. Early in the Spring of 1542, fifty years after Columbus discovered the New- World, and one hundred and thirty years before the French missionaries discov- ered its upper waters, Ferdinand De Soto discovered the mouth of the Mississippi River at the mouth of the Washita. After the sudden death of De Soto, in May of the same year, his followers built a small vessel, and in July, 1543, descended the great river to the Gulf of Mexico. In accordance with the usage of nations, under which title to the soil was claimed by right of discovery, Spain, having conquered Florida and discovered the Mississippi, claimed all the territory bordering on that river and the Gulf of Mexico. But it was also held by the European nations that, while discovery gave title, that title must be perfected by actual possession and occupation. Although Spain claimed the territory by right of first discovery, she made no effort to occupy it; by no permanent settlement had she perfected and held her title, and therefore had forfeited it when, at a later period, the Lower Mississippi Valley was re-discovered and occupied by France. The unparalleled labors of the zealous Fnnc'i Jesuits of Canada in penetrating the unknown region of the West, commencing in 1611, form a history of no ordi- nary interest, but have no particular connection with the scope of the present work, until in the Fall of 1665. Pierre Claude Allouez, who had entered Lake Superior in September, and sailed along the southern coast in search of copper, had arrived at the great village of the Chippewas at Chegoincegon. Here a grand council of some ten or twelve of the principal Indian nations was held. The Pottawatomies of Lake Michigan, the Sacs and Foxes of the West, the Hurons from the North, the Illinois from the South, and the Sioux from the land of the prairie and wild rice, were all assembled there. The Illinois told"], [138, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 140 the story of their ancient glory and about the noble river on the banks of which they dwelt. The Sioux also told their white brother of the same great river, and Allouez promised to the assembled tribes the protection of the French nation against all their enemies, native or foreign. The purpose of discovering the great river about which the Indian na tions had given such glowing accounts appears to have originated with Mar quette, in 1669. In the year previous, he and Claude Dablon had established the Mission of St. Mary's, the oldest white settlement within the present limits of the State of Michigan. Marquette was delayed in the execution of his great undertaking, and spent the interval in studying the language and habits of the Illinois Indians, among whom he expected to travel. About this time, the French Government had determined to extend the do minion of France to the extreme western borders of Canada. Nicholas Perrot was sent as the agent of the government, to propose a grand council of the Indian nations, at St. Mary's. When Perrot reached Green Bay, he extended the invitation far and near ; and, escorted by Pottawatomies, repaired on a mission of peace and friend ship to the Miamis, who occupied the region about the present location of Chicago. In May, 1671, a great council of Indians gathered at the Falls of St. Mary, from all parts of the Northwest, from the head waters of the St. Law rence, from the valley of the Mississippi and from the Red River of the North. Perrot met with them, and after grave consultation, formally announced to the assembled nations that their good French Father felt an abiding interest in their welfare, and had placed them all under the powerful protection of the French Government. Marquette, during that same year, had gathered at Point St. Ignace the remn ants of one branch of the Hurons. This station, for a long series of years, was considered the key to the unknown West. The time was now auspicious for the consummation of Marquette's grand project. The successful termination of Perrot's mission, and the general friend liness of the native tribes, rendered the contemplated expedition much less per ilous. But it was not until 1673 that the intrepid and enthusiastic priest was finally ready to depart on his daring and perilous journey to lands never trod by white men. The Indians, who had gathered in large numbers to witness his departure, were astounded at the boldness of the proposed undertaking, and tried to dis courage him, representing that the Indians of the Mississippi Valley were cruel and bloodthirsty, and would resent the intrusion of strangers upon their domain. The great river itself, they said, was the abode of terrible monsters, who could swallow both canoes and men. But Marquette was not to be diverted from his purpose by these fearful re ports. He assured his dusky friends that he was ready to make any sacrifice, even to lay down his life for the sacred cause in which he was engaged. He prayed with them ; and having implored the blessing of God upon his undertak ing, on the 13th day of May, 1673, with Joliet and five Canadian-French voy ageurs, or boatmen, he left the mission on his daring journey. Ascending Green Bay and Fox River, these bold and enthusiastic pioneers of religion and discovery proceeded until they reached a Miami and Kickapoo village, where Marquette was delighted to find \" a beautiful cross planted in the middle of the town, ornamented with white skins, red girdles and bows and arrows, which these good people had offered to the Great Manitou, or God, to thank Him for"], [139, "141 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. che pity He had bestowed on them during the Winter, in having given them abundant chase.\" This was the extreme point beyond which the explorations of the French missionaries had not then extended. Here Marquette was instructed by his Indian hosts in the secret of a root that cures the bite of the venomous rattle snake, drank mineral water with them and was entertained with generous hos pitality. He called together the principal men of the village, and informed them that his companion, Joliet, had been sent by the French Governor of Can ada to discover new countries, to be added to the dominion of France ; but that he, himself, had been sent by the Most High God, to carry the glorious religion of the Cross ; and assured his wondering hearers that on this mission he had no fear of death, to which he knew he would be exposed on his perilous journeys. Obtaining the services of two Miami guides, to conduct his little band to the Wisconsin River, he left the hospitable Indians on the 10th of June. Conduct ing them across the portage, their Indian guides returned to their village, and the little party descended the Wisconsin, to the great river which had so long been so anxiously looked for, and boldly floated down its unknown waters. On the 25th of June, the explorers discovered indications of Indians on the west bank of the river and land d a little above the mouth of the river now known as Des Moines, and for the first time Europeans trod the soil of Iowa. Leaving the Canadians to guard the canoes, Marquette and Joliet boldly fol- lowed the trail into the interior for fourteen miles (some authorities say six), to an Indian village situate on the banks of a river, and discovered two other vil- lages, on the rising ground about half a league distant. Their visit, while it created much astonishment, did not seem to be entirely unexpected, for there was a tradition or prophecy among the Indians that white visitors were to come to them. They were, therefore, received with great respect and hospitality, and were cordially tendered the calumet or pipe of peace. They were informed that this band was a part of the Illini nation and that their village was called Mon- in-gou-ma or Moingona, which was the name of the river on which it stood. This, from its similarity of sound, Marquette corrupted into Des Moines (Monk's River), its present name. Here the voyagers remained six days, learning much of the manners and \u25a0customs of their new friends. The new religion they boldly preached and the authority of the King of France they proclaimed were received without hos- tility or remonstrance by their savage entertainers. On their departure, they were accompanied to their canoes by the chiefs and hundreds of warriors. Marquette received from them the sacred calumet, the emblem of peace and safeguard among the nations, and re-embarked for the rest of his journey. It is needless to follow him further, as his explorations beyond his discovery of Iowa more properly belong to the history of another State. In 1682, La Salle descended the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, and in the aame of the King of France, took formal possession of all the immense region watered by the great river and its tributaries from its source to its mouth, and named it Louisiana, in honor of his master, Louis XIV. The river he called \" Colbert,\" after the French Minister, and at its mouth erected a column and a cross bearing the inscription, in the French language, \"Louis the Great, King of France and Navarre, Reigning April 9th, 1682.\" At the close of the seventeenth century, France claimed, by right of dis covery and occupancy, the whole valley of the Mississippi and its tributaries, including Texas, as far as the Rio del Norte."], [140, "142 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA The province of Louisiana stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the sources of the Tennessee, the Kanawha, the Allegheny and the Monongahela on the east, and the Missouri and the other great tributaries of the Father of Waters on the west. Says Bancroft, \" France had obtained, under Providence, the guardianship of this immense district of country, not, as it proved, for her own benefit, but rather as a trustee for the infant nation by which it was one day to be inherited.\" By the treaty of Utrecht, France ceded to England her possessions in Hudson's Bay, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. France still retained Louisiana ; but the province had so far failed to meet the expectations of the crown and the people that a change in the government and policy of the country was deemed indispensable. Accordingly, in 1711, the province was placed in the hands of a Governor General, with headquarters at Mobile. This govern ment was of brief duration, and in 1712 a charter was granted to Anthony Crozat, a wealthy merchant of Paris, giving him the entire control and mo nopoly of all the trade and resources of Louisiana. But this scheme also failed. Crozat met with no success in his commercial operations ; every Spanish harbor on the Gulf was closed against his vessels ; the occupation of Louisiana was deemed an encroachment on Spanish territory ; Spain was jealous of the am bition of France. Failing in his efforts to open the ports of the district, Crozat \"sought to develop the internal resources of Louisiana, by causing trading posts to be opened, and explorations to be made to its remotest borders. But he actually accomplished nothing for the advancement of the colony. The only prosperity which it ever possessed grew out of the enterprise of humble indi viduals, who had succeeded in instituting a little barter bjtwe^n themselves and the natives, and a petty trade with neighboring European settlements. After a persevering effort of nearly five years, he surrendered his charter in August, 1717.\" Immediately following the surrender of his charter by Crozat, another and more magnificent scheme was inaugurated. The national government of France was deeply involved in debt ; the colonies were nearly bankrupt, and John Law appeared on the scene with his famous Mississippi Company, as the Louisiana branch of the Bank of France. The charter granted to this company gave it a legal existence of twenty-five years, and conferred upon it more extensive powers and privileges than had been granted to Crozat. It invested the new companv with the exclusive privilege of the entire commerce of Louisiana, and of New France, and with authority to enforce their rights. The Company was author ized to monopolize all the trade in the country ; to make treaties with the Indians ; to declare and prosecute war ; to grant lands, erect forts, open mines of precious metals, levy taxes, nominate civil officers, commission those of the army, and to appoint and remove judges, to cast cannon, and build and equip ships of war. All this was to be done with the paper currency of John Law's Bank of France. He had succeeded in getting His Majesty the French King to adopt and sanction his scheme of financial operations both in France and in the colonies, and probably there never was such a huge financial bubble ever blown by a visionary theorist. Still, such was the condition of France that it was accepted as a national deliverance, and Law became the most powerful man in France. He became a Catholic, and was appointed Comptroller General of Finance. Among the first operations of the Company was to send eight hundred emigrants to Louisiana, who arrived at Dauphine Island in 1718."], [141, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 143 In 1719, Philipe Francis Renault arrived in Illinois with two hundred miners and artisans. The war between France and Spain at this time rendered it extremely probable that the Mississippi Valley might become the theater of Spanish hostilities against the French settlements ; to prevent this, as well as to extend French claims, a chain of forts was begun, to keep open the connection between the mouth and the sources of the Mississippi. Fort Orleans, high up the Mississippi River, was erected as an outpost in 1720. The Mississippi scheme was at the zenith of its power and glory in January, 1720, but the gigantic bubble collapsed more suddenly than it had been inflated, and the Company was declared hopelessly bankrupt in May following. France was impoverished by it, both private and public credit were overthrown, capi talists suddenly found themselves paupers, and labor was left without employ ment. The effect on the colony of Louisiana was disastrous. While this -was going on in Lower Louisiana, the region about the lakes was the theater of Indian hostilities, rendering the passage from Canada to Louisiana extremely dangerous for many years. The English had not only extended their Indian trade into the vicinity of the French settlements, but through their friends, the Iroquois, had gained a marked ascendancy over the Foxes, a fierce and powerful tribe, of Iroquois descent, whom they incited to hostilities against the French. The Foxes began their hostilities with the siege of Detroit in 1712, a siege which they continued for nineteen consecutive days, and although the expedition resulted in diminishing their numbers and humbling their pride, yet it was not until after several successive campaigns, embodying the best military resources of New France, had been directed against them, that were finally defeated at the great battles of Butte des Morts, and on the Wisconsin River, and driven west in 1746. The Company, having found that the cost of defending Louisiana exceeded the returns from its commerce, solicited leave to surrender the Mississippi wilderness to the home government. Accordingly, on the 10th of April, 1732, the jurisdiction and control over the commerce reverted to the crown of France. The Company had held possession of Louisiana fourteen years. In 1735, Bien- ville returned to assume command for the King. A glance at a few of the old French settlements will show the progress made in portions of Louisiana during the early part of the eighteenth century. As early as 1705, traders and hunters had penetrated the fertile regions of the Wabash, and from this region, at that early date, fifteen thousand hides and skins had been collected and sent to Mobile for the European market. In the year 1716, the French population on the Wabash kept up a lucrative commerce with Mobile by means of traders and voyageurs. The Ohio River was comparatively unknown. In 1746, agriculture on the Wabash had attained to greater prosperity than in any of the French settlements besides, and in that year six hundred barrels of flour were manufactured and shipped to New Orleans, together with consider- able quantities of hides, peltry, tallow and beeswax. In the Illinois country, also, considerable settlements had been made, so that, in 1730, they embraced one hundred and forty French families, about six hundred \" converted Indians,\" and many traders and voyageurs. In 1753, the first actual conflict arose between Louisiana and the Atlantic colonies. From the earliest advent of the Jesuit fathers, up to the period of which we speak, the great ambition of the French had been, not alone to preserve their possessions in the West, but by every possible means to prevent the slightest attempt of the English, east of the mountains, to extend their settle-"], [142, "144 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. ments toward the Mississippi. France was resolved on retaining possession of the great territory which her missionaries had discovered and revealed to the world. French commandants had avowed their purpose of seizing every Englishman within the Ohio Valley. The colonies of Pennsylvania, New York and Virginia were most affected by the encroachments of France in the extension of her dominion, and particularly in the great scheme of uniting Canada with Louisiana. To carry out this purpose, the French had taken possession of a tract of country claimed by Vir ginia, and had commenced a line of forts extending from the lakes to the Ohio River. Virginia was not only alive to her own interests, but attentive to the vast importance of an immediate and effectual resistance on the part of all the English colonies to the actual and contemplated encroachments of the French. In 1753, Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia, sent George Washington, then a young man just twenty-one, to demand of the French commandant \" a reason for invading British dominions while a solid peace subsisted.\" Washington met the French commandant, Gardeur de St. Pierre, on the head waters of the Alleghany, and having communicated to him the object of his journey, received the insolent answer that the French would not discuss the matter of right, but would make prisoners of every Englishman found trading on the Ohio and its waters. The country, he said, belonged to the French, by virtue of the dis coveries of La Salle, and they would not withdraw from it. In January, 1754, Washington returned to Virginia, and made his report to the Governor and Council. Forces were at once raised, and Washington, as Lieutenant Colonel, was dispatched at the head of a hundred and fifty men, to the forks of the Ohio, with orders to \"finish the fort already begun there by the Ohio Company, and to make prisoners, kill or destroy all who interrupted the English settlements.\" On his march through the forests of Western Pennsylvania, Washington, through the aid of friendly Indians, discovered the French concealed among the rocks, and as they ran to seize their arms, ordered his men to fire upon them, at the same time, with his own musket, setting the example. An action lasting about a quarter of an hour ensued; ten of the Frenchmen were killed, among them Jumonville, the commander of the party, and twenty-one were made pris oners. The dead were scalped by the Indians, and the chief, bearing a toma hawk and a scalp, visited all the tribes of the Miamis, urging them to join the Six Nations and the English against the French. The French, however, were soon re-enforced, and Col. Washington was compelled to return to Fort Necessity. Here, on the 3d day of July, De Villiers invested the fort with 600 French troops and l<i0 Indians. On the 4th, Washington accepted terms of capitulation, and the English garrison withdrew from the valley of the Ohio. This attack of Washington upon Jumonville aroused the indignation of France, and war was formally declared in May, 1756, and the \" French and Indian War\" devastated the colonies for several years. Montreal, Detroit and all Canada were surrendered to the English, and on the 10th of February, 1763, by the treaty of Paris \u2014 which had been signed, though not formallv ratified by the respective governments, on the 3d of November, 1762 \u2014 France relinquished to Great Britian all that portion of the province of Louisiana lying on the east side of the Mississippi, except the island and town of New Orleans. On the same day that the treaty of Paris was signed, France, by a secret treaty, ceded to Spain all her possessions on the west side of the Mississippi, including the"], [143, "145 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. whole country to the head waters of the Great River, and west to the Rocky Mountains, and the jurisdiction of France in America, which had lasted nearly a century, was ended. At the close of the Revolutionary war, by the treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States, the English Government ceded to the latter all the territory on the east side of the Mississippi River and north of the thirty first parallel of north latitude. At the same time, Great Britain ceded to Spain all the Floridas, comprising all the territory east of the Mississippi and south of the southern limits of the United States. At this time, therefore, the present State of Iowa was a part of the Spanish possessions in North America, as all the territory west of the Mississippi River was under the dominion of Spain. That government also possessed all the territory of the Floridas east of the great river and south of the thirty-first parallel of north latitude. The Mississippi, therefore, so essential to the pros- perity of the western portion of the United States, for the last three hundred miles of its course flowed wholly within the Spanish dominions, and that govern- ment claimed the exclusive right to use and control it below the southern boun- dary of the United States. The free navigation of the Mississippi was a very important question during all the time that Louisiana remained a dependency of the Spanish Crown, and as the final settlement intimately affected the status of the then future State of Iowa, it will be interesting to trace its progress. The people of the United States occupied and exercised jurisdiction over the entire eastern valley of the Mississippi, embracing all the country drained by its eastern tributaries ; they had a natural right, according to the accepted in- ternational law, to follow these rivers to the sea, and to the use of the Missis- sippi River accordingly, as the great natural channel of commerce. The river was not only necessary but absolutely indispensable to the prosperity and growth of the western settlements then rapidly rising into commercial and political importance. They were situated in the heart of the great valley, and with wonderfully expansive energies and accumulating resources, it was very evident that no power on earth could deprive them of the fiee use of the river below them, only while their numbers were insufficient to enable them to maintain their right by force. Inevitably, therefore, immediately after the ratification of the treaty of 1783, the Western people began to demand the free navigation of the Mississippi \u2014 not as a favor, but as a right. In 1786, both banks of the river, below the mouth of the Ohio, were occupied by Spain, and military posts on the east bank enforced her power to exact heavy duties on all im- ports by way of the river for the Ohio region. Every boat descending the river was forced to land and submit to the arbitrary revenue exactions of the Spanish authorities. Under the administration of Governor Miro, these rigor- ous exactions were somewhat relaxed from 1787 to 1790 ; but Spain held it as her right to make them. Taking advantage of the claim of the American people. that the Mississippi should be opened to them, in 1791, the Spanish Govern ment concocted a scheme for the dismembership of the Union. The plan was to induce the Western people to separate from the Eastern States by liberal land grants and extraordinary commercial privileges. Spanish emissaries, among the people of Ohio and Kentucky, informed them that the Spanish Government would grant them favorable commercial privileges, provided they would secede from the Federal Government east of the mountains. The Spanish Minister to the United States plainly declared to his confidential correspondent that, unless the Western people would declare their independence"], [144, "146 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. and refuse to remain in the Union, Spain was determined never to grant the free navigation of the Mississippi. By the treaty of Madrid, October 20, 1795, however, Spain formally stip ulated that the Mississippi River, from its source to the Gulf, for its entire width, should be free to American trade and commerce, and that the people of the United States should be permitted, for three years, to use the port of New Orleans as a port of deposit for their merchandise and produce, duty free. In November, 1801, the United States Government received, through Rufus King, its Minister at the Court of St. James, a copy of the treaty between Spain and France, signed at Madrid March 21, 1801, by which the cession of Loui siana to France, made the previous Autumn, was confirmed. The change offered a favorable opportunity to secure the just rights of the United States, in relation to the free navigation of the Mississippi, and ended the attempt to dismember the Union by an effort to secure an independent government west of the Alleghany Mountains. On the 7th of January, 1803, the American House of Representatives adopted a resolution declaring their \" unalterable determination to maintain the boundaries and the rights of navi gation and commerce through the River Mississippi, as established by existing treaties.\" In the same month, President Jefferson nominated and the Senate confirmed Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe as Envoys Plenipotentiary to the Court of France, and Charles Pinckney and James Monroe to the Court of Spain, with plenary powers to negotiate treaties to effect the object enunciated by the popular branch of the National Legislature. These envoys were in structed to secure, if possible, the cession of Florida and New Orleans, but it does not appear that Mr. Jefferson and his Cabinet had any idea of purchasing that part of Louisiana lying on the ivest side of the Mississippi. In fact, on the 2d of March following, the instructions were sent to our Ministers, contain ing a plan which expressly left to France \"all her territory on the west side of the Mississippi.\" Had these instructions been followed, it might have been that there would not have been any State of Iowa or any other member of the glori ous Union of States west of the \" Father of Waters.\" In obedience to his instructions, however, Mr. Livingston broached this plan to M. Talleyrand, Napoleon's Prime Minister, when that courtly diplo matist quietly suggested to the American Minister that France might be willing to cede the whole French domain in North America to the United States, and asked how much the Federal Government would be willing to give for it. Liv ingston intimated that twenty millions of francs might be a fair price. Talley rand thought that not enough, but asked the Americans to \"think of it.\" A few days later, Napoleon, in an interview with Mr. Livingston, in effect informed the American Envoy that he had secured Louisiana in a contract with Spain for the purpose of turning it over to the United States for a mere nominal sum. He had been compelled to provide for the safety of that province by the treaty, and he was \" anxious to give the United States a magnificent bargain for a mere trifle.\" The price proposed was one hundred and twenty-five million francs. This was subsequently modified to fifteen million dollars, and on this basis a treaty was negotiated, and was signed on the 30th day of April, 1803. This treaty was ratified by the Federal Government, and by act of Congress, approved October 31, 1803, the President of the United States was authorized to take possession of the territory and provide for it a temporary government. Accordingly, on the 20th day of December following, on behalf of the Presi dent, Gov. Clairborne and Gen. Wilkinson took possession of the Louisiana"], [145, "147 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. purchase, and raised the American flag over the newly acquired domain, at New Orleans. Spain, although it had by treaty ceded the province to France in 1801, still held quasi possession, and at first objected to the transfer, but with drew her opposition early in 1804. By this treaty, thus successfully consummated, and the peaceable withdrawal of Spain, the then infant nation of the New World extended its dominion west of the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean, and north from the Gulf of Mexico to British America. If the original design of Jefferson's administration had been accomplished, the United States would have acquired only that portion of the French territory lying east of the Mississippi River, and while the American people would thus have acquired the free navigation of that great river, all of the vast and fertile empire on the west, so rich in its agricultural and inexhaustible mineral resources, would have remained under the dominion of a foreign power. To Napoleon's desire to sell the whole of his North American possessions, and Liv ingston's act transcending his instructions, which was acquiesced in after it was done, does Iowa owe her position as a part of the United States by the Louisiana purchase. By authority of an act of Congress, approved March 26, 1804, the newly acquired territory was, on the 1st day of October following, divided : that part lying south of the 33d parallel of north latitude was called the Territory of Orleans, and all north of that parallel the District of Louisiana, which was placed under the authority of the officers of Indiana Territory, until July 4, 1805, when it was organized, with territorial government of its own, and so remained until 1812, when the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana, and the name of the Territory of Louisiana was changed to Missouri. On the 4th of July, 1814, that part of Missouri Territory comprising the present State of Arkansas, and the country to the westward, was organized into the Arkansas Territory. On the 2d of March, 1821, the State of Missouri, being a part of the Terri tory of that name, was admitted to the Union. June 28, 1834, the territory west of the Mississippi River and north of Missouri was made a part of the Territory of Michigan ; but two years later, on the 4th of July, 1836, Wiscon sin Territory was erected, embracing within its limits the present States of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota. By act of Congress, approved June 12, 1838, the TERRITORY OF IOWA was erected, comprising, in addition to the present State, much the larger part of Minnesota, and extending north to the boundary of the British Possessions. THE ORIGINAL OWNERS. Having traced the early history of the great empire lying west of the Mis sissippi, of which the State of Iowa constitutes a part, from the earliest dis covery to the organization of the Territory of Iowa, it becomes necessary to give some history of THE INDIANS OF IOWA. According to the policy of the European nations, possession perfected title to any territory. We have seen that the country west of the Mississippi was first discovered by the Spaniards, but afterward, was visited and occupied by the French. It was ceded by France to Spain, and by Spain back to France again,"], [146, "148 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. and then was purchased and occupied by the United States. During all that time, it does not appear to have entered into the heads or hearts of the high contracting parties that the country they bought, sold and gave away was in the possession of a race of men who, although savage, owned the vast domain before Columbus first crossed the Atlantic. Having purchased the territory, the United States found it still in the possession of its original owners, who had never been dispossessed ; and it became necessary to purchase again what had already been bought before, or forcibly eject the occupants ; therefore, the his tory of the Indian nations who occupied Iowa prior to and during its early set tlement by the whites, becomes an important chapter in the history of the State, that cannot be omitted. For more than one hundred years after Marquette and Joliet trod the virgin soil of Iowa, not a single settlement had been made or attempted ; not even a trading post had been established. The whole country remained in the undis puted possession of the native tribes, who roamed at will over her beautiful and fertile prairies, hunted in her woods, fished in her streams, and often poured out their life-blood in obstinately contested contests for supremacy. That this State so aptly styled \"The Beautiful Land,\" had been the theater of numerous, fierce and bloody struggles between rival nations, for possession of the favored region, long before its settlement by civilized man, there is no room for doubt. In these savage wars, the weaker party, whether aggressive or defensive, was either exterminated or driven from their ancient hunting grounds. In 1673, when Marquette discovered Iowa, the Illini were a very powerful people, occupying a large portion of the State ; but when the country was again visited by the whites, not a remnant of that once powerful tribe remained on the west side of the Mississippi, and Iowa was principally in the possession of the Sacs and Foxes, a warlike tribe which, originally two distinct nations, residing in New York and on the waters of the St. Lawrence, had gradually fought their way westward, and united, probably, after the Foxes had been driven out of the Fox River country, in 1846, and crossed the Mississippi. The death of Pontiac, a famous Sac chieftain, was made the pretext for war against the Illini, and a fierce and bloody struggle ensued, which continued until the Illinois were nearly destroyed and their hunting grounds possessed by their victorious foes. The Iowas also occupied a portion of the State for a time, in common with the Sacs, but they, too, were nearly destroyed by the Sacs and Foxes, and, in \"The Beautiful Land,\" these natives met their equally warlike foes, the Northern Sioux, with whom they maintained a constant warfare for the posses sion of the country for many years. When the United States came in possession of the great valley of the Mis sissippi, by the Louisiana purchase, the Sacs and Foxes and Iowas possessed the entire territory now comprising the State of Iowa. The Sacs and Foxes, also, occupied the most of the State of Illinois. The Sacs had four principal villages, where most of them resided, viz. : Their largest and most important town \u2014 if an Indian village may be called such\u2014 and from which emanated most of the obstacles and difficulties encoun tered by the Government in the extinguishment of Indian titles to land in this region, was on Rock River, near Rock Island ; another was on the east bank of the Mississippi, near the mouth of Henderson River ; the third was at the head of the Des Moines Rapids, near the present site of Montrose, and the fourth was near the mouth of the Upper Iowa. The Foxes had three principal villages, viz. : One on the west side of the Mississippi, six miles above the rapids of Rock River ; another about twelve"], [147, "149 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. miles from the river, in the rear of the Dubuque lead mines, and the third on Turkey River. The Iowas, at one time identified with the Sacs, of Rock River, had with drawn from them and become a separate tribe. Their principal village was on the Des Moines River, in Van Buren County, on the site where Iowaville now stands. Here the last great battle between the Sacs and Foxes and the Iowas was fought, in which Black Hawk, then a young man, commanded one division of the attacking forces. The following account of the battle has been given : \" Contrary to long established custom of Indian attack, this battle was commenced in the day time, the attending circumstances justifying this departure from the well settled usages of Indian warfare. The battle field was a level river bottom, about four miles in length, aud two miles wide near the middle, narrowing to a point at either end. The main area of this bottom rises perhaps twenty feet above the river, leaving a narrow strip of low bottom along the shore, covered with trees that belted the prairie on the river side with a thick forest, and the immediate bank of the river was fringed with a dense growth of willows. Near the lower end of this prairie, near the river bank, was s'tuated the Iowa village. About two miles above it and near the middle of the prairie is a mound, covered at the time with a tuft of small trees and underbrush growing on its summit. In the rear of this little elevation or mound lay a belt of wet prairie, covered, at that time, with a dense growth of rank, coarse grass. Bordering this wet prairie on the north, the country rises abruptly into elevated broken river blutfs, covered with a heavy forest for many miles in extent, and in places thickly clustered with undergrowth, affording a convenient shelter for the stealthy approach of the foe. \" Through this sorest the Snc and Fox war party made their way in the night and secreted themselves in the tall grass spoken of above, intending to remain in ambush during the day and make such observations as this near proximity to their intended victim might afford, to aid them in their contemplated attack on the town during the following night. From this situation their spies could take a full survey of the village, and watch every movement of the inhabitants, by which means they were soon convinced that the Iowas had no suspicion of their presence. \" At the foot of the mound above mentioned, the Iowas had their race course, where they diverted themselves with the excitement of horse racing, and schooled their young warriors in cavalry evolutions. In these exercises mock battles were fought, and the Indian tactics of attack and defense carefully inculcated, by which means a skill in horsemanship was acquired rarely excelled. Unfortunately for them this day was selected for their equestrian sports, and wholly uncon- scious of the proximity of their foes, the warriors repaired to the race ground, leaving most of their arms in the village and their old men and women and children unprotected. \" Pash-a-po-po, who was chief in command of the Sacs and Foxes, perceived at once the advantage this state of things afforded for a complete surprise of his now doomed victims, and ordered Black Hawk to file off with his young warriors through the tall grass and gain the cover of the timber along the river bank, and with the utmost speed reach the village and commence the battle, while he regained with his division in the ambush to make a simultaneous as-auk on the unarmed men whose attention was engrossed with the excitement of the races. Tlie plan was skillfully laid and most dexterously executed. Black Hawk with his forces reached the village undi-covered, and made a furious onslaught upon the defenseless inhabiiants, by firing one general volley into their midst, and completing the slaughter with the tomahawk an 1 scalp- ing knife, aided by the devouring flames with which they enveloped the village as suOa as the fire brand could be spread from lodge to lodge. \" On the instant ot the report of fire arms at the village, the forces under Pash-i-po-po leaped from their couchant position in the grass and sprang tiger-like upon the astonished and unarmed Iowas in the midst of their racing sports. The first impulse of the latter natuially led them to make the utmost speed toward their arms in thj village, and protect if poss.ble their wives and ch.l Iren from the attack of their merciless assailants. The distance from the plica of attack on the prairie was two miles, and a great number fell in their flight by the bullets and tomahawks of their enemies, who pressed them closely with a running fire the whole way. and the survivors only reached their town in time to witness the horrors of its destruction. Their whole village was in fl.imes, and the dearest objects of their lives lay in slaughter d heaps amidst the devouring elem.-nf, an 1 the agonizing groans of the dying, minglel with ih \u25a0 exi tina shouts of the victorious foe, fille 1 their he uts with maddening despair. Their wives an 1 children who had been spared the general massacre were prisoners, and together with their arms were in the hands of the victors; and all that could now be done was to draw off their shattered and defenseless forces, and save as many lives as possible by a retreat across the Des Moines River, which they effected in the best possible manner, and toot a position among the Soap Creek Hills.\" The Sacs and Foxes, prior to the settlement of their village on Rock River, had a fierce conflict with the Winnebagoes, subdued them and took Dossession"], [148, "150 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. of their lands. Their village on Rock River, at one time, contained upward of sixty lodges, and was among the largest Indian villages on the continent. In 1825, the Secretary of War estimated the entire number of the Sacs and Foxes at 4,600 souls. Their village was situated in the immediate vicinity of the upper rapids of the Mississippi, where the beautiful and flourishing towns of Rock Island and Davenport are now situated. The beautiful scenery of the island, the extensive prairies, dotted over with groves ; the picturesque bluffs along the river banks, the rich and fertile soil, producing large crops of corn, squash and other vegetables, with little labor; the abundance of wild fruit, game, fish, and almost everything calculated to make it a delightful spot for an Indian village, which was found there, had made this place a favorite home of the Sacs, and secured for it the strong attachment and veneration of the whole nation. North of the hunting grounds of the Sacs and Foxes, were those of the Sioux, a fierce and warlike nation, who often disputed possession with their rivals in savage and bloody warfare. The possessions of these tribes were mostly located in Minnesota, but extended over a portion of Northern and Western Iowa to the Missouri River. Their descent from the north upon the hunting grounds of Iowa frequently brought them into collision with the Sacs and Foxes ; and after many a conflict and bloody struggle, a boundary line was established between them by the Government of the United States, in a treaty held at Prairie du Chien, in 1825. But this, instead of settling the difficulties, caused them to quarrel all the more, in consequence of alleged trespasses upon each other's side of the line. These contests were kept up and became so unre lenting that, in 1830, Government bought of the respective tribes of the Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux, a strip of land twenty miles in width, on both sides of the lino, and thus throwing them forty miles apart by creating between them a \"neutral ground,\" commanded them to cease their hostilities. Both the Sacs and Foxes and the Sioux, however, were allowed to fish and hunt on this ground unmolested, provided they did not interfere with each other on United States territory. The Sacs and Poxes and the Sioux were deadly enemies, and neither let an opportunity to punish the other pass unimproved. In April, 1852, a fight occurred between the Musquaka band of Sacs and Foxes and a band of Sioux, about six miles above Algona, in Kossuth County, on the west side of the Des Moines River. The Sacs and Foxes were under the leadership of Ko-ko-wah, a subordinate chief, and had gone up from their home in Tama County, by way of Clear Lake, to what was then the \"neutral ground.\" At Clear Lake, Ko-ko-wah was informed that a party of Sioux were encamped on the west side of the East Fork of the Des Moines, and he deter mined to attack them. With sixty of 'his warriors, he started and arrived at a point on the east side of the river, about a mile above the Sioux encampment, in the night, and concealed themselves in a grove, where they were able to dis cover the position and strength of their hereditary foes. The next morning, after many of the Sioux braves had left their camp on hunting tours, the vin dictive Sacs and Foxes crossed the river and suddenly attacked the camp. The conflict was desperate for a short time, but the advantage was with the assail ants, and the Sioux were routed. Sixteen of them, including some of their women and children, were killed, and a boy 14 years old was captured. One of the Musquakas was shot in the breast by a squaw as they were rushing into the Sioux's camp. He started to run away, when the same brave squaw shot him through the body, at a distance of twenty rods, and he fell dead. Three other Sac braves were killed. But few of the Sioux escaped. The victorious"], [149, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 151 party hurriedly buried their own dead, leaving the dead Sioux above ground, and made their way home, with their captive, with all possible expedition. PIKE'S EXPEDITION. Very soon after the acquisition of Louisiana, the United States Government adopted measures for the exploration of the new territory, having in view the conciliation of the numerous tribes of Indians by whom it was possessed, and, also, the selection of proper sites for the establishment of military posts and trading stations. The Army of the West, Gen. James Wilkinson commanding. had its headquarters at St. Louis. From this post, Captains Lewis and Clark, with a sufficient force, were detailed to explore the unknown sources of the Missouri, and Lieut. Zebulon M. Pike to ascend to the head waters of the Mis sissippi. Lieut. Pike, with one Sergeant, two Corporals and seventeen privates, left the military camp, near St. Louis, in a keel-boat, with four months' rations. on the 9th day of August, 1805. On the 20th of the same month, the expe dition arrived within the present limits of Iowa, at the foot of the Des Moines Rapids, where Pike met William Ewing, who had just been appointed Indian Agent at this point, a French interpreter and four chiefs and fifteen Sac and Fox warriors. At the head of the Rapids, where Montrose is now situated, Pike held a council with the Indians, in which he addressed them substantially as follows : \" Your great Father, the President of the United States, wished to be more intimately acquainted with the situation and wants of the different nations of red people in our newlv acquired territory of Louisiana, and has ordered the General to send a number of his warriors in different directions to take them by the hand and make such inquiries as might afford the satisfaction required.\" At the close of the council he presented the red men with some knives, whisky and tobacco. Pursuing his way up the river, he arrived, on the 23d of August, at what is supposed, from his description, to be the site of the present city of Burlington, which he selected as the location of a military post. He describes the place as being \" on a hill, about forty miles above the River de Moyne Rapids, on the west side of the river, in latitude about 41\u00b0 21' north. The channel of the river runs on that shore; the hill in front is about sixty feet perpendicular; nearly level on top ; four hundred yards in the rear is a small prairie fit for gardening, and immediately under the hill is a limestone spring, sufficient for the consumption of a whole regiment.\" In addition to this description, which corresponds to Burlington, the spot is laid down on his map at a bend in the river, a short distance below tbe mouth of the Henderson, which pours its waters into the Mississippi from Illinois. The fort was built at Fort Madison, but from the distance, latitude, description and map furnished by Pike, it could not have been the place selected by him, while all the circumstances corroborate the opinion that the place he selected was the spot where Burlington is now located, called by the early voyagers on the Mississippi, \"Flint Hills.\" On the 24th, with one of his men, he went on shore on a hunting expedition, and following a stream which they supposed to be a part of the Mississippi, they were led away from their course. Owing to the intense heat and tall grass, his two favorite dogs, which he had taken with him, became exhausted and he left them on the prairie, supposing that they would follow him as soon as they should get rested, and went on to overtake his boat. Reaching the river, he waited some time for his canine friends, but they did not come, and as he deemed it inexpedieut to detain the boat longer, two of his men volunteered to go in pur-"], [150, "152 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. suit of them, and he continued on his way up the river, expecting that the two men would soon overtake him. They lost their way, however, and for six days were without food, except a few morsels gathered from the stream, and might have perished, had they not accidentally met a trader from St. Louis, who in duced two Indians to take them up the river, and they overtook the boat at Dubuque. At Dubuque, Pike was cordially received by Julien Dubuque, a Frenchman, who held a mining claim under a grant from Spain. Dubuque had an old field piece and fired a salute in honor of the advent of the first Americans who had visited that part of the Territory. Dubuque, however, was not disposed to pub lish the wealth of his mines, and the young and evidently inquisitive officer obtained but little information from him. After leaving this place, Pike pursued his way up the river, but as he passed beyond the limits of the present State of Iowa, a detailed history of his explo rations on the upper waters of the Mississippi more properly belongs to the his tory of another State. It is sufficient to say that on the site of Fort Snelling, Minnesota, at the mouth of the Minnesota River, Pike held a council with the Sioux, September 23, and obtained from them a grant of one hundred thousand acres of land. On the 8th of January, 1806, Pike arrived at a trading post belonging to the Northwest Company, on Lake De Sable, in latitude 47\u00b0. At this time the then powerful Northwest Company carried on their immense operations from Hudson's Bay to the St. Lawrence; up that river on both sides, along the great lakes to the head of Lake Superior, thence to the sources of the Red River of the north and west, to the Rocky Mountains, embracing within the scope of their operations the entire Territory of Iowa. After successfully accomplishing his mission, and performing a valuable service to Iowa and the whole Northwest, Pike returned to St. Louis, arriving there on the 30th of April, 1806. INDIAN WARS. The Territory of Iowa, although it had been purchased by the United States, and was ostensibly in the possession of the Government, was still occupied by the Indians, who claimed title to the soil by right of ownership and possession. Before it could be open to settlement by the whites, it was indispensable that the Indian title should be extinguished and the original owners removed. The accomplishment of this purpose required the expenditure of large sums of money and blood, and for a long series of years the frontier was disturbed by Indian wars, terminated repeatedly by treaty, only to be renewed by some act of oppression on the part of the whites or some violation of treaty stipulation. As previously shown, at the time when the United States assumed the con trol of the country by virtue of the Louisiana purchase, nearly the whole State was in possession of the Sacs and Foxes, a powerful and warlike nation, who were not disposed to submit without a struggle to what they considered the encroachments of the pale faces. Among the most noted chiefs, and one whose restlessness and hatred of the Americans occasioned more trouble to the Government than any other of his tribe, was Black Hawk, who was born at the Sac village, on Rock River, in 1767. He was simply the chief of his own band of Sac warriors, but by his energy and ambition he became the leading spirit of the united nation of Sacs and Foxes, and one of the prominent figures in the history of the country from 1804 until his death. In early manhood he attained some distinction as a fighting chief, having led campaigns against the Osagcs, and other neighboring"], [151, "153 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. tribes. About the beginning of the present century he began to appear prom inent in affairs on the Mississippi. Some historians have added to the statement that \" it does not appear that he was ever a great general, or possessed any of the qualifications of a successful leader.\" If this was so, his life was a marvel. How any man who had none of the qualifications of a leader became so prom inent as such, as he did, indicates either that he had some ability, or that his cotemporaries, both Indian and Anglo-Saxon, had less than he. He is said to have been the \"victim of a narrow prejudice and bitter ill-will against the Americans,\" but the impartial historian must admit that if he was the enemy of theAmericans, it was certainly not without some reason. It will be remembered that Spain did not give up possession of the country to France on its cession to the latter power, in 1801, but retained possession of it, and, by the authority of France, transferred it to the United States, in 1804. Black Hawk and his band were in St. Louis at the time, and were invited to be present and witness the ceremonies of the transfer, but he refused the invitation, and it is but just to say that this refusal was caused probably more from regret that the Indians were to be transferred from the jurisdiction of the Spanish authorities than from any special hatred toward the Americans. In his life he says : \" I found many sad and gloomy faces because the United States were about to take possession of the town and country. Soon after the Americans came, I took my band and went to take leave of our Spanish father. The Americans came to see him also. Seeing them approach, we passed out of one door as they entered another, and immediately started in our canoes for our village, on Rock River, not liking the change any more than our friends appeared to at St. Louis. On arriving at our village, we gave the news that strange people had arrived at St. Louis, and that we should never see our Spanish father again. The information made all our people sorry.\" On the 3d day of November, 1804, a treaty was concluded between William Henry Harrison, then Governor of Indiana Territory, on behalf of the United States, and five chiefs of the Sac and Fox nation, by which the latter, in con- sideration of two thousand two hundred and thirty-four dollars' worth of goods then delivered, and a yearly annuity of one thousand dollars to be paid in goods at just cost, ceded to the United States all that land on the east side of the Mississppi, extending from a point opposite the Jefferson, in Missouri, to the Wisconsin River, embracing an area of over fifty-one millions of acres. To this treaty Black Hawk always objected and always refused to consider it binding upon his people. He asserted that the chiefs or braves who made it had no authority to relinquish the title of the nation to any of the lands they held or occupied ; and, moreover, that they had been sent to St. Louis on quite a different errand, namely, to get one of their people released, who had been imprisoned at St. Louis for killing a white man. The year following this treaty (1805), Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike came up the river for the purpose of holding friendly councils with the Indians and select ing sites for forts within the territory recently acquired from France by the United States. Lieutenant Pike seems to have been the first American whom Black Hawk ever met or had a personal interview with ; and he was very much prepossessed in Pike's favor. He gives the following account of his visit to Rock Island : \" A boat came up the river with a young American chief and a small party of soldiers. We heard of them soon after they passed Salt River. Some of our young braves watched them every day, to see what sort of people he had on board. The boat at length arrived at Rock River, and the young chief came on"], [152, "154 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. shore with his interpreter, and made a speech and gave us some presents. We in turn presented them with meat and such other provisions as we had to spare. We were well pleased with the young chief. He gave us good advice, and said our American father would treat us well.\" The events which soon followed Pike's expedition were the erection of Fort Edwards, at what is now Warsaw, Illinois, and Fort Madison, on the site of the present town of that name, the latter being the first fort erected in Iowa. These movements occasioned great uneasiness among the Indians. When work was commenced on Fort Edwards, a delegation from their nation, headed by some of their chiefs, went down to see what the Americans were doing, and had an in terview with the commander; after which they returned home apparently satis fied. In like manner, when Fort Madison was being erected, they sent down another delegation from a council of the nation held at Rock River. Accord ing to Black Hawk's account, the American chief told them that he was build ing a house for a trader who was coming to sell them goods cheap, and that the soldiers were coming to keep him company \u2014 a statement which Black Hawk says they distrusted at the time, believing that the fort was an encroachment upon their rights, and designed to aid in getting their lands away from them. It has been held by good American authorities, that the erection of Fort Madison at the point where it was located was a violation of the treaty of 1804. By the eleventh article of that treaty, the United States had a right to build a fort near the mouth of the Wisconsin River ; by article six they had bound themselves \"that if any citizen of the United States or any other white persons should form a settlement upon their lands, such intruders should forthwith be removed.\" Probably the authorities of the United States did not regard the establishment of military posts as coming properly within the meaning of the term \"settlement,\" as used in the treaty. At all events, they erected Fort Madison within the territory reserved to the Indians, who became very indig nant. Not long after the fort was built, a party led by Black Hawk attempted its destruction. They sent spies to watch the movements of the garrison, who ascertained that the soldiers were in the habit of marching out of the fort every morning and evening for parade, and the plan of the party was to conceal them selves near the fort, and attack and surprise them when they were outside. On the morning of the proposed day of attack, five soldiers came out and were fired upon by the Indians, two of them being killed. The Indians were too hasty in their movement, for the regular drill had not yet commenced. However, they kept up the attack for several days, attempting the old Fox strategy of setting fire to the fort with blazing arrows ; but finding their efforts unavailing, they soon gave up and returned to Rock River. When war was declared between the United States and Great Britain, in 1812, Black Hawk and his band allied themselves with the British, partly because he was dazzled by their specious promises, and more probably because they had been deceived by the Americans. Black Hawk himself declared that they were \"forced into the war by being deceived.\" He narrates the circum stances as follows : \" Several of the chiefs and head men of the Sacs and Foxes were called upon to go to Washington to see their Great Father. On their return, they related what had been said and done. They said the Great Father wished them, in the event of a war taking place with England, not to interfere on either side, but to remain neutral. He did not want our help, but wished us to hunt and support our families, and live in peace. He said that British traders would not be permitted to come on the Mississippi to furnish us with good*, but that we should be supplied with an American trader. Our"], [153, "155 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. chiefs then told him that the British traders always gave them credit in the Fall for guns, powder and goods, to enable us to hunt and clothe our families. He repeated that the traders at Fort Madison would have plenty of goods ; that we should go there in the Fall and he would supply us on credit, as the British traders had done.\" Black Hawk seems to have accepted of this proposition, and he and his people were very much pleased. Acting in good faith, they fitted out for their Winter's hunt, and went to Fort Madison in high spirits to receive from the trader their outfit of supplies. But, after waiting some time, they were told by the trader that he would not trust them. It was in vain that they pleaded the promise of their great father at Washington. The trader was inexorable ; and, disappointed and crestfallen, they turned sadly toward their own village. \"Few of us,\" says Black Hawk, \"slept that night; all was gloom and discontent. In the morning, a canoe was seen ascending the river ; it soon arrived, bearing an express, who brought intelligence that a British trader had landed at Rock Island with two boats loaded with goods, and requested us to come up imme diately, because he had good news for us, and a variety of presents. The express presented us with tobacco, pipes and wampum. The news ran through our camp like fire on a prairie. Our lodges were soon taken down, and all started for Rock Island. Here ended all hopes of our remaining at peace, having been forced into the war by being deceived.\" He joined the British, who flattered him, styled him \" Gen. Black Hawk,\" decked him with medals, excited his jealousies against the Americans, and armed his band ; but he met with defeat and disappointment, and sjon aban doned the service and came home. With all his skill and courage, Black Hawk was unable to lead all the Sacs and Foxes into hostilities to the United States. A portion of them, at the head of whom was Keokuk (\"the Watchful Fox\"), were disposed to abide by the treaty of 1804, and to cultivate friendly relations with the American people. Therefore, when Black Hawk and his band joined the fortunes of Great Britain, the rest of the nation remained neutral, and, for protection, organized, with Keokuk for their chief. This divided the nation into the \" War and the Peace party.\" Black Hawk says he was informed, after he had gone to the war, that the nation, which had been reduced to so small a body of fighting men, were unable to defend themselves in case the Americans should attack them, and having all the old men and women and children belonging to the warriors who had joined the British on their hands to provide for, a council was held, and it was agreed that Quash-qua-me (the Lance) and other chiefs, together with the old men, women and children, and such others as chose to accompany them, should go to St. Louis and place themselves under the American chief stationed there. They accordingly went down, and were received as the \" friendly band \" of the Sacs and Foxes, and were provided for and sent up the Missouri River. On Black Hawk's return from the British army, he says Keokuk was introduced to him as the war chief of the braves then in the village. He inquired how he had become chief, and was informed that their spies had seen a large armed force going toward Peoria, and fears were entertained of an attack upon the village ; whereupon a council was held, which concluded to leave the village and cross over to the west side of the Mississippi. Keokuk had been standing at the door of the lodge where the council was held, not being allowed to enter on account of never having killed an enemy, where he remained until Wa-co-me came out. Keokuk asked permission to speak in the council, which Wa-co-me"], [154, "156 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. obtained for him. Keokuk then addressed the chiefs ; he remonstrated against the desertion of their village, their own homes and the graves of their fathers, and offered to defend the village. The council consented that he should be their war chief. He marshaled his braves, sent out spies, and advanced on the trail leading to Peoria, but returned without seeing the enemy. The Americans did not disturb the village, and all were satisfied with the appointment of Keokuk. Keokuk, like Black Hawk, was a descendant of the Sac branch of the nation, and was born on Rock River, in 1780. He was of a pacific disposition, but possessed the elements of true courage, and could fight, when occasion required, with a cool judgment and heroic energy. In his first battle, he en countered and killed a Sioux, which placed him in the rank of warriors, and he was honored with a public feast by his tribe in commemoration of the event. Keokuk has been described as an orator, entitled to rank with the most gifted of his race. In person, he was tall and of portly bearing ; in his public speeches, he displayed a commanding attitude and graceful gestures ; he spoke rapidly, but his enunciation was clear, distinct and forcible ; he culled his fig ures from the stores of nature and based his arguments on skillful logic. Un fortunately for the reputation of Keokuk, as an orator among white people, he was never able to obtain an interpreter who could claim even a slight acquaint ance with philosophy. With one exception only, his interpreters were unac quainted with the elements of their mother-tongue. Of this serious hindrance to his fame, Keokuk was well aware, and retained Frank Labershure, who had received a rudimental education in the French and English languages, until the latter broke down by dissipation and died. But during the meridian of his career among the white people, he was compelled to submit his speeches for translation to uneducated men, whose range of thought fell below the flights of a gifted mind, and the fine imagery drawn from nature was beyond their power of reproduction. He had sufficient knowledge of the English language to make him sensible of this bad rendering of his thoughts, and often a feeling of morti fication at the bungling efforts was depicted on his countenance while speaking. The proper place to form a correct estimate of his ability as an orator was in the Indian council, where he addressed himself exclusively to those who under stood his language, and witness the electrical effect of his eloquence upon his audience. Keokuk seems to have possessed a more sober judgment, and to have had a more intelligent view of the great strength and resources of the United States, than his noted and restless cotemporary, Black Hawk. He knew from the first that the reckless war which Black Hawk and his band had determined to carry on could result in nothing but defeat and disaster, and used every argument against it. The large number of warriors whom he had dissuaded from following Black Hawk became, however, greatly excited with the war spirit after Stillman's defeat, and but for the signal tact displayed by Keokuk on that occasion, would have forced him to submit to their wishes in joining the rest of the warriors in the field. A war-dance was held, and Keokuk took part in it, seeming to be moved with the current of the rising storm. When the dance was over, he called the council to prepare for war. He made a speech, in which he admitted the justice of their complaints against the Americans. To seek redress was a noble aspiration of their nature. The blood of their brethren had been shed by the white man, and the spirits of their braves, slain in battle, called loudly for vengeance. \"I am your chief,\" he said, \"and it is my duty to lead you to' bat tle, if, after fully considering the matter, you are determined to go. But before"], [155, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 157 you decide on taking this important step, it is wise to inquire into the chances of success.\" He then portrayed to them the great power of the United States, against whom they would have to contend, that their chance of success was utterly hopeless. \" But,\" said he, \" if you do determine to go upon the war path, I will agree to lead you, on one condition, viz.: that before we go, we will kill all our old men and our wives and children, to save them from a lingering death of starvation, and that every one of us determine to leave our homes on the other side of the Mississippi.\" This was a strong but truthful picture of the prospect before them, and was presented in such a forcible light as to cool their ardor, and cause them to aban don the rash undertaking. But during the war of 1832, it is now considered certain that small bands of Indians, from the west side of the Mississippi, made incursions into the white settlements, in the lead mining region, and committed some murders and dep redations. When peace was declared between the United States and England, Black Hawk was required to make peace with the former, and entered into a treaty at Portage des Sioux, September 14, 1815, but did not \" touch the goose-quill to it until May 13, 1816, when he smoked the pipe of peace with the great white chief,\" at St. Louis. This treaty was a renewal of the treaty of 1804, but Black Hawk declared he had been deceived ; that he did not know that by signing the treaty he was giving away his village. This weighed upon his mind, already soured by previous disappointment and the irresistible encroachments of the whites ; and when, a few years later, he and his people were driven from their possessions by the military, he determined to return to the home of his fathers. It is also to be remarked that, in 1816, by treaty with various tribes, the United States relinquished to the Indians all the lands lying north of a line drawn from the southernmost point of Lake Michigan west to the Mississippi, except a reservation five leagues square, on the Mississippi River, supposed then to be sufficient to include all the mineral lands on and adjacent to Fever River, and one league square at the mouth of the Wisconsin River. THE BLACK HAWK WAR. The immediate cause of the Indian outbreak in 1830 was the occupation of Black Hawk's village, on the Rock River, by the whites, during the absence of tbe chief and his braves on a hunting expedition, on the west side of the Mississippi. When they returned, they found their wigwams occupied by white families, and their own women and children were shelterless on the banks of the river. The Indians were indignant, and determined to repossess their villace at all hazards, and early in the Spring of 1831 recrossed the Mississippi and menacingly took possession of their own cornfields and cabins. It may be well to remark here that it was expressly stipulated in the treaty of 1804, to which they attributed all their troubles, that the Indians should not be obliged to leave their lands until they were sold by the United States, and it doas not appear that they occupied any lands other than those owned by the Government. If this was true, the Indians had good cause for indignation and complaint. But the whites, driven out in turn by the returning Indians, became so clamorous against what they termed the encroachments of the natives, that Gov. Reynolds, of Illinois, ordered Gen Gaines to Rock Island with a military force to drive the Indians again from their homes to the west side of the Mississippi. Black Hawk says he did not intend to be provoked into war by anything less than the blood of"], [156, "158 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. some of his own people ; in other words, that there would be no war unless it should be commenced by the pale faces. But it was said and probably thought by the mili tary commanders along the frontier that the Indians intended to unite in a general war against the whites, from Rock River to the Mexican borders. But it does not appear that the hardy frontiersmen themselves had any fears, for their experi ence had been that, when well treated, their Indian neighbors were not danger ous. Black Hawk and his band had done no more than to attempt to repossess the the old homes of which they had been deprived in their absence. No blood had been shed. Black Hawk and his chiefs sent a flag of truce, and a new treaty was made, by which Black Hawk and his band agreed to remain forever on the Iowa side and never recross the river without the permission of the President or the Governor of Illinois. Whether the Indians clearly understood the terms of this treaty is uncertain. As was usual, the Indian traders had dictated terms on their behalf, and they had received a large amount of pro visions, etc., from the Government, but it may well be doubted whether the Indians comprehended that they could never revisit the graves of their fathers without violating their treaty. They undoubtedly thought that they had agreed never to recross the Mississippi with hostile intent. However this may be, on the 6th day of April, 1832, Black Hawk and his entire band, with their women and children, again recrossed the Mississippi in plain view of the garrison of Fort Armstrong, and went up Rock River. Although this act was construed into an act of hostility by the military authorities, who declared that Black Hawk intended to recover his village, or the site where it stood, by force ; but it does not appear that he made any such attempt, nor did his apearance create any special alarm among the settlers. They knew that the Indians never went on the war path encumbered with the old men, their women and their children. The Galenian, printed in Galena, of May 2, 1832, says that Black Hawk was invited by the Prophet and had taken possession of a tract about forty miles up Rock River ; but that he did not remain there long, but commenced his march up Rock River. Capt. W. B. Green, who served in Capt. Stephen son's company of mounted rangers, says that \" Black Hawk and Irs band crossed the river with no hostile intent, but that his band had had bad luck in hunting during the previous Winter, were actually in a starving condition, and had come over to spend the Summer with a friendly tribe on the head waters of the Rock and Illinois Rivers, by invitation from their chief. Other old set tlers, who all agree that Black Hawk had no idea of fighting, say that he came back to the west side expecting to negotiate another treaty, and get a new supply of provisions. The most reasonable explanation of this movement, which resulted so disastrously to Black Hawk and his starving people, is that, during the Fall and Winter of 1831-2, his people became deeply indebted to their favorite trader at Fort Armstrong (Rock Island). They had not been fortunate in hunting, and he was likely to lose heavily, as an Indian debt was outlawed in one year. If, therefore, the Indians could be induced to come over, and the fears of the military could be sufficiently aroused to pursue them, another treaty could be negotiated, and from the payments from the Government the shrewd trader could get his pay. Just a week after Black Hawk crossed the river, on the 13th of April, 1832, George Davenport wrote to Gen. Atkinson : \"lam informed that the British band of Sac Indians are determined to make war on the frontier settlements. * * * From every information that I have received, I am of the opinion that the intention of the British band of Sac Indians is to commit depredations on the inhabitants of the frontier.\" And"], [157, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 159 yet, from the 6th day of April until after Stillman's men commenced war by firing on a flag of truce from Black Hawk, no murders nor depredations were committed by the British band of Sac Indians. It is not the purpose of this sketch to detail the incidents of the Black Hawk war of 1832, as it pertains rather to the history of the State of Illinois. It is sufficient to say that, after the disgraceful affair at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk, concluding that the whites, refusing to treat with him, were determined to exterminate his people, determined to return to the Iowa side of the Missis sippi. He could not return by the way he came, for the army was behind him, an army, too, that would sternly refuse to recognize the white flag of peace. His only course was to make his way northward and reach the Mississippi, if possible, before the troops could overtake him, and this he did ; but, before he could get his women anil children across the Wisconsin, he was overtaken, and a battle ensued. Here, again, he sued for peace, and, through his trusty Lieu tenant, \"the Prophet,\" the whites were plainly informed that the starving Indians did not wish to fight, but would return to the west side of the Missis sippi, peaceably, if they could be permitted to do so. No attention was paid to this second effort to negotiate peace, and, as soon as supplies could be obtained, the pursuit was resumed, the flying Indians were overtaken again eight miles before they reached the mouth of the Bad Axe, and the slaughter (it should not be dignified by the name of battle) commenced. Here, overcome by starvation and the victorious whites, his band was scattered, on the 2d day of August, 1832. Black Hawk escaped, but was brought into camp at Prairie du Chien by three Winnebagoes. He was confined in Jefferson Barracks until the Spring of 1833, when he was sent to Washington, arriving there April 22. On the 26th of April, they were taken to Fortress Monroe, where they remained till the 4th of June, 1833, when orders were given for them to be liberated and returned to their own country. By order of the President, he was brought back to Iowa through the principal Eastern cities. Crowds flocked to see him all along his route, and he was very much flattered by the attentions he received. He lived among his people on the Iowa River till that reservation was sold, in 1836, when, with the rest of the Sacs and Foxes, he removed to the Des Moines Reservation, where he remained till his death, which occurred on the 3d of October, 1838. INDIAN PURCHASES, RESERVES AND TREATIES. At the close of the Black Hawk War, in 1832, a treaty was made at a council held on the west bank of the Mississippi, where now stands the thriving city of Davenport, on grounds now occupied by the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Company, on the 21st day of September, 1832. At this council, the United States were represented by Gen. Winfield Scott and Gov. Reynolds, of Illinois. Keokuk, Pash-a-pa-ho and some thirty other chiefs and warriors of the Sac and Fox nation were present. By this treaty, the Sacs and Foxes ceded to the United States a strip of land on the eastern border of Iowa fifty miles wide, from the northern boundary of Missouri to the mouth of the Upper Iowa River, containing about six million acres. The western line of the purchase was parallel with the Mississippi. In consideration of this cession, the United States Government stipulated to pay annually to the confederated tribes, for thirty consecutive years, twenty thousand dollars in specie, and to pay the debts of the Indians at Rock Island, which had been accumulating for"], [158, "160 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. seventeen years and amounted to fifty thousand dollars, due to Davenport & Farnham, Indian traders. The Government also generously donated to the Sac and Fox women and children whose husbands and fathers had fallen in the Black Hawk war, thirty-five beef cattle, twelve bushels of salt, thirty barrels of pork, fifty barrels of flour and six thousand bushels of corn. This territory is known as the \"Black Hawk Purchase.\" Although it was not the first portion of Iowa ceded to the United States by the Sacs and Foxes, it was the first opened to actual settlement by the tide of emigration that flowed across the Mississippi as soon as the Indian title was extinguished. The treaty was ratified February 13, 1833, and took effect on the 1st of June following, when the Indians quietly removed from the ceded territory-, and this fertile and beautiful region was opened to white settlers. By the terms of the treaty, out of the Black Hawk Purchase was reserved for the Sacs and Foxes 400 square miles of land situated on the Iowa River, and in lcuding within its limits Keokuk's village, on the right bank of that river. This tract was known as \" Keokuk's Reserve^ ' and was occupied by the Indians until 1836, when, by a treaty made in September between them and Gov. Dodge, of Wisconsin Territory, it was ceded to the United States. The council was held on the banks of the Mississippi, above Davenport, and was the largest assem blage of the kind ever held by the Sacs and Foxes to treat for the sale of lands. About one thousand of their chiefs and braves were present, and Keokuk was their leading spirit and principal speaker on the occasion. By the terms of the treaty, the Sacs and Foxes were removed to another reservation on the Des Moines River, where an agency was established for them at what is now the town of Agency City. Besides the Keokuk Reserve, the Government gave out of the Black Hawk Purchase to Antoine Le Claire, interpreter, in fee simple, one section of land opposite Rock Island, and another at the head of the first rapids above the island, on the Iowa side. This was the first land title granted by the United States to an individual in Iowa. Soon after the removal of the Sacs and Foxes to their new reservation on the Des Moines River, Gen. Joseph M. Street was transferred from the agency of the Winnebagoes, at Prairie du Chien, to establish an agency among them. A farm was selected, on which the necessary buildings were erected, including a comfortable farm house for the agent and his family, at the expense of the Indian Fund. A salaried agent was employed to superin tend the farm and dispose of the crops. Two mills were erected, one on Soap Creek and the other on Sugar Creek. The latter was soon swept away by a flood, but the former remained and did good service for many years. Connected with the agency were Joseph Smart and John Goodell, interpreters. The latter was interpreter for Hard Fish's band. Three of the Indian chiefs, Keo kuk, Wapello and Appanoose, had each a large field improved, the two former on the right bank of the Des Moines, back from the river, in what is now \" Keokuk's Prairie,\" and the latter on the present site of the city of Ottumwa. Among the traders connected with the agency were the Messrs. Ewino-, from Ohio, and Phelps & Co., from Illinois, and also Mr. J. P. Eddy, whcT estab lished his post at what is now the site of Eddyville. The Indians at this agency became idle and listless in the absence of their natural and wonted excitements, and many of them plunged into dissipation. Keokuk himself became dissipated in the latter years of his life, and it has been reported that he died of delirium tremens after his removal with his tribe to Kansas."], [159, "161 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. In May, 1843, most of the Indians were removed up the Des Moines River, above the temporary line of Red Rock, having ceded the remnant of their lands in Iowa to the United States on the 21st of September, 1837, and on the 11th of October, 1842. By the terms of the latter treaty, they held possession of the \"New Purchase\" till the Autumn of 1845, when the most of them were removed to their reservation in Kansas, the balance being removed in the Spring of 1846. 1. Treaty with the Sioux\u2014 Made July 19, 1815; ratified December 16, 1815. This treaty was made at Portage des Sioux, between the Sioux of Minnesota and Upper Iowa and the United States, by William Clark and Ninian Edwards, Commissioners, and was merely a treaty of peace and friendship on the part of those Indians toward the United States at the close of the war of 1812. 2. Treaty with the Sacs. \u2014 A similar treaty of peace was made at Portage des Sioux, between the United States and the Sacs, by William Clark, Ninian Edwards and Auguste Choteau, on the loth of September, 1815, and ratified at the same date as the above. In this, the treaty of 1804 was re-affirmed, and the Sacs here represented promised for themselves and their bands to keep entirely separate from the Sacs of Rock Paver, who, under Black Hawk, had joined the British in the war just then closed. 3 . Treaty with the Foxes. \u2014 A separate treaty of peace was made with the Foxes at Portage des Sioux, by the same Commissioners, on the 14th of September, 1815, and ratified the same as the above, wherein the Foxes re-affirmed the treaty of St. Louis, of November 3, 1804, and agreed to deliver up all their prisoners to the officer in command at Fort Clark, now Peoria, Illinois. 4. Treaty with the Iowas. \u2014 A treaty of peace and mutual good will was made between the United States and the Iowa tribe of Indians, at Portage des Sioux, by the same Commissioners as above, on the 16th of September, 1815, at the close of the war with Great Britain, and ratified at the same date as the others. 5. Treaty with the Sacs of Rock River \u2014 Made at St. Louis on the 13th of May, 1816, between the United States and the Sacs of Rock River, by the Commissioners, William Clark, Ninian Edwards and Auguste Choteau, and ratified December 30, 1816. In this treaty, that of 1804 was reestablished and confirmed by twenty-two chiefs and head men of the Sacs of Rock River, and Black Hawk himself attached to it his signature, or, as he said, \"touched the goose quill.\" 6. Treaty of 1S2A \u2014 On the 4th of August, 1824, a treaty was made between the United States and the Sacs and Foxes, in the city of Washington, by William Clark, Commissioner, wherein the Sac and Fox nation relinquished their title to all lands in Missouri and that portion of the southeast corner of Iowa known as the \" Half-Breed Tract\" was set off and reserved for the use of the half-breeds of the Sacs and Foxes, they holding title in the same manner as In- dians. Ratified January 18, 1825. 7. Treaty of August 19, 1S25. \u2014 At this date a treaty was made by William Clark and Lewis Cass, at Prairie du Chien, between the United States and the Chippewas, Sacs and Foxes, Me- nomonees, Winnebagoes and a portion of the Ottawas and Pottawatomies. In this treaty, in order to make peace between the contending tribes as to the limits of their respective hunting grounds in Iowa, it was agreed that the United States Government should run a boundary line between the Sioux, on the north, and the Sacs and Foxes, on the south, as follows : Commencing at the mouth of the Upper Iowa River, on the west bank of the Mississippi, and ascending said Iowa River to its west fork ; thence up the fork to its source ; thence cross- ing the fork of Red Cedar River in a direct line to the second or upper fork of the Des Moines River ; thence in a direct line to the lower fork of the Calumet River, and down that river to its junction with the Missouri River. 8. Treaty of 1830. \u2014 On the loth of July, 1830, the confederate tribes of the Sacs and Foxes ceded to the United States a strip of country lying south of the above line, twenty miles in width, and extending along the line aforesaid from the Mississippi to the Des Moines River. The Sioux also, whose possessions were north of the line, ceded to the Government, in the same treaty, a like strip on the north side of the boundary. Thus the United States, at the ratification of this treaty, February 24, 1831, came into possession of a portion of Iowa forty miles wide, extend ing along the Clark and Cass line of 1825, from the Mississippi to the Des Moines River. This territory was known as the \" Neutral Ground,\" and the tribes on either side of the line were allowed to fish and hunt on it unmolested till it was made a Winnebago reservation, and the Winnebagoes were removed to it in 1841. 9. Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes and other Tribes. \u2014 At the same time of the above treaty re specting the \" Neutral Ground\" (July 15, 1830), the Sacs and Foxes, Western Sioux, Omahas, Iowas and Missouris ceded to the United States a portion of the western slope of Iowa, the boun daries of which were defined as follows : Beginning at the upper fork of the Des Moines River, and passing the sources of the Little Sioux and Floyd Rivers, to the fork of the first creek that falls into the Big Sioux, or Calumet, on ihe east side ; thence down said creek and the Calumet"], [160, "162 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. River to the Missouri River ; thence down said Missouri River to the Missouri State line above the Kansas ; thence along said line to the northwest corner of said State ; thence to the high lands between the waters falling into the Missouri and Des Moines, passing to said high lands along the dividing ridge between the forks of the Grand River ; thence along said high lands or ridge separating the waters of the Missouri from those of the Des Moines, to a point opposite the source of the Boyer River, and thence in a direct line to the upper fork of the Des Moines, the place of beginning. It was understood that the lands ceded and relinquished by this treaty were to be assigned and allotted, under the direction of the President of the United States, to the tribes then living thereon, or to such other tribes as the President might locate thereon for hunting and other pur poses. In consideration of three tracts of land ceded in this treaty, the United States agreed to pay to the Sacs three thousand dollars ; to the Foxes, three thousand dollars ; to the Sioux, two thousand dollars; to the Yankton and Santie bands of Sioux, three thousand dollars; to the Omahas, two thousand five hundred dollars; and to the Ottoes and Missouris, two thousand five hundred dollars \u2014 to be paid annually for ten successive years. In addition to these annuities, the Government agreed to furnish some of the tribes with blacksmiths and agricultural imple ments to the amount of two hundred dollars, at the expense of the United States, and to set apart three thousand dollars annually for the education of the children of these tribes. It does not appear that any fort was erected in this territory prior to the erection of Fort Atkinson on the Neutral Ground, in 1840-41. This treaty was made by William Clark, Superintendent of Indian affairs, and Col. Willoughby Morgan, of the United States First Infantry, and came into effect by proclamation, February 24, 1831. 10. Treaty with the Winnebagoes. \u2014 Made at Fort Armstrong, Rock Island, September 15, 1832, by Gen. Winfield Scott and Hon. John Reynolds, Governor of Illinois. In this treaty the Win nebagoes ceded to the United States all their land lying on the east side of the Mississippi, and in part consideration therefor the United States granted to the Winnebagoes, to be held as other Indian lands are held, that portion of Iowa known as the Neutral Ground. The exchange of the two tracts of country was to take place on or before the 1st day of June, 1833. In addition to the Neutral Ground, it was stipulated that the United States should give the Winnebagoes, begin ning in September, 1833, and continuing for twenty-seven successive years, ten thousand dollars in specie, and establish a school among them, with a farm and garden, and provide other facili ties for the education of their children, not to exceed in cost three thousand dollars a year, and to continue the same for twenty-seven successive years. Six agriculturists, twelve yoke of oxen and plows and other farming tools were to be supplied by the Government. 11. Treaty of 1S32 with the Sacs and Foxes. \u2014 Already mentioned as the Black Hawk purchase. 12. Treaty of 1S36, with the Sacs and Foxes, ceding Keokuk's Reserve to the United States; for which the Government stipulated to pay thirty thousand dollars, and an annuity of ten thou sand dollars for ten successive years, together with other sums and debts of the Indians to various parties. 13. Treaty of 1837.\u2014 On the 21st of October, 1837, a treaty was made at the city of Wash ington, between Carey A. Harris, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the confederate tribes of Sacs and Foxes, ratified February 21, 1838, wherein another slice of the soil of Iowa was obtained, described in the treaty as follows: \"A tract of country containing 1,250,000 acres, lying west and adjoining the tract conveyed by them to the United States in the treaty of September 21, 1832. It is understood that the points of termination for the present cession shall be the north ern and southern points of said tract as fixed by the survey made under the authority of the United States, and that a line shall be drawn between them so as to intersect a line extended westwardly from the angle of said tract nearly opposite to Rock Island, as laid down in the above survey, so far as may be necessary to include the number of acres hereby ceded, which last mentioned line, it is estimated, will be about twenty-five miles.\" This piece of land was twenty-five miles wide in the middle, and ran off to a point at both ends, lying directly back of the Black Hawk Purchase, and of the same length. 14. Treaty of Relinquishrnent. \u2014 At the same date as the above treaty, in the city of Washing ton, Carey A. Harris, Commissioner, the Sacs and Foxes ceded to the United States all their right and interest in the country lying south of the boundary line between the Sacs and Foxes and Sioux, as described in the treaty of August 19, 1825, and between the Mississippi and Mis souri Rivers, the United States paying for the same one hundred and sixty thousand dollars. The Indians also gave up all claims and interests under the treaties previously made with them, for the satisfaction of which no appropriations had been made. 15. Treaty of 1842. \u2014 The last treaty was made with the Sacs and Foxes October 11, 1842; ratified March 23, 1843. It was made at the Sac and Fox agency (Agency City), by John Chambers, Commissioner on behalf of the United States. In this treaty the Sac and Fox Indians \" ceded to the United States all their lands west of the Mississippi to which they had any claim or title.\" By the terms rf this treaty they were to be removed from the country at the expira tion of three years, and all who remained after that were to move at their own expense. Part of them were removed to Kansas in the Fall of 1845, and the rest the Spring following."], [161, "163 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. SPANISH GRANTS. While the territory now embraced in the State of Iowa was under Spanish rule as a part of its province of Louisiana, certain claims to and grants of land were made by the Spanish authorities, with which, in addition to the extinguishment of Indian titles, the United States had to deal. It is proper that these should be briefly reviewed. Dubuque. \u2014 On the 22d day of September, 1788, Julien Dubuque, a French man, from Prairie du Chien, obtained from the Foxes a cession or lease of lands on the Mississippi River for mining purposes, on the site of the present city of Dubuque. Lead had been discovered here eight years before, in 1780, by the wife of Peosta Fox, a warrior, and Dubuque's claim embraced nearly all the lead bearing lands in that vicinity. He immediately took possession of his claim and commenced mining, at the same time making a settlement. The place became known as the \"Spanish Miners,\" or, more commonly, \"Dubuque's Lead Mines.\" In 1796, Dubuque filed a petition with Baron de Carondelet, the Spanish Governor of Louisiana, asking that the tract ceded to him by the Indians might be granted to him by patent from the Spanish Government. In this petition, Dubuque rather indefinitely set forth the boundaries of this claim as \" about seven leagues along the Mississippi River, and three leagues in width from the river,\" intending to include, as is supposed, the river front between the Little Maquoketa and the Tete des Mertz Rivers, embracing more than twenty thou- sand acres. Carondelet granted the prayer of the petition, and the grant was subsequently confirmed by the Board of Land Commissioners of Louisiana. In October, 1804, Dubuque transferred the larger part of his claim to Auguste Choteau, of St. Louis, and on the 17th of May, 1805, he and Choteau jointly filed their claims with the Board of Commissioners. On the 20th of September, 1806, the Board decided in their favor, pronouncing the claim to be a regular Spanish grant, made and completed prior to the 1st day of October, 1800, only one member, J. B. C. Lucas, dissenting. Dubuque died March 24, 1810. The Indians, understanding that the claim of Dubuque under their former act of cession was only a permit to occupy the tract and work the mines during his life, and that at his death they reverted to them, took possession and continued mining operations, and were sustained by the military authority of the United States, notwithstanding the decision of the Commissioners. When the Black Hawk purchase was consummated, the Du- buque claim thus held by the Indians was absorbed by the United States, as the Sacs and Foxes made no reservation of it in the treaty of 1832. The heirs of Choteau, however, were not disposed to relinquish their claim without a struggle. Late in 1832, they employed an agent to look after their interests, and authorized him to lease the right to dig lead on the lands. The miners who commenced work under this agent were compelled by the military to abandon their operations, and one of the claimants went to Galena to institute legal proceedings, but found no court of competent jurisdiction, although he did bring an action for the recovery of a quantity of lead dug at Dubuque, for the purpose of testing the title. Being unable to identify the lead, however, he was non-suited. By act of Congress, approved July 2, 1836, the town of Dubuque was sur veyed and platted. After lots had been sold and occupied by the purchasers, Henry Choteau brought an action of ejectment against Patrick Malony, who"], [162, "164 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. held land in Dubuque under a patent from the United States, for the recovery of seven undivided eighth parts of the Dubuque claim, as purchased by Auguste Choteau in 1804. The case was tried in the District Court of the United States for the District of Iowa, and was decided adversely to the plaintiff. The case was carried to the Supreme Court of the United States on a writ of error, when it was heard at the December term, 1853, and the decision of the lower court was affirmed, the court holding that the permit from Carondolet was merely a lease or permit to work the mines ; that Dubuque asked, and the Governor of Louisiana granted, nothing more than the \"peaceable possession\" of certain lands obtained from the Indians ; that Carondelet had no legal authority to make snch a grant as claimed, and that, even if he had, this was but an \" inchoate and imperfect title.\" Giard. \u2014 In 1795, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana granted to Basil Giard five thousand eight hundred and sixty acres of land, in what is now Clayton County, known as the \"Giard Tract.\" He occupied the land during the time that Iowa passed from Spain to France, and from France to the United States, in consideration of which the Federal Government granted a patent of the same to Giard in his own right. His heirs sold the whole tract to James H. Lockwood and Thomas P. Burnett, of Prairie du Chien, for three hundred dollars. Honori. \u2014 March 30, 1799, Zenon Trudeau, Acting Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana, granted to Louis Honori a tract of land on the site of the present town of Montrose, as follows : \" It is permitted to Mr. Louis (Fresson) Henori, or Louis Honore Fesson, to establish himself at the head of the rapids of the River Des Moines, and his establishment once formed, notice of it shall be given to the Governor General, in order to obtain for him a commission of a space sufficient to give value to such establishment, and at the same time to render it useful to the commerce of the peltries of this country, to watch the Indians and keep them in the fidelity which they owe to His Majesty.\" Honori took immediate possession of his claim, which he retained until 1805. While trading with the natives, he became indebted to Joseph Robedoux, who obtained an execution on which the property was sold May 13, 1803, and was purchased by the creditor. In these proceedings the property was described as being \" about six leagues above the River Des Moines.\" Robedoux died soon after lie purchased the proprerty. Auguste Choteau, his executor, disposed of the Honori tract to Thomas F. Reddeck, in April, 1805, up to which time Honori continued to occupy it. The grant, as made by the Spanish government, was a league square, but only one mile square was confirmed by the Uuited States. After the half-breeds sold their lands, in which the Honori grant was included, various claimants resorted to litigation in attempts to invalidate the title of the Reddeck heirs, but it was finally confirmed by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1839, and is the oldest legal title to any land in the State of Iowa. THE HALF-BREED TRACT. Before any permanent settlement had been made in the Territory of Iowa, white adventurers, trappers and traders, many of whom were scattered along the Mississippi and its tributaries, as agents and employes of the American Fur Company, intermarried with the females of the Sac and Fox Indians, producing a race of half-breeds, whose number was never definitely ascertained. There were some respectable and excellent people among them, children of men of some refinement and education. For instance : Dr. Muir, a gentleman educated"], [163, "165 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. at Edinburgh, Scotland, a surgeon in the United States Army, stationed at a military post located on the present site of Warsaw, married an Indian woman, and reared his family of three daughters in the city of Keokuk. Other exam ples might be cited, but they are probably exceptions to the general rule, and the race is now nearly or quite extinct in Iowa. A treaty was made at Washington, August 4, 1824, between the Sacs and Foxes and the United States, by which that portion of Lee County was reserved to the half-breeds of those tribes, and which was afterward known as \" The Half-Breed Tract.\" This reservation is the triangular piece of land, containing about 119,000 acres, lying between the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers. It is bounded on the north by the prolongation of the northern line of Missouri. This line was intended to be a straight one, running due cast, which would have caused it to strike the Mississippi River at or below Montrose ; but the surveyor who run it took no notice of the change in the variation of the needle as he proceeded eastward, and, in consequence, the line he run was bent, deviating more and more to the northward of a direct line as he approached the Mississippi, so that it struck that river at the lower edge of the town of Fort Madison. \" This errone ous line,\" says Judge Mason, \"has been acquiesced in as well in fixing the northern limit of the Half-Breed Tract as in determining the northern boundary line of the State of Missouri.\" The line thus run included in the reservation a portion of the lower part of the city of Fort Madison, and all of the present townships of Van Buren, Charleston, Jefferson, Des Moines, Montrose and Jackson- Under the treaty of 1824, the half-breeds had the right to occupy the soil, but could not convey it, the reversion being reserved to the United States. But on the 30th day of January, 1834, by act of Congress, this reversionary right was relinquished, and the half-breeds acquired the lands in fee simple. This was no sooner done, than a horde of speculators rushed in to buy land of the half-breed owners, and, in many instances, a gun, a blanket, a pony or a few quarts of whisky was sufficient for the purchase of large estates. There was a deal of sharp practice on both sides ; Indians would often claim ownership of land by virtue of being half-breeds, and had no difficulty in proving their mixed blood by the Indians, and they would then cheat the speculators by selling land to which they had no rightful title. On the other hand, speculators often claimed land in which they had no ownership. It was diamond cut diamond, until at last things became badly mixed. There were no authorized surveys, and no boundary lines to claims, and, as a natural result, numerous conflicts and quarrels ensued. To settle these difficulties, to decide the validity of claims or sell them for the benefit of the real owners, by act of the Legislature of Wisconsin Territory, approved January 16, 1838, Edward Jolmstone, Thomas S. Wilson and David Brigham were appointed Commissioners, and clothed with power to effect these objects. The act provided that these Commissioners should be paid six dollars a day each. The commission entered upon its duties and continued until the next session of the Legislature, when the act creating it was repealed, invalidat ing all that had been done and depriving the Commissioners of their pay. The repealing act, however, authorized the Commissioners to commence action against the owners of the Half-Breed Tract, to receive pay for their services, in the Dis trict Court of Lee County. Two judgments were obtained, and on execution the whole of the tract was sold to Hugh T. Reid, the Sheriff executing the deed. Mr. Reid sold portions of it to various parties, but his own title was questioned and he became involved in litigation. Decisions in favor of Reid"], [164, "166 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. and those holding under him were made by both District and Supreme Courts, but in December, 1850, these decisions were finally reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Joseph Webster, plaintiff in error, vs. Hugh T. Reid, and the judgment titles failed. About nine years before the \"judgment titles \" were finally abrogated as above, another class of titles were brought into competition with them, and in the conflict between the two, the final decision was obtained. These were the titles based on the \" decree of partition ' ' issued by the United States District Court for the Territory of Iowa, on the 8th of May, 1841, and certified to by the Clerk on the 2d day of June of that year. Edward Johnstone and Hugh T. Reid, then law partners at Fort Madison, filed the petition for the decree in behalf of the St. Louis claimants of half-breed lands. Francis S. Key, author of the Star Spangled Banner, who was then attorney for the New York Land Company, which held heavy interests in these lands, took a leading part in the measure, and drew up the document in which it was presented to the court. Judge Charles Mason, of Burlington, pre sided. The plan of partition divided the tract into one hundred and one shares and arranged that each claimant should draw his proportion by lot, and should abide the result, whatever it might be. The arrangement was entered into, the lots drawn, and the plat of the same filed in the Recorder's office, October 6, 1841. Upon this basis the titles to land in the Half-Breed Tract are now held. EARLY SETTLEMENTS. The first permanent settlement by the whites within the limits of Iowa was made by Julien Dubuque, in 1788, when, with a small party of miners, he set tled on the site of the city that now bears his name, where he lived until his death, in 1810. Louis Honori settled on the site of the present town of Mon trose, probably in 1799, and resided there until 1805, when his property passed into other hands. Of the Giard settlement, opposite Prairie du Chien, little is known, except that it was occupied by some parties prior to the commencement of the present century, and contained three cabins in 1805. Indian traders, although not strictly to be considered settlers, had established themselves at various points at an early date. A Mr. Johnson, agent of the American Fur Company, had a trading post below Burlington, where he carried on traffic with the Indians some time before the United States possessed the country. In 1820, Le Moliese, a French trader, had a station at what is now Sandusky, six miles above Keokuk, in Lee County. In 1829, Dr. Isaac Gallaud made a set tlement on the Lower Rapids, at what is now Nashville. The first settlement in Lee County was made in 1820, by Dr. Samuel C. Muir, a surgeon in the United States army, who had been stationed at Fort Edwards, now Warsaw, 111., and who built a cabin where the city of Keokuk now stands. Dr. Muir was a man of strict integrity and irreproachable char acter. While stationed at a military post on the Upper Mississippi, he had married an Indian woman of the Fox nation. Of his marriage, the following romantic account is given : The post at which he was stationed was visited by a beautiful Indian maiden \u2014 whose native name, unfortunately, has not been preserved \u2014 who, in her dreams, had seen a white brave un moor his canoe, paddle it across the river and come directly to her lodge. She felt assured, according to the superstitious belief of her race, that, in her dreams, she had seen her future husband, and had come to the fort to find him. Meeting Dr. Muir, she instantly recognized him as the hero of her dream, which, with childlike innocence and simplicity, she related to him. Her dream was, indeed, prophetic. Charmed with Sophia's beauty, innocence and devo tion, the doctor honorably married her ; but after a while, the sneers and gibes of his brother"], [165, "167 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. officers \u2014 less honorable than he, perhaps \u2014 made him feel ashamed of his dark-skinned wife, and when his regiment was ordered down the river, to Bellefontaine, it is said he embraced the opportunity to rid himself of her, and left her, never expecting to see her again, aud little dreaming that she would have the courage to follow him. But, with her infant child, this in trepid wife and mother started alone in her canoe, and, after many days of weary labor and a lonely journey of nine hundred miles, she, at last, reached him. She afterward remarked, when speaking of this toilsome journey down the river in search of her husband, \" When I got there I was all perished away \u2014 so thin ! \" The doctor, touched by such unexampled devotion, took her to his heart, and ever after, until his death, treated her with marked respect. She always pre sided at his table with grace and dignity, but never abandoned her native style of dress. In 181 9-20, he was stationed at Fort Edward, but the senseless ridicule of some of his brother officers on account of his Indian wife induced him to resign his commission. After building his cabin, as above stated, he leased his claim for a term of years to Otis Reynolds and John Culver, of St. Louis, and went to La Pointe, afterward Galena, where he practiced his profession for ten years, when he returned to Keokuk. His Indian wife bore to him four children \u2014 Louise (married at Keokuk, since dead), James, (drowned at Keokuk), Mary and Sophia. Dr. Muir died suddenly of cholera, in 1832, but left his property in such condition that it was soon wasted in vexatious litigation, and his brave and faithful wife, left friendless and penniless, became discouraged, and, with her children, disappeared, and, it is said, returned to her people on the Upper Missouri. Messrs. Reynolds k Culver, who had leased Dr. Muir's claim at Keokuk, subsequently employed as their agent Mr. Moses Stillwell, who arrived with his family in 1828, and took possession of Muir's cabin. His brothers-in-law, Amos and Valencourt Van Ansdal, came with him and settled near. His daughter, Margaret Stillwell (afterward Mrs. Ford) was born in 1831. at the foot of the rapids, called by the Indians Puch-a-she-tuck, where Keokuk now stands. She was probably the first white American child born in Iowa. In 1831, Mr. Johnson, Agent of the American Fur Company, who had a station at the foot of the rapids, removed to another location, and, Dr. Muir having returned from Galena, he and Isaac R. Campbell took the place and buildings vacated by the Company and carried on trade with the Indians and half-breeds. Campbell, who had first visited and traveled through the southern part of Iowa, in 1821, was an enterprising settler, and besides trading with the natives carried on a farm and kept a tavern. Dr. Muir died of cholera in 1832. In 1830, James L. and Lucius H. Langworthy, brothers and natives of Vermont, visited the Territory for the purpose of working the lead mines at Du- buque. They had been engaged in lead mining at Galena, Illinois, the former from as early as 1824. The lead mines in the Dubuque region were an object of great interest to the miners about Galena, for they were known to be rich in lead ore. To explore these mines and to obtain permission to work them was therefore eminently desirable. In 1829, James L. Langworthy resolved to visit the Dubuque mines. Cross ing the Mississippi at a point now known as Dunleith, in a canoe, and swim ming his horse by his side, he landed on the spot now known as Jones Street Levee. Before him spread out a beautiful prairie, on which the city of Du buque now stands. Two miles south, at the mouth of Catfish Creek, was a vil lage of Sacs and Foxes. Thither Mr. Langworthy proceeded, and was well re ceived by the natives. He endeavored to obtain permission from them to mine in their hills, but this they refused. He, however, succeeded in gaining the con fidence of the chief to such an extent as to be allowed to travel in the interior for three weeks and explore the country. He employed two young Indians as guides, and traversed in different directions the whole region lying between the Maquoketa and Turkey Rivers. He returned to the village, secured the good will of the Indians, and, returning to Galena, formed plans for future opera tions, to be executed as soon as circumstances would permit."], [166, "168 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. In 1830, with his brother, Lucius H., and others, having obtained the con sent of the Indians, Mr. Langworthy crossed the Mississippi and commenced mining in the vicinity around Dubuque. At this time, the lands were not in the actual possession of the United States. Although they had been purchased from France, the Indian title had not been extinguished, and these adventurous persons were beyond the limits of any State or Territorial government. The first settlers were therefore obliged to be their own law-makers, and to agree to such regulations as the exigencies of the case demanded. The first act resembling civil legislation within the limits of the present State of Iowa was done by the miners at this point, in June, 1830. They met on the bank of the river, by the side of an old cottonwood drift log, at what is now the Jones Street Levee, Dubuque, and elected a Committee, con sisting of J. L. Langworthy, H. F. Lander, James McPhetres, Samuel Scales, and E. M. Wren. This may be called the first Legislature in Iowa, the mem bers of which gathered around that old cottonwood log, and agreed to and re ported the following, written by Mr. Langworthy, on a half sheet of coarse, un ruled paper, the old log being the writing desk : We, a Commiltee having been chosen to draft certain rules and regulations (laws) by which we as miners will be governed, and having duly considered the subject, do unanimously agree that we will be governed by the regulations on the east side of the Mississippi River,* with the following exceptions, to wit : Article I. That each and every man shall hold 200 yards square of ground by working said ground one day in six. Article If. We further agree that there shall be chosen, by the majority of the miners present, a person who shall hold this article, and who shall grant letters of arbitration on appli cation having been made, and that said letters of arbitration shall be obligatory on the parties so applying. The report was accepted by the miners present, who elected Dr. Jarote, in accordance with Article 2. Here, then, we have, in 1830, a primitive Legisla ture elected by the people, the law drafted by it being submitted to the people for approval, and under it Dr. Jarote was elected first Governor within the limits of the present State of Iowa. And it is to be said that the laws thus enacted were as promptly obeyed, and the acts of the executive officer thus elected as duly respected, as any have been since. The miners who had thus erected an independent government of their own on the west side of the Mississippi River continued to work successfully for a Ions time, and the new settlement attracted considerable attention. But the west side of the Mississippi belonged to the Sac and Fox Indians, and the Gov ernment, in order to preserve peace on the frontier, as well as to protect the Indians in their rights under the treaty, ordered the settlers not only to stop mining, but to remove from the Indian territory. They were simply intruders. The execution of this order was entrusted to Col. Zachary Taylor, then in com mand of the military post at Prairie du Chien, who, early in July, sent an officer to the miners with orders to forbid settlement, and to command the miners to remove within ten days to the east side of the Mississippi, or they would be driven off by armed force. The miners, however, were reluctant about leaving the rich \"leads\" they had already discovered and opened, and were not dis posed to obey the order to remove with any considerable degree of alacrity. In due time, Col. Taylor dispatched a detachment of troops to enforce his order. The miners, anticipating their arrival, had, excepting three, recrossed the river, and from the east bank saw the troops land on the western shore. The three who had lingered a little too long were, however, permitted to make their escape * Established by the Superintendent of U. S. Lead Mines at Fever River."], [167, "169 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. unmolested. From this time, a military force was stationed at Dubuque to prevent the settlers from returning, until June, 1832. The Indians returned, and were encouaged to operate the rich mines opened by the late white occupants. In June, 1832, the troops were ordered to the east side to assist in the annihilation of the very Indians whose rights they had been protecting on the west side. Immediately after the close of the Black Hawk war, and the negotia tions of the treaty in September, 1832, by which the Sacs and Foxes ceded to the United States the tract known as the \"Black Hawk Purchase,\" the set tlers, supposing that now they had a right to re-enter the territory, returned and took possession of their claims, built cabins, erected furnaces and prepared large quantities of lead for market. Dubuque was becoming a noted place on the river, but the prospects of the hardy and enterprising settlers and miners were again ruthlessly interfered with by the Government, on the ground that the treaty with the Indians would not go into force until June 1, 1833, although they had withdrawn from the vicinity of the settlement. Col. Taylor was again ordered by the War Department to remove the miners, and in January, 1833, troops were again sent from Prairie du Chien to Dubuque for that purpose. This was a serious and perhaps unnecessary hardship imposed upon the settlers. They were compelled to abandon their cabins and homes in mid-winter. It must now be said, simply, that \"red tape\" should be respected. The purchase had been made, the treaty ratified, or was sure to be ; the Indians had retired, and, after the lapse of nearly fifty years, no very satisfactory reason for this rigorous action of the Government can be given. But the orders had been given, and there was no alternative but to obey. Many of the settlers recrossed the river, and did not return ; a few, however, removed to an island near the east bank of the river, built rude cabins of poles, in which to store their lead until Spring, when they could float the fruits of their labor to St. Louis for sale, and where they could remain until the treaty went into force, when they could return. Among these were James L. Lang worthy, and his brother Lucius, who had on hand about three hundred thousand pounds of lead. Lieut. Covington, who had been placed in command at Dubuque by Col. Taylor, ordered some of the cabins of the settlers to be torn down, and wagons and other property to be destroyed. This wanton and inexcusable action on the part of a subordinate clothed with a little brief authority was sternly rebuked by Col. Taylor, and Covington was superseded by Lieut. George Wil son, who pursued a just and friendly course with the pioneers, who were only waiting for the time when they could repossess their claims. June 1, 1833, the treaty formally went into effect, the troops were withdrawn, and the Langworthy brothers and a few others at once returned and resumed possession of their home claims and mineral prospects, and from this time the first permanent settlement of this portion of Iowa must date. Mr. John P. Sheldon was appointed Superintendent of the mines by the Government, and a system of permits to miners and licenses to smelters was adopted, similar to that which had been in operation at Galena, since 1825, under Lieut. Martin Thomas and Capt. Thomas C. Legate. Substantially the primitive law enacted by the miners assembled around that old cottonwood drift log in 1830 was adopted and enforced by the United States Government, except that miners were required to sell their mineral to licensed smelters and the smelter was required to give bonds for the payment of six per cent, of all lead manufactured to the Government. This was the same rule adopted in the United States mines on Fever River in"], [168, "170 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Illinois, except that, until 1830, the Illinois miners were compelled to pay 10 per cent. tax. This tax upon the miners created much dissatisfaction among the miners on the west side as it had on the east side of the Mississippi. They thought they had suffered hardships and privations enough in opening the way for civilization, without being subjected to the imposition of an odious Govern ment tax upon their means of subsistence, when the Federal Government could better afford to aid than to extort from them. The measure soon became unpop ular. It was difficult to collect the taxes, and the whole system was abolished in about ten years. During 1833, after the Indian title was fully extinguished, about five hun dred people arrived at the mining district, about one hundred and fifty of them from Galena. - In the same year, Mr. Langworthy assisted in building the first school house in Iowa, and thus was formed the nucleus of the now populous and thriving City of Dubuque. Mr. Langworthy lived to see the naked prairie on which he first landed become the site of a city of fifteen thousand inhabitants, the small school house which he aided in constructing replaced by three substantial edifices, wherein two thousand children were being trained, churches erected in every part of the city, and railroads connecting the wilderness which he first explored with all the eastern world. He died suddenly on the 13th of March, 1865, while on a trip over the Dubuque & Southwestern Railroad, at Monticello, and the evening train brought the news of his death and his remains. Lucius H. Langworthy, his brother, was one of the most worthy, gifted and influential of the old settlers of this section of Iowa. He died, greatly lamented by many friends, in June, 1865. The name Dubuque was given to the settlement by the miners at a meeting held in 1834. In 1832, Captain James White made a claim on the present site of Montrose. In 1834, a military post was established at this point, and a garrison of cavalry was stationed here, under the command of Col. Stephen W. Kearney. The soldiers were removed from this post to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1837. During the same year, 1832, soon after the close of the Black Hawk War, Zachariah Hawkins, Benjamin Jennings, Aaron White, Augustine Horton, Samuel Gooch, Daniel Thompson and Peter Williams made claims at Fort Madison. In 1833, these claims were purchased by John and Nathaniel Knapp, upon which, in 1835, they laid out the town. The next Summer, lots were sold. The town was subsequently re-surveyed and platted by the United States Government. At the close of the Black Hawk War. parties who had been impatiently looking across upon \"Flint Hills,\" now Burlington, came over from Illinois and made claims The first was Samuel S. White, in the Fall of 1832, who erected a cabin on the site of the city of Burlington. About the same time, David Tothero made a claim on the prairie about three miles back from the river, ata place since known as thefaim of Judge Morgan. In the Winter of that year, they were driven off by the military from Rock Island, as intruders upon the rights of the Indians, and White's cabin was burnt by the soldiers. He retired to Illinois, where he spent the Winter, and in the Summer, as soon as the Indian title was extinguished, returned and rebuilt his cabin. White was joined by his brother-in-law, Doolittle, and they laid out the original town of Burlington in 1834. All along the river borders of the Black Hawk Purchase settlers were flocking into Iowa. Immediately after the treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, in Septeui-"], [169, "171 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. ber, 1832, Col. George Davenport made the first claim on the spot where the thriving city of Davenport now stands. As early as 1827, Col. Davenport had established a flatboat ferry, which ran between the island and the main shore of Iowa, by which he carried on a trade with the Indians west of the Mississippi. In 1833, Capt. Benjamin W. Clark moved across from Illinois, and laid the foundation of the town of Buffalo, in Scott County, which was the first actual settlement within the limits of that county. Among other early settlers in this part of the Territory were Adrian H. Davenport, Col. John Sullivan, Mulli gan and Franklin Easly, Capt. John Coleman, J. M. Camp, William White, H. W. Higgins, Cornelius Harrold, Richard Harrison, E. H. Shepherd and Dr. E. S. Barrows. \u25a0 The first settlers of Davenport were Antoine LeClaire, Col. George Daven port, Major Thomas Smith, Major William Gordon, Philip Hambough, Alexan der W. McGregor, Levi S. Colton, Capt. James May and others. Of Antoine LeClaire, as the representative of the two races of men who at this time occu pied Iowa, Hon. C. C. Nourse, in his admirable Centennial Address, says : \" Antoine LeClaire was born at St. Joseph, Michigan, in 1797. His father was French, his mother a granddaughter of a Pottowatomie chief. In 1818, he acted as official interpreter to Col. Davenport, at Fort Armstrong (now Rock Island). He was well acquainted with a dozen Indian dialects, and was a man of strict integrity and great energy. In 1820, he married the granddaughter of a Sac chief. The Sac and Fox Indians reserved for him and his wife two sections of land in the treaty of 1833, one at the town of LeClaire and one at Davenport. The Pottawatomies, in the treaty at Prairie du Chien, also reserved for him two sections of land, at the present site of Moline, 111. He received the appointment of Postmaster and Justice of the Peace in the Black Hawk Purchase, at an early day. In 1833, he bought for \u00a7100 a claim on the land upon which the original town of Davenport was surveyed and platted in 1836. In 1836, LeClaire built the hotel, known since, with its valuable addi tion, as the LeClaire House. He died September 25, 1861.\" In Clayton County, the first settlement was made in the Spring of 1832, on Turkey River, by Robert Hatfield and William W. Wayman. No further settlement was made in this part of the State till the beginning of 1836. In that portion now known as Muscatine County, settlements were made in 1834, by Benjamin Nye, John Vanater and G.

Abernethy and Alexis Smith were early settlers of Muscatine. During the Summer of 1835, William Bennett and his family, from Galena, built the first cabin within the present limits of Delaware County, in some timber since known as Eads' Grove. The first post office in Iowa was established at Dubuque in 1833. Milo II. Prentice was appointed Postmaster. The first Justice of the Peace was Antoine Le Claire, appointed in 1833, as \"a very suitable person to adjust the difficulties between the white settlers and the Indians still remaining there.\" The first Methodist Society in the Territory was formed at Dubuque on the 18th of May, 1834, and the first class meeting was held June 1st of that year- T . \u201e , _\u201e.

The first school house in the Territory was erected by the Dubuque miners in 1833. The first Sabbath school was organized at Dubuque early in the Summer of 1834. The first woman who came to this part of the Territory with a view to per manent residence was Mrs. Noble F. Dean, in the Fall of 1832. The first family that lived in this part of Iowa was that of Hosea T. Camp, in 1832. The first meeting house was built by the Methodist Episcopal Church, at Dubuque, in 1834. The first newspaper in Iowa was the Dubuque Visitor, issued May 11th, 1836. John King, afterward Judge King, was editor, and William C. Jones, printer. The pioneers of Iowa, as a class, were brave, hardy, intelligent and enterprising people. As early as 1824, a French trader named Hart had established a trading post, and built a cabin on the bluffs above the large spring now known as \"Mynster Spring,\" within the limits of the present city of Council Bluffs, and had probably been there some time, as the post was known to the employes of the American Fur Company as Lacote de Hart, or \" Hart's Bluff.\" In 1827, an agent of the American Fur Company, Francis Guittar, with others, encamped in the timber at the foot of the bluffs, about on the present location of Broad way, and afterward settled there. In 1839, a block house was built on the bluff in the east part of the city. The Pottawatomie Indians occupied this part of the State until 1846-7, when they relinquished the territory and removed to Kansas. Billy Caldwell was then principal chief. There were no white settlers in that part of the State except Indian traders, until the arrival of the Mormons under the lead of Brigham Young. These people on their way westward halted for the Winter of 1846-7 on the west bank of the Missouri River, about five miles above Omaha, at a place now called Florence. Some of them had reached the eastern bank of the river the Spring before, in season to plant a crop. In the Spring of 1847, Young and a portion of the colony pursued their journey to Salt Lake, but a large portion of them returned to the Iowa side and settled mainly within the limits of Pottawattamie County. The principal settle ment of this strange community was at a place first called \" Miller's Hollow,\" on Indian Creek, and afterward named Kanesville, in honor of Col. Kane, of Pennsylvania, who visited them soon afterward. The Mormon settlement extended over the county and into neighboring counties, wherever timber and water furnished desirable locations. Orson Hyde, priest, lawyer and editor, was installed as President of the Quorum of Twelve, and all that part of the State remained under Mormon control for several y^ears. In 1846, they raised a bat talion, numbering some five hundred men, for the Mexican war. In 1848, Hyde started a paper called the Frontier Guardian, at Kanesville. In 1849, after many of the faithful had left to join Brigham Young at Salt Lake, the Mormons in this section of Iowa numbered 6,552, and in 1850, 7,828, but they were not all within' the limits of Pottawattamie County. This county was organized in 1848, all the first officials being Mormons. In 1852, the order was promulgated that all the true believers should gather together at Salt Lake. Gentiles flocked in, and in a few years nearly all the first settlers were gone. May 9, 1843, Captain James Allen, with a small detachment of troops on board the steamer lone, arrived at the present site of the capital of the State, Des Moines. The lone was the first steamer to ascend the Des Moines River to this point. The troops and stores were landed at what is now the foot of"], [171, "173 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Court avenue, Des Moines, and Capt. Allen returned in the steamer to Fort Sanford to arrange for bringing up more soldiers and supplies. . In due time they, too, arrived, and a fort was built near the mouth of Raccoon Fork, at its confluence with the Des Moines, and named Fort Des Moines. Soon after the arrival of the troops, a trading post was established on the east side of the river, by two noted Indian traders named Ewing, from Ohio. Among the first settlers in this part of Iowa were Benjamin Bryant, J. B. Scott, James Drake (gunsmith), John Sturtevant, Robert Kinzie, Alexander Turner, Peter Newcomer, and others. The Western States have been settled by many of the best and most enter prising men of the older States, and a large immigration of the best blood of the Old World, who, removing to an arena of larger opportunities, in a more fertile soil and congenial climate, have developed a spirit and an energy peculiarly Western. In no country on the globe have enterprises of all kinds been pushed forward with such rapidity, or has there been such independence and freedom of competition. Among those who have pioneered the civiliza tion of the West, and been the founders of great States, none have ranked higher in the scale of intelligence and moral worth than the pioneers of Iowa, who came to the territory when it was an Indian country, and through hardship, privation and suffering, laid the foundations of the populous and prosperous commonwealth which to-day dispenses its blessings to a million and a quarter of people. From her first settlement and from her first organization as a terri tory to the present day, Iowa has had able men to manage her affairs, wise statesmen to shape her destiny and frame her laws, and intelligent and impartial jurists to administer justice to her citizens ; her bar, pulpit and press have been able and widely influential ; and in all the professions, arts, enterprises and industries which go to make up a great and prosperous commonwealth, she has taken and holds a front rank among her sister States of the West. TERRITORIAL HISTORY. By act of Congress, approved October 31, 1803, the President of the United States was authorized to take possession of the territory included in the Louisiana purchase, and provide for a temporary government. By another act of the same session, approved March 26, 1804, the newly acquired country was divided, October 1, 1804 into the Territory of Orleans, south of the thirty-third parallel of north latitude, and the district of Louisiana, which latter was pilaced under the authority of the officers of Indiana Territory. In 1805, the District of Louisiana was organized as a Territory with a gov ernment of its own. In 1807, Iowa was included in the Territory of Illinois, and in 1812 in the Territory of Missouri. When Missouri was admitted as a State, March 2, 1821, \"Iowa,\" says Hon. C. C. Nourse, \"was left a political orphan,\" until by act of Congress, approved June 28, 1834, the Black Hawk purchase having been made, all the territory west of the Mississippi and north of the northern boundary of Missouri, was made a part of Michigan Territory. Up to this time there had been no county or other organization in what is now the State of Iowa, although one or two Justices of the Peace had been appointed and a post office was established at Dubuque in 1833. In September, 1834, however, the Territorial Legislature of Michigan created two counties on the west side of the Mississippi River, viz. : Dubuque and Des Moines, separated by a line drawn westward from the foot of Rock Island. These counties were"], [172, "174 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. partially organized. John King was appointed Chief Justice of Dubuque County, and Isaac Leffler, of Burlington, of Des Moines County. Two Associate Justices, in each county, were appointed by the Governor. On the first Monday in October, 1835, Gen. George W. Jones, now a citi zen of Dubuque, was elected a Delegate to Congress from this part of Michigan Territory. On the 20th of April, 1836, through the efforts of Gen. Jones, Congress passed a bill creating the Territory of Wisconsin, which went into operation, July 4, 1836, and Iowa was then included in THE TERRITORY OF WISCONSIN, of which Gen. Henry Dodge was appointed Governor; John S. Horner, Secre tary of the Territory ; Charles Dunn, Chief Justice ; David Irwin and William C. Frazer, Associate Justices. . September 9, 1836, Governor Dodge ordered the census of the new Territory to be taken. This census resulted in showing a population of 10,531 in the counties of Dubuque and Des Moines. Under the apportionment, these two counties were entitled to six members of the Council and thirteen of the House of Representatives. The Governor issued his proclamation for an election to be held on the first Monday of October, 1836, on which day the following members of the First Territorial Legislature of Wisconsin were elected from the two counties in the Black Hawk purchase : Dubuque County. \u2014 Council: John Fally, Thomas McKnight, Thomas Mc- Craney. House : Loring Wheeler, Hardin Nowlan, Peter Hill Engle, Patrick Quigley, Hosea T. Camp. Des Moines County. \u2014 Council: Jeremiah Smith, Jr., Joseph B. Teas, Arthur B. Ingram. House: Isaac Leffler, Thomas Blair, Warren L. Jenkins, John Box, George W. Teas, Eli Reynolds, David R. Chance. The first Legislature assembled at Belmont, in the present State of Wiscon sin, on the 25th day of October, 1836, and was organized by electing Henry T. Baird President of the Council, and Peter Hill Engle, of Dubuque, Speaker of the House. It adjourned December 9, 1836. The second Legislature assembled at Burlington, November 10, 1837. Adjourned January 20, 1838. The third session was at Burlington ; com menced June 1st, and adjourned June 12, 1838. During the first session of the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, in 1836, the county of Des Moines was divided into Des Moines, Lee, Van Buren, Henry, Muscatine and Cook (the latter being subsequently changed to Scott) and defined their boundaries. During the second session, out of the territory embraced in Dubuque County, were created the counties of Dubuque, Clayton, Fayette, Delaware, Buchanan, Jackson, Jones, Linn, Clinton and Cedar, and their boun daries defined, but the most of them were not organized until several years afterward, under the authority of the Territorial Legislature of Iowa. The question of a separate territorial organization for Iowa, which was then a part of Wisconsin Territory, began to be agitated early in the Autumn of 1S37. The wishes of the people found expression in a convention held at Bur lington on the 1st of November, which memorialized Congress to organize a Territory west of the Mississippi, and to settle the boundary line between Wis consin Territory and Missouri. The Territorial Legislature of Wisconsin, then in session at Burlington, joined in the petition. Gen. George W. Jones, of Dubuque, then residing at Sinsinawa Mound, in what is now Wisconsin, was Delegate to Congress from Wisconsin Territory, and labored so earnestly and successfully, that \" An act to divide the Territory of Wisconsin, and to estab-"], [173, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 175 lish the Territorial Government of Iowa,\" was approved June 12, 1838, to take effect and be in force on and after July 3, 1838. The new Territory embraced \" all that part of the present Territory of Wisconsin which lies west of the Mis sissippi River, and west of a line drawn due north from the head water or sources of the Mississippi to the territorial line.\" The organic act provided for a Governor, whose term of office should be three years, and for a Secretary, Chief Justice, two Associate Justices, and Attorney and Marshal, who should serve four years, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The act also provided for the election, by the white male inhabitants, citizens of the United States, over twenty-one years of age, of a House of Representatives, consisting of twenty-six members, and a Council, to consist of thirteen members. It also appropriated $5,000 for a public library, and $20,000 for the erection of public buildings. President Van Buren appointed Ex-Governor Robert Lucas, of Ohio, to be the first Governor of the new Territory. William B. Conway, of Pittsburgh, was appointed Secretary of the Territory; Charles Mason, of Burlington, Chief Justice, and Thomas S. Wilson, of Dubuque, and Joseph Williams, of Pennsylvania, Associate Judges of the Supreme and District Courts; Mr. Var. Allen, of New York, Attorney; Francis Gehon, of Dubuque, Marshal; Au gustus C. Dodge, Register of the Land Office at Burlington, and Thomas Me Knight, Receiver of the Land Office at Dubuque. Mr. Van Allen, the District, Attorney, died at Rockingham, soon after his appointment, and Col. Charles. Weston was appointed to fill his vacancy. Mr. Conway, the Secretary, also died at Burlington, during the second session of the Legislature, and Jamei Clarke, editor of the Gazette, was appointed to succeed him. Immediately after his arrival, Governor Lucas issued a proclamation for tho election of members of the first Territorial Legislature, to be held on the 10th of September, dividing the Territory into election districts for that purpose, and appointing the 12th day of November for meeting of the Legislature to be elected, at Burlington. The first Territorial Legislature was elected in September and assembled at Burlington on the 12th of November, and consisted of the following members: Council. \u2014 Jesse B. Brown, J. Keith, E. A. M. Swazey, Arthur Ingram, Robert Ralston, George Hepner, Jesse J. Payne, D. B. Hughes, James M Clark, Charles Whittlesey, Jonathan W. Parker, Warner Lewis, Stepheii Hempstead. House. \u2014 William Patterson, Hawkins Taylor, Calvin J. Price, James Brierly, James Hall, Gideon S. Bailey, Samuel Parker, James W. Grimes, George Temple, Van B. Delashmutt, Thomas Blair, George H. Beeler/ William G. Coop, William H. Wallace, Asbury B. Porter, John Frierson, William L. Toole, Levi Thornton, S. C. Hastings, Robert G. Roberts, Laurel Summers, f Jabez A. Burchard, Jr., Chauncey Swan, Andrew Bankson, Thomas Cox and Hardin Nowlin. Notwithstanding a large majority of the members of both branches of the Legislature were Democrats, yet Gen. Jesse B. Browne (Whig), of Lee County, was elected President of the Council, and Hon. William H. Wallace (Whig), of Henry County, Speaker of the House of Representatives \u2014 the former unani mously and the latter with but little opposition. At that time, national politics *Cynie S. Jacobs, -who was elected for lies Moines County, was killed in an unfortunate encounter at Burlington before the meeting of the Legislature, and Mr. Beeler was elected to fill the vacancy. f Samuel R. Murray was returned ad elected from Clinton County, but his seat was successfully contested by Burchard."], [174, "176 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. i were little heeded by the people of the new Territory, but in 1840, during the Presidential campaign, party lines were strongly drawn. At the election in September, 1838, for members of the Legislature, a Con gressional Delegate was also elected. There were four candidates, viz. : William W. Chapman and David Rohrer, of Des Moines County ; B. F. Wallace, of Henry County, and P. II. Engle, of Dubuque County. Chapman was elected, receiving a majority of thirty-six over Engle. The first session of the Iowa Territorial Legislature Was a stormy and excit ing one. By the organic law, the Governor was clothed with almost unlimited veto power. Governor Lucas seemed disposed to make free use of it, and the independent Hawkeyes could not quietly submit to arbitrary and absolute rule, and the result was an unpleasant controversy between the Executive and Legis lative departments. Congress, however, by act approved March 3, 1839, amended the organic law by restricting the veto power of the Governor to the two-thirds rule, and took from him the power to appoint Sheriffs and Magistrates. Among the first important matters demanding attention was the location of the seat of government and provision for the erection of public buildings, for which Congress had appropriated $20,000. Governor Lucas, in his message, had recommended the appointment of Commissioners, with a view to making a central location. The extent of the future State of Iowa was not known or thought of. Only on a strip of land fifty miles wide, bordering on the Missis sippi River, was the Indian title extinguished, and a central location meant some central point in the Black Hawk Purchase. The friends of a central location supported the Governor's suggestion. The southern members were divided between Burlington and Mount Pleasant, but finally united on the latter as the proper location for the seat of government. The central and southern parties were very nearly equal, and, in consequence, much excitement prevailed. The central party at last triumphed, and on the 21st day of January, 1839, an act was passed, appointing Chauncey Swan, of Dubuque County ; John Ronalds, of Louisa County, and Robert Ralston, of Des Moines County, Commissioners, to select a site for a permanent seat of Government within the limits of John son Countv. Johnson County had been created by act of the Territorial Legislature of Wisconsin, approved December 21, 1837, and organized by act passed at the special session at Burlington in June, 1838, the organization to date from July 4th, following. Napoleon, on the Iowa River, a few miles below the future Iowa City, was designated as the county seat, temporarily. Then there existed good reason for locating the capital in the county. The Territory of Iowa was bounded on the north by the British Possessions ; east, by the Mississippi River to its source; thence by a line drawn due north to the northern boundary of the United States; south, by the State of Missouri, and west, by the Missouri and White Earth Rivers. But this immense territory was in un disputed possession of the Indians, except a strip on the Mississippi, known as the Black Hawk Purchase. Johnson County was, from north to south, in the geographical center of this purchase, and as near the east and west geographical center of the future State of Iowa as could then be made, as the boundary line between the lands of the United States and the Indians, established by the treaty of October 21, 1837, was immediately west of the county limits. The Commissioners, after selecting the site, were directed to lay out 640 acres into a town, to be called Iowa City, and to proceed to sell lots and erect public buildings thereon, Congress having granted a section of land to be selected by the Territory for this purpose. The Commissioners met at Napo-"], [175, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 177 leon, Johnson County, May 1, 1839, selected for a site Section 10, in Town ship 79 North of Range 6 West of the Fifth Principal Meridian, and immedi ately surveyed it and laid off the town. The first sale of lots took place August 16, 1839. The site selected for the public buildings was a little west of the geographical center of the section, where a square of ten acres on the elevated grounds overlooking the river was reserved for the purpose. The capitol is located in the center of this square. The second Territorial Legislature, which assembled in November, 1839, passed an act requiring the Commissioners to adopt such plan for the building that the aggregate cost when complete should not exceed $51,000, and if they had already adopted a plan involving a greater expenditure they were directed to abandon it. Plans for the building were designed and drawn by Mr. John F. Rague, of Springfield, 111., and on the 4th day of July. 1840, the corner stone of the edifice was laid with appropriate ceremonies. Samuel C. Trowbridge was Marshal of the day, and Gov. Lucas delivered the address on that occasion. When the Legislature assembled at Burlington in special session, July 13, 1840, Gov. Lucas announced that on the 4th of that month he had visited Iowa City, and found the basement of the capitol nearly completed. A bill author izing a loan of $20,000 for the building was passed, January 15, 1841, the unsold lots of Iowa City being the security offered, but only $5,500 was obtained under the act. THE BOUNDARY QUESTION. The boundary line between the Territory of Iowa and the State of Missouri was a difficult question to settle in 1838, in consequence of claims arising from taxes and titles, and at one time civil war was imminent. In defining the boundaries of the counties bordering on Missouri, the Iowa authorities had fixed a line that has since been established as the boundary between Iowa and Mis- souri. The Constitution of Missouri defined her northern boundary to be the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the Des Moines River. The lower rapids of the Mississippi immediately above the mouth of the Des Moines River had always been known as the Des Moines Rapids, or \" the rapids of the Des Moines River.\" The Missourians (evidently not well versed in history or geography) insisted on running the northern boundary line from the rapids in the Des Moines River, just below Keosauqua, thus taking irom Iowa a strip of territory eight or ten miles wide. Assuming this as her northern boundary line, Missouri attempted to exercise jurisdiction over the disputed territory by assessing taxes, and sending her Sheriffs to collect them by distraining the personal property of the settlers. The Iowans, however, were not disposed to submit, and the Missouri officials were arrested by the Sheriffs of Davis and Van Buren Counties and confined in jail. Gov. Boggs, of Missouri, called out his militia to enforce the claim and sustain the officers of Missouri. Gov. Lucas called out the militia of Iowa, and both parties made active preparations for war. In Iowa, about 1,200 men were enlisted, and 500 were actually armed and encamped in Van Buren County, ready to defend the integrity of the Territory. Subsequently, Gen. A. C. Dodge, of Burlington, Gen. Churchman, of Dubuque, and Dr. Clark, of Fort Madison, were sent to Missouri as envoys plenipotentiary, to effect, if possible, a peaceable adj ustment of the difficulty. Upon their arrival, they found that the County Commissioners of Clarke County, Missouri, had rescinded their order for the collection of the taxes, and that Gov. Boggs had despatched messengers to the Governor of Iowa proposing"], [176, "178 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. to submit an agreed case to the Supreme Court of the United States for the final settlement of the boundary question. This proposition was declined, but afterward Congress authorized a suit to settle the controversy, which was insti tuted, and which resulted in a judgment for Iowa. Under this decision, William G. Miner, of Missouri, and Henry B. Hendershott were appointed Commissioners to survey and establish the boundary. Mr. Nourse remarks that \" the expenses of the war on the part of Iowa were never paid, either by the United States or the Territorial Government. The patriots who furnished supplies to the troops had to bear the cost and charges of the struggle.\" The first legislative assembly laid the broad foundation of civil equality, on which has been constructed one of the most liberal governments in the Union. Its first act was to recognize the equality of woman with man before the law by providing that \" no action commenced by a single woman, who intermarries during the pendency thereof, shall abate on account of such marriage.\" This prin ciple has been adopted by all subsequent legislation in Iowa, and to-day woman has full and equal civil rights with man, except only the right of the ballot. Religious toleration was also secured to all, personal liberty strictly guarded, the rights and privileges of citizenship extended to all white persons, and the purity of elections secured by heavy penalties against bribery and corruption. The judiciary power was vested in a Supreme Court, District Court, Probate Court, and Justices of the Peace. Real estate was made divisible by will, and intestate property divided equitably among heirs. Murder was made punishable by death, and proportionate penalties fixed for lesser crimes. A system of free schools, open for every class of white citizens, was established. Provision was made for a system of roads and highways. Thus under the territorial organi zation, the country began to emerge from a savage wilderness, and take on the forms of civil government. By act of Congress of June 12, 1838, the lands which had been purchased of the Indians were brought into market, and land offices opened in Dubuque and Burlington. Congress provided for military roads and bridges, which greatly aided the settlers, who were now coming in by thousands, to make their homes on the fertile prairies of Iowa \u2014 \" the Beautiful Land.\" The fame of the country had spread far and wide ; even before the Indian title was extinguished, many were crowding the borders, impatient to cross over and stake out their claims on the choicest spots they could find in the new Territory. As soon as the country was open for settlement, the borders, the Black Hawk Purchase, all along the Mississipi, and up the principal rivers and streams, and out over the broad and rolling prairies, began to be thronged with eager land hunters and immigrants, seeking homes in Iowa. It was a sight to delight the eyes of all comers from every land \u2014 its noble streams, beautiful and picturesque hills and valleys, broad and fertile prairies extending as far as the eye could reach, with a soil surpassing in richness anything which they had ever seen. It is not to be wondered at that immigration into Iowa was rapid, and that within less than a decade from the organization of the Territory, it contained a hundred and fifty thousand people. As rapidly as the Indian titles were extinguished and the original owners removed, the resistless tide of emigration flowed westward. The following extract from Judge Nourse's Centennial Address shows how the immigrants gathered on the Indian boundary, ready for the removal of the barrier : In obedience to our progressive and aggressive spirit, the Government of the United States made another treaty with the Sac and Fox Indians, on the 11th day of August, 1842, for the remaining portion of their land in Iowa. The treaty provided that the Indians should retain"], [177, "179 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. possession of all the lands thus ceded until May 1, 1843, and should occupy that portion of the \u25a0ceded territory west of a line running north and south through Redrock, until October 11, 1845. These tribes, at this time, had their principal village at Ot-tum-wa-no, now called Ottumwa. As soon as it became known that the treaty had been concluded, there was a rush of immigration to Iowa, and a great number of temporary settlements were made near the Indian boundary, wait ing for the 1st day of May. As the day approached, hundreds of families encamped along the line, and their tents and wagons gave the scene the appearance of a military expedition. The country beyond had been thoroughly explored, but the United States military authorities had prevented any settlement or even the making out of claims by any monuments whatever. To aid them in making out their claims when the hour should arrive, the settlers had placed piles of dry wood on the rising ground, at convenient distances, and a short time before twelve o'clock of the night of the 30th of April, these were lighted, and when the midnight hour arrived, it was announced by the discharge of firearms. The night was dark, but this army of occupa tion pressed forward, torch in hand, with axe and hatchet, blazing lines with all manner of curves and angles. When daylight came and revealed the confusion of these wonderful surveys, numerous disputes arose, settled generally by compromise, but sometimes by violence. Between midnight of the 30th of April and sundown of the 1st of May, over one thousand families had settled on their new purchase. While this scene was transpiring, the retreating Indians were enacting one more impressive and melancholy. The Winter of 1842-43 was one of unusual severity, and the Indian prophet, who had disapproved of the treaty, attributed the severity of the Winter to the anger of the Great Spirit, because they had sold their country. Many religious rites were performed to atone for the crime. When the time for leaving Ot-tum-wa-no arrived, a solemn silence pervaded the Indian camp, and the faces of their stoutest men were bathed in tears; and when their cavalcade was put in motion, toward the setting sun, there was a spontaneous outburst of frantic grief from the entire procession. The Indians remained the appointed time beyond the line running north and south through Redrock. The government established a trading post and military encampment at the Raccoon Fork of the Des Moines River, then and for many years known as Fort Des Moines. Here the red man lingered until the 11th of October, 1845, when the same scene that we have before described was re-enacted, and the wave of immigration swept over the remainder of the \" New Purchase.\" The lands thus occupied and claimed by the settlers still belonged in fee to the Gen eral Government. The surveys were not completed until some time after the Indian title was extinguished. After their survey, the lands were publicly proclaimed or advertised for sale at public auction. Under the laws of the United States, a pre-emption or exclusive right to purchase public lands could net be acquired until after the lands had thus been publicly offered and not sold for want of bidders. Then, and not until then, an occupant making improvements in good faith might acquire a right over others to enter the land at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre. The \" claim laws \" were unknown to the United States statutes. They originated in the \" eternal fitness of things,\" and were enforced, probably, as belonging to that class of natural rights not enumerated in the constitution, and not impaired or disparaged by its enumeration. The settlers organized in every settlement prior to the public land sales, appointed officers, and adopted their own rules and regulations. Each man's claim was duly ascertained and recorded by the Secretary. It was the duty of all to attend the sales. The Secretary bid off the lands of each settler at $1.25 per acre. The others were there, to see, first, that he did his duty and bid in the land, and, secondly, to see that no one else bid. This, of course, sometimes led to trouble, but it saved the excitement of competition, and gave a formality and degree of order and regularity to the proceedings they would not otherwise have attained. As far as practicable, the Territorial Legislature recognized the validity of these \" claims \" upon the public lands, and in 1839 passed an act legalizing their sale and making their transfer a valid consideration to sup port a promise to pay for the same. (Acts of 1843, p. 456). The Supreme Territorial Court held this law to be valid. (See Hill v. Smith, 1st Morris Rep. 70). The opinion not only con tains a decision of the question involved, but also contains much valuable erudition upon that \" spirit of Anglo-Saxon liberty\" which the Iowa settlers unquestionably inherited in a direct line of descent from the said \" Anglo-Saxons.\" But the early settler was not always able to pay even this dollar and twenty-five cents per acre for his land. Many of the settlers had nothing to begin with, save their hands, health and courage and their family jewels, \"the pledges of love,\" and the \"consumers of bread.\" It was not so easy to accumulate money in the early days of the State, and the \"beautiful prairies,\" the \"noble streams,\" and all that sort of poetic imagery, did not prevent the early settlers from becoming discouraged. An old settler, in speaking of the privations and trials of those early days, says : Well do the \"old settlers ' of Iowa remember the days from the first settlement to 1840. Those were days of sadness and distress. The endearments of home in another land had been"], [178, "180 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. broken up ; and all that was hallowed on earth, the home of childhood and the scenes of youth, we severed ; and we sat down by the gentle waters of our noble river, and often \" hung our harps on the willows.\" Another, from another part of the State, testifies : There was no such thing as getting money for any kind of labor. I laid brick at $3.00 per thousand, and took my pay in anything I could eat or wear. I built the first Methodist Church at Keokuk, 42x60 feet, of brick, for S600, and took my pay in a subscription paper, part of which I never collected, and upon which I only received $50 00 in money. Wheat was hauled 100 miles from the interior, and sold for 37i cents per bushel. Another old settler, speaking of a later period, 1843, says : Land and everything had gone down in value to almost nominal prices. Corn and oats could be bought for six or ten cents a bushel ; pork, $1.00 per hundred ; and the best horse a man could raise sold for $50.00. Nearly all were in debt, and the Sheriff and Constable, with legal processes, were common visitors at almost every man's door. These were indeed \"the times that tried men's souls.\" \"A few,\" says Mr. Nourse, \"who were not equal to the trial, returned to their old homes, but such as had the courage and faith to be the worthy founders of a great State remained, to more than realize the fruition of their hopes, and the reward of their self-denial.\" On Monday, December 6, 1841, the fourth Legislative Assembly met, at the new capital, Iowa City, but the capitol building could not be used, and the Legislature occupied a temporary frame house, that had been erected for that purpose, during the session of 1841-2. At this session, the Superintendent of Public Buildings (who, with the Territorial Agent, had superseded the Commis sioners first appointed), estimated the expense of completing the building at $33,330, and that rooms for the use of the Legislature could be completed for $15,600. During 1842, the Superintendent commenced obtaining stone from a new quarry, about ten miles northeast of the city. This is now known as the \" Old Capitol Quarry,\" and contains, it is thought, an immense quantity of excellent building stone. Here all the stone for completing the buildiDg was obtained, and it was so far completed, that on the 5th day of December, 1842, the Legis lature assembled in the new capitol. At this session, the Superintendent esti mated that it would cost $39,143 to finish the building. This was nearly $6,000 higher than the estimate of the previous year, notwithstanding a large sum had been expended in the meantime. This rather discouraging discrep ancy was accounted for by the fact that the officers in charge of the work were constantly short of funds. Except the congressional appropriation of $20,000 and the loan of $5,500, obtained from the Miners' Bank, of Dubuque, all the funds for the prosecution of the work were derived from the sale of the city lots (which did not sell very rapidly), from certificates of indebtedness, and from scrip, based upon unsold lots, which was to be received in payment for such lots when they were sold. At one time, the Superintendent made a requisition for bills of iron and glass, which could not be obtained nearer than St. Louis. To meet this, the Agent sold some lots for a draft, payable at Pittsburgh, Pa., for which he was compelled to pay twenty-five per cent, exchange. This draft, amounting to $507, that officer reported to be more than one-half the cash actually handled by him during the entire season, when the disbursements amounted to very nearly $24,000. With such uncertainty, it could not be expected that estimates could be very accurate. With all these disadvantages, however, the work appears to have been prudently prosecuted, and as rapidly as circumstances would permit."], [179, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 181 Iowa remained a Territory from 1838 to 1846, during which the office of Governor was held by Robert Lucas, John Chambers and James Clarke. STATE ORGANIZATION. By an act of the Territorial Legislature of Iowa, approved February 12, 1844, the question of the formation of a State Constitution and providing for the election of Delegates to a convention to be convened for that purpose was submitted to the people, to be voted upon at their township elections in April following. The vote was largely in favor of the measure, and the Delegates elected assembled in convention at Iowa City, on the 7th of October, 1844. On the first day of November following, the convention completed its work and adopted the first State Constitution. The President of the convention, Hon. Shepherd Leffler, was instructed to transmit a certified copy of this Constitution to the Delegate in Congress, to be by him submitted to that body at the earliest practicable day. It was also pro vided that it should be submitted, together with any conditions or changes that might be made by Congress, to the people of the Territory, for their approval or rejection, at the township election in April, 1845. The boundaries of the State, as defined by this Constitution, were as fol lows : Beginning in the middle of the channel of the Mississippi River, opposite mouth of the Des Moines River, thence up the said river Des Moines, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to a point where it is intersected by the Old Indian Boundary line, or line run by John C. Sullivan, in the year 1816 ; thence westwardly along said line to the \" old \" northwest corner of Missouri ; thence due west to the middle of the main channel of the Missouri River ; thence up in the middle of the main channel of the river last mentioned to the mouth of the Sioux or Calumet River ; thence in a direct line to the middle of the main channel of the St. Peters River, where the Watonwan River \u2014 according to Nicollet's map \u2014 enters the same ; thence down the middle of the main channel of said river to the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi River ; thence down the middle of the main channel of said river to the place of beginning. These boundaries were rejected by Congress, but by act approved March 3, 1845, a State called Iowa was admitted into the Union, provided the people accepted the act, bounded as follows : Beginning at the mouth of the Des Moines River, at the middle of the Mississippi, thence by the middle ol the channel of that river to a parallel of latitude passing through the mouth of the Mankato or Blue Earth River; thence west, along said parallel of latitude, to a point where it is intersected by a meridian line seventeen degrees and thirty minutes west of the meridian of Washington City ; thence due south, to the northern boundary line of the State of Missouri; thence eastwardly, following that boundary to the point at which the same intersects the Des Moines River ; thence by the middle of the channel of that river to the place of beginning. These boundaries, had they been accepted, would have placed the northern boundary of the State about thirty miles north of its present location, and would have deprived it of the Missouri slope and the boundary of that river. The western boundary would have been near the west line of what is now Kossuth County. But it was not so to be. In consequence of this radical and unwel come change in the boundaries, the people refused to accept the act of Congress and rejected the Constitution at the election, held August 4, 1845, by a vote of 7,656 to 7,235. A second Constitutional Convention assembled at Iowa City on the 4th day of May, 1846, and on the 18th of the same month another Constitution for the new State with the present boundaries, was adopted and submitted to the people for ratification on the 3d day of August following, when it was accepted ; 9,492 votes were cast \"for the Constitution,\" and 9,036 \"against the Constitution \""], [180, "182 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. The Constitution was approved by Congress, and by act of Congress approved December 28, 1846, Iowa was admitted as a sovereign State in the American Union. Prior to this action of Congress, however, the people of the new State held an election under the new Constitution on the 26 th day of October, and elected Oresel Briggs, Governor ; Elisha Cutler, Jr., Secretary of State ; Joseph T. Fales, Auditor ; Morgan Reno, Treasurer ; and members of the Senate and House of Representatives. At this time there were twenty-seven organized counties in the State, with a population of nearly 100,000, and the frontier settlements were rapidly push ing toward the Missouri River. The Mormons had already reached there. The first General Assembly of the State of Iowa was composed of nineteen Senators and forty Representatives. It assembled at Iowa City, November 30, 1846, about a month before the State was admitted into the Union. At the first session of the State Legislature, the Treasurer of State reported that the capitol building was in a very exposed condition, liable to injury from storms, and expressed the hope that some provision would be made to complete it, at least sufficiently to protect it from the weather. The General Assembly responded by appropriating $2,500 for the completion of the public buildings. At the first session also arose the question of the re-location of the capital. The western boundary of the State, as now determined, left Iowa City too far toward the eastern and southern boundary of the State ; this was conceded. Congress had appropriated five sections of land for the erection of public buildings, and toward the close of the session a bill was introduced providing for the re-location of the seat of government, involving to some extent the location of the State University, which had already been discussed. This bill gave rise to a deal of discussion and parliamentary maneuvering, almost purely sectional in its character. It provided for the appointment of three Commissioners, who were authorized to make a location as near the geographical center of the State as a healthy and eligible site could be obtained ; to select the five sections of land donated by Congress ; to survey and plat into town lots not exceeding one section of the land so selected ; to sell lots at public sale, not to exceed two in each block. Having done this, they were then required to suspend further operations, and make a report of their proceedings to the Governor. The bill passed both Houses by decisive votes, received the signature of the Governor, and became a law. Soon after, by \" An act to locate and establish a State University,\" approved February 25, 1847, the unfinished public buildings at Iowa City, together with the ten acres of land on which they were situated, were granted for the use of the University, reserving their use, however, by the General Assembly and the State officers, until other provisions were made by law. The Commissioners forthwith entered upon their duties, and selected four sections and two half sections in Jasper County. Two of these sections are in what is now Des Moines Township, and the others in Fairview Township, in the southern part of that county. These lands are situated between Prairie City and Monroe, on the Keokuk & Des Moines Railroad, which runs diagonally through them. Here a town was platted, called Monroe City, and a sale of lots took place. Four hundred and fifteen lots were sold, at prices that were not considered remarkably remunerative. The cash payments (one-fourth) amounted to $1,797.43, while the expenses of the sale and the claims of the Commissioners for services amounted to $2,206.57. The Commissioners made a report of their proceedings to the Governor, as required by law, but the loca tion was generally condemned."], [181, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 183 \"When the report of the Commissioners, showing this brilliant financial ope ration, had been read in the House of Representatives, at the next session, and while it was under consideration, an indignant member, afterward known as the eccentric Judge McFarland, moved to refer the report to a select Committee of Five, with instructions to report \" how much of said city of Monroe was under water and how much was burned.\" The report was referred, without the instructions, however, but Monroe City never became the seat of government. By an act approved January 15, 1849, the law by which the location had been made was repealed and the new town was vacated, the money paid by purchas ers of lots being refunded to them. This, of course, retained the seat of govern ment at Iowa City, and precluded, for the time, the occupation of the building and grounds by the University. At the same session, $3,000 more were appropriated for completing the State building at Iowa City. In 1852, the further sum of $5,000, and in 1854 $4,000 more were apppropriated for the same purpose, making the whole cost $123,000, paid partly by the General Government and partly by the State, but principally from the proceeds of the sale of lots in Iowa City. But the question of the permanent location of the seat of government was not settled, and in 1851 bills were introduced for the removal of the capital to Pella and to Fort Des Moines. The latter appeared to have the support of the majority, but was finally lost in the House on the question of ordering it to its third reading. At the next session, in 1853, a bill was introduced in the Senate for the removal of the seat of government to Fort Des Moines, and, on final vote, was just barely defeated. At the next session, however, the effort was more successful, and on the 15th day of January, 1855, a bill re-locating the capital within two miles of the Raccoon Fork of the Des Moines, and for the appoint ment of Commissioners, was approved by Gov. Grimes. The site was selected in 1856, in accordance with the provisions of this act, the land being donated to the State by citizens and property-holders of Des Moines. An association of citizens erected a building for a temporary capitol, and leased it to the State at a nominal rent. The third Constitutional Convention to revise the Constitution of the State assembled at Iowa City, January 19, 1857. The new Constitution framed by this convention was submitted to the people at an election held August 3, 1857, when it was approved and adopted by a vote of 40,311 \" for \" to 38,681 \" against,\" and on the 3d day of September following was declared by a procla mation of the Governor to be the supreme law of the State of Iowa. Advised of the completion of the temporary State House at Des Moines, on the 19th of October following, Governor Grimes issued another proclamation, declaring the City of Des Moines to be the capital of the State of Iowa. The removal of the archives and offices was commenced at once and con tinued through the Fall. It was an undertaking of no small magnitude ; there was not a mile of railroad to facilitate the work, and the season was unusually disagreeable. Rain, snow and other accompaniments increased the difficulties ; and it was not until December, that the last of the effects \u2014 the safe of the State Treasurer, loaded on two large \" bob-sleds \" \u2014 drawn by ten yoke of oxen was de posited in the new capital. It is not imprudent now to remark that, during this passage over hills and prairies, across rivers, through bottom lands and timber, the safes belonging to the several departments contained large sums of money, mostly individual funds, however. Thus, Iowa City ceased to be the capital of the State, after four Territorial Legislatures, six State Legislatures and three"], [182, "184 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Constitutional Conventions had held their sessions there. By the exchange, the old capitol at Iowa City became the seat of the University, and, except the rooms occupied by the United States District Court, passed under the immedi ate and direct control of the Trustees of that institution. Des Moines was now the permanent seat of government, made so by the fundamental law of the State, and on the 11th day of January, 1858, the seventh General Assembly convened at the new capital. The building used for governmental purposes was purchased in 1864. It soon became inadequate for the purposes for which it was designed, and it became apparent that a new, large and permanent State House must be erected. In 1870, the General Assembly made an appropriation and provided for the appointment of a Board of Commissioners to commence the work. The board consisted of Gov. Samuel Merrill, ex officio, President ; Grenville M. Dodge, Council Bluffs ; James F. Wilson, Fairfield; James Dawson, Washington; Simon G. Stein, Muscatine ; James 0. Crosby, Gainsville ; Charles Dudley, Agency City ; John N. Dewey, Des Moines ; William L. Joy, Sioux City ; Alexander R. Fulton, Des Moines, Secretary. The act of 1870 provided that the building should be constructed of the best material and should be fire proof; to be heated and ventilated in the most approved manner; should contain suitable legislative halls, rooms for State officers, the judiciary, library, committees, archives and the collections of the State Agricultural Society, and for all purpoees of State Government, and should be erected on grounds held by the State for that purpose. The sum first appropriated was $150,000 ; and the law provided that no contract should be made, either for constructing or furnishing the building, which should bind the State for larger sums than those at the time appropriated. A design was drawn and plans and specifications furnished by Cochrane & Piquenard, architects, which were accepted by the board, and on the 23d of November, 1871, the cor ner stone was laid with appropriate ceremonies. The estimated cost and present value of the capitol is fixed at $2,000,000. From 1858 to 1860, the Sioux became troublesome in the northwestern part of the State. These warlike Indians made frequent plundering raids upon the settlers, and murdered several families. In 1861, several companies of militia were ordered to that portion of the State to hunt down and punish the murderous thieves. No battles were fought, however, for the Indians fled when they ascertained that systematic and adequate measures had been adopted to protect the settlers. \" The year 1856 marked a new era in the history of Iowa. In 1854, the Chicago & Rock Island Railroad had been completed to the east bank of the Mississippi River, opposite Davenport. In 1854, the corner stone of a railroad bridge, that was to he the first to span the \"Father of Waters,\" was laid with appropriate ceremonies at this point. St. Louis had resolved that the enter prise was unconstitutional, and by writs of injunction made an unsuccessful effort to prevent its completion. Twenty years later in her history, St. Louis repented her folly, and made atonement for her sin by imitating our example. On the 1st day of January, 1856, this railroad was completed to Iowa City. In the meantime, two other railroads had reached the east bank of the Missis sippi \u2014 one opposite Burlington, and one opposite Dubuque\u2014 and these were being extended into the interior of the State. Indeed, four lines of railroad had been projected across the State from the Mississippi to the Missouri, hav ing eastern connections. On the 15th of May, 1856, the Congress of the United States passed an act granting to the State, to aid in the construction of"], [183, "185 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. railroads, the public lands in alternate sections, six miles on either side of the proposed lines. An extra session of the General Assembly was called in July of this year, that disposed of the grant to the several companies that proposed to complete these enterprises. The population of our State at this time had increased to 500,000. Public attention had been called to the necessity of a railroad across the continent. The position of Iowa, in the very heart and center of the Republic, on the route of this great highway across the continent, began to attract attention Cities and towns sprang up through the State as if by magic. Capital began to pour into the State, and had it been employed in developing our vast coal measures and establishing manufactories among us, or if it had been expended in improving our lands, and building houses and barns, it would have been well. But all were in haste to get rich, and the spirit of speculation ruled the hour. \" In the meantime, every effort was made to help the speedy completion of the railroads. Nearly every county and city on the Mississippi, and many in the interior, voted large corporate subscriptions to the stock of the railroad companies, and issued their negotiable bonds for the amount.\" Thus enormous county and city debts were incurred, the payment of which these municipalities tried to avoid upon the plea that they had exceeded the constitutional limit ation of their powers. The Supreme Court of the United States held these bonds to be valid ; and the courts by mandamus compelled the city and county authorities to levy taxes to pay the judgments. These debts are not all paid even yet, but the worst is over and ultimately the burden will be entirely removed The first railroad across the State was completed to Council Bluffs in Jan uary, 1871. The others were completed soon after. In 1854, there was not a mile of railroad in the State. In 1874, twenty years after, there were 3,765 miles in successful operation. GROWTH AND PROGRESS. When Wisconsin Territory was organized, in 1836, the entire population of that portion of the Territory now embraced in the State of Iowa was 10,531. The Territory then embraced two counties, Dubuque and Des Moines, erected by the Territory of Michigan, in 1834. From 1836 to 1838, the Territorial Legislature of Wisconsin increased the number of counties to sixteen, and the population had increased to 22,859. Since then, the counties have increased to ninety-nine, and the population, in 1875, was 1,366,000. The following table will show the population at different periods since the erection of Iowa Territory : Year. Population. I Year. Population. Year.

Not only in popula tion, but in everything contributing to the growth and greatness of a State has Iowa made rapid progress. In a little more than thirty years, its wild but beautiful prairies have advanced from the home of the savage to a highly civ ilized commonwealth, embracing all the elements of progress which characterize the older States."], [184, "186 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Thriving cities and towns dot its fair surface ; an iron net-work of thou sands of miles of railroads is woven over its broad acres ; ten thousand school houses, in which more than five hundred thousand children are being taught the rudiments of education, testify to the culture and liberality of the people; high schools, colleges and universities are generously endowed by the State ; manufactories spring up on all her water courses, and in most of her cities and towns. Whether measured from the date of her first settlement, her organization as a Territory or admission as a State, Iowa has thus far shown a growth unsur passed, in a similar period, by any commonwealth on the face of the earth ; and, with her vast extent of fertile soil, with her inexhaustible treasures of mineral wealth, with a healthful, invigorating climate ; an intelligent, liberty loving people ; with equal, just and liberal laws, and her free schools, the future of Iowa may be expected to surpass the most hopeful anticipations of her present citizens. Looking upon Iowa as she is to-day \u2014 populous, prosperous and happy \u2014 it is hard to realize the wonderful changes that have occurred since the first white settlements were made within her borders. When the number of States was only twenty-six, and their total population about twenty millions, our repub lican form of government was hardly more than an experiment, just fairly put upon trial. The development of our agricultural resources and inexhaustible mineral wealth had hardly commenced. Westward the \" Star of Empire \" had scarcely started on its way. West of the great Mississippi was a mighty empire, but almost unknown, and marked on the maps of the period as \" The Great American Desert.\" Now, thirty-eight stars glitter on our national escutcheon, and forty-five millions of people, who know their rights and dare maintain them, tread American soil, and the grand sisterhood of States extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border, and from the rocky coast of the Atlantic to the golden shores of the Pacific. THE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE AND FARM. Ames, Story County. The Iowa State Agricultural College and Farm were established by au act of the General Assembly, approved March 22, 1858. A Board of Trustees was appointed, consisting of Governor R. P. Lowe, John D. Wright, William Duane Wilson, M. W. Robinson, Timothy Day, Richard Gaines, John Pattee, G. W. F. Sherwin, Suel Foster, S. W. Henderson, Clement Coffin and E. G. Day ; the Governors of the State and President of the College being ex officio mem bers. Subsequently the number of Trustees was reduced to five. The Board met in June, 1859, and received propositions for the location of the College and Farm from Hardin, Polk, Story and Boone, Marshall, Jefferson and Tama Counties. In July, the proposition of Story County and some of its citizens and by the citizens of Boone County was accepted, and the farm and the site for the buildings were located. In 1860-61, the farm-house and barn were erected. In 1862, Congress granted to the State 240,000 acres of land for the endowment of schools of agriculture and the mechanical arts, and 195,000 acres were located by Peter Melendy, Commissioner, in 1862-3. George W. Bassett was appointed Land Agent for the institution. In 1864, the General Assem bly appropriated $20,000 for the erection of the college building."], [185, "187 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. In June of that year, the Building Committee, consisting of Suel Foster, Peter Melendy and A. J. Bronson, proceeded to let the contract. John Browne, of Des Moines, was employed as architect, and furnished the plans of the build ing, but was superseded in its construction by C. A. Dunham. The $20,000 appropriated by the General Assembly were expended in putting in the foun dations and making the brick for the structure. An additional appropriation of $91,000 was made in 1866, and the building was completed in 1868. Tuition in this college is made by law forever free to pupils from the State over sixteen years of age, who have been resident of the State six months pre vious to their admission. Each county in the State has a prior right of tuition for three scholars from each county ; the remainder, equal to the capacity of the college, are by the Trustees distributed among the counties in proportion to the population, and subject to the above rule. All sale of ardent spirits, wine or beer are prohibited by law within a distance of three miles from the college, except for sacramental, mechanical or medical purposes. The course of instruction in the Agricultural College embraces the following branches: Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Botany, Horticulture, Fruit Growing, Forestry, Animal and Vegetable Anatomy, Geology, Mineralogy, Meteorology, Entomology, Zoology, the Veterinary Art, Plane Mensuration, Leveling, Sur veying, Bookkeeping, and such Mechanical Arts as are directly connected with agriculture ; also such other studies as the Trustees may from time to time prescribe, not inconsistent with the purposes of the institution. The funds arising from the lease and sale of lands and interest on invest ments are sufficient for the support of the institution. Several College Societies are maintained among the students, who publish a monthly paper. There is also an \"\u2022out-law \" called the u ATA, Chapter Omega.\" The Board of Trustees in 1877 was composed of C. W. Warden, Ottumwa, Chairman ; Hon. Samuel J. Kirkwood, Iowa City ; William B.

In the famous Ordinance of 1787, enacted by Congress before the Territory of the United States extended beyond the Mississippi River, it was declared that in all the territory northwest of the Ohio River, \" Schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" By act of Congress, approved July 20, 1840, the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized \" to set apart and re serve from sale, out of any of the public lands within the Territory of Iowa, to which the Indian title has been or may be extinguished, and not otherwise ap propriated, a quantity of land, not exceeding the entire townships, for the use"], [186, "188 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. and support of a university within said Territorry when it becomes a State, and for no other use or purpose whatever ; to be located in tracts of not less than an entire section, corresponding with any of the large divisions into which the pub lic land are authorized to be surveyed.\" William W. Dodge, of Scott County, was appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to make the selections. He selected Section 5 in Township 78, north of Range 3, east of the Fifth Principal Meridian, and then removed from the Territory. No more lands were selected until 1846, when, at the request of the Assembly, John M. Whitaker of Van Buren County, was appointed, who selected the remainder of the grant except about 122 acres. In the first Constitution, under which Iowa was admitted to the Union, the people directed the disposition of the proceeds of this munificent grant in ac cordance with its terms, and instructed the General Assembly to provide, as soon as may be, effectual means for the improvement and permanent security of the funds of the university derived from the lands. The first General Assembly, by act approved February 25, 1847, established the \" State University of Iowa \" at Iowa City, then the capital of the State, \"with such other branches as public convenience may hereafter require.\" The \" public buildings at Iowa City, together with the ten acres of land in which they are situated,\" were granted for the use of said university, provided, how ever, that the sessions of the Legislature and State offices should be held in the capitol until otherwise provided by law. The control and management of the University were committed to a board of fifteen Trustees, to be appointed by the Legislature, five of whom were to be chosen bienially. The Superintendent of Public Instruction was made President of this Board. Provisions were made for the disposal of the two townships of land, and for the investment of the funds arising therefrom. The act further provides that the University shall never be under the exclusive control of any religious denomination whatever,\" and as soon as the revenue for the grant and donations amounts to $2,000 a year, the University should commence and continue the instruction, free of charge, of fifty students annually. The General Assembly retained full supervision over the University, its officers and the grants and donations made and to be made to it by the State. Section 5 of the act appointed James P. Carleton, H. D. Downey, Thomas Snyder, Samuel McCrory, Curtis Bates, Silas Foster, E. C. Lyon, James H. Gower, George G. Vincent, Wm. G. Woodward, Theodore S. Parvin, George Atchinson, S. G. Matson, H. W. Starr and Ansel Briggs, the first Board of Trustees. The organization of the University at Iowa City was impracticable, how ever, so long as the seat of government was retained there. In January, 1849, two branches of the University and three Normal Schools were established. The branches were located \u2014 one at Fairfield, and the other at Dubuque, and were placed upon an equal footing, in respect to funds and all other matters, with the University established at Iowa City \"This act,\" says Col. Benton, \"created three State Universities, with equal rights and powers, instead of a 'University with such branches as public conven ience may hereafter demand,' as provided by the Constitution.\" The Board of Directors of the Fairfield Branch consisted of Barnet Ris tine, Christian W. Slagle, Daniel Rider, Horace Gaylord, Bernhart Henn and Samuel S. Bayard. At the first meeting of the Board, Mr. Henn was elected President, Mr. Slagle Secretary, and Mr. Gaylord Treasurer. Twenty acres of land were purchased, and a building erected thereon, costing $2,500."], [187, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 189 This building was nearly destroyed by a hurricane, in 1850, but was rebuilt more substantially, all by contributions of the citizens of Fairfield. This branch never received any aid from the State or from the University Fund, and by act approved January 24, 1853, at the request of the Board, the Gen eral Assembly terminated its relation to the State. The branch at Dubuque was placed under the control of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and John King, Caleb H. Booth, James M. Emerson, Michael J. Sullivan, Richard Benson and the Governor of the State as Trustees. The Trustees never organized, and its existence was only nominal. The Normal Schools were located at Andrew, Oskaloosa and Mount Pleasant, respectively. Each was to be governed by a board of seven Trustees, to be appointed by the Trustees of the University. Each was to receive $500 annu ally from the income of the University Fund, upon condition that they should ed ucate eight common school teachers, free of charge for tuition, and that the citizens should contribute an equal sum for the erection of the requisite buildings. The several Boards of Trustees were appointed. At Andrew, the school was organized Nov. 21, 1849; Samuel Ray, Principal; Miss J. S. Dorr, Assist ant. A building was commenced and over $1,000 expended on it, but it was never completed. At Oskaloosa, the Trustees organized in April, 1852. This school was opened in the Court House, September 13, 1852, under the charge of Prof. G. M. Drake and wife. A two story brick building was completed in 1853, costing $2,473. The school at Mount Pleasant was never organized. Neither of these schools received any aid from the University Fund, but in 1857 the Legislature appropriated $1,000 each for those at Oskaloosa and Andrew, and repealed the law authorizing the payment of money to them from the University Fund. From that time they made no further effort to continue in operation. At a special meeting of the Board of Trustees, held February 21, 1850, the \" College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Upper Mississippi,\" established at Davenport, was recognized as the \" College of Physicians and Surgeons of the State University of Iowa,\" expressly stipulating, however, that such recog nition should not render the University liable for any pecuniary aid, nor was the Board to have any control over the property or management of the Medical Association. Soon after, this College was removed to Keokuk, its second ses sion being opened there in November, 1850. In 1851, the General Assembly confirmed the action of the Board, and by act approved January 22, 1855, placed the Medical College under the supervision of the Board of Trustees of the University, and it continued in operation until this arrangement was termi nated by the new Constitution, September 3, 1857. From 1847 to 1855, the Board of Trustees was kept full by regular elec tions by the Legislature, and the Trustees held frequent meetings, but there was no effectual organization of the University. In March, 1855, it was partially opened for a term of sixteen weeks. July 16, 1855, Amos Dean, of Albany, N. Y., was elected President, but he never entered fully upon its duties. The University was again opened in September, 1855, and continued in operation until June, 1856, under Professors Johnson, Welton, Van Valkenburg and Guffin. In the Spring of 1856, the capital of the State was located at Des Moines; but there were no buildings there, and the capitol at Iowa City was not vacated by the State until December, 1857. In June, 1856, the faculty was re-organized, with some changes, and the University was again opened on the third Wednesday of September, 1856."], [188, "190 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. There were one hundred and twenty-four students \u2014 eighty-three males and forty-one females \u2014 in attendance during the year 1856-7, and the first regular catalogue was published. At a special meeting of the Board, September 22, 1857, the honorary de gree of Bachelor of Arts was conferred on D. Franklin Wells. This was the first degree conferred by the Board. Article IX, Section 11, of the new State Constitution, which went into force September 3, 1857, provided as follows : The State University shall be established at one place, without branches at any other place ; and the University fund shall be applied to that institution, and no other. Article XI, Section 8, provided that The seat of Government is hereby permanently established, as now fixed by law, at the city of Des Moines, in the county of Polk ; and the State University at Iowa City, in the county of Johnson. The new Constitution created the Board of Education, consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, who was ex officio President, and one member to be elected from each judicial district in the State. This Board was endowed with \" full power and authority to legislate and make all needful rules and regula tions in relation to common schools and other educational institutions,\" subject to alteration, amendment or repeal by the General Assembly, which was vested with authority to abolish or re-organize the Board at any time after 1863. In December, 1857, the old capitol building, now known as Central Hall of the University, except the rooms occupied by the United States District Court, and the property, with that exception, passed under the control of the Trustees, and became the seat of the University. The old building had had hard usage, and its arrangement was illy adapted for University purposes. Extensive repairs and changes were necessary, but the Board was without funds for these pur poses. The last meeting of the Board, under the old law, was held in January, 1858. At this meeting, a resolution was introduced, and seriously considered, to exclude females from the University ; but it finally failed. March 12, 1858, the first Legislature under the new Constitution enacted a new law in relation to the University, but it was not materially different from the former. March 11, 1858, the Legislature appropriated $3,000 for the re pair and modification of the old capitol building, and $10,000 for the erection of a boarding house, now known as South Hall. The Board of Trustees created by the new law met and duly organized April 27, 1858, and determined to close the University until the income from its fund should be adequate to meet the current expenses, and the buildings should be ready for occupation. Until this term, the building known as the \" Mechan ics' Academy\" had been used for the school. The Faculty, except the Chan cellor (Dean), was dismissed, and all further instruction suspended, from the close of the term then in progress until September, 1859. At this meeting, a reso lution was adopted excluding females from the University after the close of the existing term ; but this was afterward, in August, modified, so as to admit them to the Normal Department. At the meeting of the Board, August 4, 1858, the degree of Bachelor of Science was conferred upon Dexter Edson Smith, being the first degree con ferred upon a student of the University. Diplomas were awarded to the mem bers of the first graduating class of the Normal Department as follows : Levi P. Aylworth, Cellina H. Aylworth, Elizabeth L. Humphrey, Annie A. Pinney and Sylvia M. Thompson."], [189, "191 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. An \"Act for the Government and Regulation of the State University of Iowa,\" approved December 25, 1858, was mainly a re-enactment of the law of March 12, 1858, except that changes were made in the Board of Trustees, and manner of their appointment. This law provided that both sexes were to be admitted on equal terms to all departments of the institution, leaving the Board no discretion in the matter. The new Board met and organized, February 2, 1859, and decided to con tinue the Normal Department only to the end of the current term, and that it was unwise to re-open the University at that time ; but at the annual meeting of the Board, in June of the same year, it was resolved to continue the Normal Department in operation ; and at a special meeting, October 25, 1859, it was decided to re-open the University in September, 1860. Mr. Dean had resigned as Chancellor prior to this meeting, and Silas Totten, D. D., LL. D., was elected President, at a salary of $2,000, and his term commenced June, 1860. At the annual meeting, June 28, 1860, a full Faculty was appointed, and the University re-opened, under this new organization, September 19, 1860 (third Wednesday) ; and at this date the actual existence of the University may be said to commence. August 19, 1862, Dr. Totten having resigned, Prof. Oliver M. Spencer was elected President and the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon Judge Samuel F. Miller, of Keokuk. At the commencement, in June, 1863, was the first class of graduates in the Collegiate Department. The Board of Education was abolished March 19, 1864, and the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction was restored ; the General Assembly resumed control of the subject of education, and on March 21, an act was ap- proved for the government of the University. It was substantially the same as the former law, but provided that the Governor should be ex officio President of the Board of Trustees. Until 1858, the Superintendent of Public Instruction had been ex officio President. During the period of the Board of Education, the University Trustees were elected by it, and elected their own President. President Spencer was granted leave of absence from April 10, 1866, for fifteen months, to visit Europe; and Prof. Nathan R. Leonard was elected President pro tern. The North Hall was completed late in 1866. At the annual meeting in June, 1867, the resignation of President Spencer (absent in Europe) was accepted, and Prof. Leonard continued as President pro tern., until March 4, 1868, when James Black, D. D., Vice President of Wash- ington and Jefferson College, Penn., was elected President. Dr. Black entered upon his duties in September, 1868. The Law Department was established in June, 1868, and, in September fol- lowing, an arrangement was perfected with the Iowa Law School, at Des Moines, which had been in successful operation for three years, under the management of Messrs. George G. Wright, Chester C. Cole and William G. Hammond, by which that institution was transferred to Iowa City and merged in the Law De- partment of the University. The Faculty of this department consisted of the President of the University, Hon. Wm. G. Hammond, Resident Professor and Principal of the Department, and Professors G. G. Wright and C. C. Cole. Nine students entered at the commencement of the first term, and during the year ending June, 1877, there were 103 students in this department. At a special meeting of the Board, on the 17th of September, 1868, a Com mittee was appointed to consider the expediency of establishing a Medical De-"], [190, "192 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. partment. This Committee reported at once in favor of the proposition, the Faculty to consist of the President of the University and seven Professors, and recommended that, if practicable, the new department should be opened at the commencement of the University year, in 1869-70. At this meeting, Hon. Ezekiel Clark was elected Treasurer of the University. By an act of the General Assembly, approved April 11, 1870, the \"Board of Regents \" was instituted as the governing power of the University, and since that time it has been the fundamental law of the institution. The Board of Regents held its first meeting June 28, 1870. Wm. J. Haddock was elected Secretary, and Mr. Clark, Treasurer. Dr. Black tendered his resignation as President, at a special meeting of the Board, held August 18, 1870, to take effect on the 1st of December following. His resignation was accepted. The South Hall having been fitted up for the purpose, the first term of the Medical Department was opened October 24, 1870, and continued until March, 1871, at which time there were three graduates and thirty-nine students. March 1, 1871, Rev. George Thacher was elected President of the Univer sity. Mr. Thacher accepted, entered upon his duties April 1st, and was form ally inaugurated at the annual meeting in June, 1861. In June, 1874, the \" Chair of Military Instruction\" was established, and the President of the United States was requested to detail an officer to perform its duties. In compliance with this request, Lieut. A. D. Schenck, Second Artil lery, U. S. A., was detailed as \"Professor of Military Science and Tactics,\" at Iowa State University, by order of the War Department, August 26, 1874, who reported for duty on the 10th of September following. Lieut. Schenck was relieved by Lieut. James Chester, Third Artillery, January 1, 1877. Treasurer Clark resigned November 3, 1875, and John N. Coldren elected in his stead. At the annual meeting, in 1876, a Department of Hom\u0153opathy was established. In March, 1877, a resolution was adopted affiliating the High Schools of the State with the University. In June, 1877, Dr. Thacher's connection with the University was termi nated, and C. W. Slagle, a member of the Board of Regents, was elected Pres ident. In 1872, the ex officio membership of the Superintendent of Public Instruc tion was abolished ; but it was restored in 1876.

STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. By act of the General Assembly,*approved January 28, 1857, a State His- torical Society was provided for in connection with the University. At the commencement, an appropriation of $250 was made, to be expended in collecting, embodying, and preserving in an authentic form a library of books, pamphlets, charts, maps, manuscripts, papers, paintings, statuary, and other materials illus- trative of the history of Iowa; and with the further object to rescue from oblivion the memory of the early pioneers ; to obtain and preserve various accounts of their exploits, perils and hardy adventures ; to secure facts and statements relative to the history and genius, and progress and decay of the Indian tribes of Iowa; to exhibit faithfully the antiquities and past and present resources of the State ; to aid in the publication of such collections of the Society as shall from time to time be deemed of value and interest ; to aid in binding its books, pamphlets, manuscripts and papers, and in defraying other necessary incidental expenses of the Society. There was appropriated by law to this institution, till the General Assembly shall otherwise direct, the sum of $500 per annum. The Society is under the management of a Board of Curators, consisting of eighteen persons, nine of whom are appointed by the Governor, and nine elected by the members of the Society. The Curators receive no compensation for their services. The annual"], [192, "194 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. meeting is provided for by law, to be held at Iowa City on Monday preceding the last Wednesday in June of each year. The State Historical Society has published a series of very valuable collec tions, including history, biography, sketches, reminiscences, etc., with quite a large number of finely engraved portraits of prominent and early settlers, under the title of \" Annals of Iowa.\" THE PENITENTIARY. Located at Fort Madison, Lee County. The first act of the Territorial Legislature, relating to a Penitentiary in Iowa, was approved January 25, 1839, the fifth section of which authorized the Governor to draw the sum of $20,000 appropriated by an act of Congress ap proved July 7, 1838, for public buildings in the Territory of Iowa. It provided for a Board of Directors of three persons elected by the Legislature, who should direct the building of the Penitentiary, which should be located within one mile of the public square, in the town of Fort Madison, Lee County, provided Fort Madison should deed to the directors a tract of land suitable for a site, and assign them, by contract, a spring or stream of water for the use of the Penitentiary. To the Directors was also given the power of appointing the Warden ; the latter to appoint his own assistants. The first Directors appointed were John S. David and John Claypole. They made their first report to the Legislative Council November 9, 1839. The citi zens of the town of Fort Madison had executed a deed conveying ten acres of land for the building site. Amos Ladd was appointed Superintendent of the building June 5, 1839. The building was designed of sufficient capacity to con tain one hundred and thirty-eight convicts, and estimated to cost $55,933.90. It was begun on the 9th of July, 1839 ; the main building and Warden's house were completed in the Fall of 1841. Other additions were made from time to time till the building and arrangements were all complete according to the plan of the Directors. It has answered the purpose of the State as a Penitentiary for more than thirty years, and during that period many items of practical ex perience in prison management have been gained. It has long been a problem how to conduct prisons, and deal with what are called the criminal classes generally, so as to secure their best good and best subserve the interests of the State. Both objects must be taken into considera tion in any humaritarian view of the subject. This problem is not yet solved, but Iowa has adopted the progressive and enlightened policy of humane treat ment of prisoners and the utilization of their labor for their own support. The labor of the convicts in the Iowa Penitentiary, as in most others in the United States, is let out to contractors, who pay the State a certain stipulated amount therefor, the State furnishing the shops, tools and machinery, as weld as the supervision necessary to preserve order and discipline in the prison. While this is an improvement upon the old solitary confinement system, it still falls short of an enlightened reformatory system that in the future will treat the criminal for mental disease and endeavor to restore him to usefulness in the community. The objections urged against the contract system of dis posing of the labor of prisoners, that it brings the labor of honest citizens into competition with convict labor at reduced prices, and is disadvantageous to the State, are not without force, and the system will have no place in the prisons of the future. ,"], [193, "195 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. It is right that the convict should labor. He should not be allowed to live in idleness at public expense. Honest men labor ; why should not they? Hon est men are entitled to the fruits of their toil ; why should not the convict as well ? The convict is sent to the Penitentiary to secure public safety. The State deprives him of his liberty to accomplish this purpose and to punish him for violations of law, but, having done this, the State wrongs both itself and the criminal by confiscating his earnings ; because it deprives his family of what justly belongs to them, and an enlightened civilization will ere long demand that the prisoner in the penitentiary, after paying a fair price for his board, is as justly entitled to his net earnings as the good citizen outside its walls, and his family, if he has one, should be entitled to draw his earnings or stated portion of them at stated periods. If he has no family, then if his net earnings should be set aside to his credit and paid over to him at the expiration of his term of imprisonment, he would not be turned out upon the cold charities of a somewhat pharisaical world, penniless, with the brand of the convict upon his brow, with no resource save to sink still deeper in crime. Let Iowa, \" The Beautiful Land,\" be first to recognize the rights of its convicts to the fruits of their labor ; keep their children from the alms-house, and place a powerful incentive before them to become good citizens when they return to the busy world again. ADDITIONAL PENITENTIARY. Located at Anamosa, Jones County. By an act of the Fourteenth General Assembly, approved April 23, 1872, William Ure, Foster L. Downing and Martin Heisey were constituted Commis sioners to locate and provide for the erection and control of an additional Penitentiary for the State of Iowa. These Commissioners met on the 4th of the following June, at Anamosa, Jones County, and selected a site donated by the citizens, within the limits of the city. L. W. Foster & Co., architects, of Des Moines, furnished the plan, drawings and specifications, and work was commenced on the building on the 28th day of September, 1872. May 13, 1873, twenty convicts were transferred to Anamosa from the Fort Madison Penitentiary. The entire enclosure includes fifteen acres, with a frontage of 663 feet. IOWA HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE. Mount Pleasant, Henry County. By an act of the General Assembly of Iowa, approved January 24, 1855, $4,425 were appropriated for the purchase of a site, and $50,000 for building an Insane Hospital, and the Governor (Grimes), Edward Johnston, of Lee County, and Charles S. Blake, of Henry County, were appointed to locate the institution and superintend the erection of the building. These Commission ers located the institution at Mt. Pleasant, Henry County. A plan for a building designed to accommodate 300 patients, drawn by Dr. Bell, of Massa chusetts, was accepted, and in October work was commenced under the superin tendence of Mr. Henry Winslow. Up to February 25, 1858, and including an appropriation made on that date, the Legislature had appropriated $258,555.67 to this institution, but the building was not finished ready for occupancy by patients until March 1, 1861. The Trustees were Maturin L. Fisher, Presi dent, Farmersburg; Samuel McFarland, Secretary, Mt. Pleasant; D. L."], [194, "196 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. McGugin, Keokuk; G. W. Kincaid, Muscatine; J. D. Elbert, Keosauqua; John B. Lash and Harpin Riggs, Mt. Pleasant. Richard J. Patterson, M. D., of Ohio, was elected Superintendent; Dwight C. Dewey, M. D., Assistant Physician; Henry Winslow, Steward; Mrs. Catharine Winslow, Matron. The Hospital was formally opened March 6, 1861, and one hundred patients were admitted within three months. About 1865, Dr. Mark Ranney became Superintendent. April 18, 1876, a portion of the hospital building was destroyed by fire. From the opening of the Hospital to the close of October, 1877, 3,584 patients had been admitted. Of these, 1,141 were discharged recovered, 505 discharged improved, 589 discharged unimproved, and 1 died ; total discharged, 2,976, leaving 608 inmates. During this period, there were 1,384 females admitted, whose occupation was registered \"domestic duties;\" 122, no occupation; 25, female teachers; 11, seamstresses: and 25, servants. Among the males were 916 farmers, 394 laborers, 205 without occupation, 39 cabinet makers, 23 brewers, 31 clerks, 26 merchants, 12 preachers, 18 shoe makers, 13 students, 14 tailors, 13 teachers, 14 agents, 17 masons, 7 lawyers, 7 physicians, 4 saloon keepers, 3 salesmen, 2 artists, and 1 editor. The pro ducts of the farm and garden, in 1876, amounted to $13,721.26. Trustees, 1877 :\u2014 T. Whiting, President, Mt. Pleasant ; Mrs. E. M. Elliott, Secretary, Mt. Pleasant; William C. Evans, West Liberty; L. E. Fellows, Lansing ; and Samuel Klein, Keokuk ; Treasurer, M. Edwards, Mt. Pleasant. Resident Officers : \u2014 Mark Ranney, M. D., Medical Superintendent; H. M. Bassett, M. D.. First Assistant Physician; M. Riordan, M. D., Second Assistant Physician ; Jennie McCowen, M. D., Third Assistant Physician ; J. W. Hender son, Steward : Mrs. Martha W. Ranney, Matron ; Rev. Milton Sutton, Chaplain. HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE. Independence, Buchanan County. In the Winter of 1867-8, a bill providing for an additional Hospital for the Insane was passed by the Legislature, and an appropriation of $125,000 was made for that purpose. Maturin L. Fisher, of Clayton County ; E. G. Morgan, of Webster County, and Albert Clark, of Buchanan County, were appointed Commissioners to locate and supervise the erection of the Building. Mr. Clark died about a year after his appointment, and Hon. G. W. Bemis, of Indepen dence, was appointed to fill the vacancy. The Commissioners met and commenced their labors on the 8th day of June, 1868, at Independence. The act under which they were appointed required them to select the most eligible and desirable location, of not less than 320 acres, within two miles of the city of Independence, that might be offered by the citizens free of charge to the State. Several such tracts were offered, but the Commissioners finally selected the south half of southwest quarter of Section 5 ; the north half of northeast quarter of Section 7 ; the north half of northwest quarter of Section 8, and the north half of northeast quarter of Sec tion 8, all in Township 88 north, Range 9 west of the Fifth Principal Meridian. This location is on the west side of the Wapsipinicon River, and about a mile from its banks, and about the same distance from Independence. Col. S. V. Shipman, of Madison, Wis., was employed to prepare plans, specifications and drawings of the building, which, when completed, were sub mitted to Dr. M. Ranney, Superintendent of the Hospital at Mount Pleasant, who suggested several improvements. The contract for erecting the building"], [195, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 197 was awarded to Mr. David Armstrong, of Dubuque, for $88,114. The con tract was signed November 7, 1868, and Mr. Armstrong at once commenced work. Mr. George Josselyn was appointed to superintend the work. The main buildings were constructed of dressed limestone, from the quarries at Anamosa and Farley. The basements are of the local granite worked from the immense boulders found in large quantities in this portion of the State. In 1872, the building was so far completed that the Commissioners called the first meeting of the Trustees, on the 10th day of July of that year. These Trustees were Maturin L. Fisher, Mrs. P. A. Appleman, T. W. Fawcett, C. C. Parker, E. G. Morgan, George AV. Bemis and John M. Boggs. This board was organized, on the day above mentioned, by the election of Hon. M. L. Fisher, President ; Rev. J. G. Boggs, Secretary, and George W. Bemis, Treas urer, and, after adopting preliminary measures for organizing the local govern ment of the hospital, adjourned to the first AVednesday of the following Septem ber. A few days before this meeting, Mr. Boggs died of malignant fever, and Dr. John G. House was appointed to fill the vacancy. Dr. House was elected Secretary. At this meeting, Albert Reynolds, M. D., was elected Superintendent ; George Josselyn, Steward, and Mrs. Anna B. Josselyn, Matron. September 4, 1873, Dr. Willis Butterfield was elected Assistant Physician. The building was ready for occupancy April 21, 1873. In the Spring of 1876, a contract was made with Messrs. Mackay & Lundy, of Independence, for furnishing materials for building the outside walls of the two first sections of the south wing, next to the center building, for $6,250. The carpenter work on the fourth and fifth stories of the center building was completed during the same year, and the wards were furnished and occupied by patients in the Fall. In 1877, the south wing was built, but it will not be completed ready for occupancy until next Spring or Summer (1878). October 1, 1877, the Superintendent reported 322 patients in this hospital, and it is now overcrowded. The Board of Trustees at present (1878) are as follows : Maturin L. Fisher, President, Farmersburg ; John G. House, M. D., Secretary, Indepen dence; Wm. G. Donnan, Treasurer, Independence; Erastus G. Morgan, Fort Dodge ; Mrs. Prudence A. Appleman, Clermont ; and Stephen E. Robinson, M. D., West Union. RESIDENT OFFICERS. Albert Reynolds, M. D., Superintendent; G. H. Hill, M. D., Assistant Physician; Noyes Appleman, Steward; Mrs. Lucy M. Gray, Matron. IOWA COLLEGE FOR THE BLIND. Vinton, Benton County. In August, 1852, Prof. Samuel Bacon, himself blind, established an Insti tution for the Instruction of the Blind of Iowa, at Keokuk. By act of the General Assembly, entitled \" An act to establish an Asylum for the Blind,\" approved January 18, 1853, the institution was adopted by the State, removed to Iowa City, February 3d, and opened for the reception of pupils April 4, 1853, free to all the blind in the State. The first Board of Trustees were James D. Eads, President ; George W. McClary, Secretary; James H. Gower, Treasurer; Martin L. Morris, Stephen Hempstead, Morgan Reno and John McCaddon. The Board appointed Prof."], [196, "198 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Samuel Bacon, Principal ; T. J. McGittigen, Teacher of Music, and Mrs. Sarah K. Bacon, Matron. Twenty-three pupils were admitted during the first term. In his first report, made in 1854, Prof. Bacon suggested that the name should be changed from \"Asylum for the Blind,\" to that of \"Institution for the Instruction of the Blind.\" This was done in 1855, when the General As sembly made an annual appropriation for the College of $55 per quarter for each pupil. This was subsequently changed to $3,000 per annum, and a charge of $25 as an admission fee for each pupil, which sum, with the amounts realized from the sale of articles manufactured by the blind pupils, proved sufficient for the expenses of the institution during Mr. Bacon's administration. Although Mr. Bacon was blind, he was a fine scholar and an economical manager, and had founded the Blind Asylum at Jacksonville, Illinois. As a mathematician he had few superiors. On the 8th of May, 1858, the Trustees met at Vinton, and made arrange ments for securing the donation of $5,000 made by the citizens of that town. In June of that year, a quarter section of land was donated for the College, by John W. O. Webb and others, and the Trustees adopted a plan for the erection of a suitable building. In 1860, the plan was modified, and the con tract for enclosing let to Messrs. Finkbine & Lovelace, for $10,420. In August, 1862, the building was so far completed that the goods and fur uiture of the institution were removed from Iowa City to Vinton, and early in October, the school was opened there with twenty-four pupils. At this time, Rev. Orlando Clark was Principal. In August, 1864, a new Board of Trustees were appointed by the Legisla ture, consisting of James McQuin, President; Reed Wilkinson, Secretary; Jas.

Wilkinson and Miss Amelia Butler were appointed Assistant Teachers ; Mrs. N. A. Morton, Matron. Mr. Wilkinson resigned in June, 1867, and Gen. James L. Geddes was appointed in his place. In September, 1869, Mr. Geddes retired, and was succeeded by Prof. S. A. Knapp. Mrs. S. C. Lawton was appointed Matron, and was succeeded by Mrs. M. A. Knapp. Prof. Knapp resigned July 1, 1875, and Prof. Orlando Clark was elected Principal, who died April 2, 1876, and was succeeded by John B.

The Legislative Committee who visited this institution in 1878 expressed their astonishment at the vast expenditure of money in proportion to the needs of the State. The structure is well built, and the money properly expended ; yet it was enormously beyond the necessities of the State, and shows an utter disregard of the fitness of things. The Committee could not understand why $282,000 should have been expended for a massive building covering about two and a half acres for the accommodation of 130 people, costing over eight thou sand dollars a year to heat it, and costing the State about five hundred dollars a year for each pupil."], [197, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 199 INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB. Council Bluffs, Pottawattomie County. The Iowa Institution for the Deaf and Dumb was established at Iowa City by an act of the General Assembly, approved January 24, 1855. The number of deaf mutes then in the State was 301 ; the number attending the Institution, 50. The first Board of Trustees were: Hon. Samuel J. Kirkwood, Hon. E. Sells, W. Penn Clarke, J. P. Wood, H. D. Downey, William Crum, W. E. Ijams, Principal. On the resignation of Mr. Ijams, in 1862, the Board appointed in his stead Mr. Benjamin Talbot, for nine years a teacher in the Ohio Institution for the Deaf and Dumb. Mr. Talbot was ardently devoted to the interests of the institution and a faithful worker for the unfortunate class under his charge. A strong effort was made, in 1866, to remove this important institution to Des Moines, but it was located permanently at Council Bluffs, and a building rented for its use. In 1868, Commissioners were appointed to locate a site for, and to superintend the erection of, a new building, for which the Legislature appropriated $125,000 to commence the work of construction. The Commis sioners selected ninety acres of land about two miles south of the city of Coun cil Bluffs. The main building and one wing were completed October 1, 1870, and immediately occupied by the Institution. February 25, 1877, the main building and east wing were destroyed by fire; and August 6 following, the roof of the new west wing was blown off and the walls partially demolished by a tornado. At the time of the fire, about one hundred and fifty pupils were in attendance. After the fire, half the classes were dismissed and the number of scholars reduced to about seventy, and in a week or two the school was in run ning order. The Legislative Committee which visited this Institution in the W inter of 1857-8 was not well pleased with the condition of affairs, and reported that the building (west wing) was a disgrace to the State and a monument of unskillful workmanship, and intimated rather strongly that some reforms in management were very essential.

SOLDIERS' ORPHANS' HOMES. Davenport, Cedar Falls, Glemvood. The movement which culminated in the establishment of this beneficent in stitution was originated by Mrs. Annie Wittenmeyer, during the civil war of 1861-65. This noble and patriotic lady called a convention at Muscatine, on the 7th of October 1863, for the purpose of devising measures for the support and education of the orphan children of the brave sons of Iowa, who had fallen in defense of national honor and integrity. So great was the public interest in the movement that there was a large representation from all parts of the State on the day named, and an association was organized called the Iowa State Or phan Asylum."], [198, "200 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. s The first officers were : President, William M. Stone ; Vice Presidents, Mrs. G. G. Wright, Mrs. R. L. Cadle, Mrs. J. T. Hancock, John R. Needham, J. AY. Cattell, Mrs. Mary M. Bagg ; Recording Secretary, Miss Mary Kibben ; Cor responding Secretary, Miss M. E. Shelton; Treasurer, N. H. Brainerd; Board of Trustees, Mrs. Annie AVittenmeyer, Mrs. C. B. Darwin, Mrs. D. T. Newcomb. Mrs. L. B. Stephens, 0. Fayville, E. H. AYilliams, T. S. Parvin, Mrs. Shields, Caleb Baldwin, C. C. Cole, Isaac Pendleton, H. C. Henderson. The first meeting of the Trustees was held February 14, 1864, in the Repre sentative Hall, at Des Moines. Committees from both branches of the General Assembly were present and were invited to participate in their deliberations. Gov. Kirkwood suggested that a home for disabled soldiers should be connected with the Asylum. Arrangements were made for raising funds. At the next meeting, in Davenport, in March, 1864, the Trustees decided to commence operations at once, and a committee, of which Mr. Howell, of Keo kuk, was Chairman, was appointed to lease a suitable building, solicit donations, and procure suitable furniture. This committee secured a large brick building in Lawrence, Aran Buren County, and engaged Mr. Fuller, of Mt. Pleasant, as Steward. At the annual meeting, in Des Moines, in June, 1864, Mrs. C. B. Baldwin, Mrs. G. G. AVright, Mrs. Dr. Horton, Miss Mary E. Shelton and Mr. George Sherman were appointed a committee to furnish the building and take all neces sary steps for opening the \"Home,\" and notice was given that at the next meeting of the Association, a motion would be made to change the name of the Institution to Iowa Orphans' Home. The work of preparation was conducted so vigorously that on the 13th day of July following, the Executive Committee announced that they were ready to receive the children. In three weeks twenty-one were admitted, and the num ber constantly increased, so that, in a little more than six months from the time of opening, there were seventy children admitted, and twenty more applica tions, which the Committee had not acted upon \u2014 all orphans of soldiers. Miss M. Elliott, of Washington, was appointed Matron. She resigned, in February, 1865, and was succeeded by Mrs. E. G. Platt, of Fremont County. The \" Home \" was sustained by the voluntary contributions of the people, until 1866, when it was assumed by the State. In that year, the General Assembly provided for the location of several such \"Homes\" in the different counties, and which were established at Davenport, Scott County; Cedar Falls, Black Hawk County, and at Glenwood, Mills County. The Board of Trustees elected by the General Assembly had the oversight and management of the Soldiers' Orphans' Homes of the State, and consisted of one person from each county in which such Home was located, and one for the State at large, who held their office two years, or until their successors were elected and qualified. An appropriation of $10 per month for each orphan actually supported was made by the General Assembly. The Home in Cedar Falls was organized in 1865, and an old hotel building was fitted up for it. Rufus O, Mary L. and Emma L. Bauer were the first children received, in October, and by January, 1866, there were ninety-six in mates. October 12, 1869, the Home was removed to a large brick building, about two miles west of Cedar Falls, and was very prosperous for several years, but in 1876, the General Assembly established a State Normal School at Cedar Falls and appropriated the buildings and grounds for that purpose."], [199, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 201 By \"An act to provide for the organization and support of an asylum at Glenwood, in Mills County, for feeble minded children,\" approved March 17, 1876, the buildings and grounds used by the Soldiers' Orphans' Home at that place were appropriated for this purpose. By another act, approved March 15, 1876, the soldiers' orphans, then at the Homes at Glenwood and Cedar Falls, were to be removed to the Home at Davenport within ninety days thereafter, and the Board of Trustees of the Home were authorized to receive other indigent children into that institution, and provide for their education in industrial pursuits. STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. Cedar Falls, Black Hawk County. Chapter 129 of the laws of the Sixteenth General Assembly, in 1876, estab lished a State Normal School at Cedar Falls, Black Hawk County, and required the Trustees of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home to turn over the property in their charge to the Directors of the new institution. The Board of Directors met at Cedar Falls June 7, 1876, and duly organ ized by the election of H. C. Hemenway, President ; J. J. Toleston, Secretary, and E. Townsend, Treasurer. The Board of Trustees of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home met at the same time for the purpose of turning over to the Directors the property of that institution, which was satisfactorily done and properly receipted for as required by law. At this meeting, Prof. J. C. Gilchrist was elected Principal of the School. On the 12th of July, 1876, the Board again met, when executive and teachers' committees were appointed and their duties assigned. A Steward and a Matron were elected, and their respective duties defined. The buildings and grounds were repaired and fitted up as well as the appro priation would admit, and the first term of the school opened September 6, 1876, commencing with twenty-seven and closing with eighty-seven students. The second term closed with eighty-six, and one hundred and six attended during the third term. The following are the Board of Directors, Board of Officers and Faculty : Board of Directors. \u2014 H.

Chapter 152 of the laws of the Sixteenth General Assembly, approved March 17, 1876, provided for the establishment of an asylum for feeble minded children at Glenwood, Mills County, and the buildings and grounds of the"], [200, "202 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Soldiers' Orphans' Home at that place were to be used for that purpose. The asylum was placed under the management of three Trustees, one at least of whom should be a resident of Mills County. Children between the ages of 7 and 18 years are admitted. Ten dollars per month for each child actually sup ported by the State was appropriated by the act, and $2,000 for salaries of officers and teachers for two years. Hon. J. W. Cattell, of Polk County ; A. J. Russell, of Mills County, and W. S. Robertson, were appointed Trustees, who held their first meeting at Glenwood, April 26, 1876. Mr. Robertson was elected President; Mr. Russell, Treasurer, and Mr. Cattell, Secretary. The Trustees found the house and farm which had been turned over to them in a shamefully dilapidated condition. The fences were broken down and the lumber destroyed or carried away ; the win dows broken, doors off their hinges, floors broken and filthy in the extreme, cellars reeking with offensive odors from decayed vegetables, and every conceiv able variety of filth and garbage ; drains obstructed, cisterns broken, pump demoralized, wind-mill broken, roof leaky, and the whole property in the worst possible condition. It was the first work of the Trustees to make the house tenable. This was done under the direction of Mr. Russell. At the request of the Trustees, Dr. Charles T. AVilbur, Superintendent of the Illinois Asylum, visited Glenwood, and made many valuable suggestions, and gave them much assistance. 0. AV. Archibald, M. D., of Glenwood, was appointed Superintendent, and soon after was appointed Secretary of the Board, vice Cattell, resigned. Mrs. S. A. Archibald was appointed Matron, and Miss Maud M. Archibald, Teacher. The Institution was opened September 1, 1876 ; the first pupil admitted September 4, and the school was organized September 10, with only five pupils, which number had, in November, 1877, increased'to eighty-seven. December 1, 1876, Miss Jennie Van Dorin, of Fairfield, was employed as a teacher and in the Spring of 1877, Miss Sabina J. Archibald was also employed. THE REFORM SCHOOL. Eldora, Hardin County. By \"An act to establish and organize a State Reform School for Juvenile Offenders,\" approved March 31, 1868, the General Assembly established a State Reform School at Salem, Lee (Henry) County; provided for a Board of Trustees, to consist of one person from each Congressional District. For the purpose of immediately opening the school, the Trustees were directed to accept the proposition of the Trustees of AVhite's Iowa Manual Labor Institute, at Salem, and lease, for not more than ten years, the lands, buildings, etc., of the Institute, and at once proceed to prepare for and open a reform school as a temporary establishment. The contract for fitting up the buildings was let to Clark & Haddock, Sep tember 21, 1868, and on the 7th of October following, the first inmate was received from Jasper County. The law provided for the admission of children of both sexes under 18 years osage. In 1876, this was amended, so that they are now received at ages over 7 and under 16 years. April 19, 1872, the Trustees were directed to make a permanent location for the school, and $45,000 was appropriated for the erection of the necessary buildings. The Trustees were further directed, as soon as practicable, to organize a school for girls in the buildings where the boys were then kept."], [201, "203 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. The Trustees located the school at Eldora, Hardin County, and in the Code of 1873, it is permanently located there by law. The institution is managed by five Trustees, who are paid mileage, but no compensation for their services. The object is the reformation of the children of both sexes, under the age of 16 years and over 7 years of age, and the law requires that the Trustees shall require the boys and girls under their charge to be instructed in piety and morality, and in such branches of useful knowledge as are adapted to their age and capacity, and in some regular course of labor, either mechanical, manufac turing or agricultural, as is best suited to their age, strength, disposition and capacity, and as may seem best adapted to secure the reformation and future benefit of the boys and girls. A boy or girl committed to the State Reform School is there kept, disci plined, instructed, employed and governed, under the direction of the Trustees, until he or she arrives at the age of majority, or is bound out, reformed or legally discharged. The binding out or discharge of a boy or girl as reformed, or having arrived at the age of majority, is a complete release from all penalties incurred by conviction of the offense for which he or she was committed. This is one step in the right direction. In the future, however, still further advances will be made, and the right of every individual to the fruits of their labor, even while restrained for the public good, will be recognized. FISH HATCHING ESTABLISHMENT. Near Anamosa, Jones County. The Fifteenth General Assembly, in 1874, passed \" An act to provide for the appointment of a Board of Fish Commissioners for the construction of Fishways for the protection and propagation of Fish,\" also \"An act to provide for furnishing the rivers and lakes with fish and fish spawn.\" This act appro priated $3,000 for the purpose. In accordance with the provisions of the first act above mentioned, on the 9th of April, 1874, S. B. Evans of Ottumwa, Wapello County ; B. F. Shaw of Jones County, and Charles A. Haines, of Black Hawk County, were appointed to be Fish Commissioners by the Governor. These Commissioners met at Des Moines, May 10, 1874, and organized by the election of Mr. Evans, President ; Mr. Shaw, Secretary and Superintendent, and Mr. Haines, Treasurer. The State was partitioned into three districts or divisions to enable the Commissioners to better superintend the construction of fishways as required by law. That part of the State lying south of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad was placed under the especial supervision of Mr. Evans ; that part be tween that railroad and the Iowa Division of the Illinois Central Railroad, Mr. Shaw, and all north of the Illinois Central Railroad, Mr. Haines. At this meeting, the Superintendent was authorized to build a State Hatching House ; to procure the spawn of valuable fish adapted to the waters of Iowa ; hatch and prepare the young fish for distribution, and assist in putting them into the waters of the State. In compliance with these instructions, Mr. Shaw at once commenced work, and in the Summer of 1874, erected a \" State Hatching House\" near Anamosa, 20x40 feet, two stories ; the second story being designed for a tenement ; the first story being the \"hatching room.\" The hatching troughs are supplied with water from a magnificent spring four feet deep and about ten feet in diam eter, affording an abundant and unfailing supply of pure running water. During"], [202, "204 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. the first year, from May 10, 1874, to May 10, 1875, the Commissioners distributed within the State 100,000 Shad, 300,000 California Salmon, 10,000 Bass, 80,000 Penobscot (Maine) Salmon, 5,000 land-locked Salmon, 20,000 of other species. By act approved March 1 0, 1876, the law was amended so that there should be but one instead of three Fish Commissioners, and B. F. Shaw was appointed, and the Commissioner was authorized to purchase twenty acres of land, on which the State Hatching House was located near Anamosa. In the Fall of 1876, Commissioner Shaw gathered from the sloughs of the Mississippi, where they would have been destroyed, over a million and a half of small fish, which were distributed in the various rivers of the State and turned into the Mississippi. In 1875-6, 533,000 California Salmon, and in 1877, 303,500 Lake Trout were distributed in various rivers and lakes in the State. The experiment of stocking the small streams with brook trout is being tried, and 81,000 of the speckled beauties were distributed in 1877. In 1876, 100,000 young eels were distrib ited. These came from New York and they are increasing rapidly. At the close of 1877, there were at least a dozen private fish farms in suc cessful operation in various parts of the State. Commissioner Shaw is en thusiastically devoted to the duties of his office and has performed an important service for the people of the State by his intelligent and successful operations. The Sixteenth General Assembly passed an act in 1878, prohibiting the catching of any kind of fish except Brook Trout from March until June of each year. Some varieties are fit for food only during this period. THE TUBLIC LANDS. The grants of public lands made in the State of Iowa, for various purposes, are as follows : 1. The 500,000 Acre Grant. 2. The 16th Section Grant. 3. The Mortgage School Lands. 4. The University Grant. 5. The Saline Grant. 6. The Des Moines River Grant. 7. The Des Moines River School Lands. 8. The Swamp Land Grant. 9. The Railroad Grant. 10. The Agricultural College Grant I. THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE GRANT. When the State was admitted into the Union, she became entitled to 500,000 acres of land by virtue of an act of Congress, approved September 4, 1841, which granted to each State therein specified 500,000 acres of public land for internal improvements ; to each State admitted subsequently to the passage of the act, an amount of land which, with the amount that might have been granted to her as a Territory, would amount to 500,000 acres. All these lands were required to be selected within the limits of the State to which they were granted. The Constitution cf Iowa declares that the proceeds of this grant, together with all lands then granted or to be granted by Congress for the benefit of schools, shall constitute a perpetual fund for the support of schools throughout the State. By an act approved January 15, 1849, the Legislature established"], [203, "205 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. a board of School Fund Commissioners, and to that board was confided the selection, care and sale of these lands for the benefit of the School Fund. Until 1855, these Commissioners were subordinate to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, but on the 15th of January of that year, they were clothed with exclusive authority in the management and sale of school binds. The office of School Fund Commissioner was abolished March 23, 1858, and that officer in each county was required to transfer all papers to and make full settlement with the County Judge. By this act, County Judges and Township Trustees were made the agents of the State to control and sell the sixteenth sections ; but no further provision was made for the sale of the 500,000 acre grant until April 3d, 1860, when the entire management of the school lands was committed to the Boards of Supervisors of the several counties. II. THE SIXTEENTH SECTIONS. By the provisions of the act of Congress admitting Iowa to the Union, there was granted to the new State the sixteenth section in every township, or where that section had been sold, other lands of like amount for the use of schools. The Constitution of the State provides that the proceeds arising from the sale of these sections shall constitute a part of the permanent School Fund. The control and sale of these lands were vested in the School Fund Commissioners of the several counties until March 23, 1858, when they were transferred to the County Judges and Township Trustees, and were finally placed under the supervision of the County Boards of Supervisors in January, 1861. III. THE MORTGAGE SCHOOL LANDS. These do not belong to any of the grants of land proper. They are lands that have been mortgaged to the school fund, and became school lands when bid off by the State by virtue of a law passed in 1802. Under the provisions of the law regulating the management and investment of the permanent school fund, persons desiring loans from that fund are required to secure the payment thereof with interest at ten per cent, per annum, by promissory notes endorsed by two good sureties and by mortgage on unincumbered real estate, which must be situated in the county where the loan is made, and which must be valued by three appraisers. Making these loans and taking the required securities was made the duty of the County Auditor, who was required to report to the Board of Supervisors at each meeting thereof, all notes, mortgages and abstracts of title connected with the school fund, for examination. When default was made of payment of money so secured by mortgage, and no arrangement made for extension of time as the law provides, the Board of Supervisors were authorized to bring suit and prosecute it with diligence to secure said fund ; and in action in favor of the county for the use of the school fund, an injunction may issue without bonds, and in any such action, when service is made by publication, default and judgment may be entered and enforced without bonds. In case of sale of land on execution founded on any such mortgage, the attorney of the board, or other person duly authorized, shall, on behalf of the State or county for the use of said fund, bid such sum as the interests of said fund may require, and if struck off to the State the land shall be held and disposed of as the other lands belonging to the fund. These lands are known as the Mortgage School Lands, and reports of them, including description and amount, are required to be made to the State Land Office."], [204, "206 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. IV. UNIVERSITY LANDS. By act of Congress, July 20, 1840, a quantity of land not exceeding two entire townships was reserved in the Territory of Iowa for the use and support if a university within said Territory when it should become a State. This land was to be located in tracts of not less than an entire section, and could be used for no other purpose than that designated in the grant. In an act supplemental to that for the admission of Iowa, March 3, 1845, the grant was renewed, and it was provided that the lands should be used \" solely for the purpose of such university, in such manner as the Legislature may prescribe.\" Under this grant there were set apart and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, for the use of the State, the following lands : ACRES. In the Iowa City Land District, Feb. 26, 1849 20,150.49 In the Fairfield Land District, Oct. 17, 1849 9,685.20 In the Iowa City Land District, Jan. 28, 1850 2,571.81 In the Fairfield Land District, Sept. 10, 1850 3,198.20 In the Dubuque Land District, May 19, 1852 10,552.24 Total 45,957.94 These lands were certified to the State November 19, 1859. The University lands are placed by law under the control and management of the Board of Trustees of the Iowa State University. Prior to 1865, there had been selected and located under 282 patents, 22,892 acres in sixteen counties, and 23,036 acres unpatented, making a total of 45,928 acres. V. SALINE LANDS. By act of Congress, approved March 3, 1845, the State of Iowa was granted the use of the salt springs within her limits, not exceeding twelve. By a subsequent act, approved May 27, 1852, Congress granted the springs to the State in fee simple, together with six sections of land contiguous to each, to be disposed of as the Legislature might direct. In 1861, the proceeds of these lands then to be sold were constituted a fund for founding and support ing a lunatic asylum, but no sales were made. In 1856, the proceeds of the saline lands were appropriated to the Insane Asylum, repealed in 1858. In 1860, the saline lands and funds were made a part of the permanent fund of the State University. These lands were located in Appanoose, Davis, Decatur, Lucas, Monroe, Van Buren and AVayne Counties. VI. \u2014 THE DES MOINES RIVER GRANT. By act of Congress, approved August 8, 1846, a grant of land was made for the improvement of the navigation of Des Moines River, as follows : Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there be, and hereby is, granted to said Territory of Iowa, for the purpose of aiding said Territory to improve the navigation of the Des Moines River from its mouth to the Raccoon Fork (so called) in said Territory, one equal moiety, in alternate sections, of the public lands (remaining unsold and not otherwise disposed of, incumbered or appropri ated), in a strip five miles in width on each side of said river, to be selected within said Terri tory by an agent or agents to be appointed by the Governor thereof, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That the lands hereby granted shall not be conveyed or disposed of by said Territory, nor by any State to be formed out of the same, except as said improvement shall progress ; that is, the said Territory or State may sell so much of said lands as shall produce the sum of thirty thousand dollars, and then the sales shall cease until the Gov ernor of said Territory or State shall certify the fact to the President of the United States that one-half of said sum has been expended upon said improvements, when the said Territory or"], [205, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 207 State may sell and convey a quantity of the residue of said lands sufficient to replace the amount expended, and thus the sales shall progress as the proceeds thereof shall be expended, and the fact of such expenditure shall be certified as aforesaid. Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That the said River Des Moines shall be and forever remain a public highway for the use of the Government of the United States, free from any toll or other charge whatever, for any property of the United States or persons in their service passing through or along the same : Provided always, That it shall not be competent for the said Territory or future State of Iowa to dispose of said lands, or any of them, at a price lower than, for the time being, shall be the minimum price of other public lands. Sec. 4. And be it further enacted, That wheneverthe Territory of Iowa shall be admitted into the Union as a State, the lands hereby granted for the above purpose shall be and become the property of said State for the purpose contemplated in this act, and for no other : Provided the Legislature of the State of Iowa shall accept the said grant for the said purpose.\" Approved Aug. 8, 1846. By joint resolution of the General Assembly of Iowa, approved January 9, 1847, the grant was accepted for the purpose specified. By another act, ap proved February 24, 1847, entited \"An act creating the Board of Public Works, and providing for the improvement of the Des Moines River,\" the Legislature provided for a Board consisting of a President, Secretary and Treasurer, to be elected by the people. This Board was elected August 2, 1847, and was organized on the 22d of September following. The same act defined the nature of the improvement to be made, and provided that the work should be paid for from the funds to be derived from the sale of lands to be sold by the Board. Agents appointed by the Governor selected the sections designated by \"odd numbers\" throughout the whole extent of the grant, and this selection was ap proved by the Secretary of the Treasury. But there was a conflict of opinion as to the extent of the grant. It was held by some that it extended from the mouth of the Des Moines only to the Raccoon Forks ; others held, as the agents to make selection evidently did, that it extended from the mouth to the head waters of the river. Richard M. Young, Commissioner of the General Land Office, on the 23d of February, 1848, construed the grant to mean that \"the State is entitled to the alternate sections within five miles of the Des Moines River, throughout the whole extent of that river within the limits of Iowa.\" Under this construction, the alternate sections above the Raccoon Forks would, of course, belong to the State; but on the 19th of June, 1848, some of these lands were, by proclamation, thrown into market. On the 18th of September, the Board of Public AVorks filed a remonstrance with the Com missioner of the General Land Office. The Board also sent in a protest to the State Land Office, at which the sale was ordered to take place. On the 8th of January, 1849, the Senators and Representatives in Congress from Iowa also protested against the sale, in a communication to Hon. Robert J. AAralker, Sec retary of the Treasury, to which the Secretary replied, concurring in the opinion that the grant extended the whole length of the Des Moines River in Iowa. On the 1st of June, 1849, the Commissioner of the General Land Office directed the Register and Receiver of the Land Office at Iowa City \"to with hold from sale all lands situated in the odd numbered sections within five miles on each side of the Des Moines River above the Raccoon Forks.\" March 13, 1850, the Commissioner of the General Land Office submitted to the Secretary of the Interior a list \"showing the tracts falling within the limits of the Des Moines River grant, above the Raccoon Forks, etc., under the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury, of March 2, 1849,\" and on the 6th of April following, Mr. Ewing, then Secretary of the Interior, reversed the decision of Secretary AValker, but ordered the lands to be withheld from sale until Con-"], [206, "208 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. gress could have an opportunity to pass an explanatory act. The Iowa author ities appealed from this decision to the President (Taylor), who referred the matter to the Attorney General (Mr. Johnson). On the 19th of July, Mr. Johnson submitted as his opinion, that by the terms of the grant itself, it ex tended to the very source of the Des Moines, but before his opinion was pub lished President Taylor died. AVhen Mr. Tyler's cabinet was formed, the question was submitted to the new Attorney General (Mr. Crittenden), who, on the 30th of June, 1851, reported that in his opinion the grant did not extend above the Raccoon Forks. Mr. Stewart, Secretary of the Interior, concurred with Mr. Crittenden at first, but subsequently consented to lay the whole sub ject before the President and Cabinet, who decided in favor of the State. October 29, 1851, Mr. Stewart directed the Commissioner of the General Land Office to \"submit for his approval such lists as had been prepared, and to proceed to report for like approval lists of the alternate sections claimed by the State of Iowa above the Raccoon Forks, as far as the surveys have progressed, or may hereafter be completed and returned.\" And on the following day, three lists of these lands were prepared in the General Land Office. The lands approved and certified to the State of Iowa under this grant, and all lying above the Raccoon Forks, are as follows : By Secretary Stewart, Oct. 30, 1851 81,707.93 acres. March 10, 18.52 143,908.37 \" By Secretary McLellan, Dec. 17, 1853 33,142.43 \" Dec. 30, 1853 12,813.51 \" Total 271, 572.24 acres. The Commissioners and Register of the Des Moines River Improvement, in their report to the Governor, November 30, 1852, estimates the total amount of lands then available for the work, including those in possession of the State and those to be surveyed and approved, at nearly a million acres. The indebtedness then standing against the fund was about $108,000, and the Commissioners estimated the work to be clone would cost about $1,200,000. January 19, 1853, the Legislature authorized the Commissioners to sell \" any or all the lands which have or may hereafter be granted, for not less than $1,300,000.\" On the 24th of January, 1853, the General Assembly provided for the elec tion of a Commissioner by the people, and appointed two Assistant Commission ers, with authority to make a contract, selling the lands of the Improvement for $1,300,000. This new Board made a contract, June 9, 1855, with the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company, agreeing to sell all the lands donated to the State by Act of Congress of August 8, 1846, \u25a0which the State had not sold prior to December 23, 1853, for $1,300,000, to be expended on the im provement of the river, and in paying the indebtedness then due. This con tract was duly reported to the Governor and General Assembly. By an act approved January 25, 1855, the Commissioner and Register of the Des Moines River Improvement were authorized to negotiate with the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company for the purchase of lands in AYebster County which had been sold by the School Fund Commissioner as school lands, but which had been certified to the State as Des Moines River lands, and had, therefore, become the property of the Company, under the provisions of its contract with the State. March 21, 1856, the old question of the extent of the grant was again raised and the Commissioner of the General Land Office decided tlv it was limited to"], [207, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 209 the Raccoon Fork. Appeal was made to the Secretary of the Interior, and by him the matter was referred to the Attorney General, who decided that the grant extended to the northern boundary of the State; the State relinquished its claim to lands lying along the river in Minnesota, and the vexed question was supposed to be finally settled. The land which had been certified, as well as those extending to the north ern boundary within the limits of the grant, were reserved from pre-emption and sale by the General Land Commissioner, to satisfy the grant of August 8, 1846, and they were treated as having passed to the State, which from time to time sold portions of them prior to their final transfer to the Des Moines Navi igation & Railroad Company, applying the proceeds thereof to the improve ment of the river in compliance with the terms of the grant. Prior to the final sale to the Company, June 9, 1854, the State had sold about 327,000 acres, of which amount 58,830 acres were located above the Raccoon Fork. The last certificate of the General Land Office bears date December 30, 1853. After June 9th, 1854, the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company carried on the work under its contract with the State. As the improvement progressed, the State, from time to time, by its authorized officers, issued to the Company, in payment for said work, certificates for lands. But the General Land Office ceased to certify lands under the grant of 1846. The State had made no other provision for paying for the improvements, and disagree ments and misunderstanding arose between the State authorities and the Company. March 22, 1858, a joint resolution was passed by the Legislature submitting a proposition for final settlement to the Company, which was accepted. The Com pany paid to the State $20,000 in cash, and released and conveyed the dredge boat and materials named in the resolution ; and the State, on the 3d of May, 1858, executed to the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company fourteen deeds or patents to the lands, amounting to 256,703.64 acres. Thf se deeds were intended to convey all the lands of this grant certified to the State by the Gen eral Government not previously sold ; but, as if for the purpose of covering any tract or parcel that might have been omitted, the State made another deed of conveyance on the 18th day of May, 1858. These fifteen deeds, it is claimed, by the Company, convey 266,108 acres, of which about 53,367 are below the Raccoon Fork, and the balance, 212,741 acres, are above that point. Besides the lands deeded to the Company, the State had deeded to individual purchasers 58,830 acres above the Raccoon Fork, making an aggregate of 271, 571 acres, deeded above the Fork, all of which had been certified to the State by the Federal Government. By act approved March 28, 1858, the Legislature donated the remainder of the grant to the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad Company, upon condition that said Company assumed all liabilities resulting from the Des Moines River improvement operations, reserving 50,000 acres of the land in security for the payment thereof, and for the completion of the locks and dams at Bentonsport, Croton, Keosauqua and Plymouth. For every three thousand dollars' worth of work done on the locks and dams, and for every three thousand dollars paid by the Company of the liabilities above mentioned, the Register of the State Land Office was instructed to certify to the Company 1,000 acres of the 50,000 acres reserved for these purposes. Up to 1865, there had been pre sented by the Company, under the provisions of the act of 1858, and allowed, claims amounting to $109,579.37, about seventy-five per cent, of which had been settled."], [208, "210 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. After the passage of the Act above noticed, the question of the extent of the original grant was again mooted, and at the December Term of the Supreme Court of the United States, in 1859-60, a decision was rendered declaring that the grant did not extend above Raccoon Fork, and that all certificates of land above the Fork had been issued without authority of law and were, therefore, void (see 23 How., 66). The State of Iowa had disposed of a large amount of land without authority, according to this decision, and appeal was made to Congress for relief, which was granted on the 3d day of March, 1861, in a joint resolution relinquishing to the State all the title which the United States then still retained in the tracts of land along the Des Moines River above Raccoon Fork, that had been im properly certified to the State by the Department of the Interior, and which is now held by bona fide purchasers under the State of Iowa. In confirmation of this relinquishment, by act approved July 12, 1862, Congress enacted : That the grant of lands to the then Territory of Iowa for the improvement of the Des Moines River, made by the act of August 8, 1846, is hereby extended so as to include the alternate sec tions (designated by odd numbers) lying within five miles of said river, between the Raccoon Fork and the northern boundary of said State ; such lands are to be held and applied in accord ance with the provisions of the original grant, except that the consent of Congress is hereby given to the application of a portion thereof to aid in the construction of the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad, in accordance with the provisions of the act of the General Assembly of the State of Iowa, approved March 22, 1858. And if any of the said lands shall have been sold or otherwise disposed of by the United States before the passage of this act, except those released by the United States to the grantees of the State of Iowa, under joint resolution of March 3, 1861, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby directed to set apart an equal amount of lands within said State to be certified in lieu thereof; Provided, that if the State shall have sold and conveyed any portion of the lands lying within the limits of the grant the title of which has proved invalid, any lands which shall be certified to said State in lieu thereof by virtue of the provisions of this act, shall inure to and be held as a trust fund for the benefit of the person or persons, respect ively, whose titles shall have failed as aforesaid. The grant of lands by the above act of Congress was accepted by a joint resolution of the General Assembly, September 11, 1862, in extra session. On the same day, the Governor was authorized to appoint one or more Commis sioners to select the lands in accordance with the grant. These Commissioners were instructed to report their selections to the Registrar of the State Land Office. The lands so selected were to be held for the purposes of the grant, and were not to be disposed of until further legislation should be had. D. AV. Kil burne, of Lee County, was appointed Commissioner, and, on the 25th day of April, 1864, the General Land Officer authorized the selection of 300,000 acres from the vacant public lands as a part of the grant of July 12, 1862, and the selections were made in the Fort Dodge and Sioux City Land Districts. Many difficulties, controversies and conflicts, in relation to claims and titles, grew out of this grant, and these difficulties were enhanced by the uncertainty of its limits until the act of Congress of July, 1862. But the General Assem bly sought, by wise and appropriate legislation, to protect the integrity of titles derived from the State. Especially was the determination to protect the actual settlers, who had paid their money and made improvements prior to the final settlement of the limits of the grant by Congress. VII. THE DES MOINES RIVER SCHOOL LANDS. These lands constituted a part of the 500,000 acre grant made by Congress in 1841 ; including 28,378.46 acres in AVebster County, selected by the Agent of the State under that grant, and approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office February 20, 1851. They were ordered into the market June 6,"], [209, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 211 1853, by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, who authorized John ToL man, School Fund Commissioner for AVebster County, to sell them as school lands. Subsequently, when the act of 1846 was construed to extend the Des Moines River grant above Raccoon Fork, it was held that the odd numbered sections of these lands within five miles of the river were appropriated by that act, and on the 30th day of December, 1853, 12,813.51 acres were set apart and approved to the State by the Secretary of the Interior, as a part of the Des Moines River grant. January 6, 1854, the Commissioner of the General Land Office transmitted to the Superintendent of Public Instruction a certified copy of the lists of these lands, indorsed by the Secretary of the Interior. Prior to this action of the Department, however, Mr. Tolman had sold to indi vidual purchasers 3,194.28 acres as school lands, and their titles were, of course, killed. For their relief, an act, approved April 2, 1860, provided that, upon application and proper showing, these purchasers should be entitled to draw from the State Treasury the amount they had paid, with 10 per cent, interest, on the contract to purchase made with Mr. Tolman. Under this act, five appli cations were made prior to 1864, and the applicants received, in the aggregate, $949.53. By an act approved April 7, 1862, the Governor was forbidden to issue to the Dubuque & Sioux City Railroad Company any certificate of the completion of any part of said road, or any conveyance of lands, until the company should execute and file, in the State Land Office, a release of its claim \u2014 first, to cer tain swamp lands ; second, to the Des Moines River Lands sold by Tolman ; third, to certain other river lands. That act provided that \" the said company shall transfer their interest in those tracts of land in AVebster and Hamilton Counties heretofore sold by John Tolman, School Fund Commissioner, to the Register of the State Land Office in trust, to enable said Register to carry out and perform said contracts in all cases when he is called upon by the parties interested to do so, before the 1st day of January, A. D. 1864. The company filed its release to the Tolman lands, in the Land Office, Feb ruary 27, 1864, at the same time entered its protest that it had no claim upon them, never had pretended to have, and had never sought to claim them. The Register of the State Land Office, under the advice of the Attorney General, decided that patents would be issued to the Tolman purchasers in all cases where contracts had been made prior to December 23, 1853, and remaining uncanceled under the act of 1860. But before any were issued, on the 27th of August, 1864, the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company commenced a suit in chancery, in the District Court of Polk County, to enjoin the issue of such patents. On the 30th of August, an ex part e injunction was issued. In January, 1868, Mr. J. A. Harvey, Register of the Land Office, filed in the court an elaborate answer to plaintiffs' petition, denying that the company had any right to or title in the lands. Mr. Harvey's successor, Mr. C. C. Carpen ter, filed a still more exhaustive answer February 10, 1868. August 3, 1868, the District Court dissolved the injunction. The company appealed to the Supreme Court, where the decision of the lower court was affirmed in December, 1869. VIII. \u2014 SWAMP LAND GRANT. By an act of Congress, approved March 28, 1850, to enable Arkansas and other States to reclaim swampy lands within their limits, granted all the swamp and overflowed lands remaining unsold within their respective limits to the several States. Although the total amount claimed by Iowa under this act"], [210, "212 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. does not exceed 4,000,000 acres, it has, like the Des Moines River and some of the land grants, cost the State considerable trouble and expense, and required a deal of legislation. The State expended large sums of money in making the selections, securing proofs, etc., but the General Government appeared to be laboring under the impression that Iowa was not acting in good faith ; that she had selected a large amount of lands under the swamp land grant, transferred her interest to counties, and counties to private speculators, and the General Land Office permitted contests as to the character of the lands already selected by the Agents of the State as \"swamp lands.\" Congress, by joint resolution Dec. 18, 1856, and by act March 3, 1857, saved the State from the fatal result of this ruinous policy. Many of these lands were selected in 1854 and 1855, immediately after several remarkably wet seasons, and it was but natural that some portions of the selections would not appear swampy after a few dry seasons. Some time after these first selections were made, persons desired to enter parcels of the so-called swamp lands and offering to prove them to be dry. In such cases the General Land Office ordered hearing before the local land officers, and if they decided the land to be dry, it was permitted to be entered and the claim of the State rejected. Speculators took advantage of this. Affidavits were bought of irresponsible and reckless men, who, for a few dollars, would confidently testify to the character of lands they never saw. These applica tions multiplied until they covered 3,000,000 acres. It was necessary that Congress should confirm all these selections to the State, that this gigantic scheme of fraud and plunder might be stopped. The act of Congress of March 3, 1857, was designed to accomplish this purpose. But the Commis sioner of the General Land Office held that it was only a qualified confirma tion, and under this construction sought to sustain the action of the Department in rejecting the claim of the State, and certifying them under act of May 15, 1856, under which the railroad companies claimed all swamp land in odd num bered sections within the limits of their respective roads. This action led to serious complications. AVhen the railroad grant was made, it was not intended nor was it understood that it included any of the swamp lands. These were already disposed of by previous grant. Nor did the companies expect to receive any of them, but under the decisions of the Department adverse to the State the way was opened, and they were not slow to enter their claims. March 4, 1862, the Attorney General of the State submitted to the General Assembly an opinion that the railroad companies were not entitled even to contest the right of the State to these lands, under the swamp land grant. \u2022 A letter from the Acting Commissioner of the General Land Office expressed the same opinion, and the General Assembly by joint resolution, approved April 7, 1862, expressly repudiated the acts of the railroad companies, and disclaimed any intention to claim these lands under any other than the act of Congress of Sept. 28, 1850. A great deal of legislation has been found necessary in rela tion to these -swamp lands. IX. \u2014 THE RAILROAD GRANT. One of the most important grants of public lands to Iowa for purposes of internal improvement was that known as the \"Railroad Grant,\" by act of Congress approved May 15, 1856. This act granted to the State of Iowa, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of railroads from Burlington, on the Mississippi River, to a point on the Missouri River, near the mouth of Platte River ; from the city of Davenport, via Iowa City and Fort Des Moines to"], [211, "213 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Council Bluffs ; from Lyons City northwesterly to a point of intersection with the main line of the Iowa Central Air Line Railroad, near Maquoketa ; thence on said main line, running as near as practicable to the Forty-second Parallel ; across the said State of Iowa to the Missouri River ; from the city of Dubuque to a point on the Missouri River, near Sioux City, with a branch from the mouth of the Tete des Morts, to the nearest point on said road, to be* com pleted as soon as the main road is completed to that point, every alternate section of land, designated by odd numbers, for six sections in width on each side of said roads. It was also provided that if it should appear, when the lines of those roads were definitely fixed, that the United States had sold, or right of pre emption had attached to any portion of said land, the State was authorized to select a quantity equal thereto, in alternate sections, or parts of sections, within fifteen miles of the lines so located. The lands remaining to the United States within six miles on each side of said roads were not to be sold for less than the double minimum price of the public lands when sold, nor were any of said lands to become subject to private entry until they had been first offered at public sale at the increased price. Section 4 of the act provided that the lands granted to said State shall be disposed of by said State only in the manner following, that is to say : that a quantity of land net exceeding one hundred and twenty sections for each of said roads, and included within a continuous length of twenty miles of each of said roads, may be sold ; and when the Governor of said State shall certify to the Secretary of the Interior that any twenty continuous miles of any of said roads is completed, then another quantity of land hereby granted, not to exceed one hundred and twenty sections for each of said roads having twenty continuous miles completed as aforesaid, and included within a continuous length of twenty miles of each of such roads, may be sold ; and so from time to time until said roads are completed, and if any of said roads are not completed within ten years, no further sale shall be made, and the lands unsold shall revert to the United States.\" At a special session of the General Assembly of Iowa, by act approved July 14, 1856, the grant was accepted and the lands were granted by the State to the several railroad companies named, provided that the lines of their respective roads should be definitely fixed and located before April 1, 1857; and pro vided further, that if either of said companies should fail to have seventy-five miles of road completed and equipped by the 1st day of December, 1859, and its entire roaiffcompleted by December 1, 1865, it should be competent for the State of Iowa to resume all rights to lands remaining undisposed of by the company so failing. The railroad companies, with the single exception of the Iowa Central Air Line, accepted the several grants in accordance with the provisions of the above act, located their respective roads and selected their lands. The grant to the Iowa Central was again granted to the Cedar Rapids & Missouri River Railroad Company, which accepted them. By act, approved April 7, 1862, the Dubuque & Sioux City Railroad Com pany was required to execute a release to the State of certain swamp and school lands, included within the limits of its grant, in compensation for an extension of the time fixed for the completion of its road. A careful examination of the act of Congress does not reveal any special reference to railroad companies. The lands were granted to the State, and the act evidently contemplate the sale of them by the State, and the appropriation of the proceeds to aid in the construction of certain lines of railroad within its"], [212, "214 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. limits. Section 4 of the act clearly defines the authority of the State in dis posing of the lands. Lists of all the lands embraced by the grant were made, and certified to the State by the proper authorities. Under an act of Congress approved August 3, 1854, entitled \"An act to vest in the several States and Territories the title, in fee of the lands which have been or may be certified to them,\" these certified lists, the originals of which are filed in the General Land Office, conveyed to the State \"the fee simple title to all the lands embraced in such lists that are of the char acter contemplated \" by the terms of the act making the grants and \"intended to be granted thereby ; but where lands embraced in such lists are not of the character embraced by such act of Congress, and were not intended to be granted thereby, said lists, so far as these lands are concerned, shall be perfectly null and void; and no right, title, claim or interest shall be conveyed thereby.\" Those certified lists made under the act of May 15, 1856, were forty-three in number, viz.: For the Burlington & Missouri River Railroad, nine; for the Mississippi & Missouri Railroad, 11 ; for the Iowa Central Air Line, thirteen ; and for the Dubuque & Sioux City Railroad, ten. The lands thus approved to the State were as follows : Burlington & Missouri River R. R 287,095.34 acres. Mississippi & Missouri River R. R 774,674.36 \" Cedar Rapids & Missouri River R. R 775,454.19 \" Dubuque & Sioux City R. R 1,226,558.32 \" A portion of these had been selected as swamp lands by the State, under the act of September 28, 1850, and these, by the terms of the act of August 3, 1854, could not be turned over to the railroads unless the claim of the State to them as swamp was first rejected. It was not possible to determine from the records of the State Land Office the extent of the conflicting claims arising under the two grants, as copies of the swamp land selections in some of the counties were not filed of record. The Commissioner of the General Land Office, however, prepared lists of the lands claimed by the State as swamp under act of September 28, 1850, and also claimed by the railroad companies under act of May 15, 1856, amounting to 553,293.33 acres, the claim to which as swamp had been rejected by the Department. These were consequently certified to the State as railroad lands. There was no mode other than the act of July, 1856, prescribed for transferring the title to these lands from the State to the companies. The courts had decided that, for the purposes of the grant, the lands belonged to the State, and to her the companies should look for their titles. It was generally accepted that the act of the Legislature of July, 1856, was all that was neces sary to complete the transfer of title. It was assumed that all the rights and powers conferred upon the State by the act of Congress of May 14, 1856, were by the act of the General Assembly transferred to the companies ; in other words, that it was designed to put the companies in the place of the State as the grantees from Congress \u2014 and, therefore, that which perfected the title thereto to the State perfected the title to the companies by virtue of the act of July, 1856. One of the companies, however, the Burlington & Missouri River Rail road Company, was not entirely satisfied with this construction. Its managers thought that some further and specific action of the State authorities in addition to the act of the Legislature was necessary to complete their title. This induced Gov. Lowe to attach to the certified lists his official certificate, under the broad seal of the State. On the 9th of November, 1859, the Governor thus certified to them (commencing at the Missouri River) 187.207.44 acres, and December 27th, 43,775.70 acres, an aggregate of 231,073.14 acres. These were the only"], [213, "215 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. lands under the grant that were certified by the State authorities with any design of perfecting the title already vested in the company by the act of July, 1856. The lists which were afterward furnished to the company were simply certified by the Governor as being correct copies of the lists received by the State from the United States General Land Office. These subsequent lists embraced lands that had been claimed by the State under the Swamp Land Grant. It was urged against the claim of the Companies that the effect of the act of the Legislature was simply to substitute them for the State as parties to the grant. 1st. That the lands were granted to the State to be held in trust for the accomplishment of a specific purpose, and therefore the State could not part with the title until that purpose should have been accomplished. 2d. That it was not the intention of the act of July 14, 1856, to deprive the State of the con trol of the lands, but on the contrary that she should retain supervision of them and the right to withdraw all rights and powers and resume the title condition ally conferred by that act upon the companies in the event of their failure to complete their part of the contract. 3d. That the certified lists from the Gen eral Land Office vested the title in the State only by virtue of the act of Con gress approved August 3, 1854. The State Land Office held that the proper construction of the act of July 14, 1856, when accepted by the companies, was that it became a conditional contract that might ripen into a positive sale of the lands as from time to time the work should progress, and as the State thereby became authorized by the express terms of the grant to sell them. This appears to have been the correct construction of the act, but by a sub sequent act of Congress, approved June 2, 1864, amending the act of 1856, the terms of the grant were changed, and numerous controversies arose between the companies and the State. The ostensible purpose of this additional act was to allow the Davenport & Council Bluffs Railroad \"to modify or change the location of the uncompleted portion of its line,\" to run through the town of Newton, Jasper County, or as nearly as practicable to that point. The original grant had been made to the State to aid in the construction of railroads within its limits and not to the com panies, but Congress, in 1864, appears to have been utterly ignorant of what had been done under the act of 1856, or, if not, to have utterly disregarded it. The State had accepted the original grant. The Secretary of the Interior had already certified to the State all the lands intended to be included in the grant within fifteen miles of the lines of the several railroads. It will be remembered that Section 4, of the act of May 15, 1856, specifies the manner of sale of these lands from time to time as work on the railroads should progress, and also provided that \"if any of said roads are not completed within ten years, no fur ther sale shall be made, and the lands unsold shall revert to the United States.\" Having vested the title to these lands in trust, in the State of Iowa, it is plain that until the expiration of the ten years there could be no reversion, and the State, not the United States, must control them until the grant should expire by limitation. The United States authorities could not rightfully require the Secretary of the Interior to certify directly to the companies any portion of the lands already certified to the State. And yet Congress, by its act of June 2, 1864, provided that whenever the Davenport & Council Bluffs Railroad Com pany should file in the General Land Office at Washington a map definitely showing such new location, the Secretary of the Interior should cause to be cer tified and conveyed to said Company, from time to time, as the road progressed, out of any of the lands belonging to the United States, not sold, reserved, or"], [214, "216 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. otherwise disposed of, or to which a pre-emption claim or right of homestead had not attached, and on which a bona fide settlement and improvement had not been made under color of title derived from the United States or from the State of Iowa, within six miles of such newly located line, an amount of land per mile equal to that originally authorized to be granted to aid in the construction of said road by the act to which this was an amendment. The term \" out of any lands belonging to the United States, not sold, re served or otherwise disposed of, etc.,\" would seem to indicate that Congress did intend to grant lands already granted, but when it declared that the Company should have an amount per mile equal to that originally authorized to be granted, it is plain that the framers of the bill were ignorant of the real terms of the original grant, or that they designed that the United States should resume the title it had already parted with two years before the lands could revert to the United States under the original act, which was not repealed. A similar change was made in relation to the Cedar Rapids & Missouri Railroad, and dictated the conveyance of lands in a similar manner. Like provision was made for the Dubuque & Sioux City Railroad, and the Company was permitted to change the location of its line between Fort Dodge and Sioux City, so as to secure the best route between those points ; but this change of location was not to impair the right to the land granted in the orig inal act, nor did it change the location of those lands. By the same act, the Mississippi & Missouri Railroad Company was author ized to transfer and assign all or any part of the grant to any other company or person, \" if, in the opinion of said Company, the construction of said railroad across the State of Iowa would be thereby sooner and more satisfactorily com pleted ; but such assignee should not in any case be released from the liabilities and .conditions accompanying this grant, nor acquire perfect title in any other manner than the same would have been acquired by the original grantee.\" Still further, the Burlington & Missouri River Railroad was not forgotten, and was, by the same act, empowered to receive an amount of land per mile equal to that mentioned in the original act, and if that could not be found within the limits of six miles from the line of said road, then such selection might be made along such line within twenty miles thereof out of any public lands belonging to the United States, not sold, reserved or otherwise disposed of, or to which a pre-emption claim or right of homestead had not attached. Those acts of Congress, which evidently originated in the \"lobby,\" occa sioned much controversy and trouble. The Department of the Interior, how ever, recognizing the fact that when the Secretary had certified the lands to the State, under the act of 1856, that act divested the United States of title, under the vesting act of August, 1854, refused to review its action, and also refused to order any and all investigations for establishing adverse claims (except in pre-emption cases), on the ground that the United States had parted with the title, and, therefore, could exercise no control over the land. May 12, 1864, before the passage of the amendatory act above described, Congress granted to the State of Iowa, to aid in the construction of a railroad from McGregor to Sioux City, and for the benefit of the McGregor AVestern Railroad Company, every alternate section of land, designated by odd numbers, for ten sections in width on each side of the proposed road, reserving the right to substitute other lands whenever it was found that the grant infringed upon pre-empted lands, or on lands that had been reserved or disposed of for any other purpose. In such cases, the Secretary of the Interior was instructed to select, in lieu, lands belonging to the United States lying nearest to the limits specified."], [215, "217 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. X. \u2014 AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE AND FARM LANDS. An Agricultural College and Model Farm was established by act of the General Assembly, approved March 22, 1858. By the eleventh section of the act, the proceeds of the five-section grant made for the purpose of aiding in the erection of public buildings was appropriated, subject to the approval of Con gress, together with all lands that Congress might thereafter grant to the State for the purpose, for the benefit of the institution. On the 23d of March, by joint resolution, the Legislature asked the consent of Congress to the proposed transfer. By act approved July 11, 1862, Congress removed the restrictions imposed in the \"five-section grant,\" and authorized the General Assembly to make such disposition of the lands as should be deemed best for the interests of the State. By these several acts, the five sections of land in Jasper County certified to the State to aid in the erection of public buildings under the act of March 3, 1845, entitled \" An act supplemental to the act for the admission of the States of Iowa and Florida into the Union,\" were fully appropriated for the benefit of the Iowa Agricultural College and Farm. The institution is located in Story County. Seven hundred and twenty-one acres in that and two hundred in Boone County were donated to it by individuals interested in the success of the enterprise. By act of Congress approved July 2, 1862, an appropriation was made to each State and Territory of 30,000 acres for each Senator and Representative in Congress, to which, by the apportionment under the census. of 1860, they were respectively entitled. This grant was made for the purpose of endowing colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts. Iowa accepted this grant by an act passed at an extra session of its Legis lature, approved September 11, 1862, entitled \"An act to accept of the grant, and carry into execution the trust conferred upon the State of Iowa by an act of Congress entitled ' An act granting public lands to the several States and Territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts,' approved July 2, 1862.\" This act made it the duty of the Governor to appoint an agent to select and locate the lands, and provided that none should be selected that were claimed by any county as swamp lands. The agent was required to make report of his doings to the Governor, who was instructed to submit the list of selections to the Board of Trustees of the Agricultural College for their approval. One thousand dollars were appro priated to carry the law into effect. The State, having two Senators and six Representatives in Congress, was entitled to 240,000 acres of land under this grant, for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an Agricultural College. Peter Melendy, Esq., of Black Hawk County, was appointed to make the selec tions, and during August, September and December, 1863, located them in the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Sioux City Land Districts. December 8, 1864, these selections were certified by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and were approved to the State by the Secretary of the Interior December 13, 1864. The title to these lands was vested in the State in fee simple, and con flicted with no other claims under other grants. The agricultural lands were approved to the State as 240,000.96 acres ; but as 35,691.66 aeres were located within railroad limits, which were computed at the rate of two acres for one, the actual amount of land approved to the State under this grant was only 204,309.30 acres, located as follows: In Des Moines Land District 6,804.96 acres, In Sioux City Land District 59,025.37 \" In Fort Dodge Land District 138,478.97 \""], [216, "218 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. By act of the General Assembly, approved March 29, 1864, entitled, \" An act authorizing the Trustees of the Iowa State Agricultural College and Farm to sell all lands acquired, granted, donated or appropriated for the benefit of said college, and to make an investment of the proceeds thereof,\" all these lands were granted to the Agricultural College and Farm, and the Trustees were au thorized to take possession, and sell or lease them. They were then, under the control of the Trustees, lands as follows : Under the act of July 2, 1852 204,309.30 acres. Of the five-section grant 3,200.00 \" Lands donated in Story County 721.00 \" Lands donated in Boone County 200.00 \" Total 208,430.30 acres. The Trustees opened an office at Fort Dodge, and appointed Hon. G. AV- Bassett their agent for the sale of these lands. THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. The germ of the free public school system of Iowa, which now ranks sec ond to none in the United States, was planted by the first settlers. They had migrated to the \" The Beautiful Land \" from other and older States, where the common school system had been tested by many years' experience, bringing with them some knowledge of its advantages, which they determined should be enjoyed by the children of the land of their adoption. The system thus planted was expanded and improved in the broad fields of the West, until now it is justly considered one of the most complete, comprehensive and liberal in the country. Nor is this to be wondered at when it is remembered humble log school houses were built almost as soon as the log cabin of the earliest settlers were occupied by their brave builders. In the lead mining regions of the State, the first to be occupied by the white race, the hardy pioneers provided the means for the education of their children even before they had comfortable dwellings for their families. School teachers were among the first immigrants to Iowa. AVherever a little settlement was made, the school house was the first united public act of the settlers; and the rude, primitive structures of the early time only disappeared when the communities had increased in population and wealth, and were able to replace them with more commodious and comfortable buildings. Perhaps in no single instance has the magnificent progress of the State of Iowa been more marked and rapid than in her common school system and in her school houses, which, long since, superseded the log cabins of the first settlers. To day, the school houses which everywhere dot the broad and fertile prairies of Iowa are unsurpassed by those of any other State in the great Union. More especially is this true in all her cities and villages, where liberal and lavish appropriations have been voted, by a generous people, for the erection of large, commodious and elegant buildings, furnished with all the modern improvements, and costing from $10,000 to $60,000 each. The people of the State have ex pended more than $10,000,000 for the erection of public school buildings. The first house erected in Iowa was a log cabin at Dubuque, built by James L. Langworthy and a few other miners, in the Autumn of 1833. AVhen it was completed, George Cabbage was employed as teacher during the Winter of 1833-4, and thirty-five pupils attended his school. Barrett AVhittemore taught the second term with twenty-five pupils in attendance. Mrs. Caroline Dexter"], [217, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 219 commenced teaching in Dubuque in March, 1836. She was the first female teacher there, and probably the first in Iowa. In 1839, Thomas H. Benton, Jr., afterward for ten years Superintendent of Public Instruction, opened an English and classical school in Dubuque. The first tax for the support of schools at Dubuque was levied in 1840. Among the first buildings erected at Burlington was a commodious log school house in 1834, in which Mr. Johnson Pierson taught the first school in the Winter of 1834-5. The first school in Muscatine County was taught by George Bumgardner, in the Spring of 1837, and in 1839, a log school house was erected in Musca tine, which served for a long time for school house, church and public hall. The first school in Davenport was taught in 1838. In Fairfield, Miss Clarissa Sawyer, James F. Chambers and Mrs. Reed taught school in 1839. When the site of Iowa City was selected as the capital of the Territory of Iowa, in May, 1839, it was a perfect wilderness. The first sale of lots took place August 18, 1839, and before January 1, 1840, about twenty families had settled within the limits of the town ; and during the same year, Mr. Jesse Berry opened a school in a small frame building he had erected, on what is now College street. The first settlement in Monroe County was made in 1843, by Mr. John R. Gray, about two miles from the present site of Eddy ville; and in the Summer of 1844, a log school house was built by Gray, AVilliam V. Beedle, C. Renfro, Joseph McMullen and AVilloughby Randolph, and the first school was opened by Miss Urania Adams. The building was occupied for school purposes for nearly ten years. About a year after the first cabin was built at Oskaloosa, a log school house was built, in which school was opened by Samuel AV. Caldwell in 1844. At Fort Des Moines, now the capital of the State, the first school was taught by Lewis AVhitten, Clerk of the District Court in the Winter of 1846-7, in one of the rooms on \" Coon Row,\" built for barracks. The first school in Pottawattomie County was opened by George Green, a Mormon, at Council Point, prior to 1849 ; and until about 1854, nearly, if not quite, all the teachers in that vicinity were Mormons. The first school in Decorah was taught in 1853, by T. AV. Burdick, then a young man of seventeen. In Osceola, the first school was opened by Mr. D. W. Scoville. The first school at Fort Dodge was taught in 1855, by Cyrus C. Carpenter, since Governor of the State. In Crawford County, the first school house was built in Mason's Grove, in 1856, and Morris McHenry first occupied it as teacher. During the first twenty years of the history of Iowa, the log school house pre vailed, and in 1861, there were 893 of these primitive structures in use for school purposes in the State. Sinee that time they have been gradually dis appearing. In 1865, there were 796; in 1870, 336, and in 1875, 121. Iowa Territory was created July 3, 1838. January 1, 1839, the Territorial Legislature passed an act providing that \" there shall be established a common school, or schools in each of the counties in this Territory, which shall be open and free for every class of white citizens between the ages of five and twenty-one years.\" The second section of the act provided that \" the County Board shall, from time to time, form such districts in their respective counties whenever a petition may be presented for the purpose by a majority of the voters resident within such contemplated district.\" These districts were gov erned by boards of trustees, usually of three persons ; each district was required"], [218, "220 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. to maintain school at least three months in every year ; and later, laws were enacted providing for county school taxes for the payment of teachers, and that whatever additional sum might be required should be assessed upon the parents sending, in proportion to the length of time sent. When Iowa Territory became a State, in 1846, with a population of 100, 000, and with 20,000 scholars within its limits, about four hundred school dis tricts had been organized. In 1850, there were 1,200, and in 1857, the number had increased to 3,265. In March, 1858, upon the recommendation of Hon. M. L. Fisher, then Su perintendent of Public Instruction, the Seventh General Assembly enacted that \" each civil township is declared a school district,\" and provided that these should be divided into sub-districts. This law went into force March 20, 1858, and reduced the number of school districts from about 3,500 to less than 900. This change of school organization resulted in a very material reduction of the expenditures for the compensation of District Secretaries and Treasurers. An effort was made for several years, from 1867 to 1872, to abolish the sub district system. Mr. Kissell, Superintendent, recommended, in his report of January 1, 1872, and Governor Merrill forcibly endorsed his views in his annual message. But the Legislature of that year provided for the formation of inde pendent districts from the sub-districts of district townships. The system of graded schools was inaugurated in 1849 ; and new schools, in which more than one teacher is employed, are universally graded. The first official mention of Teachers' Institutes in the educational records of Iowa occurs in the annual report of Hon. Thomas H. Benton, Jr., made December 2, 1850, who said, \" An institution of this character was organized a few years ago, composed of the teachers of the mineral regions of Illinois, AVisconsin and Iowa. An association of teachers has, also, been formed in the county of Henry, and an effort was made in October last to organize a regular institute in the county of Jones.\" At that time \u2014 although the beneficial influence of these institutes was admitted, it was urged that the expenses of attending them was greater than teachers with limited compensation were able to bear. To obviate this objection, Mr. Benton recommended that \" the sum of $150 should be appropriated annually for three years, to be drawn in install ments of $50 each by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and expended for these institutions.\" He proposed that three institutes should be held annu ally at points to be designated by the Superintendent. No legislation in this direction, however, was had until March, 1858, when an act was passed authorizing the holding of teachers' institutes for periods not less than six working days, whenever not less than thirty teachers should desire. The Superintendent was authorized to expend not exceeding $100 for any one institute, to be paid out by the County Superintendent as the institute might direct for teachers and lecturers, and one thousand dollars was appropriated to defray the expenses of these institutes. December 6, 1858, Mr. Fisher reported to the Board of Education that institutes had been appointed in twenty counties within the preceding six months, and more would have been, but the appropriation had been exhausted. The Board of Education at its first session, commencing December 6, 1858, enacted a code of school laws which retained the existing provisions for teachers' institutes. In March, 1860, the General Assembly amended the act of the Board by appropriating \" a sum not exceeding fifty dollars annually for one such institute, held as provided by law in each county.\""], [219, "221 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. In 1865, Mr. Faville reported that \" the provision made by the State for the benefit of teachers' institutes has never been so fully appreciated, both by the people and the teachers, as during the last two years.\" By act approved March 19, 1874, Normal Institutes were established in each county, to be held annually by the County Superintendent. This was regarded as a very decided step in advance by Mr. Abernethy, and in 1876 the Sixteenth General Assembly established the first permanent State Normal School at Cedar Falls, Black Hawk County, appropriating the building and property of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home at that place for that purpose. This school is now \" in the full tide of successful experiment.\" The public school system of Iowa is admirably organized, and if the various officers who are entrusted with the educational interests of the commonwealth are faithful and competent, should and will constantly improve. \" The public schools are supported by funds arising from several sources. The sixteenth section of every Congressional Township was set apart by the General Government for school purposes, being one-thirty-sixth part of all the lands of the State. The minimum price of these lands was fixed at one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre. Congress also made an additional donation to the State of five hundred thousand acres, and an appropriation of five per cent. on all the sales of public lands to the school fund. The State gives to this fund the proceeds of the sales of all lands which escheat to it ; the proceeds of all fines for the violation of the liquor and criminal laws. The money derived from these sources constitutes the permanent school fund of the State, which cannot be diverted to any other purpose. The penalties collected by the courts for fines and forfeitures go to the school fund in the counties where collected. The proceeds of the sale of lands and the five per cent, fund go into the State Treasury, and the State distributes these proceeds to the several counties accord ing to their request, and the counties loan the money to individuals for long terms at eight per cent, interest, on security of land valued at three times the amount of the loan, exclusive of all buildings and improvements thereon. The interest on these loans is paid into the State Treasury, and becomes the avail able school fund of the State. The counties are responsible to the State for all money so loaned, and the State is likewise responsible to the school fund for all moneys transferred to the counties. The interest on these loans is apportioned by the State Auditor semi-annually to the several counties of the State, in pro portion to the number of persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years. The counties also levy an annual tax for school purposes, which is apportioned to the several district townships in the same way. A district tax is also levied for the same purpose. The money arising from these several sources constitutes the support of the public schools, and is sufficient to enable every sub-district in the State to afford from six to nine months' school each year.\" The taxes levied for the support of schools are self-imposed. Under the admirable school laws of the State, no taxes can be legally assessed or collected for the erection of school houses until they have been ordered by the election of the district at a school meeting legally called. The school houses of Iowa are the pride of the State and an honor to the people. If they have been some times built at a prodigal expense, the tax payers have no one to blame but themselves. The teachers' and contingent funds are determined by the Board of Directors under certain legal restrictions. These boards are elected annually, except in the independent districts, in which the board may be entirely changed every three years. The only exception to this mode of levying taxes for support"], [220, "222 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. of schools is the county school tax, which is determined by the County Board of Supervisors. The tax is from one to three mills on the dollar ; usually, however, but one. Mr. Abernethy, who was Superintendent of Public Instruc tion from 1872 to 1877, said in one of his reports: There is but little opposition to the levy of taxes for the support of schools, and there would be still less if the funds were always properly guarded and judiciously expended. How ever much our people disagree upon other subjects, they are practically united upon this. The opposition of wealth has long since ceased to exist, and our wealthy men are usually the most liberal in their views and the most active friends of popular education. They are often found upon our school boards, and usually make the best of school officers. It is not uncommon for Boards of Directors, especially in the larger towns and cities, to be composed wholly of men who represent the enterprise, wealth and business of their cities. At the close of 1877, there were 1,086 township districts, 3,138 indepen dent districts and 7,015 sub-districts. There were 9,948 ungraded and 476 graded schools, with an average annual session of seven months and five days. There were 7,348 male teachers employed, whose average compensation was $34.88 per month, and 12,518 female teachers, with an average compensation of $28.69 per month. The number of persons between the ages 5 and 21 years, in 1877, was 567,859; number enrolled in public schools, 421,163; total average attendance, 251,372; average cost of tuition per month, $1.62. There are 9,279 frame, 671 brick, 257 stone and 89 log school houses, making a grand total of 10,296, valued at $9,044,973. The public school libraries number 17,329 volumes. Ninety-nine teachers' institutes were held during 1877. Teachers' salaries amounted to $2,953,645. There was expended for school houses, grounds, libraries and apparatus, $1,106,788, and for fuel and other contingencies, $1,136,995, making the grand total of $5,197,428 expended by the generous people of Iowa for the support of their magnificent public schools in a single year. The amount of the permanent school fund, at the close of 1877, was $3,462,000. Annual interest, $276,960. In 1857, there were 3,265 independent districts, 2,708 ungraded schools, and 1,572 male and 1,424 female teachers. Teachers' salaries amounted to $198,142, and the total expenditures for schools was only $364,515. Six hun dred and twenty-three volumes were the extent of the public school libraries twenty years ago, and there were only 1,686 school houses, valued at $571,064. In twenty years, teachers' salaries have increased from $198,142, in 1857, to $2,953,645 in 1877. Total school expenditures, from $364,515 to $5,197,428. The significance of such facts as these is unmistakable. Such lavish expen ditures can only be accounted for by the liberality and public spirit of the people, all of whom manifest their love of popular education and their faith in the public schools by the annual dedication to their support of more than one per cent, of their entire taxable property ; this, too, uninterruptedly through a series of years, commencing in the midst of a war which taxed their energies and resources to the extreme, and continuing through years of general depression in business \u2014 years of moderate yield of produce, of discouragingly low prices, and even amid the scanty surroundings and privations of pioneer life. Few human enterprises have a grander significance or give evidence of a more noble purpose than the generous contributions from the scanty resources of the pioneer for the purposes of public education."], [221, "223 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA.

The State of Iowa may well be proud of her record during the AVar of the Rebellion, from 1861 to 1865. The following brief but comprehensive sketch of the history she made during that trying period is largely from the pen of Col. A. P. AVood, of Dubuque, the author of \"The History of Iowa and the AVar,\" one of the best works of the kind yet written. \" AVhether in the promptitude of her responses to the calls made on her by the General Government, in the courage and constancy of her soldiery in the field, or in the wisdom and efficiency with which her civil administration was conducted during the trying period covered by the AVar of the Rebellion, Iowa proved herself the peer of any loyal State. The proclamation of her Governor, responsive to that of the President, calling for volunteers to compose her First Regiment, was issued on the fourth day after the fall of Sumter. At the end of only a single week, men enough were reported to be in quarters (mostly in the vicinity of their own homes) to fill the regiment. These, however, were hardly more than a tithe of the number who had been offered by company com manders for acceptance under the President's call. So urgent were these offers that the Governor requested (on the 24th of April) permission to organize an additional regiment. AVhile awaiting an answer to this request, he conditionally accepted a sufficient number of companies to compose two additional regiments. In a short time, he was notified that both of these would be accepted. Soon after the completion of the Second and Third Regiments (which was near the close of May), the Adjutant General of the State reported that upward of one hundred and seventy companies had been tendered to the Governor to serve against the enemies of the LTnion. \" Much difficulty and considerable delay occured in fitting these regiments for the field. For the First Infantry a complete outfit (not uniform) of clothing was extemporized \u2014 principally by the volunteered labor of loyal women in the different towns \u2014 from material of various colors and qualities, obtained within the limits of the State. The same was done in part for the Second Infantry. Meantime, an extra session of the General Assembly had been called by the Governor, to convene on the 15th of May. With but little delay, that body authorized a loan of $800,000, to meet the extraordinary expenses incurred, and to be incurred, by the Executive Department, in consequence of the new emer gency. A wealthy merchant of the State (Ex-Governor Merrill, then a resident of McGregor) immediately took from the Governor a contract to supply a com plete outfit of clothing for the three regiments organized, agreeing to receive, should the Governor so elect, his pay therefor in State bonds at par. This con-"], [226, "230 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. tract he executed to the letter, and a portion of the clothing (which was manu factured in Boston, to his order) was delivered at Keokuk, the place at which the troops had rendezvoused, in exactly one month from the day on which the contract had been entered into. The remainder arrived only a few days later. This clothing was delivered to the regiment, but was subsequently condemned by the Government, for the reason that its color was gray, and blue had been adopted as the color to be worn by the national troops.\" Other States also clothed their troops, sent forward under the first call of President Lincoln, with gray uniforms, but it was soon found that the con federate forces were also clothed in gray, and that color was at once abandoned by the Union troops. If both armies were clothed alike, annoying if not fatal mistakes were liable to be made. But while engaged in these efforts to discharge her whole duty in common with all the other Union-loving States in the great emergency, Iowa was compelled to make immediate and ample provision for the protection of her own borders, from threatened invasion on the south by the Secessionists of Missouri, and from danger of incursions from the west and northwest by bands of hostile Indians, who were freed from the usual restraint imposed upon them by the presence of regular troops stationed at the frontier posts. These troops were withdrawn to meet the greater and more pressing danger threatening the life of the nation at its very heart. To provide for the adequate defense of her borders from the ravages of both rebels in arms against the Government and of the more irresistible foes from the AArestern plains, the Governor of the State was authorized to raise and equip two regiments of infantry, a squadron of cavalry (not less than five companies) and a battalion of artillery (not less than three companies.) Only cavalry were enlisted for home defense, however, \"but,\" says Col. AVood, \"in times of special danger, or when calls were made by the Unionists of Northern Missouri for assistance against their disloyal enemies, large numbers of militia on foot often turned out, and remained in the field until the necessity for their services had passed. \" The first order for the Iowa volunteers to move to the field was received on the 13th of June. It was issued by Gen. Lyon, then commanding the United States forces in Missouri. The First and Second Infantry immediately embarked in steamboats, and moved to Hannibal. Some two weeks later, the Third Infantry was ordered to the same point. These three, together with many other of the earlier organized Iowa regiments, rendered their first field service in Missouri. The First Infantry formed a part of the little army with which Gen. Lyon moved on Springfield, and fought the bloody battle of AArilson's Creek. It received unqualified praise for its gallant bearing on the field. In the following month (September), the Third Iowa, with but very slight support, fought with honor the sanguinary engagement of Blue Mills standing ; and in November, the Seventh dowa, as a part of a force commanded by Gen. Grant, greatly distinguished itself in the battle of Belmont, where it poured out its blood like water \u2014 losing more than half of the men it took into action. \" The initial operations in which the battles referred to took place were fol lowed by the more important movements led by Gen. Grant, Gen. Curtis, of this State, and other commanders, which resulted in defeating the armies defending the chief strategic lines held by the Confederates in Kentucky, Tenn nessee, Missouri and Arkansas, and compelling their withdrawal from much of the territory previously controlled by them in those States. In these and other movements, down to the grand culminating campaign by which A7icksburg was"], [227, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 231 captured and the Confederacy permanently severed on the line of the Mississippi River, Iowa troops took part in steadily increasing numbers. In the investment and siege of Vicksburg, the State was represented by thirty regiments and two batteries, in addition to which, eight regiments and one battery were employed on theputposts of the besieging army. The brilliancy of their exploits on the many fields where they served won for them the highest meed of praise, both in military and civil circles. Multiplied were the terms in which expression was given to this sentiment, but these words of one of the journals of a neigh boring State, 'The Iowa troops have been heroes among heroes,' embody the spirit of all. \" In the veteran re-enlistments that distinguished the closing months of 1863 above all other periods in the history of re-enlistments for the national armies, the Iowa three years' men (who were relatively more numerous than those of any other State) were prompt to set the example of volunteering for another term of equal length, thereby adding many thousands to the great army of those who gave this renewed and practical assurance that the cause of the Union should not be left without defenders. \"In all the important movements of 1864-65, by which the Confederacy was penetrated in every quarter, and its military power finally overthrown, the Iowa troops took part. Their drum-beat was heard on the banks of every great river of the Soutb, from the Potomac to the Rio Grande, and everywhere they rendered the same faithful and devoted service, maintaining on all occasions their wonted reputation for valor in the field and endurance on the march. \" Two Iowa three-year cavalry regiments were employed during their whole term of service in the operations that were in progress from 1863 to 1866 against the hostile Indians of the western plains. A portion of these men were among the last of the volunteer troops to be mustered out of service. The State also supplied a considerable number of men to the navy, who took part in most of the naval operations prosecuted against the Confederate power on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and the rivers of the West. \" The people of Iowa were early and constant workers in the sanitary field, and by their liberal gifts and personal efforts for the benefit of the soldiery, placed their State in the front rank of those who became distinguished for their exhibitions of patriotic benevolence during the period covered by the war. Agents appointed by the Governor were stationed at points convenient for ren dering assistance to the sick and needy soldiers of the State, while others were employed in visiting, from time to time, hospitals, camps and armies in the field, and doing whatever the circumstances rendered possible for the health and comfort of such of the Iowa soldiery as might be found there. \" Some of the benevolent people of the State early conceived the idea of establishing a Home for such of the children of deceased soldiers as might be left in destitute circumstances. This idea first took form in 1863, and in the following year a Home was opened at Farmington, Van Buren County, in a building leased for that purpose, and which soon became filled to its utmost capacity. The institution received liberal donations from the general public, and also from the soldiers in the field. In 1865, it became necessary to pro vide increased accommodations for the large number of children who were seeking the benefits of its care. This was done by establishing a branch at Cedar Falls, in Black Hawk County, and by securing, during the same year, for the use of the parent Home, Camp Kinsman near the City of Davenport. This property was soon afterward donated to the institution, by act of Congress."], [228, "232 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. \" In 1866, in pursuance of a law enacted for that purpose, the Soldiers' Orphans' Home (which then contained about four hundred and fifty inmates) became a State institution, and thereafter the sums necessary for its support were appropriated from the State treasury. A second branch was established at Glenwood, Mills County. Convenient tracts were secured, and valuable improve ments made at all the different points. Schools were also established, and em ployments provided for such of the children as were of suitable age. In all ways the provision made for these wards of the State has been such as to chal lenge the approval of every benevolent mind. The number of children who have been inmates of the Home from its foundation to the present time is considerably more than two thousand. \" At the beginning of the war, the population of Iowa included about one hundred and fifty thousand men presumably liable to render military service. The State raised, for general service, thirty-nine regiments of infantry, nine regiments of cavalry, and four companies of artillery, composed of three years' men ; one regiment of infantry, composed of three months' men ; and four regi ments and one battalion of infantry, composed of one hundred clays' men. The original enlistments in these various organizations, including seventeen hundred and twenty-seven men raised by draft, numbered a little more than sixty-nine thousand. The re-enlistments, including upward of seven thousand veterans, numbered very nearly eight thousand. The enlistments in the regular army and navy, and organizations of other States, will, if added, raise the total to upward of eighty thousand. The number of men who, under special enlistments, and as militia, took part at different times in the operations on the exposed borders of the State, was probably as many as five thousand. \" Iowa paid no bounty on account of the men she placed in the field. In some instances, toward the close of the war, bounty to a comparatively small amount was paid by cities and towns. On only one occasion \u2014 that of the call of July 18, 1864 \u2014 was a draft made in Iowa. This did not occur on account of her proper liability, as established by previous rulings of the AVar Department, to supply men under that call, but grew out of the great necessity that there existed for raising men. The Government insisted on temporarily setting aside, in part, the former rule of settlements, and enforcing a draft in all cases where subdistricts in any of the States should be found deficient in their supply of men. In no instance was Iowa, as a whole, found to be indebted to the General Government for men, on a settlement of her quota accounts.\" It is to be said to the honor and credit of Iowa that whde many of the loyal States, older and larger in population and wealth, incurred heavy State debts for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations to the General Government, Iowa, while she was foremost in duty, while she promptly discharged all her obligations to her sister States and the Union, found herself at the close of the war without any material addition to her pecuniary liabilities incurred before the war com menced. Upon final settlement after the restoration of peace, her claims upon the Federal Government were found to be fully equal to the amount of her bonds issued and sold during the war to provide the means for raising and equipping her troops sent into the field, and to meet the inevitable demands upon her treasury in consequence of the war."], [229, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA 233 dNFANTRY.

Area, 55,410 square miles, or 35,462,400 acres. Illinois, as regards its surface, constitutes a table-land at a varying elevation ranging between 350 and 800 feet above the sea level ; composed of extensive and highly fertile prairies and plains. Much of the south division of the State, especially the river-bottoms, are thickly wooded. The prairies, too, have oasis-like clumps of trees scattered here and there at intervals. The chief rivers irrigating the State are the Mississippi \u2014 dividing it from Iowa and Missouri \u2014 the Ohio (forming its south barrier), the Illinois, Wabash, Kaskaskia, and San gamon, with their numerous affluents. The total extent of navigable streams is calculated at 4,000 miles. Small lakes are scattered over vari ous parts of the State. Illinois is extremely prolific in minerals, chiefly coal, iron, copper, and zinc ores, sulphur and limestone. The coal-field alone is estimated to absorb a full third of the entire coal-deposit of North America. Climate tolerably equable and healthy ; the mean temperature standing at about 51\u00b0 Fahrenheit As an agricultural region, Illinois takes a competitive rank with neighboring States, the cereals, fruits, and root crops yielding plentiful returns ; in fact, as a grain-growing State, Illinois may be deemed, in proportion to her size, to possess a greater area of lands suitable for its production than any other State in the Union. Stock raising is also largely carried on, while her manufacturing interests in regard of woolen fabrics, etc., are on a very extensive and yearly expand ing scale. The lines of railroad in the State are among the most exten sive of the Union. Inland water-carriage is facilitated by a canal connecting the Illinois River with Lake Michigan, and thence with the St. Lawrence and Atlantic. Illinois is divided into 102 counties ; the chief towns being Chicago, Springfield (capital), Alton, Quincy, Peoria, Galena, Bloomington, Rock Island, Vandalia, etc. By the new Consti tution, established in 1870, the State Legislature consists of 51 Senators, elected for four years, and 153 Representatives, for two years ; which numbers were to be decennially increased thereafter to the number of six per every additional half-million of inhabitants. Religious and educational institutions are largely diffused throughout, and are in a very flourishing condition.

At the same period the value of assessed and equalized property presented the following totals: assessed, $840,031,703 ; equal ized $480,664,058. The name of Illinois, through nearly the whole of the eighteenth century, embraced most of the known regions north and west of Ohio. French colonists established themselves in 1673, at Cahokia and Kaskaskia, and the territory of which these settlements formed the nucleus was, in 1763, ceded to Great Britain in conjunction with Canada, and ultimately resigned to the United States in 1787.

The profile of Indiana forms a nearly exact parallelogram, occupy ing one of the most fertile portions of the great Mississippi Valley. The greater extent of the surface embraced within its limits consists of gentle undulations rising into hilly tracts toward the Ohio bottom. The chief rivers of the State are the Ohio and Wabash, with their numerous affluents. The soil is highly productive of the cereals and grasses \u2014 most particularly so in the valleys of the Ohio, Wabash, Whitewater, and White Rivers. The northeast and central portions are well timbered with virgin forests, and the west section is notably rich in coal, constitut ing an offshoot of the great Illinois carboniferous field. Iron, copper, marble, slate, gypsum, and various clays are also abundant. From an agricultural point of view, the staple products are maize and wheat, with the other cereals in lesser yields ; and besides these, flax, hemp, sorghum, hops, etc., are extensively raised. Indiana is divided into 92 counties, and counts among her principal cities and towns, those of Indianapolis (the capital), Fort Wayne, Evansville, Terre Haute, Madison, Jefferson ville, Columbus, Vincennes, South Bend, etc. The public institutions of the State are many and various, and on a scale of magnitude and efficiency commensurate with her important political and industrial status. Upward of two thousand miles of railroads permeate the State in all directions, and greatly conduce to the development of her expanding manufacturing interests. Statistics for the fiscal year terminating October 31, 1870, exhibited a total of receipts, $3,896,541 as against dis bursements, $3,532,406, leaving a balance, $364,135 in favor of the State Treasury. The entire public debt, January 5, 1871, $3,971,000. This State was first settled by Canadian voyageurs in 1702, who erected a fort at Vincennes ; in 1763 it passed into the hands of the English, and was by the latter ceded to the United States in 1783. From 1788 till 1791, an Indian warefare prevailed. In 1800, all the region west and north of Ohio (then formed into a distinct territory) became merged in Indiana. In 1809, the present limits of the State were defined, Michigan and Illinois having previously been withdrawn. In 1811, Indiana was the theater of the Indian War of Tecumseh, ending with the decisive battle of Tippecanoe. In 1816 (December 11), Indiana became enrolled among the States of the American Union. In 1834, the State passed through a monetary crisis owing to its having become mixed up with railroad, canal, and other speculations on a gigantic scale, which ended, for the time being, in a general collapse of public credit, and consequent bank ruptcy. Since that time, however, the greater number of the publie"], [256, "260 THE NORTHWESTERN STATES. works which had brought about that imbroglio \u2014 especially the great Wabash and Erie Canal \u2014 have been completed, to the great benefit of the State, whose subsequent progress has year by year been marked by rapid strides in the paths of wealth, commerce, and general social aud political prosperity.

In shape, Iowa presents an almost perfect parallelogram ; has a length, north to south, of about 300 miles, by a pretty even width of 208 miles, and embraces an area of 55,045 square miles, or 35,228,800 acres. The surface of the State is generally undulating, rising toward the middle into an elevated plateau which forms the \" divide \" of the Missouri and Mississippi basins. Rolling prairies, especially in the south section, constitute a regnant feature, and the river bottoms, belted with woodlands, present a soil of the richest alluvion. Iowa is well watered ; the principal rivers being the Mississippi and Missouri, which form respectively its east and west limits, and the Cedar, Iowa, and Des Moines, affluents of the first named. Mineralogically, Iowa is important as occupying a section of the great Northwest coal field, to the extent of an area estimated at 25,000 square miles. Lead, copper, zinc, and iron, are also mined in considerable quantities. The soil is well adapted to the production of wheat, maize, and the other cereals ; fruits, vegetables, and esculent roots ; maize, wheat, and oats forming the chief staples. Wine, tobacco, hops, and wax, are other noticeable items of the agricul tural yield. Cattle-raising, too, is a branch of rural industry largely engaged in. The climate is healthy, although liable to extremes of heat and cold. The annual gross product of the various manufactures carried on in this State approximate, in round numbers, a sum of $20,000,000. Iowa has an immense railroad system, besides over 500 miles of water communication by means of its navigable rivers. The State is politically divided into 99 counties, with the following centers of population : Des Moines (capital), Iowa City (former capital), Dubuque, Davenport, Bur lington, Council Bluffs, Keokuk, Muscatine, and Cedar Rapids. The State institutions of Iowa \u2014 religious, scholastic, and philanthropic \u2014 are on a par, as regards number and perfection of organization and operation, with those of her Northwest sister States, and education is especially well cared for, and largely diffused.

The south division is 416 miles long, by from 50 to 300 miles wide. Aggregate lake-shore line, 1,400 miles. The Upper, or North, Peninsula consists chiefly of an elevated plateau, expanding into the Porcupine mountain-system, attaining a maximum height of some 2,000 feet. Its shores along Lake Superior are eminently bold and picturesque, and its area is rich in minerals, its product of copper constituting an important source of industry. Both divisions are heavily wooded, and the South one, in addition, boasts of a deep, rich, loamy soil, throwing up excellent crops of cereals and other agricultural produce. The climate is generally mild and humid, though the Winter colds are severe. The chief staples of farm husbandry include the cereals, grasses, maple sugar, sorghum, tobacco, fruits, and dairy-stuffs. In 1870, the acres of land in farms were : improved, 5,096,939 ; unimproved woodland, 4,080,146 ; other unimproved land, 842,057. The cash value of land was $398,240,578 ; of farming implements and machinery, $13,711,979. In 1869, there were shipped from the Lake Superior ports, 874,582 tons of iron ore, and 45,762 of smelted pig, along with 14,188 tons of copper (ore and ingot). Coal is another article largely mined. Inland communication is provided for by an admirably organized railroad system, and by the St. Mary's Ship Canal, connecting Lakes Huron and Superior. Michigan is politically divided into 78 counties ; its chief urban centers are Detroit, Lansing (capital), Ann Arbor, Marquette, Bay City, Niles, Ypsilanti, Grand Haven, etc. The Governor of the State is elected biennially. On November 30, 1870, the aggregate bonded debt of Michigan amounted to $2,385,028, and the assessed valuation of land to $266,929,278, representing an estimated cash value of $800,000,000. Education is largely diffused and most excellently conducted and pro vided for. The State University at Ann Arbor, the colleges of Detroit and Kalamazoo, the Albion Female College, the State Normal School at Ypsilanti, and the State Agricultural College at Lansing, are chief among the academic institutions. Michigan (a term of Chippeway origin, and"], [258, "264 THE NORTHWESTERN STATES. signifying \" Great Lake), was discovered and first settled by French Canadians, who, in 1670, founded Detroit, the pioneer of a series of trad ing-posts on the Indian frontier. During the \" Conspiracy of Pontiac,\" following the French loss of Canada, Michigan became the scene of a sanguinary struggle between the whites and aborigines. In 1796, it became annexed to the United States, which incorporated this region with the Northwest Territory, and then with Indiana Territory, till 1803, when it became territorially independent. Michigan was the theater of warlike operations during the war of 1812 with Great Britain, and in 1819 was authorized to be represented by one delegate in Congress ; in 1837 she was admitted into the Union as a State, and in 1869 ratified the 15th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Population, 1,184,059. WISCONSIN. It has a mean length of 260 miles, and a maximum breadth of 215. Land area, 53,924 square miles, or 34,511,360 acres. Wisconsin lies at a considerable altitude above sea-level, and consists for the most part of an upland plateau, the surface of which is undulating and very generally diversified. Numerous local eminences called mounds are interspersed over the State, and the Lake Michigan coast-line is in many parts char acterized by lofty escarped cliffs, even as on the west side the banks of the Mississippi form a series of high and picturesque bluffs. A group of islands known as The Apostles lie off the extreme north point of the State in Lake Superior, and the great estuary of Green Bay, running far inland, gives formation to a long, narrow peninsula between its waters and those of Lake Michigan. The river-system of Wisconsin has three outlets \u2014 those of Lake Superior, Green Bay, and the Mississippi, which latter stream forms the entire southwest frontier, widening at one point into the large watery expanse called Lake Pepin. Lake Superior receives the St. Louis, Burnt Wood, and Montreal Rivers ; Green Bay, the Menomonee, Peshtigo, Oconto, and Fox ; while into the Mississippi empty the St. Croix, Chippewa, Black, Wisconsin, and Rock Rivers. The chief interior lakes are those of Winnebago, Horicon, and Court Oreilles, and smaller sheets of water stud a great part of the surface. The climate is healthful, with cold Winters and brief but very warm Summers. Mean annual rainfall 31 inches. The geological system represented by the State, embraces those rocks included between the primary and the Devonian series, the former containing extensive deposits of copper and iron ore. Besides these minerals, lead and zinc are found in great quantities, together with kaolin, plumbago, gypsum,"], [259, "265 THE NORTHWESTERN STATES. and various clays. Mining, consequently, forms a prominent industry, and one of yearly increasing dimensions. The soil of Wisconsin is of varying quality, but fertile on the whole, and in the north parts of the State heavily timbered. The agricultural yield comprises the cereals, together with flax, hemp, tobacco, pulse, sorgum, and all kinds of vege tables, and of the hardier fruits. In 1870, the State had a total number of 102,904 farms, occupying 11,715,321 acres, of which 5,899,343 con sisted of improved land, and 3,437,442 were timbered. Cash value of farms, $300,414,064 ; of farm implements and machinery, $14,239,364. Total estimated value of all farm products, including betterments and additions to stock, $78,027,032 ; of orchard and dairy stuffs, $1,045,933 ; of lumber, $1,327,618 ; of home manufactures, $338,423 ; of all live-stock, $45,310,882. Number of manufacturing establishments, 7,136, employ ing 39,055 hands, and turning out productions valued at $85,624,906. The political divisions of the State form 61 counties, and the chief places of wealth, trade, and population, are Madison (the capital), Milwaukee, Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, Prairie du Chien, Janesville, Portage City, Racine, Kenosha, and La Crosse. In 1870, the total assessed valuation. reached $333,209,838, as against a true valuation of both real and personal estate aggregating $602,207,329. Treasury receipts during 1870, $886, - 696 ; disbursements, $906,329. Value of church property, $4,749,983. Education is amply provided for. Independently of the State University at Madison, and those of Galesville and of Lawrence at Appleton, and the colleges of Beloit, Racine, and Milton, there are Normal Schools at Platteville and Whitewater. The State is divided into 4,802 common school districts, maintained at a cost, in 1870, of $2,094,160. The chari table institutions of Wisconsin include a Deaf and Dumb Asylum, an Institute for the Education of the Blind, and a Soldiers' Orphans' School. In January, 1870, the railroad system ramified throughout the State totalized 2,779 miles of track, including several lines far advanced toward completion. Immigration is successfully encouraged by the State author ities, the larger number of yearly new-comers being of Scandinavian and German origin. The territory now occupied within the limits of the State of Wisconsin was explored by French missionaries and traders in 1639, and it remained under French jurisdiction until 1703, when it became annexed to the British North American possessions. In 1796, it reverted to the United States, the government of which latter admitted it within the limits of the Northwest Territory, and in 1809, attached it to that of Illinois, and to Michigan in 1818. Wisconsin became independ ently territorially organized in 1836, and became a State of the Union, March 3, 1847.

Its length, north to south, embraces an extent of 380 miles; its oreadth one of 250 miles at a maximum. Area, 84,000 square miles, or 54,760,000 acres. The surface of Minnesota, generally speaking, con sists of a succession of gently undulating plains and prairies, drained by an admirable water-system, and with here and there heavily- timbered bottoms and belts of virgin forest. The soil, corresponding with such a superfices, is exceptionally rich, consisting for the most part of a dark, calcareous sandy drift intermixed with loam. A distinguishing physical feature of this State is its riverine ramifications, expanding in nearly every part of it into almost innumerable lakes \u2014 the whole presenting an aggregate of water-power having hardly a rival in the Union. Besides the Mississippi \u2014 which here has its rise, and drains a basin of 800 miles of country \u2014 the principal streams are the Minnesota (334 miles long), the Red River of the North, the St. Croix, St. Louis, and many others of lesser importance ; the chief lakes are those called Red, Cass, Leech, Mille Lacs, Vermillion, and Winibigosh- Quite a concatenation of sheets of water fringe the frontier line where Minnesota joins British America, culminating in the Lake of the Woods. It has been estimated, that of an area of 1,200,000 acres of surface between the St. Croix and Mis sissippi Rivers, not less than 73,000 acres are of lacustrine formation. In point of minerals, the resources of Minnesota have as yet been very imperfectly developed ; iron, copper, coal, lead \u2014 all these are known to exist in considerable deposits ; together with salt, limestone, and potter's clay. The agricultural outlook of the State is in a high degree satis factory ; wheat constitutes the leading cereal in cultivation, with Indian corn and oats in next order. Fruits and vegetables are grown in great plenty and of excellent quality. The lumber resources of Minnesota are important ; the piue forests in the north region alone occupying an area of some 21,000 square miles, which in 1870 produced a return of scaled logs amounting to 313,116,416 feet. The natural industrial advantages possessed by Minnesota are largely improved upon by a railroad system. The political divisions of this State number 78 counties ; of which the chief cities and towns are : St. Paul (the capital), Stillwater, Red Wing, St. Anthony, Fort Snelling, Minneapolis, and Mankato. Minnesota has already assumed an attitude of high importance as a manufacturing State ; this is mainly due to the wonderful command of water-power she pos sesses, as before spoken of.

Besides a University and Agricultural College, Normal and Reform Schools flourish, and with these may be mentioned such various philanthropic and religious institutions as befit the needs of an intelligent and prosperous community. The finances of the State for the fiscal year terminating December 1, 1870, exhibited a balance on the right side to the amount of $136,164, being a gain of $44,000 over the previous year's figures. The earliest exploration of Minnesota by the whites was made in 1680 by a French Franciscan, Father Hennepin,who gave the name of St. Antony to the Great Falls on the Upper Missisippi. In 1763, the Treaty of Versailles ceded this region to England. Twenty years later, Minnesota formed part of the Northwest Territory transferred to the United States, and became herself territorialized inde pendently in 1849. Indian cessions in 1851 enlarged her boundaries, and, May 11, 1857, Minnesota became a unit of the great American federation of States. Population, 439,706. NEBRASKA. Maximum length, 412 miles ; extreme breadth, 208 miles. Area, 75,905 square miles, or 48,636,800 acres. The surface of this State is almost entirely undulating prairie, and forms part of the west slope of the great central basin of the North American Continent. In its west division, near the base of the Rock}- Mountains, is a sandy belt of country, irregularly defined. In this part, too, are the \" dunes,\" resem bling a wavy sea of sandy billows, as well as the Mauvaises Terres. a tract of singular formation, produced by eccentric disintegrations and denuda tions of the land. The chief rivers are the Missouri, constituting its en tire east line of demarcation ; the Nebraska or Platte, the Niobrara, the Republican Fork of the Kansas, the Elkhorn, and the Loup Fork of the Platte. The soil is very various, but consisting chiefly of rich, bottomy loam, admirably adapted to the raising of heavy crops of cereals. All the vegetables and fruits of the temperate zone are produced in great size and plenty. For grazing purposes Nebraska is a State exceptionally well fitted, a region of not less than 23,000,000 acres being adaptable to this branch of husbandry. It is believed that the, as yet, comparatively infertile tracts of land found in various parts of the State are susceptible of productivity by means of a properly conducted system of irrigation.

The total amount received from the school-fund during the year 1869-70 was $77,999. Education is making great onward strides, the State University and an Agricultural College being far advanced toward completion. In the matter of railroad communication, Nebraska bids fair to soon place herself on a par with her neighbors to the east.

Rapid rules for measuring land without instruments. In measuring land, the first thing to ascertain is the contents of any given plot in square yards ; then, given the number of yards, find out the number of rods and acres. The most ancient and simplest measure of distance is a step. Now, an ordinary-sized man can train himself to cover one yard at a stride, on the average, with sufficient accuracy for ordinary purposes. To make use of this means of measuring distances, it is essential to walk in a straight line ; to do this, fix the eye on two objects in a line straight ahead, one comparatively near, the other remote ; and, in walk ing, keep these objects constantly in line. Farmers and others by adopting the following simple and ingenious con trivance, may always carry with them the scale to construct a correct yard measure. Take a foot rule, and commencing at the base of the little finger ol the left hand, mark the quarters of the foot on the outer borders of the left arm, pricking in the marks with indelible ink.

Rule. \u2014 Multiply the square of one-fifth of the circumference in inches, by twice the length, in feet, and divide by 144. Deduct 1-10 to 1-15 according to the thickness of the bark. Howard s new rule for computing interest. Rule. \u2014 The reciprocal of the rate is the time for which the interest on any sum of money will be shown by simply removing the decimal point two places to the left ; for ten times that time, remove the point one place to the left ; for 1-10 of the same time, remove the point three places to the left. Increase or diminish the results to suit the time given. Note.\u2014 The reciprocal of the rate is found by inverting the rate ; thus 3 per cent, per month, in verted, becomes % of a month, or 10 days. When the rate is expressed by one figure, always write it thus : 3-1, three ones. Rule for converting English into American currency.

No defense can be made against a negotiable instrument (assigned before due) in the hands of the assignee without notice, except fraud was used in obtaining the same. To hold an indorser, due diligence must be used by suit against the maker or his representative. Notes payable to person named or to order, in order to absolutely transfer title, must be indorsed by the payee. Notes payable to bearer may be transferred by delivery, and when so payable, every indorser thereon is held as a guarantor of payment, unless otherwise expressed. In computing interest or discount on negotiable instruments, a month shall be considered a calendar month or twelfth of a year, and for less than a month. a day shall be figured a thirtieth part of a month. Notes only bear interest when so expressed; but after due, they draw the legal interest, even if not stated. INTEREST. The legal rate of interest is six per cent. Parties may agree, in writing, on a rate not exceeding ten per cent. If a rate of interest greater than ten per cent, is contracted for, it works a forfeiture of ten per cent, to the school fund, and only the principal sum can be recovered. DESCENT. The personal property of the deceased (except (1) that necessary for pay ment of debts and expenses of administration ; (2) property set apart to widow, as exempt from execution ; (3) allowance by court, if necessary, of twelve months' support to widow, and to children under fifteen years of age), including life insurance, descends as does real estate. One-third in value (absolutely) of all estates in real property, possessed by husband at any time during marriage, which have not been sold on execution or other judicial sale, and to which the wife has made no relinquishmcnt of her right, shall be set apart as her property, in fee simple, if she survive him."], [286, "294 ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. The same share shall be set apart to the surviving husband of a deceased wife. The widow's share cannot be affected by any will of her husband's, unless she consents, in writing thereto, within six months after notice to her of pro visions of the will. The provisions of the statutes of descent apply alike to surviving husband or surviving wife. Subject to the above, the remaining estate of which the decedent died siezed, shall in absence of other arrangements by will, descend First. To his or her children and their descendants in equal parts ; the descendants of the deceased child or grandchild taking the share of their deceased parents in equal shares among them. Second. Where there is no child, nor descendant of such child, and no widow or surviving husband, then to the parents of the deceased in equal parts ; the surviving parent, if either be dead, taking the whole ; and if there is no parent living, then to the brothers and sisters of the intestate and their descend ants. Third. When there is a widow or surviving husband, and no child or chil dren, or descendants of the same, then one-half of the estate shall descend to such widow or surviving husband, absolutely ; and the other half of the estate shall descend as in other cases where there is no widow or surviving husband, or child or children, or descendants of the same. Fourth. If there is no child, parent, brother or sister, or descendants of either of them, then to wife of intestate, or to her heirs, if dead, according to like rules. Fifth. If any intestate leaves no child, parent, brother or sister, or de scendants of either of them, and no widow or surviving husband, and no child, parent, brother or sister (or descendant of either of them) of such widow or surviving husband, it shall escheat to the State.

A policy of life insurance shall inure to the separate use of the husband or wife and children, entirely independent of his or her creditors. ESTRAYS. An unbroken animal shall not be taken up as an estray between May 1st and November 1st, of each year, unless the same be found within the lawful enclosure of a householder, who alone can take up such animal, unless some other person gives him notice of the fact of such animal coming on his place ; and if he fails, within five days thereafter, to take up such estray, any other householder of the township may take up such estray and proceed with it as if taken on his own premises, provided he shall prove to the Justice of the Peace such notice, and shall make affidavit where such estray was taken up. Any swine, sheep, goat, horse, neat cattle or other animal distrained (for damage done to one's enclosure), when the owner is not known, shall be treated as an estray. Within five days after taking up an estray, notice, containing a full descrip tion thereof, shall be posted up in three of the most public places in the town ship ; and in ten days, the person taking up such estray shall go before a Justice of the Peace in the township and make oath as to where such estray was taken up, and that the marks or brands have not been altered, to his knowledge. rlhe estray shall then be appraised, by order of the Justice, and the appraisement, description of the size, age, color, sex, marks and brands of the estray shall be entered by the Justice in a book kept for that purpose, and he shall, within ten days thereafter, send a certified copy thereof to the County Auditor. When the appraised value of an estray does not exceed five dollars, the Justice need not proceed further than to enter the description of the estray on his book, and if no owner appears within six months, the property shall vest in the finder, if he has complied with the law and paid all costs. Where appraised value of estray exceeds five and is less than ten dollars, if no owner appears in nine months, the finder has the property, if he has com plied with the law and paid costs. An estray, legally taken up, may be used or worked with care and moderation. If any person unlawfully take up an estray, or take up an estray and fail to comply with the law regarding estrays, or use or work it contrary to above, or work it before having it appraised, or keep such estray out of the county more than five days at one time, before acquiring ownership, such offender shall forfeit to the county twenty dollars, and the owner may recover double damages with costs. If the owner of any estray fail to claim and prove his title for one year after the taking up, and the finder shall have complied with the law, a comolete title vests in the finder."], [292, "300 ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. But if the owner appear within eighteen months from the taking up, prove his ownership and pay all costs and expenses, the finder shall pay him the appraised value of such estray, or may, at his option, deliver up the estray. WOLF SCALPS. A bounty of one dollar is paid for wolf scalps. MARKS AND BRANDS. Any person may adopt his own mark or brand for his domestic animals, and have a description thereof recorded by the Township Clerk. No person shall adopt the recorded mark or brand of any other person residing in his township. DAMAGES FROM TRESPASS. When any person's lands are enclosed by a lawful fence, the owner of any domestic animal injuring said lands is liable for the damages, and the damages may be recovered by suit against the owner, or may be made by distraining the animals doing the damage ; and if the party injured elects to recover by action against the owner, no appraisement need be made by the Trustees, as in case of distraint. When trespassing animals are distrained within twenty-four hours, Sunday not included, the party injured shall notify the owner of said animals, if known ; and if the owner fails to satisfy the party within twenty-four hours thereafter, the party shall have the township Trustees assess the damage, and notice shall be posted up in three conspicuous places in the township, that the stock, or part thereof, shall, on the tenth day after posting the notice, between the hours of 1 and 3 P. M., be sold to the highest bidder, to satisfy said damages, with costs. Appeal lies, within twenty days, from the action of the Trustees to the Cir cuit Court. Where stock is restrained, by police regulation or by law, from running at large, any person injured in his improved or cultivated lands by any domestic animal, may, by action against the owner of such animal, or by distraining such animal, recover his damages, whether the lands whereon the injury was done were inclosed by a lawful fence or not. FENCES. A lawful fence is fifty-four inches high, made of rails, wire or boards, with posts not more than ten feet apart where rails are used, and eight feet where boards are used, substantially built and kept in good repair ; or any other fence which, in the opinion of the Fence Viewers, shall be declared a lawful fence \u2014 provided the lower rail, wire or board be not more that twenty nor less than six teen inches from the ground. The respective owners of lands enclosed with fences shall maintain paitition fences between their own and next adjoining enclosure so long as they improve them in equal shares, unless otherwise agreed between them. If any party neglect to maintain such partition fence as he should maintain, the Fence Viewers (the township Trustees), upon complaint of aggrieved party, may, upon due notice to both parties, examine the fence, and. if found insuf-"], [293, "301 ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. ficient, notify the delinquent party, in writing, to repair or re-build the same within such time as they judge reasonable. If the fence be not repaired or rebuilt accordingly, the complainant may do so, and the same being adjudged sufficient by the Fence Viewers, and the value thereof, with their fees, being ascertained and certified under their hands, the complainant may demand of the delinquent the sum so ascertained, and if the same be not paid in one month after demand, may recover it with one per cent a month interest, by action. In case of disputes, the Fence Viewers may decide as to who shall erect or maintain partition fences, and in what time the same shall be done ; and in case any party neglect to maintain or erect such part as may be assigned to him, the aggrieved party may erect and maintain the same, and recover double damages. No person, not wishing his land inclosed, and not using it otherwise than in common, shall be compelled to maintain any partition fence ; but when he uses or incloses his land otherwise than in common, he shall contribute to the parti tion fences. Where parties have had their lands inclosed in common, and one of the owners desires to occupy his separate and apart from the other, and the other refuses to divide the line or build a sufficient fence on the line when divided, the Fence Viewers may divide and assign, and upon neglect of the other to build as ordered by the Viewers, the one may build the other's part and recover as above. And when one incloses land which has lain uninclosed, he must pay for one-half of each partition fence between himself and his neighbors. Where one desires to lay not less than twenty feet of his lands, adjoining his neighbor, out to the public to be used in common, he must give his neighbor six months' notice thereof. Where a fence has been built on the land of another through mistake, the owner may enter upon such premises and remove his fence and material withn six months after the division line has been ascertained. Where the material to build such a fence has been taken from the land on which it was built, then, before it can be removed, the person claiming must first pay for such material to the owner of the land from which it was taken, nor shall such a fence be removed at a time when the removal will throw open or expose the crops of the other party ; a reasonable time must be given beyond the six months to remove crops. MECHANICS' LIENS. Every mechanic, or other person who shall do any labor upon, or furnish any materials, machinery or fixtures for any building, erection or other improve ment upon land, including those engaged in the construction or repair of any work of internal improvement, by virtue of any contract with the owner, his agent, trustee, contractor, or sub-contractor, shall have a lien, on complying with the forms of law, upon the building or other improvement for his labor done or materials furnished. It would take too large a space to detail the manner in which a sub contractor secures his lien. He should file, within thirty days after the last of the labor was performed, or the last of the material shall have been furnished, with the Clerk of the District Court a true account of the amount due him, after allowing all credits, setting forth the time when such material was furnished or labor performed, and when completed, and containing a correct description of"], [294, "302 ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. the property sought to, be charged with the lien, and the whole verified by affidavit. A principal contractor must file such an affidavit within ninety days, as above. Ordinarily, there are so many points to be examined in order to secure a mechanics' lien, that it is much better, unless one is accustomed to managing such liens, to consult at once with an attorney. Remember that the proper time to file the claim is ninety days for a princi pal contractor, thirty days for a sub-contractor, as above ; and that actions to enforce these liens must be commenced within two years, and the rest can much better be done with an attorney. ROADS AND BRIDGES. Persons meeting each other on the public highways, shall give one half of the same by turning to the right. All persons failing to observe this rule shall be liable to pay all damages resulting therefrom, together with a fine, not exceed ing five dollars. The prosecution must be instituted on the complaint of the person wronged. Any person guilty of racing horses, or driving upon the public highway, in a manner likely to endanger the persons or the lives of others, shall, on convic tion, be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars or imprisoned not exceeding thirty days. It is a misdemeanor, without authority from the proper Road Supervisor, to break upon, plow or dig within the boundary lines of any public highway. The money tax levied upon the property in each road district in each town ship (except the general Township Fund, set apart for purchasing tools, machin ery and guide boards), whether collected by the Road Supervisor or County Treasurer, shall be expended for highway purposes in that district, and no part thereof shall be paid out or expended for the benefit of another district. The Road Supervisor of each district, is bound to keep the roads and bridges therein, in as good condition as the funds at his disposal will permit ; to put \"uide boards at cross roads and forks of highways in his district ; and when noti fied in writing that any portion of the public highway, or any bridge is unsafe, must in a reasonable time repair the same, and for this purpose may call out any or all the able bodied men in the district, but not more than two days at one time, without their consent. Also, when notified in writing, of the growth of any Canada thistles upon vacant or non-resident lands or lots, within his district, the owner, lessee or agent thereof being unknown, shall cause the same to be destroyed. Bridges when erected or maintained by the public, are parts of the highway, and must not be less than sixteen feet wide. A penalty is imposed upon any one who rides or drives faster than a walk across any such bridge. The manner of establishing, vacating or altering roads, etc., is so well known to all township officers, that it is sufficient here to say that the first step is by petition, filed in the Auditor's office, addressed in substance as follows : The Board of Supervisors of County : The undersigned asks that a highway, commencing at and running thence and terminating at , be established, vacated or altered (as the case may be.) When the petition is filed, all necessary and succeeding steps will be shown and explained to the petitioners by the Auditor."], [295, "303 ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. ADOPTION OF CHILDREN. Any person competent to make a will can adopt as his own the minor child of another. The consent of both parents, if living and not divorced or separ ated, and if divorced or separated, or if unmarried, the consent of the parent lawfully having the custody of the child ; or if either parent is dead, then the consent of the survivor, or if both parents be dead, or the child have been and remain abandoned by them, then the consent of the Mayor of the city where the child is living, or if not in the city, then of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the county shall be given to such adoption by an instrument in writing, signed by party or parties consenting, and stating the names of the parties, if known, the name of the child, if known, the name of the person adopting such child, and the residence of all, if known, and declaring the name by which the child is thereafter to be called and known, and stating, also, that such child is given to the person adopting, for the purpose of adoption as his own child. The person adopting shall also sign said instrument, and all the parties shall acknowledge the same in the manner that deeds conveying lands shall be acknowledged. The instrument shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder. SURVEYORS AND SURVEYS. There is in every county elected a Surveyor known as County Surveyor, who has power to appoint deputies, for whose official acts he is responsible. It is the duty of the County Surveyor, either by himself or his Duputy, to make all surveys that he may be called upon to make within his county as soon as may be after application is made. The necessary chainmen and other assist ance must be employed by the person requiring the same to be done, and to be by him paid, unless otherwise agreed ; but the chainmen must be disinterested persons and approved by the Surveyor and sworn by him to measure justly and impartially. Previous to any survey, he shall furnish himself with a copy of the field notes of the original survey of the same land, if there be any in the office of the County Auditor, and his survey shall be made in accordance there with. Their fees are three dollars per day. For certified copies of field notes, twenty-five cents. SUPPORT OF POOR. The father, mother and children of any poor person who has applied for aid, and who is unable to maintain himself by work, shall, jointly or severally, maintain such poor person in such manner as may be approved by the Town ship Trustees. In the absence or inability of nearer relatives, the same liability shall extend to the grandparents, if of ability without personal labor, and to the male grand children who are of ability, by personal labor or otherwise. The Township Trustees may, upon the failure of such relatives to maintain a poor person, who has made application for relief, apply to the Circuit Court for an order to compel the same. Upon ten days' notice, in writing, to the parties sought to be charged, a hearing may be had, and an order made for entire or partial support of the poor person."], [296, "304 ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. t\u00bb Appeal may be taken from such judgment as from other judgments of the Circuit Court. When any person, having any estate, abandons either children, wife or hus band, leaving them chargeable, or likely to become chargeable, upon the public for support, upon proof of above fact, an order may be had from the Clerk of the Circuit Court, or Judge, authorizing the Trustees or the Sheriff to take into possession such estate. The Court may direct such personal estate to be sold, to be applied, as well as the rents and profits of the real estate, if any, to the support of children, wife or husband. If the party against whom the order is issued return and support the per son abandoned, or give security for the same, the order shall be discharged, and the property taken returned. The mode of relief for the poor, through the action of the Township Trustees, or the action of the Board of Supervisors, is so well known to every township officer, and the circumstances attending applications for relief are so varied, that it need now only be said that it is the duty of each county to pro vide for its poor, no matter at what place they may be. LANDLORD AND TENANT. A tenant giving notice to quit demised premises at a time named, and after ward holding over, and a tenant or his assignee willfully holding over the prem ises after the term, and after notice to quit, shall pay double rent. Any person in possession of real property, with the assent of the owner, is presumed to be a tenant at will until the contrary is shown. Thirty days' notice, in writing, is necessary to be given by either party before he can terminate a tenancy at will ; but when, in any case, a rent is reserved payable at intervals of less than thirty days, the length of notice need not be greater than such interval betweeu the days of payment. In case of tenants occupying and cultivating farms, the notice must fix the termination of the tenancy to take place on the 1st day of March, except in cases of field tenants or croppers, whose leases shall be held to expire when the crop is har vested ; provided, that in case of a crop of corn, it shall not be later than the 1st day of December, unless otherwise agreed upon. But when an express agreement is made, whether the same has been reduced to writing or not, the tenancy shall cease at the time agreed upon, without notice. But where an express agreement is made, whether reduced to writing or not, the tenancy shall cease at the time agreed upon, without notice. If such tenant cannot be found in the county, the notices above required may be given to any sub-tenant or other person in possession of the premises ; or, if the premises be vacant, by affixing the notice to the principal door of the building or in some conspicuous position on the land, if there be no building. The landlord shall have a lien for his rent upon all the crops grown on the premises, and upon any other personal property of the tenant used on the premises during the term, and not exempt from execution, for the period of one year after a year's rent or the rent of a shorter period claimed falls due ; but such lien shall not continue more than six months after the expiration of the term. The lien may be effected by the commencement of an action, within the period above prescribed, for the rent alone ; and the landlord is entitled to a writ"], [297, "ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. 305 of attachment, upon filing an affidavit that the action is commenced to rcover rent accrued within one year previous thereto upon the premises described in the affidavit.

It is for the interest of the person selling \"short\" to depress the market as much as possible, in order that he may buy and fill his contract at a profit. Hence the \"shorts\" are termed \"bears.\" Buying long, is to contract to purchase a certain amount of grain or shares of stock at a fixed price, deliverable within a stipulated time, expecting to make a profit by the rise in prices.

An agreement is where one party promises to another to do a certain thing in a certain time for a stipulated sum. Good business men always reduce an agreement to writing, which nearly always saves misunderstandings and trouble. No particular form is necessary, but the facts must be clearly and explicitly stated, and there must, to make it valid, be a reasonable consideration. GENERAL FORM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement, made the Second day of June, 1878, between John Jones, of Keokuk, County of Lee, State of Iowa, of the first part, and Thomas Whiteside, of the same place, of the second part \u2014 Witnesseth, that the said John Jones, in consideration of the agreement of the party of the second part, hereinafter contained, contracts and agrees to and with the said Thomas Whiteside, that he will deliver in good and market able condition, at the Village of Melrose, Iowa, during the month of November, of this year, One Hundred Tons of Prairie Hay, in the following lots, and at the following specified times ; namely, twenty-five tons by the seventh of Nov ember, twenty -live tons additional by the fourteenth of the month, twenty-five tons more by the twenty-first, and the entire one hundred tons to be all delivered by the thirtieth of November.

Upon filing for record the certificate, as aforesaid, the persons who shall have signed and acknowledged such certificate, and their associates and success ors, shall, by virtue hereof, be a body politic and corporate by the name stated in such certificate, and by that they and their successors shall and may have succession, and shall be persons capable of suing and being sued, and may have and use a common seal, which they may alter or change at pleasure ; and they and their successors, by their corporate name, shall be capable of taking, receiving, purchasing and holding real and personal estate, and of making by laws for the management of its affairs, not inconsistent with law.

Any person who shall mix any intoxicating liquor with any beer, wine or cider, by him sold, and shall sell or keep for sale, as a beverage, such mixture, shall be punished as for sale of intoxicating liquor. But nothing in the chapter containing the laws governing the sale or pro hibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, shall be construed to forbid the sale by the importer thereof of foreign intoxicating liquor, imported under the author ity of the laws of the United States, regarding the importation of such liquors, and in accordance with such laws ; provided that such liquor, at the time of the sale by the importer, remains in the original casks or packages in which it was by him imported, and in quantities not less than the quantities in which the laws of the United States require such liquors to be imported, and is sold by him in such original casks or packages, and in said quantities only. All payment or compensation for intoxicating liquor sold in violation of the laws of this State, whether such payments or compensation be in money, goods, lands, labor, or any thing else whatsoever, shall be held to have been received in viola tion of law and equity and good conscience, and to have been received upon a valid promise and agreement of the receiver, in consideration of the receipt thereof, to pay on demand, to the person furnishing such consideration, the amount of the money on the just value of the goods or other things. All sales, transfers, conveyances, mortgages, liens, attachments, pledges and securities of every kind, which, either in whole or in part, shall have been made on account of intoxicating liquors sold contrary to law, shall be utterly null and void. Negotiable paper in the hands of holders thereof, in good faith, for valuable consideration, without notice of any illegality in its inception or transfer, how ever, shall not be affected by the above provisions. Neither shall the holder of land or other property who may have taken the same in good faith, without notice of any defect in the title of the person from whom the same was taken, growing out of a violation of the liquor law, be affected by the above provision. Every wife, child, parent, guardian, employer, or other person, who shall be injured in person or property or means of support, by an intoxicated person, or in consequence of the intoxication, has a right of action against any person who shall, by selling intoxicating liquors, cause the intoxication of such person, for all damages actually sustained as well as exemplary damages. For any damages recovered, the personal and real property (except home stead, as now provided) of the person against whom the damages are recovered, as well as the premises or property, personal or real, occupied and used by him, with consent and knowledge of owner, either for manufacturing or selling intox icating liquors contrary to law, shall be liable. The only other exemption, besides the homestead, from this sweeping liability, is that the defendant may have enough for the support of his family for six months, to be determined by the Township Trustee. No ale, wine, beer or other malt or vinous liquors shall be sold within two miles of the corporate limits of any municipal corporation, except at wholesale, for the purpose of shipment to places outside of such corporation and such two mile limits. The power of the corporation to prohibit or license sale of liquors not prohibited by law is extended over the two miles. No ale, wine, beer or other malt or vinous liquors shall be sold on the day on which any election is held under the laws of this State, within two miles of the place where said election is held ; except only that any person holding a permit may sell upon the prescription of a practicing physician."], [311, "ABSTRACT OF IOWA STATE LAWS. 319 SUGGESTIONS TO THOSE PURCHASING BOOKS BY SUBSCRIP- TION. The business of publishing books by subscription, having so often been brought into disrepute by agents making representations and declarations not authorized by the publisher, in order to prevent that as much as possible, and that there may be more general knowledge of the relation such agents bear to their principal, and the law governing such cases,' the following statement is made : A subscription is in the nature of a contract of mutual promises, by which the subscriber agrees to pay a certain sum for the work described; the consid eration is concurrent that the publisher shall publish the book named, and deliver the same, for which the subscriber is to pay the price named. The nature and character of the work is described by the prospectus and sample shoivn. These should be carefully examined before subscribing, as they are the basis and consideration of the promise to pay, and not the too often exag gerated statements of the agent, who is merely employed to solicit subscriptions, for which he is usually paid a commission for each subscriber, and has no authority to change or alter the conditions upon which the subscriptions are authorized to be made by the publisher. Should the agent assume to agree to make the subscription conditional or modify or change the agreement of the publisher, as set out by the prospectus and sample, in order to bind the princi pal, the subscriber should see that such condition or changes are stated over or in connection with his signature, so that the publisher may have notice of the same. All persons making contracts in reference to matters of this kind, or any other business, should remember that the law as ivritten is, that they can not be altered, varied or rescinded verbally, but if done at all, must be done in writing. It is therefore important that all 2}ers\u00b0ns contemplating subscribing should distinctly understand that all talk before or after the subscription is made, is not admissible as evidence, and is no part of the contract. Persons employed to solicit subscriptions are known to the trade as can vassers. They are agents appointed to do a particular business in a prescribed mode, and have no authority to do it any other way to the prejudice of their principal, nor can they bind their principal in any other matter. They can not collect money, or agree that payment may be made in anything else but money. They can not extend the time of payment beyond the time of delivery, nor bind their principal for the payment of expenses incurred in their business. It would save a great deal of trouble, and often serious loss, if persons, before signing their names to any subscription book, or any written instrument, would examine carefully what it is ; if they can not read themselves call on some one disinterested who can."], [312, "STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE OF IOWA (CENSUS OF 1875.)

The universal desire to know the causes of manifest effects, and to ascertain the origin of all things, is as marked to-day as it was in those far-off times when the earth was deemed a flat disc resting upon the back of an elephant, the elephant upon a tortoise, the tortoise upon a serpent, and the serpent upon an undiscovered something. Each age regards its store of knowledge as almost infinite, yet each succeeding generation finds some new fund to draw from and expand the sum of wisdom. Science has opened many pages in the great book of nature, and has supplied the key to the mysteries therein recorded. Future research may modify the theories at first advanced by the patient investigators of the absorbing work ; but so firmly established are many of the ideas promulgated in the school of modern science that they must be ac cepted as fixed facts. In no division of study has greater or more certain progress been made than in that of geology. The finest intellects of the century have been engrossed in the labor of determining the origin of the earth and the gradations by which it has reached its present habitable conditions. As a part of the history of this particular section of the globe, the formation of the rocks and soil, is certainly a topic worthy of considerable space in this record of events. We have, therefore, compiled a geologic sketch of the lower valley of the Des Moines, with the belief that it will be an acceptable paper. In the general history of the State which is given in this volume, will be found a somewhat elaborate description of the geology of Iowa, from a scientific standpoint. It remains for us to limit the circuit of our work in connection herewith to the actual boundaries of the Des Moines Valley. We shall attempt to popularize a most interesting but not generally studied theme, and endeavor to explain, in simple form, what is too often rendered obscure to the uninitiated in scientific methods, by technical terms and expressions. Since those who wish to do so can turn to the general chapter and learn of the geologic structure of the State, let us now bring to a focus the more practical ideas relative to the subject of the recent or superficial formations of this region. This is designed to be only a short popular treatise, so as to interest every man and woman of good observation who shall peruse it, and to call their attention, at least, to the surface formation of the earth, so that in a few years there may be hundreds of observers of interesting geological facts where there is but one at the present time. That geology commends itself to us as a truthful science will be very readily elucidated by a simple statement of a fact within the comprehension of all. To illustrate: A certain kind of rocks are called Arch\u00e6an or Lauren tian. These are the most ancient rocks known to geologists ; at one time they were A"], [316, "324 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. supposed to be destitute of fossils. In all the systems of rocks, they occupy the lowest, and consequently the oldest, position ; but in whatever part of the earth found, they are always recognizable by the geologist. So the Devonian rocks are distinguished by certain fossil fishes that are found in them, and in them alone. The Carboniferous rocks are known by certain fossil mollusks ; the Cretaceous, by certain reptiles that occur in no other formation ; and so every geological period has its characteristic fossils, by means of which the formation and its comparative age may always be accurately determined. The geologist will always know the coal-bearing rocks from any other class ; and this knowledge ought to be possessed by every one interested in explora tions for coal. The geologic history of Iowa is but a page in the general history of the continent of North America. This continent has been demonstrated to be the oldest portion of the earth, notwithstanding the misnomer, \"New World.\" It is new only in civilization. The geologist reads is the rocks evidences of age that are far more reliable than those which are placed on perishable scrolls by the pen of man. The oldest groups of rocks are not found in Iowa, but are visible in the Canadas. The first system, underlying all others, in this State, is the Azoic, seen only in a small section of the northeast portion of Iowa. Next come the Lower and Upper Silurian, the Devonian, the Carboniferous and the Cretaceous systems. Of the earlier formations we shall say nothing, as allusion to them necessitates a far more extended article than we desire to prepare. The scope of this paper extends back only to the Carboniferous system, at the period known as the Subcarboniferous group. In plainer terms, this refers to the limestone which underlies the coal formations, and brings the subject at once to the visible formations in the valley. This section is rich in coal deposits, and a glance at the method of creation will be both interesting and instructive. FORMATION OF LIME BEDS. Limestones have mainly been formed in the bottom of the ocean ; the older and purer kinds in the deep, still sea ; the more recent and less pure in a shal low and disturbed sea. When the great limestone deposits were made in the Mississippi Valley, a deep salt ocean extended from the Alleghany to the Rocky Mountains, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. This was the age of mollusks (shell fish), and the sea bottom swarmed with them. Many of the rocks seem to have been wholly made up of conglomerate shells. In this age of the world there was no creature living with a spinal column or a brain ; but corals, a low order of radiates, as crinoidea, several varieties of mollusks, crustaceans, called trilobites (somewhat corresponding to the river crawfish), and some lowly worms ! These were the highest development of animal life when the earlier limestone rocks were being slowly formed. This Silurian age was succeeded by the Devonian, characterized as the age of fishes, during which were deposited the Hamilton and Carboniferous lime stones. Then came the Subcarboniferous period, during which were deposited the limestone beds. These were formed in a comparatively shallow sea, a fact proven by numerous ripple marks in the rocks, also by their sandy composition in some layers, and farther, by an occasional thin layer of clay intervening between the strata of rocks. These were uneasy times on the earth's crust, when it was given to upheavings and down-sinkings over large areas. Then it was that the whole northeastern and eastern part of the State was up raised."], [317, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 325 THE GREAT COAL BASIN was formed west and south throughout Iowa, reaching into Missouri and Kan sas, and perhaps into the Indian Territory and Texas. Over this vast area there stretched a vast, dismal swamp. On this vast marshy plain grew the rank vegetation that was in the future to be pressed into coal. It was a wilderness of moss and ferns and reeds, such as can be found nowhere on earth at the present time. Prof. Gunning, in speaking of it, says: \" To the land forest of coniferas and cycads, and the marsh forest of scale trees and seal trees and reed trees and fern trees, add an undergrowth of low herbaceous ferns, and you have the picture of a primeval landscape. Blot from the face of nature every flowering weed and flowering tree, every grass, every fruit, every growth useful to man or beast ; go, then to the Sunda Islands for the largest club moss, to the East Indies for the largest tree fern, to the damp glades of Caracas for the tallest reeds, to the Moluccas for their cycad, and to Australia for its pine, to the ponds and sluggish streams of America for their quillwort, and place them all side by side over a vast marsh and its sandy borders, and you will faintly realize your picture of a prim eval landscape. Dwarf the cycad and the pine, lift still higher the tapering column of the tree fern, multiply by two the bulk of the reed and by three the club moss, lift the quillwort from the water, and to its long, linear leaves add a fluted stem eighty feet high, and you would fully realize a carbon iferous landscape \u2014 realize it in all but its vast solitudes. Not a bird ever perched on spiky leaf or spreading fern of a coal forest. No flower had opened yet to spread fragrance on the air, and no throat had warbled a note of music. Such poor animal life as the carboniferous world then possessed left its imprint on wave-washed shore and in the hollow stems of fallen trees.\" This was the beginning of the age of amphibians. Then lived the.progeni tors of the loathsome alligator and lizard. La Conte says : \" The climate of the coal period was characterized by greater warmth, humidity, uniformity and a more highly carbonated condition of the atmosphere than now ob tains.\" We may, therefore, picture to ourselves the climate of this period as warm, moist, uniform, stagnant and stifling from the abundance of carbonic-acid gas. Such conditions were extremely favorable to vegetable life, but not to the higher forms of animal life. Neither man nor monkey nor milk-giving animal of any kind, lived for many cycles of time after the Subcarboniferous period ; but that vegetation grew rank, scientific facts corroborate ; thus, Prof. Gunning says : \" It takes between five and eight feet of vegetable debris to form one foot of coal. A Pittsburgh seam is ten feet thick, while one in Nova Scotia is thirty-five feet in depth. The Pittsburgh seam represents a vegetable deposit of from fifty to a hundred feet in depth, and the one in Nova Scotia between a hundred and seventy-five and three hundred and fifty feet in thickness. A four foot seam in Wapello County would represent from twenty to forty feet of vege table debris. During the growth and decay of this vegetable matter, the surface of the earth did not sink ; but this quiescent period was followed by one of submei gence. \" The surface, loaded with the growth of quiet centuries, was carried down beneath the sea, where it was swept by waves and overspread by sands and mud.\" It was in nature's great hydraulic press, where it remained until another upheaval again threw it to the surface, and another long era of verdure succeeded the one of submergence."], [318, "326 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Thus, emergence and submergence succeeded each other as many times as the coal-seams and the shale, slate or sandstone alternate \u2014 in some parts of Iowa, three times, in Nova Scotia about forty times ! Who can compute the centuries here recorded '. The coal-fields of Iowa are extensive. A line drawn on the map of the State as follows will about define them : Commencing at the southeast corner of Van Buren County, running to the northeast corner of Jefferson, by a wav ing line slightly eastward through Lee and Henry Counties ; thence a few miles northward from Jefferson and northwestward, keeping six or eight miles north of Skunk River, until the southern boundary of Marshall County is reached a little west of the center ; thence three or four miles northeast from Eldora, in Hardin County ; thence westward to a point a little north of Webster City, in Hamilton County, and thence westward to a point a little north of Fort Dodge, in Webster County. The coal-field in Iowa belongs to the true carboniferous system, and is, moreover, the outfield of the vast coal-basin which partly covers this State, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. It is only in the Alleghanies that subterranean action has converted any part of the coal into anthracite. Every where else in the immense basin it is strictly bituminous, varying, however, from the article as first prepared by the economic forces of Nature from the block coal of Indiana to the cannel coal found in certain parts of Iowa. It appears from the researches of Liebig and other eminent chemists, that when wood and other vegetable matter are buried in the earth, exposed to moisture and partially or entirely excluded from air, they decompose slowly and evolve carbonic acid gas, thus parting with a portion of their original oxygen. By this means they become gradually converted into lignite, or wood coal, which contains a larger proportion of hydrogen than wood does. A continuance of decomposition changes this lignite into common or bituminous coal, chiefly by the discharge of carbureted hydrogen, or the gas by which we illuminate our streets and houses. According to Bischoff, the inflammable gases which are always escaping from mineral coal, and are so often the cause of fatal accidents in mines, always contain carbonic acid, carbureted hydrogen, nitrogen and defiant gas. The disengagement of all these gradually transforms ordinary or bituminous coal into anthracite, to which the various names of glance coal, cota, hard coal, culm and many others have been given. In explaining the cause of the freedom of coal from impurities of almost every description, Sir Charles Lyell gives a paragraph which is interesting in this connection. He says: \"The purity of coa! itself, or the absence in it of earthy particles and sand, throughout areas of vast extent, is a fact which appears to be very difficult to explain when we attribute each coal-seam to a vegetable growth in swamps. It has been asked how, during river inundations capable of sweeping away the leaves of ferns and the stems and roots of trees, could the waters fail to transport some fine mud into swamps ? One generation of tall trees after another grew in mud, and their leaves and prostrate trunks formed layers of vegetable matter which afterward covered with mud and turned to shale; but the coal itself, or altered vegetable matter, remained all the while unsoiled with earthy matter. This enigma, however perplexing at first sight, may, I think, be solved by attending to what is now taking place in deltas. The dense growth of reeds and herbage which encompasses the margin of forest covered swamps in the valley and delta of the Mississippi, is such that the fluviatile waters, in passing through them, are filtered and made to clear them selves entirely before they reach the areas in which vegetable matter may accu-"], [319, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 327 mulate for centuries, forming coal, if the climate be favorable. There is no possibility of the least intermixture of earthy matter in such cases. Thus, in the large submerged track called 'Sunk Country,' near New Madrid, forming part of the western side of the valley of the Mississippi, erect trees have been standing ever since the year 1811-12, killed by the great earthquake of that date ; lacustrine and swamp plants have been growing there in the shallows, and several rivers have annually inundated the whole space, and yet have been unable to carry in any sediment within the outer boundaries of the morass, so dense is the marginal belt of reeds and brushwood. It may be affirmed that generally, in the cypress swamps of the Mississippi, no sediment mingles with the vegetable matter accumulated there from the decay of trees and semi aquatic plants. As a singular proof of this fact, I may mention that whenever any part of the swamps in Louisiana is dried up, during an unusually hot season, and the wood is set on fire, pits are burned into the ground many feet deep, or as far down as the fire can descend without meeting with water, and it is then found that scarcely any residuum or earthy matter is left. At the bottom of these cypress swamps a bed of clay is found, with roots of the tall cypress, just as the under clays of the coal are filled with stigmaria.\" CRETACEOUS. The next formation above the coal was the cretaceous, or chalk. This formation is not seen in this region, being encountered only in the west and northwest portions of the State. If any ever existed here, it was carried away during the glacial period, which is hereafter explained. The absence of chalk brings us to speak next of the GLACIAL PERIOD. That the surface of Iowa, and, in fact, the whole of North America north of the thirty-eighth parallel, is covered by a material known as drift, has become a popular opinion. Strewed all over the country, on the hills and in the valleys and on the level prairies, covering up the native rocks to a depth of from twenty to three hundred feet, is found this peculiar deposit. The well-diggers ajid the colliers, in their excavations, encounter it, and the quarryman has to strip it from the surface of this rock bed. It is not all alike ; first there are a few feet of sur face soil, created by recent vegetable deposits ; then a variable depth of clay, or clay and sand intimately blended ; then water-worn gravel and sand, and then blue clay, resting upon the country rock. Scattered over the continent are frequently seen \" lost rocks,\" or bowlders, of various sizes and of different varieties, some of granite, others of gneiss or trap, and occasionally some of limestone. These bowlders are also frequently found in excavating the earth. The blue clay which lies upon the country rocks, or the original formation, is the oldest of the drift deposits. It consists of a heterogeneous mixture of dark blue clay, sand, gravel, pebbles and irregular-shaped stones and bowlders, of various kinds and sizes, unassorted and unstratified, and therefore could not have been deposited in water. Sometimes an occasional piece of stone-coal and fragments of wood are found in it. This blue clay is bowlder or glacier clay. From whence it came and how formed is one of the most interesting subjects that scientific minds have investigated. The history of glacial phenomena is the history of the deposition of the blue clay formation. Too much credit cannot be given to the late lamented Prof. Agassiz and Principal Forbes for their discovery of the laws regulating glacial action. These"], [320, "328 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. eminent savants built a hut on a living glacier, in Switzerland, and studied it in all its relations to the past history of the globe. Prof. Gunning says : \" The area of Greenland is nearly eight hundred thousand square miles ; and all this, save the narrow strip which faces an ice choked sea, on the west, is a lifeless solitude of snow and ice. The snow over tops the hills and levels up all the valleys, so that, as far as the eye can reach, there is nothing but one vast, dreary, level expanse of white. Over all broods the silence of death. Life, there is none. Motion, there seems to be none \u2014 none save of the wind, which sweeps now and then, in the wrath of a polar storm, from the sea over the ' ice-sea,' and rolls its cap of snow into great bil lows, and dashes it up into clouds of spray. But motion there is ; activities we shall see there are, on a scale of grandeur commensurate with the vast desola tion itself.\" Let the mind go back in the history of our earth, one hundred thousand years, when, Prof. Croll, from mathematical deductions, infers the existence of a snow cap, covering the whole of North America and Europe, from the thirty-eighth parallel to the north pole ; then, in imagination, see the larger portion of North America, as you see Greenland now, covered with an \" ice mantle \" 3,000 to 6,000 feet thick. A glacier is a frozen river, having motion as a stream of water has, but bound in gigantic bands by the cold atmosphere. Conceive, if you please, a moving block of iron, thousands of tons in weight, dragged over a plowed field. The track of this monster is marked by a level bed of compressed, pulverized earth. Transfer your imagination to a mass of ice covering the entire northern hemisphere, or at least to the thirty-eighth parallel (at which point the equatorial heat began to assert itself on the ice walls, and decompose them, carrying the debris of the glacier, in solution, southward), moving half a foot or more a day, because of the hydraulic pressure from behind and within \u2014 the streams which flowed into it \u2014 and you can then have some faint idea of the incalculable force of a glacier, and the action of the ice-mass on the plastic earth. The dynamic power of such a continental mass of ice is inconceivable. It is fit to be called one of the giant mills of the gods, which are represented \" to grind slowly, but exceeding fine.\" It was a monstrous ice-plane, shaving off the rugged crags of mountains, leveling up valleys and filling up ancient river beds. Its under surface was thickly set with rock-bowlders, which, with its ponderous weight, ground the underlying rocks to powder. This pulverized rock was washed from beneath the glacier by the overflowing waters which con stantly gushed forth, and settled on far-off plains as alluvial sand and clay. The motion of the glacier was slow, perhaps six inches in twenty-four hours. This was the giant mill that ground out the blue clay \u2014 the glacier clay \u2014 that overlies the native formations of the entire country. It doubtless owes its dark blue color to the Laurentian and trap rocks of Canada. Well-diggers are familiar with it and it is nearly always the same in color and composition. Geologists are now unanimous in the opinion that during the glacial epoch the whole northern portion of the continent was elevated one thousand to two thousand feet above the present level. Le Conte says : \" The polar ice-cap had advanced southward to 40\u00b0 latitude, with still further southward projections, favored by local conditions, and an Arctic rigor of climate prevailed over the United States, even to the shores of the Gulf. At the end of this epoch an opposite or downward movement of land surface over the same region commenced and continued until a depression of five hundred or one thousand feet below the present level was attained."], [321, "329 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Le Conte says : \" This ice sheet moved, with slow, glacier motion, south eastward, southward and southwestward, over New England, New York, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, etc., regardless of smaller valleys, glaciating the whole surface, and gouging out lakes in its course. Northward, the ice-sheet probably extended to the pole ; it was an extension of the polar ice-cap.\" It is not within the province of this sketch to go into details and give the problematic causes of this glacier period. The causes were mainly astronomical. Mr. Croll has calculated the form of the earth's orbit a million years back and a million years forward. The probable time of the last glacial period was 100,000 years back ; then the eccentricity of the earth's orbit was very great, and the earth in aphelion (or when most distant from the sun, being about thirteen millions of miles further than in summer) in midwinter ; then the winters were about thirty days longer than now. In summer, the earth would be correspondingly nearer the sun, and would receive an excess of heat, thus giving the earth in the northern hemisphere short, hot summers and long, cold winters. The subsidence referred to above forms the beginning of THE DRIFT PERIOD. Now let us see how the drift was deposited on the bowlder clay. When the continental depression took place, a large portion of the Mississippi Valley was submerged. Le Conte says: \" It was a time of inland seas. * \u25a0 * Another result, or at least a concomitant, was a moderation of the climate, a melting of the glaciers, and a retreat of the margin of the ice-cap northward. If was, therefore, a time of flooded lakes and rivers. Lastly, over these inland seas and great lakes, loosened masses of ice floated in the form of icebergs. It was, therefore, a time of iceberg action.\" For a time the ideas upon the subject of glacial and iceberg action were confused, until Prof. Agassiz practically demonstrated the difference, on the glacier in Switzerland. The iceberg period followed that of the glacier. The depression of the continent, from 1,000 to 2.000 feet, created a sea-bed. This was filled by the melting of the glacier. Meanwhile, the water supply on the glacier continued, but the moderated climate prevented the formation of the ice cap. As a result, the hydraulic pressure from behind forced the glacier, or frozen stream, into the sea. The buoyancy of the water counteracted on the specific gravity of the glacier, and, when the ice had projected beyond a point at which it could resist the upward pressure of the sea-water, great masses of it were broken off. These masses floated away, and are known as icebergs. The glacier was frozen to the bottom of its river-bed, congealing in its embrace rocks, gravel, sand and whatever substances lay thereon. These sub stances were held firmly during the progress of the iceberg, after its liberation from the parent glacier, until it had floated into warmer waters. Then began a gradual dripping of the freight of the berg, until finally the ice itself disap peared in the mild waters of a tropic ocean. The opinion prevails among geologists that the glacier motion was from the east of north, but that the Champlain flow was from the northwest. Corrobo rating this hypothesis is the marked difference in color of the bowlder clay and the Upper Drift deposit. If the glacier motion was from the north, or east of north, it did not produce the beds of our present rivers. Glaciation, or the process of leveling the earth's surface by the pressure of moving glaciers, only wore off and smoothed down the surface of the country, leaving it a vast undu-"], [322, "330 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. lating plain of dark blue mud, a heterogeneous mass of clay, sand, gravel and bowlders. The old river courses and valleys were completely obliterated. That the great beds of alluvium which cover up the blue clay were deposited in water, is clearly proven by its stratification, which can be observed in almost any excavation where a hill or bluff has been cut through in constructing rail roads or mills, or where brick clay has been procured. But let us see how the Champlain or Drift period was produced. A continental subsidence came on and large inland lakes were formed. The climate became modified ; the glaciers melted more rapidly ; vast icebergs broke loose from the mountain-like glaciers and floated over the land, carrying rocks and clay and debris with them, and as they melted, strewed them over the sur face, sometimes grounding and excavating basins for future lakes and ponds. Thus, year after year and age after age, did the muddy waters and freighted ice bergs flow over the country, the former depositing our present alluvial drift, the latter dropping here and there the bowlders and debris that we now find scat tered over the country. No erosion or wearing away, save from a stranded ice berg, occurred at that time, but it was a period of filling in, a period of dis tribution over the submerged land, of powdered rocks, sand and clay, and an occasional bowlder. But when the continent emerged from the abyss, and the waters flowed off, and the higher undulations of the land appeared, then the erosive action of winds and waves and storms and currents took place. The waters, as they flowed toward the sea and Gulf, produced their inevitable channels. There was much of the drift carried into the streams and borne away in the floods to the sea. Then was the stranded bowlder, by wind and wave, stripped of its soft, alluvial bed, left high and dry on the surface of the hereafter prairie. Then were the gravelly knolls that are found in some parts of the State robbed of every fine sediment, and the gravel and stones left to tell the story of the floods. Then were the great valleys washed out ; then did the annual wash outs all along the water-courses \u2014 rapidly at first, but more slowly in after ages \u2014 eat away the drift accumulations and form the hills. The hilly districts generally lie contiguous to' the streams. Back from these water courses the land is usually undulating prairie, showing but little erosion. The country contiguous to the Des Moines River and its tributaries bears, in many localities, unmistakable evidences of the action of the retiring waters of the Champlain period. As geology has written its history in the rocks, so the latest action of the waters has left its legible records in the drifts \u2014 it made tracks, and by its tracks we can see where it was and what it did. When two currents of water flow together, charged with sediment, where the currents meet there will occur an eddy, the eddy -water will throw down its load of floating mud and build up a bar. In the valley of every creek in this locality, may be found many of those silted-up banks and promontories, the deposits of the waters during the later Champlain period. If our readers will but notice the action of any swollen creek, they will at once perceive how the prairie streams have silted or thrown up the hillocks so frequently met with. Notice the little brook that meets the larger creek yon der. At the mouth of the brook is & firmer bit of ground in the slough, upon which the horseman, at an early day, safely crossed the miry ford. That firm ground was formed by the heavy sediment of the brook. The two streams pro duced an eddy on meeting, and the waters were delayed an instant. Some of the sand brought down stream sank during this pause, and a hillock in embryo was made."], [323, "331 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Years from this time, the course of that stream will be changed because of an impeding elevation of land, and that elevated land will be cultivated, with rich returns. So the surface of the prairies was formed into irregular hills and dales. BOWLDERS are frequently found scattered over the surface of the country, and very com monly in ravines or sloughs, because, when denudation was taking place by the agency of the' subsiding waters, they invariably moved down hill when the earth was washed from under them. This readily accounts for their being usually found in ravines. ORIGIN OF THE PRAIRIES. Prof. Hall, in his Geological Report of Iowa, says : The subject of the origin of the prairies, or the cause of the absence of trees over so exten sive a region, is one which has often been discussed, and in regard to which diametrically opposite opinions are entertained. The idea is very extensively entertained throughout the West, that the prairies were once covered with timber; but that it has been deen destroyed by the fires which the Indians have been in the habit of starting in the dry grass, and which swept a vast extent of surface every Autumn. A few considerations will show that the theory is entirely untenable. In the first place, the prairies have been in existence at least as far back as we have any knowledge of the country, since the first explorers of the West describe them just as they now are. There may be limited areas once covered with woods and now bare ; but, in general, the prairie region occupies the same surface which it did when first visited by the white man. . But, again, prairies are limited to a peculiar region \u2014 one marked by certain characteristic topographical and geological features, and they are, by no means, distributed around wherever the Indians have roamed and used fire. Had frequent occurrence of fires in the woods been the means of removing the timber and covering the soil with a dense growth of grass, there is no reason why prairies should not exist in the Eastern and Middle States, as well as in the Western. The whole northern portion of the United States was once inhabited by tribes differing but little from each other in their manner of living. Again, were the prairies formerly covered by forest trees, we should probably now find some remains of them buried beneath the soil, or other indications of their having existed. Such is not the case, for the occurrence of fragments of wood beneath the prairie surface is quite rare. And when they are found, it is in such position as to show that they had been removed to some distance from the place of their growth. It has been maintained by some that the want of sufficient moisture in the air or soil was the cause of the absence of forests in the Northwest ; and it is indeed true that the prairie region does continue westward, and become merged in the arid plains which extend along the base of the Rocky Mountains, where the extreme dryness is undoubtedly the principal obstacle to the growth of anything but a few shrubs peculiarly adapted to the conditions of climate and soil which prevail in that region. This, however, cannot be the case in the region of the Mississippi and near Lake Michigan, where the prairies occupy so large a surface, since the results of meteorological observations show no lack of moisture in that district, the annual precipitation being fully equal to what it is in the well-wooded country farther east in the same latitude. Besides, the growth of sorest trees is rich and abundant all through the prairie region under certain conditions of soil and position, showing that their range is not limited by any general climatological cause. Taking into consideration all the circumstances under which the peculiar vegetation of the prairie occurs, we are disposed to consider the nature of the soil as the prime cause of the absence of forests, and the predominance of grasses over the widely-extended region. And although chemical composition may not be without influence in bringing about this result, which is a subject for further investigation, and one worthy of careful examination, yet we conceive that the extreme fineness of the particles of which the prairie soil is composed is probably the principal reason why it is better adapted to the growth of its peculiar vege ation than to the development of forests. It cannot fail to strike the careful observer that where the prairies occupy the surface, the soil and superficial material have been so finely comminuted as to be almost in a state of an impalpable powder. This is due, partially, to the peculiar nature of the underlying rocks and the facility with which they undergo complete decomposition, Nand partly to the mechanical causes which have acted during and since the accumulation of the sedimentary matter from the prairie soil."], [324, "332 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. If we go to the thickly-wooded regions, like those of the northern peninsula of Michigan, and examine those portions of the surface which have not been invaded by the forest, we shall observe that the beds of ancient lakes which have been filled up by the slowest possible aecurau' lation of detrital matter and are now perfectly dry, remain as natural prairies and are not trespassed upon by the surrounding woods. We can conceive of no other reason for this than the extreme fineness of the soil which occupies these basins, and which is the natural result of the slow and quiet mode in which they have been filled up. The sides of these depressions, which were lakes, slope very gradually upward, and being covered with a thick growth of vege tation, the material brought into them must have been thus caused. Consequently, when the former lake has become entirely filled up and raised above the level of overflow, we find it cov ered with a most luxuriant crop of grass, forming the natural meadows from which the first settlers are supplied with their first stock of fodder. Applying these facts to the case of the prairies of larger dimensions farther south, we infer, on what seems to be reasonable grounds, lhat the whole region now occupied by the prairies of the Northwest was once an immense lake, in whose basin sediment of almost impalpable fineness gradually accumulated ; that this basin was drained by the elevation of the whole region but, at first, so slowly that the finer particles of the deposit were not washed away, but allowed to remain where they were originally deposited. After the more elevated portions of the former basin had been laid bare, the drainage becoming concentrated into comparatively narrow channels, the current thus produced, aided, perhaps, by a more rapid rise of the region, acquired sufficient velocity lo wear down through the finer material on the surface, wash away a portion of it altogether, and mix the rest so effectually with the underlying drift materials, or with abraded fragments of the rocks in places as to give rise to a different character of soil in the valleys from that of the elevated land. The valley soil being much less homogeneous in composition and containing a larger proportion of course materials than that of the uplands, seems to have been adapted to the growth of forest vegetation ; and in consequence of this we find such localities covered with an abundant growth of timber. Wherever there has been a variation from the usual conditions of soil, on the prairie or in the river bottom, there is a corresponding change in the character of the vegetation. Thus on the prairie we sometimes meet with ridges of coarse material, apparently deposits of drift, on which, from some local cause, there never has been an accumulation of fine sediment. In such localities we invariably find a growth of timber. This is the origin of the groves scattered over the prairies, for whose isolated position and peculiar circumstances of growth we are unable to account in any other way. The condition of things in the river valleys themselves seems to add to the plausibility of this theory. In the district which we have more particularly examined, we have found that where rivers have worn deep and comparatively narrow valleys, bordered by precipitous bluffs, there is almost always a growth of forest; but where the valley widens out, the bluffs become less conspicuous, indicating a less rapid erosion and currents of diminished strength ; there decomposition takes place under circumstances favorable to the accumulation of prairie soil, and the result has been the formation of the bottom prairie, which becomes so important a feature of the valleys of the Mississippi and Missouri below the limits of Iowa. Where these bottom prairies have become, by any change in the course of the river currents, covered with coarser materials, a growth of forest trees may be observed springing up, and indicating by their rapid development a congenial soil. This theory is noticeably substantiated by the formation and condition of the valley of the lower Des Moines. DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY. Van Buren County is bounded on the east by Lee and Henry Counties, on the north by Jefferson County, on the west by Davis County, and on the south by the Missouri line. It embraces a fraction over thirteen townships, or about four hundred and eighty square miles of surface, and is one of the best timbered counties in this part of the State. The Des Moines River runs diagonally through the county from northwest to southeast, affording a considerable belt of timber and an abundant supply of stock-water in ordinary seasons. The country lying north of the river is marked with Crooked, Lick, Coates, Reed and Cedar Creeks, each skirted with timber from their source to their outlet. The prairies are generally small, with a rolling surface and a soil fully equal to the average prairie soil of the West. The upland timber consists of black and white oak, hickory, elm, linden and cherry, while upon the Des Moines"], [325, "333 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 5> bottom maybe found black and white walnut, sugar and white maple, ash, hack berry, cottonwood, sycamore, honey-locust and mulberry. At least three-fourths of the superficial area of this county is underlaid by deposist belonging to the coal formation, but it is not probable that a workable coal-seam will be found to extend over more than one-half or two-thirds of the territory so underlaid. At least two workable coal-seams outcrop in the county, varying in thick ness from two to five feet. The upper one is exposed in the vicinity of Iowa ville, on the south side of the Des Moines, and at Business Corners and vicin ity, on the north side of the river. The lower seam, where it occurs of suffi cient thickness to afford a profitable bed, seems to have been deposited in basins or depressions in the limestone. The coal at Farmington, both at Williams and Johnson's bank, occurs in a basin of this kind, and is about two miles in width from east to west, and extends south a half mile beyond the Des Moines River, varies from two to three feet in thickness. On the prairies, good wells of living waters are obtained from twenty to thirty feet below the surface. But along the river-bluffs and on the timbered lands generally, considerable difficulty is experienced in procuring good water, and cisterns are in general use. Quarries of the best building material abound in the bluffs of almost every stream. On Chequest Creek is a fine-grained, compact limestone of a light gray or dove color, and susceptible of a fine polish. The rock seems well adapted to many purposes for which an ornamental stone is required, and has acquired some reputation as Chequest marble. Tin, copper and iron have been discov ered, and, excepting the mineral productions of Dubuque and Jackson Coun ties, Van Buren County contains more variety in its geological features than any other in the State. For beauty of scenery, extent of cultivation and fertility of soil, the county stands unrivaled. So much for generalizing. Now for a more definite dwelling upon the min eral products. The full thickness of the coal-bearing strata in this county is not accurately known. Some of the oldest mines in the State are located here. The strata, however, probably nowhere exceeds one hundred and fifty feet, and is known to be usually much less. The number of different beds of coal has not been fully made out, but there are probably three, only one of which is usually of suffi cient thickness for purposes of working. This bed, if it be always the same one in which the mines are opened, is of very considerable importance and from it large quantities of coal have been, and very much more may yet be obtained. A mine has for a long time been opened in a three-and-one-half-foot bed of coal, a little below the town of Independent, in the extreme northwest corner of the county. About two and a half miles eastward from the same town, a mine has been opened in a four-foot bed. About half a mile up the same creek valley in which the latter is located, another opening has been made in a four-foot bed, which appears to be a separate bed from the others, being quite above it. Half a mile south of Burnes' Corners, is one of the oldest mines in the county, situated in a half-foot bed. A little south of this, near Doud's Station, some mines were formerly successfully operated and they may, doubtless, be re-opened. At and in the vicinity of Keosauqua, several openings have been made in a bed of coal about three feet thick, which have for many years been worked to supply local demand. A three-foot bed of coal has also been opened in the same township."], [326, "334 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. At Farmington, large quantities of coal were formerly mined. These mines were successfully worked. In the northeastern corner of the county some mines have been profitably worked for many years, to supply a local demand. There have been also other openings made in coal-beds in this county. The clay associated with the coal-bearing strata of this county has been extensively used at Vernon for the manufacture of stone pottery. An artesian well 705 feet deep has been bored at Farmington, and a full flow of water was the result. The water, as analyzed by Prof. Emery, is proved to contain, per liter, 1.12 grains of ferruginous sediment, and 8.18 grains of solid matter in solution, making a total of 9.3 grains of solid matter per liter. Its principal constituent is ferric sulphate. It also contains considerable gyp sum, sodium and hydrochloric acid. A portion of the sulphuric acid is free ; the amount, per liter, contained in the water being 3.306 grains. The matter also contains 1.58 grains of ferric oxide and 0.403 grains of calcium oxide, per liter. The following is a list of timber found within the county : White-maple, sugar-maple, buckeye, water-birch, hickory, pignut-hickory, pecan, hackberry, black wild-cherry, white-ash, honey-locust, Kentucky coffee-bean, butternut, white-walnut, black-walnut, box-elder, button, sycamore, cotton-wood, aspen, white-oak, burr-oak, black- oak, linden bass-wood, common elm and slippery elm. THE UNKNOWN RACE. The cession of the lands once owned by the Indians, opened up this region to the whites, and brought, the county of Van Buren within the limits of settle ment. In 1836, the last traces of resistance to a superior power disappeared from the Indian bands, and impetus was given to progression. Piece by piece the lands of Iowa had been wrested from the aborigines, until a t last there remained but one step between them and utter rout. The time was fast approach ing when the voice of authority should cry \"depart,\" and the vanguard of the pale-faced invaders on the hunting-grounds and homes of the natives was fret ting in the invisible chain which held it back. The legends of this fated people are rich with unwritten poetry and romance. The spectacle of fallen greatness is sad in any case, and invests the victims of adverse fate with a halo, perhaps inconsistent with reality, but nevertheless worthy of a passing thought. But, before we reach the era of Indian occupancy, there is encountered that which gives pause to the prosecution of research in that direction, and opens up a fruitful field for speculation. The history of Van Buren County is so much older than the period embraced even by Indian legends, that we stand in grave silence before the evidences of those who have gone before. The red man alone is not the only denizen of these groves, these hills and vales. Long before the war-whoop of the Indian awoke echoes in the silent watches of the night, or the plaintive song of Indian lover aroused the dusky maiden to the thought of love, there lived a race of men with passions, ambitions and desires perhaps akin to those we know. The march of time destroyed these primitive dwellers of the earth, leaving but vague traces of their existence for us to ponder over. A broken flint, an arrow-head, a bit of crudest pottery \u2014 what are these ? Traces of a lost people, of whom even legends have become extinct for ever. Such sights as these suggest the thought that Nature but reproduces her grand est works in eras marked by \u00e6ons of ages."], [327, "335 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Those who struck the first blows, in the name of Improvement, upon the banks of the Des Moines, have beheld a ruined nation depart, never to return. May it not be that our race, too, must some day stand before a super ior power, and watch its noblest efforts grow pale before the light of other minds? In the womb of centuries may there not be those who will repeople what are to become the vast solitudes of these broad acres, now so busy with teeming millions, and read with curious eyes the evidences of ourselves \u2014 a forgotten race ? Perhaps beneath the sea there slumbers now a continent that will some day grow rank with life, and send forth pioneers to seek new worlds. The record of the rocks tells us that these things have been; and what was once performed may be again accomplished. The mold of centuries may rise above our streets. The wash of waves may erode our noblest monuments. Ruin and decay give birth to youth and grandeur. A language strange to ears in being now, may portray the marvels of a land in which primeval forests thrive ; where stores of virgin wealth lie deep within the bowels of the earth ; where fertile plains wave with luxuriant vegetation; where the ax was never heard, and where the ground was never trodden by human foot. Then will the husbandman's imple ment reveal the broken columns which centuries have concealed beneath their accumulation of waste, and the arch\u00e6ologist wax wise over the fragments of our vaunted might. As these things may be, let us, while now we can, pay to those who have preceded us the passing tribute of a sigh. That these broad lands were once the home of a people now no longer num bered among the living, there can be no doubt. Evidences of their existence are at the very doors of those who dwell in the fertile valley of the Des Moines. The Mound-Builders, as modern tongue is pleased to term them from lack of a better name, have left traces of their presence here which admit of no dispute. Who they were and from whence they came, the wisest arch\u00e6ol ogists are puzzling their brains to determine. The secret of their lives has perished with their mortal frames, leaving naught but food for speculation behind. Some future generation, it is true, may chance upon a hidden tablet or a source of light which will illumine the darkness of the present respecting the prehistoric race. Even here, where such lavish manifestations of their sojourn exist, there may be stored the key to the vast mystery. Some day the truth may be made clear, but now we can only record the facts made patent to us, and hope for the dawn of that eventful morn when the cabalistic signs on table and on rock shall become like opened books before our eyes. Among the numerous gentlemen resident in Ottumwa, or in the Des Moines Valley, who have given intelligent thought to the investigation of this absorbing topic, we first name Mr. Samuel B. Evans, of the Ottumwa Democrat, as an authority upon the subject of the local mounds. Mr. Evans has acquired a reputation as a patient worker in this broad field, and has prepared many arti cles for the press, pertaining to the mounds in Wapello and Van Buren Coun ties. A paper was requested of him by the Smithsonian Institution, elaborat ing the location and character of the ancient works in this section of the State, and, through the kindness of Mr. Evans, we are permitted to illustrate this brief chapter with copies of diagrams prepared by him for the paper referred to. These outline cuts will convey to the reader a better idea of the position"], [328, "336 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. of the mounds, and, what is even more important, they will preserve a record of their topography in the event of their destruction by the rapid encroach- ments of modern improvements.

W. H. Kitterman, S. H. Burton and D. T. Mil ler. The Stiles, by Hon. E. H. Stiles. The Trowell has not been opened, so far as can be ascertained. Village Creek, by Mr. Richard Williams and Mr. A. T. Holly. Keosauqua, or Ely Ford Group (shown here in diagram \"B\"), by Judge Robert Sloan, Mr. J. J. Kinnersly, Mr. D. C. Beaman, Messrs. Robert N. and Charles L. Dahlberg and Ben Johnson, Esq. The names of these gentlemen are ample guaranty of the thoroughness and intelligence of the search made. Capt. Kitterman, Mr. Williams, Mr. Holly and Judge Sloan are especially qualified to prosecute so important an under taking. The Sugar Creek Mounds (Sec. 21, T. 72, R. 13) are simple tumuli. The first one opened stands upon a high elevation, and may be termed a mound of observation. From it, those lying to the southwest, the Trowell Mounds, are visible, although a mile and a half distant. From this post, a series of com munication might be maintained with a person stationed on the Trowell hillock, if the intervening growth of young trees was removed. From this mound, nothing of value was obtained save bits of charcoal and decomposed ashes. This fact goes to confirm the theory that it was designed as a station of survey. The second of the Sugar Creek group contained a few decayed bones, but no estimate of their character was possible. From the Trowell Mound the Stiles tumuli are plainly seen. These mounds lie in the suburbs of Ottumwa. When they were opened, in the spring of 1878, no traces of human burial were found. There were but few, and those unsatisfactory, evidences of cremation. In one of the largest, a small hatchet was obtained, which was made of green stone, highly finished. The character of this hatchet led the explorers to believe that its deposit was accidental. No other implements in entire form were discovered, but several bits of broken arrow-heads and a few chips or cherts of obsidian were taken. This flint is exceedingly rare. If the valley and intervening ridges were denuded of the growing young timber, one group of the Village Creek mounds could be seen from this mound, although the Creek\" groups are more than three miles distant. In the fall of 1877, three of the Village Creek mounds 'were carefully examined. A reference to diagram \"A\" will show that there are two groups, each composed of seven or eight individual mounds, lying in line. The groups are about one mile apart. Those which were opened contained evidences of cremation. Successive layers of ashes and charcoal, intermingled with calcined bones. No implements of any kind were discovered in a complete state, and but few broken arrow-heads. From this record it will be seen that the mounds removed from the river \u2014 the Sugar Creeks \u2014 are in line of direct communication with those on the stream, by means of signals. This fact is mentioned merely as an incidental one, perhaps worthy of consideration. Recent examination of the Caldwell and Hedrick Mounds resulted in nothing important. They contained no remains, human or otherwise, but were doubtless mounds of observation solely. Still, subsequent research may reveal relics, and it is to be hoped that the investiga tion will be carefully made at an early day."], [330, "338 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. DIAGRAM B.

In July, 1878, the Ely Ford Mounds in Van Buren County were opened. The location of these tumuli is as follows : Counting from the left bank of the creek northwestward, No. 1 is 20 rods north, 55\u00b0 west from mouth of creek ; 20 feet above river-bed ; 40 feet from water's edge. There is no timber. In this were found fresh-water muscle-shells in large quantity, and pieces of pottery, arrow-heads, bones (probably animals'), part of a human jaw with teeth, and foot and leg bones of a human skeleton in fair state of preservation. There was a surface deposit of about two feet ever these remains. No. 2 was 10 rods north, 60\u00b0 west from No. 1, on Bluff Point, 100 feet above river-bed, 200 feet from water's edge. On this mound were the decayed remains of a large white-oak tree, which was two feet in diameter ; also young oak growing. In the mound was found A HUMAN SKULL entire, except the lower jaw. A portion of the upper jaw was decomposed, but one tooth remained. The leg-bones were also discovered. The position of the skeleton was two feet beneath the surface, with head southeast, horizontal. The same pottery as in No. 1. The dimensions of this skull are as follows : horizontal circumference, 20 inches ; longitudinal arc, from nasal depression, along middle line of skull to occipital protuberance, 13 inches ; transverse measurement, 5 inches ; vertical height, 3 75-100 inches ; longitudinal meas urement, 8 inches. This skull approaches very nearly to the famous Neander thal, or Cave skull, of Prussia. No. 3 is half-moon shaped, 15 rods north, 550 west from No. 2, on same bluff, 120 feet above the river-bed, and 200 feet from water's edge. In it were found thigh-bones. No. 4 was 15 rods north, 45\u00b0 west from No. 3, but contained nothing valu able, and may be modern. No. 5 was a large mound, 50 feet in diameter and 5 feet in height ; located 30 rods south, 45\u00b0 east from mouth of Ely's Creek, on high bluff point, 100 feet above river-bed, and 20 rods from water's edge. Upon it was a decayed white oak stump, 24 inches in diameter, located 12 feet north, 10\u00b0 west from"], [331, "339 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. the center of the mound, and another stump of similar character 16 inches in diameter, 4 feet north from center. In this mound were discovered human thigh-bones under the south side of the large stump, five feet from the surface, and subsequent investigation revealed TWO SKELETONS in excellent state of preservation. The wood of the oak crumbled in the hand, because of its exceedingly rotten condition. There were fragments of the arm bone, and the position of the body must have been horizontal, with head toward the west and leg doubled under. Quantities of shells were found, as in No 1. Later research revealed the best preserved skull ever found in this country. It is now in the possession of Mr. Evans, of Ottumwa, and is a proper object of elaborate study and comparison. The region about Keosauqua is evidently rich in evidences of ancient sepulture. The river-bank is thickly covered with these mounds. The diagram does not show the twentieth part of the tumuli in Van Buren County. Nearly fifty have been discovered in the immediate vicinity of Keosauqua. We aim to locate only those which have been explored by Mr. Evans, or some one skilled in the detection of relics. Judge Sloan has devoted a considerable portion of the leisure which his arduous professional duties grudgingly gave him to the contemplation of thissubject. From him we learn that he is aware of the existence of some forty-five mounds, be sides many \"pockets,\" or places of deposit in the bluffs, where shells, bits of bone \u2014 probably of animals that served as food \u2014 and fragments of pottery are placed, and slightly covered with earth. The most valuable discovery yet made in the Des Moines Valley is the skull which we have described. It is the remains of a race the like of which does not exist on earth at the present time. The doubts created as to the antiquity of the stone implements found are natural and reasonable. Any race of stone workers might have produced them ; but the irrefutable evidence of the skull silences comment and arouses profound conjecture. The modern Indian pos sesses no characteristics like those which must have been the portion of this man, whose gaping sockets mock us as we gaze into them. Could the tongue which once formed syllables of command beneath that moidering jaw be re-in vested with the power to speak, what tales it could unfold ! The race of which this is a type was easily led, low in intellect, and not far different from the patient toiler on the Pyramids of Egypt. Messrs. Robert N. and Charles L. Dahlberg, explored the region of the mouth of Chequest Creek, at Pittsburg, Van Buren County, with satisfactory results, on the 31st of July, 1878. Ancient pottery was discovered. A descrip tion of the ware, prepared by the gentlemen who unearthed it, is herewith appended : The pieces of pottery found are composed of clay and sand, mixed with small pebbles, form ing a cement which appears to be baked rather than burned. The most of the pieces found show that the heat applied in their construction was not sufficient to melt the sand or pebbles, or in any way to affect their original condition. No glazing appears on the pottery, and yet it is of a hard, firm, durable substance which is impervious to water. One piece of pottery is about four inches square, but of an irregular shape. At one point it is shown to be a part of the top of a wide-mouthed vessel, evidently about two inches less in diameter at the neck than at the top. Judo-ing by the arc described by the piece in question, the neck of the piece must have been at least 18 inches in diameter. This piece also shows attempts at ornamentation, having a horizontal row of dots, or beads, about an inch and a half from the top of the vessel ; these have the appearance of having been made by punctures from the inside of the vessel, and are about half an inch apart, or seven eio-hths from center to center. \u00b0 B"], [332, "340 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. There are also parallel lines running about it horizontally, about half an inch apart, which were evidently made by some blunt instrument about one-eighth of an inch square, pressed into the clay, leaving little ridges between each impression of the instrument that would average about one-sixteenth of an inch thick. There are a number of small pieces, one showing dis tinctly that the neck and rim of the vessel above it were qaite flaring, though this rim does not show entire. The rim is ornamented by diamond-shaped figures made by lines crossing each other, which lines are formed very much like the parallel lines in the larger piece. Another piece shows parallel lines. One small piece is corrugated as the Ely Ford pottery ; and shows distinctly the application of heat sufficient to fuse the silex in the composition of the pottery, making it a very hard and firm substance ; this piece is thinner than the baked pieces. Another piece shows bead- work distinctly about an inch from the top of the vessel ; the body of the vessel is ornamented with parallel lines running at right angles with the top of the vessel, made as in the first piece described, and the top ornamented very much as our mothers used to ornament the edge of a pie. Several other pieces show the application of heat sufficient to fuse the silex in their compo sition. Several, including the larger piece described above, show on the edges and upon both surfaces glittering particles, which appear to be small pieces of isinglass. This pottery was nearly all found upon the surface of the ground, having been washed out by the action of the water; some were found on the creek-bank, and some on the river-bank near the edge of the water, but all at the mouth of Chequest, which empties into the river at Pittsburg. In the river-bank in front of the village is also a bed of ashes and charcoal, about three inches in depth, and about two feet from the surface of the ground. Mr. Evans recently contributed to the Chicago Times a series of letters descriptive of the mounds in this locality, and speculative as to their origin. We quote so much of the contributions as treats of the appearance of the tumuli: The mounds which I have examined on Village Creek presented the following conditions , They are found on natural elevations, the highest in the vicinity. They are regular in shape and regular in the arrangement of the materials which compose them. The second stratum of earth composing them, immediately beneath the natural soil, accumulated by the decay of vege tation, is very often foreign to the surroundings. Then succeed strata of ashes, charcoal and earth, averaging about five inches in thickness. Human remains are found in these mounds, but not always, which indicates that they were not originally made for burial places, and give color to the idea that they were utilized by succeeding populations for uses foreign to the design of the builders. But in Iowa they are not numerous enough to encourage the supposition that they were merely sites of dwelling-places, because of the labor to build them. It is not reason able to believe that any people, whether civilized or barbarous, would build a mound which would require the labor of ten men for fifty days, on the top of which a wooden building could be constructed less than twenty feet in circumference. In Wapello County we have a range of mounds about two miles from the river, on a ridge running parallel with the Des Moines, on the southern side which overlooks the plateau or bot tom land of the stream, and is in plain view of a corresponding range of mounds situated on a high hill north of the river. These mounds are similar in shape, and having examined many of them on each side of the river, I find their interior composition to be very much alike. The layers of ashes, charcoal and earth are the same, and in some of them human remains were found. In a few of them I have discovered flint implements. I must confess, however, that after all my examinations I cannot settle down on any well-grounded opinion as to the objects for which these mounds were created, except to disagree with all the theories so far advanced. The ashes and charcoal and human remains showing the action of fire, have at times induced me to believe that the Mound-Builders practiced cremation, and that after the rites were performed the remains were covered with earth, each succeeding funeral pyre adding to the height of the mound. Yet, while this theory has in my mind more proofs than any other yet advanced, I am not prepared to accept it without additional evidence. Arch\u00e6ologists have determined that the mounds of America may be prop erly classed under three general heads, viz.: Mounds of Observation, Mounds of Sacrifice and Mounds of Burial. The first were doubtless used as posts of communication between distant bands. They are always found on elevated lands, from which wide areas of territory may be seen, if modern timber or edifices do not intervene. From one to another a signal fire or flag might have conveyed intelligence of invasion, of joy or of distress. This class of works is found in Wapello County, in an excellent state of preservation. The larger groups present evidences of having been erected for such purposes, rather than for sacrificial observances, or even for the disposal of the dead ; although"], [333, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 341 some of the tumuli, undoubtedly, were devoted separately to each of the three purposes. In Van Buren County, the dwelling-places of the Mound-Builders are more distinctly marked. While observation hills are found there, also, the larger number of mounds bear striking testimony of other uses. The unearthing of the skeletons from Mounds Nos. 2 and 5, are events worthy of the considera tion of scientists the world over. The fragments of pottery, the stone imple ments and the heaps of shells and animal bones, furnish food for deepest thought. The ground is rich in remains of every character, and should be thoroughly investigated. From far above Pittsburg to a point several miles below Keosauqua, a con tinuous chain of works is to be seen. The diagram of the great bend in the river, near Keosauqua, shows but a faint outline of the place where future arch\u00e6ologists will delve with satisfactory results. It is not within the province of this chapter to enter into an elaborate dis cussion of the subject, but, as has already been intimated, merely to suggest where the labor should be undertaken. Van Buren County should be made the theater of exhaustive research, and if this paper prepares the way for such enterprises, its mission will be fully accomplished. HISTORY OF THE ABORIGINES. From the contemplation of this primordial race \u2014 a people which must be termed the originals, so far as our imperfect knowledge extends, but which may, after all, have been but the last fragments of a nation greater even than our own \u2014 let us pass to the consideration of those tribes which are not mythical. Human improvement, rushing through civilization, crushes in its march all who cannot grapple to its car. This law is as inexorable as Fate. \" You colonize the lands of the savage with the Anglo-Saxon,\" says Stephen Mon tague ; \" you civilize that portion of the earth ; but is the savage civilized ? He is exterminated ! You accumulate machinery, you increase the total of wealth ; but what becomes of the labor you displace ? One generation is sacrificed to the next. You diffuse knowledge, and the world seems to grow brighter ; but Discontent at Poverty replaces Ignorance happy with its crust. Every Im provement, every advancement in civilization, injures some to benefit others, and either cherishes the want of to-day or prepares the revolution of to-mor row.\" It is, as it were, but yesterday since the hills and valleys of the Des Moines re-echoed the mournful dirge of the departing red man. The years are few in number since the sorrowful cortege passed slowly toward the setting sun, leaving behind the noble dead, sleeping in the cold embrace of the grim monarch, by the side of their beloved white father ; leaving the homes they had been taught to claim as their own ; leaving all, even hope, behind. There still live many persons who beheld the strange sight of a remnant of a race departing forever from the scenes of their early life, and such will, doubtless, be disposed to sneer at the pen which finds a source of sadness in the contemplation of this event. But worthy hands have written lines of living power upon the theme, nor can the harsh character of fact denude the subject of a glamour which poetry and romance have cast around the dusky subject and his fate. There is a grandeur in the record of the race which the stern force of truth is powerless to dispel."], [334, "342 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUMTY. Those men who were compelled to meet the groveling band which had sur vived the first shock of defeat, saw only the ruin which the strong had wrought upon the weak. The native power had fled ; a subjugated race was subsisting in its helplessness upon the bounty of its conquerors. There was no spot on earth left for them. Foot by foot their mighty possessions were taken from them, not in the din and whirl of battle, but by the humiliating processes of peace. Here, at last, they stood, with bowed heads, meekly awaiting the decree which should compel them to resume their endless march. Behind them was the tradition of their strength ; before them, annihilation of their clans. Even their warlike instincts were dwarfed in the presence of their masters. Had they disputed titles with the whites, the memories clustering about them now would be far different. But that resort to arms, that defiant struggle to the end, that disappearance in dramatic furor \u2014 all was denied them. Had they been other in nature than they were, this placid surrender to fate would seem less pitiful. Once fierce and bloody, then subdued, their stolid acceptance of destiny carried with it a mournful air that will be breathed through history's pages while our race shall live. The Indian is the embodiment of the dramatic, and when the curtain is rung down upon a scene so spiritless and tame as this of which we write, the admiration which is his due is turned to pity. The actual spectators of the drafna find it impossible to forget the sordid character of the players, it is true; but at even so short a remove of time as this which has already elapsed since this county was the theater of the play, a shade of romance is imparted and the events become absorbing in their interest. KEOKUK, THE ORATOR CHIEFTAIN. The soil of Van Buren County has been trodden by two of the greatest red men of recent times. Keokuk, the Chief, and Black Hawk, the Brave, both found thereon a resting-place, while within the limits of the region were enacted many of the most important scenes of their eventful lives. Keokuk, the grand sachem, was a man of tall, commanding presence, straight as an arrow, and, when aroused, could make an eloquent speech to his tribe. He was selected by the United States Government to distribute the annuities to the Sacs and Foxes \u2014 not only for his energies when opposed to the nation in battle, but for his influence among the red men everywhere. But he was avaricious and intemperate, putting any amount of whisky under his royal toga, and stealing from his red brothers the hard silver so kindly given them by the Great Father at Washington. He had a chronic quarrel with Hardfish's band, that lived in Kishkekosh, near Eddyville, and receiving a severe wound from one of this tribe, he died soon after reaching Kansas, in 1845. From a sketch of Keokuk, published in the \"Annals of Iowa,\" 1865, by Uriah Biggs, one of the pioneers of Van Buren, the following interesting extracts are made : \" Keokuk is deserving of a prominent page in the history of the country, and a truthful history of his life would be read and cherished as a memento of one of nature's noblemen. As an orator, he was entitled to rank with the most gifted of his race. In person, he was tall and of portly bearing, and in his public speeches he displayed a commanding attitude and graceful gestures. He spoke rapidly, but his enunciation was clear and distinct and very forcible, culling his figures from the stores of nature, and basing his arguments in skill ful logic. He maintained in good faith the stipulations of treaties with the United States and with the neighboring tribes. He loved peace and the social"], [335, "343 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. amenities of life, and was fond of displaying those agreeable traits of character in ceremonious visits to neighboring chiefs, in which he observed the most punctilious etiquette and dignified decorum. He possessed a ready insight into the motives of others, and was not easily misled by sophistry or beguiled by flattery; and in the field of wit, he was no mean champion. It is not my purpose to write a history of his life, but I will give one anecdote in illustration of these traits of his character. \"While residing near Ottumwah-noc, he received a message from the Mor mon Prophet, Joe Smith, inviting Keokuk, as King of the Sacs and Foxes, to a royal conference at his palace at Nauvoo, on matters of the highest impor tance to their respective people. The invitation was readily accepted, and a train of ponies was soon wending its way to the Mormon city, bearing Keokuk and his suite in stately procession and savage pomp. \" Notice had circulated through the country of this diplomatic interview, and a number of spectators attended to witness the denouement. The audience was given publicly in the Mormon temple, and the respective chiefs were attended by their suites, the Prophet by the dignitaries of the Mormon Church, and the Indian potentate by the high civil and military functionaries of his tribe, and the gentiles were comfortably seated as auditors. \" The prophet opened the conference in a set speech of considerable length, giving Keokuk a brief history of the children of Israel, as detailed in the Bible, and dwelt forcibly upon the story of the lost tribes, and of the direct revelation he had received from a divine source, that the North American Indians were these identical lost tribes, and that he, the prophet of God, held a divine commission to gather them together and to lead them to a land ' flowing with milk and honey.' After the prophet closed this harangue, Keokuk 'waited for the words of his pale-faced brother to sink deep into his mind,' and, in making his reply, assumed the gravest attitude and most dignified demeanor. He would not controvert anything his brother had said about the lost and scattered condition of his race and people, and if his brother was commissioned by the Great Spirit to collect them together and lead them to a new country, it was his duty to do so. But he wished to inquire about some particulars his brother had not named, that were of the highest importance to him and his people. The red men were not much used to milk, and he thought they would prefer streams of water, and in the country where they now were there was a good supply of honey. The points that they wished to inquire into were whether the new government would pay large annuities, and whether there was plenty oi whisky. Joe Smith saw at once that he had met his match, and that Keokuk was not the proper material with which to increase his army of dupes, and closed the conference in as amiable a manner as possible. \" He was gifted by nature with the elements of an orator in an eminent de gree, and as such is entitled to rank with Logan, Red Jacket and Tecumseh ; but, unfortunately for his fame among the white people and with posterity, he was never able to obtain an interpreter who could claim even a slight acquaint ance with philosophy. With one exception only, his interpreters were unac quainted even with the elements of their mother-tongue. Of this serious hindrance to his fame, Keokuk was well aware, and retained Frank Labashure, who had received a rudimental education in the French and English languages, until the latter broke down by dissipation and died. But during the meridian of his career among the white people, he was compelled to submit his speeches for translation to uneducated men, whose range of thought fell below the flights of a gifted mind, and the fine imagery, drawn from nature, was beyond their"], [336, "344 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. powers of reproduction. He had sufficient knowledge of the English tongue to make him sensible of this bad rendering of his thought, and often a feeling of mortification at the bungling efforts was depicted upon his countenance while he was speaking. The proper place to form a due estimate of his ability as an orator was in the Indian council, where he addressed himself exclusively to those who understood his language, and where the electric effects of his elo quence could be plainly noted upon his audience. It was credibly asserted that by the force of his logic he had changed the vote of a council against the strongly predetermined opinions of its members. A striking instance of the influence of his eloquence is related as occurring while the forces under Black Hawk were invading Illinois, in 1832. \"Keokuk knew from the first that this reckless war would result in great disaster to the tribe, and used all diligence to dissuade warriors from following Black Hawk, and succeeded in retaining a majority with him at his town on the Iowa River. But, after Stillman's defeat, the war-spirit raged with such ardor that a war-dance was held, and Keokuk took part in it, seeming to be moved with the current of the rising storm, and when the dance was over, he called a council to prepare for war. In his address he admitted the justice of his complaints against the white man, and to seek redress was a noble aspiration of their natures. The blood of their brethren had been shed by the white man, and the spirits of their braves slain in battle called loudly for vengeance. ' I am your chief,' he said, ' and it is my duty to lead you to battle, if, after fully considering the matter you are determined to go. But, before you take this important step, it is wise to inquire into the chances for success.' He then represented to them the great power of the United States, against whom they would have to contend \u2014 that their chances of success were utterly hopeless. ' But if you now determine to go upon the war-path, I will agree to lead you upon one condition \u2014 that before we go we kill all our old men and our wives and children to save them from a lingering death by starvation, and that every one of us determine to leave his bones on the other side of the Mississippi.' \" This was a strong and truthful picture of the project before them, and was presented in such a forcible light as to cool their ardor and to cause them to abandon their rash undertaking. Many other incidents are related of his elo quence and tact in allaying a rising storm, fraught with war and bloodshed, not only in his own tribe, but also among neighboring tribes, where his people had been the aggressors. Some of these incidents have been preserved by writers on Indian research, but many will be lost to history. He delivered a eulogy upon Gen. Harrison at the Sac and Fox Agency, which was interpreted by Mr. Antoine Le Claire, and considered by many who heard its delivery, as one of his best efforts. This speech, however, was not written down and is lost to his tory ; but enough of the incidents of his career as an orator have been saved from the wreck of time to stamp his reputation for natural abilities of the high est order, and furnish another positive refutation of Buffon's theory on the deterioration of men and animals on the American Continent. \"We have thus far portrayed the bright side of Keokuk's character; but like most, if not all, great intellects, there is a dark background which the truth of history demands shall be brought to view. His traits of character, thus far sketched, may not inaptly be compared to the great Grecian orator ; but here the similitude ends. The great blot on Keokuk's life was his inordi nate love of money, and, toward its close, he became a confirmed inebriate. His withering reply to the Mormon prophet was intended by him as a pure stroke of wit ; it, nevertheless, expressed his ruling passions."], [337, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 345 \"A bitter and incurable feud existed in the tribe during their time of resi dence on the Des Moines River, between what was denominated 'Keokuk's band' and 'Black Hawk's band,' the latter recognizing Hardfish as their leader. This distrust, and, indeed, hatred were smothered in their common inter course when sober ; but when their blood was fired with whisky, it sometimes assumed a tragic feature amongst the leaders of the respective bands. An instance of this character occurred on the lower part of the Des Moines, on a return of a party making a visit to the ' half-breeds ' at the town of Keokuk, on the Mississippi. In a quarrel, excited by whisky, Keokuk received a dan gerous stab in the breast from a son of Black Hawk. The writer of the pres ent sketch saw him conveyed by his friends homeward, lying in a canoe, unable to rise. \" Hardfish and his coadjutors lost no occasion to find fault with Keokuk's administration. The payments were made in silver coin, put in boxes, contain ing $500 each, and passed into Keokuk's hands for distribution. The several traders received each his quota, according to their several demands against the tribes admitted by Keokuk, which invariably consumed the far greater portion of the amount received. The remainder was turned over to the chiefs, and dis tributed among their respective bands. Great complaints were made of these allowances to the traders, on the ground of exorbitant prices charged on the goods actually furnished, and it was alleged that some of these accounts were spurious. In confirmation of this last charge, over and above the character of the items exhibited in these accounts, an affidavit was filed with Gov. Lucas by an individual, to which the Governor gave credence, setting forth that Keokuk had proposed to the maker of the affidavit to prefer a purely fictitious account against the tribe for the sum of $10,000, and he would admit its correctness, and when paid, the money should be divided among themselves, share and share alike. To swell the traders' bills, items were introduced of a character that showed fraud upon their face, such as a large number of 'blanket coats,' arti cles which the Indians never wore, and 'telescopes,' of the use of which they had no knowledge. This shows the reckless manner in which these bills were swollen to the exorbitant amounts complained of, in which Keokuk was openly charged with being in league with the traders to defraud Hardfish's band. At this time, the nation numbered about two thousand three hundred souls, and only about one-third of the whole number belonged to Keokuk's party. Gov. Lucas warmly espoused the popular side in the controversy that arose in rela tion to the mode and manner of making the annual payment, and the matter was referred to the Indian Bureau, and the mode was changed, so that payments were made to the heads of families, approximating a per-capita distribution. This method of making the payments met the unqualified disapprobation of the traders, and after one year's trial, fell back into the old channel. Keokuk led his tribe west to the Kansas country, in 1845, and, according to reports, died some years after of delirium tremens.\" Mr. James Jordan relates the following anecdote of Keokuk: \"In 1837, the chief's son was prostrated with fever. Keokuk was absent at the time, but there chanced to be in the camp an old squaw, who was alleged to be invested with supernatural powers. When Keokuk returned, his valiant heir informed him that the witch had cast an evil spirit into the settlement, which had increased the fever and rendered it impossible to overcome disease while she lived. Thereupon Keokuk took the old woman without the settlement and deliberately cut off her head with a cleaver. This summary act was witnessed by Mrs. Phelps, wife of Billy Phelps, one of the original locators of that sec-"], [338, "346 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. tion.\" The scene of this sacrifice was near Independent, adjacent to Jordan's farm. Keokuk's son is at the head of the Sac and Fox Nation, in the Indian Ter *\" RTAsll,- IfAWlT. THT55 TVR.AVF!. BLACK HAWK, THE BRAVE. The most conspicuous figure in the list of noted Indians of the Northwest is Black Hawk. This remarkable man was more like a white man in his domestic tastes and instincts than any of his cotemporaries ; but was, withal, a warrior of the true savage type. During his sojourn in Van Buren County, probably no one was more intimately acquainted with Black Hawk than James Jordan was. Mr. Jordan's opportunities for knowing the Indian, and also for acquiring a thorough knowledge of the language in which he spoke, were unusual. For years, the two families lived side by side, and maintained a degree of intimacy peculiar and incidental to the isolated life then led. A feeling of friendliness sprang up between the native and the pioneer resident, which was but little removed from that of brotherhood. Hence it is that the statements of Mr. Jordan relative to Black Hawk and his life are accepted without reser vation by all who hear them. In personal appearance, Black Hawk was distinguished. He was five feet and eleven inches tall ; weighed about one hundred and forty to one hundred and fifty pounds, and had an eye black and piercing as a wild beast. Many errors have crept into history concerning Black Hawk. The most important one is that which fixes his birth in 1767. It will be observed in the State history, which precedes this sketch, that he was born in the Sac village, about three miles from the junction of Rock River with the Mississippi, in Illinois, in 1767. Mr. Jordan pronounces the date an error. From Black Hawk's own lips he learned that the time of his birth was 1775, but the day is not given. As to the Indian orthography of the name, Mr. Jordan gives Mu-ca-tali mich-a-ka-kah, and this is confirmed by several other well-posted persons. Maj. Beach, in his admirable papers on the Indian Agency in Wapello County, a subject he was well fitted to write about, because of his having been Agent after Gen. Street's death in 1840, gives a slightly different spelling ; but only such as might naturally arise from an attempt to spell an Indian word by sound. The Major spelled the name Muck-a-ta-mish-e-ki-ak-ki-ak, and the reader will observe the general similarity in the two methods. Probably Mr. Jordan's way is the correct one. The literal translation of the name into English is a black hawk. Another error exists concerning the official position of the man. He was not a chief, either by inheritance or election. His father was a leading spirit, perhaps a prophet or a man of commanding influence in the councils of the Sacs. At an early age, Black Hawk was allowed to don the war-paint, because of his having slain an enemy of his tribe. This rather traditionary statement comes unsupported, but is given for what it is worth. The story runs that the youth was but sixteen years old when he hung his first scalp upon his wigwam. In character the Indian boy was brave, cautious and ambitious. He aspired to rank and sought the gratification of his passion for power by stealthy means. He possessed marvelous oratorical abilities, in that gift equaling the great speaker Keokuk. As a warrior, he was dependent more upon strategy than upon the qualities which white men deem essential to military prowess ; but Black Hawk was not a cruel or blood-thirsty man who slew merely for the sake of slaughter. He was a paradox in some characteristics, and the report given"], [339, "347 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. by Mr. Jordan, of his latter days, contradicts the generally believed accounts of his early methods of self-promotion. However, one can accept the statements of his friend without too great a tax on one's credulity, when it is remembered that the last years, and not the first, were spent in this vicinity. Black Hawk the youth was very different from Black Hawk the old and defeated man. History teaches that Black Hawk's efforts at generalship were failures, when military method was required. His power lay in sudden and fierce attacks, with dramatic strategy and rush of mounted braves. It was by such means, and the employment of his great eloquence in council, that he gained his eminence as a leader. He assumed the place of authority over Keokuk, his ranking officer, and maintained his hold upon his men without ever claiming to be a chieftain. He called himself a Brave, and delighted in the title. The Sacs and Foxes, according to their traditions, once dwelt upon the shores of the great lakes. Gradually they were pushed westward, until in time they came to occupy a large portion of Northern Illinois. In spite of the press ure of the whites, this band occupied a site on the east shore of the Missis sippi, near Rock River. Here Black Hawk was, in 1832, the controlling spirit. \"He was never a chief, either by inheritance or election,\" declares Major Beach, \" and his influence was shared by a wily old savage, of part Winne bago blood, called the Prophet, who could do with Black Hawk pretty much as he pleased ; and also by a Sac named Na-pope, the English of which is Soup, and whom the writer found to be a very friendly and manageable old native, as was also Black Hawk.\" As relevant to the history of the Indian occupation of Van Buren County, we quote from a paper prepared by Uriah Biggs, and published in the \"Annals of Iowa,\" the following authentic account of Black Hawk's first battle. The battle-field was on the present site of Iowaville, which was long ago the prin cipal seat of the Iowa natijn of Indians, and was where Black Hawk after ward died. At the time of the massacre, Black Hawk was a young man, and the graphic account of his first steps toward leadership, as related by Mr. Biggs, is made up of the details given by the Indians who participated in the battle : \" Contrary to long established custom of Indian attack, this battle was brought on in daytime, the attending circumstances justifying this departure from the well-settled usages of Indian warfare. The battle-field is a level river bottom prairie, of about four miles in length and two miles wide, near the middle, narrowing down to points at either end. The main area of the bottom rises perhaps twenty feet above the river, leaving a narrow strip of low bottom along the river, covered with trees that belted the prairie on the river-side with a thick forest, and the river-bank was fringed with a dense growth of willows. Near the lower end of the prairie, and near the river-bank, was situated the Iowa village, and about two miles above the town and near the middle of the prairie, is situated a small natural mound, covered at that time with a tuft of small trees and brush growing on its summit. \" In the rear of this mound lay a belt of wet prairie, which, at the time here spoken of, was covered with a dense crop of rank coarse grass ; bordering this wet prairie on the north, the country rises abruptly into elevated and broken river-bluffs, covered with a heavy forest for many miles in extent, por tions of it thickly clustered with undergrowth, affording a convenient shelter for the stealthy approach of the cat-like foe. Through this forest the Sac and Fox war-party made their way in the night-time, and secreted themselves in the tall grass spoken of above, intending to remain in ambush through the day,"], [340, "348 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. and make such observations as this near proximity to their intended victims might afford, to aid them in the contemplated attack on the town during the following night. From this situation their spies could take a full survey of the situation of the village, and watch every movement of the inhabitants, by which means they were soon convinced the Iowas had no suspicion of their presence. \"At the foot of the mound above noticed, the Iowas had their race-course, where they diverted themselves with the excitements of the horse, and skilled their young warriors in cavalry evolutions. In these exercises, mock battles are fought, and the Indian tactics of attack and defense, of victory and defeat, are carefully inculcated, by which means a skill in horsemanship is acquired which is rarely excelled. Unfortunately for them, this day was selected for these equestrian sports, and, wholly unconscious of the proximity of their foes, the warriors repaired to the race-ground, leaving the most of their arms in the village, and their old men and women and children unprotected. \" Pashapaho, who was chief in command of the enemy's forces, perceived at once the advantage this state of things afforded for a complete surprise of his now doomed victims, and ordered Black Hawk to file off with his young warriors through the tall grass, and gain the cover of the timber along the river-bank, and, with the utmost speed reach the village and commence the battle, while he remained with his division in the ambush, to make a simulta neous assault on the unarmed men, whose attention was engrossed with the excitement of the races. The plan was skillfully laid and most dexterously prosecuted. Black Hawk, with his forces, reached the village undiscovered and made a furious onslaught upon its defenseless inhabitants, by firing one general volley into their midst, and completing the slaughter with the tomahawk and scalping-knife, aided by the devouring flames with which they engulfed the vil lage as soon as the fire-brand could be spread from lodge to lodge. \" On the instant of the report of fire-arms at the village, the forces under Pashapaho leaped from their couchant position in the grass, and sprang tiger like upon the astonished and unarmed Iowas in the midst of their racing sports. The first impulse of the latter naturally led them to make the utmost speed to reach their arms in the village, and protect, if possible, their wives and children from the attacks of the merciless assailants. \" The distance from the place of the attack on the prairie was two miles, and a great number fell in the flight by the bullets and tomahawks of their adversaries, who pressed them closely with a running fire the whole way, and they only reached their town in time to witness the horrors of its destruction. Their whole village was in flames, and the dearest objects of their lives lay in slaughtered heaps amidst the devouring element, and the agonizing groans of the dying mingled with the exulting shouts of a victorious foe, filled their hearts with a maddening despair. Their wives and children who had been spared the general massacre were prisoners, and, together with their arms, were in posses sion of the victors, and all that could now be done was to draw off their shat tered and defenseless forces and save as many lives as possible by a retreat across the Des Moines River, which they effected in the best possible manner, and took a position among the Soap Creek hills. \" The complete success attending a battle does not always imply brave action, for, as in the present instance, bravery does not belong to a wanton attack on unarmed men and defenseless women and children. Yet it is due to Pasha paho, as a commander of an army, to give him full credit for his quick per ception of the advantages circumstances had placed within his reach, and for"], [341, "349 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. his sagacity in at once changing the programme of attack to meet occurring events, and the courage and intrepidity to seize these events and insure his suc cess. The want of these essential qualities in a commander has occasioned the loss of many a battle in what is courteously termed civilized warfare. \" The Iowas, cut off from all hope of retrieving their loss, sent a flag of truce to Pashapaho, submitting their fate to the will of their conqueror, and a parley ensued which resulted in the Iowas becoming an integral part of the Sac and Fox nation ; but experiencing the ill-usage that is the common fate of a conquered people, they besought the United States authorities to purchase their undivided interest in the country and thus allow them to escape from the tyranny of their oppressors. The purchase was accordingly made in 1825, and they removed to the Missouri River, and have so wasted in numbers as to scarcely preserve their existence as an independent tribe. The sole cause of this war was the insatiable ambition of the Sac and Fox Indians, as this was their first acquaintance with the Iowa nation or tribe.\" Mr. Biggs differs from other writers concerning some points in Black Hawk's character. We give the following description from his pen : \" My first and only interview with Black Hawk was at Rock Island, at the time of the treaty for the Iowa Reserve, in 1836, about one year before his death. I was introduced to him by his intimate acquaintance and apologist, the late Jeremiah Smith, of Burlington. He asked where I resided, and being told on the Wabash River, in Indiana, he traced on the sand the principal Western rivers, showing their courses and connections, and exhibiting a general knowledge of the prominent features of the topography of the Western States. \" The interview occurred after his first visit to Washington, where he was taken by way of the Ohio River to Pittsburgh, and returned by Philadelphia, Baltimore, Albany, Buffalo and Detroit, affording him a good opportunity to form a salutary impression of the military resources of the United States, and also to acquire a general knowledge of its geography. Its great military strength seemed to arouse his keenest observation, and furnished the main topic of his remarks upon the country as he passed through, as well as on his return to his tribe. The colloquy at this interview afforded an occasion to express his bitter reflections upon this painful theme. Mr. Smith, unfortunately for the repose of Black Hawk's feelings, and unconscious of its effect, mentioned the writer of this sketch as a surveyor of public lands, a character always unwelcome among the Indians. This remark I much regretted, as Black Hawk's counte nance was instantly covered with gloom, and he rather petulantly said : ' The Shomokoman was strong, and would force the Indians to give up all their lands.' \" The colloquy here ended, as this barbed arrow, inadvertently thrown by Mr. Smith, had occasioned a tumult in Black Hawk's mind that rendered fur ther conversation on his part disagreeable. The impressions of the writer in regard to Black Hawk's personal appearance were those of disappointment. He was attired in a coarse cloth coat, without any semblance of fit or proportion, with his feet thrust into a pair of new stoga shoes that were without strings, and a coarse wool hat awkwardly placed on his nearly bald pate, and present ing a very uncouth and rather ludicrous personal bearing. \" This toggery, perhaps, had its share in lowering my previously-estimated claims of Black Hawk to distinction among the celebrated men of his race. 'The fine head, Roman style of face, and prepossessing countenance,' that so favorably impressed the distinguished author of the ' Sketch Book,' on visiting him while a prisoner in Jefferson Barracks, were no longer apparent to my dull comprehension."], [342, "350 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. \"It would, indeed, be difficult to find a name in history that attained so great a notoriety, associated with such limited mental endowment and true mili tary skill. Every prominent act of his life gave evidence of the lack of sound discretion and prudent forethought. We find him as early as^ 1804 visiting the Spanish Governor at St. Louis, at the time the United States' agents called to accept the transfer of the authority of the country. Black Hawk being informed of the purpose of their visit, refused to meet these agents of the new government, he passing out of one door as they entered at the other, and embarking with his suite in their canoes and hastening away to Rock Island, saying he liked his Spanish father best. This was a mere whim, as he had, as yet, no acquaintance with the Government and people of the United States. He, however, at once determined on hostility to both ; and this ill-ad vised and hasty determination was his ruling passion while he lived. \" Lieutenant Pike, on behalf of the Government, made him a friendly visit to Rock Island, the following year, and, as a token of friendship, presented Black Hawk with an American flag, which he refused to accept. He embraced the first opportunity that offered to form an alliance with the British authorities in Canada, and eagerly attached himself and 500 warriors of his tribe to the British standard, at the commencement of the war of 1812. Here, his lack of capacity to command an army, where true courage and enduring fortitude were requisite to success, was fully demonstrated. His warlike talents had hitherto been only tested in stealthy and sudden onslaughts on unprepared and defense less foes : and, if successful, a few scalps were the laurels he coveted, and he retired, exulting in the plunder of a village and these savage trophies. His campaigns against the Osages and other neighboring tribes, lasted only long enough to make one effort, and afforded no evidence of the fortitude and patient skill of the able military leader. His conduct under the British flag as 'Gen eral Black Hawk ' showed him entirely wanting in the capacity to deserve that title. He followed the English army to Fort Stephenson, in expectation of an easy slaughter and pillage ; but the signal repulse the combined forces still met by the gallant Col. Croghan, completely disheartened him, and he slipped away with about twenty of his followers to his village on Rock River, leaving his armv to take care of themselves. \" He entertained no just conception of the obligations of treaties made between our Government and his tribe, and even the separate treaty by himself and his ' British Band,' in 1816, was no check on his caprice and stolid self will, and its open violation brought on the war of 1832, which resulted in his complete overthrow, and ended forever his career as a warrior. \" The history of his tour through the United States as a prisoner, is a severe reflection upon the intelligence of the people of our Eastern cities, in regard to the respect due to a savage leader who had spent a long life in butchering his own race, and the frontier inhabitants of their own race and country. His journey was, everywhere throughout the East, an ovation, falling but little short of the respect and high consideration shown to the nation's great benefactor, La Fayette, whose triumphal tour through the United States' happened near the same period. But as an offset to this ridiculous adulation in the East, when the escort reached Detroit, where his proper estimate was understood, Black Hawk and his suite were contemptuously burned in effigy. But due allowance should be made for the ignorance concerning true Indian character, among the Eastern people, as their conceptions are formed from the fanciful creations of the Coopers and Longfellows, immensely above the sphere of the blood-thirsty War Eagles and the filthy, paint-bedaubed Hiawathas of real savage life."], [343, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 351 \" Black Hawk died in the fall of 1838, near Iowaville, the scene of his triumph, under Pashapaho, over the Iowas in the early part of his warlike career. He was buried in a sitting posture, in a frail tomb made of wooden slabs set upon the ground in the form of an inverted V. His war-club, a shaved post four or five feet high, was placed in the front of his rude tomb, upon which a great number of black stripes was painted, corresponding with the number of scalps he had taken during life. Openings were left in his tomb so that his friends and curious visitors could witness the progress of decay. Some time after the removal of his friends higher up the river, and after the flesh had wasted away, a Dr. Turner, of Van Buren County, removed his skeleton to Alton, 111., and had the bones handsomely polished and varnished, preparatory to connecting them by wires in the skeleton form. When Black Hawk's wife heard of the exhumation, she affected great and incontrollable grief, and poured out the burden of her sorrows to Robert Lucas, Governor of the Territory, and ex officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who promptly recovered the bones and placed them in a box in his office at Burlington, and dispatched a message to the bereaved family, then staying on the Des Moines, some ninety miles dis tant. A cavalcade was soon in motion, bearing the disconsolate widow and a retinue of her friends to Burlington. On the evening of their arrival, the Gov ernor was notified of their readiness to wait upon him, who fixed the audience for 10 A. M. the next day. Several visitors were in attendance. The box containing the august remains opened with a lid, and when the parties were all assembled and ready for the awful development, the lid was lifted by the Gov ernor, fully exposing the sacred relics of the renowned chief to the gaze of his sorrowing friends and the very respectable auditors who had assembled to wit ness the impressive scene. \" The Governor then addressed the widow, through John Goodell, the inter preter of the Hardfish band, giving all the details of the transfer of the bones from the grave to Quincy and back to Burlington, and assured her that they were the veritable bones of her deceased husband ; that he had sympathized deeply with her in her great affliction, and that he now hoped she would be consoled and comforted by the return of the precious relics to her care, under a strong confidence that they would not again be disturbed where she might choose to entomb them. The widow then advanced to the lid of the box, and, without the least seeming emotion, picked up in her fingers bone after bone, and examined each with the seeming curiosity of a child, and, replacing each bone in its proper place, turned to the interpreter, and replied that she fully believed they were Black Hawk's bones, and that she knew the Governor was a good old man, or he would not have taken the great pains he had manifested to oblige her, and, in consideration of his great benevolence and disinterested friendship, she would leave the bones under his care and protection. The con ference then closed, and the distinguished visitors took leave of the Governor and the assembled auditors. This scene was detailed by the Governor to the present writer while standing at the side of the famous box soon after its occurrence. \" On the accession of Gen. Harrison to the Presidency, Gov. Lucas was removed from the gubernatorial office of the Territory, and removed his private office into the same room with Dr. Enos Lowe, now of Omaha City, Nebraska. An historical society was organized in Burlington about this time, and an effort was made to get these relics into their cabinet and under the control of their society. This arrangement was never formally effected ; but, in the course of events, they happened to be in the same building with the society's collection,"], [344, "352 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. and the whole were consumed in the burning of the building, which occurred later.\" On page 74 of this volume is given the generally accepted version of the causes which led to the Black Hawk war of 1832 ; but that story is vague and unsatisfactory. On page 157 another, and in the main a correct, account is given. From Mr. Jordan we learn facts of more than local interest in this dis puted case, and give them here. Somewhere about 1828-29, a man named Watts, while driving cattle through this region, about where Iowaville now is, was beset by Indians. Watts had with him a man whose name is not remembered now. This man was killed by a savage. The murder was committed on Indian territory, and a demand was made on Black Hawk for the criminal. He was delivered up to the United States authorities and taken to St. Louis, where he was tried and condemned. Some of the tribe went to St. Louis to intercede for their companion, but did not accomplish their purpose. The Indian was hanged. However, while the Indians were in St. Louis they fell victims of sharpers, who obtained a professed title to Black Hawk's village, on the Rock River, by presents of less value than the Government price of the land. When the embassy returned with their ill gotten trinkets, Black Hawk was wroth, and denounced the fraud. Subse quently, probably the next spring, on the opening of the season of 1830, the men who had obtained such title to the land came on, and drove the Indian women and children from the village, during the temporary absence of the braves. Black Hawk made issue with the fraudulent possessors of his home, and offered to stake thirty of his braves against thirty white soldiers to test the question of title by a fight. This offer was declined by the military, but the whites said they would pit the United States army against the Indians of his tribe. Black Hawk took up the gauntlet, and hence the famous, but disastrous, Black Hawk war. This version, it will be seen, substantially corroborates the story obtained by research in Illinois. Of the Black Hawk war it is not within the province of this sketch to speak ; it belongs to the history of Illinois, and has been repeatedly written up. After the defeat of Black Hawk, in 1832, he was captured and taken to Prairie du Chien. After an imprisonment in Jefferson Barracks, and, subsequently, in Fortress Monroe, whither he was taken, he was returned at the intercession of Keokuk to this region. In his old age, Black Hawk sought the company of the garrison, his band was broken up, and the once great man was left alone in his declining years. Maj. Beach relates the following incident derived from personal observation : \"Black Hawk's lodge was always the perfection of cleanliness, a quite unu sual thing for an Indian. The writer has seen the old woman busily at work with her broom, by time of sunrise, sweeping down the little ant-hills in the yard that had been thrown up during the night. As the chiefs of the nation seemed to pay him but little attention in the waning years of his life, Gen. Street, the Agent, looked out for his comfort more carefully than otherwise he would have thought it needful to do, and, among other things, gave him a cow \u2014 an appendage to an Indian's domestic establishment hitherto unheard of. The old squaw and daughter were instructed in the art of milking her, and she was held among them in almost as great reverence as the sacred ox Apis was held among the ancient Egyptians. \" This was in the summer of 1838, when the Agency was in process of erection, and Black Hawk had established his lodge on the banks of the Des"], [345, "353 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Moines, about three miles below Eldon. Close by was the trading-house of Wharton McPherson, with whom the writer stayed one night in August of said year (1838), and, as he rode past the lodge, Mme. Black Hawk was compla cently sitting upon a log by the side of her cow, under a heavily-branched tree, industriously brushing the flies and mosquitoes from the bovine with a rag tied to the end of a stick. Mr. McPherson said this was her daily occupation in fly-time, often following the animal around as it grazed at a distance. This was the last occasion that ever the writer had for an interview with Black Hawk, as he died within two months of that time (September 15, 1838), and was even then so infirm that he could barely move about his wigwam.\" Still another mooted question is that concerning the death, burial and resur rection of Black Hawk, for the old brave was not permitted to rest in his tomb after his fitful life-fever was over. The best authority on this subject is Mr. Jor dan. From him the following statement was obtained : On the 1st day of September, 1838, Mu-ca-tah-mich-a-ka-kah sickened with fever. The old brave requested Mr. Jordan to send to Fort Edward (now Warsaw) for Dr. Peel. A letter was duly dispatched, in which the doctor was promised the sum of $300 if he would attend the summons. The message was slow in going, and before a response could be made the soul of the brave old Indian had passed to the happy hunting-ground. Black Hawk died September 15, 1838, in the sixty-third year of his life. Be fore he died, he requested Mr. Jordan to observe certain ceremonies in his burial. His body was to be clothed in full uniform, a suit of military clothes presented him by Gen. Jackson, upon which was a pair of epaulets valued at $500. Three med als, which had been given him by the British, the French and the American Governments, respectively, and valued in the aggregate at $1,200, were to be placed upon his breast. .He was to be buried in a sitting posture, and a mound of earth erected above him in such a manner as to leave an unobstructed view of the interior, through orifices left for the purpose. The locality was designa ted by Black Hawk himself, as the site of his last friendly council with the Iowa Indians. This point was upon Mr. Jordan's farm, on Section 2, Town ship 70 north, Range 12 west. The injunction was faithfully carried out. The body was dressed as the brave had directed, and blankets and gloves were added. Some time later, Mrs. Black Hawk came to Mr. Jordan with the alarming story that her hus band's head had been stolen. Upon investigating the sepulcher it was found that the head had dropped over from its own weight. Mr. Jordan replaced the member and repaired the tomb. The alarm thus given was not entirely groundless, however, for on the 3d of July, 1839, Dr. Turner stole the head and made off with it. In February, 1840, the act of desecration was completed, when the entire body was removed. It was taken to Alton, 111., and there the bones were cleaned and wired by a professional anatomist. Mrs. Black Hawk and her sons made a disturbance over the affair, and the matter was taken up by Gov. Lucas. The widow painted her face with black, in spots, and passed two days without food, in mournino-, walking up and down the river-bank. When at last the bones were discovered, the family was notified and visited Burlington. They saw that the skeleton \"was in a good, dry place,\" and concluded to let it remain there. Maj. Beach said that he notified the widow of the willingness of the authori ties to surrender the bones, but that she seemed indifferent to the matter. At all events, nothing was done by the family to secure a re-interment of the remains. Subsequently, the State building in which the remains were placed,"], [346, "354 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. at Burlington, was consumed by fire. One report says that the skeleton was destroyed therein ; but another story is that some physician had borrowed the bones to exhibit them before a class in anatomy, and that they were not in the building when it burned. The latter report is wholly improbable; for if it was true some one would know of the fact, and publicly acknowledge the existence of the skeleton. It is also said that the skull is in the Smithsonian Institution, at Washington; but that is more unreasonable than any of the wild inventions. The truth is, probably, that Black Hawk found a final earthly resting-place amid the ashes of the ruined structure, and that the last act of his eventful career was not less dramatic than the first public appearance of the brave. Literally and truthfully may we say, dust to dust, ashes to ashes; and may they rest in peace. Black Hawk's wife and sons are dead. A daughter is living with the Sac and Fox nation, near Fort Sill. An incident or two will not be out of place here: It is asserted that, during the troubles of 1812, the British Government offered Black Hawk a medal and $5,000 worth of blankets to fight for them. He accepted the offer, for he never liked the United States Government over well, and signified his readiness to move his men. He then found that the British commander insisted upon his giving up his authority over his own braves and intrusting it to an English officer. This arrangement he scorned, and giv ing the order of stampede to his men, they dashed away like shot from a can non's mouth. This scene is located at Maiden, near Detroit. Black Hawk used to boast that he never killed a prisoner. He had capt ured many, but had treated them magnanimously. This, we infer, relates to white prisoners. ADVENT OF THE WHITE MAN. Having traced the existence of the two preliminary races \u2014 the Mound- Builders and the Indians \u2014 which dwelt within the region of the Des Moines, we introduce, in regular order, the pale-faced intruder on the domain of the savage. The first settlement in Southern Iowa was made in the vicinity of Burlington, and through that gate entered the vast army that has worked such wonders in the way of improvement. A brief description of who began the labor of developing Iowa, and how it was performed, is necessary to perfect the thread of this narrative of fact. From the pen of Dr. William R. Ross is gathered the following interesting record : \"It may not be uninteresting,\" observes the Doctor, \"to give some of the names of those who first explored Southern Iowa, in 1832, prior to making a permanent settlement in 1833. First, among others, were Maj. Joseph B. Teas and Joseph Morgan, afterward citizens of Albia; Col. William Morgan, William Stewart, John Ward, Isaac Canterberg, Lewis Watters, Isaac Cranshaw, Ben jamin Tucker, Ezekiel Smith and sons Paris and Lineas, John Bullard. Richard Sand, Thomas Dovreil, David Tethro, S. S. White, M. M. McCarver, Berryman Jenkins, William Wright, John Harris and Charles Teas, with others that were in Iowa when I came in July, 1833. Mrs. Sarah Hilleary, wife of Alexander Hilleary, near Burlington, came with her father, Col. William Mor gan, in February, 1832, to do the domestic work, while her father was improv ing his claim and building a house preparatory to moving his family, and was one of the families driven on the big island just below Burlington, by soldiers from Rock Island, as the Indian title had not been extinguished."], [347, "355 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. \"The title remained in the Indians until June, 1833. At this time, Rich ard Chaney resided at Fort Madison, and Dr. Garland and Mr. Campbell, and, perhaps, a few others on the half-breed tract. After June 1, 1833, the country was settled very rapidly ; as every one then had the liberty of taking to them selves a claim of half a section of land, one-quarter of timber and one of prairie, and the right to purchase as many claims as he had the money for. This rule occasioned much disturbance by new immigrants coming into the country and finding one man holding more than one claim. It drove them back into the new region against their will. In the winter of 1833-34, we were attached to Michigan Territory for judicial purposes, and the laws, with instructions, were sent me by the Legislature of Michigan to organize Des Moines County, by appointing special elections to be held to elect officers to discharge the duties of an organized county. Col. William Morgan was elected Superior Judge, and Henry Walker and Young L. Hughes, Assistants, of Circuit Court, which was the highest court we had in Iowa at that time. Col. W. H. Chapman was Prosecuting Attorney ; W. R. Ross, Clerk ; Solomon Perkins, Sheriff ; John Barker, Justice of the Peace ; W. R. Ross, Treasurer and Recorder, and, at the time, acting Postmaster in the only post office in the Territory. He was the only practicing physician in that part of the Territory, meanwhile carrying on a dry goods and drug store. In addition to this, Mr. Ross inclosed, in 1834, 160 acres of prairie land with a stake-and-rider fence, grew eighty acres of corn, on another claim, and improved still another forty acres back of Burling ton. He also improved some twenty acres, and erected buildings for a private residence. \" There was a settlement from near the mouth of Long Creek, northeast of Augusta, made by six or seven families from Indiana, in July, 1833, eight miles west of Burlington. \" In regard to public improvements, in the fall of 1833, Mr. Ross built the first schoolhouse, on his claim just back of the public square, at his own expense, and, in the spring of 1834, Z. C. Ingraham was employed to teach. Mr. Ross boarded him free of cost. This was the first English school taught in Iowa. In 1834, Mr. Ross organized the first Sunday school in Iowa, furnishing a library from Cincinnati, at a cost of $12.50, and taught the school himself. As the population increased, a new library was needed ; the old one was donated to Mt. Pleasant, where a school had been organized, and a new lot of books, cost ing $25, was put in. Of those denominations who joined in the work of main taining the school, Mr. Ross remembers: Mr. and Mrs. J. Edwards, W. H. Starr (then a lawyer, of the Congregational faith); George Partridge (who became a wholesale merchant of St. Louis), of the Unitarian faith ; David Rover, of the Presbyterian faith; John B. Gray, of the Baptist faith. Mr. Newhall and Dr. John Campbell are warmly spoken of in this connection, also. \" The day school was taught by Mrs. Shelton and Mrs. Mayfield; and after the old Zion M. E. Church was built, Rev. E. M. Scott, the tallest man in the neighborhood, lived in the basement of the church and taught school therein. Afterward a man named Townsend taught. \" Dr. Crawford, from Brooke County, Va., settled in Burlington in 1833 ; he practiced during the winter, and then moved to Texas. In the spring of 1834, Drs. Shuff, of Kentucky, and Center of Indiana, located in Burlington, and formed a partnership. Center died within the year, and Shuff returned to Kentucky. Dr. Teas practiced in 1835. Dr. D. W. Hickock, of New York, located there in 1835, and remained until his death. Dr. S. S. Ransom, of o"], [348, "356 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Vermont, settled there about the same date. Dr. E. Lowe, of Indian, came in 1836 ; he afterward removed to Omaha. \" The first court ever held in Southern Iowa, convened at the house of Mr. Ross, on the block immediately east of the public square, in the spring of 1835. Judges presiding: William Morgan, Henry Walker and Young R. Hughes. Resident lawyers: W. W. Chapman, Robert Williams, Isaac Leffler, Joseph B. Teas. Visiting lawyers: Mr. Little, of Carthage, 111., and James W. Woods, usually called \"Old Timber.\" Mr. Ross owned the only law library then in Burlington, and that was a small one. In the spring of 1836, David Rover began the practice of law; in 1836\u201437, M. D. Browning and J. W. Grimes, also. In 1836-37, Joseph B. Teas and Jeremiah Smith, Jr., rep resented Des Moines at the Legislature which organized the Territory of Iowa. In the spring of 1838, Charles Mason moved to Burlington and began the practice of law. There was an exodus of lawyers from that place about then. J. C. Hall, William Thompson, J. B. and G. W. Teas and Van Allen located at Mt. Pleasant; Thomas and Springer, at Wapello, Louisa County; Daniel Miller and Rich, at Ft. Madison. \"In 1837-38, the Territory was established, and Burlington made the capital. The first session was held in the old Zion Church. \"In March, 1834, Barton H. Cartright preached in Burlington. Asa McMurtry preached for two weeks, shortly after. W. D. R. Trotter followed. In May, 1834, Peter Cartright held two days' camp-meeting near the public square. In the winter of 1834-35, Seamen B. Stateter, of the Missouri Con ference, formed the Burlington Circuit, and appointed John H. Ruble preacher in charge. This Circuit included all the territory south of Rock Island to the southern boundary, and west to the Missouri River. In 1835-36, Andrew Monroe held quarterly meeting. In May, Mr. Ruble died, and Peter Brown, of Quincy, 111., preached his funeral sermon. Wilson Pitner supplied the place for a short time. Nicholas S. Barton next preached, and in 1837, Moses McMurtry had charge. In 1839, Asa West followed, and, in 1840, J. Ar vington, as preachers on the Circuit. Isaac S. Stewart was located preacher in charge of the Burlington Church.\" In 1838, Gen. Joseph Street was transferred from the Agency of the Win nebagoes at Praire du Chien, Wis., to Iowa, for the purpose of establishing a military outpost for the protection of the general interests of the Government. He made a barrack at Agency City, in Wapello County, and may be esteemed the first white man to open the onward march of the pale-faces toward Monroe County. In a dense wilderness he built up for himself a home of as comfortable a character as the times and circumstances would permit. He improved a farm and availed himself of such opportunities as lay within his reach. Joseph Smart, the interpreter, and a man named Baker, who was a blacksmith by trade, were the only white persons, beside the garrison, in the settlement. A trading-post was soon established by Messrs. Ewings & Phelps, near the Agency. In 1841, J. P. Eddy, from St. Louis, opened a trading-post where Eddy ville now stands, near the northeast corner of Monroe County. He at once secured the friendship of the Indians. Wabekeshiek, the prophet of the Sacs and Foxes, built his village on the right bank of the Des Moines, a mile above Eddy's post. The Indians grew corrupt after the passage by Congress of the bill granting annuities, growing out of the Black Hawk treaty of peace. They would not hunt or fish, and"], [349, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 357 subsisted on their grants from the Great Father. The Indians became so demoralized by the freedom from labor thus secured that the mortality of the tribe was greatly increased. The prophet told them that the cause of all their woes arose from the relinquishment of their lands to the Government. There is something sad in the spectacle of a once powerful race of men thus driven to the extremity of extinction. In 1845, the Indians were removed entirely from the State, to reservations in Kansas. John Goodell, the interpreter of Hardfish's band, was the next to move toward Monroe County. He improved a farm not far from the line between Wapello and Monroe, known as the Ogden place, located some four miles below Eddy's post. \"In 1843,\" says Dr. Ross, \"I visited the country as far up as where Eddyville now stands, at that time an Indian village called Hardfisher. J. P. Eddy was located there as a trader with the Indians. I found a few old friends, who had made claims on both sides of the river ; among them, John B. Gray, who had located about three miles west, on Gray's Creek, in Kishkekosh County.\" J THE PIONEERS OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. The first appearance of white men in Van Buren County occurred long before local boundaries or a name marked the geographical existence of the county. As is shown by the preceding chapters relative to the trading-posts on the Des Moines, and as will be, further on, confirmed by extracts from Judge Wright's address before the Pioneer Association of Van Buren County, the first white men came into this region in 1832. There were Capt. William Phelps, Peter Avery, and possibly one or two others (but that point is not clear, and the names of those men alone are positively correct) in the trading movement. It is believed that they arrived at their destination in November, 1832. Avery spent the winter of 1832\u201433, opposite the site of Kilbourne, at the mouth of Lick Creek. The first settlements for purposes of actual improvement were made near the site of Farmington. The first man, it is claimed, to locate in the county, however, was Abel Galland, who made a claim near the site of Farmington, some time in 1833 ; but the date is not definitely given. We here give, in the way of general credit, the authorities upon which these and subsequent statements are made ; for the purpose of this work is to weave into consecutive order all information relative to the early life of this county. First, we shall hereafter quote freely, and in many places literally, from Judge George G. Wright's address, delivered August 28, 1872, before the Pioneer Association, at Keosauqua ; from the speech of A. H. McCrary ; from the speech of Edwin Manning ; from the speech of Charles Baldwin, and from other sources, obtained from Mr. Ed. Goddard, Secretary of the Pioneer Asso ciation. Where such quotations are made, we shall omit special credit or quota tion marks ; for this is not claimed as an original composition, but merely as a compilation of reliable data. With this explanation, let us proceed : Abel Galland and William Jordon, in the spring of 1833, settled at Farm ington ; and William Avery (brother of Peter) and James Jordon, the same spring, established a small trading-post at the mouth of the stream before named (Lick Creek) ; and James Lamb (who afterward, it will be remembered, was among the first of those who made the overland trip to Oregon), in 1835, settled just above where Kilbourne now is. The same year, or, at least, about this time, James Alfrey came to Farmington, and found there and and in that vicinity, in addition to those above named, John Fretwell, Jonas F. Denny,"], [350, "358 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Zeke McCarty, John Maxwell and Samuel Maxwell. Soon thereafter, we find the Swazeys, Houghtons, Crows, Henry Bateman, John Newport, H. G. Stuart, Tilford Reed, William Brattain, and above there, on the river, Dr. R. N. Cresap and Samuel C. Reed. THE FIRST BIRTH. There are, naturally, several claimants to the distinction of being the first born in Van Buren County. February 14, 1836, John M. Whitaker located in Union Township. His son, Samuel V., was born May 9, 1837. By some, this is regarded as the first birth ; but it is manifestly not so, since Jacob Alfrey was born, near Farmington, January 17, 1834. Charles Johnson, son of Abington Johnson, was born February, 1836. Humphrey Brittain, son of William Brattain, Sr., was born June 8, 1836. Mrs. Lorenzo Dow Borden, daughter of John Newort, was born, near Farmington, July 31, 1835. From these dates of the several claimants, there is no alternative but to place Jacob Alfrey as the first boy and Mrs. Borden as the first girl born in the county. If this conclusion is wrong, then the source from which the information is obtained is alone responsible. The only person who has seriously disputed this statement is Mr. A. W. Harlan, who gives a son of Jonas F. Denny the preced ence; but does not furnish the necessary date. This Denny was quite a character. He went to California, at an early day, and there became the sub ject of a novel. Mark Twain also wrote of him in \" Innocents Abroad,\" as Denny was of that famous party. THE FIRST DEATH. The first death in the county occurred near Farmington, but the exact date is not obtainable. It was, probably, as early as 1833. A man named Williams, a stranger, whose Christian name is unknown, was traveling through on horseback. He was prostrated with fever and died. He was buried in a rough puncheon box. THE FIRST MARRIAGE. The first marriage license recorded, and the first that was celebrated in the county, so far as any reliable data shows, was that of Norris Steier and Lethe M. Reed ; married June 15, 1837, by Samuel C. Reed, Justice of the Peace. ANECDOTES OF THE TRADING-POSTS. As incidental to the settlement of the region, we quote from Maj. Beach's history of the Agency such portions as refer to well-known settlers in Van Bu ren and the Indian territory immediately adjacent thereto: \" On the Des Moines, a mile or so below the County Farm, where the bluff approaches nearest to the bank, was the trading-post of P. Chouteau, Sr., & Co., but later more familiarly known as the 'Old Garrison.' This was usually superintended by Capt. William Phelps. And just above the mouth of Sugar Creek, on the creek-bank, at the old road crossing, lived the miller, Jeremiah Smith, Jr., with his family. This embraced all the whites lawfully living in the country at the time. \" Through some unfortunate misunderstanding in regard to the boundary line, several persons had intruded upon the Inaian land upon the Iowaville bottom, and the ridges in the rear, as well as upon the south side of the river, and as the Indians made complaint to the Government, it had no alternative but to remove them. This duty fell upon the writer to execute, and was a very unwelcome one, if only for the reason that several of the intruders were per-"], [351, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 359 sons who would not willingly have violated any law. Among them was that fine old specimen of West Virginia hospitality, Van Caldwell ; but by reason of his location, and his readiness by any reasonable arrangement to escape the terrors of fire and sword, the writer obtained permission from the Department that he should remain, upon the condition of his maintaining a ferry for access to Soap Creek Mills during high water. \" For some years previously to the writer's appointment as Agent, Messrs. P. Chouteau Jr. & Co., of St. Louis, had been the only traders among the Sacs and Foxes, and the magnitude of their interests was enough to excite any rivalry. Col. George Davenport, of Rock Island, had been admitted as partner to their trade with that particular tribe, and he was looked to to reside among them and to carry it on. S. S. Phelps, Esq., of Oquawka, in connection with his brother, Capt. William Phelps, of jovial memory, had been gaining a foot- hold on trade for two, three, or perhaps, four years before the treaties of 1836 and 1837, and, after the removal of the Agency from the island, and its conse- quent effect of rendering a change in the location of the chief trading-post inevitable, Col. Davenport, who had already acquired a comfortable fortune, concluded to withdraw. Mr. S. S. Phelps fell into the position thus made vacant in the company, although he relied upon his brother to reside in the In- dian country and maintain personal oversight of the company's affairs. A new trader now appeared in the field, with at least means enough to prevent the old company from being its monopolists. Of course, rivalry of feeling and interest would now spring up, and every occasion be employed by each rival to gain and secure what advantage he could. The writer is not intimating any idea of his own that any unfair or dishonorable appliances would be used by the gentlemen heads respectively of the rival establishments ; but their employes, or others hoping advantage to themselves in the success of either party, might be less scrupulous. \"It was probably through some such strategy that Gov. Lucas became im- pressed with the most sincere conviction that the Chouteau Company supplied whisky, with their other merchandise, to the Indians, and a conviction once fixed with the Governor was pretty apt to stay. So persuaded was he of the truth of his belief, that he was never disposed to the least reticence upon the subject; and it was generally believed in Burlington that if the Trading Com- pany could be caught, flagrante delicto, it would prove a pretty good haul for the catcher \u2014 certainly not less than the transfer to his own pocket of the half value of a large stock of goods. \"As the writer soon saw that any effort of his own, however reasonable, to lead the Governor to a different opinion was opening the way to suspicions against himself of some personal interest in the company's affairs, prudence naturally admonished him to desist. One morning, Mr. S. S. Phelps, to whom the Governor's belief \u2014 and propensity to express it \u2014 was no secret, being in Burlington, stepped into a place where the Governorhappened at the moment to be engaged in his favorite pastime of denouncingMr. Chouteau's establish- ment, etc., and the Governor, totally unacquainted with Mr. Phelps, still kept up in his presence his conversation on the subject. \" Now, if there was anything Capt. Billy Phelps loved better than another, it was to play off a trick ; or if anything he knew better than another, it was how to plan and play it. The company had on its license a man named Simp son Vassar, who was better known at the Agency and its various dependencies under the sobriquet of 'Suggs.' When any deviltry lurked in Capt. Billy's mind, ' Capt. Suggs ' was his most reliable assistant in getting rid of it. So a"], [352, "360 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. scheme was planned. Suggs was sent over on pretext of some message to Phelps, at Oquawka, with instructions not to leave Burlington until he had exe cuted his part of the programme. \" A person, who was either the City Marshal or attached to his official reti nue, soon heard of Suggs in Burlington, and became so ambitious of his acquaintance as to introduce himself without delay. He learned from Suggs that the latter lived out in the Agency neighborhood ; that he knew the Trading Company, in fact, sometimes worked for them when an extra force was needed \u2014 clever people ; good paymasters, with the cash always in hand ; knew noth ing of their dealing in whisky ; had never seen them supply it to the Indians ; and, even if he had, as he had heard they were accused of it, a dollar, when needed, was not so easily made out there that a man could afford to make ene mies out of good-paying employers ! After several interviews, Suggs embarked upon the ferry-boat. But his newly-made friend was not long in joining him, and during the crossing Suggs yielded to the potent arguments and promises that had already shaken his sense of personal honor and interest. He admit ted that he had seen a large lot of kegs, and these not empty, landed by night at the trading-house from a boat, not long before, and immediately buried upon the bank, where most of them were; and if he could be guaranteed against suspicion as the informer, and terms arranged to suit \u2014 as he expected to remain about the place some time after his return \u2014 he would put his friend upon the right track. The boat having landed them, and all details being ad justed, each party went on his way rejoicing \u2014 Suggs' way being to Oquawka, and at once back to the trading-house to report to Capt. Phelps. \" Not many days later, an hour or so before dinner time, Col. Jesse Will iams \u2014 later of Henn, Williams & Co., of Fairfield, but then Private Secretary to Gov. Lucas \u2014 rode up to the Agency. Being doubtless himself disposed (as indeed the Agency hospitality would suggest) to consider that an expedition which would demand a three-mile ride and several hours of time, could be more satisfactorily completed as a post-prandial duty, he made no mention of his business. But as soon as the meal was over, he handed to the Agent a pack age from the Governor, containing a deposition in full form, taken before Judge Mason, of the Territorial Supreme Court, by Suggs' Burlington friend, to the effect that so many kegs of whisky, etc., etc., and were then secreted, etc., etc., in violation of the statute, etc., by the said P. Chouteau Jr.'s Company, traders, etc., as aforesaid. And there was also a line to the Agent, that, in the execution of so delicate a duty, which must involve judicial process, he had deemed it best to send out Col. Williams to assist the Agent. Whatever the motive may have been, it is certain that until both were in their saddles, Col. Williams proved himself able to watch the Agent with untiring eye. \" Reaching the trading-house, the person who took the deposition and a companion were found there waiting, they having ' forked off ' by another trail so as not to be seen. Suggs was on hand, having taken the opportunity to post the Burlingtonians about the locality. And also Capt. Billy Phelps, called by the Indians Che-che-pe-qua, or the ' Winking Eyes,' was there, those visuals fairly gleaming with joy over the anticipated fun. \" The Agent proceeded at once to business, expressing to Capt. Phelps his regret that so unpleasant a duty should have devolved upon him ; his hope that it would prove that so serious a complaint had originated in some error, but sug gesting that, if true, admission of the fact and production of the contraband article would be more apt to temper subsequent proceedings with leniency than efforts to conceal it would do. The Captain vehemently denied the impeach-"], [353, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 361 i ment, stating that it would require a much wiser man than himself to discover where such an article then was, or ever had been kept upon their premises. The complainant was now appealed to, who led the party a short distance to a spot where, with a triumphant air, he pointed to an X that the edge of Suggs' boot sole had made in the sandy bank. \" They began digging, and soon reached some matting that was removed, and thus uncovered a lot of lard kegs, too greasy to suggest a thought of any other article being contained within them. The immediate ' sold, by thunder ! ' of one of the moiety gentlemen, and in accents too lugubrious to be listened to with out exciting a sense of sadness. Suggs, meanwhile, had come up missing, and the ' Winking Eyes ' walked off with a most disdainful air, leaving the Agent and his party on the spot, whence thev soon returned to the Agency, where the Agent made his report that the informer had pointed out a place, where, by digging, a large quantity of lard in kegs was found that had been buried to avoid loss by heat, and in the night to conceal the fact from vagabond whites and Indians. The disappointed informer and his companion hastened home ward ; but Col. Williams remained until next morning, and then returned, bear ing the Agent's report. \" But the unkindest cut of all was six months later, when, about the last of February, Capt. Phelps addressed a letter to Gov. Lucas in the most respectful and official form, saying, that having heard he had declared his determination not to continue in office under such an old Tory as Gen. Harrison, and fearful that whoever his successor would be, he might not feel so friendly toward the company as he had proved in the matter of exhuming their lard, and as they would soon be much in need of some, and the ground was then very hard frozen, the company would be under great obligations if he would at once send some one out to dig up the rest of it. \" Previous to the treaty of 1842, some few changes were made in their location, both by the Indians and among the whites. The house at the ' Old Garrison ' was broken up, and one established in its stead up in the Red Rock region, near the mouth of White Breast ; and Keokuk, also, moved his village into the same neighborhood.\" ORGANIZATION OF THE COUNTY. The successive steps of organization which led to the independent division of Van Buren as a county may be summarized thus : Originally, this vast area was included in the Louisiana Purchase, approved by Congress in 1803. In 1807, Iowa was included in the Territory of Illinois ; in 1812, in the Territory of Missouri ; in 1834, the Black Hawk Purchase having been made, all of the territory west of the Mississippi and north of the northern boundary of Mis souri was made a part of the Territory of Michigan. In September, 1834, the Legislature of Michigan established two precincts, or counties, in Iowa, as it is now called. These counties were Dubuque, including all territory north of a line drawn westward from the foot of Rock Island, and Des Moines, including all territory south of that dividing line. The Territory of Wisconsin was organized in 1836, and Iowa was a part of that political division. The third act of the first Legislature of the Territory of Wisconsin, which met in Octo ber, 1836, at Belmont, was an act dividing Des Moines County into Lee, Van Buren, Des Moines, Henry, Louisa and Muscatine Counties. The limits of Van Buren, then the most westerly district, were not defined on the west, but"], [354, "362 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. extended, as was the custom, to the farthest boundary of the territory possessed by the United States. Henry, Louisa and Muscatine Counties were each thus unbounded within lines drawn from their northern and southern extremities. Farmington was fixed upon as the county seat of Van Buren County. The Representatives from Southern Iowa at this Legislature were : Council, Jeremiah Smith, Joseph B. Teas and Arthur B. Ingram ; House, Isaac Leff ler, Thomas Bean, Warner L. Jenkins, John Box, George W. Teas, Eli Rey nolds and Daniel R. Chance. THE FIRST COURT. The first court was held at Farmington, beginning April 10, 1837, with Hon. David Irvin on the Bench. Henry G. Stewart was appointed Clerk, but was succeeded by Fry B. Hazletine, and he, in turn, by Elisha Cutter, Jr There was a grand jury, but no petit jury. The former was composed of the following men : Isham Keith, Foreman, Alexander Keith, Samuel Clayton, Elijah Purdon, Sr., John Whittaker, Joseph Hill, Charles H. Price, James Smart, Abington Johnson, Jonas F. Denny, William Jordon, Obediah Cook, William Judd, Thomas Summerlin, John Moffatt, A. V. Syhawk, J. G. Mc- Cutchen, William Brattain, Sr., Abel Galland, John Crow, Lewis Crow, Joseph A. Swazey and John Patchett. This grand jury found an indictment against one Doose, for exercising the office of Constable within our territory under the laws of Missouri ; and in this it is believed we have the first judicial assertion of jurisdiction over a territory afterward the theater of a most bloodless war, and yet fraught with the very greatest results and importance to this and every part of the State. Isaac J. Nowell, who was among the first, if not the first, settler on Indian Creek, was the officer who, as Sheriff, first opened our courts and arrested those violating the law. Isaac carried no sword or other insignia of office, but he had a well-tanned and closely-fitting suit of buckskin, which was quite as much a terror to all evil-doers and those not having the fear of the law before their eyes as the heaviest baton or loudest or most formal proclamation of \" God save the Court.\" He was succeeded by Henry Heffleman, and he by that acknowl edged prince of good men, Capt. J. H. Bonney \u2014 who still lives, believing in acting as he has through life, upon the elevating maxim that \" it is more blessed to give than receive.\" The second term was held at the same place, commencing April 14, 1838, and a petit jury impaneled to try a member of the first grand jury, who, at the first term, was indicted for house breaking. The members of this jury were Thomas L. Pickett, William Minear, Thomas Keith, B. F. Anderson, James Sanders, Leonard Whitcomb. William Williams, John Newport, Henry Hamp ton, Charles Graves, H. D. Swazey and Robert Ewing. The member of the legal profession who first settled in the county was H. H. Buckland. He was from New England \u2014 -settled in Bentonsport, and, after remaining a year or more, returned to his former home. Isaac N. Lewis, sub sequently a member of the Third Territorial Legislature (he was also a member of the Fifth), was the second. He was the first attorney admitted to practice (November 12, 1838) in the county. Following him and very soon were S.W. Summers, Richard Humphreys and Oliver Weld, who died in October, 1843. He was Judge Wright's partner at the time of his death. He was an honest man, and in his death the State lost a citizen of rare ability, the profession a sound lawyer, and society one of big heart, and, if eccentric, as able as eccentric."], [355, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 363 The record of the court held at Farmington shows that, in April, 1837, Samuel McBrice was granted a license to keep a ferry across the Des Moines, at that place, for one year. The first case of record was that of Simeon Rider (or Ryder) and Charles L. Frost, of Alton, 111., doing business as merchants, under the firm name of S. Rider & Co. vs. Achemiah Barber. Action for debt. Judgment for plain tiff for the sum of $2,232.50. There were four assault and battery, two gaming, one house-breaking, three debt and one attachment suits on the docket, and also a petition for prohibition. There were eight indictments and five suits commenced. The first petit jury was impaneled at the April term of court, 1838, and was composed of Henry King, John Maxwell, W. Job, Robert Kent, Lucius Lee, Uriel Neal, John Kennedy, Hiram Brown, William Matthews, John Browning, Martin A. Britton, Noah Franklin, William Welch, R. N. Cresap, H. D. Swazey, V. F. Jones, A. Mahnrou, R. Jordan, A. Galland and Jacob Crow. John Crow was naturalized at this term, the first foreigner to assume such relations in the county. He was a subject of Great Britain. FIRST MILITIA. By referring to the records of the Secretary of State, I find that on the 9th of January, 1830, Gen. E. A. M. Swazey was appointed Brigadier General of the First Brigade, First Division of the Territorial Militia. Many of you remember the times and scenes when, on the Utica Prairie, the General, with Col. Giles Wells, Maj. Henry King, Capt. Finess Killebrew, and other officers marshaled their forces, and had those remarkable and most imposing regimental trainings. On the 18th of the same month, the Governor appointed the following Jus tices of the Peace for the county : Wilson Stanley, Sewall Kenney, John Coch ran, Thomas J. Cox, David Tade, James Robb, Silas Stone, James Moffett, James E. Rickey, John Whittaker, John Groom, Robert Gardner, Benjamin B. Throop, Martin A. Britton, William Kendrick, Samuel C. Reed, George Reynolds, William Miller, Jesse Sutton, Alexander Woods, Joel Knight, David Casebar, John Marshall, Bushrod W. Cravens and John Taylor. FIRST RECORDS. The first Recorder was William Welch, and the first instrument of record in that office is a \" quitclaim \" deed, from William Clift, dated February 23, 1837, to Joseph A. Swazey and Vincent M. Jones, the consideration $350 \u2014 premises on Des Moines River, between the claims of E. A. M. and H. D. Swazey and T. A. Martin, as is inferred from subsequent knowledge of the parties, near Farmington ; but there is nothing in the deed to indicate definitely either the location or the size of the premises. This deed was filed for record March 20, 1837, and witnessed by E. A. M. Swazey and H. King. The oldest instru ment in date of record, however, is a bond from J. T. Holmes and Henry Bateman to John Crow, dated August 25, 1836, and filed for record November 6, 1837, for Lot 5, Block 3, Farmington. This was before the land sales ; for Farmington, it is proper to say, like many of the towns of the West, was laid out, lots sold, and improvements made long before the Government title was obtained. With faith in the Government, full of enterprise and \"goaheadative ness,\" with a spirit adventure and pluck, fortunes were made and lost on mere promises and hope; and thus the pioneers of this rich valley and the West gen-"], [356, "364 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. erally invited emigrants, and rapidly developed its resources. It will be found that the first warranty deed of record is for lots in Pittsburg, from Abiathar Buck, Williams and wife, and John Groom and wife, to Lemuel Mussetter, while the oldest deed of the kind is from David Taylor to Edward Nance, for twenty acres, in Section 32, Township 69, Range 8 (Harrisburg), dated Novem ber 22, 1838. Abram Foster made the first entry of land, his entry being October 2, 1838 (ninety-seven acres, in Section 6, Township 69, Range 10 \u2014 Van Buren), and he was followed on the 5th of October, 1838, by Robert J. Sturdivant, of 160 acres, in Section 35, Township 69, Range 8 \u2014 Harrisburg. During the same month (October, 1838), James F. Westcott entered the quarter section adjoining Keosauqua, which to this day is known as the West cott quarter. James Bell made his entry of his farm in Washington Township the same month. When he crossed the Des Moines River at Keosauqua, a few months before with his family, he borrowed money from Capt. James Hall to pay his ferriage, and he thus reached his claim without a cent in money, but with pluck and courage that carried him through. James N. McCutchen, Thomas Anson, Peter Gillis and Thomas Beer bought their lands in this township the same month. In Cedar Township, Samuel Huddleston ; in Union, John M. Whittaker ; in Farmington, Richard Cave, William Williams, James Rhodes, John New port ; in Vernon, Alexander Davis (whose wife hauled the rails with one horse to fence the improvement, while he split them), Nahum Sargent ; in Des Moines, Delaney Dillingham ; in Jackson, William and Jonathan McClure, William Brooks, Martin Tate, George Reynolds and John Cantrel ; in Village, Riley Gilbert and John D. Walker ; in Lick Creek, William S. Whittaker and Hiram Hill ; in Chequest, Stiles S. Carpenter, Sylvester Riley and Asheel Lane, made among the first entries. OFFICIAL ROSTER OF THE COUNTY.

David Irvin was the first to serve, in 1838. He appointed Henry G. Stewart as Clerk. Charles Mason succeeded Judge Irvin and served until 1847. Stewart acted as Clerk until the appointment of Frye B. Hazeltine. Elisha Cutler, Jr., also acted as Clerk. This ended the Territorial District Judgeship, and in the spring of 1847, Cyrus Olney was elected. He resigned in the spring of 1851, and Judge Joseph C. Knapp was appointed to fill the vacancy, which he did until the election of William H. Seevers in 1852. In the fall of 1856, Seevers resigned and Caleb Baldwin was appointed to fill the vacancy. In the spring of 1856, H. B. Hendershott was elected, and, owing to a change in the limits of the district, his term expired in the winter of 1859, when John S. Townsend became Judge of this district. The following, therefore, would be the roster from the beginning down to the present: 1838, David Irvin; 1839, Charles Mason; 1847, Cyrus Olney; 1851, Joseph C. Knapp ; 1852, William H.

Keith"], [360, "368 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. and Gen. Swazey to the first Council, both Whigs, while Bailey and Barker, in the House, were both Democrats, and their colleague, Hall, a Whig. It was in 1840 that our Democratic friends in the county were called upon to rally by that man of irrepressible and versatile genius, John Carnes, known then and somewhat since as ' Pious John ; ' and rally they did. An organization was effected, and soon those figuring lived to enjoy the fruits; and others, I remember, as, for instance, the so-called ' Union Year ' of 1842, when Bailey and Whittaker were defeated for the Council by Elbert and Jenkins; Bonney by Lyon, for Sheriff, to say nothing of others, who were occasionally led to realize that a dominant party is not always successful under the most vigorous party drill. That year of 1842, by the way, was about my first active recol lection of a political contest. It was peculiar, it will be remembered by the voters, some of whom I see here to-day, as having a so-called religious element in it. Dr. Bailey, Capt. Bonney, Ezra M. Jones, and their colleagues on the Democratic ticket, we hungry Whigs styled the infidel party. Many amusing incidents might be related. I remember one in connection with A. J. Davis, who was known as a most indefatigable worker in politics, as in everything else. While talking with John Workman, a Democrat and a Methodist, who lived on the place where ' Uncle ' Isaac Barker lived so long, Davis warned Barker of the danger to the cause of holiness if such infidels were elected, and finally concluded by saying that ' he'd be damned if our holy religion was not in danger if the Democrats succeeded.' \" REMINISCENCES. From the speech of Mr. A. H. McCrary, we quote the following descrip tion of the days of 1836 : When I first stood on the bank of the Des Moines River, in the fall of 1836, the spot where we are now assembled was covered with the foliage of forest-trees ; and down on the bank of the river, very near to where Mr. Manning's store is now situated, there were two or three small build ings being erected. Immediately above the then projected town was Father Purdom's cabin, and a few acres of ground cleared. Father Purdom's was a kind of headquarters and boarding-house for all who came along. The next cabin above was David Ely's, whose name that ford still bears. With Mr. Ely lived a brother-in-law, John Goodin. John was a fine, jovial young man, large and handsomely formed, and Father Purdom had some very excellent daughters. John was then very much like the young men are now, and while Father P. was very much opposed to young gentlemen decoying his daughters away from his humble cottage, John, not always having the fear of that good old gentleman before his eyes, wooed and gained the hand of Miss Purdom, and marriage-pledges were doubtless exchanged. But Father P., not having all the con fidence in John that was necessary to give his consent, therefore most positively refused, waxing wrathy. At this, John's ambition became somewhat aroused, and so began to plot treason against the old gentleman's rights, and, in order to carry out his treasonable purpose, he hired Aaron W. Harlan, the hero of the Des Moines, to assist him. Aaron was an Aaron of old. Mighty in words, and still more powerful in deeds, he procured an Indian canoe, and, just as the moon was showing her broad face in the east, it was quietly landed at a suitable landing, and, while the unsuspecting father was quietly reposing, naughty John and crafty Aaron were stealthily assisting Miss P. to get her necessary apparel and herself safely conveyed to the land ing. All safely on board, Aaron loosed the cable, and, there being no dams in the river (and the old gentleman being too pious to use any of the other kind), they glided smoothly down to the town of Sweet Home, in Missouri, where Esq. Beedle officiated, making the late Miss Pur dom Mrs. Goodin. Subsequently, other young gentlemen, being encouraged by John's success, made raids upon the old gentleman's household, until he was compelled to succumb and submit to an inglorious defeat. This old gentleman's cabin was one of the most public places in the county at that time. Besides its being the home of his family, it was used as public boarding house, church, and I am not sure but it was sometimes used as a Court House. While old Father Purdom may have had traits in his character peculiar to himself, he was one of God's noblemen, an honest man, and he has long since gone to his reward. In looking back to the early settling, I regard the winter of 1837-38 as the hardest times we ever endured. Crowds of people had located during the summer, and many were in very uncomfortable cabins when winter came on. Some had raised a little corn, but there were no"], [361, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 369 mills in the country nearer than Waterloo, Mo., to grind it, and a very severe winter upon us. For weeks, many of us subsisted on boiled corn or beat meal bread. That beating process could be endured for the sake of a change, but very soon we would fall back to hominy again. Those mortars, in which we would beat the corn into meal, were worked by hand, and were called \"Armstrong's mill.\" In some localities, horse-mills were erected. That class of machinery was only temporary, and I consider a description of them more tedious than profitable ; and yet they afforded a temporary relief, and were regarded an improvement on the beatingor hominy proc ess. About the year 1837, William Duncan commenced the erection of a mill on the Des Moines River, just where Kinnersly's mill now stand; and, about the same time, William Meek & Sons commenced building a mill at Bonaparte. Duncan threw out a wing-dam about half-way across the river, and constructed a singular kind of wheel, which was called a screw wheel, lbe rushing of the water through the wheel gave it motion, to which the machinery was attached. While its likeness was never seen before or since, yet, by wallowing in water, we were able to get our corn ground, and we were so highly elated that I believe some of us tried to send Mr. Duncan to the Legislature. But I believe we failed. From the speech of Mr. Edwin Manning we quote the following concise and admirable record of his experiences from 1837 : In the winter of 1837, I was sojourning in Missouri, and fell in with Capt. Hall, Fairman and Carnes, all looking for homes in the West. The Captain and myself engineered a jumper ride on the Des Moines River from St. Francisville to the rapids, in January, 1837 (now Mr. Kinnersly's famous water-power). How we were delighted, first with our ride up the river on the smooth ice, blanketed with pure snow, and next with the little water-fall that we imagined was an embryo fortune for some ingenious Yankee to develop into hydraulic powers. Hence the location of the county town here. But this was not all of our sight-seeing. Mr. Fairman and I made a trip across the half-breed tract to Fort Madison, and on our way we visited old Black Hawk in his camp, then located on Devil Creek, just below Fort Madison. I shall never forget the peculiar look and air of the old fallen chief. He received us kindly, but was extremely reticent, and would not encourage conversation to much extent. The country, at this time, was nearly all vacant, the settlements being confined to the streams. Claims had been made along and up the \" Demoin \" for nearly one hundred miles, or as far west as the first purchase reached. My first trade in Iowa was for a \"half-breed\" claim. This consisted of several hundred acres of land and some twenty-five town lots in Keokuk, costing me some $500. I then left the country, and returned in 1838, and attended the first land sale held in Burling ton, in November, 1838. In the spring of 1839, I opened out the best stock of goods in the val ley. I continued my business prosperously, and, in 1841, I contracted to supply the Government fort at the Raccoon Forks with provisions. This I did by chartering a steamboat at St. Louis and delivering my goods by steam. The upper country in and about Raccoon Forks was then peopled wholly by the red men. In honor of my bringing a boat from St. Louis, and giving the officers and Indian chiefs a free ride upon the river, Capt. Allen sent his couriers to the head men of the nation to come and pay their respects to us and give us a war-dance. This was done on a magnificent scale. Not less than three hundred of the best braves, Sacs and Foxes, assem bled and gave one of their best performances, with all their paraphernalia, bells, feathers and paint. Altogether, it was the greatest feat I had ever witnessed in my Western life, thus far. Soon after this, the fort was moved further west, and the Indians went to their new home south of the Missouri. In 1843, the country was opened up for white settlement on the new purchase, and great and rapid emigration commenced from all parts of the Western States, and many from the East. The navigation of the river was obstructed by occasional mill-dams, and the steamboat men of those days were too timid to risk their fortunes on the Des Moines to fight mill-dams. The next great era in enterprise in the valley was tiatboating, and in this particular vocation, per haps, your speaker was one of the most successful men in advancing and practically demonstrat ing the Des Moines River to be a natural channel for commerce. Other operators in the valley followed in quick pursuit, and soon the river navigation was fully appreciated. My peculiar forte was to build but few, but those were good and seaworthy crafts. In this I was successful, but nevertheless my fate was to sink one boat two times \u2014 first, at Bentonsport dam, and next at Croton \u2014 and finally got it into market and realized more money for it than it could have brought if it had reached the market without delay. The moral of this act teaches \"help yourselves, and good surely follows.\" Such was the experience of your speaker. Now, to give you another page of this history, transpiring at the same time, illustrates more fully the subject in question. My neighbor embarked in the same enterprise. He built cheap and frail boats, and hired men to run them, and out of a dozen or more started for market but one single craft lived through the voyage, and that was lost in damages. Thus, you see, what I inaugurated as a good enterprise my neighbor destroyed. This ended all flat boating on the beautiful Des Moines. Finally, the navigation was suspended until 1857. At this period, the valley had become rich in cereals, and a great demand came for navigation. It was not forgotten that, in 1841, Manning reached Raccoon Forks with a steamer, and hence why"], [362, "370 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. not again ? This was the cry, \" Out with the dams.\" This was the alarm sounded through the valley. Your speaker was not hard to understand what was most needed in the carrying-on of trade in the valley. Accordingly, he canvassed the matter with due consideration, and ventured upon another commercial enterprise. I proceeded to St. Louis, contracted with Capt. Allen at once to load the \" Jennie Lind \" and barge for Keosauqua and Eddyville. Arriving at Keokuk in due time, and having favorable water, my ambition was up to fever heat. But, to my utter astonishment, the Captain had learned through the skillful boatmen at Keokuk that they could not navigate the beautiful Des Moines. This brought dismay and trouble for a short time; but my perseverance and indomitable will-power to make the effort a success, if possible, overcame the embarrassment. The Captain was an old and good waterman. He became convinced that my heart was in the enterprise, and the more we argued the case the better he liked my logic. We became familiar boating companions for the trip, and finally we cast off the lines and set our face for the \"Diamond Navigation.\" Arriving at Farmington in a few hours, our steam and whistle made the village alive, and in a few minutes the whole town was on the bank of the river admiring the beautiful \" Jennie Lind.\" All was sunshine and glory to everybody except the mill-owners. Here again came the tug of war. It was fight or die. It would never do to stop here. The gates were closed, and apparently there was no entrance possible, being too old and weak to open ; hence the trouble. Finally, says I to Capt. Allen : \"I brought you here to do my work ; my order is that you at one* remove these gates, at my risk and expense, and go ahead. ' No sooner said than all hands laid hold and demolished the gates and sent them floating down stream. This brave act of Capt. Allen at an opportune time opened up commerce throughout the valley, and it was never closed until superseded by rail. In this little enterprise, I was more than compensated in my own limited business, and what it did for me it did for the whole valley. I did not stop to calculate its importance, nor did I realize it fully till its development almost overwhelmed us, of such value was commerce brought to our doors by this great natural channel. Our next great hope was the Des Moines improvement. In this we all expected to be enriched and made happy for the rest of our days. The great river grant was procured through Gen. Dodge, a veteran pioneer and popular politician in the State in those palmy days of Bour bon Democracy. With this munificent land grant for a great and good special object, the State accepted, but finally limited, and sailed to aid and foster the enterprise. The magnitude of the work contemplated State indorsement; failing to obtain this, the work languished, and was finally abandoned as being behind the age and progress of the times at that period. In approx imating its final adjustment with contracting parties, your speaker occupied a responsible posi tion, having been appointed by Gov. Grimes, and subsequently elected, Commissioner of the Improvement. I was let into the secret of fat internal improvement contracts. It was not unfashionable in those days to carry a good supply of old Bourbon, and when the wheels got slow to use a little for propelling power. It so happened, in one of my sittings, criticising the accounts of Improvement expenditures, we all become very jolly ; but it was a habit of mine not to sign papers without understanding their full import. This kind of sharp practice had been indulged in of occasionally asking a Commissioner to certify lands before they were fully paid for, and it was considered quite courteous to obtain an accommodation of this kind ; but I was always so slow to understand such things that they did not get my name as often as they wanted it to such papers. But in one grand levee we held over a settlement, the Company limbered up with Bourbon, and gave me the snug little sum of $75,000 discount on their regularly-entered charges against the State improvement. This was an eye-opener to all the people. The State at once proceeded to make a final settlement with the New Y'ork company. Subsequently, the remaining lands of the grant were negotiated for by the Valley Railroad. Thus ended the great farce of the first land grant to the Des Moines Valley. From the speech of Mr. Charles Baldwin, we quote: In coming to this new country, we came poor, most of us. We came to better our condi tion, to make homes which we were too poor to do in the older States. In making these homes, we hird to struggle with the hardships of a new country, as well as with poverty. With good luck, it took eight or ten days to get a load of provisions. The great river could only be crossed by row-boat. If the river or wind was high, the poor settler had to wait often for days before he could cross. In the mean time, the good wife and the little ones were alone, nestled in the little cabin behind some far-off point of timber, hourly, hungrily scanning the wide prairie a6 far as the eye could reach, anxiously looking for husband and father with something to eat. Brave wives, noble mothers ! right well have you earned your homes May you long live to enjoy them. Mark the contrast of to-day. Over the same routes we then traveled, we now send food for thousands upon thousands of hungry people. And we can go to Illinois and back in as many hours as it then took us days, crossing the great river on strong iron bridges that defy wind and waves, ice and floods. In the same time that it then took us to reach the banks of the iMississippi on Nature's roads, we can now reach the shores of the Atlantic Ocean on the one hand, or repose in the shade of the Rocky Mountains, capped with eternal snow, on the other."], [363, "<^e^\u20ac (deceased) 4"], [364, ""], [365, "373 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. In those days, too, we had a weekly mail, if the season and the roads were good, bringing us newspapers and letters from our friends. Perhaps they had been weeks on the way, but they were always fresh. For the coveted letters we had to pay 25 cents postage, and it was freely given. Now for 1 cent we send our letters to Maine or Georgia, or the far-off States of the Pacific ; and we are not satisfied unless we have mail twice a day. If impatient of this delay, we can, by the magic wire, talk with our friends thousands of miles away, almost as if we were face to face. Then it took two bushels and a half of corn to pay postage on one letter. Now for one bushel we can pay postage on fifty letters. Then it took six dozen of eggs to get a letter from mother or sister. Now we can get from ten to twenty for one dozen of eggs. When we remember that the usual time for our letters and papers to reach us was ten to thirty days, we can hardly realize the fact that the full proceedings of this meeting of Iowa Pioneers, to-day can be printed and read by the people of San Francisco, 2,000 miles away, before the sun goes down. My friends, your thoughts go back to-day to your old log cabins, claim-pens, as they were sometimes called. But little and mean as they looked, they held all that was dearest and brightest to you \u2014 your wives and little ones \u2014 while the bright halo of hope shed its rays around them, gilding, with its glory, the horizon of all your future. And I appeal to you, venerable pioneers, if in those little log cabins you did not spend the happiest days of your lives, the brightest hours of your existence. As I have before stated, immigration flowed into this county rapidly from 1836 to 1843. In 1838. the population of the county was about 3,000. In 1840, it was 6,140. In 1840, the New Purchase was opened to settlement, and many who had stopped in this border county only until they could get a chance to \"go West,\" moved on into the new country. The first assessment of property for taxation in the county, that I can find on record, was in 1839, on about $152,336 of property; and the tax collected was $873.83. In 1840, there were sixteen towns recorded in the county, and the town property was assessed at $59,550.50. Their names were Rising Sun, Rochester, Philadelphia, Birmingham. Harrisburg, Des Moines City, Watertown, Keosauqua, South Keosauqua, Hedvolant, Winchester, Farmington, New Lex ington, Columbus, North Bentonsport and South Bentonsport ; each town looking grandly on paper, and in the estimation of their sounders, the embryo of great cities; all blowing their trumpets and making a great noise in the world on an average capital of $3,722.22 each. The annual assessment of property shows our progress in wealth, while the National census shows our increase in population. But time will not permit a statement of the assess ment of each year. I will therefore take periods that sufficiently illustrate our advancement in wealth and population. In 1850, our population was 12,270, an increase of 100 per cent in ten years, 10 per cent per annum. Our property was assessed that year at $1,353,671. In 1860, our population was 17,081, an increase of about 40 per cent in ten years, or 4 per cent per annum. The assess ment that year was of farms, $2,811,859; of personal property, $964,661; of town property, $386,070; total, $3,662,590, showing an increase in ten years, of about 170 per cent, or 17 per cent per annum. In 1870, our population was 17,672, an increase in ten years of only 591, about of 1 per cent, only, in that time. The assessment for that year was: farms, $3,264,862; personal property, $1,623,387; towns, $552,304; total, $5,440,553 ; showing that, while from 1860 to 1870, our population increased only about I or' 1 per cent, our property increased in the same period about 50 per cent, or at the rate of 5 per cent per annum. For this year, 1875, the assessment is: farms, $3,327,543; personal property, $1,501,402 ; towns, $530,730; railroads, $261,890; total, $5,621,565. There are 65 miles of railway in the county. They were not assessed in 1870, nor at any time before that year. Showing that the assessed value of our property has increased in five years only $181,012, about 3J per cent in five years. Deduct the railroad property, and our other property has gone back in valuation since 1870, $90,878. To form a just idea of the progress we have made, we will take a view of the revenues of the county from time to time. As I have said, the taxes collected in 1839 were $873.83; in 1850, the levy was $10,581.70; in 1860, $26,996.32; in 1870, $78,717. About 1850, is, perhaps, the period when the increase of our population and the development of our county settled into something like a normal condition. It will be observed that the value of the property of the county has increased about ten times as fast as our population. This increase is almost entirely the result of the labor of its citizens. It will also be observed that the annual in crease in the value of property has not kept pace with the rate of interest upon money. And it will be further observed that the increase in direct taxes is about twice as great as the rate of property increase. alvah Clayton's address. From an address delivered by Mr. Alvah Clayton, of St. Louis, before the Pioneers' Association, in 1878, we take the following extract : The incidents of which I propose to speak are necessarily of a personal nature, and I must ask you to excuse the seeming egotism in mentioning them. My only motive is to illustrate to D"], [366, "374 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. the younger portion of this audience the trials, privations and self-sacrificing labors of the early settlers of this county, and to give them an insight into the state of society as it then existed. The experiences of our own family were no doubt very similar to those of the other pioneers. My father, leaving his family in the State of Ohio, came into this valley in the spring of 1836, and laid his claim, as I have before said, at the mouth of the Chequest Creek, just above the present village of Pittsburg. His claim embraced a frontage of half a mile on the river, and extended up the creek about a mile, and included what he regarded at the time as an excellent site for a water-mill ; and there he subsequently erected one of the first mills ever erected in this county. Alone and unaided, he built him a cabin on the bank of the river, and cleared off the timber and brush from five acres of the ground, preparatory to planting a crop of corn and other vegetables. By this time the season was well advanced. He had no team, except a poor old ox, which he had purchased of Mr. Peter Gillis, who had already settled a short distance below the site of the city, on the opposite side of the river. For this ox he made a single yoke, with ropes attached for traces. But, unfortunately, he had no agricultural implements \u2014 no plow, no har row, nor even a hoe. The nearest point where such articles could be secured was the then vill age of Quincy, 111. Thither he determined he would go, late as was the season. Taking his Indian canoe, which was his only means of transportation, he paddled his way to the mouth of the river, where he was fortunate enough to meet a steamboat, on which he took passage to Quincy. Procuring the irons for a plow, and other implements which he needed, he returned by steamer to the mouth of the Des Moines River, whose rapid current he ascended in his canoe, by the toil some process of paddling, poling and towing. Finally, after a wearisome voyage of many days, he reached home \u2014 hastily constructed a stock for his plow, hunted up his old ox, which had by this time become fat and strong from feeding upon the luxuriant grass of the rich bottom land, and was ready to commence plowing. But the middle of June had now arrived ; the grass and weeds had grown up nearly as high as the back of his ox, and all he had time to do was to run single furrows in which to plant his corn. He afterward plowed out the intervening spaces, and thus, by dint of hard work and perseverance, succeeded in raising a fine crop of corn. Mean while, he had written back to my brother, who was in charge of the family in Ohio (the brother who has been a resident in your midst during the last forty-two years), to bring the family on as soon as possible. This he hastened to do, making the long and tedious journey overland, through the black swamps of Indiana and the seemingly boundless prairies of Illinois. Crossing the Mississippi at what is now the city of Nauvoo, we made our way through the trackless prairies without seeing any signs of a white settlement until we arrived on the bank of the Des Moines, opposite my father's cabin, in the month of November, 1836, after a toilsome journey of five weeks. Then commenced our long and laborious struggle for a subsistence in this wild but fertile valley. The obstacles and discouragements were met and overcome, not without the sorest trials, both mental and physical. Of the luxuries of life, which you now enjoy so abundantly, we were wholly deprived. For a time, it was with the utmost difficulty that we could obtain even those things which now seem absolutely necessary. It is true, we never suffered for the want of food and clothing, though what we had was necessarily of the plainest and coarsest kind. At first the rifle supplied our table with meat, and for bread we were limited to corn and buckwheat. But even these we had no means of grinding. Forty miles away in Missouri was the nearest mill, and thither, occasionally, would my father and brother go with a wagon-load of corn to be ground into meal. When it was incon venient to make this long journey, we had to resort to the expedients of the tin \"grater,\" the woodin mortar and the coffee-mill. With the manner of using these implements many of you are doubtless familiar. At first the Indians were our most numerous neighbors. They were constantly passing up and down the river, sometimes on foot, but generally in canoes. They seldom passed our door without stopping to beg or steal \u2014 and you can readily imagine that their visits were not cordially welcomed. A few white people soon settled around us, and we hailed their coming with joy. To show you how gladly we welcomed new-comers, I will mention an incident which occurred in the spring of 1837 \u2014 the spring following our own arrival. In April, there arrived on the bank of the river opposite our residence, two large families from Illinois, both well provided with teams, wagons and stock cattle. They were to be our neighbors, and we rejoiced to see them. We assisted them in getting their teams and effects across the river by lashing two canoes together and placing planks across to form a platform. On this rudely and hastily constructed boat, all were safely ferried over. If I mistake not, each family consisted of ten persons, making twenty in all. They had come without any previous preparations for houses in which to dwell. Although our cabin con tained but one room, sixteen feet square, yet we took them all in, and sheltered them as best we could for about two weeks, until they had erected cabins for themselves, on claims they had pre viously selected not far from our own homestead. Just how we succeeded in accommodating so many people in so very small a space, I am utterly unable to tell you. I remember, however, that at night beds were spread all over the floor, under our bedsteads, and in the low attic overhead. Even these could not accommodate all, and a number of larger boys had to sleep in the wagons out-of-doors. At meal time, those who could not be accommodated at the first table had to wait for the second or third. This was rather a rough way of entertaining visitors, but it was the"], [367, "375 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. best we could do under the circumstances, and it is but just that I should say that our guests accepted the rude hospitality we had to offer with thankful hearts. And now, it would hardly be proper for me to close this narrative without saying that these two families bore the honored names of Duffield and Swearingen. The heads of these families, with the exception of the aged Mrs. Duffield, have long since been called to their last reward ; but they have left behind them a numerous progeny, many of whom are now respected and influential citizens among you. I might detain you a long time by the recital of interesting incidents connected with early times in this county : but. lest I weary you, I will ask your attention only a few minutes longer. At the early date at which my father arrived here, this territory was nominally under civil jurisdiction of the Territory of Michigan ; but no courts had been established, or officers appointed to execute the laws. Practically, we had no laws except such rules as the settlers found it necessary to establish for their own protection. Every man was, to a limited extent, a law unto himself, and was not molested in the exercise of his own free will, unless he infringed upon the rights of his neighbors. Hence, many things were done which would hardly be con sidered proper in the present advanced state of society. To illustrate, I will mention one inci dent, and then I will close. There lived in our neighborhood a man having a wife and two children \u2014 a boy and a girl. There was another lady, somewhat advanced in years, who had been a member of his family for some considerable length of time. He also had in his employment an unmarried man, on the shady side of thirty. It happened that the husband and wife did not dwell together as harmoni ously as husband and wife ought to. Just what was the cause of the trouble I never knew ; but in order to settle the difficulty, a mutual agreement was entered into of the following nature : The husband transferred his wife to his hired man, and himself took the other woman for a wife. As the arrangement was agreeable to the ladies, all parties were satisfied. The mother took the daughter and the father retained the son. There was also some agreement as to the division of property; and to give the whole transaction a show of legality, some neighbors were called in to witness the contract. judge wright's peroration. The address referred to in the foregoing pages, delivered by Judge Wright, was concluded with the following personal mention, which is too valuable to be omitted : 1 have purposely omitted any reference to Keosauqua and its settlement, for the reason that I told what I knew on that subject in an address before its Library Association, March 4, 1856, and as the collection and preservation of facts connected with the early settlement of the county is one object of the Association, that being published can be used, and I have hence for the most part devoted my attention to other localities. To other towns and neighborhoods and individuals I should with pleasure have referred, if I had been successful in gathering the material, or if time permitted. Indeed, I feel that I am not to be excused for passing over many others. Thus I would like to refer at length to my early and warm friend, Isaac N. Lewis, who had so much to do with laying the foundations ; who struggled with the rest of us amid the trials of a frontier life ; and who, to use his own energetic method of profanity, \"by gum!\" could do anything else but drink whisky with the best of us. And he that, with the rest of us, Isaac was accustomed to call his competitor, now Col. Summers, who it were hard to tell whether he loved congenial com pany, a fine horse or a big fee best. And to Uncle Jonuy Seaman* (I wonder if he rides a \"blue buck\" yet?). And to Uncle Tommy Beer, honest, quaint and ever inoffensive. And that other Uncle Tommy (Hearn), loving Maryland first and Iowa last and best. And Uncle Ira Claflin, from the Land of Steady Habits, and whose habits are always steady, with his good wife with her good black eyes; and once again to Capt. Josiah Bonney, with his big heart, and by his side Orpha, whom he found at Rochester when he and I were young \u2014 once more afflicting Father Stannard with a Democratic son-in-law ; and George W. Games, and Eliza, too, who were the life of the social circle years long gone, but now, alas ! the \" weight of years,\" just a little, is upon them ; and John, of the tribe of Goodall \u2014 good old Kentucky stock \u2014 among our best and truest citizens \u2014 most of them \"across the River\" now, the Great River \u2014 but those remaining, as were those gone, worthy and respected by all ; and that enthusiastic friend and Whig, his brother-in law, Isaac W. McManaman, who did nothing by halves, and whether at home or in a political con vention, or the Legislature, by his very earnestness and whole-souled manner, won the esteem and respect of all ; and up the Des Moines, just below Iowaville, that man of positive character and Baptist proclivities. Benjamin Saylor, and his long line of boys, John, Conrad, Hiram, Jehu, and perhaps a dozen others, who made big farms in this and Polk County, and who, by his force of character, commanded attention in all circles. And again, the long line from near Posey County, Ind. \u2014 they of the tribe of McCrary \u2014 James and Abner and John C, and their relatives and descendants \u2014 for have they not given us Esquires, and Senators, and Representatives, and Sheriffs, and M.

Cresap, with that wife who has accomplished more and with more life and good-humor than any one that lives\u2014 he I should not forget ; for whether in Louisiana or Texas, wherever thrown by fate or fortune, he still turned to the same beautiful and rich land where he now lives as the brightest and most pleasant spot on earth : and then, there is Harvey \u2014 of the long tribe of Alexanders \u2014 irrepressible in his politics, endless in his story-telling, never exaggerating in the least, whether on the block or off, aud is still going, going, going, and will be till he's gone : and my old friend Robert forties, who never had but a \"mere whang of apples,\" which meant more than all his neighbors, and who never let any poor Whig or Radical rest if he could get a chance to punch him in the ribs ; and those pioneers of large personal, political and social influence, Capts. Hancock and Sanford; and that blessed good man, Sheriff Johnson, with his son-in-law, McPherrin \u2014 twice a member of the General Assembly \u2014 and of whom to say that he is as good and honest as the father-in-law, is but simple truth and no faint praise ; and that fine specimen of manhood and old-fashioned Methodism, Uncle Johnny Spencer and his good and solid neighbors, Groom and Warren; and that jolly Democrat from Delaware, Billy Holland, and his equally jolly neighbor, Onias Hale, and scores of others in the same vicinity, from the land of Rush, in the much-abused State of Indiana; and then, too, he that was among our earliest and truest men, Mark C. Thatcher, of Quaker stock, and that quiet wife of his, and their boys almost num berless, Jonathan, Isaac, Thomas, Aaron, Amos, Ezekiel, and how many more I cannot tell; and his old neighbors, whose influence was fully equal to any others in their vicinity, Lippincott, and Muir, and Burns; and Ralph, of the house of Peterson, than whom no county ever had truer men ; and of course Dr. Nathan Shepherd, always fighting for the right and peddling pills ; while James, of the same name, dealt in politics ; and Benjamin F.

Joseph), who started in the woods, but woods no longer, and who has more children to love than any man in the county, for he beats Dr. Sturdivant, having, as I am told, eighteen, the Doctor only fourteen ; and Joel and Wesley Walker, from the land of Penn, who have had as much to do with Keosauqua and its growth as most others, perhaps any, unless it be one I should not forget, Edwin Manning, of the strong frame and marked face, rather slow of speech and movement, and yet never idle, and who holds the largest purse and more lands than any other, save his friendly rival, Seth, of the land of Bentonsport, both of them still New Englanders somewhat in manners and habits, notwithstanding their many days in the West; and the neigh bor of Seth, Dr. Cowles, recognized among the best physicians of the early days, and, perhaps, still so ; and Timothy, whose other name is Day, that never tires, with energy and good sense enough to govern a nation, and who has added more to the (stock i wealth of the county than all others; and Harvey Robb, who goes (or did) to <New Y'ork, Albany, Chicago and Philadelphia, with more cattle and hogs than any man in the county, and who, if not the handsomest man, is as good and energetic as many claiming better looks.

Yeager, whom I met at Father Purdom's, as I remember, the first meet- ing I ever attended in this place, November 15, 1840, who still lives to love his Church and to be respected by all ; and those physicians of quick movement and great practical sense in their pro- fession, Ober and Barton ; and the brother of the latter, William H. Barton, and his long-tried friend and associate, William B. Willes, who, like all of us, is getting old, but who believes, as we should, in driving dull care away ; and that pioneer Abolitionist, Charles Gardner, at Business Corner, who was as fearless in the defense of his principles as he was straightforward in his business habits ; and his near neighbor, Riley, who has gone to the old brick structure (Mt.

I say, to these and scores of others whose names, faces and deeds come trooping into my mind, I should like so much to refer ; but you know and I know I cannot, for I must hasten on to that conclusion which I am sure you think I should have reached long since. And with a few more words you shall have it. I have been frequently asked, as you have, doubtless, why Van Buren County has not increased more rapidly in population. I will give you one or two reasons. It is certainly not because the location is undesirable, nor yet because the soil is not fertile. But, in the first place, there is no large town or city in the county. It is emphatically an agricultural county. And, in the next place, it is a noticeable fact that it filled up very rapidly at its first settlement. Thus, in 1838, it was the second county in population, having 3,174, Des Moines being first, and Van Buren being in advance of Lee or Dubuque. In 1840. it had the largest population, 6,166, Lee being next and Des Moines third. In 1844, it was third, having then over 9,000. Other counties just as large did not fill up so rapidly at first ; and hence the subsequent years show a greater relative increase. This county, it will also be remembered, was the seat of empire \u2014 the capital, so to speak, for several years, of the far-famed Des Moines Valley or Republic. Until the new settlements west of us opened up, it was the place sought for by those coming into the Territories. Then most emigrants wanted to get as far south as possible, and this was the \" Eldo- rado.\" In course of time we had a country west and north, the notions of people as to climate changed, and this county did not, therefore, get the same proportion as at first of emigrants, nor could it retain, of course, all those here ; and while the growth has been healthy, and the advance in wealth very satisfactory, there was no room or chance for that marked increase as in other counties where the settlements were at first sparse.. And yet, if you leave out the large cities in the old counties, such as Keokuk, Burlington, Davenport and Dubuque, you will find that this county has kept pace with any other. However this may be, it is a matter of congratulation that few counties, if any, have been better managed in their finances, or had better officers. While it may not have as many miles of *Died at her residence in Keosauqua, May 6, 1873."], [370, "378 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. railway, or endeavored by township taxation and county bonds to build railroads, neither has it as many outstanding bonds nor as many masters as some others. It may not have as expensive public buildings, nor manifest as much so-called public spirit in its improvements ; yet it is a matter of pride that it had the first organized County Agricultural Society, dating back to 1841 ; that the county is surpassed by few in the natural advantages of coal, stone, water and rich lands, and has never been afflicted with defaulting public officers, never been compelled to hawk its securities in the market to raise revenue, seldom have its warrants been below par, and, as far as I know, never a dollar lost by an officer's dishonesty. Its schools and churches have con stantly increased in number, and I doubt whether any county responded more promptly or nobly to the call of the country for the defense of the flag, or was more generous or liberal in caring for the soldier's family and children while he was in the field or after he fell in maintain ing the nation's honor and unity. It has performed no small part in the history of the State. THE DISTINGUISHED MEN OF VAN BUREN. No county in the State has sent out a greater number of noted men than has Van Buren.

In addition to the above list there are seventeen editors, nine ministers, five lawyers, and an endless number of active, leading men in various parts of the country claiming birth or residence at one time in Van Buren County. HOW PIONEERS LIVED. In choosing his home the pioneer usually had an eye mainly to its location, and for that reason settlers were oftener than not very solitary creatures, with out neighbors and remote from even the common conveniences of life. A desir able region was sure to have plenty of inhabitants in time, but it was the advance guard that suffered the privation of isolation. People within a score of miles of each other were neighbors, and the natural social tendencies of man kind asserted themselves even in the wilderness by efforts to keep up communi cation with even these remote families. The first business of a settler on reaching the place where he intended to fix his residence, was to select his claim and mark it off as nearly as he could without a compass. This was done by stepping and staking or blazing the lines as he went. The absence of section lines rendered it necessary to take the sun at noon and at evening as a guide by which to run these claim lines. So many steps each way counted three hundred and twenty acres, more or less, the then legal area of a claim. It may be readily supposed that these lines were far"], [372, "380 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. from correct, but they answered all necessary claim purposes, for it was under stood among the settlers that when the lands came to be surveyed and entered, all inequalities should be righted. Thus, isa surveyed line should happen to run between adjoining claims, cutting off more or less of the other, the fraction was to be added to whichever lot required equalizing, yet without robbing the one from which it was taken, for an equal amount would be added to it in another place. The next important business was to build a house. Uutil this was done, some had to camp on the ground or live in their wagons, perhaps the only shel ter they had known for weeks. So the prospect for a house, which was also to be home, was one that gave courage to the rough toil, and added a zest to the heavy labors. The style of the home entered very little into their thoughts \u2014 it was shelter they wanted, and protection from stress of weather and wearing exposures. The poor settler had neither the money nor the mechanical appli ances for building himself a house. He was content, in most instances, to have a mere cabin or hut. Some of the most primitive constructions of this kind were half-faced, or as they were sometimes called \" cat-faced \" sheds or \" wike ups,\" the Indian term for house or tent. It is true, a claim cabin was a little more in the shape of a human habitation, made, as it was, of round logs light enough for two or three men to lay up, about fourteen feet square \u2014 perhaps a little larger or smaller \u2014 roofed with bark or clapboards, and sometimes with the sods of the prairie ; and floored with puncheons (logs split once in two, and the flat sides laid up), or with earth. For a fire-place, a wall of stone and earth \u2014 frequently the latter only, when stone was not convenient \u2014 was made in the best practicable shape for the purpose, in an opening in one end of the build ing, extending outward, and planked on the outside by bolts of wood notched together to stay it. Frequently a fire-place of this kind was made so capa cious as to occupy nearly the whole width of the house. In cold weather, when a great deal of fuel was needed to keep the atmosphere above freezing point \u2014 for this wide-mouthed fire-place was a huge ventilator \u2014 large logs were piled into this yawning space. To protect the crumbling back wall against the effects of fire, two back logs were placed against it, one upon the other. Some times these back logs were so large that they could not be got in in any other way than to hitch a horse to them, drive him in at one door, unfasten the log before the fire place, from whence it was put in proper position, and then drive him out at the other door. For a chimney, any contrivance that would conduct the smoke up the chimney would do. Some were made of sods, plastered upon the inside with clay ; others \u2014 the more common, perhaps \u2014 were of the kind we occasionally see in use now, clay and sticks, or \"cat in clay,\" as they were sometimes called. Imagine of a winter's night, when the storm was having its own wild way over this almost uninhabited land, and when the wind was roar ing like a cataract of cold over the broad wilderness, and the settler had to do his best to keep warm, what a royal fire this double-back-logged and well-filled fire-place would hold ! It must have been a cozy place to smoke, provided the settler had any tobacco ; or for the wife to sit knitting before, provided she had needles and yarn. At any rate it must have given something of cheer to the conversation, which very likely was upon the home and friends they had left be hind when they started out on this bold venture of seeking fortunes in a new land. For doors and windows, the most simple contrivances that would serve the purposes were brought into requisition. The door was not always immediately provided with a shutter, and a blanket often did duty in guarding the entrance. But as soon as convenient, some boards were split and put together, hung upon wooden hinges, and held shut by a wooden pin inserted in an auger hole. As"], [373, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 381 substitute for window glass, greased paper, pasted over sticks crossed in the shape of a sash, was sometimes used. This admitted the light and excluded the air, but of course lacked transparency. In regard to the furniture of such a cabin, of course it varied in proportion to the ingenuity of its occupants, unless it was where settlers brought with them their old household supply, which, owing to the distance most of them had come, was very seldom. It was easy enough to improvise tables and chairs ; the for mer could be made of split logs \u2014 and there were instances where the door would be taken from its hinges and used at meals, after which it would be rehung \u2014 and the latter were designed after the three-legged stool pattern, or benches served their purpose. A bedstead was a very important item in the domestic comfort of the family, and this was the fashion of improvising them : A forked stake was driven into the ground diagonally from the corner of the room, and at a proper distance, upon which poles reaching from each wall were laid. The wall ends of the poles either rested in the openings between the logs or were driven into auger holes. Barks or boards were used as a substitute for cords. Upon this the tidy housewife spread her straw tick, and if she had a home-made feather bed, she piled it up into a luxurious mound and covered it with her whitest drapery. Some sheets hung behind it, for tapestry, added to the cozi ness of the resting-place. This was generally called a \" prairie bedstead,\" and by some the \" prairie rascal.\" In design it is surely quite equal to the famous Eastlake models, being about as primitive and severe, in an artistic sense, as one could wish. The house thus far along, it was left to the deft devices of the wife to com plete its comforts, and the father of the family was free to superintend out-of door affairs. If it was in season, his first important duty was to prepare some ground for planting, and to plant what he could. This was generally done in the edge of the timber, where most of the very earliest settlers located. Here the sod was easily broken, not requiring the heavy teams and plows needed to break the prairie sod. Moreover, the nearness to timber offered greater conven iences for fuel and building. And still another reason for this was, that the groves afforded protection from the terrible conflagrations that occasionally swept across the prairies. Though they passed through the patches of timber, yet it was not with the same destructive force with which they rushed over the prairies. Yet by these fires much of the young timber was killed from time to time, and the forests kept thin and shrubless. The first year's farming consisted mainly of a \" truck patch,\" planted in corn, potatoes, turnips, etc. Generally, the first year's crop fell far short of supplying even the most rigid economy of food. Many of the settlers brought with them small stores of such things as seemed indispensable to frugal living, such as flour, bacon, coffee and tea. But these supplies were not inexhaustible, and once used, were not easily replaced. A long winter must come and go before another crop could be raised. If game was plentiful, it helped to eke out their limited supplies. But even when corn was plentiful, the preparation of it was the next diffi culty in the way. The mills for grinding it were at such long distances that every other device was resorted to for reducing it to meal. Some grated it on an implement made by punching small holes through a piece of tin or sheet iron, and fastening it upon a board in concave shape, with the rough side out. Upon this the ear was rubbed to produce the meal. But grating could not be done when the corn became so dry as to shell off when rubbed. Some used a coffee-mill for grinding it. And a very common substitute for bread was"], [374, "382 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. hominy, a palatable and wholesome diet, made by boiling corn in weak lye till the hull or bran peels off, after which it was well washed, to cleanse it of the lye. It was then boiled again to soften it, when it was ready for use as occa sion required, by frying and seasoning it to the taste. Another mode of preparing hominy was by pestling. A mortar was made by burning a bowl-shaped cavity in the even end of an upright block of wood. After thoroughly clearing it of the charcoal, the corn could be put in, hot water turned upon it, when it was subjected to a severe pestling by a club of sufficient length and thickness, in the large end of which was inserted an iron wedge, banded to keep it there. The hot water would soften the corn and loosen the hull, while the pestle would crush it. When breadstuff's were needed, they had to be obtained from long distances. Owing to the lack of proper means for threshing and cleaning wheat, it was more or less mixed with foreign substances, such as smut, dirt and oats. And as the time may come when the settlers' methods of threshing and cleaning may be forgotten, it may be well to preserve a brief account of them here. The plan was to clean off a space of ground of sufficient size, and if the earth was dry, to dampen it and beat it so as to render it somewhat compact. Then the sheaves were unbound and spread in a circle, so that the heads would be uppermost, leaving room in the center for the person whose business it was to stir and turn the straw in the process of threshing. Then as many horses or oxen were brought as could conveniently swing round the circle, and these were kept moving until the wheat was well trodden out. After several \"'floorings \" or layers were threshed the straw was carefully raked off, and the wheat shoveled into a heap to be cleaned. This cleaning was sometimes done by waving a sheet up and down to fan out the chaff as the grain was dropped before it ; but this trouble was frequently obviated when the strong winds of autumn were all that was needed to blow out the chaff from the grain. This mode of preparing the grain for flouring was so imperfect that it is not to be wondered at that a considerable amount of black soil got mixed with it, and unavoidably got into the bread. This, with the addition of smut, often rendered it so dark as to have less the appearance of bread than of mud ; yet upon such diet, the people were compelled to subsist for want of a better. Not the least among the pioneers' tribulations, during the first few years of settlement, was the going to mill. The slow mode of travel by ox-teams was made still slower by the almost total absence of roads and bridges, while such a thing as a ferry was hardly even dreamed of. The distance to be traversed was often as far as sixty or ninety miles. In dry weather, common sloughs and creeks offered little impediment to the teamsters ; but during floods, and the breaking-up of winter, they proved exceedingly troublesome and dangerous. To get stuck in a slough, and thus be delayed for many hours, was no uncom mon occurrence, and that, too, when time was an item of grave import to the comfort and sometimes even to the lives of the settlers' families. Often, a swollen stream would blockade the way, seeming to threaten destruction to whoever should attempt to ford it. With regard to roads, there was nothing of the kind worthy of the name. Indian trails were common, but they were unfit to travel on with vehicles. They are described as mere paths about two feet wide ; all that was required to accommodate the single-file manner of Indian traveling. An interesting theory respecting the origin of the routes now pursued by many of our public highways is given in a speech by Thomas Benton many"], [375, "383 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. years ago. He says the buffaloes were the first road engineers, and the paths trodden by them were, as a matter of convenience, followed by the Indians, and lastly by the whites, with such improvements and changes as were found neces sary for civilized modes of travel. It is but reasonable to suppose that the buffaloes would instinctively choose the most practicable routes and fords in their migrations from one pasture to another. Then, the Indians following, possessed of about the same instinct as the buffaloes, strove to make no improve ments, and were finally driven from the track by those who would. When the early settlers were compelled to make those long and difficult trips to mill, if the country was prairie over which they passed, they found it com paratively easy to do in summer, when grass was plentiful. By traveling until night, and then camping out to feed the teams, they got along without much difficulty. But in winter, such a journey was attended with no little danger. The utmost economy of time was, of course, necessary. When the goal was reached, after a week or more of toilsome travel, with many exposures and risks, and the poor man was impatient to immediately return with the desired staff of life, he was often shocked and disheartened with the information that his turn would come in a week. Then he must look about for some means to pay expenses, and he was lucky who could find some employment by the day or job. Then, when his turn came, he had to be on hand to bolt his own flour, as in those days, the bolting machine was not an attached part of the other mill machinery. This done, the anxious soul was ready to en dure the trials of a return trip, his heart more or less concerned about the affairs of home. These milling trips often occupied from three weeks to more than a month each, and were attended with an expense, in one way or another, that rendered the cost of breadstuff's extremely high. If mads in the winter, when more or less grain feed was required for the team, the load would be found to be so con siderably reduced on reaching home that the cost of what was left, adding other expenses, would make their grain reach the high cost figure of from three to five dollars per bushel. And these trips could not always be made at the most favorable season for traveling. In spring and summer, so much time could hardly be spared from other essential labor ; yet, for a large family it was almost impossible to avoid making three or four trips during the year. Among other things calculated to annoy and distress the pioneer, was the prevalence of wild beasts of prey, the most numerous and troublesome of which was the wolf. While it was true in a figurative sense that it required the ut most care and exertion to \"keep the wolf from the door,\" it was almost as true in a literal sense. There were two species of these animals \u2014 the large, black timber wolf, and the smaller gray wolf, that usually inhabited the prairie. At first, it was next to impossible for a settler to keep small stock of any kind that would serve as a prey to these ravenous beasts. Sheep were not deemed safe property until years after, when their enemies were supposed to be nearly exterminated. Large numbers of wolves were destroyed during the early years of settlement \u2014 as many as fifty in a day in a regular wolf-hunt. When they were hungry, which was not uncommon, particularly during the winter, they were too indis creet for their own safety, and would often approach within easy shot of the settlers' dwellings. At certain seasons, their wild, plaintive yelp or bark could be heard in all directions, at all hours of the night, creating in tense excitement among the dogs, whose howling would add to the dismal melody."], [376, "384 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. It has been found, by experiment, that but one of the canine species, the hound, has both the fleetness and courage to cope with his savage cousin, the wolf. Attempts were often made to capture him with the common cur ; but this animal, as a rule, proved himself wholly unreliable for such a service. So long as the wolf would run, the cur would follow ; but the wolf, being appar ently acquainted with the character of his pursuer, would either turn and place himself in a combative attitude, or else act upon the principle that \"discretion is the better part of valor,\" and throw himself upon his back, in token of sur render. This strategic performance would make instant peace between these two scions of the same house ; and not infrequeutly, dogs and wolves have been seen playing together like puppies. But the hound was never known to recog nize a flag of truce ; his baying seemed to signify \" no quarter,\" or at least so the terrified wolf understood it. Smaller animals, such as panthers, lynxes, wildcats, catamounts and pole cats, were also sufficiently numerous to be troublesome. And an exceeding source of annyoance were the swarms of mosquitoes which aggravated the trials of the settlers in the most exasperating degree. Persons have been driven from the labors of the field by their unmerciful assaults. THE COUNTY SEAT QUESTION. Farmington had numerous rivals for the honor of being the county seat. For two years, or thereabouts, the archives were retained where placed by the orig inal act ; but soon an effort was made in behalf of Rochester, Keosauqua and other points. The Legislature did pass a bill selecting Rochester as the future seat, but the Governor refused to approve of the act. Finally, the contest was ended by the adoption and approval of the following bill, in January, 1839 : An Act to relocate the County Seat of Van Buren County, and for other purposes. Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, That Benjamin F. Chastain, of Jefferson County, Michael H. Walker, of Lee County, and Stephen Gearheart, of Des Moines County, be and they are hereby appointed Commissioners to relocate the county seat of Van Buren County, whose duty it shall be to meet (or a majority of them) at the town of Keosauqua, in said county, on the first Monday ot May next, and proceed forthwith to locate a suitable place for the seat of justice of said county, having reference to the geographical center, convenience and welfare of said county. Sec. 2. The Commissioners, or a majority of them, shall, within ten days after their meet ing at the aforesaid place, make out and certify to the Clerk of the County Commissioners of Van Buren, under their hands and seals, a certificate containing a particular description of the situation of the location selected for the aforesaid county seat, together with the deed or deeds of any grant of land or lands, or bond or bonds for the payment us money, that may have been made by any individual or individuals for the benefit of the county. Sec. 3. The Commissioners aforesaid shall, before they enter upon their duties, severally take and subscribe an oath before some person legally authorized to administer the same, viz. : \" I, A. B., do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I am not, either directly or indirectly, interested in the location of the seat of justice of Van Buren County, nor do I own any property in lands or claims within the said county of Van Buren. So help me God.\" Sec. 4. If it shall be shown at any time within one year that the said Commissioners, or any of them, received any present, gratuity, fee or reward, in any form other than that allowed by law, or, before the expiration of six months from the time said location was made, becomes interested in said town, or in any lands in its immediate vicinity, the Commissioner or Commis sioners shall, upon conviction thereof, by indictment in the District Court of the county in which he or they may reside, be guilty of a high misdemeanor, and he forever after disqualified to vote at any election, or of holding any office of profit or trust within this Territory. Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the Commissioners aforesaid to receive, in the name of the Board of County Commissioners for the county of Van Buren, for the use of the county, any bond for the payment of money, or deed of land that may be made by any individual or indi viduals for the purpose of building public buildings at, the said seat of justice. And they shall receive the sum of $3.00 a day for their services during the time they may be necessarily employed in making said location ; and also the sum of $3.00 for every twenty miles, going from and returning to their respective homes."], [377, "385 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Sec. 6. The District Court of the county of Van Buren shall be held, for the first term after the passage of this act. at the town of Keosauqua, but forever thereafter at the place selected as the seat of justice for said county by the provisions of this act. Sec. 7. The Commissioners created by this act shall receive pay for their services upon a presentation of a certificate to the County Commissioners of their services, signed by said Commissioners, out of any money in the County Treasury not otherwise appropriated. Sec. 8. Be it further enacted. That the proprietors of the town of Keosauqua shall, on or before the 1st day of April next, enter into good and sufficient bonds, with security to be approved of by the County Commissioners, to the County Treasurer, for the benefit of the said county, for the sum of $5,000, payable in town lots in the said town of Keosauqua, or other real estate, at a fair cash value, or cash, or such other materials as the County Commissioners may deem proper to receive, for the purpose of carrying on or completing the public buildings in said county. Sec. 9. The payments to be divided into three equal parts, and paid annually in one, two and three years. Sec 10. Be it further enacted. That if the said proprietors shall enter into bonds, as pro vided for in the eigthth section of this act, then this act to be null and void, otherwise to remain in full force and value. Approved January 25, 1839. The terms of the bill were complied with, and Keosauqua became and has ever since remained the seat of justice. Substantial county buildings were erected in 1839-40, as is shown by the abstract of the proceedings of the Board of Commissioners given elsewhere. The apparent conflict of dates between the approval of the bill locating the seat at Keosauqua and the records of the Board, is explainable on the ground that the Board knew of the n;.ture of the bill, and acted rather in anticipation of its approval by the Governor. It is a well-known fact that all bills are not signed immediately, through a pressure of business, but sometimes lie for days awaiting executive action, of which they are certain. The vote of the people had decided the question of location in 1838, and the passage of the bill was but a formality. Hence, when we read that the Board met at Keosauqua Jan uary 7, 1839, while the bill was not approved until the 25th of that month, the inference is that the Board acted advisedly in anticipation of the Governor's approval. THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS. The first Board of Commissioners met in Farmington. It was composed of the following members : John Bending, Isham Keith and Enoch P. Blackburn. The first session was held May 4, 1837. The first work done was to elect the following officers : Recorder, William Welch ; Clerk, Enoch P. Blackburn ; Collector, Isaac J. Nowell ; Coroner, Roger N. Cresap ; Assessors, Giles O. Sullivan, William Nelson, William Judd ; Road Commissioners, Sanford Burling ham, James Hall, Truelove Sparks ; Overseers of the Poor, Asbil Van Sivauk Robert McElhany ; Fence Viewers, John Newport, Charles Davis, William Duncan ; Poundmaster, Robert W. Magruder. On June 17, 1838, the Board allowed \" Lewis Alfrey $6 for guarding Isaac Hendershott while a prisoner,\" for the alleged murder of Nathaniel Knapp. Among the records of the Supervisors is the following quaint piece of work bearing date of entry April, 1838. The ill-spelling and capitalization are as per copy : Kentucky, Ciieistain County. At the Solem Call of the Baptist Church of Christ, Sinking Fork of Little River we have set apart and ordained our Beloved Brother William Bradley By the imposition of hand to Preach the Gospel and to administer the ordinancis agreeable to the Word of God Wherever his Lot is Cast. Oct. 22, 1801. FIELDING WOLF MICAJAH B. ROWLANG\u2014 Presbatry."], [378, "386 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Another is dedicated to \" MicajahB. Rowland, May 25, 1801,\" and signed at \"Kentucky, Caulwell Co. Fielding Wools, James Rucker, Presbitry.\" The first election ordered by the Board was August 7, 1838, for September 10, 1838, when one delegate to Congress, members of the Council and House of Representatives of the Legislature of Iowa Territory, one Coroner, one Treas urer, three County Commissioners, one County Assessor, one Recorder and Constables of the county were to be chosen. Meanwhile, a contest had arisen over the location of the county seat. Ben tonsport, Pittsburg, Rochester, Keosauqua and perhaps, other points labored for the prize. The question became a political one. The election referred to was held at Farmington, \" agreeable to provisions of the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Wisconsin, passed June 22, 1838 ; the two places contending for the seat of justice of the county of Van Buren, or what was then the Territory of Wisconsin (now Iowa) being Bentonsport and Keosauqua (this being the name given to the towns of Van Buren and Des Moines City united), and at that election Keosauqua received a majority of the whole number of votes given by the people of said county as the seat of justice (county seat) thereof.\" The election returns were certified to by the Board January 9. It is claimed that Pittsburg also contended for the county seat at that time (Mr. Goddard thinks so). Bentonsport recently clam ored for it. On October 12, 1838, Maryland Jones, one of the Board, was empowered to take measures toward \" securing to this county the quarter-section on which the seat of justice for said county is located, agreeable to an act of Congress, granting the right of pre-emption on said quarter to said county.\" An adjournment was then taken until Monday, January 7, 1839, when the Board met at Keosauqua. On Thursday, June 13, 1839, the Board authorized that lots be laid off on the county quarter and sold at auction, the proceeds of the sale to be applied toward the erection of public buildings ; the terms of the sale to be one-fourth cash, one-fourth in six months, one-fourth in twelve months and one-fourth in eighteen months. Prior to this, a square building of hewed logs had served as the Jail, the Sheriff's portion being of frame, over which was located the District Court room. The building, what remains of it, is now used as a wagon-shop. The superintendency of the new Jail was given to William Stanley on August 7, 1839, and Henry King was the builder. The contract for building the Court House was given to John Fairman and James Hall, with the understanding that it should be finished for $6,000, and within two years from June 1, 1840. An auspicious event was that which was ushered in August 10, 1840, but the beginning of the end of which was not until 1846. On the first date mentioned, the Board ordered that a vote be taken to ascer tain whether a convention was desired by the people to discuss the question of admitting the Territory of Iowa into the Union as an independent State. The convention was called according to the necessary form of procedure, and dele gates were sent to consult with the Members of Congress ; but the scheme fell through on account of the non-acceptance by Congress of the proposition made with regard to the boundary lines. In 1841, Union, Hedvolante (now Des Moines), Lick Creek, Van Buren, Jackson, Farmington, Vernon, Washington, Chequest and Village Townships were created."], [379, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 387 The first reward offered for wolves' scalps was made in January, 1841. This law was rescinded February 11, 1841. Notwithstanding the latter action, Isaac Sutherland, as late as April 6, 1841, \" was allowed $2 for two wolves' scalps, killed by him on or about the 20th of February, 1841,\" ten days after the repeal of the law. An action of the Board, Wednesday, January 6, 1847, altered the boundary line of Lick Creek Township. The change affected the line so as to make it \"extend from the east boundary south to the southeast corner of Section 1, in Van Buren Township ; thence west along the line between Sections 1 and 12, until the said line intersected the left bank of the Des Moines River ; thence up the left bank of the said river to the point where the present southern bound ary of Lick Creek Township intersected the said river. And further, that the portion of Van Buren Township included within the boundaries as above altered, be taken from said Van Buren Township and attached and made a part of Lick Creek Township.\" The first record made of an inquest was May 14, 1856, when the body of an unknown child was found. The verdict of the jury was that the child came to its death through felonious means, a string having been tied about its neck. The jury was composed of John Douds, Daniel McCoy and Simeon Martin. Ambrose Fitzgerald was the Justice before whom the inquest was held. EARLY CRIMINAL EVENTS. The criminal record of Van Buren County is not burdened, either of early or late years \u2014 in fact, there is little to make a record from. There have been but few high crimes. The first arrest made to compensate for the shedding of innocent blood, was that of Lithelus Gillespie, who was arraigned before the Court, the first of the April term, 1837, on the charge of manslaughter. The result of a trial was \"we, the jury, find the prisoner not guilty.\" This was case No. 42 on the calendar. Then came a case that caused a great deal of trouble, and finally wound up in smoke. In April, 1838, Isaac Hendershott was taken into custody on the charge of alleged murder. Read the summing-up of the grand jurors' report: \" Isaac Hendershott, not having the fear of God before his eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, on the 11th day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, at Colum bus, upon one Nathaniel Knapp, feloniously, willfully, and of his malice afore thought, did make an assault on the said Nathaniel Knapp (with a certain drawn sword made of iron and steel, of the value of 50 cents, which he, the said Isaac Hendershott, in both his hands then and there had and held), in and upon the left side of the body between the ribs of him, the said Nathaniel Knapp ; and then and there feloniously, willfully and of his malice aforethought did strike and thrust, giving the said Nathaniel Knapp, then and there, with the sword afore said, in and upon the aforesaid Nathaniel Knapp, one mortal wound of the breadth of one inch and of the depth of six inches, of which mortal wound the said Nathaniel Knapp then and there instantly died.\" The cause of the affray is said to have been a dispute which arose between the two men as to their sleeping apartments. Knapp made a sarcastic remark to which Hendershott took exceptions and the finale was as related. It is claimed, however, that the \" sword \" in question was a cane-sword, or piece of steel used in the head of a cane. Hendershott escaped from prison and fled toward Mexico City, but when twenty-three miles west of Lexington, Mo. , report says, he was taken sick and died."], [380, "388 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. There was also tried a man named John G. McCutchen, during November, 1838, term of the Court, the charge being that he was criminally guilty of de stroying written instruments. He was adjudged guilty, and compelled to pay a fine of $30. The first indictment found for larceny was against John G. McCutchen, John Burton and Stephen Baldwin, in April, 1839. The verdict of the Court was, as per entry on the docket, \" Prosecution severed.\" The first case of kidnapping was in 1839, when indictments for the alleged crime were found against Shapely P. Ross, Shapely Walkfork, Benjamin B. Throop and Giles 0. Sullivan. A number of indictments were found in those \"by-gone\" days against parties for selling liquor to the Indians. Probably the most notable happening in the annals of Washington and Van Buren County crime, was in 1845 ; so, because the hissing ball that robbed a man of his blooming life came but a hair's-breadth of nipping the bud that the father held in his arms ; so, because in that instance the law would not allow outsiders to insult its dignity, and the consummation of the chilling crime came quickly by trial, judgment, sentence, the rope. And, inasmuch as this was the only execution ever effected in this county, the fact rightly claims a few lines in history. The summer of 1845 was the date of the deed, the date in which a young man named William McColly, shot and instantly killed Mr. Don Ferdanand Coffman, who, with his wife, and carrying a child in his arms, was passing a cornfield. The crime was committed in Washington County, but a change of venue was taken and the case came up for a hearing in the Van Buren County Court, then being held at Keosauqua. The prisoner's plea of \"not guilty \" was, at his request, withdrawn, and he pleaded \" guilty.\" Upon which the Court sentenced him to be hanged ; which was done on Tuesday, the 13th day of May, 1845, in the jail-yard. The difficulty grew out of domestic troubles. Coffman's wife and McColly had eloped together. Coffman had induced her to return ; at which McColly became offended. LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENTS. From the session laws of 1840-47, the following; abstract of enactments is made, showing all of the essential bills passed which affected Van Buren County, or all of those not given in proper form in other portions of this volume : January 17, 1840, a bill was approved by the Governor of the Territory of Iowa, providing for the settlement of the claim that Des Moines County had upon the counties of Lee, Van Buren, Henry, Slaughter (Washington), Louisa and Muscatine, in accordance with an act of the Legislature of Wisconsin Ter ritory held at Belmont in 1836. The sentiment was based upon the assess ment of property in the several newly-created counties. The old Territorial road from Black Hawk, Louisa County, to the Missouri line, through Van Buren County, was relocated, or so much of it as lay between Bentonsport and the residence of James Robbs in Van Buren County. Syl vester Henry, John B. Smith and James A. Brown, Commissioners. Approved January 15, 1841. An act approved January 15, 1841, changed the name of Rising Sun to Pittsburg. The town was surveyed by Uriah Biggs. By a special act, approved February 17, 1842, that part of the plat \" above the mouth of Chequest Creek, known as Clayton's Addition,\" was also changed in name to agree with the main plat."], [381, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 389 A Territorial road was relocated in July, 1841, from Keosauqua via Rising Sun (Pittsburg) and Philadelphia, to Fairfield, Jefferson County, or so much as passed through the estate of James F. Westcott. William D. McBride, Elijah Purdom, Sr., and Sewall Kenney, Commissioners. An act, approved January 28, 1842, reads : Be it enacted, etc.. That the County Commissioners of Van Buren County be, and they are hereby authorized and directed, to grant a license to Jesse Wright and Henry Bateman, of said county, for the term of five years, to keep a ferry across the Des Moines River, opposite Water town; provided, said Wright and Bateman shall, in all cases, be subject to the laws regulating ferries in this Territory. The bill expressly provided that this act should not interfere with L. P. Harris' right to obtain a similar license at any time. February 2, 1842, a Territorial road from Keosauqua to the southern boundary of the Territory, via Hale's bridge, on Fox River, and a quarter of a mile north of William Wooden's, on the Wyaconda, was established. John Cantrel, William Cassady and William Brooks, of Van Buren County, Com missioners. The road from the southeast corner of Section 7, Town 27, Range 8 west, to Keosauqua, ordered July, 1841, was authorized by special act, January 3, 1843, to be established by the County Commissioners of Van Buren County. February 6, 1843, the Judge of Probate of Van Buren County was author ized to have the records of his office retranscribed, or so much of them as were written prior to August, 1841. A Territorial road was established from the north boundary of Missouri, at the southwest corner of Section 9, Town 67 north, Range 8 west; thence west to southeast corner of Section 36, Town 68, Range 9 ; thence west eighty rods : thence to James Burns' smith-shop ; thence the shortest and best route to Keo sauqua. Charles Dailey and Thomas Cox, Commissioners. Samuel Gilland, Surveyor. February 13, 1843, a Territorial road was established from Birmingham, via the Colony in Jefferson County, to Indian Agency. William Shepherd, Rob ert Rutlidge and John I. Mudget, Commissioners. In 1843, that part of the road from Fort Madison, Lee County, to Iowa ville, between Hiram Holmes' and the latter place, was resurveyed by E. A. Boy er, John Saylor and William Meacham. The Farmington Insurance Company was incorporated February 17, 1842, with a capital of not less than $50,000, nor more than $500,000, on the stock plan. Jonas Houghton, Isaac A. Le Fever, Jesse Wright, Lawrence Scott and Solomon Beckley were designated Commissioners to open the stock subscription books. The Company was empowered to write all varieties of risks, on sea or land, loan money at not more than 10 per cent interest, and re-insure their risks, as is customary. The business was placed under the management of a Board of Directors, consisting of five. In short, the Company was a regularly organized and full-fledged concern. By an act approved February 17, 1842, all that tract of land recorded by James Hall & Co. as the town of Keosauqua, and described as the northwest quarter of Section 36, Town 69, Range 10, was duly incorporated as the \"City of Keosauqua.\" It was the usual incorporating act, defining the powers of the Mayor and Councilmen. By an act approved December 19, 1843, John Godard and Jesse Wright, of Van Buren County, and Van Caldwell, of Wapello County, were appointed Commissioners to locate a Territorial road from Farmington, via Hartford, E"], [382, "390 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Green's mill and Wood's mill to \" Autumwa \" (the old way of spelling the name). The Commissioners were ordered to meet at Farmington on the first Tuesday in April, of that year, and were duly cautioned as to observing the best interests of the settlers in the two counties. A special act, approved January 25, 1844, ordered the County Commis sioners of Van Buren to allow Thomas Summerlin, Collector for said county, \" such time as they may deem reasonable for said Collector to make return of the tax-list of said county, placed in his hands for collection, for the year 1843, provided that the time did not extend beyond January 1, 1845.\" The Board was authorized to postpone the sale of lands or lots in the county, for delinquent taxes of 1843, not to extend beyond the first Monday in December, 1844. The act also provided for the Board's fixing the date of the tax sales for that year. February 5, 1844, Robert Merchant and Levin N. English, of Davis County, and James Jordan, of Van Buren County, were appointed Commissioners to locate a Territorial road from Iowaville, on the Des Moines River, \" to a point on the line of the State of Missouri, where the Mormon trace crosses said line.\" The Commissioners met at Iowaville on the first Monday in May, 1844. The road was ordered to be laid out \" via the residences of William Wooden and L. N. English.\" February 7, 1844, James Hall, of Van Buren, William Ingersoll, of Jefferson, and Jacob Marshall, of Wapello, were appointed Commissioners to lay out a Territorial road from Iowaville to Autumwa. They were ordered to meet on the first Monday in May, of that. year. February 13, 1844, John Godden, Samuel Clark, John Groom, Archibald McDonald and P. M. Janney were given two years additional time in which to construct a dam and lock at Pittsburg across the Des Moines River. February 14, 1844, Samuel Morton, St. Clair Griffin and John Arrowsmith, of Van Buren County, were appointed Commissioners to locate a Territorial road from Keosauqua to the county seat of Davis County ; thence to the county seat of Appanoose County, or as near the center of that county as practicable ; thence to the west line of that county. The Commissioners were ordered to meet at the house of Solomon Richardson on the first Monday in June, and begin the road at his place. The road already established out of Keosauqua, via Ely's Ford, on the Des Moines River, between Keosauqua and Richardson's, was to form that portion of the new road. The old road from Fort Madison, in Lee County, to Iowaville, was ordered reviewed and established in August, 1844. Benjamin Saylor and Joel Avery were appointed Commissioners. February 15, 1844, the name of Hartford was changed to that of Fleming. A joint resolution was passed by the Legisluture February 14, 1844, requesting the establishment of numerous weekly mail-routes in the State. Among them one from Fox Post Office, Van Buren County, to Davis Court House, thence to center of Appanoose County. Uriah Biggs, of Van Buren, was appointed, by the Legislature, Subagent for that county of the University lands. In 1845, a Territorial road was established by Samuel Swearingen and Israel Kister, of Davis County, and John B. Wilson, of Van Buren, from the Sullivan line of Missouri, where the road from Keosauqua to Churchville crossed; thence on the divide between Fox River and Indian Creek via Fox Post Office, Sabastian Streeter's and L.

CLARK The sketch here given serves to illustrate the dangers and hardships attend ing the settlement of this region, even as late as 1842. In the year 1840, William W. Rankin emigrated from La Fayette, Ind., and located on a temporary or small claim near the extreme western line of the then defined Government lands. The treaty of 1837 opened up to claimants a large area of lands which had been, prior to that date, the stamping-grounds of the Indians. It is necessary to merely allude to this limit here, as the sub ject is properly treated in another portion of the work. When Van Buren County was geographically defined, the western boundary extended to a point within the ceded territory. A strip of land was still left west of the county about a mile and a half in width. This strip lay in what afterward became, subsequent to the Indian treaty of 1842, the county of Davis. The strip was attached to Van Buren County for all judicial and official pur poses, but at the period of which we write was without distinctive title. The year 1840, was a comparatively late one in the settlement of Van Buren, but the attached wild lands had not received much benefit from the civilizing influences of the influx of pioneers in the eastern and central part of Van Buren. West of the county line all was a wilderness. It will be remembered by the early settlers that the general laws of the country forbade encroachments on the Indian lands by white men. Location of claims could not be made except at the hazard of loss of property, if not at the peril of life. Timber could not be cut, nor could game be pursued by whites without risking severe punishment. It is folly to assert that the laws defensive of the rights of the red man were fully observed ; for it is a known fact that timber was stripped from the eastern boundary, and that many a vent uresome hunter added to the zest of his sport by combining the excitement of the chase with a vigorous watchfulness for the stealthy red man. Had an Indian detected a poacher on his domain, the latter would have been summarily"], [384, "392 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. disposed of. This fact is corroborated by the stories told of hair-braadth escapes of hunters under such circumstances. Nor were hunters the only violators of the law of trespass. Some men, foreseeing the advantages of early possession, were reckless enough to make settlers' claim to some of the best locations, just across the boundary, and erect thereon log cabins. The class which carried matters to such an extreme, encountered more than the hostility of outraged Indians ; for at that time the Government made a show of protecting poor Lo in his rights. A system of espionage was maintained after a fashion commensurate with the importance of the case and the crudity of the times. It is not to be supposed that the most thorough watchfulness was observed, for that would be attributing to the Gov ernment a higher degree of paternal feeling than it has ever manifested ; but the appearance of authority was kept up by the appointment of agents and the occasional visitation of suspected localities by those properly empowered repre sentatives of the Great Father at Washington. The men who actually made claims on the Indian territory were, very naturally, persons of the most heedless disposition. The pleasure of making locations there consisted fully as much in the consciousness of law violated, as it did in the sense of semi-proprietorship. It is likely that some of these men were connected with the organized gangs of horse-thieves and counterfeiters which infested the West at that time, and found more freedom there for the prosecution of the latter part of their nefarious trades, as well as a greater immunity from the law of the better settled counties of the Territory. The cabins of such \"claimants \" may have been places of refuge for dangerous men, when pursued by the officers of the law. A sort of friendship may have existed between some of the white renegades and the Indians, which served as a protection to them. At all events, whether these conjectures be reasonable or not, it is certain that the squatters on Indian lands dreaded the white men more than the Indians, and were always ready to defend their wilderness homes from the agents of the Government. When Mr. Rankin located in the narrow strip of land adjacent to Van Buren County, he did so with the intention of seeking a better site as soon as it was possible to do so with safety. He was residing on his claim, which was three miles of the present village of Drakeville, in the year 1842. In 1840, W. G. Clark, who figured so largely in the early history of Mon- roe County, gave up the idea of spending his life in New York City, where he had resided for some ten years, and concluded to seek his fortune in the West. The Territory of Iowa was regarded by the young New Yorker as the further- most limit of the desirable country, or, at all events, far enough away from the whirl of the metropolis to be an available prospecting-ground. He prepared to shake Eastern dust from his feet and join the great army of emigrants which was then moving westward. Among the supplies purchased by him, as a neces- sary preliminary to fortune-hunting, was a pair of very fine bay horses. The team was not only a particularly good one, but it was also a decidedly notice- able pair, because of size and marks. They stood eighteen hands high, were very speedy travelers, and, more remarkable than all else, had been treated to the \" docking process.\" Their tails were cut short after the fashion of that time. In the West, the few teams met with were allowed their normal quantity of caudal appendage, and the introduction of a pair of big \"bob-tailed \" bays caused considerable comment among the pioneers of the new country. Mr. Clark came on to Iowa, and entered the southern portion of the Terri tory. He was in no special haste to locate permanently, and devoted his time"], [385, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 393 to going about from settlement to settlement. Wherever he went, his fine team excited remark, and he was soon known throughout Van Buren County. His horses were also known in the entire region. During the course of his investigation of the country, Mr. Clark went into the attached portion of Van Buren County, and there formed the acquaintance of Mr. Rankin, wife and daughter. The year 1842 found Mr. Clark not only a friend of the Rankins, but a still more particular guest at their house, for he had become engaged to the daughter. The marriage day was not decided upon at once, as it was deemed essential to first select a site for a home. Thus the spring of 1842 beheld Mr. Clark more eager than ever for a speedy termination of his protracted search for a claim. The Indian treaty of 1842 was pending, but no locations could then be made on the beautiful lands contained in the reserve. The sight of the rolling prairies and beautiful groves was too tempt ing to be withstood, and Mr. Clark determined to make a tour of examination in anticipation of the time when he could legally lay claim to a farm site thereon. One day in the late spring, Mr. Clark persuaded the Rankins to join him in a short excursion over the Indian lands, with the view of aiding him in his ultimate choice of a home. The famous team was hitched to a comfortable spring-wagon, and the two ladies, Mrs. and Miss Rankin, were snugly seated for a genuine camping-out trip. The party was provided with necessaries in the way of blankets, etc., but only a limited amount of provisions were taken, as it was not intended to remain out more than two or three days. The first day's journey was a delightful one. The party had driven about sixteen or seventeen miles through a region in a perfect state of nature, and at one of the most charming seasons of the year. Night overtook them just as they came in sight of a deserted log cabin. The discovery of such a building, where reason and law taught them to suppose no building stood, was a surprise indeed. The men made a careful inspection of the premises, and concluded that some squatter had ventured on the reserve, but had become tired of his claim and had forsaken it. Mr. Rankin made the most of their apparent good- fortune, and proceeded to arrange a snug sleeping-place in the cabin for the women. He and Clark fitted up a bed in the wagon for themselves. The horses were tied in a clump of trees some twenty rods from the wagon, and there left in supposed security for the night. The weary travelers were soon fast asleep. Mr. Clark says that he has no idea just how long he slept, but he was awakened in the night by the restless- ness of his horses. He thought nothing of the disturbance, however, and pro- ceeded to compose himself for another nap. Later in the night he was again aroused, but this time by hearing one of his horses break his halter and dash off over the prairie at high speed. Even then his suspicions of evil were not aroused, because he was firm in his belief that no human beings, save them- selves, were within miles of his team. Again he laid his head down, but could not sleep soundly. For a short time all was quiet, when suddenly the remain- ing horse broke loose and scudded away to join its mate. The night was so dark that search was impossible then, and Mr. Clark concluded that he would wait until daylight before beginning his tramp. He thought his horses had gone but a short distance out on the prairie, where they would soon eat their fill and remain quietly until he could capture them. He noticed that neither Mr. Rankin nor the women had been awakened by the disturbance, and that"], [386, "394 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. confirmed him in his determination to await until he could reasonably call upon Mr. R. for assistance. Mr. Clark did not sleep again that night, and as soon as it was daybreak he silently arose, without awakening Mr. Rankin, and went over to where his team had stood. The high grass was trampled down in one direction, and thither he went until he could obtain a commanding view of the surrounding country. He could see that the horses had gone eastward, and the first idea that occurred to him was that they had started back toward the settlement from whence they had come. Mr. Clark felt that every moment was precious, and that he could scarcely afford the time required to return to camp and arouse his friends. If he kept on at once, he might soon overtake the team and get back before the camp was awake. He had taken no food with him, however, and a long tramp was imprudent ; but he would go a short way further and then, if he saw no traces of his horses, he would go back to camp and prepare for a thorough search. So on he pushed, through the wet, harsh prarie grass for some distance. The heavy tread of the horses had left a deep impress in the aod and the rank vegetation was bent and twisted by their rapid movements. Along this trail Mr. Clark hurried, expecting every moment to reach some point from which he could discover more encouraging prospects. Suddenly he came upon a blind track over the prairie. The newly-made trail of his horses ceased, but along the older path he saw the hoof-marks of his team. But that was not all. Side by side with his own horses, another animal had ran from this point on. From the size of the track, Mr. Clark concluded that it must have been an Indian pony. The discovery of this alarming evidence of the cause of the stampede did not create any unpleasant feelings in Mr. Clark's mind. A more experienced Westerner would have retraced his steps at once and aroused the camp ; but Mr. Clark was new to the ways and dangers of the West. He had come from a region where crime was guarded, regulated and spied upon by professionals : where it was not incumbent upon every citizen to play many parts in turn. He did not understand woodcraft or know that detective work was a part of a pioneer's duty. He was not a Leatherstocking, or to the wilderness born. Hence, when the third hoof-print was discovered, he merely surmised that some Indian had gone that way the day before. He did not associate the contiguity of tracks as cause and effect. By this time, Mr. Clark had gone so far that returning without his team seemed impossible. So, on he went. On and on he pushed, now losing the trail and anon finding it, until it became broad day. High noon found him still rambling on, hungry and footsore, but determined to work out the salva tion of his favorite animals. When the meridian of day was passed, and the sunlight fell from the west ward, stray patches of cloud occasionally obscured the rays. These shadows were grateful to the weary man, who did not then realize the awful danger of becoming hopelessly lost on the trackless prairie or in the wild growth of trees that bordered some stream. As night settled down, the clouds increased in density and concealed the sun entirely. The inexperienced young man, deprived of the only sure director, was left in total ignorance of his whereabouts. His long fast of nearly twenty four hours, began to tell upon his unaccustomed muscles. A man bred in city ways cannot endure the privations of wild life like those who are inured to such"], [387, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 395 hardships. The comparative inactivity of mercantile life had made Mr. Clark, who was not thirty years of age at the time of which we write, little fitted for a protracted tramp through the woods. He naturally could not husband his strength, nor could he practice any of the many physical economies known to hunters. In this pitiable plight, night found the wanderer. He had long before that given up search for the trail of his horses, for he had learned that self-preser vation was Nature's first law. At last, exhausted and half-despairing, he set down upon an old log and turned his coat collar about his neck. Compressing himself into as small a compass as possible, he tried to pass the night. Imagine the scene ! A young man, who but a day before saw life stretching out pleasantly in anticipation before him, sound in mind and body, and with every reasonable expectation of prosperity, now lost in the wilderness, without the slightest ray of hope, alone in the darkness and the rain, with the prairie winds whistling and groaning around him as though to aggravate his sense of terror at his situation, and chilling him to the marrow as it drove the gusts of rain upon his unprotected head. Think of that long, dreary night, which seemed interminable to him. Added to all the imaginary dangers, were the ever-present pangs of hunger, gnawing at his vitals and weakening him minute by minute. If ever the daylight was welcomed by mortal in distress, surely that which told the hero of this sketch the east from the west was. The long hours which succeeded the rising of the sun behind a gray and crimson bank of clouds were but repetitions of those of the preceding day. Early in the morning, the rain began to fall, and continued ceaselessly day and night. The tall prairie grass, which cut like knife-blades, soon wore away the fine cloth pants which Clark then wore, leaving the flesh naked to their cruel teeth. In self-protection, he bound leaves about his legs, and plodded on, not knowing whither. More than once, a bird, startled by the strange apparition of an unknown being, flew from her nest, revealing the brood of unfledged young within. The instinct to \u25a0devour those little birds was strong ; but the force of civilized habits overcame, for the time, the savage nature of man. Now and then, an elm-tree was found, and from the inner bark of it the famished man ate greedily. Wild strawberry leaves, and such vegetation as was known to be edible, formed the staple of his unsatisfactory diet. Again night shut down upon him, and despair hovered over the almost desperate man. In the darkness he heard the weird cry of noc turnal birds. His cars were keen to detect unnatural sounds. Above his hard resting-place rang out the terrifying shriek of a panther, and in the distance the barking of wolves could be distinctly heard. In the darkness he arose and moved about, impressed with a sense of greater security if in motion. Day succeeded night. Another weary march, another fruitless search for traces of human habitation. Again the sun sank and shut out the monotonous landscape. The wanderer gathered boughs and made a rude shelter from the piercing wind. Sleep forsook him, and a long watch for light began. Three days had passed since he had eaten Christian food. The fearful thought that he had gone from his friends without acquainting them of his purpose intensified his agony of mind and body. The horses gone and he himself missing must have aroused the strangest thoughts among"], [388, "396 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. his friends. The morning came at last, but it found him in nearly an ex hausted frame. Fortune at last smiled upon the persistent efforts made by Mr. Clark. Had the last day of his experiences in the wilderness ended like those which pre ceded, this story would have been far different in character. A tale of secret disappearance, a few bleached human bones, discovered by some settler on the spot, and an unraveled mystery, would have been the leading points. As it proved, the search made for a habitation led to the discovery of a cabin on the plains. A fierce dog bounded out to attack the poor, tattered man, as he stag gered up to the door and called for aid. The settler came to his rescue, and soon supplied him with food. His life was saved. Mr. Clark remained a short time at the cabin, and then pushed on toward where he learned the campers must be. The settler aided in the work of re-uniting the separated friends. As good luck would have it, Mr. Rankin was soon seen coming toward them, and the story of Mr. Clark's bewilderment and escape was speedily told. It was afterward ascertained that Mr. C. traveled some twenty miles or more from the camp, and that at least three times that distance must have been traversed by him in his wanderings. The sequel to this story is fully as interesting as the account here given of the experiences of Mr. C. The pony-track seen in the grass on the first day satisfied the settlers that Mr. Clark's horses had been stolen. The amateur detectives took up the clue from the known occupants of the cabin where the party camped, the fact of the absence of the men, etc., and followed the trail south, into Missouri. The peculiar docking of the horses' tails, the large size and fine appearance made it an easy task to trace the animals out. Near Lan caster, Mo., the team was recovered, and a man named Shaffer was arrested by the posse, charged with the crime. A fellow named Wooden was suspected of complicity in the matter, but he was not proved guilty. Shaffer was taken by force and brought into Van Buren County. As the posse had no warrant to take him in Missouri, he was allowed to go free on Van Buren soil, and then immediately arrested on a legal process. The crime for which he was taken having been committed on Indian territory, which was not within the jurisdiction of the Van Buren District Court, necessitated his trial at Fort Madison, in the L^nited States District Court. Shaffer was confined at Keosauqua pending the required preliminary proceedings, and thence taken to Fort Madison. There the trial resulted in a verdict of guilty. The law did not provide incarceration for such offenses, but it did not allow a total relinquishment of a prisoner proven guilty. The verdict, in com pliance with the general statute, was the infliction of twenty-odd lashes upon the bare back. Accordingly, the proper officer proceeded to carry out the finding of the Court. Shaffer was stripped, and the lash was heartily laid on his quivering flesh. This was probably the last public whipping ever adminis tered in the Territory under orders of a lawful court. Judge Lynch often ruled such punishment ; but the more civilized officers of the regular judiciary adopted a less summary method of punishment. The whipping was done in 1843. The place where Mr. Clark was lost is now known as Hacklebarney, in Davis County."], [389, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 397 POEM. Written for ami read before the Old Settlers of Van Buren County, at their Annual Meeting, August 19, 1874. ;*t Keosauqua, low* BY KATE IIAKKINGTON. Kind friends, 'twas something new for me to say I'd meet the dear Old Settlers here to-day. Tis passing strange I should consent to come, To leave the privacy of hearth and home, And thus present a paradox to you \u2014 A maiden effort at full forty-two. Yet 'tis appropriate \u2014 I mean the age \u2014 For veteran soldier, nor yet gray-haired sage, E' er looks for fresh young spring to re-appear When autumn strews the ground with leaflets sere. Life's soft October, with its golden glow, Brings back to us the vanished long ago. The eyes that followed us, the hands we prest, The smile that thrilled us and the voice that blessed. From countless homes, Old Settlers, have there passed Lives all too beautiful and bright to last ; The dear ones cherished in our bosom's core Who wait for us till life's brief dream is o'er. This ground is hallowed. Though our mortal sight May not behold the ladder from yon height Let softly down, that shining ones may stream Along its path, as in the patriarch's dream, Still do they come, their white robes gleaming there The sunlight shimmering through their golden hair ; All silently they join your waiting throng, And, hushed and solemn, list to prayer and song. Go with me first to quiet Farmington. From my old home my flight shall be begun, And ere my fancy takes its circling round Kneel with her there on consecrated ground. With the low murmur of the near Des Moines, In solemn requiem let our voices join ; Our footfalls, too, must take a softer tread Above the sacred sods that hold our dead. 'Tis most like home \u2014 that city on the hill, Whose inmates sleep so peacefully and still. 'Tis there the oldest settler calmly rests, With still hands folded on his pulseless breast. Upon the marble, gleaming pure and white, We read the names of Alfrey, Dickey, Wright, Swazey and Kelley, Bolter, Good and Shreeves, From slumbers roused not by the whispering leaves : All undisturbed by the green boughs that moan Their ceaseless miserere o'er each stone."], [390, "398 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Oh ! stout the hearts beyond the ocean's waves, Who left, on England's shores, their fathers' graves ; Who came, Columbia's wilderness to tread Without the sacred ashes of their dead ; Who felt that nevermore might lips be pressed To flowers that bloomed above a mother's breast. Who left behind, mid throes of anguish wild, The consecrated mound that held a child. 'T would matter little where my steps might rove Did not this magnet draw \u2014 the graves I love. In Farmington, a score of years ago, When times were easy \u2014 locomotion slow \u2014 We used to be so quietly content : We wondered what life's hurried action meant. 'Twas Smith and Barton through that peaceful calm, But when the action came 'twas Smith and Schramm, For, with the railroad came a change of work, And pills and powders must give way to pork. There's many a sturdy farmer here to-day Who took his porkers there with loud display, And, home returning with his merchandise, Displayed to wife's and daughter's wondering eyes The lovely dresses, they had oft been told Would surely come the day the pork was sold. Republicans ! if any man you seek To prove your doctrine, take old Dr. Meek ! I heard him at the opening of the war, When every word he uttered left a scar. You see, just then, we didn't quite agree, And so he made his opening charge on me. Am I disloyal ? Wait, and hear me through, And then pass sentence, ye who donned the blue. The upward growth of Farmington was planned When Charley Gleckler left the Fatherland ; For her it were indeed a sad affair Had he not settled permanently there, And with him all such men as Tuttle, Bower, Perry and Whitlock, Anderson and Tower, Cooley and French, with Campbell, Browning, Rice, Stoddard and Miller, Thompson, Ringer, Price, Manning and Bateman, Church and Kings the twain, Goodin and Davidson, Flood, Willis, Hayne, And dear old Deacon Smith, whose blindness here Will make Heaven's cloudless radiance dawn more clear.

Hon. Charles Negus is the author of the following history of the Missouri- Iowa boundary difficulty. The story as here told contains none of the per sonal incidents of the \" war,\" but must be accepted as a reliable record, worth preserving and fair in every particular. He says : \" Soon after the organizing of the territorial government of Iowa, there arose a dispute between Missouri and Iowa about the jurisdiction of the State and Territorial authorities over a tract of country in the southern part of Iowa, which Missouri claimed as being within the boundary of that State as defined by Congress. \" The act of Congress, passed March 6, 1820, authorizing the Territory of Missouri to form a State government, provided that (if the State should ratify the boundaries) the State of Missouri ' should consist of all the territory within the following boundaries : Beginning in the middle of the Mississippi River, on the parallel of 36\u00b0 north latitude ; thence west, along that parallel of lat itude, to the St. Francis River ; thence up and following the course of that river, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the parallel of 36\u00b0 30' ; thence west along the same to the point where the said parallel is intersected by a meridian line passing through the middle of the mouth of the Kansas River, where the same empties into the Missouri River ; thence, from the point aforesaid, north along the west meridian line, to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the river Des Moines, making said line to correspond with the Indian boundary line, etc. ; thence east, from the point of intersection last aforesaid, along the said parallel of latitude to the middle of the channel of the main fork of the said River Des Moines ; thence down and along the middle of the said River Des Moines, to the mouth of the same, where it empties into the Mississippi,' etc. These boundaries, as defined by Congress, were adopted by Missouri through the Convention which formed the State Constitution. \"The northern boundary of the State, which was defined as ' the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the river Des Moines,' though it might have been well understood at the time, was vague and uncertain, and subsequently gave grounds for an open dispute. \" In the treaties made with the Sacs and Foxes and the Iowa Indians on the 4th of August, 1824, for the purchase of a portion of their lands, it is set forth that they sold to the United States all their lands within the limits of the State of Missouri, which are situated, lying and being between the Missis sippi and Missouri Rivers, and a line running from the Missouri at the mouth of the Kansas River, north 100 miles to the northwest corner of the State of Mis souri, and thence east to the Mississippi. The line, as defined in this treaty, commencing at the mouth of the Kansas River, thence running 100 miles due north, and thence east until it strikes the Des Moines River, had been run in 1816, by John C. Sullivan, and duly marked by blazing trees, driving stakes and erecting mounds. \" But in a period of between twenty and thirty years, those marks had be come so obliterated that they were not easily to be found, and the rapids of the river Des Moines was so uncertain a place that it was hard for those first settling the country at the time Iowa was first opened for white settlement, to designate where the northern boundary of Missouri was located. There being several rapids in the Des Moines River, and one of considerable fall, near Keosauqua,"], [400, "408 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. in Van Buren County (a fall in eighty rods of twenty-one inches), the Missou rians claimed that the latter were the rapids referred to, in the act of Congress authorizing Missouri to form a State Constitution, as a point in defining their boundaries. And in 1837, the authorities of Missouri, without the co-operation of the United States, or of the Territory of Iowa (then Wisconsin), appointed Commissioners to run and mark the northern boundary. \"The Commissioners so appointed, instead of commencing to run the line upon the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the river Des Moines in the Mississippi, proceeded to search for rapids in the Des Moines River itself, from which to commence. They finally fixed upon the ripples in the great bend in the Des Moines River, in Van Buren County, which they assumed to be the rapids of the Des Moines River named in the act of Congress of 1820, and in the Constitution of Missouri, notwithstanding those ripples had never been known as 'the rapids of the river Des Moines.' From this point, the Commissioners proceeded to run and mark a line, which the authorities of that State claimed was the northern boundary, while the early history of the West showed, and it was subsequently decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, that the rapids of the river Des Moines were in the Mississippi River. \" Gen. Pike, who first explored the Upper Mississippi, after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase by the United States, in his journal, kept while ascending the river in 1805, says he ' arrived at the foot of the rapids Des Moines at 7 o'clock,' and thus goes on to give an account of the difficulties he had in getting over those rapids with his boat, on his way up the Mississippi River. And, after passing the rapids, in writing to Gen. Wilkinson, he dates his letter, ' Head of the Rapids Des Moines.' Also, in his map of the Upper Mississippi, Pike lays down the Rapids Des Moines as being in the Mississippi River, a short distance above the mouth of the Des Moines River. And, before the United States acquired possession of this territory in 1779, Zenon Tendeau, acting as Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana, in one of his official acts, says : ' It is permitted to Mr. Lewis (Fesson) Honore to establish himself at the head of the rapids of the river Des Moines.' Upon this grant, Honore made an actual settlement and improvement immediately upon the banks of the Missis sippi River, at the head of the Des Moines Rapids in that River, some eighteen or twenty miles above its mouth. \" These, with other references, go to show that, at an early day, the rapids in the Mississippi opposite the southern extremity of Iowa, were known as the ' rapids of the river Des Moines,' but the authorities of Missiouri claimed and contended for many years that the rapids referred to by Congress, and in their Constitution were in the Des Moines River and near Keosauqua. The north ern boundary of that State, as long as there were no settlements there, was a matter of little consequence to her citizens, and there was no one to dispute their claims until after the Black Hawk Purchase, which was made in 1832. \" The Territory of Wisconsin, in organizing the county of Van Buren, made her southern boundary extend to the southern line, and the same boundaries were claimed by Iowa as soon as she assumed a territorial government. The territorial government of Iowa went into operation on the 4th day of July, 1838, and at that time the boundaries between Missouri and Iowa had not been settled, and there was a strip of Government land about ten miles wide which both govern ments claimed. The county of Van Buren, as organized by the Legislature of Wisconsin, before Iowa assumed a territorial government, embraced within her boundary a portion of this disputed tract of land."], [401, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 409 \"The County Court of Clark County, Mo., in levying the taxes for that county, enrolled the settlers on this disputed tract, as being citizens of that State and belonging to that county, and, having placed their names upon the tax-list, ordered Uriah S. Gregory, the Sheriff of that county, to collect the taxes. Accordingly, the Collector of Clark County went on the disputed tract to collect the taxes, but the tax-payers refused to pay, and the officer undertook to collect them by levying upon their property ; but while endeavoring to do this, some of the citizens of Van Buren County sued out a warrant from a magistrate and placed it in the hands of Henry Heffleman, the Sheriff of Van Buren County, who arrested the Missouri officer, and, there being no jail suitable for retaining prisoners nearer than Muscatine, he was taken to that county and there lodged in jail. \" This act aroused the citizens of Clark County, and an application was made to Gov. Boggs, of Missouri, for the military power of the State to aid the civil officers in maintaining their authority, and to enforce the law of Missouri over the disputed tract. He accordingly dispatched Gen. Allen, with a thousand men, to the place of contention. \" Gov. Lucas, of Iowa, was as determined and fixed in his purpose to main tain the rights of his State as the authorities of Missouri were to exact theirs, and for this purpose ordered Maj. Gen. J. B. Brown to call out the militia and march with his forces to Van Buren County to protect the citizens. \" At this time, the militia of Iowa was poorly organized ; but Gen. Brown gave orders to his subordinates to beat up for recruits, and the citizens were not backward in enrolling themselves by voluntary enlistment, and, in a short time, about five hundred men, with arms, were assembled in Van Buren County, and others were on their way, amounting, in all, to about twelve hundred men, and the gathering of military forces had all the appearance of a fierce and bloody civil war. But before there was any collision between the two forces, Gen. Brown, from his officers, selected Gen. A. C. Dodge, of Burlington, Gen. Churchman, of Dubuque, and Dr. Clark, of Ft. Madison, as an embassy to the enemy to try to negotiate a peace. \" On arriving at Waterloo, the county seat of Clark County, they found that the County Court of that county had rescinded the order to the Sheriff to collect the taxes on the disputed tract, and had sent a special delegation to wait upon Gov. Lucas and the Legislature of Iowa, then assembled at Burlington, for the purpose of making some amicable adjustment of the difficulties, and that Gen. Allen, with his forces, had withdrawn from the contest. Upon receiving this information, the embassy returned to their headquarters, and the Iowa forces were disbanded and permitted to return to their homes. \"Col. McDaniels and Dr. Wayland, the representatives of Clark County, came to Burlington and waited upon Gov. Lucas, who, not evincing much dispo sition to adjust matters, they then went before the Legislature, which body, after hearing their proposition, passed a set of resolutions, with a preamble, express ing their views. In the preamble, they set forth the difficulties existing between Iowa and Missouri, and that Iowa, under any circumstances, deprecated any military collision between the forces of the State of Missouri and the Territory of Iowa, and reciprocated the kind feelings evinced by the delegation from the County Court of Clark County, and Resolved, That the officers now on the part of Missouri be respectfully requested to suspend all further military operations on the part of said State until these resolutions can be submitted to His Excel lency, Gov. Boggs ; that His Excellency, Gov. Boggs, be requested to authorize a suspension of hostilities on the part of the State of Missouri until the 1st day"], [402, "410 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. of July next, with a view to having the unfortunate difficulties now existing between the State of Missouri and the Territory of Iowa adjusted by the act of Congress ; that His Excellency, the Governor of Iowa, be requested to suspend all further military operations until the decisions of his Excellency, Gov. Boggs, may be obtained relative to the proposition herein contained ; that the Governor be requested forthwith to forward a copy of these resolutions to the Governor of Missouri, one to the County Court of Clark County and copies to the officers in command on the disputed grounds, to be by them presented to the officers of the Missouri forces. \" These proceedings on the part of the Legislature had a tendency to quiet things for a time. The Sheriff of Clark County was, however, indicted at the next term of the court in Van Buren County for his attempt to collect taxes in the disputed tract ; but the Prosecuting Attorney entered a nolle prosequi, and he was discharged from custody. \" On the 10th of November, 1841, Thomas Reynolds, Governor of Missouri, who was the successor to Gov. Boggs, addressed a letter to John Chambers, who was at that time Governor of Iowa, in which he informed him that the Legisla ture of Missouri, at their last session, passed an act directing the Governor of Missouri to bring a suit on behalf of Uriah S. Gregory, the late Collector of Clark County, against Henry Heffleman, the Sheriff of Van Buren County, for the purpose of having the question of boundary between Iowa and Missouri finally adjusted in the Supreme Court of the United States. As Heffleman and others who arrested Gregory resided in Iowa, such a suit should have been commenced in Iowa. Gov. Reynolds wished to know if suit was thus commenced whether the authorities of Iowa would consent to make such an agreed case on the record as would insure a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the question of boundary. \" To this Gov. Chambers replied that this question, as it appeared to him, was one over which the Territorial authorities had no control ; for, ' by an express reservation in' the laws organizing the Territory of Iowa, the boundary remained subject to the future control of Congress.' And Gov. Chambers also expressed his doubts whether, under the Constitution of the United States, the Supreme Court, even upon an agreed case and by consent of parties, would take jurisdiction of an alleged controversy between one of the States and a Territory remaining subject to the laws of Congress. But he assured Gov. Reynolds that he would lay his communication before the next Legislature of the Territory, and if that body should differ from the views he had entertained upon the sub ject, their decisions should immediately be made known to him. But it appears that the Legislature concurred with the views of Gov. Chambers, for there were no steps taken to comply with the request of Missouri as made by Gov. Reynolds. \" The expenses of Iowa in calling out the militia to maintain her rights and enforce the laws on the disputed tract were upward of $13,000. Some of those expenses were borne by individuals whose circumstances were such that they could not well afford to lose the amount justly due them. Congress was memorialized by the Territorial Legislature to make an appropriation to meet these expenses, and on two occasions a bill was passed through the House pro viding for their payment, but both bills failed to pass the Senate. \" Samuel C. Reed, of Van Buren County, who lived near where the troops were rendezvoused to defend and maintain the rights of Iowa against the intru sion of Missouri, having furnished to them provisions to the amount of nearly $200, being a man in limited circumstances, and having waited several years"], [403, "411 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. with the hope of getting something from the General Government, and not succeeding, petitioned the Territorial Legislature to allow and make an appro priation for his claim. \" Reed was regarded as a patriotic and generous man, and he did all he could to sustain the rights of Iowa in her troubles with Missouri, and having met with misfortunes, and being much reduced in his circumstances, his appeal to the Legislature elicited their sympathy, and they passed a bill allowing his claims, with 6 per cent interest, and made an appropriation for paying it ; but this did not meet with the approbation of Gov. Clark, at that time Governor of the Territory, and he returned the bill with his veto. His objections were that the Legislature should make no discrimination among those who aided the au thorities in the troubles with Missouri ; if the Territory undertook to pay one they should pay all ; that if Iowa should assume these debts the United States, which was in duty bound to pay them, would not ; that Iowa was soon to become a State, when she would have a representation and vote in both branches of Congress, and tlfen, in all probability, would be able to get an appropriation to defray those expenses. But for one cause or another, neither Reed nor any of the others who furnished means or rendered services in the war with Missouri, got pay for that which was justly their due. \" For the purpose of ascertaining and defining the southern boundary of Iowa, Congress, on the 18th of June, 1838, passed an act in which it was pro- vided that the President should cause to be surveyed, and distinctly marked, the southern boundary line of Iowa ; and for that purpose he was required to appoint a Commissioner on the part of the United States, who, with the neces- sary surveyors, was to act in conjunction with a Commissioner to be appointed by the State of Missouri, and one to be appointed by the Governor of Iowa, in ' running, marking and ascertaining' the boundary line ; and it was made the duty of the Commissioner who was to be appointed by the President, to prepare three plats of this survey, one of which was to be returned to the Secretary of State of the United States, one to the office of the Secretary of State of Mis- souri and one to the Secretary of the Territory of Iowa. \" And it was also provided that if the Commissioner on the part of Missouri, or of Iowa, should fail to attend, or if either or both the State of Missouri or the Governor of Iowa should fail to appoint, then the Commissioner of the United States, by himself, or such Commissioner as did attend, should proceed to run the boundary line between Missouri and Iowa. But the line so run and marked was not to be fully established until the survey should be submitted to, and the boundary thus ascertained and marked be approved of and ratified by Congress. \"In pursuance of this act, the President appointed Maj. A. M. Lee as Commissioner on the part of the United States, and Dr. James Davis was appointed for Iowa, but Missouri failed to make any appoinment. Maj. Lee, in company with Dr. Davis, proceeded to make the survey as required by Con- gress, and made their report to the Secretary of the Territory of Iowa, on the 15th of January, 1839, about the time the difficulty was taking place on the dis- puted tract in Van Buren County. But it seems that the line surveyed by Lee and Davis was never approved of by Congress, and consequently did not become the boundary between Missouri and Iowa. \" Soon after the troubles in Van Buren County, the Legislature of Iowa passed a law that if any person should exercise any official function within the jurisdiction of the Territory, or within the limits of any of the counties therein, by virtue of any commission or authority not received from the Territory or Gov-"], [404, "412 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. ernment of the United States, every person so offending should be fined, not exceeding $1,000, or be imprisoned not exceeding five years. That if any per son residing within the limits of the Territory should accept of any office or trust from any State or authority other than the United States or the Territory of Iowa, every person so offending should be fined not exceeding $1,000, or be imprisoned not exceeding five years. \" Soon after the organization of the county of Davis, this law was called into requisition. The county of Adair, as it was then organized, embraced within its boundaries a portion of what now composes Davis County. The Sheriff of Adair County, Preston Mullinix, and his Deputy, William P. Linder, were indicted in Davis County ; the Sheriff for exercising his office within the bound aries of Iowa, without legal authority and contrary to the statutes, and the Dep uty for an assault and battery and kidnapping and falsely imprisoning one Frederick Acheson, a citizen of Iowa, which acts were done on the disputed tract. \" Mullinix and Linder were both arrested and held under bail to answer to the indictment at the next term of court. At that time they both appeared and Linder went to trial, which resulted in his conviction and a sentence of a fine and ten days' imprisonment in the Penitenitiary. The trial of Mullinix, the Sheriff, was continued to the next term of Court, and he was required to enter into a recognizance (without security) for his appearance, which he refused to do, and the Court ordered him to be committed to prison. \" As soon as these transactions were made known to Gov. Chambers, he par doned Linder and remitted his fine, and also pardoned Mullinix for the offense for which he stood committed, and ordered him to be discharged from prison. After the arrest of Mullinix and Linder, the county of Adair was divided, and the territory adjoining Davis County was embraced within the limits of Schuy ler County. \"After the county of Schuyler, Mo., was organized, about the 1st of Janu ary, 1846, Samuel Riggs, the Sheriff of Davis County, Iowa, had put into his hands a writ of attachment against the property of an individual on the tract of land in dispute, and while attempting to serve the writ, he was arrested by the Sheriff of Schuyler County, on a charge of attempting to execute the functions of his office in Missouri, and was required to give security for his appearance at the next term of the Court in that county. A few days after this, another attempt was made by a large number of men from Missouri to resist the execution of a process in the hands of the Sheriff of Davis County, but without success ; for the Sheriff and his posse, though inferior in numbers, executed the writ, and secured the property attached. This dispute, as to who had jurisdiction over this country, had a bad influence in the community, and caused many reckless and desperate characters to rendezvous in that vicinity, with the hope that in the contest with the authorities they might escape the punishment justly due their crimes. \" The arrest of the Sheriff of Davis County called forth a special message from Gov. Clark, then Governor of the Territory, to the Legislature of Iowa, which was then in session, and they passed a special law authorizing the Governor to draw upon the Territorial Treasurer for the sum of $1,500, and that the sum, or any amount thereof, which he might think proper, should be placed at his discretion for the employment of counsel to manage and defend all cases growing out of this difficulty, in which the Territory, or any of the citizens thereof, should be a party on the one side, and Missouri, or the authori ties of that State, upon the other. The court of Schuyler County convened at"], [405, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 413 Lancaster, the county seat, on the 9th of May, and an indictment was found against Riggs, who immediately appeared and answered thereto in discharge of his bail. \" David Rorer, of Burlington, a gentleman of high legal talents, was em ployed by Gov. Clark, on behalf of Iowa, to defend Riggs. Rorer attended this term of Court for the purpose of defending him, but from a desire on the part of both parties to defer judicial action in the case until an adjustment of the disputed boundary question could be effected, the case was continued until the next term of Court, and Riggs was discharged upon his own individual recognizance, and he was subsequently discharged entirely. To compensate him for his trouble and expense, the Iowa Legislature passed a law authorizing him to file his petition in the District Court of Davis County, claiming com pensation for his time and expenses in defending himself against all prosecu tions which had been commenced against him by the authorities of Missouri. for exercising his office on the disputed territory ; and they provided that the Court should hear the case and determine the amount which was justly due Riggs, and the amount so determined was directed to be paid out of the State Treasury. \" On the 17th of June, 1844, Congress passed an act respecting the north ern boundary of Missouri, in which it was provided that the Governor of Iowa, by and with the advice and consent of the Council of the Territory, should appoint a Commissioner to act in conjunction with a Commissioner to be appointed by the State of Missouri, and the two were to select a third person, and it was made their duty to ascertain, survey and mark out the northern boundary of Missouri, and to cause plats of their survey to be returned to the Secretary of the United States, and to the Secretary's office of Missouri and Iowa \u2014 which plats were to be accompanied with their proceedings in the premises. The Commissioners were empowered to employ surveyors and other hands necessary to accomplish the survey, and the line established and ratified by them, or any two of them, was to be final and conclusive, and to be and remain as the northern boundary line of the State. But it was provided that this act should not go into effect until it should be assented to by Missouri and Iowa. Iowa was willing to accede to this proposition, and the Legislature of Missouri passed an act assenting to this mode of settling the difficulty ; but the Governor of Missouri, John C. Edwards, placed his veto on the bill, and it failed to become a law. The Governor's objection to this mode of settling the difficulty seemed to be, that it involved legal rights, and should be adjudicated by a judicial tribunal. \"After this, application was made by both contending parties to Congress to pass a law authorizing them to institute a suit in the Supreme Court of the United States and have the controversy judicially settled. This application was made on the part of Missouri by an act passed by the Legislature, on the 25th of March, 1845, and on the part of Iowa by a memorial of her Council and House of Representatives, passed on the 17th of January, 1846, in which both parties asked for ' the commencement and speedy determination of such a suit as might be necessary to procure a final decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon the true location of the northern boundary of the State.' Congress respected these requests and passed the necessary law. \"After the passage of the law by Congress, authorizing the settling of the dispute in the Supreme Court, the Legislature of Iowa passed an act empower ing the Governor to agree with Missouri for the commencement of such a suit as might be necessary to procure from the Supreme Court of the United States"], [406, "414 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. a final decision upon the true location of the southern boundary of the State. This act made it the duty of the Governor to cause to be procured all evidence which might be necessary to the legal and proper decision of such a suit, and to employ counsel and do whatever else might be necessary to maintain the rights of the State. Charles Mason was employed on the part of Iowa, who hunted up and prepared the testimony of the trial, and he got Thomas Ewing, of Ohio, to assist him in arguing the case before the Court. The State of Mis souri filed the original bill against the State of Iowa, and Iowa filed a cross bill against Missouri. \" This case was tried at the December term of 1848, and the Supreme Court decided that the line as surveyed by Sullivan was the northern boundary of Missouri, which decision gave Iowa all the territory she claimed. The Court appointed Henry B. Hendershott, of Iowa, and Joseph C. Brown, of Missouri, Commissioners to run out and mark the boundary line. Brown having died before the work was commence !, Robert W. Wells was appointed in his place, but he resigned the trust, and William G. Minor received the appointment on the part of Missouri. \" The Commissioners, for the purpose of making the necessary arrange ments for the survey, met at St. Louis in March, 1850, and selected their sur veyors. William Dewey was selected on the part of Iowa, and Robert Walker for Missouri. The Commissioners made their arrangements to meet with their surveyors and other parties, at the point where Sullivan had established the northwest corner of Missouri. They left their respective homes on the 10th of April and met on the 28th. To aid them in their work before they started, they obtained from the office of the Surveyor General at St. Louis a copy of the field-notes of Sullivan's survey ; but the space of nearly thirty-four years having elapsed since this work was done, the marks of the survey being nearly all obliterated, they could not readily find the spot they sought. No precise traces of the old northwest corner remained ; the witness-trees to it were on the margin of a vast prairie, and had apparently been destroyed years before ; con sequently its exact position could not be ascertained from anything visible near the spot. \" The point known as the old northwest corner of Missouri was the northern termination of Sullivan's line, running north and south, run by him in 1816. and was 100 miles north of the mouth of the Kansas River, and the point at which he turned east run to the Des Moines River. His field-notes showed that his miles were numbered north from the Kansas River, and east from the northwest corner of the State, beginning anew at that corner. Finding no conclusive evi dence of the exact site or the required corner, they undertook to trace those lines for the purpose of finding some evidence of the old survey. \"Near the supposed spot of the location of the ninety-ninth mile-corner, on the north line, they found a decayed tree and stump, which corresponded in course, distance and description with the witness-trees to that corner, and cutting into the tree they saw what they supposed to be the remains of an old blaze, upon which was preserved a part, apparently, of the letter M. This supposition was verified by their measuring two miles further south to a point which they found to be Sulli van's ninety-seventh mile-corner, from one witness-tree, which was perfectly sound ; the marks upon it two or three inches beneath the bark were plain and legible. On the east line they found the witness-tree to the third mile-corner ; the wood upon which the marks had been inscribed was decayed, but their reversed impression appeared upon the new growth which covered the old blaze, and was cut out in a solid block. Prolonging these lines three miles from the points"], [407, "415 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. thus determined, their intersection was assumed as the required corner, and at that point was planted a monument designating the northwest corner of Missouri as the boundary existed before acquiring that tract of land known as the ' Plat Purchase,' lying between the old west line of that State and the Missouri River, which point was found to be in the northeast quarter of Section 35, in Town ship 67 north, Range 33 west, in latitude 40\u00b0, 34', 40\" north, and in longitude about 94\u00b0 30' west from Greenwich. \" At this point they planted a large cast-iron pillar, weighing between fifteen and sixteen hundred pounds, four feet six inches long, twelve inches square at the base and eight inches at the top. This pillar was legibly marked with the words ' Missouri ' on the south side, ' Iowa ' on the north side, and ' State Line ' on the east. From this corner they ran one west, keeping on the same parallel of latitude on which the pillar was erected, till they reached the Missouri River. They commenced the survey on the 24th of May, and reached the river, a distance of sixty miles and sixty-one chains, on the 12th of July. At the ter minus of the sixtieth mile, as near the bank of the Missouri River as the per ishable nature of the soil would permit, they planted a monument similar to the one erected at the old northwest corner of Missouri, the words ' State Line ' facing the east. \" The Commissioners then returned to the old northwest corner, and com menced to run the line east, and, by close examination, they were enabled to discover abundant blazes and many witness-trees of the old survey, by which they easily found and re-marked the line run by Sullivan in 1816. The sur veying of the eastern portion of the line was commenced on the 13th of August, and terminated on the 18th of September, it being a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, forty-one chains and eight links, which, with the sixty miles and sixty-one chains first surveyed, makes the southern boundary of the State between the Missouri and Des Moines Rivers two hundred and eleven miles, thirty-two chains and eight links. \"Near the west bank of the Des Moines River, where the boundary termi nates, on the line was planted a cast-iron pillar similar to the other two, with the words \" State Line ' fronting the west. The line was also designated by cast-iron pillars four feet long, eight inches square at the base and five inches at the top, placed at intervals of thirty miles apart ; and one four feet long, seven inches square at the base and four at the top, at intermediate spaces of ten miles apart, all of which pillars mark in iron monument every ten miles the whole length of the boundary line. \" Sullivan's line was found in some places to deviate from a true east and west line, which was corrected by the surveyors. The iron pillars were planted in Sullivan's line as found at the particular points ; but as the line was bending in the ten-mile spaces between the pillars, it was found necessary to erect wooden posts at the termination of each mile in order to mark the line with more accuracy. In the prairies the mile-posts were marked with the letters ' B. L.' facing the east, the letter ' I.' facing the north, and the letter ' M.' facing the south, and the number of miles on the, west face of the post. Where tim ber exists, the number of the mile is marked on witness-trees, or pointers, with letters appropriate to each stake, there being one tree marked on each side of the line wherever it was possible to do so. The front of each witness-tree is marked with the letters ' B. L.' In all cases where the posts are set in mounds, the post is invariably nine links west, to designate it from other surveys. This line, as surveyed and designated under the direction of the Commissioners Hendershott and Minor, was adjudged and decreed by the Supreme Court to be"], [408, "416 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. the true and proper boundary line between Missouri and Iowa. And thus closed a long and vexed dispute between the two authorities about the extent of their jurisdiction. To defray the expenses of establishing and running this line, the State of Iowa and the State of Missouri each placed at the disposal of the Com missioners the sum of $2,000. But this was not sufficient to meet their expenses, for they were engaged at the work 180 days, and the Supreme Court allowed the Commissioners each the sum of $10 per day for their services, and $2 per day for their expenses, and each of the surveyors $8 per day. These allowances, with other expenses, cost over $10,000, which left over $3,000 apiece for each of the States to pay. The Legislatures of either State made up the deficiencies, and that was an end to the boundary war.\" THE DES MOINES IMPROVEMENT SCHEMES. Mr. Charles Negus, an authority in matters pertaining to the history of Iowa, published the following interesting account of the various improvement schemes connected with the Des Moines River, in the \"Annals of Iowa.\" We give the entire article : \"The river Des Moines has connected with its history many things of interest. It is purposed at this time to notice some of the historical events connected with this river since the land through which it passes was purchased by the Government from the Indians. \" On the first settlement of Iowa, the building of railroads had just com menced, and but very few in the West knew anything about this mode of con veyance for travel and commerce. At that time, steamboats for these purposes were the great absorbing idea. This river, in high stages of water, was thought to be susceptible of steamboat navigation far into the interior of the State, and those who first settled in the vicinity of this river eagerly looked forward to the day when steamboats would move up and down these waters in large numbers, and when from long distances from its banks, travel and com merce would seek a conveyance through this channel. And these expecta tions were apparently well-founded. In 1836, the Sacs and Foxes, having dis posed of their reservation on the Iowa River, where they had villages, moved West, and settled in the valley of the river Des Moines, in what is now Wapello County, and, as a natural consequence, trading-posts were established in this vicinity, which had to be supplied with goods; and in the fall of 1837, the few settlers along the banks of this river were, for the first time, gladdened with the sound of the shrill whistle of a steamboat, making its way up the river with supplies for these trading-posts. \"This boat was the S. B. Science, commanded by Capt. Clark, which, by forcing its way against the swift current, passing safely over the concealed sand-bars and hidden rocks, demonstrated that the waters of this river, at high stages, was navigable, much to the joy and satisfaction of those who lived in the vicinity, and afforded a themg for pleasant conversation for days and months. \"By the treaty of 1842, by which the Sacs and Foxes sold all their lands in Iowa, they were permitted to retain possession of that portion which lay west of Red Rock for three years, and the Indians moved up the river and located themselves near the Raccoon Fork, and the Government thought proper to locate a body of troops at that point ; and for the conveyance of soldiers and their equipage to that place, the little steamer lone was employed"], [409, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 417 and laden with stores, and a detachment of troops landed on the site where is now the city of Des Moines, on the 9th of May, 1843. This is the first steam boat that ever ventured to disturb the waters of this river so far from its mouth. The lone, having made a successful trip, added greatly to the expect ation of the estimated importance and value of this thoroughfare, which was brought to the attention of Congress, and on the 8th of August, 1846, a law was enacted giving to Iowa, for the purpose of aiding to improve the naviga tion of the river Des Moines from its mouth to the Raccoon Fork, an equal moiety in alternate sections of the public lands remaining unsold, in a strip five miles wide on each side of the river, to be selected within the territory of Iowa by an agent, or agents, who should be appointed by the Governor of the Territory, subject to the approval of the U. S. Treasury. \"When this grant was first made, it was not supposed by any one that it extended above Raccoon Fork, and Gov. Clark, in communicating the intelli gence to the Legislature, estimated the grant to amount to about three hundred thousand acres. This part of the Governor's message was referred to a select committee, for them to take into consideration whether it was advisable for the State to accept the grant, and if so, to devise the method of disposing of the lands and the mode of improving the river. \" The committee, after having the matter under consideration several weeks, through their Chairman, Dr. James Davis, of Wapello County, made a very lengthy report, in which they took the ground that the grant was not limited to lands below the Raccoon Fork, but extended to every alternate section for five miles on each side of the river to the northwestern boundary of the State, if not to the source of the river. They estimated the grant to contain 400, 000 acres below the Raccoon Fork, and 560,000 above, making 960,000 acres of land. The report of the committee at first was looked upon as visionary, and but very little calculation was made on getting any land above the fork of the river; but a matter of so much importance was not passed over without examination and full discussion. \" From this time on, for several years, the improvement of the river Des Moines entered largely into the politics of the State. Politicians became inter ested in it ; the construction put upon the grant by the committee was the popu lar side, and found many advocates, and scarcely any one opposed it. The committee reported in favor of receiving the grant, with provisos, and a bill for creating a Board of Public Works. On this report the Legislature passed an act accepting the grant, with a proviso that it was not to form a part of the 500,000 acres which the State was entitled to by an act of Congress of 1841, giving to each new State that amount of land for internal improvements. This was conceded by the General Government, and it also permitted the State to divert 500,000 acres from works of internal improvement to the purpose of education. The Legislature, on the 5th of February, 1847, also passed an act creating a Board of Public Works, and providing for the improvement of the river. The Board consisted of a President, Secretary and Treasurer, who were to.be elected by the qualified electors of the State, on the first Monday of the following August. The President was to be the active agent of the work, and was required to make monthly reports of his doings and of the progress of his work to the Board ; the Secretary was to record the proceedings of the Board and to sell the lands ; the Treasurer was to receive and disburse the moneys. The officers were required to commence the work on the Mississippi, near Keokuk, at the mouth of Dead Slough, or of the Nassau Slough, and then up the slough to the river. And subsequently the work was commenced by under-"], [410, "418 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. taking to dig a canal from the mouth of the Nassau Slough to St. Francisville, the first place on the river where it was thought practicable to build a dam. \" About $150,000 was expended in the effort, but the attempt proved to be an impracticable undertaking, and, after expending this large amount of money, the work of digging a canal was abandoned. At the August election, Hugh W. Sample, of Jefferson County, was elected President ; Charles Corckery, of Dubuque County, Secretary, and Paul Braton, of Van Buren County, Treas urer. The officers elected were qualified, and at first opened their offices at Fairfield. Samuel Curtis, from Ohio, was selected by the Board as Chief Engineer ; but there was very little done this season toward improving the river, further than making surveys. The necessary surveys having been com pleted, early in the spring of 1848, the work was commenced. The canal and three dams were put under contract, and about five hundred hands were put at work. On the 21st of August, the building of ten more dams was contracted for, and there seemed to be a fair prospect for the speedy completion of the entire improvement. \" There was at this time but very little known of the resources of the upper valley of the river Des Moines. This year, by authority of the United States, provisions were made for a geological survey in Iowa, and a party was sent up the river, which explored it to its source. The report made by this party was very flattering. They reported that coal was found for two hundred miles on the Des Moines, and from indications, heavy deposits of iron were believed to exist ; that gypsum in abundance, forming cliffs for miles, was encountered ; and that limestone, that makes a superior hydraulic lime, existed in abundance ; limestone, suitable for lime, clay suitable for brick, rock suitable for polishing, for grindstones, whetstones and for building purposes, some of superior quality, were found in abundance along the Des Moines. And Col. Curtis, in specu lating upon the future, in his report to the Legislature, led the people to anticipate great results from this improvement. He said : ' No country can afford like accommodations to manufacturers ; no country can produce more agricultural wealth than that within sixty miles on either side of this river.' And further : ' That, taking all things into consideration, the matter is math ematically certain (except in times of high water in the Missouri), the trade of Council Bluffs will incline to follow down the improvement. But it is not this point alone that is reached ; we enter the great valley of Nebraska, and the upper branches of the Missouri, and offer the commerce of these valleys the cheapest and most expeditious route for their products. A country of a thou sand miles extent, capable of furnishing vast and unknown agricultural and mineral products, may, by wise and discreet energy in the prosecution of this work, become tributary to the improvement now in progress on the Des Moines.' \" These glowing reports of the country and the advantages to be derived from the improvement of the river excited the public mind to the highest expectations, and the people became very anxious to secure as much of the public lands as possible, that this great undertaking might be spedily com pleted ; and to ascertain the construction put upon the grant by the General Government, application was made to the Land Department for a decision. Richard M. Young, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, on the 23d day of February, 1848, in a letter addressed to the Board of Public Works. gave it as his opinion that the State was entitled to the alternate sections within five miles of the Des Moines River, through the whole extent of Iowa. This decision gave assurances that the amount of land claimed would be received. The Board of Improvement made great preparation for rapidly push-"], [411, "419 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. ing on the work, and the public mind was exhilarated with the greatest hopes of speedily realizing the great advantages represented to be derived from this undertaking. \" But, as it is the lot of man to meet with disappointments, such seems to have been the result in this case ; for it was found that the lands could not be sold fast enough to meet the expenses of so extensive a work as had been undertaken. To remedy this difficulty, the Board of Public Works recom mended to the Legislature ' that bonds, bearing the sanction of the supreme power of the State, should be issued by the Board, and pledging the proceeds of the sales of the lands, as well as the tolls of the improvement, for their redemption. But this policy did not meet with the sanction of some of the lead ing Democrats of the State, who regarded such a measure as not being in accord ance with Democratic principles, among whom were Ver Plank Van Antwerp. Van Antwerp, having held the office of Receiver in the first land office estab lished in the Southern Iowa, and then holding the same office at Fairfield, and also, for awhile, editor of a paper, was extensively known, and at that time exerted much influence among the people, and he took a very active part against the proposition recommended by the Board. He claimed that the measure was not only Antidemocratic, but impolitic, and went to Iowa City as a lobby member, and made himself very busy with the members to defeat it ; and the opposition with which it met from Van Antwerp and other private individuals had its effect with the members of the Legislature, and the measure was defeated, much to the discomfiture of Sample. The interference of Van Antwerp with the recommendations of the Board created a coolness between Sample and Van Antwerp which caused some singular results in the future political matters of the State. \" During the summer of 1848, a portion of the land above the Raccoon Fork was brought into the market and offered for sale at the land office at Iowa City, and some of the lands which it was supposed were embraced within the river grant were sold by the General Government. The failure of the Board to get the Legislature to authorize them to issue bonds, and the selling of these lands by the General Government, greatly frustrated the plans of the Board and put a damper upon the public expectation. For the purpose of securing the full amount of land claimed, the Legislature passed a memorial asking Congress to enact an explanatory law confirming to the State the quantity of land claimed. But Congress did not feel disposed to do this, and the extent of the grant was a disputed question for several years. \" At the August election, in 1849, the officers of the Board of Public Works were to be again elected, and the old officers were desirous of holding on to their offices, and Sample made great efforts to have the old officers renominated by the State Convention for candidates before the people. Those who were in favor of issuing bonds for the speedy completion of the work were in favor of re-electing the old Board ; those who were against this measure were opposed to them. Among those who took an active part against the old Board was Van Antwerp, and his opposition was particularly made against Sample, which got up much ill-feeling between them. Van Antwerp, to accomplish his ends before the convening of the Convention, prepared a stricture on Sample's political acts. which ' showed him up ' in no very enviable light. Van Antwerp went to Iowa City, where the Convention was to be held, a short time before it convened, and had his strictures printed in handbill form, and on the morning of the Conven tion circulated copies all over the city, so that a copy found its way into the hands of every delegate. This had the effect to beat Sample and the other"], [412, "420 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. officers of the Board, and William Patterson, of Lee County, was nominated for President; Jesse Williams, of Johnston, for Secretary; and George Gillaspy, of Wapello, for Treasurer. \" These individuals were all elected, entered upon the duties of their trust, and with energy undertook to complete all the work which had been put under contract. But they soon found that they could not sell lands fast enough to meet their expenditures, and had to suspend a portion of the work. But they did not do this until they had contracted a large amount of debts, which they had not the means to pay. The new board, on making settlements with the contractors, not having the money to pay them, issued bonds or certificates of indebtedness, pledging the lands for their payment, and binding the Board to redeem them as soon as they had the means to do it. So the new Board, with out the sanction of law, did what the old Board had tried to get the Legislature to authorize them to do by law, and for which policy they were turned out of office and others put in their place. Those contractors who were stopped from going on with their work claimed damages ; legal proceedings were had and some of them recovered large amounts. \"The course pursued by the new Board met with much censure from the public and the newspapers ; particularly the Whig press was very severe in its strictures. The course which had been pursued by the Board of Public Works made the improvement of the river Des Moines a prominent matter before the Legislature, which convened in December, 1850. The issuing of bonds did not meet with the approval of that body, and a law was passed abolishing the offices of President, Secretary and Treasurer, and the offices of ' Commissioner and Register of the Des Moines River Improvement ' were created, which, instead of being elected by the people, were appointed by the Governor, by and with the consent of the Senate. \"As soon as the law abolishing the Board of Public Works went into effect. the Governor appointed Ver Plank Van Antwerp Commissioner, and George Gillaspy Register of the Imprevement, who, on the 9th of June, 1851, entered into a contract with Bangs Brothers & Co., of New York, in which they stip ulated to complete the whole work, from the mouth of the river to the Raccoon Fork, in four years from the time when for the improvement of the river a confirmation should be secured of the extension of the grant of land above that point. When the contract was closed, Bangs Brothers & Co. and the officers of the Improvement went to work and succeeded in getting the Land Department of the General Government to reconsider the decision in which it had been held that the grant of land only extended to the Raccoon Fork, and obtained a decision that it extended to the northern boundary of the State, which gave hopes that the river would soon be made navigable. On the first reception of the news, there was much rejoicing, but when the details of the contract with Bangs, Brothers & Co. were made public, it was found that the contract pro vided that the lands below the Raccoon Fork were not to be sold for less than $2.00 per acre, and those above for not less than $5.00. \" This gave great dissatisfaction, for a great portion of these lands was occupied by claimants who expected to buy their claims at $1.25 per acre, as others had done who had settled upon Government lands. This provision stirred up much ill-feeling among the settlers ; public meetings were held, and this part of the contract was condemned in the strongest terms ; and such were the feelings that there were apprehensions of serious difficulties if this part of the contract should be enforced. But when these excitements were at their highest, news came that Bangs Brothers & Co. had failed, and probably their"], [413, "BONAPARTE"], [414, ""], [415, "423 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. contract would be annulled, and this allayed the public feeling. Bangs Broth ers & Co. did not comply with their contract in furnishing means, and the work on the river did not go on, and the public expectation of a speedy completion of the proposed improvement vanished. \" The officers of the Improvement were appointed for only two years, and at the expiration of their term of office, Van Antwerp was re-appointed Com missioner, and Paul C. Jeffries was appointed Register. But these last appoint ed officers held their trust but a short time, for during the past two years the work on the river had progressed very slowly ; the contract with Bangs Broth ers & Co. had been declared forfeited, and it was understood that other sources were to be looked to for going on with the work. The officers appointed by the Governor not being successful in their undertaking, the Legislature, on the 1st of January, 1853, repealed the law authorizing the Governor to appoint, and made these officers again to be elected by the people, and on the first Monday in the following April, Josiah Bonney, of Van Buren County, was elected Commissioner, and George Gillaspy, Register. And, for the purpose of aiding the Commissioners in conducting and concluding any contract on the subject of improving the river, the Legislature appointed George G. Wright, of Van Buren County, and Uriah Biggs, of Wapello, his assistants, ' with equal powers of the Commissioner in making and determining such contract.' \"From past experience, it was not deemed advisable to parcel out the work to many individuals, and consequently these officers were required by the Legis lature not to make any contract, unless such contract stipulated for ' at least $1,300,000 to be faithfully expended in the payment of the debts and liabilities of the Improvement, and its completion to the greatest extent possible.' And to this end, if it was necessary, they were authorized ' to sell and dispose of all a~>d any lands which had been or might hereafter be granted by Congress for the improvement of the river, and, if it was necessary to effect a contract, they were authorized to convey the right to tolls and water rents arising from the Improvement, for the length of time and upon such terms as they might deem expedient. But in disposing of the lands, they were not to contract them for less than $1.25 per acre;' and if no contract of this character should be made before the 1st of September, 1853, then the pay of all the officers connected with the work, except the Register and one engineer, was to cease, and all operations connected with the work, except such parts as were under contract, were to be suspended until further action by the Legislature. The Register was required to put all unfinished work then under contract in such a condition as to prevent it from injury, and to see that all property of the State connected with the work was carefully preserved. If the Register, at any time subse quent, should receive propositions which he deemed sufficient for consideration, he was to submit the same to the Commissioner; and should a contract be made on the terms required by the Legislature, then the pay of the officers should commence and the work go on as though it had not been suspended. \" The new Commissioner, being conscientious about the expending of money, immediately after taking charge of the work, dismissed all the engineers, except Guy Wells, the chief engineer, and employed no officer or other persons, except when the necessity of the work imperatively demanded it. There were in several places of the river snags and bowlders, which much obstructed the navigation, and had become a source of much inconvenience and complaint; but during the official term of Bonney, the river was ' cleared of snags, bowlders and other obstructions to such an extent as to make the navigation of the river, at proper stages of the water, safe.'"], [416, "424 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. \" The Commissioner and his associates, after assuming the duties of their trust, entered into correspondence with such persons and companies as they thought likely to embark in such an enterprise. And by this means they suc- ceeded in eliciting the attention of capitalists to such an extent that a number of persons came to the State for the purpose of investigation. These persons, by an examination of the valley of the Des Moines personally, and making themselves acquainted with the resources of the country, on their return East, imparted to others the undeveloped wealth and advantages of the valley, which was the means of bringing many good and enterprising citizens to the State. Among others who visited Iowa for the purpose of investigation was Henry O'Rielly, a man who had acquired some considerable notoriety as a contractor in putting up telegraph wires, and he proposed to undertake the work. Such was the known reputation of O'Rielly as a contractor that the Commissioner and his associates commenced the negotiating of a contract. And 'on the 17th of December, 1853, Henry O'Rielly, Esq., of New York, entered into a con- tract with the Commissioners, in which, for the consideration of the unsold lands belonging to the Improvement, and tolls and water rents and other profits aris- ing from the work, for the term of forty years, agreed to complete the entire work within a period of four years from the 1st day of July, 1854, according to the original surveys and specifications made by the engineers.' \"Immediately upon entering upon this contract, O'Rielly returned East and organized a company, under the laws of Iowa, called the 'Des Moines Navi- gation & Railroad Company,' to which O'Rielly assigned his contract, himself being one of the officers of the Company. On the 9th of June, 1854, by the consent and request of O'Rielly, and with the approbation of the officers of the River Improvement, the contract with O'Rielly was canceled, and another con- tract was made with the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company. In this contract, the Company agreed to pay all outstanding debts against the Improve- ment within ninety days from the date of said contract, to settle and pay all damages against the State of Iowa, on account of the prosecution of said work, to mill-owners, or others who have, or might thereafter, sustain damages on account of the same; to pay the salaries and expenses of the officers and engineers in charge of the work ; to complete the Improvement from the mouth of the Des Moines River to Fort Des Moines, in accordance with the original plans and specifications of the State Engineer, by the 1st day of July, 1858 ; and to construct the whole work in such a manner as to assure the navigation of the same for the longest period each year practicable, and to complete at least one-fourth of the work each and every year, commencing on the 1st dav of July, 1854. \" In consideration of this understanding, the Commissioner agreed to con- vey to the Company all the unsold lands belonging to the Improvement, the use of the work, the tolls and water rents for the term of forty-one years. And after- ward, in consideration of the Company enlarging the works and making some other improvements in the navigation of the river, and also on account of there not being as large a quantity of land undisposed of below Fort Dodge as was understood to be by the Commissioners and the Company at the time of making the contract, a majority of the Commissioners, Bonney and Biggs, entered into an article of agreement with the Company, in which they promised to ex- tend the time of the Company's use and control of the work to seventy-five years. \" Under this contract, the public expected that the work would be immedi ately commenced by the new contractors and speedily completed. The great"], [417, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN \u00bb!UUNTY. 425 expectations which at first had been raised by the contractors, under the name of the ' Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company,' soon after they under took the work began to diminish ; for there soon arose disagreements and mis understandings among themselves. The Company had been organized under the general incorporation laws of Iowa, and, consequently, was subject to the laws of the State. At the called se-sion of the Legislature, in 1856, Donald Mann, a stockholder of the Company, memorialized the Legislature to correct the ' manifold abuses ' of which he charged the Directors of the Company to have been guilty. In this memorial, he charged that the managers of the Com pany had, in various ways, ' corruptly, and for corrupt purposes,' violated the laws of the State, ' greatly to the injury of the people thereof, and to the great loss and damage of the stockholders,' and showed in detail wherein they had acted corruptly and violated the laws under which the Company was incorporated. Among other things, he stated that, ' for the purpose of deceiving the people and individuals in relation to their means,' they had represented to the public and to individuals that there had been paid into the treasury ' enormous sums of money, on account of stock sold, for much larger amounts than had been received. And, the better to accomplish and maintain such deceptions, the Managers (or a majority of them) caused to be issued certificates of stock to the amount of, nominally, $630,000, or six thousand three hundred shares of $100, for cash, of which shares they had represented to the public and individ uals that the holder had paid the sum of $100, amounting to $630,000, when, as a matter of fact, there was only 5 per cent paid on each share, by which means the public and many individuals were deceived.' \" Henry O'Rielly, the individual with whom the contract had first been made, a stockholder and one of the Directors, also memorialized the Legislature for an investigation of the affairs of the Company, in which he re-asserted the charges made by Mann, and stated that he held himself ready, if the Legisla ture would order an investigation of the doings of the Company, to prove, from the records of the Company and from other evidence, ' that there was scarcely an important provision in the code of Iowa (applicable to corporations), scarcely an important point in the Des Moines Improvement laws, scarcely an important pro vision in the contract which the Company agreed to fulfill, scarcely an essential provision in its by-laws, or even in the charter which gave it legal existence, which had not been violated, and violated with a recklessness that will form a memorable feature in the history of Iowa.' \" A joint committee was appointed from both branches of the Legislature, at the called session, to investigate the alleged abuses ; but, owing to the short time in which they had to act, it was impossible fof them to make the necessary investigation. An attempt was made to create a committee for this purpose to act after the Legislature adjourned ; but this failed, so that the alleged abuses passed by without examination at that time. These memorials to the Legisla ture and the discussion of these matters by the newspapers greatly prejudiced the public mind against the Company ; and while these discussions were going on, W. C. Johnson, the President of the Company, requested the Governor to examine into its affairs, in person or by committee, and proposed to pay the expenses of such an examination. The Governor did not feel disposed to com ply with the request, but referred the matter to the Legislature, which convened the following December, and recommended that a committee should be appointed with power to administer oaths, and to send for persons and papers, with instruc tions to inquire into all the transactions of the former Commissioners and Reg isters of the Improvement."], [418, "426 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. \" This part of the Governor's message was referred to a committee of twelve, consisting of members of both branches of the Legislature, who immediately proceeded to the discharge of their duties. After a careful and thorough exam ination, this committee reported that they did not consider the contract made by the Commissioners with the Company a valid contract on behalf of the State, for the law which authorized the Commissioner and Register to make contracts required that any contract made by them, to be valid, must be approved by the Governor, and that the subsequent law, which created two Assistant Com missioners, did not do away with the provision requiring the Governor to approve of such contracts. And, as the contract made with the Company had never been approved by the Governor, they did not regard it as binding on the State. The Committee also reported that the Company had acted in bad faith, and violated their charter in many ways ; and, among other things, they found that over $1,000,000 of full-paid stock had been issued by the Company, upon which had been received but $167,000, leaving a deficit of $833,000, for which certificates of full-paid stock had been issued, for which not a farthing had been received by the Company, which had been sold to innocent purchasers for a valuable consideration, who had purchased, believing its full value had been paid into the treasury of the Company. The Company had come far short of completing the amount of work which they were required to do under their contract, and their acts gave strong indications that their object was to expend money enough to get possession of all the available lands, and then abandon the work ; for more than one-half of the time which was given for completing the entire contract had expired, and on a work which was estimated to cost about $2,000,000 they had expended about $185,957.44 for an actual construction of the work, while the Company claimed that they had expended $104,180.74 for incidental expenses, the most part of which did not, in any manner, benefit the Improvement. Yet the Company claimed that they were entitled to land at $1.25 per acre in payment for the whole amount. \" On the 2d of April, 1855, William McKay, of Polk County, was elected Commissioner, and John C. Lockwood, of Louisa County, Register ; but in November, 1856, McKay resigned, and Edwin Manning, of Van Buren County, was appointed by the Governor to fill his place. Manning bore the name of a good business man and a close financier, and he was not willing to audit the claims for incidental expenses, as one for which the Company were entitled to receive land ; and this became a matter of dispute between the Com pany and Commissioner, and, in order to have the matter adjusted, the Presi dent proposed to make an abatement of $72,000 ; but Manning did not feel disposed to settle the matter himself, and referred the whole claim to the Legis lature. \" Manning, in his report to the Legislature, showed that there had been sold by the State, through the Board of Public Works, during the six years that the State prosecuted the work, about $75,000 worth of land ; and for this sum only ' three stone-masonry locks ' and two dams had been completed ; and there had been certified to the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company, by Bon ney and Gillaspy, 88,853 19-100 acres of land, and by McKay and Lockwood, 116,636 4-100 acres, at $1.25 per acre, making $256,861.53 worth of land, which had been disposed of to the present Company, a part of which amount was for old debts which they had paid. \" The report of the Committee and Commissioner having been made to the Legislature, that body, acting upon the premises that the contract which had been made by the Commissioners with the Company was not binding upon the"], [419, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 427 State, on the 29th of January, 1857, passed an act by which there was to be a Commissioner appointed by the Governor, who, with the regular Commissioner, was authorized to contract for the speedy prosecution of the work, and it was made their duty to ascertain and pay off all just claims against the Improve ment ; and they were authorized to contract with any company for the sale of all lands, tolls and water rents who would give satisfactory evidence and security for the completion of the Improvement. But they were not to bind the State by any contract further than the appropriation of the land and the income of the Improvement ; and no contract made by the Commissioners was to be valid until approved by the Governor. And by this act, the offices of Register and Assistant Commissioner were abolished, and the Register was required to deliver over to the State Land Office all books and papers in his office; and the Reg ister of the State Land Office was required to perform all the duties which the Register of the Improvement had done. And by thus doing, the Legislature gave the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company to understand that they did not regard the contract made by them with the Commissioners as binding upon the State, though by this act they made arrangements for auditing their claims and paying them their just dues. About this time, the question was brought up in the Land Department at Washington, as to the extent of this grant of land, and the opinion was made public that the original intention of Congress was to only give to the State the lands below the Raccoon Fork ; but a disposition was manifested to compromise by the department recognizing as being in the grant all lands adjacent to the river within the State. But assumptions had heretofore met with success, and now those interested in the land-grant claimed and contended that this grant embraced all the lands to the source of the river. This difficulty about the extent of the land-grant, together with the action of the Legislature, nearly suspended all operations on the river, and much was said by the Company about enforcing their claims by law. \"The Commissioners appointed to audit and pay the claims against the Improvement did not succeed in adjusting the claims of the Company, and the matter was again referred to the Legislature; and, on the 22d of March, 1858, there was a joint resolution passed by the Legislature, defining the basis upon which the State would settle, and the Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company was given sixty days to consider whether they would accept of and ratify this proposition ; and if they did not, within that time, then it was made the duty of the Governor to enjoin them from further proceeding with the work of the Improvement. Also, on the same day of adopting this resolution, there was an act passed giving all the lands which remained after settling with this Company, 'and also all the stone, timber and other materials turned over to the State by the Company,' to the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Rail road Company, for the purpose of constructing a railroad from Keokuk up the Des Moines Valley, to the northern line of the State, except the material which it might be necessary to use for the completion of the locks and dams at Cro ton, Plymouth, Bentonsport and Keosauqua, which the Railroad Company were to complete ; and also, all debts which grew out of the Improvement, which at that time remained unsatisfied, or were, in some manner, provided for. But in this grant there was a provision made that it should not, in any manner, con flict with the lands which had, previous to that time, been given to the State by Congress for railroad purposes, which, on the 15th of July, 1856, had been given by the Legislature to the companies formed to build the four roads desig nated by the grant. But it was understood that these lands, having been"], [420, "428 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. donated by Congress for the improvement of the navigation of the river Des Moines, could not be diverted to the building of a railroad without the consent of Congress, and measures were immediately taken to get Congress to sanction the diversion ; but this attempt failed, so that the action of the Iowa Legisla ture did not avail the Railroad Company anything that session. The Railroad Company determined to make another effort at the next session of Congress ; but before the time for this effort, another difficulty arose in the way of obtain ing the lands for the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad Com pany- . . \"Insetting up the claims that the grants for improving the river Des Moines extended above the Raccoon Fork, the citizens of Iowa were united until after the grant of lands by Congress for railroad purposes was made. After this, the railroad companies became interested in the lands claimed for the River Improvement, and claimed that the grant did not embrace any lands above the Raccoon Fork, on which the citizens of Iowa were now divided, and both sides of the question were represented. Upon this phase of the case, the officer of the Land Department at Washington had but very little hesita tion in deciding against the claims of the River Improvement. After this decision was made, the legal tribunals were resorted to, and a case was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the same decision was given as in the Land Office. \" On the 3d of March, 1860, there was an act passed abolishing the office of Commissioner of the Des Moines River Improvement, and George G. Wright, Edward Johnson and Christian W. Slagle were appointed a Board of Commis sioners for the purpose of ascertaining all the liabilities against the Des Moines River Improvement, and against the State of Iowa, growing out of the Im provement. They were required to meet at Keosauqua, and were clothed with power similar to the District Court, to hear ami determine all claims growing out of the Improvement, and were authorized to sell all the interests of the State, and all dams and improvements, and the lands appertaining thereto. These Commissioners proceeded with their duties, and with their labors closed all official acts, as far as the State was concerned, in applying the proceeds of this land grant toward the improvement of the navigation of the river Des Moines. * \" This was a most magnificent grant, embracing some of the best lands in the State ; and if the proceeds had been judiciously and properly expended, would have made a great thoroughfare for steamboats, besides affording an immense water-power for driving machinery. But, through the incompetency of managing the means, and the intrigues of designing men, the whole of the lands below the Raccoon Fork, and a large quantity above, were disposed of, and very little practical good accomplished toward the navigation of the river.\" ORIGIN OF THE NAME DES MOINES. In Nicollet's \" Report of the Upper Mississippi River,\" made to Congress, February 16, 1841, and published in 1843, he gives the following account of the origin of the name of the Des Moines River : \" The Des Moines is one of the most beautiful and important tributaries of the Mississippi, north of the Missouri ; and the metamorphosis which its name has undergone from its original appellation is curious enough to be recorded."], [421, "429 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. \" We are informed that Father Marquette and M. Joliet, during their voy age in search of the Mississippi, having reached the distance of sixty leagues below the mouth of the Wisconsin, observed the footprints of men on the right side of the great river, which served as a guide to those two celebrated explorers to the discovery of an Indian trail, or path, leading to an extensive prairie, and which they determined to follow. Having proceeded about two leagues, they first saw one village on the bank of the river, and then two others upon the slope, half a league from the first. The travelers, having halted within hailing distance, were met by the Indians, who offered them their hospitalities, and represented themselves as belonging to the Illinois nation. \" The name which they gave their settlement was Moningouinas (or Moin gona, as laid down in the ancient maps of the country), and is a corruption of the Algonquin word, Mikouang, signifying at the road, by their customary elliptical manner of designating localities, alluding, in this instance, to the well-known road in this section of the country whieh they used to follow as a communication between the head of the lower rapids and their settlement on the river which empties itself into the Misssisippi, to avoid the rapids ; and this is still the practice of the present inhabitants of the country. \"Now, after the French had established themselves on the Mississippi, they adopted this name ; but with their custom (to this day also that of the Creoles) of only pronouncing the first syllable, and applying it to the river as well as to the Indians who dwelt upon it \u2014 so they would say, ' la riviere des Moines ' (the river of the Moines) : ' allez chez les Moines ' (to go to the Moines people). But in latter times the inhabitants associated this name with that of the Trap - pist Monks (Moines de la Trappe), who resided with the Indians of the Amer ican Bottom. \" It was then concluded that the true reading of the riviere des Moines was the '\u2022riviere des Moines,' or river of Monks, by which name it is designated on all the modern maps. The Sioux, or Ndakotah Indians, call the Des Moines Inyan-sha-sha-watpa, or Redstone River, from inyan, stone; sha-sha, redupli cation of sha, red ; and watpa, river. They call the upper east fork Inyan shu sha-watpa-sunkaku, the Brother of the Redstone River.\" WAR RECORD. If there is any one thing more than another of which the people of the Northern States have reason to be proud, it is of the record they made during the dark and bloody days when red-handed rebellion raised its hideous head and threatened the life of the nation. When the war was forced upon the country, the people were quietly pursuing the even tenor of their ways, doing whatever their hands found to do \u2014 working the mines, making farms or culti vating those already made, erecting houses, founding cities and towns, building shops and manufactories \u2014 in short, the country was alive with industry and hopes for the future. The people were just recovering from the depression and losses incident to the financial panic of 1857. The future looked bright and promising, and the industrious and patriotic sons and daughters of the Free States were buoyant with hope, looking forward to the perfecting of new plans for the insurement of comfort and competence in their declining years ; they little heeded the mutterings and threatenings of treason's children in the Slave States of the South. True sons and descendants of the heroes of the \"times that tried men's souls\" \u2014 the struggle for American Independence \u2014 they never"], [422, "430 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. dreamed that there was even one so base as to dare attempt the destruction of the Union of their fathers \u2014 a government baptized with the best blood the world ever knew. While immediately surrounded with peace and tranquillity, thev paid but little attention to the rumored plots and plans of those who lived and grew rich from the sweat and toil, blood and flesh, of others \u2014 aye, even trafficking in the offspring of their own loins. Nevertheless, the war came, with all its attendant horrors. April 12, 1861, Fort Sumter, at Charleston, South Carolina, Maj. Ander son, U. S. A., Commandant, was fired on by rebels in arms. Although basest treason, this first act in the bloody reality that followed was looked upon as the mere bravado of a few hot-heads \u2014 the act of a few fire-eaters whose sectional bias and hatred was crazed by the excessive indulgence in intoxicating pota tions. When, a day later, the news was borne along the telegraph wires that Maj. Anderson had been forced to surrender to what had first been regarded as a drunken mob, the patriotic people of the North were startled from their dreams of the future, from undertakings half completed, and made to realize that behind that mob there was a dark, deep and well-organized purpose to destroy the Government, rend the Union in twain, and out of its ruins erect a slave oligarchy, wherein no one should dare to question their right to hold in bondage the sons and daughters of men whose skins were black, or who, perchance, through practices of lustful natures, were half or quarter removed from the color that God, for His own purposes, had given them. But they \"reckoned without their host.\" Their dreams of the future, their plans for the establish ment of an independent confederacy, were doomed from their inception to sad and bitter disappointment. When the Southern rebels fired upon Fort Sumter, it found this vast North unarmed, untrained in the art of war, and in a state of such profound peace as to warrant the belief that hostilities could not be cegun by those who had, since the foundation of this Union, boasted loudly of their loyalty to the Con stitution of the United States. The rumors of disaffection that had alarmed the more watchful had aroused but trifling fears in the breasts of the great mass of Northern citizens. War between the States had, prior to that time, been deemed an impossibility. The sentiments of fraternal unity were so deep abiding in the hearts of the North, that treason was regarded as an improbable crime, and overt acts of antagonism to the Government too base in their intent to be worthy of serious consideration. But the hand of the aged Ruffin, as he laid the blazing torch upon the gun within Stevens' battery, lighted a flame which spread throughout the land with electric rapidity, and illumined the nation with a glare that revealed the truth of rebel threats. The boom of that first gun awakened the passive people to the dread reality of their position. From Maine to Oregon, from Superior to the Ohio, the country arose, as with a single impulse, to respond to the demands of the hour. There was no need of prompting them, no need of canvassing for strength, no hesitating as to measures, no thought of compromise. But one course could be pursued, and that the people comprehended as though inspired by some higher mentor. The Union must be preserved. Each individual member of society felt the urgent necessity of prompt and concerted action. Towns did not wait to hear tidings from sister towns ; each heard in the roar of brave old Sumter s guns a summons direct, imperative and irresistible, for aid in the defense of the nation's honor. Rivals in business and in politics grasped each other's hands and hurried forth, side by side, rivals no longer, save in their eagerness to enroll first their names upon the list of citizen-soldiery."], [423, "431 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Almost simultaneous with the news of the attack upon Sumter, came the call from President Lincoln for troops. In the remote towns and rural localities, where telegraphic communication had not then penetrated, the appeal and the response were recorded at the same time. On the 15th of April, the President issued his call for 75,000 ninety-days troops. The State of Iowa was particularly fortunate in having as its Chief Executive Samuel J. Kirkwood, whose loyalty and unceasing devotion to the cause of the Union have embalmed his name forever in the annals of the State. Within thirty days after the President's demand was made public, Iowa had a regiment in the field. If it was within the province of this work to relate the story of Van Buren's loyalty, the limits of this volume would be extended far beyond those anticipated by the publishers. Some future historian, we have no doubt, will find a fruit ful topic in this record of war, and lay before the people of this county a narra tive of unsurpassed interest. Surely the opportunity exists and awaits the patient labors of a competent writer. The county lay so near the line of the Slave States that party feeling ran high throughout all the war. Local agitations were frequent over rumored invasions. The loyalty of the county was all the more marked because of the hazard of entertaining such sentiments. The long list of brave men who formed the volunteer companies from Van Buren is here appended : VOLUNTEER ROSTER. TAKEN PRINCIPALLY FROM ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORTS.

The population under the several census enumerations was as follows : 1838, 3,174 ; 1840, 6,166 ; 1844, 9,019 ; 1846, 9,870 ; 1847, 10,203 ; 1849, 11, 577; 1850,12,269; 1851,13,000; 1854,13,843; 1856,15,921; 1860,17, 081; in 1863, the war made a perceptible decrease, the population being reduced to 15,862 ; 1870, 17,672 ; 1875, 16,980. The church statistics for 1876 showed 8 pastoral charges ; 1,296 members ; 24 church-buildings ; 5 Sunday schools and 1,400 scholars ; and $41,800 worth of property. EDUCATIONAL. While the question of how to get a living was the foremost one in the minds of the pioneers, the less direct though none the less important one of how to educate their children was not overlooked. Almost cotemporaneous with their own dwellings, they began the building of such schoolhouses as they could, crude and primitive in the extreme, for such only would their appliances admit. and put together without regard to externals. These same pioneer schoolhouses will, in the future, be a theme for the artist \u2014 quite equal in every way to those supplied by the peasantry in the old world \u2014 with their quaint, simple fashions and unperverted lives. The eye of the connoisseur delights in those realistic representations of still life \u2014 the white haired old grandfather, whose toil of years has only brought him his cottage and bit of land; the still hard-working \" gude wife,\" with bent body and withered but cheerful old lace ; the next generation just in the prime of labor. rough, uncouth, and content to have for recreation a pipe and a mug of ale ; and the children, with rosy cheeks and stout limbs, dressed in veritable costumes their grandmothers wore before them. And no wonder such a picture pleases and charms the jaded senses of the worn-out worldling. But even that is not more fresh and unaccustomed than this log shanty, with its one small room, a window of but few panes of glass, and possibly a dirt floor ; and with rough hewn benches ranged round the walls for seats, over which the pupil made a fine gymnastic flourish whenever he felt it necessary to reach his teacher, with his forefinger firmly planted on the knotty word or sum that puzzled him. These are the picturesque features for the artist's pencil. And what \" learn ing \" there was, must have been a \" dangerous thing,\" for it was certainly \" little ; \" the grading was far from exact ; the system was a kind of hit-or-miss affair; but, nevertheless, it was \"school,\" and from the first there was a deeply rooted prejudice among the Iowa settlers in favor of schools. School for week days and a meeting-house for Sunday ! this same little pen of a house served two purposes. And could anything except the groves themselves \u2014 \" God's first temples \" \u2014 be nearer to nature as a tabernacle than was this, where some chance circuit preacher would have for his congregation every man, woman and child in the entire settlement? None of those hypercritical listeners there, you may be sure, who gauge the preacher by his \" intellectuality,\" his \" magnetism \" or his \"culture.\" It was the Word preached \u2014 welcome, pure and life-giving always \u2014 and not the preacher, which these listeners crowded to hear. If he but had the good Methodist zeal, then he was sure of devout hearers. He did not need to have \" traveled,\" except upon his lone circuit over the prairie ; nor did he feel it necessary to use his pulpit in the interests of politics\u2014 if he knew his Bible he was qualified ; nor did his flock feel called upon to put their hands"], [449, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 457 into their pockets and contribute toward sending their Pastor on a summer vacation to the sea-side or to Europe. All these improvements have come in with better churches and more advanced ways of thinking. That was the old way, and a direct contrast to the new. Now, nothing which the architect's taste can devise is too good for school house or for church. Look at the plenitude of tidy, commodious buildings in every county, and not designed for double service, either, but dedicated solely to the use of the schoolma'am, who hereabouts is thoroughly skilled in her pro fession. She has had, aside from such education as her means have enabled her to obtain, good, practical drill in the normal institutes. She not only knows her text-books, but she knows how to teach. And then, the ingeniously devised school-books, in which every point of information is adjusted to such a nicety that they are rather works of art and books of entertainment than but the dull means to a desired end. The little flocks of children who run along the country roads in their bare feet and sun-bonnets, and chip hats, do not have to squirm and twist their uneasy legs all day over a page in the English reader which they cannot under stand. They begin their morning's work with a chorus, which puts them all in good humor to start with. Then they come to timed classes, at the tinkle of the bell ; they are entertained and diverted as well as instructed at every step. Before there is any possibility of restlessness, they go through a five-minutes round of calisthenics, which puts a wholesome quietus upon their muscles and their mischief. Wise play is so mixed with teaching that they never really dis cover which is which until they find themselves ready to teach school them- selves in turn. This is the ease of the present compared with the labor of the past. And in this way is the generality of education secured. The ways are smoothed, the tediousness beguiled and the deprivation supplanted by an affluence of aids. In 1854, Gov. Grimes, in his inaugural message, said : \" The safety and perpetuity of our Republican institutions depend upon the diffusion of intelli gence among the masses of the people. The statistics of the penitentiaries and alms-houses throughout the country show that education is the best preventive of crime. They show, also, that the prevention of these evils is much less expensive than the punishment of the one and the relief of the other.\" So, with all our new-fangled methods, our ornamental, well-ventilated and well-furnished schoolhouses, our accomplished instructors with modern notions, we are not extravagant. We are simply taking from the expenses of crime and pauperism and putting it into enduring and beautiful shape. We are helping to sustain the Government by rearing up in every town and in every country neighborhood a generation of enlightened and intelligent people, cosmopolitan in the sense of schools, if not in that \"wider cosmopolitanism which comes alone from actual contact with the great world.

The most interesting contest over an election which has ever transpired in this region is that of the Miller-Thompson case. The peculiar character of the circumstances attending the affair, which can never be reproduced in this State, and the closeness of the vote, as well as the bitterness of party feeling at the time, conspire to render this case an exceedingly entertaining topic for intro- duction here. It is not the purpose of this sketch to indulge in strictures upon the methods employed by either faction, but it is designed to give as impartial a statement of the matter as careful research enables us to do. The heat of the contest has long since passed away, and we have no doubt that the survivors of the fight will read this chapter with a feeling of enjoyment, as it revives recol- lections of the days gone by. The authorities from which these facts are gatlV ered are perfectly reliable, being the official documents of Monroe County (examined expressly for the purpose), numerous files of the leading journals of the time, among which are the Des Moines Courier and the Burlington Hawk- Eye, and personal interviews with some of the most prominent men connected with the affair. The contest arose over the alleged election of William Thompson to a seat in the Thirty-first Congress. In 1848, the candidates for the honor of represent- ing the southern half, or First District, of Iowa, were William Thompson (Dem- ocrat), of Mt. Pleasant, and Daniel F. Miller (Whig), of Fort Madison. The election was held on August 7."], [451, "459 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. In 1848, the Democratic managers were greatly agitated over the apparent growth of Whig sentiments in this district. The eastern counties were fast becoming uncertain territory, and some expedient was essential to the life and prosperity of the party. The leading spirits among the .Democrats were men of fertile resources, thoroughly posted in the ways of politics, and full of shrewd energy. A plan presented itself to their inventive minds, nor were they slow to avail themselves of it. The machinery of the party was set to work at once to secure the needed strength so opportunely, but accidentally, proffered them, as they sincerely believed. It is necessary to revert to historic events of an earlier date, and in other localities, to explain the proceedings recorded hereafter. The Mormons, who figure conspicuously in this chapter, had suffered overthrow in their stronghold at Nauvoo, 111., in 1846. The misdeeds of the leader, Joseph Smith, had resulted in the violent death of that head of the sect, and the ascension to power of Brigham Young. The latter saint and ruler had decreed that the society should separate into numerous bands and travel westward in search of freedom. The exodus of the Latter-day Saints began in the year 1846. Iowa was the scene of unwonted activity occasioned by the flight of the refugees from the law. Some bands moved through the State on the line of the forty- second parallel: some went through the southern tier of counties, and some passed over the territory now composing the range in which Monroe is located. The ultimate destination of all these parties was Kanesville, or what is now known as Council Bluffs. Many of the Mormons did not reach the river in 1846, nor even in 1847. Hundreds camped in Marshall County during that year, and scores of the poor wretches died from actual starvation. Women were confined in the open country during the long, cold season, and filled unmarked graves. The suffering of those people in camp, during the winter of 1846-47, will never be described by human agency, and can be but faintly realized by the comfortably sheltered readers of this brief sketch. This chapter, however, has to deal with but one division of the Mormon party. Those who passed through this tier of counties reached Lucas County in the winter of 1846-47, and located a few miles southeast of the present town of Chariton. There rude huts were erected, and the party sojourned for several months. Subsequently, they passed on to the Missouri River, where they also tarried for a time. They were the first white \"settlers\" in Lucas County. A portion of the band of Mormons did not remain in Lucas that year, but pushed westward in hopes of gaining the place of rendezvous, designated by Young. Their hopes were blighted, however, for the weather was so inclement that they could not proceed. They did not reach a point beyond Clarke County. Three men, John Conyer, James and John Longley, became separated from the party and lost their way. They concluded to encamp for the winter (of 1846-47) where they were, and constructed a log hut. In this they lived, and attached to it the name of \"Lost Camp,\" a title by which the locality is \u2022 still known and pointed out. In the spring, these men found other Mormons but a few miles from them, in the same county. The village of Kanesville became the headquarters of the faithful to the creed of the Golden Book, and was the resting-place of the weary bands. There they recruited their wasted forces, and prepared to encounter fresh terrors in the slow march across the plains to Salt Lake City. It was thus that the year 1848 found a settlement of white men in the ter ritory supposed to be attached to Monroe County for election and judicial pur-"], [452, "460 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. poses, and it was by virtue of their forced residence in Iowa that the Mormons became, under the general statutes, legal voters in the State. Had it not been for the expulsion of the saints from Nauvoo and the unusually early winter which followed their exodus ; or, had it not been for the accident of circum stances, this somewhat singular history could not now be written. At the time of the occurrence of the events written above, the county of Monroe was composed of all the territory from the west line of Wapello County to the Missouri River. The unorganized counties of Lucas and Clarke were at that time defined in a manner preliminary to permanent establishment, the latter, however, being entirely unsettled by white men. The former contained not more than eight or ten families. The August election, 1848, was an important one to the people of Southern Iowa, as has already been observed. The office of Representative in Congress was to be filled, and the two parties in contest, Democrats and Whigs, were violent in their determination to win the prize. The Whigs were gaining strength, and it was all-essential that the county of Monroe, then a Democratic region, should give a large majority to overcome the Eastern vote. The investigation of old records impresses one with the fact that politicians of the old school, in the early days, were intensely shrewd ; possibly no more so than those of to-day, but the methods of working were very different then, and it may be that the apparent boldness was the result of a lack of means to \"cover up the tracks.\" At all events, it seems to one who carefully looks at the matter that more summary ways and means were then in vogue than could be successfully employed now. The opposing factions in 1848 were exceedingly jealous of one another. Every possible opportunity was improved to win the day. Because of this vig ilance, perhaps, the Argus-eyed Democracy discovered a grand chance to effect the defeat of their hated rival. The Mormon vote was not only desirable, but was available ! Happy thought ! Golden possibility ! Who first conceived the plan of wheeling the Mormons into line is not clearly established. Judge Mason, J. C. Hall, and, possibly, a well-known jurist, who still lives in Wapello County, might have been the authors of the shrewd scheme ; but that is immaterial. In 1847, the region lying upon the Missouri River, in a line supposed to be due west of Wapello County, was thickly inhabited, for so westerly a point, thanks to the Mormon colony, and naturally asserted its right of independence. A party of representative men came east and waited upon influential men at Iowa City, when the scheme was discussed. Gen. Dodge became much inter ested in the matter, foreseeing the possible strength such an organization might bring them. Nothing was then done, however, to effect the formation of the county, but the Democrats did not lose sight of the tide of Mormons moving westward, and halting for breath on the shores of the river. In Nauvoo, the Mormon vote had been a powerful ally to the Democrats at general elections, and a continuance of their support yvas both desirable and reasonable, according to the logic of Gen. Dodge. The organization of the new county rested with Judge Carleton, of the then Fourth Judicial District, and there is evidence which warrants the belief that the Judge counseled with the General in this matter. As early as 1847, the Whigs claimed to know to a certainty that the Mor mons were weakening in their political affinities, and the young party was not backward in aiding a change of belief in its own favor. Elder Orson Hyde was in command of the refugees, and his will was practically a law unto them."], [453, "461 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Col. Warren, in a speech delivered in Burlington, in September, 1848, after the election had been held, made what the Hawk- Eye termed a full explanation of the affair, and from that address is gathered a portion of the data relative to this part of our sketch. The time elapsed by which it was necessary to create a new county at the river, prior to the election of 1848, but there still remained an opportunity to form a polling precinct there and thus secure the vote. The only question to be decided was that of the political complexion of the district. If the Demo crats could be assured of support, the necessary formalities would be proceeded with at once. Now ensued a sharp encounter of wits. Gen. Dodge felt that he held the key to the situation, since through him alone could the desired organization be compassed. The Whigs, on the other hand, apprised themselves of the fact that the Mormons were becoming anxious to show their ill-will toward the Demo cratic party, as a means of avenging themselves for their expulsion from Nauvoo. Messengers were dispatched from both camps to feel the pulse of the people in the West, and each faction returned bearing metaphorical bunches of huge grapes, while their reports were that the land flowed with oil and honey for their respective candidates. In all this bartering there was evidently an under standing between the Whigs and the Mormons ; for a flat refusal on the part of the latter to vote the Democratic ticket would certainly have prevented their voting at all. The powers that were had to be mollified, and a go-between was found to represent to the Democrats the solidity of the Pottuwattamie precinct. When the character of the vote was satisfactorily determined, there still remained the question of its legality. If the territory lay west of the last organized county, which was then Monroe, that county had the power to create a precinct. If it did not, then there was an opportunity to contest the validity of returns from the river precinct. The Democrats believed that Kanesville, as the Mormon settlement was called, did lie within the legal territory of Monroe, but a survey was deemed necessary to settle the point. In accordance with that idea, a party was engaged to ascertain the geographical whereabouts of the vil lage, and a random line was run. Subsequent surveys have shown that the line was, indeed a random one, but that point did not come up in the contest which followed. For all practical purposes, the place lay west of Monroe. In the decision of this question, the Whigs wisely submitted to the Democrats, and the work of establishing the locality was performed by such means as the Democrats could, under no circumstances, thereafter dispute. It was highly important for the Democrats to locate Kanesville in Monroe territory, because Monroe was then Democratic, and they feared that the Whigs would oppose the organization of so strong a precinct, if they had it in their power so to do. The Whigs, meanwhile, confident of the victory they were to win, offered no objections to the formation of the precinct, but seemed quiescent in the matter. On the 3d of July, 1848, the Monroe County Commissioners issued the follow ing order : Ordered, by said Board, that that portion of country called Pottawattamie County, which lies directly west of Monroe County, be organized into a township, and that Kanesville be a precinct for election purposes in said township, and that the election be held at the Council House in said village; and that Charles Bird, Henry Miller and William Huntington be appoiated Judges of said election ; and that the boundaries of said township extend east as far as the East Nish-na-bat-na."], [454, "462 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. This public announcement of the plan warned the Whigs to work. Greek met Greek. It was known that the Board, then consisting of Andrew Elswick, William McBride and George R. Holliday, and Dudley C. Barber as Clerk, was Democratic. The latter officer made out the poll-books and sent them to the new precinct. Both parties sought the field of battle, and, for a time, the Mormon element became the favorites of the politicians, since they held the balance of power. The Mormons at home in Nauvoo were Democratic in sen timent, it was argued, and the Democrats were confident of their co-operation in the time of need. The election took place on the 7th day of August. To the consternation of the Democrats and the joy of the Whigs, the vote of the new precinct was cast almost solidly for Daniel F. Miller, the Whig candidate, and the Democratic candidate, William Thompson, was left out in the cold. No sooner was the result of the election made known, than the Democratic leaders took counsel, one with 'another, what to do. J. C. Hall went to Albia from Mt. Pleasant, and it is asserted that he and others advised the rejection of the poll-books. The messenger with the returns arrived in Albia, and the can vass of the votes was held on the 14th day of August. Dudley C. Barber, as Clerk of the Board, had a deciding voice in the matter. The canvass was made at his log cabin, one of the three or four buildings then standing on the town plat Among the prominent men at Albia at that time, was Dr. Flint, who sub sequently removed to Wapello County, and there became County Judge, and also State Senator from that county. He was brother-in-law to Barber, the Clerk who made out the poll-books, and who was authorized to pass upon their acceptance for canvass. Dr. Flint exercised a strong influence over Barber, and was an intense partisan. He urged the arbitrary rejection of the books. The little cabin was filled with excited men, and the canvass could not proceed. Among the Democrats were Mr. Hall and Israel Kister, of Davis County, who subsequently was elected State Treasurer on that ticket. The Whigs were determined to see the Pottawattamie vote counted, since they had beaten the Democrats at what they considered their own game. Among those men was Mr. Mark, who was Postmaster at Albia at a later date. He stood directly behind Barber when the latter decided to reject the books. Mr. Mark inquired : \" Do you really intend to reject the returns made out on poll-books pre pared by yourself, and in legal form, Mr. Barber ? \" \" Yes, sir, I do ! \" responded the Clerk. At this juncture, further examination of the books was to be made, when the disputed volumes could not be found. Search was instituted and vigorously prosecuted, but to no effect. The books were gone from the table where they had lain but a moment before. It was announced that the books had been stolen, and could not, therefore, be used as returns. It is reported by an eye-witness of the scene that pistols were drawn and a general riot seemed imminent ; but no serious outbreak followed the coup d'etat of the Democrats. Of course it was clear that the Whigs had not stolen the books, since it was for their interest to retain them. It rested, consequently, with the opposing faction to explain the mysterious disappearance of the docu ments. The evening of that day, Barber called to his aid two Justices, and, it is said, with locked doors, made a canvass of the vote of Monroe, throwing out the vote from Pottawattamie entirely. This rejection of the western vote"], [455, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 463 secured the election of Thompson, and he accordingly took his seat in the first session of the Thirty-first Congress. If we may be allowed to parody a classic quotation, uneasy sits the Con gressman who is not soundly elected ! No sooner was he there than the Whigs made an effort to oust him. The case was laid before a proper committee, and voluminous discussion ensued. Finally, the case was remanded to the District Court at Keokuk. Before a decision could be reached, an election took place in the State for State officers and member of the Thirty-second Congress. The campaign was a hot one. During the stump-speech season, and just prior to the election in August, a meeting was held at Albia, at which A. C. Dodge, Mr. Baker, et al., addressed the Democracy. A't this meeting, cheers were proposed for Mr. Barber, on the grounds that he had defeated the election of Miller. It may be here incidentally remarked that the August election resulted in the seating of Bernhart Henn, of Fairfield, in the Thirty-second Congress from this district, his term beginning in 1851. There still remained one session of the Thirty-first Congress, and after the August election referred to, the Miller-Thompson fight was renewed. During the controversy, Mr. Miller, or one of his friends, desired certain papers of Judge Mason, who was a strong counsel on the Democratic side. By mistake, the missing poll-books were handed to the Whig, who immediately announced the fact with an appropriate demonstration. This startling denouement completely upset the Democratic case, and a new election was ordered to\" fill vacancy \" in the First District. The election took place September 24, 1850, and resulted in the choice of Mr. Miller, who filled the seat in Congress one session. The question reverts to the cause of the Mormon change of front in 1848. All manner of rumors were afloat at the time, some of them even charging that the Democrats had offered but $1,000, while the Whigs had paid $1,200 for the vote. On the authority of one who admits that he was a party to the barter, we state as fact that the only gift presented to Elder Hyde by the Whigs was a printing office and some ten reams of printing-paper and a keg of ink. Hyde wanted an office, and the Whigs were willing to give him one. The materials for the office were shipped to him by the Whigs prior to the casting of the vote. Hyde had a grudge against the Democrats, which he desired to pay, and there fore refused to listen to overtures of a financial character from them. It was a case of diamond cut diamond, in which the Whigs proved the hardest. As to the missing books : it is a matter of evidence that Israel Kister placed them in Mr. Hall's saddle-bags, during the heated discussion, probably with no real intention to steal them at the time, but supposing that they would be dis covered before Hall left. They were not detected, and the lawyer rode away with them. It was then too late to acknowledge the error, and so the case stood until accident brought them to light. The Whig papers made furious onslaught against the Democrats over the affair, and there is but little doubt that it caused a decidedly good political war cry during those days. Dr. Flint was openly charged with having burned the books, and Barber was figuratively drawn and quartered continuously. The vigorous attacks upon Barber finally undermined his health and he died, a victim of mistaken sense of duty. Dr. Flint's career in the county of Wapello was one of considerable importance, until he was guilty of eloping, it is alleged, with a lady of his acquaintance, although he was an old man at the time. It is believed that he died, some years since, in Canada."], [456, "464 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. THE KNEELAND MOVEMENT. In January, 1834, Abner Kneeland, a former Orthodox minister, who had become an unbeliever, established himself at the head of a society in Boston called the \" Free Inquirers.\" The organ of this society was called the Inves tigator. Of course, this departure from the good old ways aroused popular resentment, and Kneeland was indicted December 20, 1833, on the grounds of publishing: 1. A scurrilous extract from Voltaire ridiculing the miraculous generation of Jesus. 2. An article declaring the practice of addressing prayers to God to be absurd. 3. A letter to the editor of the Tempest, in which he says : \" Universalists believe in a god (sic) which I do not ; but believe that their god (sic), with all his moral attributes (aside from nature itself), is nothing more than a chimera of their own imagination.\" On this indictment Kneeland was tried, found guilty and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. From this he appealed, but he was finally sentenced for two months A petition for his release was drawn up and signed by William Ellery Channing and 167 others ; but this was rejected. In 1837-38, a scheme was set on foot by the Investigator to found a colony at Salubria, about two miles south of Farmington, in this county. A levy of $10 was made upon each member of the society, to further this scheme, and among the first commissioners sent out were Abner r^neeland, E. Cutler, S. Smith, James W. Rice and Mr. Tower. But disagreements arose in the soci ety, and the scheme fell through, the colony in the mean time going to ruin. During its existence, however, it had some political influence, but now it has few survivors. The town of Salubria was a regular lithographed town, and was laid out by Mr. Kneeland, in Boston, and was mostly owned there. Its site is now only the common open country. Mr. Kneeland died August 27, 1844, aged seventy years, and is buried on his own soil, with his wife beside him. She was the mother of James W. Rice, one of the same band who came out originally from Boston. Mr. Kneeland was a man of more than usual ability, a radical and individual thinker, and one whose strong opinions amounted to positive convictions. At that period, there was less latitude in religious matters than at the present day, and a liber alist, by an open avowal of his lack of belief, placed a wider chasm between himself and the people at large than it would be possible to do in modern times. But Mr. Kneeland's sincerity, which is conceded, has gone far toward softening the severity of judgment which at one time, set in heavily against him, and what was sterling in his character is respected in his memory. THE VAN BUREN COUNTY PRESS. The first paper ever published in Van Buren County was at Keosauqua. It was called the Iowa Democrat and Des Moines River Intelligencer. In July, 1843, James Shepherd started from Springfield, 111., for the West, and on his way to Iowa was met by Cyrus Walker, who recommended Keosau qua as a good point to start a newspaper. Mr. Shepherd arriving at this place, a meeting was called, and the prospectus left with William Steele, a merchant, old citizen and Democrat of Keosauqua, to procure subscribers. It was the intention of Mr. Shepherd to have the paper advocate the Democratic principles of the day, and run it under the name of the Democratic Union."], [457, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 465 On his return to Springfield, he sent the material and printing press West by means of an ox-team and wagon, in care of his son, Jesse M. Shepherd, and J. L. T. Mitchell, a young man who was to receive one-half the profits of the concern to compensate for his labor. Mr. Shepherd instructed his son not to allow any person the control or dictation whatever over the policy of the paper. This, Mr. Steele did not like, and threw the prospectus into the fire. Mitchell being a Whig and young Shepherd a Democrat, they, upon the action of Steele, agreed to balance their political opinions and run the paper as a neutral sheet. A copy of the paper was sent to Springfield, and this was the first notice that Mr. Shepherd had received of the neutral policy. In the spring of 1844, he came out again, and immediately made arrange ments to purchase Mitchell's share, for which he (Shepherd) was to pay $25, and Mitchell to step out at the end of one year. This sum was given, and a horse in the bargain. There was a valedictory written by Mitchell and published in the last num ber of the paper of which he was partner that is worth preserving. It ran as follows: \"We (Shepherd, Jr., & Mitchell) both knew, by observation, that there was a certain set who would take the lead in acting for the people, and, when opportunity offered, cut from the loaf the largest slice for themselves. To these we gave our decided opposition, no matter what their faith or belief. Herein, then, consists our neutrality \u2014 determined opposition to demagogues ; a set that may be found in every community and in every party, and who deserve the contempt of every honorable and high-minded man.\" Upon Mitchell's withdrawal from the Intelligencer, he established a Whig paper, known as the Border Pioneer. It was run but a short time. At the expiration of one year, party spirit began to manifest itself among the people, and party lines were drawn at the approaching Presidential canvass between Henry Clay and James Polk. Besides this, what was denominated the American system bank tariff and other measures were put into issue before the people, and they began to choose sides. The Intelligencer was then changed to a political paper, advocating Democratic principles. James and Jesse M. Shepherd assumed the editorship. They continued it until 1850, when they sold to Ezra M. Jones. James Shepherd says upon this subject: \" During the next ten years, the office of the Democrat changed owners several times, the proprietors being the father of S. M. Mills, Seth Millington, Daniel Morris (who changed it to a Whig paper), J. M. Estes (who changed it back to the Democratic side) ; then Oliver J. Taylor run it into the Des Moines News, and in 1860, James and Jesse M. Shepherd purchased it and continued the publication under the name of the Des Moines News, on the same press and fixtures. It was Democratic in politics up to 1865, when they sold to G. S. Bailey, and he moved the press and fixtures to Albia, Monroe Co., Iowa, and published a paper there. In 1843, when the publication of the Democrat was commenced, it was the sixth in the Territory of Iowa. I recollect very well the notice given of its advent by J. Russell, who published a paper at Bloom ington (now Muscatine), Iowa. It was as follows : ' Two more candidates for the Poorhouse.' \" In 1845-46, the Des Momes Valley Whig was published at Keosauqua, by Howell & Cowles. No files exist from which to gain any correct information concerning this paper, and from the fact that it had passed out of mind, until revived through the research of the writer, it is safe to say that it did not long survive the shocks of adversity."], [458, "466 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Beginning with the year 1850, the newspapers of the county have appeared as follows: Keosauqua Jeff'ersonian April 29, 1850, by Arlando E. Jones, to May 26 1851. Western American, by L. D. and H. Morris, July 5, 1851, to July 3, 1852.

Absolute acquiescence in the decision of the majority.\" Seth Millington, editor, and Rufus Summerlin, publisher, came into posses- sion of the Union, January 29, 1853. Their first issue was No. 27 of Vol. I. Democratic Union, Vol. Ill, No. 1, R. Summerlin, editor and proprietor, was the next step. This continued until August 5, 1854. November 25, 1854, James Shepherd became editor of the Union and Sum- merlin, publisher. This until Vol. Ill, No. 17. The Democratic Mirror was named by John M. Estes, editor and proprietor, Jesse M. Shepherd, publisher, December 6, 1855. The paper was purchased from Millington. The motto was \" See Ahead.\" Oliver 0. Taylor, editor and proprietor of the .Des Moines News, published the next paper in this line under the motto, \" Constitutional Liberty,\" the change in names being made with No. 18 of Vol. I, on May 7, 1858. His salutatory was \" The harmonious blending of freedom and restraint, upon which the whole fabric of our Republic rests, and upon which it must continue to flourish, or perish.\" He continued it until March 31, 1860, when James Shep- herd became editor and Jesse M. Shepherd publisher. The first issue was Saturday, April 7, 1860. The Shady Side was the title of another paper published at Keosauqua. It was Republican in politics. Vol. I, No. 1, was published Friday morning, October 27, 1871, by Joel Mayne, editor and proprietor. With No. 16 of Vol. I, Mayne withdrew and D..H. Burton-became possessed of it. He issued No. 17 on Friday morning, March 8, 1872, and continued until No. 27, the last number being published July 26, 1872. The Keosauqua Republican was established September 12, 1854, by W. C. Worden and by him sold to L. D. Morris in 1855, the latter transferring to John S. Stidger in 1856. Stidger sold to L. D. Morris in 1858, and Morris sold to Joel Mayne in 1859. In 1868, he sold to George E. Henry, who, on February 12, 1877, sold one-half interest to W. H. Bleakmore, and, on August 30, 1877, the other half to J. M. Strong. Mr. Strong transferred his interest December 27, 1877, to Judge Joshua S. Sloan. ' The firm is now known as Sloan & Bleakmore. The Democrat was established at Bonaparte, January 19, 1870, by George F. Smith and R. I. Holcomb. After three months, Holcomb retired. Smith continued the publication until December 1, 1876, when he removed the paper to Keosauqua, where it is still published. Vernon cradled one of the first papers in the county. It was known as the Democratic Mirror, John M. Estes, being the editor and proprietor, and J. S. Shepherd, publisher. The motto of the paper was \" Submission to the will of majorities when constitutionally expressed.\" The first number was published Friday, December 7, 1855. The paper was continued until No. 42 of Vol. I. Then it was removed to Keosauqua. On October 17, 1856, No. 43 was issued. The paper was run until December 18, 1857, Vol. II, No. 50, and took the name"], [459, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 467 of the Valley Weekly News, and the motto, \" Devoted to general intelligence, the best interest of Southern Iowa, the Des Moines Valley, and of Van Buren County.\" John M. Estes continued as editor and proprietor. The first issue under the new name was January 1, 1858. The publication continued until April 30, 1858. The Bonaparte Signal was the first newspaper published at Bonaparte. A. C. Bailey was editor and proprietor. The date of the beginning was January 31, 1866. Wednesday was the publication day, but it was subsequently changed to Thursday. The paper was Democratic in politics. The motto was \" The affections of the people the only solid cement of union.\" The last number was issued Thursday, July 30, 1868, No. 27 of Vol. III. The Des Moines Valley Reporter, Republican in politics, was established January 18, 1872, by H. C. Ashbough. The paper bade the word good-by with Vol. I, No. 27, July 18, 1872. On April 5, 1877, J. W. and John H. Sherman, started the Bonaparte Journal, a weekly publication, independent in politics. The firm is know.n as Sherman Brothers. They are the youngest editors in the county. The Birmingham Enterprise was established in October, 1869, by W. J. Moore. He continued in charge one and one-half years, and sold to J. A. T. Hull, who continued as proprietor eighteen months, and then transferred the paper to J. S. Ragsdale. This arrangement continued one year and a half, when W. R. Parker came into possession of it. He bad charge of it six months, when he sold one-half of his interest to C. L. Sheward. The firm is now known as Sheward & Parker. The politics of the paper is \"Republican. The history of the press of Farmington, dates back only to the month of February, 1874, when M. L. Mooers started the Gazette. The paper was pub lished under that management until February 18, 1876, Vol. Ill, No. I, Mr. Mooers then being succeeded by A. Ditson, who published No. 2 of Vol. Ill, on February 25, 1876. J. M. Elliott came in possession of the Gazette soon after that, but the exact date is not known. He published the paper until the sum mer of 1878, when it was discontinued. George W. Baer established the Record, in 1878, the first number being published November 8. Its tone is neutral. The Milton Headlight was established in October, 1876, by Allen Ditson. He run it three months and sold it to Marsan & Baxter. They continued until October, 1877, when Marsan became sole owner. He run it until March, 1878, and then suspended. The Milton Herald was started in April, 1878, and is now run by McNeill & Baxter. KEOSAUQUA. Some Frenchmen, in an early day, inhabited the bend of the river Des Moines, in the pocket of which lies the village of Keosauqua. Around the bend dwelt a number of monks. The Indians, discovering these places of habitation, named the section where now lies the city, Keosauqua, the meaning of which is in Indian parlance, \" The river of monks.\" Keosauqua was laid off in April, 1839, by John Carnes, James Hall, James and Edwin Manning, John J. Fairman and Robert Taylor, these composing the \" Van Buren Company.\" \u25a0 Two triangular pieces of ground, or, more properly, fractions, first composed the town ; the south fraction or triangle being known as Van Buren and the"], [460, "468 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. north triangle as Des Moines. Later, a diamond-shaped piece of land was entered (one-fourth section lying obliquely been the triangles) and together with the Van Buren triangle assumed the name Keosauqua. Des Moines refused to come under the yoke or in any way affiliate with its neighbor. Both began contending for the county seat. In time, the settlers assembled (it was one Sunday night) and talked over a name under which both the triangles and diamond might be known. John Carnes suggested Pert Oro (a Spanish name, meaning \" Port \" or \" Land of Gold \"). There was some objection to this, as being a too high-sounding title for the place. Finally, Judge Irvin asked how they would like to have their three towns known under the name of Keosauqua. All agreed to it, and the matter was settled then and there. Down to the year 1846, the town had been growing steadily, and the country around, having become thickly settled, afforded the advantages of a large trade. This will be shown by the accompanying directory of Keosauqua, giving the places of business, etc., that the place then counted as its own : Dry Goods, Groceries, Hardware, etc. \u2014 Manning & Wasky, B.

Keosauqua was incorporated as a city under a general act of the Legislature, February 17, 1842. This act not being sufficient to cover the ground, a special act was passed in 1846. It was as follows: An Act to amend an act entitled \" An act to incorporate the city of Keosauqua.\" Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, That in case it shall become necessary to sell real estate in said city, for the payment, of taxes, the same shall be sold in the manner, and under such regulations, as the Mayor and Aldermen may have ordained ; and at the time and place when and where the Mayor and Aldermen may order and direct; Provided, four weeks' notice shall be given of such sale by advertisement in any newspaper published in said city, and by posiing on the Court House door of said city a written notice of such sale, for tie space of four weeks. Sec. 2. Such real estate shall be sold to the bidder who will pay the taxes, costs and expenses of such sale, for the lowest quantity of such real estate, to be taken off of such part of such real estate as the Mayor and Aldermen may direct. Sec. 3. Such real estate may be redeemed from such sale at any time within two years from the time of such sale, by the owner paying lo the purchaser, or Recorder of said city, for ihe use of such purchaser, the amount for which such real estate shall have been sold, and costs, with fifiy per centum per annum until paid. Sec. 4. The Mayor and Aldermen shall, at the expiration of two years from such sale, exe cute, in their corporate capacily, a deed for any real estate so sold and not redeemed to the pur chaeer or his assigns ; which deed shall be sufficient to convey the estate in fee to such pur chaser, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the regularity of the proceedings ; and no person shall ever question the title under such deed, either in a court of law or equity until such person shall have paid to or tendered to the purchaser the amount for which such real estate may have been sold, and fifty per centum per annum and the costs of sale. Approved January 19, 1846. The first meeting was held January 7, 1843, with James Hall, Mayor ; William Kemp, Recorder ; James B. Howell, Deputy Recorder. Nothing was done, however, until the meeting of May 13, 1844, for which the people had elected a City Council composed of Elisha Cutler, Jr., Mayor ; Edward R. Tyler, Recorder ; and James J. Kinersly, Henry M. Shelby. Richard Humpheries, Benson Henkle and Stephen Livingston, Aldermen. With this meeting the work of the city fathers commenced. The present city government is cared for by William Moore, Mayor ; Solon Nourse, James Shepherd, William Ford, Edwin Walker, W. H. Monroe and Samuel Fasnacht, Aldermen. The first marriage solemnized at Keosauqua was between Lewis Le Plont and Nancy Hill, on January 27, 1839, the ceremony having been performed by William Stanley, Justice of the Peace. The first claimant or squatter on the site of the present town was John Sil vers, who built, in the winter of 1835 and 1836, a small claim-pen of round logs, on the bank of the river, near where the Keosauqua Hotel now stands. This pen was perhaps eight or ten feet square. At that time,, or soon after, E. Purdom, Sr., had taken the claim immediately above town. Mrs. Sigler is believed to be the first white woman who ever made her home no the site now occupied by Keosauqua. In the fall of 1836, Silvers was bought out by Mesonhack Sigler for $300, who came here at that time with his father-in-law and brother-in-law, Eph. and William D. McBride. The elder McBride and Sigler returned to Indiana the same fall."], [462, "470 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. The first house (after the Silvers' claim-pen) was built in 1837 by the Van Buren Company. In this Messrs. Carnes & Fairman kept the first store. About this time, Fairman was appointed the first Postmaster of the place \u2014 the name of the office being Port Oro. In the year 1839, the first brick house was erected, by Edward R. Tylee. The same year, Elias Elder erected a part of what is now known as Alexander's brick or barracks. T. Lane opened the first tailor-shop, in the upper room of the building now occupied by Burton & Minich. During the next year, he formed a partnership with J. J. Kinersly. The first physician was Cyrus H. Ober, followed soon after by the late H. H. Barker. The first attorney was Isaac N. Lewis, now of Missouri, who soon after had a competitor (as he often facetiously expressed it), in Samuel W. Summers, now of Ottumwa. A. Myon and George W. Games located here in 1839, and started the first tan-yard, at the point below town. It was later on owned by the junior part ner of the firm, who successfully run it until within a few years past, when it was closed. The first tavern was kept by Elisha Puett, in a one-story log house, on or near the ground now occupied by the tin-shop of Mr. Grayum. He is said to have been a rough specimen of border life, and to have kept a house character istic of the man. He also, it is believed, kept the first grocery in the place. The first blacksmith was David Smith. He put up a frame shop. The first political convention of the county was held by the Democratic party, in the spring of 1840, in the District Court room. Of the first alleged \"duel,\" Judge George G. Wright speaks as follows : \"About this time (1836 or 1837), two of our citizens appealed to the code of honor forHhe settlement of their grievances. The parties were Aaron W. Harlan and one Bushnell. Their seconds were Russo King and M. Sigler \u2014 the place of meeting near where the Odd Fellows' Hall now stands. They had pistols without the coffee, and I am happy to state, that their friends reconciled the belligerents without the shooting. In the settlement, blows ensued, how ever. Harlan came off victor, and thus ended the first, and it is hoped the last, appeal to the bloody code in our law-abiding and peaceable community.\" Wilson Stanley and Sewall Kenney were the first Justices in the place. They were appointed by the Governor. Alfred Vertrees is believed to have been the first Constable. The first white child born in the place was a daughter to William Billups. William Billups was the first ferryman. The District Court was first held in this place in April, 1839 \u2014 the Hon. Charles Mason (afterward Commissioner of Patents) presiding. Mr. Duncan, before named, was Foreman of the grand jury, and the first trial by jury was that of the United States vs. Blankenship and Helms, for riot. Judge Wright, in an address speaks of Van Buren Company, and in one place, of a member, he says : \"John Carnes might be called appropriately the talking, bragging member of the firm. It was his peculiar province to dwell on the advantages of the place and its high destiny in the future. He originated the flaming handbills, and magnified the hydraulic privileges connected with our location at the Des Moines Rapids. And one person assures me that to these handbills, and Carnes' exaggerated statements as to the amount of water-fall and character of"], [463, ""], [464, ""], [465, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 473 the Rapids at this point, may be traced the idea in the minds of the Missourians that these Rapids were those meant in their State Constitution. In 1850, a private bank grew out of the savings of a number of citizens, among them J. H. Bonney, G. G. Wright, J. J. Kinersly, Joel Walker and George W. Games ; each of whom deposited $1 originally, and afterward twenty-five cents per week, with the condition that it was not to be drawn excepting for loans and purchases of notes. At the length of four or five years the amount deposited had grown to $5,000, and was divided among the depositors. EARLY AND LATE EDUCATORS. The pioneers of Van Buren County commenced their work by preparing themselves and their successors for the work before them, by the institution of a good system of popular education. But, as their means were limited, their first seminaries were like their dwellings \u2014 of logs ; the seats were benches made by splitting small logs, mostly of basswood, with very little polish, and that little done with an ax ; their desks were made by boring into the wall with a large auger, and inserting strong pins, inclining to the front, on which was fastened a plank, if any was to be had ; if not, what was called a \"puncheon,\" hewed on one side. The windows, instead of being perpendicular were hori zontal. And to these rude cabin-schools do Hon. G. W. McCrary, Hon. H. C. Caldwell and many other men of prominence owe their primary education. As the above mention applies to Van Buren County at large, it may, with propriety, be localized so as to apply to Keosauqua. Tom Wilkinson kept the first school at the (now) county seat in 1839. He taught in a log cabin standing in a lot now owned by Judge Sloan. Wilkinson left in 1842, and married a half-breed of the Cherokee nation. Caroline McBride taught at Keosauqua about 1840. Necessity brought into vogue the private subscription schools, and these continued from fifteen to twenty years. Mr. Lane taught one of these schools in 1851, in the Odd Fellows' rooms. The system of private schools was con tinued as late as 1866, during which time a small brick schoolhouse was put up. The independent school system was introduced about the year 1866. Keosauqua now has one of the finest graded school buildings in the county. There are five departments. The Principal of the school is Mr. John R. Lan des. The teachers are, Miss Mary E. Brown, First Primary ; Second Primary, Miss Ada Redd ; Intermediate, Clara Hartson ; Grammar School, Emma Lay ton. The report for November, 1878, showed the names of two hundred and seventy-nine scholars on the roll. The schoolhouse was erected in 1866, at a cost of $18,000. In 1839, a literary lyceum was established, the following being the act of incorporation : An Act to incorporate the Keosauqua Lyceum. Section 1.

Sec. 3. This act shall be subject to amendment by any suture Legislature. Approved, January 24, 1839, There was, during a period encircling the year 1851, an academy at this place. It ran a successful race with other schools of learning. In 1842, a lyceum was started under the management of Hon. George G. Wright, Hon. J. B. Howell, J. J. Kinersly, C. Baldwin, J. H. Bonney, Elisha Cutler, James Hall, Samuel Summers and others. It was carried on with spirit for about two years, when it was discontinued. THE CHURCHES. Father Purdom's was where the minister first found a home and a place to preach. The house was a double log cabin, with an entry between, and stoo d on the bank of the river, about three hundred yards above the town. Preach ing was heard but seldom, and as late as 1840 the Methodist minister preached once a month. Even then, one of these rooms would scarcely be filled. Bryant, Hawk, Summers, Arrington, Shinn, of the Methodist ; Bell and the two Ran kins (the uncle and nephew), of the Presbyterian, and Post, of the Baptist Church, if not the first, were among those who first taught the way of life to those attend ing upon their ministry at this place. They preached at the house in the winter. and frequently in the grove in the summer. The congregations were not large, but uniformly attentive, manifesting an appreciation of the moral lessons incul cated. Father Purdom was a Kentucky Methodist. His house was always open, however, to the traveling ministry of all denominations. While he had strong prejudices and great quaintness of character, he was a warm friend and as warm an enemy. He had a very strong attachment for his church, his home and his family. In 1848, he departed this life, much respected and lamented \u2014 and sleeps in the grave-yard \u2014 a tract which he gave from his premises for the town burying-ground. He left a large family, all of whom left and settled in Western Missouri. The first church organization was by the Methodists, under the leadership of Leonard B. Statler, a son-in-law of Elijah Purdom, who was appointed Class- Leader."], [467, "475 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Mr. Hadden built the first church at Keosauqua, in 1840. It was used by all denominations. The Rev. Daniel Lane has furnished the following descriptive article of the history of the Congregational Church : The first Congregational ministers who made a settlement with the people of Van Buren County were myself and Rev. Harvey Adams, the latter settling at Farmington, and myself at Keosauqua. This occurred in November, 1843. We were from Andover Theological Seminary, graduates of the same year of our arrival. There were seven other Congregational ministers, young men, who came to the then Territory of Iowa, with us, and two more followed us the next year, making in all a company of eleven young men, all of whom were from the Seminary at Andover, Mass., and all belonging to the same theological class \u2014 all classmates. One of the two who joined us in 1844, Rev. Erastus Ripley took for his ministerial fields Bentonsport and its surroundings. At this early period. Van Buren County was considered one of the most important counties in the Territory, made so by both the number of its inhabitants and by the fact that it was the home of Abner Kneeland, and his infidel colony. Mr. Keeland often lectured in Farmington, Bona parte, Bentonsport and Keosauqua in the interest of his peculiar views, and, of course, in oppo sition to Christianity. He had many converts \u2014 so many that in 1841 or 1842, an attempt was made to carry the county, politically, by an infidel ticket. The effort, however, was a failure. In entering upon my ministerial work in Keosauqua, however, I very soon made up my mind that the fundamental truths of the Gospel, and their practical bearing and influence in soci ety, were what the people needed more than any discussion upon infidelity. This decision I saw no reason for reversing during my ten years of ministerial labor in the town. The Congregational Church was organized in a little more than one year after my arrival in Keosauqua. The membership consisted only of five persons \u2014 two males and three females. Two of the five lived four miles from town. Only Mrs. Lane, my wife, lived in town, and the other two at a distance of two miles out. There was no church edifice in the place finished and ded icated until December, 1847, at which time the brick church in which the Congregationalists now worship, was completed and occupied. The effort in building that church edifice, and the sources whence came the funds for the payment of the bills, were somewhat peculiar. Being satisfied that a church edifice had become an actual necessity, in order to secure efficiency to my labors as Pastor of the Congregational Church, I called a meeting of those interested in such an enterprise, and laid before them my views of the whole matter. All present felt the importance of having a house of worship, but whence the money to secure it ? This was the practical question. In those early days in the county, there was but little money in anybody's pocket. Estimates were made of ihe cost of 'the house in question. About $140 must be raised at once, in payment for the brick. To raise this in cash, and to do it immediately, was an obstacle which seemed to those present insurmountable. The deliberations were closed with the convic tion that the erection of a \"meeting-house\" must be deferred until another year. I went home from that small gathering of six or seven persons with feelings in close proximity to discouragement. I had already labored some three years in Keosauqua, and only about one-half of that time had our Church been favored with any place for regular preaching each Sabbath. To continue this was contrary to all my ideas of ministerial usefulness. My salary, at this time, was $400, the greater part paid in cash by the American Missionary Society, of New York. On reaching home, 1 unburdened my mind to my wife, and a long conversation ensued. I finally asked her if she thought we could possibly get along with family expenses if I should make myself responsible for the payment for the brick which would be required for the house in contemplation. To take $140 out of $400, when we had no other pecuniary resource whatever, seemed, at first, like opening the door to financial helplessness. After a long talk, we came to the conclusion that our friends in Keosauqua would not allow us to die of starvation in any event which might result from the diminished salary. And so, under the quieting thought, wife says : \" Yes, we will try to do without the $140, if, by so doing, we can have a house of worship of our own.\" This answer given, my plan was at once determined upon, and I was at rest. I slept, soundly that night, and the next morning, was ready for further action. There was a brickmason then living in Keosauqua, of the name of Jesse Winn. He had always promised me that when we were ready to build a church, if we would put one up of brick and give him the job, he would do a good thing for us. The first thing to be done was to see him. I found him finishing the cornice of a small brick building. Ascending the ladder to where he was standing, in the familiar language of Iowa's infancy, I said to him : \" Jesse, if I will furnish the brick from my own purse for a church edifice, will you lay them up free of /lllQ I'l ' f ' He looked at me to see if I was in earnest. That question settled, he laid his trowel upon the bricks straightened himself up with folded arms, and said: \"I don't know, Mr. Lane; that is a temptation. A moment intervened, and then he added: \" I owe Jesse Elder $50 on"], [468, "476 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. I an election bet. I lost the bet and gave him my note for $50. If you will go to him and get him to give me that note on condition that I do the brick work of the church, I will do it.\" I was at the bottom of the ladder. I had descended in quicker time than I went up ; and my next man was Jesse Elder, and I said to him : \" Jesse, if I will furnish the brick for a church of 30x40 feet, and 14-foot post, and Jesse Winn will lay them up on condition that you will sur render to him that election-bet note which you hold against him, will you do it ? \" He replied without a moment's reflection: \"Tell Jesse Winn if he will do that, there will be no trouble about his $50 note.\" The house of worship, in my enthusiasm for the moment, was built. That was one of the best mornings of my life. He who makes \"the wrath of man praise Him\" was now extolled by an election bet ! This was something that no theologian, however learned had thought of. But there was something else to be done. Another meeting was called of the six or seven who had met the previous night and decided adversely. Now, at their second deliberation, the whole face of the enterprise was so changed that all were encouraged lo rise up and build. A subscription \u2014 including the gift of a lot for the site of the church \u2014 was raised, of $600; the Pastor, however, subscribing only S100, instead of $140. Against his paying the latter sum, there was such an earnest protest from those present that, instead of carrying out his first deci sion, he diminished the sum by $40. Afterward, however, before the building was finished, he paid $20 more. But the brick, the brick work and the subscription, including the church lot, being secured, the next thing was provision for the foundation of the house. There was a stone-quarry near, and from its owner I gained permission to get all the necessary stone free of charge. Then, mount ing my horse, I rode to the two members of my Church livingfour miles from town. They were hus band and wife ; the husband was a stone-mason. Telling him my errand, he immediately agreed to do the foundation work for his share in the enterprise. But both the stone and the brick must be trans ferred to the church lot before either the stone or the brick-masons could enter upon their work. There were living then two friendly families, the one six and the other seven miles from town. Both had good double teams, with accompanying wagons. To think of those friends was equivalent to immediate action. Again I was on my horse, bound for their prairie homes. Find ing the men and telling my errand, they agreed at once to see the stone and brick in their proper place on the church lot; and all this free of charge. Triumphant moment that, under responses so favorable ! Again, in imagination, the house was built. Perhaps it was ministerial which prevented a victorious \"hurrah!\" with the usual swinging of the hat. Be this as it may, there was at that moment, as I hope, some gratitude to the Author of sanctuary worship for this preliminary success. And now, strange to say, it took us about one year and a half to complete the building, not withstanding our auspicious beginning. The times were hard, lumber was dear, carpenter work was costly, funds came in slowly, and many were the obstacles causing delay of the work. Finally it was done, except a few last things, the cost of which would be some $30 \u2014 a small amount; but how to raise it at first was not very apparent, for it seemed to me the members of the church had given the last cent they could spare. The building had now cost us about $1,000. At length, a happy thought, as it afterward proved, occurred to me, and I went into my study \u2014 which was originally a smoke-house, but now finished for a theological sanctum \u2014 caught up a slip of paper and wrote upon it the name of every man in town outside of our Church mem bership who, I thought, would be willing to give me $1 toward the $30 needed. I then sallied forth to try success in this new direction. It is enough here to say that, with only one exception, I secured the dollar of every man whose name I had written upon that paper. All was now ready for the final finish of the building, which was soon done, and the house, with thankful hearts, was then dedicated, free of debt and with no solicited aid from abroad, to the God of sanctuaries and sanctuary worship. The church in which the Methodist denomination now worship was built in 1851. Rev. Henry Clay Dean was the Pastor at that time. The membership is, perhaps, two hundred. Rev. S. S. Murphy is Pastor. The church was remodeled in 1874. The colored people have two churches here. The Baptists use the building on the hill formerly occupied as a schoolhouse, while the Methodists worship in the little brick church near the river-bank. THE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY. In conformity with an act of the Territorial Legislature of Iowa, approved December 19, 1838, a meeting of the citizens of Van Buren County was held in the town of Keosauqua on Saturday, September 11, 1841, for the purpose of organizing a county agricultural society."], [469, "477 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY'. Obed Stannard was elected President, George Wright, Secretary, and J. H. Bonney, Treasurer. There were seven Directors chosen. The first fair held was in the fall of 1842. Col. Stiles S. Carpenter delivered the address. It'was the first agricultural address in the county, and probably the first ever delivered in the State of Iowa. A. W. Harlan, James H. King, William Hadden, W. S. Wright and William Duncan took part in the first meeting. There were one or two fairs held, after which the interest seems to have lagged, until September 27, 1851, when a meeting was held \"for the purpose of forming an agricultural society.\" Dr. J. B. Elbert was appointed Chair man and L. D. Morris, Secretary. A committee of seven were appointed to draft Articles of Incorporation. Those seven were Capt. J. E. Miller, A. H. McCrary, I. W. McManaman, Seth Millington, H. C. Caldwell and L. D. Morris. A vote was then taken for officers and Directors of the Society. The result was : Dr. J. D. Elbert, President ; Robert Meeks and Capt. J. E. Miller, Vice Presidents ; H. C. Caldwell, Recording Secretary ; L. D. Morris, Corresponding Secretary ; Seth Millington, Treasurer ; I. W. McManaman, A. H. McCrary, James Burns, John M. Whitaker, C. H. Bonner, A. Phillips, Nathanal Myer, E. Mayne and Seth Fordyce, Directors. The first fair was held Tuesday, October 28, 1851. The Society has held successful meetings each fall since. There was a historical society formed at Keosauqua in 1838, which had a successful and protracted life. The society is now defunct. PIONEER ASSOCIATION. One of the institutions at Keosauqua (belonging equally to all sections of the county) is the Pioneer Association. The call for a meeting of the citizens was made in June, 1871. The call was signed by Edwin Manning, Charles Baldwin, J. J. Kinersly, Thomas Rankin, James Bell, Bertrand R. Jones, Joel Walker, Russo King, George W. Games and James Shepherd. The first meeting was held Saturday, July 22, 1871. On motion of Charles Baldwin, Dr. N. Shepherd was called to the chair, and Bertrand R. Jones was appointed Secretary. The Chairman stated the object of the meeting. The following resolutions were adopted : '\u2022'Resolved, That this meeting do now adjourn to meet again the 5th day of August, and that a committee of five be appointed by the Chair, whose duty it shall be to give notice of the adjourned meeting in the county papers, and to invite all the old settlers of Van Buren County to attend said adjourned meeting, for the purpose of organizing an Old Settlers' Association.\" The Chair appointed as such committee, Charles Baldwin, James Shepherd, Dr. R. N. Cresap, Capt. F. Hancock and Maj. J. C. McCrary. In accordance with the resolution of the previous meeting, the Association met August 5, 1871, Dr. N. Shepherd in the chair. It was resolved that all persons who had resided in Van Buren County thirty years be entitled to become members of the Association. The first permanent members were : Abner H. McCrary, President ; Capt. Frederick Hancock, Vice President ; B. R. Jones, Secretary, and Jonathan Thatcher, Treasurer."], [470, "478 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Successive meetings were held, and to-day the Association is in a prosper ous condition. The present officers are as follows : Capt. Frederick Hancock, President ; Charles Baldwin, Vice President ; Edwin Goddard, Secretary ; Harvey Duf field, Treasurer ; Jonathan Thatcher, Marshal. Board of Control \u2014 Cedar Township, William C. Morris; Union Township, George Parker; Lick Creek Township, Charles Porter ; Village Township, Jonathan Nelson ; Chequest Township, Ira Claflin ; Van Buren Township, Stephen Fellows ; Washington Township, Mrs. Marguerite Sanford; Harrisburg Township, Robert Sturdi vant; Farmington Township, Robert Gray ; Bonaparte Township, Isiah Meek ; Vernon Township, Aaron H. Thatcher; Henry Township, Sylvester S. Henry; Des Moines Township, Hyram Baird ; Jackson Township, John C. Holland. The members of the Association number about five hundred. KEOSAUQUA INCIDENTS. A bridge across the river at Keosauqua was commenced in 1850, but never completed. It fell down when partly erected, in 1851. The ferry was then used until the new bridge was built. The bridge enterprise cost the citizens about $6,000, for which they received nothing in return. The first, and probably only, flatboat from Keosauqua direct to New Orleans was built by Samuel Morton, two miles below town, in the spring of 1841. It was loaded with pork by Manning & Steeles. A. W. Harlan, was the com mander and pilot. It reached the port in May. William Duncan commenced erecting a mill in the fall of 1837, below town. Mr. Kinersly tells that, in 1838, there were but three or four women here, and, in 1842, the number of old bachelors had increased to thirty-five. Edwin Manning was the first to leave the ranks of single blessedness. Kinersly was the only man who had a stove in those days. Quail were worth $1 apiece; and, although an expensive luxury, the rush to get a meal of quail cooked over Kinersly's stove was great. In 1845 and 1846, there were but three families out of the seven hundred people who were not ill. Bilious and intermittent fevers raged, and there was a heavy mortality list in consequence. A story is told of Lorenzo Ellis. He went to Des Moines in an early day to purchase a grindstone. He bound it to his back and started home. He wandered around until lost, and did not find his way home for ten days. In \" Tyler's time,\" the Rev. Delazon Smith was sent to Ecuador as Com mercial Agent, at a salary of $8 per day and expenses. He was called home several times, but could never be induced to come until the Government stopped his salary. This circumstance earned him the nom de plume of \" Lost Smith,\" or \" Tyler's Lost Minister.\" As an interesting incident, it may be well to mention that Keosauqua has paid in hard cash $25,000 for railroad schemes, the consummation of which was never known. MILLING INTERESTS. It has been mentioned elsewhere that, in 1837, Dunken, Weatherly & King built a saw-mill. Prior to 1839, the people had been obliged to go thirty-five miles to get their milling done. In 1839, the company in question added a small run of buhrs to their mill and began grinding corn. In 1842 or 1843, a flour-mill was erected by William Hadden. Beesucker & McGuire. The mill"], [471, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 479 finally run into the hands of McGuire, and he sold it to J. J. Kinersly and Elisha Cutler in February, 1849. Cutler died in July of that year, and Kin ersly became sole proprietor. He improved it in 1850, and, in 1852, put up an additional building at a cost of $5,000, the improvement embracing a saw mill, carding machine, turning-lathes, and circular saws. In 1854, the State commenced making improvements along the river. A lock and part of a dam were built. In February, 1857, the ice-gorge knocked the mills from their foundations, and they floated down the stream. The State improvement was abandoned in 1858, and, in 1860, Mr. Kinersly began the erection of his pres ent mill, which was completed in February, 1862. Mr. Kinersly has now in process of building a new twelve-foot dam. The water-power at this point is highly valuable, there being a fall of twelve feet in the river, commencing above Pittsburg. There was a steam saw-mill put up in 1845 by Johnson & Brown. The former died, and, in 1854, the structure was torn down. There was a pottery established here in 1846. It was run five or six years and closed out. Dr. Strickland started one in 1871, which, after two or three years, shared the fate of its former sister-pottery. McNeal & St. John had a plow-factory here in 1865, and they operated it until 1870, when it was closed. THE BRIDGE. Keosauqua has a bridge. It was commenced in February, 1873, and com pleted by October 1, 1873, at a cost of $45,000. The bridge has 4 spans of 153 sect each, making the total length of the superstructure 612 feet. There are 3 piers and 2 abutments. The distance from low-water mark to the floor of the bridge is 32 feet. The arches are 17 feet high. The bridge is built to accommodate 2,000 pounds to the lineal foot, using one-fourth the entire capacity. THE LODGES. Keosauqua Lodge, No. 3, I. O. O. F., was organized July 22, 1845. It was the first Lodge in the county and third in the State. The organizers were W. H. Mauro, N. G. ; David Roroer, V. G. ; Richard Mansly, William Gar rett. Petitioners \u2014 Frank Bridgeman, J. Johnson, B. P. Marlow, J. J. Kin ersly, George Montague. The Degree of Rebekah was introduced into the Lodge in the summer of 1852. The present officers of the Lodge are Lee R. Merideth, N. G.; J. C. Mc- Crary, B. T. ; M. O. Ketchum, Sec. ; J. H. Duffield, F. S. ; Solon Nourse, Treas. There is a benevolent feature of the Lodge worth mentioning. During thirty years, there has been paid in $10,000, and the contributions for relief have been generous. In 1845, a literary organization was started, and the effort supplied the Lodge with a library. The movers in this direction were George A. Chitten den, Judge Wright, J. P. Howell, Judge Knapp, J. H. Bonney, Charles Bald win, H. M. Shelby and J. J. Kinersly. The Lodge now numbers eighty members, and has property valued at $2,500. There is a Grange in the county of Van Buren, with thirty branch granges. There is a membership of 1,511. The society was organized in 1872. The date of dispensation of the Keosauqua Lodge, No. 10, A.. F. k A. M., was 1845, and, in 1846, the charter was granted."], [472, "480 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. The charter officers were: James Shepherd, W. M.; Isaac Reed, S. W.; Frederick Hancock, J. W.; John Carnes, Tiler and Treasurer; Moses Big ford, Noble Barron, James H. Boon, Master Masons. This Lodge was second in the county until the charter of the Farmington Lodge, No. 9, was surrendered, which places Keosauqua Lodge first on the roll. The Lodge possesses the charred remains of Black Hawk's sword. The lodge-building was burned November 24, 1871, and the charter was destroyed. A new charter was granted the following year. The present officers of the Lodge are : Stephen D. Fellows, W. M.; James Shepherd, S. W.; Robert Dolburg, J. W.; H. G. Miller, Secretary; Joshua S. Sloan, Treasurer ; John Varner, S. D.; Abe Wilkin, J. D. ; J. J. Kinersly, Tiler. Knights Templar Lodge, Eli Chanau, No. 28, was chartered in October, 1875. It was constituted February 4, 1876. The grand officers were : 0. P. Waters, G. C; Robert F. Bower, T. G.; John C. Parish, D. G. C. The first appointed officers were: Robert L. Clark, E. C; George C. Gebhardt, Gen. The present officers are : I. D. Pergrin, C. G.; R. Lea, S. W.; Abe Wilkin, J. W.; 0. B. Brown, P.; L. L. Therme, Treasurer; C. A. Gleckler, Recorder. A dispensation was originally issued for Moore Chapter, No. 23, at Farm ington, July 18, 1857, but, before the charter was granted, the Order was moved to Keosauqua, and a charter granted September 8, 1859. The charter officers were: George C. Gebhardt, H. P.; James Shepherd, King; Henry King, S. The present officers are: Benjamin Johnston, H. P.; James S. Shepherd, King ; D. C. Beaman, S.

Just across the bridge from Keosauqua, lies the hamlet of Pleasant Hill, with perhaps one hundred dwellers. It was laid out March 20, 1850, by John Purdom. There is a hotel and blacksmith-shop there. Also, the Christian Church, erected in 1866, and one small schoolhouse. There was once a store in the town. FARMINGTON. Farmington was laid out in 1839 by Henry Bateman. At this village, the county seat was first located, and two sessions of court were held. At that time, the \" Jail \" for the holding of prisoners was a stump to which prisoners were chained. Finally, an 8x10 pine Jail was put up. The story goes that, once upon a time, a man was incarceeated here who worked a pecul iar escape. He lifted the Jail on his shoulders by getting under the rafters and carrying it to a trench or hollow, over which he set the building, and then crawled out by way of the hollow. The early settlers here were Jesse Wright, John Petra, T. J. Wright, Col. Davidson, Rhodes Westcoat, O. Tower, 0. Stoddard, Daniel Jewett, James Alfrey, Jonas Denny, Bill Jordan, John Maxwell, Crit. Forquraen, Able Garland and John Fretwell."], [473, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 481 James Burns was here in that early day, and kept the first hotel, and James F. Death had the first mill here, and in the county as well. Jacob Alfrey, a son of James and Maggie Alfrey, was the first child born at Farmington. A Mr. Williams, a stranger in the county, was the first one to die at Farm ington. At that time, there were no coffins in this part of the county, and the death of Mr. Williams compelled the pioneers to make a rude coffin of linn puncheons. William Brattin and Miss Croxwell were the first couple married at Farm ington. Dr. Miles was thejirst physician. The first Justice ot the Peace was Henry Bateman. Dr. R. D. Barton was the first Postmaster, and for a time kept the office in his hat. CITY GOVERNMENT. The population of Farmington is about one thousand inhabitants. It is an incorporated city, having become so during the General Assembly of the Iowa Legislature in 1846\u201447. The first election of officers was held on the second Saturday of March, 1847. Henry Benson was elected Mayor. The Alder men were Festus Dunning, H. D. Swasey, Jehu Stewart and James Craig. The present city government consists of A. J. Shaw, Mayor ; John Whit ten, Register ; William Goodin, Treasurer ; George Miller, Marshal, and J. T. Cross, William Bank, Busiel Boyer and James Carr, Aldermen. Henry Ben son and A. J.

The place supports three lawyers, five physicians and two Justices of the Peace. THE MANUFACTURES. The noticable branch of manufacturing done here is the Farmington Wagon and Carriage Works, owned by Lewis Burg. Mr. Burg learned his trade and then worked seven years, during which time he saved $1,400. With that he erected a shop 20x40 and started with three hands. That was in 1865, and in the following fall, he built a new shop, and the year after that, he added to it and employed seven hands. His business has grown until his works cover one quarter of a block. He employs sixteen to eighteen hands, and makes 250 wagons and 40 buggies each year. The Burlington k Southwestern Railroad Company have a portion of their shops here, and employ from ten to twelve hands. In the spring of 1844, James F. Death put up the first steam flour-mill in the place. That was soon closed and, in the year of 1852, Week & Stoddard built a new mill. This was run until 1866, when the ice-gorge carried it down the stream. Joseph Dickey then built one, and operated it until 1875, when S. M. Hurd k Son bought it and built the Diamond Mill. They run it until April, 1878, when C. A. Gleckler purchased it. The capacity of this mill is 200 bushels in twelve hours.

The first minister who preached at Farmington was Richard Jones. He had a house on the island, where he held forth for a considerable time. He belonged to the Christian order. There are now five denominations at Farmington, the first formed being the Congregational. An extract from the record of the Church, says : \" On Sunday, June 14, A. D. 1840, several individuals convened at the house of M. A. Britton, Esq., who were desirous of forming themselves into a church in Farmington. Present, Rev. Asa Turner, of Denmark, and the Rev. Clark, of Fort Madison. Rev. W. F. Barnes was chosen clerk, pro tem. Whereupon the following persons gave in their names as favorable to the object of the present meeting, viz.: John Penwell, and Ellen, his wife, from the Pres byterian Church in Rushville, Ohio ; W. F. Barns, from the Congregational Church at Warlane, 111., and Maria M., his wife, from the Presbyterian Church"], [475, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 483 at Maysville, Ky. ; A. J.

Colton, and Mary, his wife, from the Congre gational Church at Quincy, 111. ; Eli Millard, and Ph\u0153be, his wife, from the Congregational Church at Manchester, Conn., and Marcia Colton.\" The denomination built their church in 1848. Rev. Harvey Adams served as their Pastor from 1843 to November 11, 1866. The society have 181 mem bers. They are without a minister now. The Baptist society of Farmington was organized Saturday, August 28, 184], at 2 o'clock P. M., by Elder Daniel Jewett. The society struggled along, meeting at the houses of the Church members until 1851 and 1852, when they erected a church, the Pastor of which was Rev. W. H. Turton. The present Pastor is Rev. William Young, assisted by Rev. Mr. Turton. The German Methodist society of this place was organized in 1853, by Rev. H. Ellback, and a church was erected, and dedicated the last Sunday in May, 1855. The Rev. William Cuppen is present Pastor. In 1862, the German Lutherans, under the leadership of Rev. Oswald Mer bitz, organized a society and built a church. The society is still in a prosperous condition. The Catholic Church of Farmington was built in 1863-64. Rev. Father Hayes was first Pastor, and has been succeeded by three or four clergymen, until Father O'Brien was assigned to the charge. He continues at Farmington at present. In 1875, the society of the Latter Day-Saints was formed by Rev. James McKiernan and has continued since that time. The Methodist society of Farmington was formed as early as 1840. In 1845, a church was erected, which has served the worshipers since. THE SCHOOL. Prior to the building of the public schoolhouse, in 1870, the city of Farm ington educated her children in rented houses and other places of convenience. There is no record of who the first teacher was, or where the school was kept. In 1866. the district became independent. The schoolhouse cost $10,000 and is used as a graded institution. The first teacher in the house was L. M. Moores. Among the early legislative records is found the following bill, incorporating the first high school or academy ever instituted in the county. The appearance of this document will doubtless serve to refresh the memories of some of the early settlers of Farmington, and may serve to stimulate research for school records among the members of the Pioneer Association. An act to incorporate the Farmington Academy and High School. Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Iowa' That there shall be established in the town of Farmington, in Van Buren County, an institution of learning to be known and designated as the \" Farmington Academy and High School,\" and by that name may sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with, use a common seal, purchase. receive by gift or devise, hold, control, enjoy, sell and convey, any property, real, personal or mixed, for the use and benefit of said institution.

INCIDENTAL AND ACCIDENTAL. There was an ice-freshet at this point in 1832, when the water stood four feet over the territory now occupied by the village of Farmington. The overflow extended as far north as Bonaparte. The high water of 1851 did not seriously affect this village. In the winter of 1866,. Farmington was bothered with an ice-gorge, which commenced at Athens and extended up the river five miles. The flow of the tide did considerable damage. Meek k Stoddard's flour-mill was washed away, and also a number of small houses between Front street and the river. About ten years ago, occurred the only murder that ever happened at Farmington. A prisoner named Cockley shot and killed Constable Feuste maker, while the latter was in the performance of his duty transferring the prisoner to the Jail for a thieving offense. Cockley made his escape and was never found. In the autumn of 1874, occurred the only fire of note ever happening at Farmington. The flames licked up the stores of L. L. Therme k Son, drugs ; Charles Doeling, cigar manufacturer ; Charles Kessler, dry goods ; George Perry, hardware ; Will Gooden, groceries. The Masonic lodge-room, in the third story of Therme's building, was also destroyed. The loss caused was $20,000, on which there was a partial insurance. The fire is supposed to have originated from a lamp explosion. BONAPARTE. The village of Bonaparte was commenced in the year 1837, by Messrs. Meek k Sons and Dr. R. N. Cresap, whose initiatory step embraced the build ing of a dam across the Des Moines River. The early settlers, whose presence was marked by the year in question, y/ete P. R. Rice, Joseph Rabb, Erwin Wilson, David Sewell, Lewis Christian and William Welch. A few cabins were built about the wild country, and from the rude hut-town the place has grown until the din of machinery and clang of the mills is heard by 1,200 people, who constitute the present population of the place. This population support four dry goods stores, two drug stores, four grocery stores, one harness-shop, one jewelry house, two boot and shoe stores, one cloth ing house, one general store, three millinery establishments, two furniture stores, three tailor-shops, two commission houses, two agricultural marts, two butcher shops, two hotels, and a photograph establishment ; while the following branches of manufacturing also thrive : a woolen-mill, wagon-factory, brick-yard, pottery, blacksmith-shop, flouring-mill, saw-mill and glove-factory. There is one printing office in the place ; also, three churches, one schoolhouse, Masonic and Odd Fellows' Halls and a livery firm. There are four physicians and two Justices of the Peace in the place."], [477, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 485 The following legislative enactment will be read with interest by the people who first settled near Bonaparte : An Act to authorize William Meek Jr Sons to erect a dam across the Des Homes River. Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, That William Meek & Sons be, and they are hereby authorized to construct a dam across the Des Moines River, in Van Buren County, in said Territory, between Sections 8 and 17, in Township 68 North, Range 8 west of the fifth principal meridian, which said dam shall not exceed three feet in height above common low-water mark, and shall contain a convenient lock, not, less than one hundred and thirty feet in length and thirty-five feet in width, for the passage of steam, keel and flat boats, rafts and other water-craft, provided said water-craft will bear two tons burthen.

Cresap kept the first hotel. The first blacksmith was R. B. Willoughby, and Hamilton Kearns was the first wagon maker. Jackson Myers is said to have started the first flouring-mill, although William Meek & Sons put up one in 1844, which served until the fall of 1878, when Robert Meek & Brothers erected a new one, at a cost of $15,000. The struct ure is of brick, size 40x50 and four stories in height. The mill has six runs of buhrs. Meek & Brothers also erected a saw-mill in 1860, which has run since that time. The manufacturing interests of this place are nearly all centered in the woolen-mill, and manufacturing has received a healthy start, and the life instilled into this branch of industry at the beginning, instead of growing less, has been fanned into a noticeable flame, which spreads with the tread of time. One of the most extensive and successful woolen-factories of the State is situated at Bonaparte. It was built in the summer of 1853, by William Meek & Sons, who run it at a paying rate until 1863, when it was burned down, caus ing the firm a loss of $20,000. Robert F. Meek k Brothers immediately commenced rebuilding, and, at a cost of $50,000, made of brick a structure 50x85, and four stories high. The machinery is propelled by water-power. The firm employ seventy-five hands. The capacity of the mill isa matter worthy of mention. There are 1.640 spindles in use, six sets of carding machines and two shearing machines. The"], [478, "486 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. mill hands turn out 22,000 yards of cloth every four weeks and from 1,600 to 1,800 pounds of stocking-yarn. A pottery was started in 1866 by Parker & Handback. This firm con tinued in business five years, when Mr. Wilson succeeded Mr. Parker and became known as the junior partner. The firm are now known as Handback k Wilson. In November, 1876, the pottery building was burned, at a loss of $1,200. It was rebuilt at once, the outlay being $1,300. The firm now employ ten hands and make 75,000 gallons of pottery per year. A new feature has been added recently. It is a tile-factory, with a capacity for turning out 6,000 feet of tile per day. The machinery throughout is run by steam-power. THE BONAPARTE BRIDGE. There are two bridges in the county of Van Buren over the Des Moines River, for the accommodation of the general public \u2014 that is, foot-travelers and teams. The larger of the two is at Bonaparte, it having 5 piers, 6 spans of 150 feet each, 23-foot truss and an 18-foot roadway. This structure was commenced November 25, 1877. On Tuesday, January 29, 1878, the bridge was tested and formally accepted. Word was sent to the farmers in the neighborhood that teams and men would be required to fix the approaches and test the strength of the bridge. The test consisted of twenty-two heavily-loaded wagons, averaging fifty hundred weight, besides horses, mules and men. The aggregate burden on each span was recorded at seventy-five tons, and in but one place did the settle exceed one-eight of an inch. The superstructure is 900 feet long. Each span weighs 60 tons. The bridge stands 35 feet above low-water mark and from the bed of the river to the top of the truss the distance is 60 feet. The capacity of the bridge is 11,440 pounds per lineal foot. The approaches of the bridge are protected by a wing-wall and two abutments. The piers are 10 feet by 30 at their base. The cost of the superstructure was $35,000. The following gentlemen composed the executive committee at the date of acceptance: Isaiah Meek, Thomas Christy, Uriel Neal, A. Whitlock, T. W. Boyer and Dennis Haney. THE CHURCHES. The date of church organizations at Bonaparte does not run back far. The earliest move made in the direction of establishing churches was in 1853, when the Baptists, under the pastorate of Rev. William Sutton, began building a church, which was finished in the year 1857. Prior to that, however \u2014 1851 \u2014 the same society had been organized at Mt. Zion, where they worshiped until 1853, when they removed to Bonaparte. The second Pastor was Rev. William Eggleston ; the third, Rev. Mr. Burkholder ; the fourth. Rev. Mr. Inskeep ; the fifth was Rev. William Johnson ; the sixth, Rev. Mr. Trevitt. and the seventh, Rev. W. C. Pratt. At present the society are without a Pastor. They have one hundred and twenty-five members and a house of worship that cost $2,800. The date at which the Methodist society of this place was organized is not known, neither are there any records of early work. For a time, however, the Methodists used the schoolhouse, where they worshiped until that building was burned down, when they rented the Baptist Church, which served them down to the year 1862, when they built a new church, at a cost of $700. The society numbers about fifty members. Who organized it is not known. Rev. Mr. Johnson preached for a while \u2014 the first \u2014 in the new church, but who led the"], [479, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 487 flock in the olden day memory does not reveal. The Rev. Charles W. Shepherd is the present Pastor. In 1869, the Presbyterian society was organized, and, in 1871, they built a $2,800 church, of which Rev. H. R. Lewis was the first Pastor. Next came Rev. H. K. Heighney, followed by Rev. James Welch, who is the present one. There are fifty members belonging to the Church. THE SCHOOLS. Bonaparte has quite a school history. The first district schoolhouse was put up in 1844. Thomas Chariton was the first teacher in the village. The house stood until 1859, when it was burned down. However, in the mean time, schools were kept in the buildings at present occupied by Mr. Carr as a shop, and in what is now Mr. King's house. After the old schoolhouse burned, the district rented schoolroom until the Directors purchased the academy in 1871. The academy in question was erected in 1865, 1866 and 1867, by the Bona parte Academy Association, at a cost of $20,000. The Association used it as an academy from 1867 to May 26, 1871, when they sold it as above stated for the sum of $12,000. The Association was an incorporated body. The following lines are extracted from the beginning of the articles of agreement or incorporation : \" We, Isaiah Meek, Thomas Christy, Joseph A. Keen, J. G. Vale, Benjamin Wagner, John T. Stewart, George W. Sturdevant and A. H. Leach, do hereby incorporate ourselves, and all other persons who may become members of the corporation hereby created, into a body corporate and politic, by the name and style of the 'Bonaparte Academy Association.'\" The purpose of this institution was \" the promotion of literature, science and art.\" The articles of agreement further provided that the capital stock must not run below $10,000. The first Principal of the Academy was E. P. Howe. One year prior to the purchase of the Academy, the Bonaparte district became independent. The October, 1878, report showed that the total enroll ment in all the departments of the school was 168, and the average daily attend ance about 126. The school is divided into four departments. Annie E. Packer is the present Principal. CITY GOVERNMENT. Bonaparte is not an incorporated town. The officers embrace two Jus tices of the Peace and a Constable. The first Justice was Samuel Reed, who lived two and a half miles from town ; but the first in the village proper was R. B. Willoughby. A. J. Myers was the first Constable. The present Justices are W. W. Entler and Joseph Perkins. Samuel Spurgeon is Con stable. The village Postmaster is J. P. Davis. When the place was introduced to a mail-route, Thomas Chariton had the honor of being the first Postmaster. R. Moffit was the first Postmaster at Lexington, just above town. The first physician in the village was Dr. R. N. Cresap. William Willoughby, son of R. B. Willoughby, was the first child born at Bonaparte. The first death was in the person of Mrs. Angeline, wife of Dr. Cresap. The first marriage that took place was April 8, 1841, when James A. Kearn and Elizabeth Williamson were joined in the holy bonds of wedlock."], [480, "488 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. SECRET ORDERS.

This town had a healthy start, and the little neighborhood of people who had come to settle there were loyal, too, and did not forget or turn their backs upon the good old-fashioned way of celebrating Independence Day. In the same year the town was laid out, the hearts of the stalwart pioneers and their families, clubbed together and prepared for a grand Fourth of July celebra tion. In connection with the other preparations, a barbecue had been determined upon, and when word to that effect went out, \" everybody in the county and miles and miles outside \" (to use the language of Mrs. John D. Sanford) began to fix up for the event, and when the time came, all were in attendance. Capt. James Hall was the orator of the day. H. P. Graves and Alva White were keeping a store at this time \u2014 the first at Bentonsport. John Burton and his mother kept the first hotel in the village. The first shoemaker is said to have been A. W. Harlan, Sylvester S. Henry also claims to be first. Moses Springston was the pioneer blacksmith. McHenry & Slagle kept the first harness-shop. The first wagons made here were by John and Marshall Cottle. Seth Richards was the first Postmaster. The first minister was a Cumberland Presbyterian named Williams A Mr. Conner was the earliest Constable. The first Justice of the Peace was David Tade. William Sample kept the first school. Dr. C. W. Cowles was the pioneer physician. H. H. Bucklin was the first lawyer. The first child born in Bentonsport was Henry Sullivan. The first death recorded was of a colored woman with a slave name, \" Aunt Mournin.\" She was brought here as a slave by Shapley Ross. Greef & Company were the first bankers, having conducted this business on a private plan for about six years past. Bentonsport now has a population of 600 inhabitants. The place affords three general stores, one millinery establishment, one shoemaker, one black smith, one wagon-shop, one tailor-shop, one stove and tinware and one butcher shop, and four insurance agencies. The first paper-mill built in the State of Iowa was at Bentonsport, by Green Brothers, in 1852. The concern was run until 1874, when it was closed up, and the machinery taken to Blue Rapids, Kan. In 1843. Hitchcock k Noble built a flouring-mill and a saw-mill on the bank of the river. A new flouring-mill was built in 1854 by James A. Brown, which serves the community at present. The building is of brick, four stories in height. It has three runs of buhrs. The saw-mill was run until 1866, when it was stopped. An oil-mill was put up in 1865 by James A. Brown, which served until 1867. This was the first linseed-oil mill built in Southern Iowa. It did a prosperous trade down to the year mentioned, when it was converted into a E"], [482, "490 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. woolen-mill by Brown & Moore. They continued the manufacture of cloth until 1876, since which time the mill has stood idle. The first flatboat loaded with produce that ever went out of the Des Moines River started from Bentonsport. The boat was owned by Hugh W. Sample. THE SCHOOLS. The school district of Bentonsport is an independent one. It is not within the memory of man where the first school was taught \u2014 other than that it was in a log cabin \u2014 neither the date in which teaching began. The district struggled along, however, using a building here and there, until 1870, when the Directors pur chased the academy for school purposes, for which it is still used. This academy was an individual enterprise, and erected in 1851, by John D. Sanford, H. F. Greef, James A. Brown, Seth Richards and Dr. C. W. Cowles. It cost them $3,000, and they sold it for $1,000. The district had used it before the date of purchase. The first Principal of the academy was John W. Allen. The number of scholars enrolled in this district is ninety-one, there being thirty-five in the first department and fifty-six in the second. This, as shown by the November, 1878, report. CITY GOVERNMENT. Bentonsport is an incorporated city, having become so under the Iowa code of 1851. The first Mayor of the city was George Green. The Councilmen were James A. Brown, M. O. Cresswell, C. E. Newlon, G. W. Marley and W. N. Bragg. The first meeting of which the records tell, was held January 21, 1854. The present city officers are : William Gregson, Mayor ; and Joseph Mont gomery, A. C. Rehkoph, Alexander C. Harlan and John F. Stewart, Aldermen. SECRET ORDERS.

The present officers are : J. M. Tracy, N. G.; John Grinsley, V. G. ; Joe Montgomery, Treasurer; and William Gregson, Secretary. THE CHURCHES. The people of Bentonsport began to incline religiously as early as 1841, when meetings were held about in the houses. Mrs. Sanford says : \" The first people who knocked at the door when they came to church were around in 1844.\""], [483, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 491 The first church organization was in 1843, when the Congregational society was cemented under the leadership of the Rev. Harvey Adams. Their first regular Pastor was Rev. Erastus Ripley. The denomination erected their church in 1856. This society had the first church-bell, and conducted the first Sabbath school in the place. It was a union school, yet under Congregational leadership. The society have no regular Pastor now. The date of organization of the Methodist society is not known, beyond the fact that, in the early days, Bentonsport, like all other places, was visited by various itinerant ministers, and it is not at all unlikely the seed was planted as far back as 1840. The society built their first church in 1857. The flock of the fold, which is quite numerous, is watched over by the Rev. Charles W. Shepherd. The first Pastor of the Presbyterian Church was Rev. William Harsha. The society was organized in 1853, two years after the Church erected an edifice, in 1851. There is no Pastor now. There was a Universalist society formed at Bentonsport in about 1858, and a church-building was erected. The prime movers in this cause were Henry Clay Clinton, H. F. Greef and William Quaintance. The pioneer Pastor was Rev. Mr. Ballinger. The society was continued but a few years, when it disbanded. The Universalist Church is now occupied by the Seventh-Day Adventists, who established a society in the summer of 1878. Rev. Mr. McCoy, a missionary, is the Pastor. VERNON. By crossing the ferry from Bentonsport, one is landed on the levee of the little village of Vernon. This town was laid off June 12, 1837, by Henry Smith, John Smith, S. C. Reed and Isaac Reed. It was for a time called South Bentonsport. John Allender had the first store at Vernon, and Henry Smith kept the first hotel. The first Postmaster was John M. Estes. John Allender was the first miller. Andrew Ewings had the first blacksmith-shop. The first Justice of the Peace was James Rabb. Dr. G. S. Bailey was the first physician. The first teacher in the place was John M. Estes. Samuel Clark was the pioneer minister. A daughter of Dr. Bailey has the honor of being the first child born at Vernon. The first marriage was between Dortha Smith and a Mr. Les Prouse. John Smith was the first to die within the precincts of Vernon. The village now has three dry goods stores, one general store, one drug store, one hotel, one shoe-shop, one harness-shop, two blacksmith-shops, and supports two lawyers and a physician. There is a flouring-mill at Vernon that owns quite a scrap of history. The mill was put up in 1845 by George C, Ed. and John M. Allender. It was used as a grist-mill until 1851, when the high water washed a channel through and left the old mill on an island. In 1852, the mill was brought to the shore. It was repaired, and, in 1857, George C. Allender started it as a woolen-mill."], [484, "492 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. It was successfully used for a few years and then allowed to stand idle until the fall of 1878, when a Mr. Gillett secured a contract to manufacture woolen for the Government, and began putting the old mill into condition to manufacture. George C. Allender and Freeman, in 1858, built a flour-mill which has served until the present time, with some changes in ownership. Freeman transferred his share to John D. Sanford in 1861, and Allender k Sanford was the style of the firm until 1870, when Allender sold to Benjamin Kyes. The latter sold to William Moore in 1875, and Sanford went out in the same year, transferring to B. 0. Nelson. The latter sold to Doudy, who, in the fall of 1878, released his hold and Whiting took it. The mill firm is now Whit ing k Moore. Vernon had a pottery as early as 1848, James Clark coming to the place and starting a log kiln and mud oven. In April, 1852, R. M. Dixon and J. Calinbourn came and put up a new shop and the next summer a new oven. In November, of 1852, Calinbourn was drowned in the river. Dixon run the pottery alone until 1868, when he took as a partner J. C. Grinsley. This pot tery was the first in the county. It has been a very successful enterprise. The capacity of the factory is 240,000 gallons per year. THE SCHOOL. The first school at the village of Bentonsport was taught in John M. Estes' house in 1852. In a few months, a brick schoolhouse was erected which stood until 1869, when a new one was built. It has served until the present. The school district is independent. RELIGIOUS. The structure used for the Methodist Episcopal Church of Vernon \u2014 the only church here \u2014 was erected, in 1852, for a dwelling-house by Able Choate, and was converted into a church in 1856. The Rev. I. P. Teeters was the first Pastor. Years before that, however, the faithful had worshiped in the houses of citi zens who kindly donated space for that worthy object, and the members of the society increased until the Church in question was prepared to accommodate the congregation. The present Pastor is Rev. Charles W. Shepherd. BIRMINGHAM. John Harrison, the proprietor of Birmingham, laid the place out in June, 1839. The place has grown to contain perhaps seven hundred inhabitants, and, although a railroad never belted this town with any other, there is a deal of business done here. There are three stores here, each doing a general line of business. The place is an incorporated city. The first charter was dated June 1, 1856. The first meeting was held June 3. The first officers were : President, Joseph Talbott. Councilmen \u2014 J. B. Spears, J. N. Norris, E. Pit kin. Recorder, Robert Porter. Treasurer, George Parker. A second charter was granted June 1, 1869, with H. Clay Clinton, Mayor ; Robert Porter, Recorder ; Joseph Graham, S. A. Bogle, C. C. Pleasant, F. B. Huffman and J. N. Smith, Councilmen. The present officers are : Samuel Wilson, Mayor ; Robert Porter, Recorder ; Joseph Graham, Treasurer ; George Deahl, Marshal ; F. Eichelberger, H. Barnes, D. McMillen, George Clinkenbeard and Newton Calhoon, Councilmen."], [485, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 493 A man named Berry was the first settler in the town, although Dr. I. N. Norris passed over the land where the city now stands when that plat was all grass-grown. That was in 1839. James Steel kept the first hotel here. The man Berry referred to was the first blacksmith. The first physician was William Miller, and H. C. Clinton was the first lawyer. A daughter of Dr. Norris was first to be born, while the first death was of a child of Titus Moss. Jacob Lawton was the first Postmaster, and carried the mail to Winchester. THE SCHOOLS. The school district of Birmingham has been independent since 1860. Dr. Norris taught the first school here, in 1838-39. The term was worried through in a log hut, which soon gave way to a frame schoolhouse. In 1872, a public schoolhouse was erected, and the district is now a prosperous one, employing four teachers. There is a public academy here, too. It was built in 1857, and styled the \" Birmingham Collegiate Institute.\" The enterprise was started by the Rev. Mr. McArthur, a United Presbyterian. He raised a stock company. This company at length sold the building, Rev. G. P. Bergen taking it in the inter est of the Presbyterians, who later sold it to Prof. J. W. Wolf, the present owner. The institution is a very successful one, having half a hundred schol ars on an average throughout the year. THE CHURCHES. There are four churches at Birmingham. The Presbyterians and Method ists came in 1839. Rev. Joel Arrington was the first minister who came here. He was a Methodist, and in the service of the Missionary Society. He preached in the old log schoolhouse first in 1838. He was an eloquent man, and won a wide reputation in those early days. The society of Methodists was formed in 1839. They worshiped in the log house until 1847 or 1848, when they built a frame church. That served until 1857 or 1858, when it was vacated and a larger church built. The Rev. Solomon Coles organized the Presbyterian society in 1839, the first meeting being in a barn. A church was built in 1850, and, in 1854, a new one was erected to take the place of the first one, that had been sold for a barn. The building is still standing. The United Presbyterians, at first called the \" Seekers,\" established their society in 1839. They built a church in 1848. Rev. Mr. Vincent was the first Pastor. The Free Methodist society was organized in 1874, by the Rev. Mr. Douty. The church was built in the same year. Next to the village of Bonaparte, Birmingham is probably the most impor tant town in the county of Van Buren for extensive manufacturing. The plow and wagon factory of Shott & Hope is situated here. The works were established in 1866, under the name of Shott k Brown, after which the firm became known as Moss, Shott k Brown. Then Moss went out. Finally, Brown sold his interest, and the firm became Shott & Hope. In 1856, D. C. Cramer & Co. (Cramer, Moss k Cramer) built a woolen factory. It was not put into operation, however, until about 1861. The factory was run successfully until 1870."], [486, "494 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. The saw and grist mill of Gwinn k Bott was erected in 1850. It was burned in the spring of 1854, and soon rebuilt. This, by the way, with the burning of John Barnes' house, was the only fire that ever occurred at Bir mingham. There was a cheese-factory put up in 1871, by C. L. Moss. This is still in successful operation. Birmingham had a tannery in 1868, under the management of James Glanden, Joseph Porter, \" Tanner \" Ross and John Park. The tannery run one year, when Benjamin Smith took the building and converted it into a pork packing house. He run it two seasons and then moved his business to Keokuk. The only sensation ever occurring at this place was the suicide of William Winny in 1858. He was walking with his sisters one day, in the country, and, when near a clump of hazel bushes, he stepped behind them and shot himself. There was no cause assigned for the deed. THE LODGES. Birmingham Lodge, No. 36, I. 0. 0. F., was chartered October 27, 1852, W. H. Tuthill, G. M., and Joseph Bridgman, G. S. The charter members were Samuel Fasnacht, G. A. Chittenden, Samuel Taylor, Zion Rains and Jonathan W. Sage. The membership of the Lodge is about sixty. The pres ent officers are John W. Ferrell, N. G.; J. S. Skinner, V. G.; William Hope, R, S.; D. C. Petit, P. S. Birmingham Lodge, No. 56, F. $\u25a0 A. M., was organized June 6, 1855, Simon Graham, W. M.; H. Huffman, Secretary. The charter members were Moses Bigford, J. A. Archer, J. L. Gwinn. There is a membership of forty belonging to this Lodge. The present officers are Simon Graham, W. M.; S. B. Shott, S. W.; C. L. Sheward, J. W.; J. S. Miller, Treasurer; H. Huffman, Secretary. IOWAVILLE. The village of Iowaville was laid out by a company in 1838. The Sac and Fox Indians bad sold 1,250,000 acres of land in this vicinity, and reserved two years' time on the land, after which, James Jordan, William Phelps and John Tolman bought the Indians' time for $3,000. The sale of time was made in the fall of 1837, and, in 1838, the Indians vacated, and the spring of that year, the place now known as Iowaville was laid off. Black Hawk and a few Indians remained. Phelps and Jordan were the earliest settlers, they having come in the fall of 1837. Jordan had the first trading-post. The next settlers to arrive were Joel T. Avery, John Newport, Job Carter and Crittenden Forquraen and their families, and Peter Avery, William Avery and William McMullen, bachelors. William Avery was the first Postmaster, the mail being brought in on horse back. Lauson Smith, who came later, was the first physician. The first blacksmith was Robert Rathburn. The first boat up the river as far as this point was the \" Pavilion,\" belong ing to the American Fur Company. This boat was piloted up in the year 1838. Traders' keelboats were sent down about this time. The demise of Daniel McMullen was the first in the place. Minerva Forquraen was the first child born."], [487, "495 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. Tom Gardner and Cerilda Moody were the first couple to submit to the darts of Cupid to that extent which ended in matrimony. William Avery was the first Justice and Bill Kirkham the first Constable. All now remaining of the once brisk village of Iowaville is a few houses and one or two stores. An effort was made in 1841 to build a church here, but the object was never consummated. The first preaching was by a missionary, in 1834. He came, and promised an interpreter named Frank Lavish $50 to aid him. He preached three sermons, after which the Brave of the tribe ordered him to stop ; and he did. Rev. Mr. Rowlander, a Methodist, was one of the earliest ministers who came here. The village to-day has no church. The educational plans of the neighborhood were first unfolded in 1843, the teacher being a Mr. Clark, who held forth in a log schoolhouse put up in the year mentioned. In 1857, the district became independent, and a new schoolhouse was built, which has served until the present. INCIDENTAL. James Jordon tells of a rain of seventy-two consecutive days and nights in 1831, when nearly all the soldiers and a great many Indians died of cholera. He tells of the \"roll-call\" of 1846, when, every morning, the \"grand round\" was made to ascertain if any of the settlers had been kidnapped, or deserted. He says the roll always began with \"Robert Rathburn,\" and the \" R's\" were rolled out like the long beat of the snare drum. There were no mills in those days, and for a year the settlers ground their buckwheat in a coffee-mill. This continued for a year or more, when the incon venience was relieved by the putting-up of a corn-cracker and the flouring-mill by Samuel Clayton, near the mouth of Chequest Creek, and Foster's mill on Lick Creek. THE LODGES. On the 18th day of August, 1850, at the town of Black Hawk, on the Des Moines River, opposite Iowaville, in Van Buren County, Pulaski Lodge, No. 28, was instituted, with twelve charter members. The location remained here until October 27, 1852, when it was removed to Iowaville and the name changed to Iowaville Lodge, No. 28. It remained in active operation here until September 27, 1863, when it sus pended work and remained in this condition until May 26, 1872. Then thirteen members\u2014 W. H. Cross, J. E. Alverson, B. T. Welch, T. M. Taylor, T. P. Kelley, T. Barnes, T. B. Allen, J. Beatty, E. T. Roland, D. Yeoder, J. C. Nelson, J. W. Nicholas and W. H. Nicholas \u2014 of Magnolia Lodge, No. 24, located at Agency City, on petition, were granted the privilege of removing the Lodge to Eldon and changing the name to Eldon Lodge, No. 28. The charter, in accordance with the above, was granted on the 17th of October, 1872 ; and, on the 27th of December, 1872, the Lodge was removed to Eldon, where it occupied a rented hall until!876, when it built a hall, which, with the fixtures, is valued at $1,400. Since the removal of the Lodge to Eldon, members have withdrawn to start Floris Lodge, No. 272, and Van Buren Lodge, No. 350. The Lodge now has a membership of ninety-five, all in good standing ; and has paid out in benefits $1,586.65, and has buried three of its members. On the 19th of October, 1876, Rebecca Lodge was organized, with a mem bership of eleven, and now numbers thirty-one members."], [488, "496 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. PITTSBURG. The village now known as Pittsburg was formerly called Rising Sun. This place was laid off in March, 1839, by Ephraim Warner, A. B. Williams and John Groom. In the vicinity at that time, lived John Spencer, James Duffield, Elisha Morris and Samuel Clayton. John Purdham had made the first claim in this region, and sold to Peter S. Wood, John Goodwin and D. A. Ely. A. B. Williams kept the first store, and Cyrus Gibson was Postmaster. The first blacksmith was Frank Mauk. John Groom was the first Justice, and Gain Robinson the earliest physician. James Hanshaw made the first wagons in the place. The first death was Mrs. Goodwin, daughter of Elisha Purdham. David Deffenbaugh and the widow Judd were the first couple married. The husband was a farm hand of Samuel Clayton ; the lady was a Mormon. After the mar riage, the couple went West and joined the Mormons. The first child born in this town was Ed. Janney, who is still living there. There have been several efforts made to force manufacturing interests into the throat of Pittsburg, but without success. The only business now done in the place is by one flour-mill and one store. Samuel Clayton built the first flour-mill ever put up in this vicinity, in 1836 and 1837, near the mouth of Chequest Creek- A steam mill, by William Funk, followed in 1854. In 1860, a saw-mill was added to the enterprise ; and in 1875, Mr. Funk rebuilt the mill throughout. In 1861, William Funk erected a distillery, which run three or four years, and was then closed. The following bill will serve to revive old memories : An Act to allow John Godden, Samuel Carle, John Groom, Archibald McDonald and P. M. Jan- ney, of Van Buren County, further time to construct a dam and lock across the Des Moines River, at Pittsburg, in the above-named county. Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, That John Godden, Samuel Clark, John Groom, Archibald McDonald and P. M. Janney be and are hereby allowed two years' additional time to complete a dam and lock as above specified, and a required in the sixth section of an act entitled \" An act to authorize John Godden, his heirs and assigns, to build a dam across the river Des Moines.\" Sec. 2. That the eighth section of the above named act, to which this act is amendatory, is hereby amended so as to constitute the said John Godden, Samuel Clark, John Groom, Archibald McDonald and P. M. Janney tenants in common, and vest in the said tenants in common, their heirs and assigns, an equal undivided interest in said dam, and the privilege thereto appertain ing. Sec. 3. This act to take effect and be in force from and after its passage. Approved 13th of February, 1844. The earliest school taught at Pittsburg Subdistrict No. 2, was in 1842, by George N. Rosser. The place was a round log cabin, and after one term a brick schoolhouse was put up, which served until 1854, when the present frame building was erected. The first minister in this vicinity was Rev. Newton Smith, a Methodist mis sionary. Rev. Mr. Summers was the first Presiding Elder of this circuit. There is but one society here \u2014 Methodist. It was formed in 1838. The schoolhouse was used as a house of worship until 1871, when the church was built, the Pastor at that time being Rev. Mr. Thomas. The present Pastor is Rev. Jesse Craig. There are no secret orders at this village. A Good Templar lodge was organized in 1855, but, after three years, it became defunct."], [489, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 497 MT. STERLING. Mt. Sterling, with its 300 people, keeps alive four dry goods and general stores, one harness-shop, one hotel, one shoemaker, two blacksmiths, one wagon shop, a lumber-yard and a hoop manufactory. The village is universally known as Dogtown, and the inhabitants relate how it gained its name. They say that shortly before 1840, the first arrivals in the (now) village were Horace and George Wood, who saw in the distance the rapid growth of a town, and they therefore built a saw-mill and corn-cracker near by, and awaited the result. Horace had three hounds that would devour the meal as it came from the buhrs. Nearly every man who came to mill brought two or three dogs with him, and the result was a row. At the height of a dog rumpus one day, before the town had been named, a stranger rode in. \" What do you call this place ?\" he asked. \" It has no name,\" was the reply. \" I think it is dog town,\" came the self- answer. And by that name it has gone ever since, although an attempt was once made to name it \" Wood's Mill,\" then \"Union Corners,\" and later, \"Mt. Sterling.\" A steam saw and flour mill was put up in 1855 by Hayes, Kirlin k Kirk. The mill run until 1861, when it was torn down and the works taken to Keokuk. Henry Lockhart built a distillery and saw-mill in 1851, and, after operating four years, tore the building down. A barrel-hoop manufactory was started at Mt. Sterling two years ago by J. Holingshead, and has prospered since that time. The first store at this place was kept by a man whom customs had nick named \"Yankee\" Andrews; and, although the last name was correct, the man's first name was never known. George Wood, and Mary, his sister, were keepers of the first inn. George Wood was also first Postmaster. The present one is H. E. Bradford. The first blacksmith was Reuben Pfoutz. M. C. Thatcher was first Justice. James A. Alcorn is the present one. Parnic George was the first wagon-maker. The first child born in the town was in the family of Dr. Joel Knight. And this same Joel Knight was the first physician who came to town. He put up in a bark tent down in what is now Thatcher's pasture. He had a \"specialty \" with him which he advertised as the panacea for all diseases. The medicine in question he labeled \" Dr. Joel Knight's celebrated Screw Auger Pills, one hundred in a box, one dollar per box.\" I. B. Thatcher had the first lumber-yard in the place. THE SCHOOL. Mt. Sterling began to educate its young in 1841, when Freeman Spaulding taught the first school in Carnes' log cabin, in (now) Sample's field. The next school was in a log cabin one mile southeast of town. The next was in a private cabin in town. Then one was taught on (now) James Cavitt's place, one and a quarter mile northeast of the place. The next step was the build ing of a log schoolhouse in 1850, Harry Hill being teacher. This house was burned in the winter of 1855 \u2014 the fire said to have resulted from an over heated stove, while \"the boys\" were playing poker. School was afterward kept in private houses until 1861, when the house now standing was built. Carlos S. Baker was the first teacher in this house."], [490, "498 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. THE CHURCH. There is but one church-building at Mt. Sterling. This was erected jointly by the Methodists and United Presbyterians in 1870. There had been preach ing long before this. Rev. Newton Smith and Rev. Daniel Lane, the former a Methodist, the latter a Congregationalist ; both preached at an early day, but there is no record of the date of society organization, and it is supposed these were the pioneer representatives of their respective denominations. Sermons were preached in the private house, since a hotel, but now used as a blacksmith shop. The Rev. Mr. Smith was the first Methodist Pastor in the new church. Rev. Father Amos Yeager is the present Pastor. The United Presbyterian society was organized in 1861, Rev. James Boyce being first Pastor. The Church has no Pastor now. GOOD TEiMPLARS. The largest lodge of Good Templars in the State of Iowa is located at Mt. Sterling. There are 550 members on the roll. The society was organized December 19, 1873, the originators being John A. Alcorn, John Gwinnup, Isaiah Pedat, A. H. Thatcher, D. W. Furgeson. The first President was Mr. Pedat; Ferguson, Vice President, and Alcorn, Secretary. The officers now are: Elisus Bee, President; James A. Alcorn, Vice Presi dent, and Mattie Gwinnup, Secretary. INCIDENTAL. Horace Wood has the credit of being a peculiarly liberal man. He would refuse to supply a man with meal, who offered or had money to pay for it ; but a poor man, who had none, would receive all the meal he wanted, for the mere asking. ONE MURDER. There was but one murder ever committed at Mt. Sterling. That was in 1873, the winter of which Morgan Rupe was killed during a drunken row. James Algire was arrested for the crime, but fled before the trial came off. Thus the crime was never avenged. TRADING WIVES. \"Peter Wood was a peculiar man,\" remarked a citizen of the Mount, one day, while conversing over old-time matters. \" In the year of 1840,\" he con tinued, \" Peter Wood and John Seals traded wives, or, rather, Wood got rid of one of his. Wood had brought with him another man's wife from Illinois (a Mrs. Annie Tyrrell), and, after the first two, came Wood's first wife. Seals was a single man, and for the consideration of $200 in lands, Wood induced Seals to take Malinda, his (Wood's) first wife, off his hands.\" MILTON. This place was settled by Dr. Logan Wallace in 1847. The town was laid off in 1851. For years the place consisted of a post office, dry goods store, blacksmith-shop, shoe-shop and hotel. It was not until 1865 that the town took a start, and, in 1872. the extension of the Burlington & Southwestern Railroad to this point gave it another impetus."], [491, "HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. 499 There was a Fourth of July celebration at Milton in 1854. Judge Hos kins and Dr. Elbert were the orators. The music consisted of a drum and violin. C. Wandel and Levi Hayes are both claimants for the honor of having kept the first store at Milton. H. D. Wallace was the first Postmaster. Logan Wallace was the first physician, and Thomas Hollmsworth was the first Justice. The first marriage contract was performed between Richard Abernathey and Ann Cassaday. Milton has now two drug stores, five dry goods stores, three hotels, one grocery store, one hardware store, one cabinet-shop, one harness-shop, one shoe shop, three wagon and three blacksmith shops. C. Wandel was the first cabinet-maker here. C. Feath established a successful wagon and carriage factory at this city in 1872. The capacity is about one hundred vehicles per year. CITY GOVERNMENT. Milton is an incorporated city, and has been since the summer of 1878. The first Council are now serving their term of office. The Mayor is Freeman Bell ; the Recorder is R. M. McNeal. The Council js composed of five Trust ees \u2014 A. W. Carr, J. C. Hegler, H. M. Dysart, E. Campbell, Z. Cannon and H. D. Wallace. THE CHURCHES. Rev. Mr. Post, the Baptist itinerant missionary, was the first to preach at Milton. But the Methodist society was the first organized, in 1840. The name of the first minister is uncertain, although Rev. Mr. Bryant was among the earliest who came. The Methodists built a church in 1867, at which time Rev. Mr. Coddington was Pastor. The present minister is Rev. William Patterson. The Baptists organized their society in 1841, Rev. Mr. Post officiating. Their first regular Pastor was Rev. Calvin Daughters.

There is a flour-mill at Milton, in connection with a saw-mill. C. Miller is the proprietor. He came in 1852, and erected a corn-cracker and saw-mill, and, in 1873, he built a large flour-mill with three runs of buhrs. The only notable crime ever committed here was the shooting of Charles Brewer by Garrett Thompson, in November, 1856 or 1857. The affray grew out of a debt. Thompson had dunned Brewer, and the latter, becoming incensed, fol lowed him, and Thompson shot him, claiming self-defense. He was sentenced to a term of years in the State Prison, and. after serving six months, was par doned by the Governor. Thompson was hanged a few years after that in Monroe County, for horse-stealing."], [492, "500 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. THE LODGES. There are five secret Orders at Milton.

CANTRIL is one of the most sprightly towns in Van Buren County. Its appearance is bright and speaks of life and vigorous push. It was laid out partially in November, 1871, and finished in the spring of 1872, L. W. Cantril being the proprietor. It is the smallest incorporated city in the county, numbering but 210 inhab itants, yet having been under city legislation four years. It is the oldest new town in Southern Iowa. L. W.

The first blacksmith in the city was Joseph Boyer. Cantril has one graded school. The first schoolhouse was built in 1873, with Oscar Cooley as teacher. But the district began to grow and the demand for more room had to be supplied. Hence, in 1878, a commodious house was erected at an outlay of $1,700. The district has 100 scholars. The present teachers are Mr. McLane and Ella Stonebreaker. THE CHURCHES. The first sermon preached was by John Sexsmith, a Protestant Meth odist. However, the Methodist Episcopal Church society was organized first of all, in 1872, and a church built. Rev. John Orr was the first Pastor of the Church. Rev. Mr. Patterson is the present. The Protestant Methodist society has disbanded, but while they lasted used the Methodist Episcopal Church. The Presbyterians organized a society in 1875, under the Rev. Mr. Van Ammond. They have no church, although preparations are being made to build one. The present Pastor is the Rev. Mr. Young. A corn-grinder and saw-mill combined is the only form of milling done at Cantril. This was built in 1873, by E. E. Cantril. CITY GOVERNMENT. Cantril was incorporated April 16, 1874, and the first election was held May 20, of the same year.

INDEPENDENT is commonly known as \" Stumptown.\" This from the fact that George Stump was proprietor of the place. It was laid out in the fall of 1851. The old settlers were Capt. Miller, John Sommerlot, John Saylor, William McHue, Jerre Black, John Black and Samuel Black. George Stump kept the first store in the place. The first blacksmith was Alex. Nedrow. Ely, a son of Adam Young, was the first child born ; George Stump, a son of Frederick, was first to die, and the first marriage contract was between Rob ert Gardner and Rachel Kempson. George Stump yvas the first Surveyor and the first Postmaster. Jerry Black was the first Justice, and Capt. Henry Miller the earliest Constable. Subdistrict No. 2, Independent Village, built its first schoolhouse of logs in 1852. William Monroe was the pioneer teacher. In 1865, a new frame house was put up in place of the log. There are three church societies at Independent, and two churches. Rev. John Walker yvas the pioneer minister, and after him, in 1869, the Rev. Mr. Condit was assigned here, and he organized the Methodist Episcopal Church society, which built the church. Rev. L. Carl is the present Pastor. The Protestant Methodist Church society was organized in 1872. They have no church-building, using that of the Methodist Episcopal. The Pastor is Rev. Mr. Tolbert. There was a small body of Presbyterians, who organized a society in 1873 and built a chttach. But the project was not very prosperous, and, in 1874, the church was leased by the Moravians, a few of whom came to the surface, and have continued until the present, by the aid of itinerant ministers. ODD FELLOWS. Van Buren Lodge, I. 0. 0. F., No. 350, was organized July 16, 1876, and chartered July 9, 1876. The original officers yvere G. B. Walker, N. G. ; Rankin Smith, V. G. ; George Earheart, Sec. ; William M. Walker, P. S. ; C. T. Gardner, Treas. . The present officers are W. M. Walker, N. G. ; David Stump, V. G. ; W. M. Davidson, Sec. ; Isaac N. Davis, P. S. ; R. Ritz, Treas. Sutton & Mix are owners of the steam saw-mill that was put up in 1867 by John AL Walker. There is a steam grist-mill at Independent, that was built in 1868, by G. W. Elerick k Co. In 1872, the property changed hands, coming into the pos session of S. H. Huckleberry, the present owner. The property is known as the Van Buren Mills. The village of Independent has for its officers Jonathan Nelson, Justice of the Peace, and Perry Gilbert, Constable. PORTLAND. Portland yvas another town for which great things were predicted, but noth ing ever came of it. The place was laid out in 1834, by Samuel Holcomb, Robert Leggett, David Maggard and others, and, in 1847, the plat was entered by John Alexander, Ira Claflin and 0. S. Freeman, County Commissioners."], [495, "503 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. James Pork was the first Postmaster of the town The first physician yvas David Truit. James Adams yvas the first blacksmith, and Jesse Sutton kept the first store. There is a schoolhouse here (Subdistrict No. 9). The original house was of logs, built prior to 1850. A new frame was built in 1850, and, in 1873, a third one was built. Caroline Lewis taught the first school here. There was a saw and grist mill put up in 1854. It was blown up in 1875, the accident causing the death of a Mr. Yarnel and the serious injury of Robert Green, yvho was severely burned. Portland has had one sensation. A man named Tom Way was unceremo niously taken from that place in an early day, for the crime of horse-stealing, and sent to the Territory of Wisconsin, where the prison authorities dealt with him according to the law. WINCHESTER. John Reynolds and Jefferson Cox were the proprietors and laid out the town of Winchester, on February 29, 1840. A man named Barnes kept the first store. There are now two stores here and a blacksmith-shop. A graded school was built in 1873, prior to which the district had used the old log schoolhouse, put up about 1840, and which had served until about 1850, when a frame house was built and lasted until the new house was built. The Methodist society, formed during the early settlement of Winchester, did not build a church until 1860. The building still serves. The Presbyterians organized a society in 1851, but disbanded in 1856. They had a church-building, but sold it to Steven Bextle, who tore it down and built a house with the brick. The Lutherans had a church and society in 1854, but soon disbanded. A Mr. Belnap bought the church and moved it away for use. A Masonic Lodge was established here in 1850, with Moses Bigford, W. M. A. Gregory, N. Davis, George Cupp and Jacob Archie were charter members. The present officers are : Richard Workman, W. M. ; William Whittaker, S. W. ; John Arnold, J. W.; Will Hastings, Secretary, and Christopher Carr, Treasurer. SUMMIT. \" Mt. Zion \" is the more modern term for the station known as Summit. This place was laid out in March, 1860, by John and Alexander Taylor. Seth Richards kept the first store here. The first hotel-keeper was A. J. Perviance. All' that now remains of the town is a few dwellings, a hotel, store, church and depot. The original location of the railroad, after leaving the depot, ran from one fourth to one-half mile south of the present location. It was laid over six lengths of trestle-work, from ninety to one hundred feet high, and seventy five to two hundred yards long. This continued to Kilbourn. But one acci dent ever happened here, and that was near Summit. A train of cattle-cars was passing along, when two were capsized, one falling the distance of ninety"], [496, "504 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. feet and killing all the stock excepting one steer, and he got out of the car and ran to Keosauqua. The other car was whirled across the track. There is a Methodist Episcopal Church here. The society was organized in 1870, and the church built two years later. The village chool children patronize the district school, one mile north of town. There is a well at this place one hundred and seventeen feet deep, the dig ging of which disclosed something of interest. At a lepth of one hundred feet, solid timbers were struck, and the further investigation brought up grape vines and leaves in a perfect state of preservation. Seventeen feet further down, a vein of water was struck, and the stream burst forth three feet above the surface. Summit has had a blood-curdling sensation. It occurred January 23, 1860, when an Irishman named Mike Welch nearly chopped off the head of Malachy Curry, another man with whom he had been working on the railroad. The trouble arose over whisky \u2014 or, more properly, out of a drunken row. Welch was tried, and in September, 1860, Judge Townsend sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for twenty-five years. Welch served until about 1865, when he became insane. He was sent to the Asylum, where he died about 1870. DOUD'S STATION. David and Eliab Doud laid out what is now the village of Doud, in the year 1866. The settlers at that time yve Samuel Holcomb, Nathan Tolman, David, Doud, Jr., Eliab Doud, Jack Walker, Dr. Peter Walker, John Walker, David Shelby, William Young, David Drake, William Schuyler, Moses Starr, John D. Baker, John Hill, William C. Adams, James Johnson, Eliott Baker and Dr. Boyer. W. S. Parker kept the first store. The first blacksmith was M. Martin. Eliab Doud was the first Justice, and Archable Freshwater was the first Constable. Mary A. Doud was the first Postmistress. The first physician was James Crawford and Eliab Doud was the earliest lawyer. Andrew Fink's child was the first one to die in the place ; David Doud was the first person born, and the first marriage performed between Thomas Doud and Mary Sherer. The village government of Doud is controled bv a Justice of the Peace \u2014 Eliab Doud \u2014 and a Constable \u2014 William Crawford. ' There is no form of manufactory at this place. There was a saw-mill and corn-cracker put up in 1863, by Fred Benning k Brother. The mills never did a prosperous business and were closed in 1866. The village supports one church-building, put up in 1869, by the Baptist denomination. The church was opened in 1870, Rev. Mr. Wilson being the first Pastor. Subsequently, the Methodist denomination joined with the \u00b0Bap tists, and since that time the church has served both societies. A log cabin, owned by Eliab Doud, was pressed into service as the first schoolhouse at Doud's Station, and Mary A. Doud was the first teacher. A new schoolhouse was put up in the fall of *1869 and during 1870. The build ing still stands. The district is known as Subdistrict No.\u00b010."], [497, "507 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. A lodge of Odd Fellows was organized July 17, 1878, with A. Bott, N. G. ; W. L. Reiter, V. G. ; 0. 0. Stokes, R. S. ; G. B. Walker, P. S. ; C. T. Gardner, Treasurer ; and, in addition to those gentlemen, were the following charter members : James Crawford, D. Wiesenberger, A. L. Ratcliff, W. H. Morrison, W. H. Bott, J. C. Beale, A. Benning, E. Sawvel, John Pearson, F. M. Tannehill. The Lodge is named Custer Lodge, No. 381. PLYMOUTH. Had the expectations of an ambitious company been realized, Plymouth might to-day have been one of the most prominent places in the county. Ed ward and John Colton laid the place off on April 26, 1842. Further on, an effort was made to build a dam across the river at this point, the State taking the improvement in hand. Thousands of dollars were expended on the enter prise, but it fell through. The site was just north of Farmington. A company, with 0. H. P. Scott at the head, built a fine brick hotel and a half-dozen tenement houses, at a cost of $15,000 ; but no one came to inhabit them, and together with the few stones that were put in to start the dam, the improvements crumbled, until to-day the entire enterprise is a tottering wreck. BLACK HAWK CITY. Across the river from Iowaville, in the year 1848, H. A. Davis laid off the now wreck of a town known as Black Hawk City or New Market. He put up a merchant flouring-mill, carding-mill, a distillery, store, cooper-shop and black smith-shop. The place remained above-board until 1861, when all the build ings yvere torn down. This village had its sensations, though, even to a greater extent than did some of its larger sister-towns. In the spring of 1851, during the high water, Job Carter was drowned while swimming from his house to the distillery. In the winter of 1854, Mary Washington, the wife of George, cut her throat. No reason was assigned for the suicide. COLUMBUS. This was another attempt upon the part of capitalists to build up a mighty city, but the effort failed. John B. Thompson and John R. Sparks were the proprietors of the town. ROCHESTER. This village might have become notorious, had not a little incident occurred to render it otherwise. The place yvas laid off in 1837, by M. D. Strong, J. S. Wells and William W. Corrill. On March 21, 1837, a competition began by the citizens of the place for the county seat. By the passage of an act by the Wisconsin Legislature and through the influence of certain men, Rochester was declared the county seat. Only one night was this state of affairs allowed to M"], [498, "508 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. exist. Keosauqua put in an oar, and, through the influence of Gov. Henry Dodge, the right was wrested from Rochester. The town is now defunct. BUSINESS CORNERS. Ami Adams laid out the nucleus of this business stand in 1846. There set tled around the corners at that early day Silas Gorbingham, Walter Whitten, Reuben Sperry, Wesley H. Van Osdel, Charles T. Gardner, Henry Drake, Julius Clark, Nero Herington, John Clark and William Boggs. P. Allison was the pioneer store-keeper. The first Postmaster was Charles T. Gardner. The first physician was Dr. Crawford. William Schuyler was the first Justice of the Peace. Silas Garlinghouse was the first blacksmith. The first death was that of a child-girl of David Drake ; Peter Walker and Christy Schuyler were the first, couple married, and a little girl of David Drake was the first child born. There is but one church here \u2014 Union Church. This was built in 1874. Rev. Mr. Ridenhour was the pioneer minister, having taken charge of the church when put up. The first schoolhouse erected was in 1869, but, prior to the building, a school was taught in Clark's wagon-shop. The district is known as Subdistrict No. 2. OAKLAND. This town was laid out September 9, 1857, and joined Bentonsport on the south. Samuel E. and Mercy C. Payne were the proprietors. The place never grew. UPTON. On April 14, 1852, John Upton laid out this place, on the line dividing Iowa and Missouri. The only sign of a town now is a store and blacksmith shop. The place is a sort of trading corner. UTICA. John Whetsel laid out Utica June 9, 1857. From that time until the pres ent, one store and a blacksmith-shop are the only advance the place has made toward a town. KILBOURNE. . A place formerly called Philadelphia, and afterward named Kilbourne, was laid off in July, 1839, by John Patchett. Nothing ever became of the place outside of a \" paper \" town \u2014 that is, a drawing of the shape and dimensions of the lots on paper. PIERCEVILLE was laid out August 25, 1855, by Roswell T. Dibble and Horace Dibble. Like others mentioned, the town is but a remembrance."], [499, "509 HISTORY OF VAN BUREN COUNTY. WATERTOWN. Watertown was the name of a locality laid off May 26, 1837, by John Crow, Surveyor. There is nothing left of the place. WILLETS. Willet's Station, on the Burlington & Southwestern Railroad, is the name of a stopping-place in the county. The spot was never platted. OAK POINT, in Van Buren County, is but a post-office junction at a farm-house. It was never platted. LEBANON. This place, although containing a post office, two churches, a school, store and blacksmith-shop, yvas never platted. It is but \" four corners,\" laid out on the farm of William Brooks and others. SALUBRIA has gained a history, owing to the \" Kneeland Settlement \" which occupied the plat. And although now in this county, it was not at the time the survey was made.
