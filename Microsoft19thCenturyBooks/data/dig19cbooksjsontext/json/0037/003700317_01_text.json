'T'HERE is no greater mistake than to suppose that youth is necessarily the choice period, the green spot of life. To some it has not even the buoyancy and light-heartedness which is its ordinary portion. To not a few, cares and trials come while the frame is yet in its fresh vigour, and the eyes are sparkling with their first bold, blithe look-out on the world. To almost all, youth is a power which hurries them to its goal ; the young heart is ' hot and rest less;' it will not take time to appreciate its treasures; it will not be satisfied with its goodly possession ; it is full of uncertain desires, and wayward inclinations, and passionate impulses ; it is grasping and straining and striving after a vague, uncomprehended good, an airy or omate, ill-proportioned ideal ; it is troubled with its ignorance of its own destiny, its unresolved will, its un developed circumstances. Youth is not often the cycle of peace. Do not fear then, young girls, to leave be hind you the gaily-jested-over or mincingly-mentioned epoch of your teens. Do not dread growing graver or even stouter. With ripe womanhood, and the still, mellow decline of life, are won, and often and often"], [18, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 4 only then won, rest, power, wisdom, content. There may be a great gamer in store for your future, there will be an abundant harvest if you will but sow in grace. It is a half pagan, and wholly untrue notion, to associ ate all blessedness of existence with rash, heady, crude youth. Fight the fight, and run the race, and the older you grow the more royally you will prove the conqueror, and the grander will prove your prize. But. the important question now is, how to employ this youth so as to make of its notes some of the sweet est and gladdest of the melody which began softly in the cradle, and which, if not drowned in the clang and discord of idol music and devil worship, should swell until it joins the chorus of the skies. The writer sup poses herself speaking to those who are very weak, very unstable, very erring, very imperfect, as she is ; but who are in earnest, as even ghls can be in earnest, about Christianity and their duty ; who would con their lesson and practise their calling humbly, modestly, per severingly to the end. She is aware from experience that not a tithe of girls of a contrary spirit would listen to her, even from curiosity; and they do not conse quently come within the scope of her argument. Only to them she would say, once and for all, solemnly, wistfully, and affectionately, it is a piteous sentence which they are preparing to pass on themselves \u2014 to refuse to come to the Father for life, the Elder Brother for love, the Holy Spirit for light. Idleness, disobedience, and rebellion, unless great mercy interpose, must sow the wind to reap the whirlwind. t."], [19, "Youth. 5 ' I do not know what I shall do with myself after I leave school,' says many a good girl, doubtfully and regretfully. She need not be ashamed of the difficulty ; her position is a problem of the present day. How to train the faculties of women, to gather up and employ their energies ; how to provide for them a quiet and noble sphere, at once consistent with their dependence and their dignity ; how to furnish with suitable objects the disengaged capacities and activities of mature single women, are considerations engaging a host of the great and good \u2014 enough with a blessing to bring women's affairs to a happy issue. The solution is not found, but it may not be distant. The difficulties run in this direction : \u2014 Shall the girl return to the pickling and preserving, the herb-gathering and doctoring, the primi tive housewifery and sempstresship of her great-grand mother . Shall the Protestant girl borrow a lesson from Catholic humanity, and, while she abjures asceticism, enthusiasm, and unnatural vows, become a deaconess instead of a sister of charity, have her role regularly laid down, of teaching the ignorant, nursing the sick, feeding the hungry, and clothing the naked . Or, shall she dis cover her bent like a boy, pursue her profession fear lessly and innocently, achieve independence, and from her own lawful earnings endow and cheer her own dear home, and let the rays from that centre of love and charity stream forth on every poor, stinted, burdened, desolate home on earth . Probably the solution lies in a union of the whole three : in domesticity, alms-deeds, and independence, woven into a Christian crown."], [20, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 6 But while thoughtful men are pondering women's ques tions, let girls remember that women themselves have laboured to impress upon them that the ' woman's head is the man.' Let them not forget that the great apostle would not suffer women to usurp authority; that at fathers' and brothers' and husbands' feet they should sit so loyally and willingly, resting their heads on their knees, taking them as their masters\u2014 the repre sentatives of the Great Master \u2014 and learning of them the truth in submission. Let girls especially, while conflicting opinions are at work, think more of their duties than their rights. Woman's rights ! Foolish women have made the words a scandal in the ears of the community. True and tender women in their integrity and delicacy have re volted at the term, and avowed they had enough, they had what they would, they were satisfied, they felt their lots were in their own keeping ; they would have none of such bold, boisterous, bragging advocacy. They sympathized with good old Mrs. Grant of Laggan, when she wrote, ' I have no ambition to hear the modern belles declare their \"dark sayings on the harp,'' till such time as I am convinced that they stay more at home, have less vanity, and make better wives and daughters than formerly.' It is a great fact, that under Providence a girl's lot is comparatively in her own hands. She may not have the clearness, the conviction, or the satisfaction which she. might enjoy from a direct road in life plainly set before her, and a busy heart, head, and hand improving"], [21, "Youth. 7 its rough places and its smooth ; she may sigh, long, pray, after what would be at once greater guidance and greater freedom ; but all things that are essential to her safety and happiness are hers. When her poor little head is puzzled with doubts and distractions, when her brothers and cousins laugh at her wants and distresses, and tell her that a woman should only be ornamental, that the more useless she is the more she is answering their sense of fitness, that a strong-minded woman is an anomaly, and therefore the weaker-minded she proves the better for her and every one connected with her ; when one friend is all for meditation and endurance, and another for reform and activity ; when one speaks out her experience, and another veils it to her last breath, \u2014 let the little one escape from the labyrinth by thinking not of herself, by doing what is nearest and simplest to her hand, by living as much as possible in the wellbeing of others. The intricacies of artificial life will never entangle and confound her more than she is able to bear. The ram has been caught in the thicket that will atone for her errors, as well as for her sins. If it be the Divine will that compulsory waiting and irre gular working, which men so largely ordain for women, should last as long as the universe, if actually the rule is irreversible and unavoidable, and men are as innocent of it as women themselves, nevertheless let her lift up her head, for her redemption draweth nigh.

These Papers are written with a diffident but yearning wish to aid young girls in their aim at so lofty and beautiful a purpose. They are intended to steady their views, to comfort and confirm them, to help them in trying to contemplate by the broad light of God and the gospel, some of the things which are before them. These things consist of those gifts and facul ties (in which youth is included) which necessarily and inevitably occupy much of their notice ; those pursuits which form part of the nurture and growth of the soul ; those stumbling-blocks which beset their road ; those encouragements which will enable them to lift holy hands, without wrath or doubting, which will preserve them our own bright, trusting, eager, joyous young people, till God shall please to lay upon them the responsibilities and the labours of more advanced years. OUR SISTER GRIZEL. Two hundred years ago, down in the south of Scot tand, stood an old turreted house, the home of a county family of rank and consequence. It was a grim enough dwelling, nevertheless, with slits of windows, high, steep roof, and low, battered door. The pleasure-ground was limited to a neglected herb-garden, which closely ad-"], [23, "Youth 9 joined the churchyard of a homely little parish church, so that the farm-yard and poultry-yard presented the liveliest attractions of the policies. The whole aspect of the house was bleak ; and within its damp-stained lichened walls reigned strict discipline, heavily over clouded by family reverses, troubles, and dangers. It was a hard home for a fanciful young girl, yet here was born, grew, and flourished our sister Grizel. The chill east wind swept blightingly around her, and pinched the very elder-bush by the kirkyard wall, but she and the blue-bells flourished notwithstanding. Her diet of catechism and unquestioning obedience was as ample as her diet of cake and pudding was scant, but she throve upon them both, grew up straight-backed and open-faced, and sang as she span at her wheel. Fortu nately for her, she was not the only child of engrossed parents, nor the only charge of those stern, rough, but upon the whole, not unkind servants. She had many brothers and sisters, and probably they were her benign safeguards against austerity and fanaticism ; yet it is well-nigh im possible to imagine Grizel growing up morbid and harsh under any circumstances. If all our girls were but as hardy and affectionate as her ! In these two quali ties, quite as much as in her tender imagination, lay her double success. Which of our girls has a home so barren of comfort, indulgence, and sprightliness, so burdened with sorrow as hers 1 And yet her youth, like her age, was bountiful in benevolence and joy. We warrant Grizel rose with the lark, and like the lark was made glad by the mere stinging freshness of c"], [24, "io Papers for Thoughtful Girls. the early morning. She did not grudge her morning prayers, she only grieved that she was not always so hearty in her petitions as she should have been. In order to relieve her weary, downcast mother, she presided over the thin porridge and blue milk, for even in the country mansion the distress was so great that the daily provisions were scarce. She dispensed the doles with the most upright exactness, soundly cuffed the little brother who helped himself to an additional spoonful without her permission, but took the infant sister in her lap and fed her out of her own dish. How pretty it was to see Grizel in the flaxen-haired, bright cheeked fairness and bloom of her twelve or thirteen summers, holding the year-old child, coaxing it to open its cherry of a mouth, slowly and carefully shovelling in the portion of well-mixed porridge and milk, and drum ming the baby triumphantly on the back with the handle of the spoon when the spoonful was over, in all the skilled ease and pleasure of a motherly nurse of fifty. But do you think that breakfast was Grizel's most im portant duty, or that her lessons, and her spinning, and her attempts at household economy, and exercises at cantering her pony under some laird's Jock, were the limits of her obligations'! A world wide of it. Never young girl had a more difficult part to play. In addition to sums in arithmetic, no longer theory but practice, and secrets which might have caused middle- aged heads to grow grey, little, sensible, spirited Grizel was trusted with feats of diplomacy which would have baffled wary, crafty statesmen."], [25, "Youth 11 The political and religious disorder and misery of the time were very great. Grizel's parents were of the pro testing, Covenanting party. Her father had been rash, and had anticipated the national constitutional rising which called in the Prince of Orange; he had aided and abetted, and shown his person in an ineffectual northern landing. He was pursued as a rebel, while he lay in hiding, cooped up in cramps and cold behind the false boarding of a room in his own house ; and at one time he was driven to the dreadful chill and gloom of the family burial-vault in the neighbouring kirkyard. All this while the soldiers \u2014 the dreadful 'red coats' of the enemy \u2014 were perforce quartered on the family, and shared their stinted meals. Grizel was not only cognizant of these facts, but she was employed as the chief agent in managing their complicated machinery. It is passing strange to us how the girl managed ; how she contrived to carry food and comfort to her father, who depended upon her principally both for meat and cheer; how she eluded the vigilance, and diverted the attention of the soldiers. It is said she propitiated them, and what this amounted to you will know when you re flect that your bailiff of modern days, with his bad name for harshness and coarseness, is a mild, fine gentle man contrasted with the drinking, dicing, cursing sol dier of Charles the Second's era. It is impossible to suppose that these bearded, gross, violent men could have been other than good-humoured and obliging to the child, or else she would never have effected her purpose. The truth was, Grizel had a dash of Jenny"], [26, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 12 Denison in her character ; the bright, bold, fearless little girl was an innocent coquette. She had ample sym pathies and fine discrimination. She could understand something of the original constitution of these bluff sol diers ; she had a lurking admiration for their manliness, befouled as it was with sin. She instinctively seized on what was left of truth and kindness in those case hardened, corrupted hearts. And the rude, depraved men were won by the little mistress who was not fright ened at them, who burst out laughing in their faces at any incongruity in the quantity of meat she first heaped upon her plate and then slipped into her apron. They knew her and spoke of her among themselves as the little greedy wench, who drank their healths (young sprig of Presbyterianism as she was) over the hall-table ; who stopped and asked them of their campaigns as they cleaned their belts and burnished their buckles, whistling round the front-door ; and who even sat on the kirk yard wall, and sang to them her country songs. Grizel was always famous for her songs. If our girls could sing like her, they would wile the bird from the tree. There are very contradictory opinions rife of Grizel's father. Probably he was a passionate man hard pressed ; he certainly was one of the plotters of his generation. He had small scruple in making use of his little Grizel. He not only availed himself of her wit and energy in procuring the supply of his daily wants, but he de spatched her on his difficult and dangerous errands. One can fancy that Grizel might have had little enough intercourse with her turbulent, stout Presbyterian father"], [27, "Youth 13 before his adversity. But when he lurked a sorry prisoner where he had ruled with a high hand ; when there were no more stir and strong excitement for him, but he had to endure the dismal blank of a help less and well-nigh hopeless captivity, then he must have turned to bright Grizel, watched for her light step, list ened to her prattle of her strategies, laughed his low, short laugh at her pranks, gradually talked with her of his straits as to an older person, trusted her with his desperate projects, and thought when she left him again in silence and shade, what a clever lass she was, how dutiful and devoted, not falling behind her poor, broken spirited mother one straw's-breadth. He must have wondered, with long sighs, if he would ever reach those low countries of which he talked, and sail with Grizel in those queer, fiat-bottomed boats with the gay houses on their decks, or sit smoking at the windows where the fresh waving trees shaded the dusty streets, with her to fill his pipe, and amuse him with her quick, shrewd observations on the passers-by. I cannot think that Grizel passed through the kirk yard in the mirk without sore struggles. Her very live liness was an earnest of her imagination, and she was not a girl of the nineteenth century. The Will-o'-the-Wisp spunkie had grotesque goblin terrors for her ; corpse candles like death-speals turned her blue \u2014 not fire, nor robbers, nor mad dogs could be more appalling. She was a religiously nurtured child, but her belief was, that in God's great universe more was permitted than philo> sophers dreamt of."], [28, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 14 Winking and stumbling over the grave-stones, Grizel's quaking heart was so awed and oppressed with dim super natural fear, that the very barking of the house - dogs was a relief to her. But the barking of the collies was likely to arouse the hardened, profane soldiers, so she had to send a special prayer to the minister lo keep his dogs quiet. It was well they were quieted too, for they disturbed her mother's rest, as she lay sick and faint on her ancient silk-hung bed beneath her lozenged quilt ; and they also disturbed other rest than her mother's, even her father's, Sir Patrick, lying wrapped in his horse-cloak and blankets, ill protected from the dank vapours of the family vault, where he was trying his hand at Latin psalms, to while away the time, as well as to lay the spirits of his ancestors. With her open brow bathed in sweat, and her sen sitive flesh creeping, creeping, Grizel went on her loyal errand to her father's hiding-place. Assuredly good angels watched over her, and neither gliding ghost nor mocking imp harmed her. I can compare her to none save the truest of ballad heroines, young Janet, who won her lover, Tam Lane, from the false kingdom of the fairies. Sir Patrick did not hesitate on a point or two. Once, on a push, he made Grizel be forwarded as the bearer of a letter to his fellow-rebel and fellow-sufferer, Baillie of Jerviswoode, lying in Edinburgh Tolbooth. No doubt the occasion was an urgent one ; but think of Grizel entering the low-browed, iron-studded doors of the old Heart of Mid-Lothian, with the knowledge of"], [29, "Youth 15 high treason perilling her father's head, and weighing like lead on her heart ; think of her stumbling in hei old-fashioned sacque and screen, with her crop of flaxen hair standing on end with sheer terror \u2014 stumbling along those dismal passages and by the barred windows after the gruff, impatient turnkey, who rattled his huge keys, quite dead to the playful wiles which mellowed the lazy, roystering soldiers ! Think of Grizel in the cell where Baillie sat in his soiled coat and crushed cravat, spelling out his Bible in the dim light, and mentally calculating what was like to be his short progress between the jail and the Grassmarket ! A marvel that the carrier-pigeon did not drop at h's feet. Jerviswoode must have reckoned his friend at a loss for a servant, but, with many a deep groan and angry eja culation, he read the letter, in its barbarous cipher, 'sent with speed and care by a trusty hand,' and requiring an answer to be lodged in the same innocent keeping. Another than old Jerviswoode, despondent and dis pleased, stared at Grizel as at a world's wonder. His son George, a lad of twenty and odds, looked so stead fastly at the brave, intelligent face, cowed as it then pre sented itself, that he remembered years after, across the seas, with what reluctant, pitiful eyes the child looked on his father's disgrace ; with what implicit confidence she placed her hand in his, the hand still rough, red, and chubby in its child's roughness, the hand that still swung bags and baskets and watering-pans, and flung stones and flourished sticks in games with little brothers, at putting the stone and shinty\u2014 still a boyish hand even"], [30, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 16 in its feminine roundness. He remembered how she grasped his long fingers with a boy's frankness all the way back through the prison courts and passages, and how she told him, as he lifted her on to the big-boned horse at the gate, ' the bear was in braird down at Red braes.' The sentence sounded as if she were eager to shut her eyes on this black, beetling, noisy, inhospitable town, and shut out with it all thoughts of men's scrapes and men's rage and anguish, and open them on the green fields of her years and sex. I would divide Grizel's life into separate panels, and paint them in outline copies of the full and beauti ful original. It seems she was the chief stay of the poor exiled family, when they escaped to a ship, stole abroad in disguise, and found refuge in a foreign coun try ; and when the old household were living in com parative security and peace, but in dulness, economy, and toil among the storks and frogs, fat burghers and fair Vrows of Holland. The dame her mother comes out confessedly a woman, pure and tender in her weak ness, but essentially weak and dependent on the activity and endurance of others. So does the fair, gifted sister Christina, whom Grizel loved well, but with regard to whom she lets it be seen that she was sometimes vexed, because Christina would sit up with her books and musical instrument, dreaming in her genius, doated on by her parents, while she was left to labour alone for the common benefit, unnoticed and disregarded. Girls must be prepared for these silent contrasts, harder and more trying than many a spoken grievance. But"], [31, "Youth. 17 while stem justice would summarily put an end to them, declaring that Christina ought to have descended from her heights and trod with her shrinking feet among the thorns and mire, Grizel herself saves us from this harsh ness. With large-hearted candour and many-sided charity she shames us by slaving for this sister as well as for the rest. When God, merciful in the day of his visitation, took Christina the darling, and left Grizel the drudge, tne blow struck not the parents so much as poor Gnzei to the earth. It caused the dauntless, indefatigable child, the good fairy, the sweet singer of her own songs, to crouch, sobbing, on her knees. ' But the death of her friends was always a load too heavy for her,' said Grizel's daughter, speaking long afterwards of her mother's usually buoyant spirit and energetic will. No wonder, Grizel ! What could faithful affec tion, acute wit, unflinching fortitude, work against the last enemy. All baffled, all lost there. When the yellow fogs travelled on sluggish wings across the damp flats of Holland, and suddenly seized with a chill tight hand the ' little neck ' of your dear sister \u2014 that sister who clasped hands with you, gazing with thoughtful eyes on the strange flax-fields, orchards, tile ries, and tulip-beds, and comparing them of nights with the broomy braes and hazel dens of the Scotland she would never see again \u2014 when the cold relentless grasp wrung out the young, swelling, budding life in a few gasps and spasms of mortal agony, then you sank power less as the dead before you. You did not wail nor cry :"], [32, "Papers for Thoughts il Girls. 18 you had even feeble flitting visions of submission and resignation piercing the thick pall ; for you were a godly child, who had striven to order your conversation aright and had offered God thanks and praise in many a joyous time that was gone by. But tenacious natures like yours, though sanctified by grace, will weep tears of blood ere they can relinquish their treasures. You passed through the fiery trial, and your life blossomed anew ; but one fibre of your warm heart stretched away from that time to the glorious holy heavens ; one pulse throbbed with patient but wistful throbs for en trance into the pure ranks above; for renewed com munion with one who had grown wise with a guileless but ineffable wisdom, and tender with an inexhaust ible tenderness. Grizel was a poet, too, and I suspect a stronger, sweeter poet than Christina, who has melted away without other record than the unequal balance of con temporary admiration. Hers must have been simple, spontaneous authorship, from fulness of the hear: and love of the work, \u2014 composing her songs and singing them to lighten the load of her incessant avocations. To give you an idea of what these included, I quote a competent authority : ' She went to the market, went to the mill to have their own corn ground (which it seems is the way with good managers), dressed the linen, cleaned the house, made ready the dinner, mended the children's stockings and other clothes, and made what she could for them ; and, in short, did everything.' On another occasion the same writer mentions that"], [33, "Youth 19 Grizel would sit up for whole nights to work lace ruffles, in which her brother Patrick might show himself among his fellows. To suppose this wonderful catalogue was accomplished without great bodily exertion, considerable worry of mind, and occasional crossness of temper, even in a notable woman, is impossible. Indeed, I am bound to state it is my private opinion that Grizel rather over did the thing, and insisted on being always the working horse in the family cart; an injudicious arrangement, which not only offered temptations to others, but must now and then have impaired the peace and prosperity of the household vehicle. But it was a noble fault in a noble character, and so she was often in tune to sing heartily as she worked, to carol like a morning lark while she sat up into the small hours. She was fired by the womanly affectionate ambition, dear heart, to work the lace in which her brother might ruffle with the best of the Scotch gentlemen, and not disgrace the name he bore, or smother his own comeliness. It is my impression the young laird took her offerings to his manhood very sensibly, and wondered the lace was not finer and stiffer, and that sister Grizel's devotion, which was so much a matter of course, did not perform still more shining miracles. But I can fancy the same laird, when he was no longer young but old, looking back wistfully on these very ruffles and their worker, call ing himself an ungrateful lover, and reflecting some what ruefully on the value of the treasure, which passed away from their house when they wedded Grizzie to long Geordie Baillie. In truth, what a maiden aunt Grizel"], [34, "ao Papers for Thoughtful Girls. tvould have been, what a grand-aunt, what a single lady with a lass and a lantern for her bodyguard by day and by night. In one or two senses, Grizel was lost to the Humes and to posterity by becoming a wife aid mother. There was a great gathering of douce Scotch folk in that Dutch town-hall where Sir George Baillie was troth plighted to Grizel Hume. They were exiles ; but the dry Scotch humour, the broad flashes of a strong race's hilarity, rose refreshed and shone forth in compliment to the occasion. If the troubles continued, the plenish ing would have been but poor, the housekeeping ar ranged on the most rigid principles of Scotch thrift ; but do you think for a moment such trifles could dismay Grizel . She has left to us the song which, in the char acter of a shepherdess, she sang to the accompani ment of a cracked harpsichord, while enamoured Sir George stood by her side, leaning against the great Dutch clock \u2014 its moon of a face encircled with a full blown wreath of convolvulus and roses. ' Though our toom purse had barely twa bodies to clink, And a barley-meal scone were the best in our bink ; Yet he wi' his hirsel, and I wi' my wheel, Through the howe o' the year we would fend unco weel.' With Grizel's betrothal ends her life in the Lowlands of Holland, and among the plodding Dutch. William o. Orange landed in England, and Sir Patrick Hume, and young George Baillie, and many another banished man, returned to the hillsides and holms of Scotland, and then own special haughs and knowes, and grey houses, and old folk, bonniest of all."], [35, "Youth 21 In London, or else down at Portsmouth, Grizel was wedded to George Baillie, whom she first met in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh. She rode off with him to keep his house of Jerviswoode, and keep him closest company in state or bounty. There are traces of her reign at Jerviswoode ; one piquant glimpse of her as a very old lady smiling and watching over the sports of her grand children ; but among these relics I cannot find that she degenerated into the wilfulness and imperious ness, the prejudice and arrogance in which high-spirited chatelaines are believed to end their careers. That she grazed these evils I no more doubt than that peculiar temptations assail peculiar casts of character, but I honestly declare that I do not discover these qualities prominent in Grizel Baillie the dame, any more than in Grizel Hume the maiden. True, George Baillie lived long with her, and he is said to have been a capable lord and master, but he was taken from her, and she was left a widow. Both during George Baillie's life and after his death, I maintain Grizel is the same Grizel she always was, not over much an autocrat and termagant. While she was still a rejoicing wife and mother, she bore her husband's burden with him cheerily, helped him ably to order his household and dispense his hospitality, and tried to tolerate his departures to London, to which he was called by the affairs of the Kirk and the State. However, with regard to this last cross, I notice that she fretted under it, a rare im pulse with her ; and so far from being altogether com forted by Sir George's delegated authority, she clung"], [36, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 22 to his letters, and only forgot her troubles on his return. When George Baillie died, Grizel was a sorely afflicted woman, though she had great faith that the parting was for a short season. You remember the death of her friends was always very sore to her, and to me there is something endearing in this single instance in which the strong heart's elasticity relaxed. Now, a nearer and dearer than the little sister Christina was gone. ' He was too good for me,' cried very piteously she who was so good a daughter, so good a wife and mother. At last Grizel lies stretched on her own death-bed. Here, certainly, peeps out something of far-reaching authority and high supremacy. In her last interview with her grandsons, she caused, in anticipation of their marrying wives, the last chapter of the book of Proverbs to be read to them in her hearing. The wizened and worn old woman thought to dictate to the young men on the subject that thrilled their heart strings ! Nay, it was the venerable mother on the brink of existence yearning unselfishly to bestow her coun sel on her boys with regard to the step which was the most momentous in their lives, the step which she best understood, on whose text her own history was a com mentary. The grandsons blest, the old woman turned to the wall. ' Have you anything to wish for, mother V ' No thing,' the old woman said, meekly enough, with her faltering tongue, 'except that I may be with George Baillie in the place to which I am bound ; that I may"], [37, "Youth. 23 not miss him whom my soul loved, in the many man sions of the Father's house,' \u2014 fitting last words of her who was more than a heroine of the Covenant, even a loving and loved woman, and whose best memorial still, after all that has been written, is her own sweet, quaint songs."], [38, "11. INTELLECT. T ADY Mary Wortley Montague left it as her shrewd, caustic, concise opinion that no greater obstacle could exist to a girl's prospects in the world than the reputation of talents. Therefore if a victim had the misfortune to inherit talents, Lady Mary coolly and craftily advised her to hide them as closely as possible. Poor brilliant Lady Mary ! The large, liberal spirit which brought to her country the benefit of inoculation was cramped, withered, and tainted, and none knew better the hollowness which may attend on wit. Since Lady Mary's day, opinions have altered, and standards have changed. The dangers which attend intellect in a woman are now private and per sonal ones, with which the world does not interfere ; and the blessing of it has been demonstrated so honestly and so largely, that now-a-days few even require, with Richard Lovel Edgeworth, to combat a good literary Dr. Day's antagonism to a literary daughter. Still, in one sense \u2014 that of settlement in life by mar riage \u2014 the great aim at which Lady Mary pointed, \u2014 intellect, pure weight and force and refinement of mind,"], [39, "Intellect. 25 apart from all cunning, is rather disadvantageous than advantageous to the holder. Assumed the generality of men to be of ordinary capacities, of course the proba bility of the woman out of the generality of women (that is, of extraordinary capacity) meeting her mate, is greatly lessened, although not to the extent that is gener ally supposed. For while she is apt to frame to herself a standard in correspondence with her own faculties, and to be repelled by the shallow, dull, blunt crowd around her, there is, on the other hand, often untold magnanimity in a clever woman \u2014 a largeness of heart, along with a largeness of head, which acts as an anti dote, and enables her to sink her cleverness to its due. level. ' Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever,' she murmurs. She values manliness, guilelessness, kind ness at its proper price. She marries an upright, sensible, stupid, affectionate fellow, and calls him lord and master; and the world laughs; but she is happy in an atmosphere of intensely feminine happiness, de ferring to him, honouring him, glorifying him with her whole moral nature ; and he acquires a dignity he never held before, and grows brighter and brighter under her brightness, is respectable and respected, and even his very children conduct themselves to him with a peculiar homage, moved by her delicate duty. Enough is not said and written of this submission of the mental to the moral nature ; this exaltation of virtue, this offering of the right hand and bent knee to the true man who loves God and his brother, and who. through the great sacri- D"], [40, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 26 sice and the divine perfection, shall yet reign as a priest and a king. German literature has more of this gentle ness. The popular domestic dramas of Princess Amalie of Saxony contain specimens of it. Dickens and Thack eray have noted it ; and one or two of my readers may recollect the gay, quick, pretty heiress who became en amoured of Cowper's description of his good simple minded, rustic kinsman Johnnie. Apart from her opportunities of marriage, intellect is almost an unmingled boon to a woman, unless it be of a very restless, obtrusive, and exacting description, such as to deprive her of her natural resources, weaken her fellow-feeling with her kind, or offend them by arro gance. These shadows are not uncommon attendants on cleverness, but they diminish every day. They rarely accompany true ability, but rather its showy counter feit. The reproach of a blue-stocking is becoming obsolete. We have no fantastic Anna Sewards, neither have we demure Fanny Burneys, elaborately hiding their volumes of the ' Lives of the Poets,' lest they be sus pected of the pretensions of learned ladies so impos ing and alarming as Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Montagu. A woman never 'spouts' now in public; she is no more extravagantly proud of her information, her reflec tion, her imagination, than she is exceedingly ashamed of them. They are her inheritance ; a grave, glad inheritance, to be used, not abused, never to be sported, and, after all, no great rarity. Yet while painters, poets, and writers in general are common enough among women, and matter-of-fact and quiet"], [41, "Intellect. 27 persons they are, exactly like their neighbours, still sagacious, cold Dr. Carlyle of Inveresk recorded that universal accomplishments had produced a monotony among women, and that he sought in vain, in another generation, for the sprightliness and sense so much esteemed and so patent in the female circles of his young days. He has too good ground for his com plaint. Let girls honour and cherish their intellects, laugh ing at those men-novelists who would persuade them that they are more interesting and irresistible as maidens and matrons, the more ignorant and helpless they can continue to linger. Let them arm them selves with the weapons left them by King Solomon : ' She openeth her mouth with wisdom ;' ' strength and honour are her clothing;' 'she bringeth her food from afar;' 'with her own hands she planteth a vineyard;' ' let her own works praise her in the gates.' Intelli gent ignorance, very difficult to find now, is fresh and original. Sweetness, candour, tender-heartedness, and all goodness, are as incomparably superior to any mere mental organism in a woman as they are in a man, but the case ends there. A clever good woman is a finer, abler being than a stupid good woman, not to say a silly good woman. Folk would think us mad if we took the trouble to state the same proposition with regard to men ; to cite the self- evident fact is still necessary in behalf of women. There is no merit in weakness ; nay, if you have experience of the world, you will probably agree with Dr. Arnold, that the"], [42, "28 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. large brains and the large hearts have a tendency to go together ; and that it is among the thoughtful women that you discover the utmost humility, disinterestedness, and devotion. But let young girls avoid cultivating intellect for intellect's sake. No more barren toil ; no more boot less harvest. Young girls ought to have many duties and delights ; and to cause intellect to supersede these, is to substitute what is called in Scotland a ' dry stone dyke' for a green, sweet-smelling hedge, \u2014 philo sophy for religion, head for heart. The writer has long remembered another writer's injunction to use litera ture for a means, but never for an end ; because if such a mistake is fatal to a man, it is doubly fatal to a woman. Sir Walter Scott talked of literature being a good staff but a bad crutch ; and girls should so con sider intellect \u2014 a gracious faculty, but no more to en gross them than beauty. If possible, they must find some definite object in their studies. Latin to read with a studious elder brother ; natural history to en gage a volatile younger ' callant ;' drawing to occupy a delicate sister ; political economy to amaze and amuse papa ; penetration into the best novels to lighten the short leisure, relax and soften the somewhat contracted and concentrated sympathies of mamma, or one and all to bestow on friends and neighbours. If there is no outlet for talents, no prospect of their employment, and yet a clear opportunity to cultivate them, no doubt it should be taken up in faith. Learn, as Lady Jane read Plato, to calm the ruffled temper,"], [43, "Intellect. 29 and soothe the vexed spirit, or even to allay the aching finger. Learn for what learning may be some day. Most acquirements are called into service at some period of life. Believe that it may benefit some one; that it may help to support the student ; that, at the lowest estimate, it invigorates and enlarges the mind. To learn vaguely, when it is not for intellect's sake, is soon to flounder in a sea of knowledge without rudder or anchor. The best-intentioned girl cannot continue her lessons after she has left school in this pointless fashion. To learn selfishly because some gift of fancy, reason, or memory is pleased by the ex ercise, or because it is more congenial than any plain, commonplace, tiresome, fatiguing work, is sapping self sacrifice and steadfastness, and at the outset giving way to wilfulness, self-assertion, and proud isolation. Keep intellect in its proper place as a stately, benign handmaiden, but only a handmaiden. Better and grander a thousand times the nimble fingers which can mend a rent, and mix a basin of soup to the comfort and relief of a fellow-creature, than the brain that can solve a problem for a feat, or conceive a poem for a flight. At the same time, the writer has no idea the two processes cannot be combined, and mutually improved by the union. Neither does such a conviction interfere with a girl's discovering the bent of her mind, and if possible, under religious and lov ing limitations, carrying out a peculiar and individual calling. Only do not over-rate intellect. It is no m ,rf indispensable than beauty ; it was no more"], [44, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 30 supplied where it was wanting by the Lord of good than wealth or beauty. Especially, do not overstrain a moderate intellect to do the work of a mighty one, and load it like a pack-horse till the poor, oppressed servant can scarcely stumble blinkingly along. This injunction needs to be impressed upon the reader, because many girls cannot separate intellect from duty, and many who would refrain from joining in the chase after beauty, exhaust themselves in a super human, hopeless effort to render themselves sagacious and profound. ' There is that maketh the simple wise ;' but it is not human intellect or study. Good girls will moil and toil through arguments and philosophies beyond their bear ing, and read heavy books punctually but drearily, for conscience' sake. The motive sanctifies the labour, but the labour itself is useless. Unfortunately it is a mis take which worthy friends often confirm rather than controvert. ' They do not like us to squander our time,' says many a girl ; ' they want us to read some thing solid, \u2014 essays, reviews, works of science and history. True, the essays and weighty reviews confuse us and set us to sleep ; we have no memory or power of classification to enable us to conquer the long names of scientific genera, or even the dates of history. No doubt it is not nearly so entertaining as Miss Yonge's and Miss Manning's books, and other books like them. And do you know they actually did us good : we thought of them, and behaved more generously at that pic-nic ; we were more courageous and contented for them lying"], [45, "Intellect. 31 on the sofa after our illness ; and, ah, would you believe it 1 we never have such an idea of foreign scenery and life as from some of those stories ; but you know they are only stories, and our friends like us to read solid books. Of course it is right ; and I am sure it is a pity that we have not a great taste for poetry, to appreciate Milton, for we did so like the sweet, erring, repenting life of Mrs. Mary Powell.' It is a pity that friends are not judicious, and will prescribe the same diet for all digestions, and forget that strong meat is not for babes, and that there will be babes always, as there are boobies always. It is the quackery of teachers, and the credulity of the public, that can ever cry, ' Eureka ! the institution, the man, the woman is found, under whom there are to be no more boobies.' Really wise, indulgent friends, together with a clear eye to an object in study, and a just conception of the relative value of all things, are the best safeguards here. Sir Thomas More gently advised his Margaret to desist from her attempt at a Scripture concordance, if she could relinquish it, because, although the effort was noble on her part, it was far beyond her knowledge and understanding ; and Margaret, mortified, abashed, disconsolate, wrung by the passion for so great a work, which she had excited in herself, yet yielded meekly, and reaped the fruits of her submission in future con tentment and happiness.

Dictionaries, lexicons, treatises, great and small, have not effected much more for morality.

There is one book, deep to the deepest, but which he that runneth may read, and in which the wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err. Compass it ; and after it, read what you feel you under stand and like, and are the better for, whether story, or song, or parable, or hymn. Reject, without scruple, what only makes you heavy or bewildered, self-important, and overbearing. Bear in mind, that if you have no inclination or call to deep study, it is not for you. The duties of your womanliness \u2014 the plain, simple, tender duties of affection, benevolence, and godliness \u2014 are infinitely above book craft, and they are always within your reach. Besides, you err greatly if you fancy information and accomplishments are stereotyped in printed books. They exist in the clouds of the sky, in the flowers of the field, nay, even in your own em broidery.

WHAT BECAME OF PEN . < And what will become of Pen . ' The question was asked in a company of young people who had been driven from playing cricket, and from looking on at the wickets, into the shelter of a forsaken schoolroom. Both boys and girls were at that age when they are still rejoicing in their emancipation from recent bondage ; when they will not readily re-cross schoolroom thresh olds in case they should feel once more boys and girls pulling and jerking at the leading-strings, and galling themselves with the yoke which they trust they have dropped for ever. When they do re-enter the old pre cincts, they proceed forthwith to vindicate their freedom by violating every venerable rule and precedent. The boys sit on the desks and whistle in their dogs ; the girls sit a la Turque, and speak in loud whispers of love and matrimony. You observe they are not rational, respect ful men and women, but restless, crude-minded boys and girls. This day the set came back into the schoolroom, because they could not find the key of the summer bouse; and groups of papas and mammas, like the choruses of Greek plays, occupied the dining-room and drawing-room. It was raining so heavily, that if they"], [49, "Intellect. 35 remained on the lawn they must resign themselves to being as wet as drowned cats within the hour, so that the girls would be scolded and sent to change their dresses, and even the boys would be aggrieved by inves tigations about their boots, as if they were a lot of Molly Coddles. Therefore they trooped into the disused schoolroom, and hastened to behave themselves after a fashion that would have provoked the ire of former in structors. They had no fear of raising their sensibly stolid, affected, despotic, passionate ghosts ; they quizzed the maps, they drummed on the tuneless, old piano, which would give back nothing but scales. At last they sat down on the benches in free-and-easy attitudes, and a languid wag striking his boot, as if he had been a Chesterfield, advanced from reminiscences of the past to predictions of the future. ' Tom will be a captain of volunteers, he has such a head for rows. My sister Sophy will rush into an unfortunate marriage, and then tear her hair ; she was always so abominably given to sinning and repenting ; fingering alum-baskets before they were cold, letting loose new dogs sure to run away.

' And what will become of Pen . ' asked an inquisitive voice. Pen was the single girl who had entered the school room with something like sentiment, and had continued reflective and tender : ' Here I began German. How anxious I was to get over the cases, and reach Schiller and Uhland. Yonder I read Pope's Homer's Iliad, alas ! all of the Iliad and Troy, great Pelides and Atrides, a poor girl was like to attain. On that high stool for boobies papa tried to perch himself, when Miss Lead better invited him in to hear how far she had brought me on in fractions. Papa found us working on an entirely wrong principle, but he said we had made some wonderful hits for women, and he allowed us to have the boys' friend, Mr. Allworth, to carry us through the first book of Euclid.' Pen was roused from her reverie by the mention of her own name : ' What will become of Pen?' ' I don't like to meddle with learned ladies,' protested the clever, forward boy nonchalantly, with his scorn pal pably shining through his pretended respect. ' I 'm always afraid of their subsequent revenge, \u2014 putting me into a book, or something of that sort, turning up their large noses at me, hitting me with their cold hands yes, they have always cold hands ! \u2014 and bony fingers ; but if I am forced to be heroic, I will say that Miss Pen will prove a Minerva in a garret, that is, in a good, self contained house, with two strong-minded, intellectual"], [51, "Intellect. 37 maid-servants, a moral, scientific gardener, and no end of doctors and divines, schoolmasters and missionaries revolving round her like so many satellites.' 'We told you so, Pen, we told you so, when you would ask about political economy the other day,' screamed a chorus of voices. ' I've no objection,' answered Pen promptly enough, but not quite candidly ; for it struck her coldly, with a wet-blanket sensation, that though she might be happy as an independent woman, with her faith to follow, and nature, art, and literature to cultivate ; \u2014 still, to see all the others depart from her side and contract new ties, and she alone to remain stationary and isolated, was rather a dreary prospect. Neither could Pen see any inherent necessity for the case, since she knew herself to be, in spite of her pursuits, the warmest -hearted of the circle. At this time, however, Pen was, it must be confessed, both shy and ungainly. It is almost impossible for a sensitive girl to deviate from the beaten track without a sense of oddity and rectangularity perplexing and har assing her. In spite of her mother, she had stinted her exercise for her studies, and her complexion was spoilt, and her carriage impaired. Then she happened to be large-boned ! a conformation which, in opposition to plumpness, is at its worst stage at sixteen. Altogether, Pen Hope would not strike any one as bearing the most distant resemblance to a fawn or a rose or a fairy ; she was not even a blooming, buoyant girl. Still the depri vation was neither very great nor very rare. Her de-"], [52, "Papers for Thoughts id Girls. 38 sects did not prevent her being a growing, promising girl, perfect in all her members, as her friends were thankful to see. The Duke of Argyle and Mrs. Glass, in their definition of the Deans', settled that Jeanie was not ' bonnie,' just ' sonsy.' Pen was not ' sonsy,' but she was 'wiselike,' another graphic Scotch term, literally wise-like, with capacity and sense and kindness, even in the over -prominent shoulderblades, which she had not given over hitching awkwardly. Be it said in conclusion, before dropping the matter, that it is not at all an uncommon circumstance, notwithstanding the con trary testimony of our poets, to encounter young girls, overgrown, bouncing Tom-boys, or gawky, poking slips of lath, creatures whose very youth is against them, \u2014 it is not uncommon to see such as these astonish them selves and the ill-natured world by ending in very personable comely women. Far-sighted matrons, with various motives, already saw this desirable termination in store for Pen Hope along a vista of years, and were constantly assuring Mrs. Hope that Pen would look as well as her sisters when her time came. There was no reason for disbelieving them, unless it existed in the pertinacity of the speakers, whose own daughters were so much more precocious, so much more sym metrical, so much better coloured, so much franker and smarter than Pen. It must be stated that Pen's position in her family was at this time anomalous ; she was in one sense re spected and loved, but she was in another teased and ridiculed. To shallow, ordinary minds \u2014 and lads and"], [53, "Intellect. 39 girls are usually shallow and ordinary \u2014 the least singu larity is synonymous with absurdity. No such irrever ent tyrants as these young persons. An occasional fit of absence of mind, a few instances of forgetfulness of common things, will dub a girl with girls as practically a fool.

Her parents had the most respect for her at this time, though they too were some what incredulous of the advantage of having her one bit more intellectual than the other girls. She was mostly 'poor Pen.' 'Pen, you goose,' was frequently heard from her brothers and sisters ; yet they consulted her in every difficulty, sisters listened to her opinion on their new acquaintances, brothers told her their minds on their professions. A few years made all the difference in the world with regard to Pen's standing in public and private estima tion. She was fully developed in body and mind ; she had lost the ungraceful protuberances which, sprouting out here and there, had constituted her ill-proportioned physically and spiritually. She had learned to feel at ease in the holding of any unusual gift, and to allow it neither more nor less than its plain due. What she had in keeping with her kind was so much greater than the trifles wherein she differed from them, that Pen would .lave now been the first to laugh at the notion that she"], [54, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 40 was conspicuous or outlandish. She had evidenced her talents ; she had chalked out her walk ; she had esta blished her reputation ; \u2014 a superior girl, not so much accomplished as well-informed, resolute, and persevering in all her ways, and her ways were the ways of a good, kind, clever woman. Her father and mother were comfortably off, and she did not need to work for her bread ; neither was she much required in that debatable field of housekeeping which swallows up, with such feeble results, whole bevies of worthy young women. But she experienced no absence of interest and occu pation. She was near a large city, and she attended a ladies' college and a school of arts on her own account, and with a very cordial appreciation of, and considera tion for, her fellow-students. She dabbled in industrial schools, Sunday schools, provident societies, and cottage libraries. She was a great gardener, and actually reared slips and sowed seeds for the million, striving to foster an eye for beauty in eyes that are too often accus tomed to ugliness and deformity. These were Pen's outlying concerns. Within doors she managed her mother's greenhouse and her father's aquarium. She wrote out short-hand notes of college lectures and me moranda for her brother Bill ; she filled in bulletins of home news, personal opinions, and scraps of reading for Joe to puzzle over in his Palmatta hat and shirt-sleeves, after his sheep-shearing by the Macquarrie river; she hunted out books not too dry to present information and amusement to her sisters; she was friendly to the young maid-servants; she conferred obligations on visitors, and"], [55, "Intellect. 41 contrived diversions for them when their stereotyped stock fell short of their necessities. Above all, as a key note to her upright, merciful performance, she never forgot her Bible and her prayers. The only thing that distinguished Pen Hope from the rest of the world now-a-days was this, that however much she had on hands, she was uniformly expected to do still more on any press of engagements. She was the installed bee of the family ; and when there was more honey than usual required for the daily consump tion, it was she who was incontinently appointed to fly faster and farther, and complete the deficient nectar. However engrossed you found her, she was the indivi dual to turn to with an application for immediate and prolonged assistance. She had an immensely broad back to bear a sliding-scale of burdens, as she herself instinctively perceived and acknowledged. And with all her talents, industry, and kindness, there was a guilelessness about her that kept her in the midst of all her importance free from self-conceit and self-asser tion. She was no longer the butt of the family, but she remained their best play-fellow. Of course, as one consequence of the unequal distri bution of labour in her house, Pen was a very do mestic animal. Then woe be to the man who should presume to withdraw her from her native sphere, and monopolize her manifold excellencies.

The Hopes never contemplated the possibility, although there was nothing to prevent it. They were defenceless against the enemy. Pen's face and figure had ceased to be an objection ; the big-boned, stooping, sallow girl had passed into the stately woman, who could not avoid pinning her shawls with a prestige, and whose bonnets and hats and auburn hair shaded a face, healthy in its colourlessness and thinness, as an active mind, a benevolent heart, and a busy life will, with fair play, insensibly freshen any face, however sharp and pale. She was generally reckoned a fine-looking wo man, though she had high cheek-bones. Her individual features were not anything extraordinary, but her ex pression was excellent, so composed, so ready, so trusty, and often so humorous. She had one distinct beauty. It is seldom that a young face wants one. Her hair waved like the ribbed sea-sand, so coyly, yet so archly; \u2014 its very roguishness relieving her over-grave fore head.

Married men and bachelors delighted to chat with her, but young men were rather apt to hide their diminished heads in her presence.

In fact, the head of the house was a manufacturer only partly retired from business. They had many neigh bours in their comfortable, flowery villa ; wealthy, culti vated, middle-class people in the same circumstances as themselves. The villa nearest them belonged to an orphan brother and sister, and had been let till the brother was of an age to manage his manufactory, and the sister to reside with him as his companion and housekeeper. These Bushes came at last and displaced their tenants. The Hopes were disposed to be atten tive to them, although Ned Bushe was but a good, stupid sort of fellow, and Miss Bushe was a thought less, head-strong girl. ' Look at that note, Pen ; it is as stiff as buckram,' observed Bill Hope, who was on all occasions as fluent in conversation as a Frenchman. 'He hasn't anything to say,' decided Pen, suc cinctly. ' What will a man with so few ideas do in a business V ' My dear Pen, ideas have nothing to do with a busi ness, unless you are going to turn your mind to inven tions ; and I believe you could not turn your mind to what would pay you less in hard cash, or more assuredly break your heart and ruin your temper.

He'll make a good master, and not a bad friend. I should not mind consulting him in a scrape ; you might be long in getting his opinion, a ponderous affair, but it would be the right thing at last.' Men are accurate in distinguishing between silliness and dulness. Few men of any brains can, without a stretch of charity, abide a weakling, a fritterer away of whatever is great, a being tending perpetually to petti ness and meanness. But the smartest man will allow a wide sea to a slow boat. He fathoms the soundness of the blunt brains, and relies loyally on the deliberate sagacity that is so toilsomely worked out and so desti tute of ornament. In strenuous opposition to what is frivolous and frothy, an ingenious, lively man will stick to and swear by a dull companion. Women do not carry out this analysis ; perhaps their education does not clearly define the two characters ; at any rate the large proportion of women most incorrectly confound heaviness and folly.

He remembered to ask particularly how she had amused herself during the day ; he ran sacked his bad memory to bring forth news wherewith to entertain her, \u2014 what girls he had met ; who was riding ; when Lord Conniston's marriage was to come off in St. John's.

'Not at all. He's a famous listener; he always at tends, and tries to understand, and, I declare, he comes out with dead shots occasionally. You've no idea how Ned Bushe hits the bull's-eye in his solid way, when he's had long enough practice. It is a rest to a man to sit opposite Ned. He is a better tranquillizer than the very best Cavendish. There is not a fellow I enjoy like Ned. I could suppose it a kind of earthly Paradise to sail up the Mississippi or the Nile, and shoot bisons and croco diles, and take sketches of the natives, and confide all your vague day-dreams to Ned Bushe.' 'I don't agree with you,' differed Pen, shaking hei head. ' I want no mossy bank or hop pillow, to lull me to sleep.' ' That is because you are a crotchety, cantankerous woman, full of perpetual motion, and all such spasmodic, everlasting horrors.' Pen went to see Miss Bushe for herself, and found her the quintessence of self-will, whim, and variable; health and spirits. She was incompletely educated, full of partialities and prejudices, fond of excitement, with out perseverance, and very nearly incapable of reflection. She was determined to be liked and to be happy, and she had about as little notion how to set about it as any rational creature under the sun. Finding her brother bent on her perfection and felicity, she plagued him almost out of his senses. She had not been a month at Westpark when she had taken disgusts in fifty quarters,"], [61, "Intellect. 47 and given offence in a hundred, and then she grew moped and cross and ill, and altogether, Fan Bushe, in place of being to be envied, as she had intended, was exceedingly to be pitied. That was what attracted Pen Hope to her after the other girls had discovered her to be provoking and ag gravating ; after the young men had wearied of her as a novelty, and settled that she had not sufficient beauty to carry off her humours, when her vanity was wounded, and her sincerity, the best thing about her, soured. Pen Hope, having a very full complement of men and women on her mind and heart already, could not resist adding to them this discontented, undisciplined, ignor ant girl. Fan Bushe was glad to have Pen walk across once or twice a week during those bleak, bitter March days, when her cough was at the worst, were it only to convey to her club-books, designs from her school of arts, recipes for more palatable biscuits, and more drink able gruel. At the same time, Fan was little more agreeable to Pen than to the rest of the world. She was flighty, and slighted her, she murmured and op pressed her perpetually ; but she grasped at her kind ness, and was resentful if she passed a week without coming over to inquire for her, and to expend one of her dear hours of well-earned leisure on a yawning, grumbling, spiteful girl. Fan's eyes were not opened to the extent of her debt of gratitude to Pen Hope, and the enormity of her utter indifference to it, until one day she was guilty of the wickedness and coarseness of sneering to her brother at"], [62, "48 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. good and noble Pen, and attributing to her low motives. Then, indeed, she was fairly overwhelmed by the sudden dignity and sternness of the good, clumsy, patient Ned, \u2014 the crushing emphasis with which he pointed out to her, in his plain words, that if she were not a motherless girl, a poor fretting girl, whom the world took at her own valuation as a coquette and tyrant, Pen Hope would not look near her; that Pen was a pious soul, a tender soul, and she would fain see all girls healed of their spiritual diseases, and rendered as peaceful and industrious and blest as herself. Ned Bushe could have bitten his tongue out within the hour for being so savage to his foolish, young sister ; and Fan sobbed as if her heart would break, and declared she would go away anywhere, where she was not hated, where people would understand her, and care for her. Alas ! Fan, where, if not to Westpark and Beechhill . and to whom, if not to such pure Sama ritans as your brother Ned and Pen Hope . However, Fan appeared next day considerably subdued, and in clined to be tearfully affectionate to Ned, and decently respectful to Pen Hope ; and oh, the treasures of com\" punction, faith, and fondness which Ned lavished upon her, without waiting to expose her to ten minutes' pro bation. Ned Bushe used to walk with Pen Hope back to Beechhill along the morsel of suburban road, and the two shrubberies, when he had come home from his mill, just before dinner. Pen feared the escort was a civil necessity, and antedated both her calls and her departure"], [63, "Intellect. 49 from Westpark ; but then it happened that Ned Bushe also antedated his return from his place of business. So Pen accepted the courtesy, and determined not to gape on principle, and on principle was agreeably surprised to discover that she and Ned Bushe could talk together pleasantly, like a couple of firm, familiar friends. Ned had not read many of her favourite books, was uniniti ated in a thousand mysteries of which she had delight ful inklings ; but he was possibly a few steps before her in science, and he was her match on any ground of social benevolence. It is probable that the members of the middle classes, the honest, well-disposed middle classes, are better off as man and woman than their brothers and sisters a few rounds higher on the social ladder, for opportunities of mutual interest \u2014 openings where they can alike enter and compare counsel to their mutual edification and enjoyment. Unless a man is a proprietor, or a soldier, or in the Church, or by taste an artist or a naturalist (fortuitous circumstances these last, which by no means always happen, except in novels), there is a blank between the two classes, \u2014 a blank which Parliament and public offices will not supply. To fill up this blank with operas, assemblies, promenades, is a bald process, with unsatisfactory fruits \u2014 direly bald and wretchedly unsatisfactory, when it con cerns a good fellow in the upper rank, with a head not raised above horse-flesh and sport Transplant the good fellow into the middle class, rear him a merchant, a lawyer, a physician ; and his platitudes, if they are but honest, kindly platitudes on ' hands,' and clients, and"], [64, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 50 patients, are not chaff to be cast to the winds. Neces sity, responsibility, and philanthropy have made a man of him, and he will be listened to and respected, though he should be flat and tedious. There is a vast deal that is wholesome and nourishing in our commonest humanity, and your practical people all live to acknowledge it. Pen never despised any earnest, modest human being; but she not only did not scorn Ned Bushe, she did not weary of him when he spoke of his mill, his frames, his customers, his servants. She tried to appreciate his position, she tried to offer suggestions when he asked her for them, she was aware he could not unbosom him self to Fan, and she had some intelligence on the subject at his disposal, by inheritance. Once she was rash enough to prick him on to a pecuniary risk. By some chance a secret of trade came out between the two, and Pen knew that Dillon, who had wanted in vain to deal with her father, had also applied unsuccessfully for a business engagement with Ned Bushe. The men saw him in the same light as the representative of a wrecked house ; the women regarded him in other colours, as the shamed son of a fraudulent debtor, striving in vain to redeem his credit. 'That poor Dillon !' lamented Pen. ' I wish I were a man, I think I would trust him once at least,' sighed she again ; and the next thing Pen heard was a remark of her father's, that young Bushe had been regarded as prudent, though not bright, but he would never do if he went and allied himself with disreputable people like the Dillons. Good Ned Bushe, to extend a twig to a drowning man, and"], [65, "Intellect. 51 not mind being drawn in himself over the boots ; but she trusted he would come out dry-shod in the end, and rebuke trade-caution. Her father was liberal in every thing save trade. Take care, Pen, that you be not liberal but lavish. But business men are apt to be sick of business, and to leave it behind them at their shops, and arrive at their town-houses and villas wanting only to be idle and amused. This excuse is allowed for their attachment to the emptiest and most childish women, or for their homage to the mere elegancies which are opposed to their daily roughnesses. Thus your city-men hanker infatuately after the most polished and heartless of fine ladies, \u2014 women so unwomanly that they never approach the citadel of these city-men's hearts and lives, dwell at a distance from their struggles, are satisfied with the receipt of the ease and luxury of their husbands' provi sion, and superciliously ignore their origin. Pen was considerate enough to understand this phase of a man's nature ; and when Ned Bushe sauntered and looked about him instead of straight before him, and asked after her flowers and drawings, and even made remarks on her dress, she relaxed and gossiped glibly, with a dash of originality in her gossip which, strange to say, he relished keenly, though he could not have traced it to its source. 'What news, Mr. Hope,' petitioned Mrs. Hope one afternoon, according to the custom by which we live, like the Athenians, from day to day in order to heai and see some new thing."], [66, "Papers for Thoughts il Girls. 52 ' Dillon is down again ; that's no news ; but Bushe has got a slap over the fingers \u2014 serve him right ; Bushe's house was never before brought in with any such shaky concern.' Truly, the wariness with which manufacturing and mercantile voyages can be accomplished, for scores of years and whole generations, and yet every leaky vessel steered clear of and left behind, is something wonderful. It must be a sleight of hand acquired by these money holders. ' I'm sorry to hear it, he is such a good-natured fellow, and Bill's friend ; I'm afraid he's too soft ; he ought to ask advice.' 'Security thrown to the dogs. Dillon could not stand ; every old hand and most young ones could have told him that.' Pen was conscience-struck. Doubtless, Ned Bushe could afford the loss, but to occasion it, to expose him to animadversions, to entangle him in useless, perhaps evil, generosity, \u2014 she rued her part extremely, and took herself to task with the greatest severity. What did any woman know of business ? What call had she to inter fere in Ned Bushe's concerns? She had thought herself very clever and charitable, no doubt ; but this slow, soft Ned Bushe would have managed his affairs infinitely better without her, \u2014 would have done the juster, more merciful thing in the end. Pen remem bered what Bill had observed of Ned Bushe's capacity. He was not a fool; he judged correctly, and acted firmly when meddlers let him alone. It was Pen's"], [67, "Intellect. \u00a3j first lesson in how far the practical sense of a heavy man transcends the theoretical enthusiasm of a clever woman. Pen took the first opportunity to express her abundant contrition. ' Don't say anything about it,' entreated Ned Bushe ; ' I am not sure that you were wrong yet. I have been thinking a good deal of what you said of a fellow com fortably off venturing such a sum as he could spare every year, not to encourage flash adventurers without a farthing, but to stave off bankruptcy from honest, hard pressed strugglers. I think there would be real morality in it, and it would not be bad policy either in the long run.' 'But this case was exceptional. It was past being retrieved. I did not know that at the time, but I ought not to have given an opinion,' persisted Pen. ' Don't mention it ; you can't think I grudge it. Besides, surely you know I would do anything for you.' The sentence was unmistakable, and Pen could not pass it off as a joke, with Ned Bushe striding along by her side, so red and serious. Pen was dreadfully disturbed. ' I beg your pardon, Mr. Bushe. Do not say that ; I cannot hear it.' Pen did not very well know what she was saying, but in con sideration of her confusion Ned Bushe went no further. Pen was not blind to the discomfiture and the involun tary reproach on the face that had always turned so willingly towards hers."], [68, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 54 Pen had been very indiscreet ; she who had con stantly taken such good care of herself and others, that she was confided in as fully as any old woman. She had been cruel too ; she who was in the daily habit of contriving a multitude of kindnesses. She considered the conclusion ridiculous ; but she wished the absurdity were the worst of it. She could not bear to think of Ned Bushe feeling repulsed and rejected. What pre sumption and callousness in any woman to entice and expose a strong, gentle fellow to such a fate ! As Bill had said, Ned Bushe would have borne martyr dom for the defenceless if the occasion had called for it, and now think of him left to the tender mercies of Fan when mortified and heart-sore, as men are even at the first brunt of such a disappointment ; think of him subjected to the unrestrained fire of Fan's levity and petulance ! How the steady head would ache, the big hand tremble, the grey eyes grow dim, when he reflected that he could not set that uncon scionable girl at rest, could not contribute materially to her satisfaction and enjoyment; while for his pro spect of the union and affection of a home, there re mained only that Fan's miserable selfishness. Pen could not aid Ned Bushe any longer \u2014 -not when his need was greatest. That could not be thought of; she could do nothing more for Fan, though Fan should deepen in perversity, and wander wildly into vice. She was as sorrowful as sorrowful could be. Pen thought it like Ned Bushe's generosity to come to the house with Bill immediately afterwards, to show"], [69, "Intellect. 55 that he harboured no resentment, even while he was fluttered, poor fellow, and could not speak to her. Miles Whitcock, the old acquaintance who had threatened Pen with the garret half-a-dozen years be fore, was strolling in the grounds at Beechhill with Bill and Ned Bushe. Mrs. Hope wanted Pen and a sister to join them. ' Yes, Pen, you must go, for I can't send Kate alone, and I don't want them in the drawing-room just yet ; I have got a letter to write here ; no, thank you, dear, you cannot do it. It is a few lines to go with your own letter to poor, dear Joe ; and although they are not much worth, I would not have my boy miss his mother's sentences for all the other boys on the face of the globe. I know Bill meditates bringing in these lads to tea ; but if you and Kate get your hats, and go out for a stroll, and take them round to see the dog and the pony, they'll dangle there till supper-time, if you like. I '11 not try you so far I'll come out myself and fetch you all in presently.' Pen sallied out, and walked about among the drop ping laburnums and guelder roses without much heart. Bill and Miles Whitcock were in full career on the science of history and metaphysics. Ned Bushe wa& walking silently beside them. Was he reflecting of what use were his thews and sinews without subtlety of brain ? And why did the rose smell as sweetly to him as to another, and the great, ragged house-dog, Watch, pertinaciously select his knee to rub his nose upon, when he was not fit for high-flown philosophj and poetry?"], [70, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 56 To Pen's own surprise, as well as to Ned Bushe's, she began to twit him with his attention to the dog. ' Take care, Mr. Bushe ; don't suffer Watch to usp liberties with you, or else people will suppose you consider him as your equal. You have no idea how impertinent the world can be.' Bill caught up her words, and looked round with a surprised, annoyed air; and Pen herself was scared at the idea of having been guilty of a wanton insult the moment after she had spoken. Ned Bushe crimsoned, and laughed awkwardly. ' Oh, Watch is a jolly fellow !' ' I cannot see what his jolliness has to do with your complacence, unless, indeed, you are grateful to him for not being particular in his choice.' She had repeated the offence, and she could not tell why she had done it. She felt stung and exasperated. She shut her mouth and pressed her hands together to contain herself. 'Pen, you've been walking too much to-day,' re marked Bill abruptly ; ' you're as white as paper. That horrid college will be the death of you ; I wonder my mother allows it.' ' Miss Pen, I honour your intellectual activity,' ot> served Miles Whitcock gallantly. ' Do you?' exclaimed Pen sharply ; 'it is more than I do. I cannot- see that it is much worth.' ' What, Miss Hope, you a deserter ! I thought we could always depend upon your support.' ' Did you 1 ' again demanded Pen, and still more dryly,"], [71, "Intellect. 57 sensible that she was anything but gracious. But feelin^ Miles Whitcock in her own mind to be an intolerable prig and pedant, she revolted at the idea of being baited by him. You observe, clever as Pen was, she was an impulsive woman at the foundation. Miles Whitcock was perplexed in his shrewdness. Bill thought that he had never seen Pen all ruffled as if she had rolled among nettles until this moment. Miles Whitcock continued to flatter Pen. Timeswere changed. Pen had risen in his estimation. Pen was no mean skir misher in the war of wit, and of course it was to be sup posed that she could value a worthy antagonist. ' You don't mean that you've lost faith in the empire of mind, and propose to grovel for the rest of your days in patch work and crochet ? ' ' I was very fond of patching when I was a little girl. Kate will tell you I like to crotchet yet' ' Oh I as a foil or a blind.' ' Not at all, Mr. Whitcock. To a foil or a blind I trust I would not condescend.' ' Then why in the name of wonder should you waste your fine energies 1 ' ' I'm not sure that it is wasting my energies.' ' Little means to accomplish little ends.' ' Mr. Whitcock, you remember the race between the hare and the tortoise, and which won ? I don't know what I think of the tortoise, but I believe I hate the hare.' ' I'm very glad there is mamma making her appear ance to summon us to tea,' put in Kate Hope, ' for you are too discursive and figurative for me. I cannot tell F"], [72, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 58 what you are after. Perhaps you don't know yourselves. But not a gentleman among you has offered me a nose gay, and I gather one regularly every day after dinner, and wear it as a bouquet at tea.' Pen Hope was blushing hotly. She was obliged to her mother for advancing to their relief, and she was grateful to Kate for diverting the notice from her, and coveting for herself the tiniest sprig of hawthorn rather than abide being overlooked. Poor Pen, not knowing what it was to be indebted to accidents, and the good offices of others, had never been so little mistress of her own self-respect and serenity. It had been an unfortu nate, an unhappy evening, and she was sick of it. ' Go and make tea, Penelope.' Pen could execute that office at least without incurring further distress and disgrace. No, Ned Bushe wished to assist her, and Pen must look daggers at him to get rid of him, and save herself from inflicting on him further injury. You see Pen's fetters had been assumed so recently, and still weighed so heavily, that she was yet mad enough to writhe and wrench at them. ' Miss Pen, pray make up your mind as to what you think of the tortoise,' whispered Ned Bushe, bending down to her. Pen was struck dumb ; she had never anticipated this suggestion. She became deaf too, ob stinately deaf, for the rest of the meal. Ned Bushe was assailing her at one ear. Who would have dreamt that Ned would have grown valiant ? His stature towered so big, his voice sounded so deep-toned, even in a whisper, that he terrified Pen. And there was Bill"], [73, "Intellect. 59 planting himself on the other side, uttering protests against her decoctions, clamouring for cream, and sugar, and water, and tea, in successive breaths. She had been an attentive sister to Bill all her days : it was dreadful despotism in him not to spare her this one night. Even when tea was removed, Pen could not leave the room without provoking observation, so hampered does a large family circle and great popularity render a notable woman. At last Pen rose up to look for a newspaper to which her father had referred, presented him with the wrong quotation, and, relying confidently on Ned Bushe's civility to sit out her father's elocu tion, went into the greenhouse, as if to fulfil her usual evening's inspection. But we've all heard when a modest man waxes bold, there are no bounds to his audacity. When a pacific man shows fight, he never leaves off till he is conqueror of the field. The enemy followed Pen unwarrantably, and she found, too late, that she had exchanged the comparative safety of dis regarded whispers, in the busy crowd of the drawing room, for loud speech in the stillness and solitude of the greenhouse. Ned Bushe was either magnanimous to begin with, or else he designed to throw Pen off her guard. He professed that he had only come there to second her in pulling off the dead leaves, and tying up the drooping branches ; he even lopped off a bough which had been beyond Pen's power of decaprtation, and which Bill had shamefully neglected for the last fortnight."], [74, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 60 'You would not be the worse of a strong, steady fellow constantly at hand,' commented Ned Bushe insidiously. ' You may sow and water and trim things like these, and name them by names I cannot remem ber, and see them in lights I do not perceive, but for all that, you are no more fit for the heavy, dirty work of life than a weak child like Fan.' Pen vouchsafed him no answer. ' Of course I understand that you might find a friend as sharp as I am blunt, who would electrify you to no end, but the cleverest man alive could not invest you with the privilege it is mine to bestow. Pen, Pen, I could envy you that privilege.' ' What privilege V demanded Pen, bewildered. ' That of stooping to the fellow who loves and honours you. Ah, Miss Hope, if I could but bend and dis tinguish you ?' ' Every good man distinguishes the woman he ap proves,' said Pen, in low, truthful, humble tones ; and then she burst out passionately, ' You are as bad as Miles Whitcock.' Ned Bushe looked aghast. ' Who said that I idolized intellect ; that I did not think the wisest woman that ever was born \u2014 who could cast a girdle round the globe, or dig to the foundations of the earth \u2014 only a frail, erring human being, not to be compared to a brave, righteous man V ' Pen, Pen, come out and see the glowworms,' called a turmoil of voices in the distance.

' We are no more than a race of moiling glow worms, and some of us are gifted with lamps a grain bigger than others, and of course we are charitably supposed to be dazzled with our own blaze of light.' ' If you are dazzled, Pen, won't you have my arm ?' ' I never thought that I was dazzled ; it was you that would have had me credit it.' ' Well then, dearest Pen, cannot you submit to a false accusation ?' Pen submitted : a true man's arm is not a stay for a true woman to cast off. ' It is too bad,' asserted Bill Hope, coming into the room with the calmness of despair, closing the door carefully after him, and addressing Mrs. Hope, Jane, and Kate, who were sitting at work without Pen ; ' Ned Bushe has gone and asked Pen to marry him.' Every needle was arrested, every feminine eye twinkled like a star. ' Nonsense ! ' 'Fact, I assure you.' ' What can have induced him to take that upon him ? Of course Pen has refused him ?' ' Has she ? She has referred him to my father.' ' There must be a mistake, Bill, Ned Bushe is such a great simple fellow.' ' Sharp enough for his own ends, it seems. I wish I had never introduced him to the premises. I assure you he is too slow a coach to run into an error. Be sides, I saw that somebody or other was in a mess last night.'"], [76, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 62 ' But Pen cannot do without us.' Bill laughed ironically. 'Very well, Bill, I'm sure I know we'll be stagnant without Pen ; she was always moving about, and bring ing in fresh air. But Pen has been so occupied wi.th her books and fellow-creatures, I declare to you she has no hands to speak of, except for her patterns and her letters, which will be of no use to her now ; she has in terfered very little with the management of the table, she dresses without taking much pains, and she sews very indifferently.' ' Bless you, Kate, Ned Bushe does not want hands ; for that matter he can hire them by the hundred ; he wants a head, and has got it, \u2014 the clearest head in the house,' groaned Bill. ' The clearest head in the house thrown away on a blockhead,' continued Kate flippantly. ' Come, come, Kate, that is pushing the objection too far,' corrected Bill, with a reaction to his old allegiance; ' he has a thick skull, but it is over an allowance of good material.

I 'm not sure that papa will receive Ned Bushe's offer very frankly at first ; but when he comes to con sider it, he will be glad to have Pen settled so safely, though I 'm thankful that he can provide for his girls in a pecuniary way, without needing any man to take them off his hands. Yes, and I 'm proud to say,' ran on the loving mother, with her eyes getting moist, ' Pen would not have been at a loss left without a shilling, but would have kept herself as honourably and happily as she has helped to keep others. Many good wishes will go with my dear, capable, excellent Pen.' ' But, mamma, what can she marry him for ! ' specu lated Kate. ' For his money ?

T T may seem strange to dedicate a grave paper to a skin-deep charm. We are a nation of philosophers; we are religious as well as reasonable ; yet we have only to enter into society to see that a girl's sweet face is apt to be treated as her chief jewel. There is no exaggeration intended ; it is only a fool who will take regular features and a carnation complexion in lieu of all other engaging qualities ; but in alliance with them the old song of ' My face is my fortune,' may still be loudly sung. What does a young girl intuitively desire, but to present a pleasing appearance among her companions and before her world, \u2014 to be graceful if not lovely, neat if not graceful ? They say even Madame de Stael would have pledged her intellect against Madame Recamier's beauty- Why refuse to look plainly at this second nature ? Why insist on ignoring it in spite of its universal force, and the immense expenditure of time, means, and mind which it costs ?

But mark this limit; men and women are caught by such graces, they are not retained by them. No, no ; plain and homely women, take this com fort to yourselves. Only by such truth and tender ness as may rise in floods beneath the rough outlines of your ungainly and unprepossessing features, can friends be kept and lovers held till death, and beyond death. But the secret of captivation ; the winning look, air, tone, what a gift it is ! Do not venture to deny it before Rachel loved and Leah hated ; before Job's daugh ters, with their recorded inheritance. Beauty, then, is a possession given by God ; it is in itself a blessing, and no curse. No one need be ashamed to claim it ; no one need be ashamed to cherish it in its degree. Let it be worn meekly, let it be used graciously, let it be con secrated by baptism, and there it stands like the blush of the rose, and the daisy's whiteness, to delight all eyes and hearts, to do God's work.

There is a terrible little story, either in Bos well's Johnson, or in Madame D'Arblay's Diary, of a young girl, who, in preparation for an assembly, with the view of reducing her ruddy colour to a genteel paleness, had herself taught 'blood-letting,' and prac tised the art so effectually, that she appeared in the ball-room like a ghost, the open vein burst afresh during the following night, and she lay a corpse the next morning !

What sufferings have been inflicted on them selves and others by the queens of faces ! not always intentionally, not always wittingly : ' But evil is wrought by want of thought, As well as want of heart' It was not only to answer ' the pomp of pride,' but also the demands of pampered beauty that any mitigated"], [82, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 68 original of such a picture could have been supposed to exist.

Therefore beauty has its solemn, awful side, its re sponsibility and its burden ; and when you girls sigh for it, never forget that it would be one more talent to be accounted for ; and be very sure that you trade with what talents you possess, and double them before you clamour for another. The wise man said, ' Beauty is deceitful.' His words have been drawn out, and twisted, and mistaken until worthy people have come to be very near thinking that beauty, God's gift, is no gift at all, or the Devil's gift, and, against their own unerring instincts, they have abused it publicly and prized it by stealth. Still, beauty is deceitful, and for the very reason that has given it a precedence in these essays ; because it is the most attractive gift which can outwardly distinguish a young girl ; because it is seen to a certain extent and appreciated by all, and most highly appreciated by those most incapable of appreciating any other endowment, \u2014 it is ' deceitful,' perhaps the most perilous of all goodly in-"], [83, "Beauty. 6g heritances to a woman. For a beauty, admired, courted, and caressed, exalted abroad and made much of at home in a fond reflection of her triumphs, it is probably more difficult to be sincere, unselfish, humble, patient, opposed to sense and inclined to faith, than for any other female character ; unless a poor, wretched creature, soured by ill treatment, stupid by ignorance, and mad by anguish. Addressing good, reasonable girls, need I ask if it is wise in them to pine for this temptation ? A word to the plain, the homely, the hard-favoured in all respects ; a word, cordial and not cold, honest and not false, cheery and yet sympathetic. I do not say, what many will tell you, that beauty is only skin deep ; you know that as well as I. I do not say to you, what many will assure you of, that it is of no consequence ; plain women are as much admired and loved ; only the weak or the vicious put a weight on beauty. You and I know that it is not true : we have seen or heard of the good and gifted led in beauty's chains as well as the silly and besotted ; wise men and women infatuated, true men and women tortured. But for all that, there is ample comfort for you, enough to heal your heart, and make you what you so often are \u2014 the most estimable and the dearest in the end. Ac cept a few plain, prosaic hints, and one high, pure, strong consolation. Very few have not some pleasantness in their persons , there are as few strictly ugly as strictly beautiful. The most have medium attractions, differing in value very much according to different tastes. It is probable that,"], [84, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 70 in discontent or morbid humour, you have forgotten this, and overlooked some fresh tint, some shapely fea ture, some soft outline, some arch dimple, some speak ing brightness, which, to many a one, may be quite enough to gratify the eye and warm the heart. It is even a fact, that what are ordinarily reckoned defects, to some visions are excellencies. I think Cobbett owned such a convenient perversity, and William Wordsworth was more than suspected of it. An intelli gent expression, above all a benevolent expression, peace and purity on the brow, faith in the eyes, love on the lips, will, unless in rare cases, supply the ugliest fairy with sufficient charms to constitute her the favourite godmother in the long-run. It is only the outer world which beauty affects. What heart capable of loving ever loved a good mother, sister, wife, daughter less for a sallow skin, a squint, a pro jecting tooth . It is undeniable that in existing society the want of generally acknowledged personal comeliness may limit the ties of life, may prevent sympathetic feel' ing, and leave affection unsought and unclaimed ; but it does not influence the ties which God has already formed for us, and surely there are few entirely without them. At the worst, there are the ties of the forlorn in all ranks ; the poor, whom we have with us always. Do you remember the poet's advice to the high-born beauty ' sickening of a vague disease.' (you see beauties have their troubles like other people) \u2014 ' Go teach the orphan boy to read, And teach the orphan girl to sew.'"], [85, "Beauty. 71 But I would not stop short with averring that personal defects and weaknesses do not influence us in the ties which we already grasp in defiance of them. If hearts be generous and tender, do not infirmities and bodily crosses draw the bonds of kindred and friendship closer and tighter ? Look at the mother's sacred devotion to her deformed, ay, her idiot child. Will not the manly brother regard with a vein of fond chivalry the short sighted, awkward, freckled, or red-haired sister, who is yet his darling and his good angel !

' But beware of regarding anything as too light to come under your religion. Beware of divorcing any part of your walk from your spiritual life. Remem ber the apostle's lesson, ' Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all unto the Lord ; ' and that, while we stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, it is not reverence which separates our common cares from God ; it is hardness of heart and unbelief. At this rate we will have heaven on one side and earth on another. We will have angels and the spirits of just men made perfect, dissevered from our selves and our dearest and best, from the bravest, wor thiest, and most religious of humanity, because while here below we must all follow ' The daily round, the common task ;' because we are all more or less sullied and stained by mortal error, and we forget that we are washed in an other's blood, and clothed with another's righteousness.

It is more likely that several spirits, acting on upright principle and high nurture, try strenu ously to crush out the sense of pleasure in their fair faces and lithe figures, and strive to persuade themselves that they are as indifferent to them as any veiled nun should be, as if they were clad in serge instead of silk, and crowned with a quakeress's cap in place of flowers or pearls.

'I wonder if we shall get them, Sally.' ' If we do, they will be the top of the mode, Peg, for she never has anything behind the fashion.' ' I wonder if we shall charm her ladyship V 'Sure, we can try, Sally; if we do, it will be the making of us.' Clearly, it was a mission of great importance in the girls' eyes, enough to engross them so completely, that they neither looked to the right nor to the left as they pursued their way, though more than one passenger in the dim light looked after them. Maria Edgeworth tells us, that at the Dublin Ranelagh her young sister Honor was mobbed and compelled to retire from the scene \u2014 strange distinction of royalty and beauty\u2014 on account of her personal attractions ; but these girls in the sprigged poplins, they ro*- only charmed Dublin, they turned the dogged Jonn Bull head of the City and Court of London. They were not altogether safe from notice and annoyance at this hour and in these streets, but Irishmen are gallant and Irishwomen fearless.

' I cannot do it, Peg ; she will be angry.'"], [91, "Beauty. -, -, ' Angry, child ! she is the best-natured woman in the world.' ' She will grudge her lute-strings and laces.' 'Grudge, Sally! she is so free-handed, she scatters silver coin every night among the boys and girls that run after her chair.' ' And they cry, \" We don't want your poor money , we want one of your smiles, you jewel, for they are like the dawn of day.\" But now, Peg, don't you think it is low in us to push ourselves into a player's house and borrow her bravery?' ' My dear creature, we cannot help it, it is our only hope. Such a dance as I have run to get the card to the Lady Lieutenant's, and it is plain we cannot go without fine clothes, and father finds he cannot furnish them.

' It would not be so bad, Peg,' granted Sally, like all cowardly, credulous persons, inclined to snatch at the defence of company ; ' you know you often say the more the merrier.' ' I never need folk to lead me by the nose,' grumbled Peg, ' but Sally Fortescue is good-natured when you speak her fair ; and she wants sorely, for her own ends, to be sure, to be off with her ladyship, while we want as mightily to be on with her ; so for the present we suit each other like curds and cream. Just wait a bit in the entrance, Sally, and see that you don't let any of the men look under your hood.' Away dashed the proud, sharp schemer and leader, who bore down and dragged after her the more fretful, but more scrupulous companion.

' Oh, it will be such a disappointment if we are not allowed to meet her eye, and make our fortunes,' broke in the other Sally piteously. ' If, after all, we have to stay at home and darn frills, and cry our eyes out to night !' ' I wish I were darning frills down at Deanston,' exclaimed Sally Fortescue, almost crying herself; 'but I have a great desire to help you, since you are not well off here, and could fill my place without any loss to yourselves. I saw Mrs. Woffington at the Bishop's last night. I '11 go with you.' The three hurried on a few paces, and stopped before a door. The mistress of the party knocked without a moment's pause. A slatternly lodging-house servant, slatternly, but still pleasant as only Irish women can look pleasant in rags and dirt, and hair all dangling about their ears, answered their summons. Mrs. Wof-"], [94, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 80 finglon was at home, but could see no company ; she was about to get ready for the theatre. What was to be done then . 'Tell Mrs. Woffington it is three rival beauties in trouble, who have ventured to seek her counsel and ask her charity.' ' Send them up, honey,' called a rich voice over the filthy bannisters ; ' Peg Woffington don't refuse a favour when she can grant it, and sorry a rival does she fear either.' They mounted the littered staircase, where cabbage stalks and withered nosegays tripped the feet of the great actress, and entered a parlour smelling vilely of tobacco-smoke, and used as a sitting-room and dressing room. It was run over with heterogeneous clothes, play books and play-bills, gib. crowns, and nun's beads, and cards of invitation. There was a cleared corner of the table, on which lay fragments of bread and cheese, at which the occupant of the room was still munching. Possibly it was not too untidy or unsavoury a snuggery for Peg Woffington, who was picked up by Argus-eyed Madame Violante humbly washing clothes at the side current of the Liffey. In the middle of the mess stood the people's beauty tapping her fingers on the table, and meeting with viva city the faltering gaze of the new-comers. She was dressed in the universal poplin, with no ruffles but cambric frills round her arms, and a fly- cap on the back of her head. Her face was somewhat broad, but with the perfection of teeth and eyes to which"], [95, "Beauty. 81 some faces owe so much, and with that constant succession of light and shade, flicker and flash, which belongs to a mobile expression, and invests it with a fascination which is like that of flesh and blood over wood and stone. She was buxom, brilliant, kindly ; but woe is me ! there were lines of self-indulgence already written round the flexible mouth with the milk-white glittering teeth ; and in the warm hazel eyes there had gleamed ere now evil spirits of wantonness and passion. ' I am Peg Woffington ; at your pleasure. What do you Dublin belles want with me?

Pho ! out with it, girls ; we are equals when you come to see me, and no one can say I ever turned my back on an ally, though many an ally has played a scurvy trick on me. Only don't keep me waiting; I'm his Majesty's and the country's servant, remember that ;' and Peg laughed her gay. somewhat boisterous laugh, reflecting to how many her service was slavery. ' We are the Gunnings,' declared the petitioner, auda cious enough after she had once begun, ' and this is Sally Fortescue from the south ; and after yourself we are the three top beauties of Dublin this season.'

Ashamed, Peg 1 If you had not held the dregs of a noble heart, full of free admiration of all that was beau tiful, you would have been furious with jealousy. You had reigned on your own boards ; but yours were but plebeian boards after all ; hers was to be a patrician foot stool to a patrician throne. A whole century has echoed the renown of the Gunnings' faces, and their born aristocracy of beauty ; their ivory brows ; the curl of their long brown eye-lashes ; the dimples in their cheeks of velvet, brushed with the bloom of the peach ; their fine noses and chins ; their delicate, haughty nostrils ; their throats, where the black velvet bands formed wicked contrasts with the white, firm, yet soft flesh and blood \u2014 something not cold like snow, but warm as a little bird, and mellow in its whiteness, like the white in the fur of the ermine. Peg Woffington drew a long breath of approval. ' 1 'm afeared to have any more looks,' she declared in comical consternation. But she was not frightened or vexed ; she was delighted, \u2014 poor ardent Peg ; and she fairly clapped her hands when, having gloated over the other Gunning, she finally unhooded Sally Fortescue \u2014 a face at that moment as crimson as a stock gilly-"], [97, "Beauty. 83 flower, half shy, half-vexed, yet so open, so pure, with such cool, calm wells of eyes, such a gentle placid mouth.

Shall I order them to have a ridotto in your honour?' ' Oh, no ! oh, no !

Peg was much moved ; she drew back, and covered her face with her hands for a moment, and spoke hastily, in a half- smothered voice : ' My dear, I'm not angry ; but you don't know what you've done ; you don't know how your lips feel to such a woman of the world as I am.

That night's work decided the events of three lives. The Gunnings went to the Castle ball in the borrowed plumes of Peg Woffington, and literally dazzled the assembly by the fairness of their faces. Their success might have intoxicated them ; but, as a rule, I don't find intoxication on the books of Court beauties. It is"], [101, "Beauty. 87 rather lofty and joyous elation, joined to the greed of a thief for praise and power. The sisters took by storm the listless imagination of her Ladyship, who liked to be roused; and desired to convey with her across the Chan nel an Irish gem or gems to adorn her working-closet and her back drawing-room. Sally Fortescue was suffered to excuse herself from filling the glittering, cold, hard setting, and the Gunnings consented, with all their hearts, to occupy the gaping vacancy. The famous beauties carried out such a raid, and bore off such spoil as only Irish beauties have twice in half a century wrested from close-fisted British hands. They reached the toppling summit of their ambition, until the blood royal alone defied the witchery of their sway ; the strawberry leaves, baubles next to the sceptre, were again and again laid at their feet mincing to conquest. Verily, the Duke who claimed the wide moors and parks of Clydesdale, and the proud peaks of Goatfell ; and great Macallummore, the Lord of the Isles, sub mitted to wear the same flowery chains. The Gunnings were the true queens of society. To them both wealth and rank went a begging in their time, as they them selves had gone a begging to Peg Woffington. Both sisters became famous women of quality. One sister was twice a duchess. Luckier (yes, lucky is the word we play upon), luckier lasses never entered London without a penny !

The Squire's lady lectured her soundly, but she held her child to her bosom, and from that moment she renounced the spectacles which she had lately assumed, and which bestowed so peculiarly precise and pedantic an air on her comely, matronly face. Sally bloomed on awhile light-hearted, but soon grew sedate, and became the only stay of her parents. There was a Shane O'Dyer, one of the rank crop of gentlemen-farmers, who rode and danced for a time after Sally, but he was only a gentle man-farmer of some third cousin of a proprietor. In one of the first eruptions of the rebellion his stack-yard was burnt, his cattle houghed, his hedges broken down, his cabin laid open to the wind and weather. He never recovered the injury ; for he was not a man of educated faculties and disciplined resources, but only upright and honest, frank and kind, and a mighty hunter. The match was not to be dreamt of then, though Sally was so gentle a girl, and young O'Dyer so manly and fond, and pos sibly the brightest young man in these quarters. It was be lieved the girl took the loss to heart, although not so much as he did. Indeed the poor young farmer, ruined now beyond redemption, rode a little more desperately than before, swang from side to side in his saddle with weak ness, sat shivering in his wet clothes in his tumble-down house, began to burn and melt away with fever, crept as often as he could to the hillock which commanded a yiew of the big house of Deanston, and died one fine day in his prime.

Her generous im pulses, her kindly acts were all blurred and obliterated, like stars behind inky clouds, in the progress of a life flighty and erring, and degenerating often into riot and brutality. But Peg's fitful light did not leap out in the murky night. The poor soul stopped short in her god less, unrighteous career ; she suddenly cried out that she saw the broad way and the pit to which it led, and felt herself sinking to destruction. But she had also a glimpse of the narrow road mounting up to the heights still open to her. How awful it was for her light, dancing feet to retrace the long and weary waste thick set with thorns ! What mocking voices and malignant faces tortured her on the backward journey she could have told ; but she grasped the rod and leant upon the staff ; and sincere, meek, and shame-faced in her great repentance, surely she crossed the gulf, forded the stream, and reached the shore.

The other was but an Irish diamond ; but then it was an Irish diamond of the first water ; and think what this diamond felt to be compared by the shallow French to the Bristol stone lacquered in Brummagem ! a diamond that had given back the courtliest rays, whose lustre was the perfection of refinement, and whose sensitiveness to impressions was rather increased by the fact that it was a doubtful diamond, and not an assured diamond of the mines of Golconda. And the showy-tasted, rapidly-deciding French had not the discrimination to perceive the dif ference, indeed preferred the fatter, fairer, sprightlier of the two ladies or diamonds. They say the other died of it, the diamond ! This lucky Gunning died of mortification and spite, if it was not of the effects of the paint with which she had taken to plastering and daubing the fading face once so radiant in its bloom.

I see her in the theatre or opera engaged in the wretched battle, biting her lips and writhing as if stung, beneath her outward calm, when the super annuated marquis or puppy prince is paraded in the box of the exulting rival.

Oh, mean and miserable death, tragic in its meanness since it is the dismissal of the slighted, degraded soul into an unknown region of retribution ! Far away in a castle, nigh a palace in its pride of place by the western shores, surrounded by retainers more deferential and devoted than ever were Saxon subjects, a great duchess entertained an English scholar and his complacent compagnon de voyage. The great lady had wit enough to be affable to the great English- man ; but to the little Scotchman, even under her own castle-roof, she condescended to show the cold shoulder The great lady was so touchy that she could not bring herself to forget and forgive some frivolous offence of the meddling little man's. Thus the rose-leaf that ruffled the Sybarite's couch was matched by the trifle that could fret the petted mind of a great lady, whose story had gone like a fairy tale, whose destiny had equalled Cinderella's in splendour. Such pomp and such irritability, how grand, how irksome ! I have said luckier lasses than the Gunnings never entered London. Do you think their luck was so much worth having after all, when the luckiest of the Gunnings could not find enough magnanimity to pardon a foolish man's folly ? Was this all their luck brought them to ? Poor Lady Lechmere was so weak as to die of the pin pricks of vanity and another woman's triumph ; and this great duchess showed a peevish face beneath the straw berry leaves, and carried an empty heart, in which rankled the smallest affront, though that heart beat within the state and dignity of proud castle-walls.

In the heart of Ireland, away in the corner of a big, rickety house, dwindled down into the dwelling of an agent, whose family occupied it in part, a middle-aged, serene, dainty single woman was, without the least conscious assertion of authority or influence, looked up to and tended by the whole household. Although the least domineering of women, she relished her sweet, natural supremacy ; liked dearly to confer favours in the shape of caudles and cakes, and shapes of frills and caps, and was not above receiving gifts in return ; nor above stepping in next door to look wistfully round the old bare walls, to make much of, and be made much of, by her simple, cordial neighbours. In the sanctuary of her own two rooms, that old lady \u2014 the prettiest picture of faded gentility that I can think of\u2014 used to indulge herself sometimes in turning over drawers and cabinets containing relics of the past They were not worth it ; her own antiquated brocade, the tarnished gilt buttons of the Squire, the soiled pearl hoop 'of the Squire's lady, the hunting-whip which Shane O'Dyer gained at a hunt ing-match, and insisted on depositing at Deanston, and which his heirs had likewise decided on leav ing at Deanston, because it was where Shane, poor fellow ! would have wished it to remain.

FAVOUR. 1 T7AVOUR is vain.' Yes, if it waxes a sovereign or an idol : esteemed in moderation, it proves an excellent ally. Few of us are incapable of winning favour, and few are solicitous to gain it, unless it be from base and sordid motives. Fortunately, however, flattery seems formally on the decline too. Toad eaters, like blue-stockings, are antiquarian relics ; even humble companions exist in greatest numbers in novels where they manage a good deal of intricate machinery, as the duenna does in the Spanish drama. Favour \u2014 the liking of our associates, the respect of our acquaintances, the confidence of our poorer brethren, the chief secret of our social influence \u2014 is surely worth the seeking. At one time it was elabo rately sought The notion of an attractive woman always included sweetness of temper and an obliging humour. The old favourites, such as Mrs. Delany, were models of politeness, and of real not feigned interest in their fellows. Fiction took the tone from public opinion ; and every heroine, pensive or sprightly, had a host of friends, and was distinguished by her multi-"], [109, "Favour. 95 tudinous cares for them, and, in return, their grateful devotion to her. The necessity became, doubtless, a plea for popularity, and waxed artificial and over strained ; but its absence in the present day is suffi ciently striking and objectionable. Biography and fiction now abound in good, noble, sincere, benevolent women, who are yet singularly iso lated in character and position ; who, from peculiarity as temper or principle, repel rather than attract their kind ; who begin life by scorning the opinion of the world \u2014 not the wicked world, or the great world, but the little world of their equals and acquaintances ; who will neither bear nor forbear, except as martyrs, and who constitute it rather a merit to be reckoned odd, harsh, careless, cynical. Their sole available links to their fellow-creatures depend on their generally ab sorbing affection for their families, and their laud able and untiring care for the poor. But surely our blood-relations should not engross us, and the poor are not our only neighbours. In some respects our com panions and fellows in the road of life have a broad claim on us ; and it is with that claim that this paper particularly deals. In the old-fashioned days of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers, there was a great profession and practice of friendship, breathing of shepherdesses' hats, clematis bowers, and syllabubs. ' The companions of youth ' were then more frequently ' the friends of old age.' Now, friendship is a thing which it is to be feared many young girls don't think of. except as a"], [110, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 96 convenience and an amusement ; and when the con venience and amusement pass, the bond is summarily dissolved. As to sticking to an old friend, who, like the crown of England once in a day, may be 'hid in a bush,' cherishing her, bearing with her, adhering to her long after she has ceased to be prosperous, advantageous, or even very enlivening \u2014 alas ! how sel dom it is well done, how often it is not done at all. And the want of this sincerity and fidelity lends a pecu liar hollowness and meanness to many girls' friendships, deteriorates their natures, degrades their whole beings. These nominal friendships are most frequently seen in false, pretentious sets and families, full of vain and paltry ambitions ; but they are also seen where they ought in consistency never to show their faces. Ah me ! to see the young girl, when she ought to be freshest - hearted, cunningly courting the girl she con siders the best-born or the richest in her school or society ; and woe is me ! for the heartlessness with which she will turn from this queen for another who has more court patronage or a wider territory. In soliciting or neglecting favour there are necessarily two extremes to be avoided ; the constant pursuit of company, and the determined avoidance of company. The hankering after society, the inveterate coveting of a stranger's presence in the family group, the running after this or that neighbour \u2014 are largely the results of thoughtlessness, emptiness, and silliness. But remember the two last cannot be cured, they can only be leavened and salted, if possible, with good. In Jane Austin's novel"], [111, "Favour. 97 of Persuasion, Anne Elliot early sees the impropriety of the perpetual unceremonious visits, the daily ' looking in' between the hall and the cottage of the Musgroves senior and the Musgroves junior ; but she judges rightly that she cannot correct them, that her part is to render them as harmless and peaceable as possible. Such an outside life produces the effects seen on continental nations : a broad dash of national character, with scanty individuality or intensity of any faculty or feeling ; an absence of much fond, true fellowship ; a very light harvest of the human heart. But you must never forget that, with regard to some dispositions, this light harvest is the only one of which they are capable, and what is left to us is to try hard to have what is of it good, and not mixed with blight and mildew. A perpetual drop ping of visits is like gossip, which must receive very varied treatment. A great deal is written in a whole sale way against gossip, yet we cannot resist doing honour to Mrs. Stowe for having honestly, cheerily, and charitably defended it. Malicious gossip is evil speak ing, and is breaking a commandment \u2014 away with it ! Kindly and thoughtful gossip is incidental to our in terest in, and contact with our race, and is an abundant source of dramatic perception. Talk of fashions, habits, accidents, economy, babies, and the weather, is the limpid flow of a large number of minds ; and shame upon any mind, however strong or however stored, which cannot readily relax to it and luxuriate in it. There is nothing common or unclean, there is nothing really trifling which affects humanity ; the greatest will be the tenderest"], [112, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 98 Shakspere was a universal sympathizer. Sidney Smith could chat with every man, woman, and child in his parish, and be honestly engaged with them, and so the acute critic and the inveterate joker was beloved with an affluence of affection by high and low, grave and gay, young and old. And, by the bye, there is an affec tation of condescension which makes curious reserva tions. A great lady will be familiar with a peasant's wife on her milk and meal and kail-yard, when she will not understand a merchant's wife's anxiety to have the courses of her dinner served according to established rule and precedent, or to get a carriage-sweep cut out of her pretty flower-garden . Clever men will boast rather of playing with children, when they will scout their plodding mothers, or pragmatic fathers. This is far enough from the courtesy to all men ; the delicate divining rod, which pierces every temper and constitu tion, and finds there still something that is human, some thing that may be divine. Charles Kingsley, in writing of the goodwill and fer vour with which women become missionaries to the lower classes, asks, But who will become a missionary to the girls of the middle-class, to the giddy, gadding girls, the coarse-minded, spiteful girls, the proud, discontented girls who help to fill their ranks ? In the forms of edu cation \u2014 the grammars and text-books \u2014 the girls of the middle-class are as well trained, and sometimes better disciplined, than the girls of the higher classes.

But if ' a touch of nature makes the whole world kin,' a touch of grace does still more to promote an advancing and indis soluble union. A good girl in the middle class, labour ing to have a godly spirit, an upright mind, loving ways, wholesome tastes, has this superiority over her sister : she is hardier, more independent, and more original. She is not so propped up by artificial aids ; she is not so much the individual of a class, carried away by a class movement, full of class prepossessions and prejudices, High Church because she is high-bred, and showing a great and laudable charity when she can act gently and tolerantly to Low Church and Dissnet. And what a young girl in the middle class may be, above all, to her companions ; how she may promote higher tastes, how she may put down lower aims, how she may insensibly and unobtrusively strengthen and enlighten the weak and ignorant, by removing erroneous impressions, confirm ing fleeting impulses, and, possibly, at last, assisting in the great deed of casting the anchor within the veil, \u2014 all this renders the question of favour a serious and lofty one. The writer would be the first to allow, sorrowfully, that there are many good and true women who, from constitutional reserve and diffidence, or from some un conquerable defect of tone and carriage, feel a blank, as it were, between their associates' instincts and their own, and never attain this favour. Be it so, if it is not their own fault There are other weapons to work with than"], [114, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 100 mere favour or liking; and occasionally the most pas sionate attachment of a life, the deepest-rooted influence of a human history, may be drawn forth and exhibited at last by one who won no favour, but the reverse, in the beginning. But those who have natural spirit, sweetness, bright ness, persuasiveness, are vested with a social lever, and ought to use it heartily to raise the general body of their society. Of course to do any good with this favour, it must be exerted with wisdom, long-suffering, and, most emphatically, with simplicity and humility. But grand and sweet as these accompanying qualities are, they are certainly to be found if sought at their source. Judge for yourselves, then, whether should a good girl sit in her room reading a book of whatever sort it may be, which she is conscious improves her, meditating upon her day's lesson, her duty, the kingdom of nature or the kingdom of art ; say should she do this, or walk abroad with the foolish friend who is chagrined and depressed at the disappointment of a love affair with some one still more shallow and foolish than herself? If the staid but gracious Jane or Anne will listen and condole, the Dulci bella has a fancy that she would rather go fern-hunting or leaf-gathering just now, than shopping or walking in the direction of the railway terminus, the pier, the coach station, or the cricket-ground, with her sisters all chatter ing without regard to her, or laughing at her for her pure folly. On the other hand, perhaps Dulcibella has a glimmering of an idea that she might care to hear about Jane's or Anne's engagements, their work, their books,"], [115, "Favour. 101 their religious and charitable societies, just because she is heart-sick of her own round of life, and she would draw a breath of another atmosphere. Who knows but that single draught may, with a blessing, refresh and quicken her jaded, torpid, trifling spirit ?

There is nothing more commendable and enjoyable in Anne Grant of Laggan's moralizing, than her early conviction that her own love of retirement, and what was then called elegant sentiment, and her aversion to commonplace society and commonplace pursuits, proceeded from a feeling very nearly akin to selfish ness. To act beneficially on our neighbours, by our power of inspiring favour, we must keep under our own vanity; we must be very careful that philanthropy has the place of love of popularity ; we must be earnest to maintain a pure heart and a single eye. But first and last, as the head and tail of our commission, we must reverence our neighbour ; we must not think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think, and while we measure her by ourselves, we must make"], [116, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls 102 every allowance for different growth and culture, oppo site motive and temptation. While we finger the mote in her eye, we must remember, with awe, that there may be a beam in our own, and pray that we may see the great obstruction, and work first on our own grievous infirmity, with all our own might and Another's might, ere we lend to our fellow-creature our gentle, humble, compassionate assistance. We must reverence our neighbour, think well of her, bear long with her, be pitiful to her, and never, to our dying day, presume to judge or condemn her. If there is an offence more detestable than another, it is to be foul-tongued with regard to those with whom we voluntarily keep company, with whom we share bread and salt, to whom we speak with accents of goodwill, even of affection. If there is a thing to make a man or woman sit down well-nigh despairing of human kind, it is to join in a cordial greeting between friends, to hear of mutual benefits conferred, nay, sacrifices incurred, and when one has parted from another, to find the re maining person coolly and coarsely pull the absent one to pieces, expose his or her frailties, rake up or conjure into being his or her meannesses, frauds, vices.

They were a grave, grey family in a small squire's house, near a country town. They had suffered wrong and sorrow ; it does not signify what, but it sufficed to drive them in upon themselves, and to withdraw them from society. Living thus alone, they lost heart even in themselves. They allowed their pretty house, close by a stream \u2014 a house that Izaak Walton might have loved ; a two-storied white house, with a porch and an abundance of woodbine and traveller's joy, to get over grown, dark, damp, and positively unwholesome. They planted no new flowers in the borders, and the old degene rated into mere buttons of flowers ; they allowed the old avenue to sink into a miry, unfenced country road. The same was the case with their persons ; they wore old fashioned coats and gowns, always of the same colours ; and these colours waned ever fainter and dimmer, as if the persons who selected them, like owls shrinking from the light, felt all that was bright gradually become more and more unsuitable to them. They attended no public place save the church, and the vicar was a man well up in years, who never struck out a novelty in his sermon : and they read in no book-club or library.

Only one individual at Craythorpe visited the Knights of the Brook, and he was a Knight also, though a Knight springing from a different source. His father and mother did not share his entrance into the chill, shady house. They had been mixed up with the cause of the Knights' retirement from the world ; rightly or wrongly, the Knights of the Brook blamed the Knights of Craythorpe for an explosion and exposure which was very bitter to their proud, reserved natures, and a family estrangement followed. But no family estrangement could prevent Matthew Knight, the doctor's son in Craythorpe, from being the heir-at-law in entail of his cousin, Thomas Knight, the small squire of the Brook, and some intercourse had taken place in consequence ; an intercourse beginning in lawyers' offices, and ending in the scarcely less cold, formal, old-fashioned drawing room of the Brook. Thomas Knight, though a morose man, was just in his dealings, and he did not wish to visit the iniquity of the father on the child.

There had been contest there once, but there was calm now, a dead calm. Lizzie Knight, in her close-fitting grey gown, with the sleeves buttoned tight at the wrists, her hair pressed to her face, passed behind her ears, and screwed into a knot behind, believed Matthew Knight the impersonation of manly dash and daring. She herself was a flower in the shade ; a stinted, scentless flower, with mere traces of fair proportions and free fragrance ; but she had never been so conscious that her life was a species of vegetation, as when Matthew Knight was studying anatomy in France and Germany, and no visitor from Craythorpe disturbed the utter monotony of the Brook. Yet Lizzie said little or nothing to Matthew, and was the least demonstrative of his undemonstrative cousins. After all, it was strange that she, who might have been a nun for all she knew of society, and was as demure as a nun in her manners, was fully persuaded that there were other and very different spheres from the niche she occupied. It was not from the conversation of Thomas and Mildred ; it was not from the prattle of old servants \u2014 old servants are gone-by indulgences ; the Brook servants were all young, and constantly changing their places, though complaining of nothing beyond the intolerable dulness and the ineffable distance that separated them from their master and mistresses.

He was one of those men who are belligerent from their birth, and who, while they are too reasonable or good to refuse to be dis ciplined, contest every step of the progress, punch with their heads, square with their fists, shove with their feet, throughout the process.

It was a day when country-people troop to towns to spend their wages, and cheery voices sound from laden carts and half-thatched stacks. The Brook only looked the sadder for the bright luxuriance and gratitude of the world. The cart-road, between the lines of trees, leading down from the high road, was all rutted into furrows and troughs, and well-nigh impassable ; but as no wheel* drove there except in broad day-light on Sunday, where was the use of filling up the hollows and smoothing down the heights, far less of mending them with road metal? The Knights' bones were well accustomed to being shaken, and there was still a bridle-road left for Dr. Matthew. The garden was dark and disconsolate.

'I am not a bit tired; I have only travelled a hundred and thirty miles to-day; I can walk to the railway again without the least fatigue, it will be quite a pleasure ; I had lunch at the station al ready, I assure you I had, Cousin Lizzie ; for I was as"], [126, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 112 hungry as a working man, with having a run on the rail so early in the morning. I would be so vexed to dis turb you, though I should like to make your acquaint- ance.' ' No, no, you must not go away ; not at least until Thomas and Mildred have seen you,' responded Lizzie, with a shy, halting attempt at kindness, putting her thin, straight-lined hand lightly on the girl's shoulder. ' Very well, Cousin Lizzie,' answered the visitor ac quiescently, turning round, clasping one arm round Lizzie's neck, and kissing her with a warm girl's mouth. Poor Lizzie blushed all over again one of those pur plish, watery blushes. Nobody kissed another at the Brook. Thomas and Mildred had not kissed her above twice in their lives ; once when there had been inexplic able misery in the house, which no child could fathom, though Lizzie had experienced a scared perception of it which she remembered and understood long afterwards. Then, Thomas and Mildred had come into her room one night, and kissed her solemnly, one after another, with blanched lips, as if they adopted her into their communion, and registered a vow in which she was in cluded. At another time when she was thrown from her pony, and had lain for ten minutes insensible, Thomas and Mildred kissed her in an effusion of thankfulness. Of course, every one is grateful and glad over an escape from a dangerous accident and its sad consequences. Dr. Matthew on this occasion held her hand after he had ceased to feel her pulse, and involuntarily smoothed her hair when he had done moistening her brow, and"], [127, "Favour. 113 no man could accuse Dr. Matthew of a caressing tendency. It seemed quite a matter of course to Ciss Berry that she should kiss her cousin, and chat to her all the way up stairs, and during the time that Lizzie was reaching down the key from the projection above the door. 'Have you thieves here in this country place?' asked Ciss. ' No,' answered Lizzie ; ' but there is never any one here, and Mildred thinks it better to keep the door locked, as it creaks in the wind ; and it is easy to go up every day and air the room.' ' Our rooms never want airing ; that is, they have very often people occupying them to air them for them selves. You remember there are a good many of us, Cousin Lizzie ; and since Dick and Do married, we have either one or other of them, or their babies, or their connexions staying with us very frequently. Be sides, the girls that I was at school with come and see me ; and the girls that were Anne's and Chatty's con temporaries come and see them ; and papa and mamma have their acquaintances, and thus we can be seldom long alone.' Lizzie was mute, reflecting on this unexampled dis sipation ; while Ciss tilted off her hat with one jerk of her hand, drew off her cloth jacket and appeared in a muslin one, buckled round her waist like a boy's with a bronzed leather belt ; shook out her net, and looked comically at her boots."], [128, "ii4 Papers for Thoughts d Girls. ' You keep shocking bad roads, Cousin Lizzie. Are you never spilt ?' Lizzie looked wildly uncomprehending. Ciss laughed again the girlish laugh that had been trained but not restrained. ' You must forgive me for speaking slang ; all girls who live among boys do, a little, you know ; though mamma says that they never thought of such a thing when she was young. Oh, no ! they were precise and sensible people ; and mamma talks yet of \" true blue,\" and \" beaux,\" and \"happy couples.'\" ' We don't go from home,' ventured Lizzie. 'Many persons don't visit much,' chimed in Ciss, meaning to meet her sober kinswoman ; ' and some women are frightened to travel by themselves. I don't dislike it at all for a little bit, though I think I should feel lonely if I went alone for a great way, but I believe I could do it We talked of it last year when Dick's wife was very ill on their tour in Germany. Mamma was ill herself, and needed Anne, and Chatty was with Do, and my sister-in-law has no near relations. I was the only one that could be spared, and I could speak a little school French and German on a pinch. Papa was unavoidably engaged, and could not accompany me ; but if she had not been better by the next post, I was to have been put on board one of the London and Rotterdam steamers, whose captain would have seen me into a Rhine boat, and then there would have been no difficulty, for Dick and his wife were at Cologne.' Lizzie trembled ; she trusted her young cousin was"], [129, "Favour. 115 not altogether lost to feminine modesty; but how hard must be the hearts and minds of her reckless parents ! ' I am ready to go down now,' intimated Ciss, plea santly, feeling if she did not give some such hint to her cousin with the crossed hands, and the long, perfectly un ornamented, black silk apron, the necessary move would never be accomplished. But Ciss flew back again next moment, as if she had run in and out of that bees'-waxed, tightly-tied up apartment, from her earliest infancy. ' Excuse me, pray look here, Cousin Lizzie ; my trunk is at the station, for, you know, you might have been from home ; I only carried this bag, because it contained a few presents which I hoped you would accept, and which I would have left behind me in your absence. You see I meditated this invasion the moment I looked at Bradshaw, the night before we left Limerick, and I had still light to go out and buy a few trifles.' ' Oh, dear ! you should not have thought of such a thing,' protested Lizzie, in trepidation. \u25a0What was she to do with presents ? How could she receive them from a stranger whom she had never seen before that day ? She had her allowance of pocket money from Thomas, and spent it with Mildred's advice, and it just covered her expenses ; nay, she was obliged to be economical in shoes, which she walked over, in a manner that Mildred could not account for. She sometimes saved enough to buy a half-pound of"], [130, "Tapers for Thoughtful Girls. 116 tea, or a yard of flannel to a poor woman ; that was all she knew about gifts; but this independent, joyous girl had her presents like her journeys, at her finger ends. ' Here is a coronet for you, Cousin Lizzie,' holding up a roll of blue velvet ; ' the butterfly-bow on the top of the head is the height of the fashion. And this apron is worked with French silks. I hope you like the French silk embroidery ; I thought it might suit Cousin Mildred, as mamma fancied one last year,' and Ciss glanced doubtfully first at the mushed, rounded, gay wreathed little apron in her hand, and then at the long, black stripe of the same denomination patronized by Lizzie. ' I trust my Cousin Thomas carries a flask, or a telescope, or a pocket-map, when he goes on an ex cursion, for I could devise nothing for him except one of those leather-straps and Japan cases which papa found so serviceable. I am afraid it was a bad idea ; but gentlemen are so difficult to fit with presents, they cost me one night's rest going and coming every journey, and at least a week's peace of mind at Christmas. ' But Thomas never goes excursions ; it would be of no use to him ; keep it for some one else,' exclaimed Lizzie, only struck with the incongruity of associating heavy-featured, slouching Thomas, in his faded coat, with that bright yellow band, glittering buckle, and beetle-backed little box. Lizzie had no tact, no capacity, for reading her neighbours' thoughts, and accommodating her own to them : though she was gentle, she was not agreeable."], [131, "Favour. 117 Ciss's face fell for a second, but the cloud passed instantaneously. 'Never mind; it was very stupid of me not to procure something better. I must get another recipient for my strap. \" It's not lost that a friend gets.\" You are acquainted with that proverb? I should not care to keep it to myself; I have never anything handy;' and Ciss buckled it over one shoulder, and looked so far the nattiest little tourist that ever started for the mountains. ' Oh ! ' cried Lizzie. ' Dear ! It's quite common !' Ciss assured her. ' Girls cany their waterproof cloaks and their pencils by such means constantly. I saw girls with them over and over again, when we were at the Lakes.' ' Irish ! ' murmured Lizzie, as if she were saying ' Egyptian.' ' Not at all ; they were strangers like myself. I wonder you have never tried the plan ; before I knew of it, I had always to borrow one of the boys' fishing baskets to convey my traps ; there again, Cousin Lizzie, I'm afraid you consider me a romp or an Amazon !' ' Oh, no !' hesitated Lizzie ; ' but I'm not very familiar with young people.' 'And you one of them?' remonstrated the undaunted Ciss. ' Do try on your coronet, and convince me that I have not been mistaken in all my enterprises.' Lizzie fumbled about the velvet with trembling fingers ; but Ciss nimbly relieved her of the adornment, arranged it with her own expert hands on Lizzie's head, standing on tiptoe pulling and pinching and patting at the stuff,"], [132, "118 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. and, in her zeal, inflicting a good many smart tugs and twitches on Lizzie's fair hair, dressed according to a mode in utter discordance with the rich roll above the purpling face. Lizzie stood like a victim ; she was so sensitive all over, that even a strain to that over-fine flaxen hair caused the tears to rise in her eyes, and Ciss was unconsciously occasioning her torture. ' There now, Cousin Lizzie, I do declare you would not know yourself.' Certainly not. Lizzie Knight had never in all her life before seen herself under the guise of a patient, dejected queen. She stood before the oval mirror half fascinated, half disconcerted. 'You're like some character I've seen on the stage. Who could it be? Not Queen Mary, of course, or Cleopatra ; Cleopatra would be dark, like me. Oh ! Queen Katharine ; King Henry's forsaken Queen Katharine ; Cousin Lizzie, you're her picture.' To tell a sedate, formal woman of seven-and-twenty that she represents a tragedy-queen to the life, does not tickle her vanity, or meet with her approval. Lizzie began quickly to disembarrass her head, but Ciss arrested her. ' I must have the cream of the beverage first, Cousin Lizzie;' and Ciss kissed Lizzie again amidst roguish laughter. Lizzie did not like it much ; she thought it was taking a liberty with her, though Ciss was not a child, was not above four or five years Lizzie's junior ; at the same time there was something strangely novel and attrac-"], [133, "Favour. 119 tive in the fearless familiarity and fondling affection of the girl. Lizzie walked down stairs with Ciss in her white jacket and netted hair; saw her sit down in the window before the spindle-shanked work-table ; heard her re mark on the view, and ask if dahlias and hollyhocks would not grow in the Brook soil, as if the scene was a dream. After all, Thomas and Mildred were not so amazed, stunned, and thrilled with the apparition as Lizzie had been ; though they were a white-haired, ashen-faced man and woman now, they could recall the time when such visions had not been rare at the Brook ; they could avail themselves of long slumbering experience and company manners, once formed, and still in existence, though fallen into extreme disuse. Ciss broke the even tenor of their life, and they were plagued how to dispose of her without outraging hospitality and the ties of blood ; but they did not hold their breaths, or flush into a fever like Lizzie. And it was extraordinary how soon the Knights became disburdened of the fretting sense of a charge in which they could neither give nor receive satisfaction from the untoward occurrence of having a gay young girl suddenly landed among them ; how soon they grew reconciled to the presence of a stranger, on ground untrodden by strangers for a score of years , how soon they learned to welcome the bright face at their elbows, the disposition, habits, dress, so unlike their own, and sported so lightly before them. It car only be accounted for by the innate, indestructible socia-"], [134, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 120 bility of human nature, and by the exceeding pleasant ness of Ciss Berry. Perhaps Lizzie longest resisted the charm, was offended by the girl's ease, and jealous of the simplicity with which she made herself at home at the Brook, and proffered services, which it had been formerly her sole part to pay, but which Thomas and Mildred now allowed from an interloper with flickering smiles. Ciss, the new-found relative of a fortnight's existence, claimed favours which Lizzie never ventured to solicit from her natural protectors in all these years ; and the care-worn, taciturn elders granted them after scarcely a moment's discussion, with still smoother brows and blander mouths. It seemed to Lizzie that as old people delight to sit in the rays of the sun, so Thomas and Mildred liked to bask in this girl's cheerfulness. It was doting in them ; it could not but pain Lizzie. But Lizzie took herself to task for the unamiable giudge, and rapidly found herself yielding to the broad attraction. You sometimes hear it said of a man or woman, that the individual can make himself or herself happy any where, and thence, it may be added, this person is popular everywhere. Ciss was such a one ; I would like her character to be rightly understood, if I could make it plain. It was no more perfect than her irre gular face, with its brunette richness, and its limpid blue eyes ; but it bore with it more elements of influence, it effected more marvels than many a nature far higher and deeper. My notion is that Lizzie Knight's nature, cramped as it was, was the finer of the two ; but Lizzie"], [135, "Favour. 121 was entirely seif-concentraled, and, unless indirectly never touched others. Ciss was mercurial, volatile, vain, I am sorry to say, \u2014 vain with that sweet vanity which craves approbation rather than admiration, affec tion rather than passion. I believe one source of her unexpected appearance at the Brook was her ambition for universal conquest. She had heard of her cousins as morbid, inaccessible people, and she was spurred upon her fate by the desire to achieve a famous victory. She was not profound, she was not sensitive, she was not constant with the devoted constancy of full, still natures. There was a light in which she, as ' everybody's body,' disappointed and vexed you. But although you were angry with her for being as happy to-day with the indi vidual who is your antipodes as she was with you yester day ; though you were hurt to hear how speedily she had forgotten you, and how blithe she had been without your presence, while you had been moping in her absence ; still, I would have defied ninety-nine out of the hundred to have steeled themselves against Ciss's loveableness. She was as welcome as flowers in spring, which, though they blossom for other eyes than yours, and have a fleeting perfume, you prefer to June roses. The reason lay in the circumstance that she was delight ful from a most gracious virtue. I have told her faults first, my ' wandering darling,' because I don't want to impose her upon you as better than she really was, be cause I want to point out to you a truth that may wound you sharply one day, if it break upon you unawares. The praise of man is not like the praise of God ; it is K"], [136, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 122 not given to the worthiest, the most self-denying, the most laborious ; it is given to certain qualities which bind a man to his kind, \u2014 qualities which are in them selves desirable and valuable, but which are not the holiest or the highest. Ciss had large confidence in her fellows; she had an immense stretch of sympathy with them. Such a faculty of faith, though it was an unquestioning, super ficial, sometimes almost irreverent faith ; such a power of interest, though it was a temptation to latitudina rianism and desultoriness, was a low, smirched edition of the Apostle's ' all things to all men,' and was a vast gain to her even as it was to the inspired apostle. It was something pleasing and profitable to see how Ciss sidled herself into the hearts at the Brook ; with what address she adapted herself to the sluggish cur rents and grave volume of its stream ; how persever ingly she occupied and amused herself in matters she had never attempted before. She was actually enamoured of homeliness and seclusion, and as radiant at the end of several quiet weeks as on the day of her arrival. The inhabitants of the Brook would not have been flesh and blood if they had not been flattered and stirred by the advent of this errant star in their orbit, and its continued brilliance in their course. Mildred ransacked her repositories in order to ini tiate Ciss in her old fancy-work, and was almost as much excited by Ciss's stitches in point and her rug fringe, as she had been by her own nigh thirty years"], [137, "Favour. 12^ before. Thomas hired a gardener, and deputed Ciss to supply him with orders and directions. He had out the old box of a phaeton on a week-day, and startled Craythorpe into a report that he was about to take to himself a young wife, by driving Ciss in her gay hat, and one of her various jackets, to the downs, which was the drive for strangers in his nonage. Lizzie encouraged Ciss to hang upon her skirts, and chat vivaciously, in her functions as deputy -housekeeper, and went the length of trusting her with the composition and baking of a tea-cake, which, be it confessed, Ciss found and left raw, after roasting its crust to a cinder ; nevertheless, every one ate of it, and insisted it was very good \u2014 considering. The very servant-girls, ploughmen, and herds, smirked and sniggled to Miss Ciss, who was always turning up amongst them, asking their assistance, questioning them about their employments and recreations, and wishing them good speed. The maid-servants affirmed she was something like a pretty, lively, young lady ; and it was something like a house to live in when Miss Ciss was despatching them at all hours to Craythorpe for odds and ends of ribbon and lace, feathers and flowers, gum and paint, paper and books, for undoubtedly Ciss was very often busy on light stitching and study on her own behalf. She was perpetually changing the shape of those flimsy jackets, and sleeves, and collars. She was incessantly constructing new and enchanting puffs and ruffs, knots and rosettes. Besides all this, she executed pin-cushions for every member of the family,"], [138, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 124 from Thomas (Ciss maintained her point this time, and insisted she had known men who hoarded pins) down to the poultry-girl who chased the young chickens from the wheat, \u2014 making them of every material from cut velvet, the feuille morte ofthe ancients, down to merino. She dotted the house over with urn-mats, anti-macassars, and Afghan blankets, as if the severe old Brook had been smitten by a fancy bazaar. Thomas displaced the encumbrances softly, and even lifted some of them between his finger and thumb, and looking at them, with his grim face inclined sideways, inquired, ' What pretty things are these, Ciss ? I 'm afraid they 're use less though, \u2014 they're like yourself.' What trumpery it was ! and yet there was a place found for it at the rugged old Brook, as there was a place in Nature's chorus for the little robin that invaded the Brook's leaf-strewn garden, and lilted its autumn song so shrilly. The robin and Ciss bore a family likeness to each other; Ciss in her finery recalled the little bird jerking and pluming itself in its pretty feathers, as well as the downy buds bursting on a summer day. Lizzie had often wondered what Dr. Matthew would think of Ciss Berry, and the first time he met her at the Brook he was, by force of contrast, more cynical than ever, scoffing at Ciss's frail wares, and distinctly in ferring that she could do nothing more worthy of her womanhood. But Ciss never minded him, any more than the little birds mind the fuming, stamping ox. ' Sweetly sang the birds aboon, Care never minding,'"], [139, "Favour. 125 Ciss proceeded with her airy trifles, rather innocently flaunting them in his bronzed face than making any effort to conceal them, and laughing without the slightest dread or shame. But though Dr. Matthew was very scornful, he could not refrain from bestowing on Ciss the same gift which the savage Dean pre sented to his beautiful Miss Kelly \u2014 Spanish liquorice for her cold. Ciss stood in as great need of it as an other ; she was not one of those well-balanced persons who can always keep themselves well. She was as hoarse as a raven the one day, had a stiff neck the next, and a sprained foot the third ; and remained energetic and gay throughout a catalogue of calami ties. It would have done any doctor, who waged war with nerves, megrim, and loud lamentations, abundance of good only to behold her. Ciss took the liquorice as if its transfer was no surprise to her. I believe, in her own lavish fashion, she afterwards endowed Dr. Matthew with her despised strap, and he laughed and stretched it in his large hands, and snapped it in two, but he carried off the fragments. ' What a Hotspur of a fellow Cousin Matthew is ! ' observed Ciss in retirement. ' Is he an admirer of yours, Cousin Lizzie?' Lizzie denied the charge strenuously, and wondered that Ciss could take such an absurd notion into her head. ' Very well, then, I may set my cap at him myself,' proposed Ciss jauntily. ' I rather like to play gentle Zephyr to rude Boreas ; besides, you know, he is fair"], [140, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 126 game, a kind of connexion of mine.' Ciss found every body connected with her ; if they had not mutual blood relations, they had mutual friends and acquaintances. It is in my mind if she had encountered the Imaum of Muscat, she would have established a relation with him through some wandering Arab. That was one reason why Ciss was never introduced to man, woman, or child, without, like Sidney Smith, being in confidential communication with them within half an hour, on the basis of that minute network of family ties. But Ciss need not have made a pretence of availing herself of a connexion ; there are some people who begin as babies to set caps, and go on setting them in every direction with the utmost success, until they are incapable of either setting or pulling caps any longer. Ciss was one of them. ' Let me see if young ladies can perform a reasonable service beyond being flattered and fooled by wretched old women, to whom they dole half pounds of rice and half-a-dozen yards of calico, and who grin maliciously at \" the pretty, good ladies \" the moment their backs are turned,' cried Dr. Matthew in his domineering way, and taking in Lizzie in his sweeping censure as a cloak to his purpose of confounding Ciss. He had come in with a tale of a poor child that had fallen over a quarry, and sustained sundry grievous braises and fractures, while its mother was working in a potato-field five miles off, and nobody left at home but another incompetent scared little child to execute his orders, and watch by his patient till the mother's return. The bullying doctor was foiled ;"], [141, "Favour. 127 up jumped Ciss, dragging Lizzie along with her ; off she started at a minute's notice ; nothing stayed her, nothing overcame her. She smiled upon the child whose bandages and mingled patience and restlessness caused Lizzie's heart to flutter, her hand to shake, and her eyes to grow dangerously dim ; she made herself mistress of the barren territory and the blundering little sister. Ciss did nothing wonderful, but the sufferer be came hopeful ; the attendant ready, under her familiar, free, blue eyes. The mother would have been sour as a crab at any other mortal who had interfered with her child, without producing a right in the shape of stores of medicine and meats ; but Ciss had not taken time to collect these, and dared not apply them without con sulting Dr. Matthew's will and pleasure ; still the woman accepted the foreign volunteer, and accepted her solely from her fluent accents, her open looks, her light, quick tread and touch. Ciss was heartily welcome, where Lizzie was never received without distrust. Ciss might go every day, with or without drugs and dainties, and be entertained with increasing regard both by mother and baby ; while Lizzie, however benevolently laden, was barely tolerated. It is some excuse for this gross partiality, that Ciss had within herself the unshaped materials for a glorious nurse ; while Lizzie, with her queries, her doubts, and terrors, would never be fit for a nurse to a less determinedly sanguine and constitution ally contented patient than Ciss herself. After that task, Dr. Matthew and Ciss were on what might be called friendly terms ; but he always treated"], [142, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 128 her as a child, and Ciss lifted the cue which he dropped to her without objection ; she interrupted him, chal lenged him, startled him, wildly and wilfully, according to her humour. Lizzie looked on as at an idle farce, of which the performers would weary in a day. Dr. Matthew was not the first growling philosopher who had unbent and played his play ; but Lizzie Knight had never witnessed the game, or dreamed of the conclusion. Lizzie sank back in her chair, thankful for the twilight which hid her consternation, when Ciss came to her, one afternoon, and, without any very unbecoming confusion or rigid assertion of calmness, with nothing but girlish confidence, and most light-hearted assurance, announced to her that Dr. Matthew wished her (Ciss) to marry him ; ' and I suppose I must, Lizzie, for you know I must marry somebody or other one day ! ' Ciss was about to commit wedlock with a man, in her rage for conferring favours ; and to hear Dr. Matthew talking of his proposal, he was, in his surliness, little short of her in his submission to an obligation. 'A doctor, like a minister, could not do without a wife, ergo a wife was an incumbent imposition ; and, for Miss Ciss, she rather needed to be looked after.' Then Ciss had her gibe about bolting heads and broken bridles, and he had his retort, foolish, if it were not somewhat brutal, of the whip-hand. It was all a distress to Lizzie, and yet Thomas and Mildred were not only satisfied, but elated, and audibly congratulated each other on the happy, good-natured child Ciss being arrested in her farther flight, and"], [143, "Favour. 129 established near them. Nobody was shocked ; nobody was hostile; Dr. Matthew's father and mother yielded to the contingency as affably as if Ciss had been Thomas Knight's daughter or sister instead of his young cousin, as if her rejection and disparagement would imply the cutting off Dr. Matthew with the unimproved acres ol the Brook without a shilling of ready money to expend upon them. Dr. Matthew's father and mother advanced the length of extending the olive-branch over Ciss's unreflecting head, and fitting out an embassy of con ciliation and reconciliation to their offended cousins, whose sore wrath had long frozen into a stony feud. Thomas and Mildred Knight, stubborn as the cruelly exasperated righteous often are, narrowing and shrink ing fast into a few hard, corroded lines, rose up and stretched their bonds for Ciss's young sake, and went forth slowly and stiffly to meet their commonplace, calculating kindred, to whom the past, with its fiery brand on the one house, had been to the other as a tale that was told. ' They might have spared our honour, Mildred ; they might have joined with us to conceal a poor sinner's defalcation,' exclaimed Thomas, in his old, high un wavering key ; but his eye fell on Ciss's bravery, and flickered as eyes will blench before the toys of a child. ' Well, we will not poison her pleasant cup, poor Ciss ; we will even let bygones be bygones for her sake and Matthew's ; these people may come and go as they like to the Brook for me.' In reality Ciss picked up the fallen lines, unravelled"], [144, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 130 the warped skein, wove anew the old, spoilt pattern, and all the time she had no consciousness of her merits, no conviction of her mission ; she was only a pleasant child, desiring to captivate Dr. Matthew's worldly father and mother, and that not so much for love of him as from a genius for captivation. Dr. Matthew and Ciss, with their respective impulsive, unnoticing tempers, remarked Lizzie's unpropitiatory gravity and chillness, in the first renewal of tokens of amity between the two families, and settled that she, harmless as she was, would never be a peace-maker, though the entire world were by the ears. Lizzie, pooh ! a passion-struck, incapable nonentity. Yet Lizzie was the noble ally who marched into the enemy's camp to support the self-interested bearers of the flag of truce. She was wounded, neglected, ridiculed ; she was one of those of whom the world is not worthy. Dr. Matthew and Ciss's love-affair did not always flow smoothly : as Ciss had apprised Lizzie of her intended union, it was her turn next to inform her with much the same brilliant, healthy blushes, and per plexing, inseparable mixture of fun and seeling, and not more than a dash of displeasure and alarm, that Dr. Matthew teased her, found fault with her for being agreeable to more amiable men ; she did not think she could permit it to go on ; she could not tell what would be the end of it. Lizzie looked at Ciss with her own troubled eyes, rCTind which the circles had grown to an olive darkness on her wan, fair cheeks.

'I thought some of you might have sought better company,' retorted Dr. Matthew sullenly, advancing, retreating, swerving to right and to left with his fiery horse. Lizzie supposed she was standing there at the risk of her life, but she gave a little laugh. ' I wonder you can be so exacting, Matthew ; the dews fall on many flowers, the moon shines for the whole world.' Dr. Matthew's eyes gave a flash at the words, though he was no more given to the appreciation of poetic similes than Lizzie was to the use of them ; but there are circumstances in a vehement man's life when he takes kindly to figures. Dr. Matthew suddenly pulled up his unruly horse, and leapt off. ' She will go more quietly when I 'm not on her back,' he explained; 'she's not accustomed to walk with my weight; she knows that there's a pair of us bent on our goal,' and Dr. Matthew turned and walked with Lizzie. He did not make another allusion to Ciss, neither did Lizzie ; but he was unusually considerate and kind to his cousin. He even said, ' You're tired, Lizzie,' and offered her his arm, assuring her that his horse would preserve a polite distance ; and really, to see how the high-stepping horse was upon good behaviour, and"], [147, "Favour. 133 walked at a foot's pace behind her master, without taking any greater liberty than an occasional whinnying over the arm round which her rein was flung, was en couraging. Lizzie walked in a dream, much as she had sat with Ciss on the first day of her arrival at the Brook. When they approached the house, Ciss issued from the avenue. She did not display the least tremor ; it was an odd relief to see her advancing so cordially and merrily. She said directly \u2014 'I've been looking out for you; you've been long of coming,' and went round to Dr. Matthew's disengaged side, and took hold of his arm. He was too much encumbered to go on as Ciss in tended ; but it was Lizzie's hand he dropped, not Ciss's, though he amended his fault the following moment by proposing to mount Ciss on ' Highflyer,' to get her out of his road. But he hastily refused to make the dry joke a practical one, when Ciss begged him to put his threat into execution. ' She's not used to women, \u2014 like her master ; I would not trust you upon her, unless she was regularly broken for months. Ciss, Ciss, don't go so near her ; don't you hear? keep away from her hoofs?' and Dr. Matthew, who rode on his own account, as the son of Nimsh' drove, ' furiously,' was so little inclined to be rash another's person, and that other Ciss, that he whirleu his steed round into the middle of the road, with an"], [148, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 134 anxious droop of the mouth, and start of moisture to the brow. Dr. Matthew and Ciss married as they proposed, and if society had nothing else to say in favour of the match, it allowed that it was at least a blessing that Dr. Matthew had found a wife who did not nourish a scruple of fear of him. Dr. Matthew and Ciss thenceforward ruled society on two directly opposite principles. Dr. Matthew governed it with a rod of iron, and held it at bay ; Ciss man\u0153uvred it with a shepherd's crook wreathed with flowers, and brought its members trooping gladly, like flocks of sheep, to her feet. Ciss was the most popular woman within three counties, and her husband propor tionally envied. What, in spite of her scrapes 1 \u2014 even in spite of her scrapes. A bold, blithe child like Ciss, who puts her hand into every dish, is scorched and scalded, not by scores, but by hundreds of times. You have seen the mischief which a lively child generally contrives to create in a house ? Just such was Ciss's mischief in the world ; but who bears malice against the child ? who would give up the child, though it were to pull down the house about our heads ? who can even forget what light, and zest, and spirit, and fun, and fondness the child brings with it into the house ? So the inhabitants of Craythorpe, Dr. Matthew's father and mother, the family at the Brook, truly and fully forgave Ciss hei numerous involuntary offences. They would have been so dull and cheerless without her ; they would liave wanted so much of the wine and scent of their"], [149, "Favour. 135 lives. Husband and wife had their discords ; Ciss, with her accessibility, her obliging humours, her absence of perception of natures less hardy and sunny than her own, tried her husband as we all try each other. Dr. Matthew would cut the Gordian knot with imperial deci sion and violence, and though Ciss was not capable of conceiving a shade of apprehension where he was con cerned, she was susceptible of being hurt by her husband's despotism. Then Lizzie Knight, a stiff, still maiden lady, whom everybody voted a bore, was the mediator between them, as she had been in the days of their courtship, and so successfully that they forgot her very existence in the perfect fulfilment of her office ; they forgot the office itself, and the need of it, and would have been extremely indignant \u2014 Dr. Matthew like a bear, Ciss like a shrieking sparrow \u2014 if any invidious individual had ventured to hint that they were not the happiest couple in the world. I should expect that Dr. Matthew at the close of his life, looking back on the long period that Ciss had brightened its atmosphere and dispelled its malaria, feeling how her presence had planted and nourished slips of faith and hope, would leave it as his dying testimony, 'We have been very happy together, Ciss ; we have been the better of each other, my darling ;' and Ciss would assent eagerly through her sobs, and Lizzie Knight, catching the words, would clasp her hands on them, in her solitary home, and call herself blest.

How woman can ever feel ashamed of such good and glad crowns; how man can ever cry shame upon her for wearing her natural adornment (as much her natu ral adornment as the hair of her head), and for wield ing her natural sceptre, of which men reap the full advantage, are among the disheartening anomalies which have continued to exist in the middle of free dom, intelligence, benevolence, and Christianity. Per haps it is because we have loved womanliness so well, that we fear even what seems to tarnish its meekness and modesty ; in which case let the doubt be amply forgiven, though surely it is an unworthy doubt, like that which prevents a Christian from inquiring into the proofs and reasons of the faith which is in him, or from summoning science to walk in its proper place, hand in hand with revelation. Womanliness, to be trae, gentle, loyal, and docile, must be stupid and silly ! A strange compliment to innocent, delicate womanliness. Indeed, there are no such sadly obstinate wights as narrow minded worthies ; no such vain though kindly feather heads as flourish over shallow and weak brains.

What a pleasant dream was that of the milk-maid over her basket of eggs ; how they were to be converted into chickens, fowls, geese, lambs, flocks of sheep, calves, stalled oxen, a farm waving with russet wheat, and bloom ing with blue potato -blossom ; the green gown which was to captivate ' Colin, my dear,' and ' Colin, my dear,' in person, crowning the pyramid !

Madge Haliburton sat dreaming, dreaming one sultry summer night, at the window of a house looking out on an old sea-washed cathedral. It was a little town, full of poor or pompous folk ; but the massive arches, the rarely-carved doorways and windows of the ruin, whose living glory was departed, brought art-students to the neighbourhood, and gave a slight art bent to the society of substantial or mean professional men and shop keepers. The cathedral gave a direction to Madge Haliburton's task and talents. She was a clever crea ture, Madge ; but, like those architects of the middle ages, who built because of Strasburgh and Milan, Madge probably painted because of the symmetry of tower and belfry, and the perfect colouring of the brown old stones, and bronze lichens which powdered them like gold dust. Madge was believed to have a craze about the cathedral ; she painted it constantly, from every point of view, with something like an agony of admiration, and something like an agony of abasement at her own inadequate at tempts to do it justice. She often told herself she was a vain fool to approach it with a pencil ; it was as far above her as the sky, and she ought to confine herself to cottages ; but, after all, it was an unfailing source of joy to her. I believe its very stones were dear to her,"], [163, "Ambition. 149 like the dust of Zion to the captives in Babylon ; above all, it served her as a master in apprenticeshiD. All of us had better begin, as we shall have to end by casting amateur achievements to the winds, and submitting to a long, irksome, toilsome, though gradually brightening apprenticeship. Madge had been painting during the day, hot as it had been, and was now, perforce, resting and thinking in the twilight ; and then, to reward Madge, there sud denly dawned upon her, and marched before her, one of those processions of the future, which beguile us from the present and lure us on to glory or to destruc tion. But first, before catching the bright film of Madge's dream, a word on the sober substance of Madge's life. Madge's home was a quiet one, to some too quiet ; but Madge liked it, loved it with a sacred intensity of fondness, somewhat as she did the old cathedral. Her father was a respectable old trades man, not rich, though with a strain of refinement in his disposition which many monied men Want. They used to call him, with justice, a gentlemanly old man. Madge's mother was more bustling and more ordinary ; still she was a kindly woman, loved and slaved for Madge and the little ones, and was only vexed that Madge's life was half-moping, half- laborious like her own. Mrs. Haliburton would have been quite con tented going on doing a drudge's work for Madge, if Madge would but have been what she could thoroughly understand; if Madge would have taken her pleasure and made a little show in the town, and only occasion-"], [164, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 150 ally helped her mother and the servant-girl with the cooking, and cleaning, and mending, and making of garments for the family. It was short-sighted of Mrs. Haliburton, but it was so far disinterested ; and perhaps there was blended with it a little vexed prescience. If Madge went on with her reading and drawing, though she made her living by them, would not such pursuits gradually separate her from her mother? Would not Madge, good and true as she might be, prove less her mother's companion and friend if she should be able to work a miracle, and grow into a cultivated genius ? Mrs. Haliburton was right ; Madge did drift away from her mother's side to occupy another position with regard to her; and it caused them both pain and trouble for many a day ere they fitted into their new places. Madge's brothers and sisters were all younger than she was, and, as it sometimes happens in large families, were more companions of each other than of Madge ; and yet there was no want of affection between them. So it happened that when Madge kept a vigil she kept it alone. And Madge knew very well that to be an artist of even moderate pretensions, she must eat her bread em phatically in the sweat of her brow, or else throw an additional load on her already burdened father. It was this reflection more than any other that occasion ally staggered her; but I do not find that it ever diverted the girl to any extent from her course, any more than the hoary, serene, unattainable perfection of"], [165, "Ambition. 151 the old cathedral ; and thus we come upon Madge rest ing from painting. Madge sat on an old window-seat in a kind of lumber room, where she was at liberty to draw and paint, and where she could command leisure ; and well it is for your isolated student if there is such a lumber-room in a family house. She was idly fingering some shells, and looking out on the cathedral, already looming a giant in the gloaming, and away on the yellow stretch of sands and the grey sea. The sea and the sands are not favourable to ambition, any more than fragrant hay fields and cattle-sheds. The Bucolics are apt to cripple a man and render him bovine ; the sea and the sands are too vast, they press upon one like a fate ; they sug gest, not a note of victory, but a moaning for the doomed and their destiny. But she was too young to study nature with a human instead of an artist's eye. To look at Madge herself, she was nothing remarkable : she was tall and fresh-coloured, a little old-looking for her years, and with something restless in her air, and searching in her eyes, which spoiled their beauty ; her hands, too, showed her a nervous girl, as they perpetually opened and closed on the round shell, with its flecks of rich, soft, shaded tints, like those painted on the skin of a wild beast. She was fancying, ' What if I ever gain expression and skill to paint the cathedral as truly as the sea, or the living creature within, from the essence of its own being, has painted this shell, and folk start and draw a long breath, and stand to gaze at the facsimile as they do at the"], [166, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 152 original, and feel that it too is a reality, has the impress of spirit ! I think I have something in common with the cathedral, or with the man who built it, although it is not very modest to say it even to myself; but I do feel one with it, as I do not feel with many speakers and their speeches. Little Davie suggested the other day, apropos of the engine roaring and tearing along on the other side of the garden- wall, \" I wonder if that big brute knows me;\" very egotistical of Davie, and I am sure it is very egotistical of me to suppose that I know the cathedral, and that it looks down on me like a grand old father. Some day if I try every shade and every hue, and paint and pant and pray, will it come nearer me, and shall I read all its proportions and dyes, and hold converse with the spirit which devised it, as a man with his fellow ? How calm, and full, and conscious ot wisdom and power I should be then, and how bountiful to humanity to multiply beauty, and bring it round our boards and beds ! Oh, dear, how crazed the town would think me, if it could hear me thinking ! The people call me cracked already, and they scorn my poor father and mother for tolerating my pride and vanity, and they say my pride will have a fall, and that it is madness to encourage a girl to be unlike her neighbours ; nothing good ever comes of it. Even Mr. Bernard, the artist, hinted to my father that it was folly and presumption in me to choose such a walk, though I had some taste and touch ; women were never anything better in his trade than weak bunglers. I would need to attain a certain degree of excellence, and constitute my scratches and"], [167, "A moition. 153 daubs marketable commodities to meet buyers; think how hard that would be ! only to reach the short length which thousands of wealthy women are born to. But it is not true,' \u2014 and Madge's face flushed a bright red, and her foot beat upon the floor, while she recalled the cruel, cowardly accusation, \u2014 'it is not true that I would waste my father's means, or that I desire to be (V fine lady, in place of a nursery-governess or a dress. maker, or a milliner. I will never take a farthing that I have not earned to aid my own projects. I dare not, for how can I tell that they will succeed, or that I shall live to accomplish them; but if they did succeed, if they prospered \u2014 ' Madge leant forward to the open window in the direc tion of the purpling west, and the violet sea, and the pinnacles of the old cathedral ; and her lips parted with the triumph and gladness of the realization. The vision ran on, and was not unworthy of the scene.

' Madge, Madge, are you a wise woman, or are you a fool ? Thousands mock and deride you, and echo loudly the old insolent, sensual baron's cry, 'Go, spin, you jade! go, spin.' Only a few, a very few valiant and charitable brothers and sisters whisper gently, 'wait and see if she can climb the steep mountain; we will crown her on the summit' It is winter in place of summer, with fogs shrouding the sea, and snow-flakes picking out, with a skeleton effect, the old cathedral. Madge is in the dear old house, but she is no longer in the lumber-room, which never looked dreary in these cloudless summer mornings and evenings. She is in a modern painting-room, with all the accessories and indulgences of modern invention ; palette and easel, lay-figure, models and casts disposed around her. She is not a girl now; she is a woman past her prime. Her aii has lost its restlessness, but it"], [169, "Ambition. 155 is languid with the reflection of weariness : her eyes are no longer searching, but they are hollow in her face. It is somewhere about Christmas time, and she owns that it ought to be holiday with her, and so does not work, but comes and sits and medi tates in the dusk, before her studio fire, as she pon dered in the summer sunset over the sea by the western window. There is a shadow upon Madge to-night ; a black, thick shadow, which strongly sympathetic natures must face and overcome. She rather crouches and cowers over her fire, and listens to the voices in the next room. The old people are there, and some of their family, and she has a sense to-night that her presence may be an intrusion among them. Respected and beloved, she is still a check on their frank, ordinary life. It is a sad truth, that she is more isolated as a woman than as a girl. Had her family been some steps higher on the social ladder ; had she not had to toil so heavily and unremittingly, she might have carried them in a greater degree with her. As it is, she may be their divinity, but she is not their familiar friend. But Madge has done something that should console her. Her cathedral is not only stamped upon her soul, but she has given forth reflections of it, and of other cathedrals, and of cathedrals of the rocks and the woods, which she has lived to recognise. Not kindred eyes alone, common eyes have read them, and responded with a dumb joy to the reading. Madge has conquered. They no longer say, in her native town, that she is silly"], [170, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 156 and audacious, and the next thing to an adventuress ; for in Madge's town unacknowledged intellect is barely respectable. They no longer sneer at the patent defects which Mr. Bernard has kindly and magnanimously pointed out to them in her works, and pity the poor thing for infatuatedly spending her strength for nought, and giving her money for that which is not bread ; and next pity the idiotic father and mother for lending her their countenance in her enthusiasm, and for not positively forbidding the nuisance. Ah ! poor Mrs. Haliburton had done her best with the conceited, headstrong girl ; and it was well known that she was mortified and affronted by Madge's preten sions to studiousness and affectation of genius. She had been well aware, that making puddings and stitching shirts would have better become her daughter. For Mr. Haliburton, it was well known that he was always a poor scheming creature himself, so that the girl had, doubtless, her absurdity by descent. That was over. The inhabitants no longer laughed and shook their heads, as Madge passed them on the street with her portfolio. They bowed to her, and called for her ; the magnates did, and asked her co-operation in their socie ties, and listened to her advice when she bestowed it along with her contributions. She had done something more at home : the old tradesman's household was no longer hampered and harassed ; the wheels of life ran easily there now; the spirits that had been subdued and distracted, at length tasted self-respect, cheerfulness. The younger members of the family were going out into"], [171, "Ambition 157 the world with less clouded anticipations and sunnier prospects. And Madge had done something too for her own spiritual development ; had won some commission tvorth chronicling. One or two knights-errant, waging war with ignorance, ugliness, sloth, and sin, had clasped hands with her in her career, wanned her poor, stiff fingers with their encouragement and approval, lifted up her struggling spirit to something of a level with their own freedom, and given her a draught or two of the pure air, and a glimpse or two of the heaven that would be. But Madge sees nothing of this to-night ; her mantle of darkness is upon her. Her pictures \u2014 they are miser able caricatures, faded shadows decrying, degrading the glorious works of God, the majestic efforts of masters and true craftsmen. She sees every false line and weak point in them to-night, until she puts her hands before her eyes to shut out the copies on the walls ; copies which she had painted with childlike hope, love, and thankfulness. She had deceived others, or else their money was rife ; and some who gave praise and not money had been weakly good-natured, or basely hypo critical, and had only feigned to be deceived. And for this gross failure she has pawned youth, leisure, equal companionship, kindly ties. She remembers when she had gone out almost at day-break, morning after morn ing, walked miles and miles, through dust or mire, to this waterfall or that bridge, painted and painted the live-long day, ate a morsel of bread from her pocket, and lagged home at night-fall faint and weary. She"], [172, "158 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. remembers when she had missed both dinner and supper to run at odd moments to the cathedral ; when she had missed her father's prayers, to take it under the light of the first star ; when she had to pay a special fee to the old man at the gate, be stared at as uncanny, and grumbled over as unreasonable. She had narrowly escaped being crippled with rheumatism ; she had been once or twice on the verge of a nervous fever ; and what were her wages ? The old folk were more comfortable, \u2014 she confessed that; but would she not have been more of a comfort to them, more of a daily and nightly right-hand woman, a house-daughter in short, such as fathers and mothers love best and prefer first, \u2014 had she not endowed them as a benefactress, but relieved them as a child ? Had she simply been interested in their concerns and occupied at their instigation ? She fancied Janet and Melville might be careless of their every wish. She knew she could have been devoted to them, but she had no liberty left her. Her father grudged to see her hem his pocket-handker chiefs ; her mother refused to allow her to make her markets. ' We won't take up your valuable time, Madge. No, no, my dear; go to your canvas, or else enjoy yourself in your own way.' That was not the worst of it. Continual hurry of mind is not conducive to tranquillity of temper. Madge writhed under the fear that she was often impatient and undutiful in word, though never in deed. She was all for obscurity and mediocrity to-night Simple suffering"], [173, "Ambition. 159 was the best discipline to a woman ; acting as she had done was a forward, fatal error. For Madge's brothers and sisters, alas, alas ! some were no longer here for whom Madge had striven and conquered. She had her guerdon, but she could only place it on their silent graves. And were not they who were gone, the very ones for whom she could have worked most wonders, who would have rejoiced most in her attainments, who could have profited most by her gain? The others seemed to be independent of her, \u2014 might be rendered worse instead of better, by a staff to lean upon, a shelter to fall back into. There was Melville, so blooming and thoughtless, engaged to be married, too, though she had never borne a cross, or taken to herself a care. How would she stand alone, or combat with difficulties in the battle of life ? Love would teach her, and love was a tenderer teacher than the grim old cathedral ; love would find her and leave her fearless, fond, dependent, and trustful. Melville was not alone this cold December night ; Melville would not be alone under the laurel crown on her grey hairs ; Melville would not lie alone on her dying bed. There was a tap at the door of Madge's room, fol lowed by a rustling, and whispering, and joyful giggling of young and old voices. It grated on Madge's ears. 'Come in,' she said, austerely, and looked round with asperity. But the indignation vanished from Madge's brow in a"], [174, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 160 moment, when there entered her old father with his hand on his stick, her mother in the very lace cap under whose peaked caul Madge used to imagine there was safety and assurance for ever, her sisters, her brother Hugh and his wife, and one or two of their little, stumping, brawling children, in the par ticular escort and patronage of her youngest brother Davie. 'We thought you were too long alone, child, and none of these refractory young people would take upon them to interrupt you and fetch you, so we have come in a body, for we cannot do without you, Madge,' and then there burst in a chorus. ' To choose the colours of the wools, Madge.' ' To help to entertain us, who are strangers.' ' To cut out figures for us, Aunt Madge, and make trumpets and boats.' ' To awe impertinent people, Madge.' Madge rose, yawning and laughing, as if she had been caught in a stupid, luxurious nap, but with a pang ol remorse and repentance at her tender heart. In the parlour, the servant was putting down her letters, and waiting to speak to her. ' The cripple, Andrew, Miss Madge, come to let you see how he is getting on with his schooling, and he's as proud as a peacock before he begins ; and the old woman, Macfarlane, come to tell of her daughter's re covery in the hospital, and she's as happy as a queen this night'"], [175, "Ambition. 161 Madge, Madge, read your letters, for I predict they contain commissions and criticisms which make you blush, for you are as bashful, Madge, as Lord Nelson, about whom Davie mutters in his sleep.

However, there is this curious contradiction, that there is nothing more necessary than to urge young girls to cultivate purely pleasant habits, purely pleasant tastes which shall not pall, which they may reasonably hope will increase and brighten with years, and be made perfect in a better and an enduring world. There is nothing more puzzling, and yet more patent in the present day, than the neglect and destruction, as far as it is possible, of a multitude of delicate instincts which, quite as much as great faculties, fill us with pleasure. The eye is un trained, or only artificially trained ; the natural ear is neglected in the midst of its elaborate tutoring, or only accustomed to discord ; the quick feelings are allowed to ran riot, or condemned to be blunted ; the bright humour to sleep ; the buoyant elasticity to sink flat and dead. How full our life is ; how much we might enjoy it, and thank God for it ! But we overlook our trea sures, and forsake them for the cold glitter of fairy gold, or the dead heaviness of substantial but unlacked, un suitable bullion, till we fina our error too late. And"], [177, "Pleasure. \\ 63 well it is if it only end in a long, wistful sigh of regret ; if, in spite of all our follies and imputations, we have still built on the rock of our Master and our duty. One of the very first lessons to be learned is, that true pleasure is a simple, lowly, homely, hearty thing, open, in a great degree, to most of us. Alas, alas ! that ever there should be such hard circumstances as to crash it out of existence. But to many, to multitudes, to the mass of those addressed, pleasure is an easy thing ; is nigh you, is ready to burst out into blossom over your head, and under your feet. Only condescend to lift up your eyes and look for it, and stoop and pluck it ; for, like everything else worth having, it is coy, and will not force itself on your reluctant or careless grasp. It is scarcely necessary to say to a good girl that true pleasure cannot consist in what belongs to mere rivalry and gratified vanity. Such pleasure is, to treat it most gently, very empty and unsatisfactory ; and unless it is mixed with some genuine emotion, some honest asser tion of honest claims, honest satisfaction in honest gifts, honest gratification in the honest pride of friends, it is about as noisy, hollow, and short-lived as that crackling of thorns beneath the pot, which the wise man banned. But it is incumbent to publish that pleasure, like duty, does not consist in anything like intellect and great mental attainment. To some, of course, it lies there, as even to the soldier it may lurk in the smoke of artillery, and the flash of steel ; and to another soldier of the same master, it may actually abide in the dark and noisome den in which he blesses God that he hails"], [178, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 164 the dawn of a better day. But to all it is plainly in what affords them innocent gratification. It is a giant with a hundred hands ; a rainbow with a thousand dyes. It changes, Proteus-fashion; it varies with a million temperaments. It may be something very different to you from what it is to me. But it perfectly agrees in this respect, \u2014 it is a harmless, nay, a softening, sweeten ing enjoyment, though we may not and need not go far out of our way to seek it, and must not sacrifice for it our cross of duty. We are bound to cherish it as one of the instalments of the future, one of the alleviations of the present, a bright drop of dew, a brave beam of sunshine sent to refresh and gladden us by our gracious Father. And the more childlike our hearts are, the more submissive and loving, the more readily we admit, the more freely we entertain the heavenly visitant. We cannot be true Protestants, we must be clinging very pertinaciously to the doctrines and practices of will worship, asceticism, supererogatory mortification, if we do not recognise the obligation and privilege of drawing forth all the pleasures within our nature and locality, and carrying them heavenwards. But if pleasures are countless as the leaves on the tree, and, like the leaves, not two alike, they fall also pretty generally into classes, and offer themselves in their divisions to particular orders of the community. To young girls, allowing for many exceptions, there exists a peculiar range of delights, capable of expanding and maturing with the growth of the woman, until, m full dropping ripeness, balmy and mellow they salute"], [179, "Pleasure. 165 the last, lingering, earthly sensations of widowed wives, aged mothers, frail spinsters hovering on the border land. This range belongs largely to primitive nature, to flower-gardens, kitchen-gardens, fields, woods, moors, mountains ; to animals, wild and domestic, useful and ornamental, cows and poultry, birds and bees, dogs and cats. That a love for nature is latent in the great body of men and women, is clear from its appearance under the most unfavourable circumstances, and after the longest intervals. The successful merchant withdraws to his villa, and dedicates his hard-won leisure to mangel wurzel and pine-apples, while his wife expatiates and luxuriates among her Alderneys and Cochin-Chinas. Of the retired tradesmen and their partners, whose ease and cash do not drag upon them, ninety-nine out of the hundred are amateur farmers or gardeners, or holders of some description of live stock. That so many only take to the teeming world \u2014 animate and inanimate around them \u2014 late in life, demonstrates that the original bent was choked and overlaid, and wanted excavation. Those who soonest disentangle it into breezy air and hardy life, develop also the most wholesome bodies and souls, the sweetest and sunniest tempers. Questionless, there are instances of crabbed gardeners and gruff farmers, but what would those rugged specimens of Vumanity have been without the lilies and the wheat? And are not their roughnesses but outer excrescences ?

It is not only that heedless youth, in its own head-strong, self-engrossed fashion, rushes along and misses the very sedative of which it stands in need ; but the habits of our present genera tion, the very accomplishments, the excessive pushing and straining after social importance, are all against simple, natural tastes. You will find the mother watch ing the young lambs coming into the fold with the careful ewes, while the daughter is off in a fit of the gapes ; the aunt, contrasting the crimson-tipped oak leaves with the blue-green of the juniper, and the olive green of the wild rasp, while the niece is in fretful horror lest the sprays from the bushes tear her cum brous crinoline. You will even discover the tottering old grandmother pulling up the gay celandine, or the feathery meadow-sweet from the waterside ; while the granddaughter has borrowed her brother's rod, and is fishing the pool, for 'a lark,' as she says, in her bro ther's slang, but, in reality, to attract the attention of all the half- scornful, half-scared fishers up and down the stream. It is not that the present race of young people are more frivolous than the last, but they are more removed from unconscious, close, constant study of nature.

This is the case just as much reading is apt to end in little thinking, as popular lectures have often resulted in popular ignorance, self-satisfied, defiant, all but incurable ignorance, for the reason that it wore a shallow disguise of knowledge. All the appliances of modem training include a danger of leaving our girls vain, arrogant, pretentious, and insincere. They have studied botany, but they don't care for their specimens one-hundredth part that their mother cared for her hydrangea in the green-and white striped stoneware pot, which was such a cold, hard substitute for the soft-stained, oozy brick. They don't mind their ferns and mosses as she prized the upper slice of carrot, which she cut and floated on a wine glass full of water, and saw rear its shafts of feathers when the snow was lying thick in the valley ; or the cress-seed which she sowed on the moistened flannel over the cup, to astound and delight poor sick little Hughie. Ah ! you girls want the easy admiration, the frank, loving wiles of your mothers ! Our great-grandmothers, in the dearth of many other resources, thought much more of the fragrance of the mint and thyme in their herb-gardens, the sweetness of the fruit of their cherry-trees, the gaiety of their larks' songs, the stature of their calves, the fatness of their chickens, the familiarity of their pet-lambs, even the smartness of their parrots, and tame starlings and spar-"], [182, "168 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. rows, than many of their descendants dream of doing ol any plant or animal at home or abroad. The sciences are noble in their own way ; open-air sketching is a valuable power ; pic-nics are occasionally pleasant, social reunions, but Charlotte Bronte has told how little the agreeableness of a pic-nic has to do with burying one's face and heart in green leaves. We have all known pic-nic visits to rains which were never looked at, to views which were never seen, to waterfalls which were missed. Pic-nics, in the old days, were named whims or follies : my lady's whim, or my lady's folly, to eat a syllabub or a bun under a tree, or on clover. As far as regards learning to know God's world, pic-nics (unless strictly family gatherings) will be whims and follies to the young always. No ; take nature quietly ; make a secret contract with her, or, at most, a threefold friendship between you two and a home-brother or sister. Don't mix her up too much with books. Look at her in her own simple, lovely light. Learn the shades and shapes of the trees from the belt in your own shrubbery ; grow intimate with the moon, looking at her silver bow or her mellow autumn radiance, from your own parlour or drawing room window, with your old father taking his nap at your elbow, and waking up to his game at whist or back gammon after the candles are lit; or with your baby nephew stretching out his arms to that shield in the sky, and drumming with his feet against your knees from his station in your lap.

All that is untrue is bad, but, at least, we may receive the assumption of superior knowledge as the evidence of a more ample and genial standard of worth and beauty. One word, in addition, to those young persons who may be disheartened by having grown up with only a vague general sense of enjoyment in the world of nature; a pleasant notion of blue skies and green fields, and pretty weeds in the hedges, but no intimate acquaintance or close communion with any of them. Do not be dis couraged. This is a taste which it is possible to begin to cultivate sedulously and successfully at any period of life, even to old age. The writer speaks from experi ence. Brought up in a treeless district of the country, the commonest distinctions between the crisp, shining leaves of the beech and the leaves of the elm, ' rough as a cow's tongue,' were long unknown to her by sight. She was as full of her lush growth of fancies and feelings as any one. She was as blind and deaf as most girls to everything but the dimmest perception of nature's holy influences. The opening of her mind to these influences was not the least of the debt which she owed to the dear, wise, patient friend who taught her a cottage child's acquirements leaf by leaf; who stretched her own knowledge to make her pupil distinguish the hues and lines on the bird's burnished wings and breast; who went on with her listening to the roll of the waves, periodically peeping into a hedge-sparrow's nest, lifting reverent eyes to the flaming comet, hearkening to the blackbird's melodious song over the primroses and"], [186, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 172 polyanthuses in the cold spring twilight, and the robin's cheerful note among the scarlet-streaked apples and dark-green mottled pears of the russet fall, \u2014 until some thing of the richness of earth's colours, and the deep but gentle symphony of her tones was forced upon the heedless, inattentive heart and brain. Nature is God's book, in which we are to read our Father as in his written word, and she who neglects and turns her back on the study, will be ill-furnished in some respects for that consummation to which we are all devoutly looking. A LEAF FROM A DIARY. I am in the country, and I must keep a diary at last ; not to count my mental or spiritual pulse, but to record, when the turkey-hens laid their first eggs ; when the sheep were clipped ; when this or that great misfortune hap pened, and the otter ate the fish.

I was buried alive in a large town, among a crowd of acquaintances, when I was young and silly, and went with the multitude, and continually took things to heart, and had my feelings wounded ; but now I'm going to do my duty, and keep old Charlie right and tight, and make a garden pay its own rent, after the example of the garden in the book that is in the windows of all the booksellers' shops, and on all the railway stalls; I'm going to get well acquainted with nature before I 'm too old to study her fresh face, and get acquainted, too, with humanity; \u2014 not fine-lady humanity, or fine-girl humanity, or fancy-cottage humanity, in particular, but humanity wholesale, great and small, odds and ends ; humanity among big matrons and little maids, and people who have dirty faces, and keep unvarnished pigs.

I told Charlie so, while I caught at my bonnet-strings. What a gush of clean, cold gale ! it gave me an ap petite for days ; and what a deal I had to effect. Wouldn't I have the making of my home ?

' Coats is coats,' was all that Martha would say. ' No, Martha, coats is not coats under clever hands, and no genius worth speaking of ever existed who could not make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.' Martha shook her head ; she made up her mind that Mr. Durham was a sensible, 'sponsible man, but Miss Durham was light in the head for her size and years. I was more successful with the weaver, to whom I walked across after breakfast.

I wonder why toothlessness and cantiness go so often together. Are our teeth our natural enemies, and do we rejoice when we have got well rid of them ? or are we of a saturnine turn, and grin to show the world how we despise our own empty jaws ?

Charlie is such an orderly old man, that he'll keep it sweet and whole some ; and we '11 have near us ' the breath of kine ' which Pallas loved, and which cured the poor consumptive girl sent to breathe it from the chambers of nobles. We'll have watch-dog, cocks and hens, ducks and geese, lambs, horses, cows, all our familiar friends. The pea cocks and whole flocks of doves will come and eat the crumbs off the window-sill, as they do on the door-steps at the Castle. Darby and Joan will court before our eyes. The farm-yard will be our stage, with the scenes ever shifting; the farm-yard will be our concert-room, our tea and scandal, our supper and rubber. We'll never weary. We might have been ' buried alive ' in winter, when our flowers were all brown and bare ; but with our look-out among our subjects of the brute crea tion \u2014 our faithful, fond, noble, beautiful subjects \u2014 I'll defy us to weary. The ancients were right with their gable-windows into their farm-yards. Every farm-house should have a gable window, and every gable window should look out on a pale, yellow straw-yard, well ten anted, lying at its feet. An old moorland farmer detected me trying to pull"], [194, "180 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. up a thistle to-day, and went home and sent his girl with the present of a pair of thistle gloves ; and I re turned the compliment with an offer to knit him a pair of muffatees for his winter wear. Winter ! what must I not do before winter ? I must not trust to Martha ; I must learn to powder butter, cure hams, hang beef, and dry herbs out of my neighbours' gardens. The farmers' wives will laugh at me, but I will laugh back ; laugh and learn, as well as laugh and grow fat I flatter myself I can bake cakes already, as I think the farmer's rosy girl will bear me witness. She sang me such a bouncing, frisky song. I must have her to sing it to Charlie; he'll drum on the table with his knuckles, though he has not a notion of tune ; and that causes his regard for music \u2014 his blundering, ignorant, in stinctive regard \u2014 to be something touching to my mind. Am I too old to learn ? Never on this side of time. Thank God for that ! and Charlie and I did thank Him, looking at the moon like a sentimental old couple, and taking kindly to our new home."], [195, "VII. FRIENDSHIP. T N one of Miss Edgeworth's tales (I think The Absentee), there is an instance of a lady deciding her selection from her suitors, by the happy man's being able to prove that he possessed a faithful friend ; and the test was by no means without its merits. In a former paper I alluded to the fact that long before Miss Edgeworth's day, novels, biography, and essays laid much stress on evidences of friendship as indications of excellence. A heroine, like Harriet Byron, had a host of friends, and although she may tempt us to think of ' the hare and many friends,' and we may feel that she must have been in some sort a victim to her popularity, still it would do no harm to a heroine of the present day, to ask herself whether she could call forward a grandmamma to bless her ; an Uncle and Aunt Sedley to approve cordially of each stage of her career ; or even a set of cousins to sing her praises, after the faintest copy of the kindred of the incomparable Harriet ; and if not, what is the reason of the failure ? Granting, in deed, that the man or woman with a multitude of friends is a paragon, a ph\u0153nix, and has his or her own peculiar"], [196, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 182 danger from the chivalry and devotion of the individual's court, the man or woman without a friend is surely singularly unfortunate, or singularly reprehensible. It has been said that women are incapable of true friendship ; but, like many other glib speeches, this is an assertion not only without foundation, but made in the face of a mass of proof to the contrary. There may be difficulties in the way of a calm, clear, steady, unex acting friendship between man and woman, from the nature of the relation between them, though such friend ships have existed by thousands; but friendships be tween woman and woman, with which we deal here, have flourished by tens of thousands. Those who believe the contrary, are no better than Turks in their estimate of women. Possibly, one reason for the charge of women being incapable of friendship, is that their friendships are more domestic, hidden, and retiring than those of men. Of course, we do not speak of the bathos of school-girl ecstasies, but of the strong, satisfying regard between modest, earnest, often-tried women. Men go out into the world, and frequently form their friendships far beyond the family circle, and quite independent of the ties of blood. Of the best women, it may be said that their friendships are those of their own households ; with them, friendship but adds its evergreen crown to a blood relationship. Sisters and cousins \u2014 at the farthest, old school-fellows and neighbours \u2014 are generally the Davids and Jonathans, the Damons and Pythiases. But within these limits, examples of as enduring, long-"], [197, "Friendship. t g suffering, tender, noble friendship as ever knit together hearts, offer their manifold records. Madame de Sevigne\" and her daughter, Fanny Burney and her sister Susanna, Anne Grant of Laggan and her former youthful com panions, the Ewings and Harriet Reid, have left vivid, indelible traces on black and white of the great volume of their affection, and its faithful flow to death. Suffer young girls to make friends, and keep them as their best human stay. They need not fear that they will prove false, if their own love be without dissimula tion ; if they can cleave to their chosen companions in their adversity, and not love them one whit better be cause of their prosperity ; if they will choose them like that hackneyed wedding-gown of Mrs. Primrose, because of qualities which will wear well. They need not fear, if they themselves will try to be humble, reasonable, and forbearing, will resolve not to expect too much of their friends, will not be very angry with them because of errors, will not refuse to forgive them even when they commit faults, will always strive to bear in mind that ' the true friend is a brother,' and that the end of true friendship is to go on hand in hand, \u2014 each raising the other, each supporting the other, \u2014 ever upwards and onwards to the brightness and the peace of the better home in the many mansions of the Father's house. Honest friends, fond friends, constant friends they must be, my girls ; and after that proviso, care little whether they are fashionable friends, or distinguished in any way; even be willing to lend them a portion of your own superior wisdom and goodness, if they are"], [198, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 184 deficient, but well disposed and sincere in their esteem for you. Much progress in worth has been accom plished under the shelter and countenance of a friend ; here, ' freely you have received, freely give.' Be willing, in a secondary sense, to ' spend and be spent ' for your friends ; don't meanly grudge your love and pains, and cautiously weigh every grain of their return. Bestow thorough respect and sympathy ; lively, considerate, affectionate attention in health ; devoted care and self abnegation in sickness ; and without doubt or denial, be you wedded wife or solitary spinster, you will not fail in any circumstance to have and hold a tender and true friend. In the world there are two opposite corruptions of friendship, which are glaringly conspicuous. The one is the selection of high friends, who may pull us up, not in morals, but in power, or place, or fashion ; the other the taste for low company, where we may reign queen, be flattered instead of flattering, command rather than obey, indulge in all our ugly habits without censure. But human nature is the same ; these two abuses of friendship have their origin in the same source \u2014 vanity and pride ; and sometimes the poles meet curiously in one person. As human nature is the same, young girls will, at least, coast these shoals ; but I surely need not say to good girls, to avoid them as contamination ; don't let them, if they can help it, pollute the name of friend ship, if they would not lose their reverence for all that deserves reverence. My own opinion is, that a perfectly developed friend-"], [199, "Friendship. 185 ship can scarcely exist, or at least attain its full, free expression between those of widely different ages and stations, in spite of Wordsworth's lad, and his ' Matthew seventy-two.' It may be a very beautiful, beneficial, independent looking up and ben ding down, and in that light it ought to greet us continually ; but it is another connexion altogether from close friendship. When a young girl makes a friend of one above her station, she is hardly likely, altogether, to escape at once expe- riencing and inflicting pain, of which there is no chance among her equals. Her grand friend will unavoidably appear to overlook her sometimes, or will mortify her, or haply provoke her to envy by narrations of ' springs ' of adventure and interest, travel, pictures, music, books, cultivated society, which may be entirely beyond the so-called inferior's reach ; and, at the same time, the better born, or more richly endowed of the companions will feel hurt by her friend's coyness, stiffness, pride, when she herself only meant to be kind and social. Again, with the humble friend the girl in the middle class will run the very same risks, only changing the checkers ; and with the greatly increased peril of effect- ing something seriously detrimental to the permanent wellbeing of the other, because a simple, scantily-edu- cated girl is not by many degrees so well armed against an injury to her native dignity, self-respect, content ment, and her just balance of social advantages, as a well-taught, well-read, thoughtful girl in a station above her. Therefore good and judicious parents and guardians"], [200, "186 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. are chary of unsuitable intimacies for their children, unless under their own eye, and within certain bounds. Yet these intimacies are safe enough, even for the thoughtless and weak, if the heart be but wholesomely set on duty, and salted with grace. The writer, after having stated her general objection to these friendships, would like to record her conviction, that occasions are constantly occurring which defy our ordinary standards, when such half-proscribed bonds become strong and tight, and bind soul to soul in danger and trial with true love-knots, which death only will unloose, for a higher life to tie again firmly for ever. Without question, such accidental alliances (as these are apt to be considered) have often proved providential unions, calculated to confer mighty bless ings, and to survive the artificial obligations which forbade them. People say truly, it is a respectable thing to see an elderly couple surrounded by old-fashioned, well-kept furniture, according much better with the tear and wear of years than bran new upholstery of a higher cast, and more elegant material and manufacture. Our mother's grey hairs, and stout or lean persons, become their matronly though sober and rather quaint caps and shawls a thousand times better than they become an elaborate travestied edition of their youngest daughter's wreath of flowers and lace mantilla. In the same way, family friends are respectable, albeit sometimes trouble some institutions. A long-established house, with but recent guests, varying with each varying phase of the"], [201, "Friendship. 187 household, is a very sorry sight ' Your own friend, and your father's friend, forget not,' is a very gracious proverb ofthe wise man. Here our fine folk of the middle classes might profit ably borrow a lesson from the aristocracy whom they task themselves to imitate or mimic. Class fidelity, dis interested remembrance of ancient allies, persistent, persevering friendliness to fallen fellows, are the hon ourable characteristics where noblesse oblige. One grievous flaw in our magnates of the middle class is the horrible, heartless snobbishness with which they learn to cut their cronies, and cast whole circles from them, as a reptile casts its slough, or a mealy butterfly its chrysalis. We would have our girls put up with some inconvenience, be capable of some self-sacrifice, to maintain their own friends, and their fathers' friends, intact. Be sure the one true friend, the invaluable counsellor, the joyous confidante, the loving consoler, is mostly to be cut out of such tried and trusty stuff; not out of the slight, dignified acquaintance of yesterday, the facile superior, won by base flattery or material gain, to be the reluctant abettor of follies, the yawning spec tator of vanities, and the sneering satirist of absurdities. Your mother's contemporary may be narrow-minded and dogmatic, but she will tie on her bonnet with trembling fingers to ran to your sick-bed ; she will be all the same to you, or rather far more cordial and warmer hearted because your father has lost money in an unlucky speculation, or even been compelled, with bowed head and aching heart, to read his name in the"], [202, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 188 bankrupt list. She may find fault with you to your face ; but she will sternly rebut cruel, cowardly scandal, which attacks you like an assassin behind your back. Will you not bear, then, with a few truisms, and certain tiresome or aggravating peculiarities, were it only for the sake of her last kiss, and her ' God bless you ! you've been mindful of old friends, my dear ; I trust we'll meet again?' To have lightened a solitary hour, to have brightened a homely lot, to have cheered, for one afternoon, an invalid's depression, is worth a good deal of self-gratifi cation. Reflect that you yourselves, in the march of the future, with its innumerable chances and changes, may be destined to misfortune and adversity. Certainly, even though you continue in reasonable affluence of health and wealth, you will at some time or other grow prosaic if not peevish, old-fashioned if not obsolete. Then, even if from no more exalted motive than doing as you would be done by, show yourself generous to those who have lost your advantages, if they ever pos sessed them. Deserve friends among your equals, and cherish them for better, for worse, as God's gift, among the very first of gifts after His own presence; be conscientious to wards friends of another degree ; and be gentle, very gentle to your own friends, and your father's friends, of other day?."], [203, "Friendship. 189 DAME DOROTHY. ' These two girls are great friends ; ' so said Miss Lavinia Blount to her old assistant, confidante, and cousin, Miss Sophy Blount, in her northern boarding school near a great northern town. It was an old fashioned school, where there was more sewing than reading, and more manners than accomplishments. Miss Lavinia was an old-fashioned woman, sharp and rigid, worried into crossness by boarders' flights and parents' fumes, and stiff with the incessant maintenance of her own angular code of manners. But Miss Lavinia had a heart \u2014 an appendage the world is given to deny to her kind, notwithstanding they are not more covetous than the Jews, and Shylock established their community of interest with the public in that matter, even when he alternated, ' My ducats, and my daughter.' I wish all the fat, easy matrons, and all the bland, caressing matrons, had the brains which lay beneath Miss La vinia's turban, and the heart which beat behind Miss Lavinia's busk. 'Ain't they something like what you and I were, Sophy, long ago at Alnwick ? ' observed Miss Lavinia, in a softer tone. It was not easy to think of Miss Lavinia and Miss Sophy as thoughtless young things, but doubtless that event had been a historical fact at some period in the annals of the Percys and the north. An idea had struck Miss Lavinia, and when the girls curtsied to her, after they had closed their work-bags"], [204, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 190 for the night, and were preparing to retire to their rooms, she called Miss Anne Baldwin and Miss Dorothy Fenton to stand before her chair. The girls were not conscious of any fault, so they were placid and smiling. It is just possible \u2014 I believe it admits of a fraction of proof\u2014 that a school-mistress may be just and generous. Of course, she is generall) a mean tyrant, \u2014 keeping company with girls seems to have this effect ; but occasionally, you know, just for exception's sake, you may suppose her a worthy soul in buckram. ' The holidays occur next week, and I shall be very busy till then, and you, Dorothy, and you, Anne, return home for good immediately afterwards.' ' Yes, ma'am,' answered the girls at once, with broad smiles, associating the full swing of liberty and indul gence with home, as it would be a great pity they should fail to do ; but yet their dancing eyes were caught by Miss Lavinia's hawk's eye, and fixed a little wistfully on her furrowed forehead. Sundry festivals she had insti tuted, games she had fostered, sicknesses she had nursed, and, above all, Miss Lavinia's face, on a summer night, or a winter afternoon, when, all tasks done, she had merely sat and contemplated her humming, buzzing charge \u2014 these fascinated them and lingered in their imaginations. ' You have been great friends, you two ; see that you don't soon forget each other. My cousin Sophy and I were bed-fellows when we had curly heads of our own, and we have kept to each other through life, and stood"], [205, "Friendship. \\ a i by each other through good and bad. I believe we'll die under the same roof, and be buried in the same corner ofthe churchyard.' The girls looked doubtfully at each other, perhaps they gave a little involuntary rejecting wave of their cropped heads. Dying and burying made their flesh creep ; they seemed pale and cold as the moon to the young girls. The association between Miss Lavinia and Miss Sophy had not much to recommend it in their eyes ; they saw only its work-a-day character ; they did not understand its faithfulness. As for them, they would not be like Miss Lavinia and Miss Sophy, though these two women were good, kind mistresses, and they had a respect and a liking for them ; they would be something entirely different. However, they had no difficulty in promising warmly to Miss Lavinia that they would be true as steel to each other. Miss Lavinia dismissed Anne Baldwin, and retained Dorothy Fenton. ' Dorothy,' she said,- looking into a little face whose chief charm was its demureness, 'you know you are younger than Anne ; your father, though a respectable man, is not of so much consequence in the country as Squire Baldwin. You found Anne the head girl, oldest, cleverest (and cleverness goes some way in a school), liveliest, grandest. Anne had plenty of friends; but she selected you, a quiet little thing, from the momen* that she set eyes upon you. If you had not been marked out by Anne's choice, I am afraid you would have been rather lost sight of among your companions, and Miss Sophy and I could not have helped it much,"], [206, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 192 though we had tried ever so hard. Anne brought yoo out, she cured your home-sickness, she encouraged your shamefacedness, she made you contented and happy. But, Dorothy, though Anne did you great good at an important stage of your life, this has happened when you were two young girls, and you will live to hear and read a great deal in disparagement and scorn of girlish likings ; still I think you will be base if you forget it' ' But I will not forget it, Miss Lavinia,' Dorothy pleaded, with widening, deepening eyes. ' I hope not, Dorothy ; I hope not ; but don't be too sure in your own strength ; our friendships are sometimes cruelly tried ; and I have seen girls and girls interlace their arms and press their cheeks together for a whole year, and not know each other on the streets within six little weeks after. It is bad, Dorothy. I hope better things of you, but I want to warn you. You never heard me flatter ; so I think you will be lieve when I say I consider you the steadier girl of the two. Anne is a fine, handsome, kind girl, sure to be admired and liked ; but she is rash and impulsive. You are still, firm, and persevering. It may be that Anne will be volatile, but you must lend her your dis cretion. It may be that Anne will have her troubles, and fight against them like a wild bird in a cage, but you will stand by and coax the bird to eat and drink ; and when the time comes to open the cage- door, you will fly with it to its nest, Dorothy Fenton.' Dorothy did not answer, but she looked with her shy eyes full into Miss Lavinia's face. There was some-"], [207, "Friendship. 193 thing puzzled, even a little stolid and stubborn, in her expression. Many persons would have been mortally disappointed in it ; but Miss Lavinia judged otherwise ' That girl will certainly do what I have said, so tha. the opportunity be granted to her.' Who knows but she may 'save a soul alive, and cover a multitude of sins?' and Miss Lavinia rose and went about her night's duties. Anne Baldwin and Dorothy Fenton went back to homes plain and boisterous, according to the fashion of the time and place. They entered into the society of their age and station, and attended the usual num- ber of merry-makings in their scarlet morocco shoes, short-waisted gowns, and hair in clubs, lifted up on the crowns of their heads, rendering Anne Baldwin, a tall woman by nature, a giantess by art, and Dorothy Fen- ton a very funnily toupe'ed little girl. The girls did not reside in the same district, and did not meet above once or twice a year ; but they kept up a regular cor- respondence by letters ; queer, original letters, not very well spelt, or very grammatically phrased (save Miss Lavinia !), but quite individual epistles, full of a flow of nonsense on Anne's part, and showing a tripping march of sense on Dorothy's side. Yet, strange to say, it was the sensible, painstaking letters which were the most affectionate in their constancy. There were interreg- nums in Anne's quips and cranks, and then there were sure to arrive two or three pages in succession of Doro thy's comical sedateness, when Anne reproached her self violently for her neglect, and was extremely attentive till the next temptation."], [208, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 194 In course of time the girls married. All girls mar ried then as duly as they put up their back hair, and wore whalebone in their sleeves ; and one reason of the uniformity of the custom was, that they regarded marriage purely on the Turkish principle of fatality, and married when they were a?ked, without any vexatious delay on the question of taste, or I am afraid of feeling. There is positively something imposing in the equa nimity with which our ancestresses accepted their fates, often without moving a muscle to influence them. ' If it's ordained I maun take him, Who will I get but Tam Glen ? ' was a sentiment thoroughly credited and universally followed. Either there was a mistake in tne theory that every woman had her tide to love and be loved, or the mischievous Pucks must have been particularly busy at that season of the world's history. Whom did Anne and Dorothy marry ? Be sure not two likely lads as they were girls. Anne married an old bachelor, finical and fractious ; Dorothy married a blustering, rough-riding widower, with half a score of children, some of them as old as herself. Mr. Cross thwaite of Crossthwaite was caught by Annie's boldness and blitheness ; so different from his own pining, peevish humours. Mr. Annesley of Waveringlea was caught by Dorothy's youthful staidness. But what caught the girls? Nothing but the divine right of matrimony. They did not even name it as an induce ment, though they reckoned it a lucky chance that the two square, solid, unornamented grey-stone houses of"], [209, "Friendship. 195 Crossthwaite and Waveringlea, built as if to resist storms, were raised on lands which marched acre to acre in that Valley of the Tyne, where the smoke o the blast-furnaces was just beginning to shrivel the apple-blossoms in the Tyne orchards. If any girl is tempted to He as regardless of conse quences as these women of a bygone generation \u2014 and satirists harp on such to this day \u2014 they had better ascertain if they have spirits to bear the fortune in the sequel ; not mount to Arthur's throne if they cannot wind Arthur's horn. What lives Anne and Dorothy led ! What trials they endured ! Not that they com plained often. Not that they considered their lots par ticularly hard, or reflected on Providence after the first flush of their sanguine simplicity leapt out in their honeymoons. Mr. Crossthwaite was a weary, wizzened, what they called in old language, humoursome man ; to be felt for too, because he was poor and proud ; and if he had not a great soul, he had certainly a sensitive temper. His aged querulousness was more than a match for Anne's youthful cheerfulness. In place of Anne crossing and racking Mr. Crossthwaite, it was he who crossed and racked Anne, until the determined, headstrong woman waned into a being as fretful and nervous as himself. And all the time, Mr. Crossthwaite no more meant to injure his wife, than any other honourable, Christian gentleman who worries himself and his partner out of all the calmness and elasticity of existence. Anne knew that he was innocent of evil intentions ; and she herself"], [210, "196 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. was neither malignant nor revengeful, though she was cross many a time, so cross, that she declared they had been called Crossthwaite on purpose. She submitted to his whims and crotchets, piques and passions, like a tolerably resigned, hapless slave, and only once thought of flying in his face, breaking from his bonds, running away and setting up a separate establishment. That ivas when Mr. Crossthwaite had a bitter quarrel with Mr. Annesley, and each gentleman forbade his wife, on the pain of his utmost displeasure, to pass the threshold of his neighbour. They said nothing of the hills and fells, however, and there the two middle-aged women held a tryst like a pair of lovers. I think there was some thing far sadder and more pathetic in that single rendez vous on the hillside, and seat on the turf-dyke, than in many lovers' meetings and partings. No future to look forward to, no entire and perfect union in anticipation ; only the privilege of sharing each other's cares and sor rows ! Two beaten women, in caps with lace borders, and black bonnets, and coats not unlike their husbands' driving coats, and uncouth country mittens, holding each other's hands, and looking into each other's sore lined faces ! Anne raged and cried like a frank, impetuous woman. Mr. Crossthwaite was ill to please ; so fault-finding, that no servant would put up with him. It was lonely at Crossthwaite without either chick or child. Anne would have made up to the next heir, but Mr. Crossthwaite had a spite at him, and was sure he would start a furnace in the old rookery whenever he (Mr. Cross-"], [211, "Friendship. 197 thwaite) was gone. Anne would not mind it, if Mr. Crossthwaite sank for iron and smelted it under the win dows ; there would be some stir, and some glow about the place; the roughest Northumbrian burr ofthe miners and keelmen would be better than the croak of the crows that was so dismal, or Mr. Crossthwaite's thin voice snap, snapping at everything and everybody. He was not aware of it, but he was killing her by inches. And now, Dorothy, her old schoolfellow \u2014 Do, who listened to her, and comforted her, and helped her, if ever woman did another, \u2014 she was to see her no more. Anne could not bear this last drop in her cup, she could not bear it ! (A hard saying that ; not to bear the cross which we have helped to fit on our own shoulders.) Dorothy had been listening with her old stillness, which rendered her a welcome recipient of her vivacious neighbour's rush of fun and folly once. I think it was Mr. Annesley who set aside Dorothy by that title of Dame Dorothy, to hold her distinct in his memory from another dame, his first helpmate. At any rate, she was commonly known in the country, and she was mostly mentioned at Waveringlea as Dame Dorothy. Her name remained on a grimy Tyne ship long after it had died away from living lips. She was a very close woman ; one of those women whom the open, indifferent world is inclined to regard with distrust, and who, therefore, become peculiarly the property of their family and friends, remain devoted to them, are prized by them as gold. To all Mrs. Crossthwaite's boiling-over confessions."], [212, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 198 Dame Dorothy had said little or nothing of her own experience. It was only by vague but persistent rumour that Anne had acquired a notion that all was not well at Waveringlea, that Dorothy \u2014 quiet, composed Dorothy \u2014 had her own contentions. Now Dorothy just lifted the veil ; gave a glimpse of the husband, not unkind in his better moments, but in his worse, gross in his habits and shameful in his excesses ; of the step-children, riot ous and rebellious, straining at her reins, and indignant at her rule ; of her own children, looked upon as aliens and intruders ; and of her own faith and honesty sus pected every hour, because the little ones were her flesh and blood. Anne shrank back horrified. But Dorothy was quiet ; Dorothy was not calling her self a victim ; Dorothy was not thinking of throwing down her trust, and escaping out into the wide world to live for self, and ease, and pleasure. Like coid water to a fevered man, or the fresh breeze to a fainting body, Dorothy's patience and self-posses sion came across Anne's passions. Anne grew calm under the influence ; she rose up in her right mind. ' It is true we all have our battles to fight ; we must do our best, my lass,' she granted gently. There is some thing very touching in a high-spirited woman's meek ness. There is something also that 'gars the heart grow grit' in girlish appellations, exchanged by shri velled lips. ' Dorothy,' said Anne, with a sorrowful smile, ' do you remember when we first came Tyne ways, I once"], [213, "Friendship. 199 nearly quarrelled with you, because you chanced to sit above me at the table at the Oakshaw gathering ? But the next time you took the lowest place, though your husband was the older, weightier man, and you smiled and nodded up to me. I never saw you look so gay.' Life went on wearing its channels deeper, and sealing the impression of its scars. Mr. Crossthwaite, from being a discontented, restless man, waxed irritable and jealous, to a degree that was little short of mania. Anne dared no longer resist or oppose him. Anne grew to quake at that white, worn face, those quavering accents, and clutching fingers, more than Dorothy dreaded her husband's thick, stuttering voice. staggering step, and blind, purposeless fits of fury. Mr. Crossthwaite had always been offended by the iron-works. A narrow-minded, arrogant man, he hated to see another class rising up to crow over, thrust aside, and trample down the smaller squires. He had not the funds to work the minerals on his own property, and he took an insane pride in refusing the largest bribe to lease them to others. Waveringlea bordered Crossthwaite. Mr. Annesley had reason to suppose that the same metals were to be found on both estates. He had proposed trying their nature, and bring them into the market himself; but his irregular, wasteful life had left him with little power for enterprise. At last, when some additional fuel fed the flame of his feud with Mr. Crossthwaite, he swore he would be even with his adversary on this score."], [214, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 200 Nay, he would get his foot before him, and leave Cross thwaite far in the rear. Mr. Crossthwaite might not choose to bore and dig for his own stone, and blast it when secured ; but he could not prevent Mr. Annesley turning up and smelt ing his. There, right in front of the windows ot the old Northumbrian mansion - house, would rise the pyramids of red brick, belching fire and smoke, the rows of mean labourers' houses, the heaps of cal cined ore, the pegs of dull, leaden-coloured metal. What although the sky should be all ablaze of nights with the furnace-flames, and the roar be like the roar of the sea, and drowsy darkness and quiet should for sake the neighbourhood for ever ? What although the sickening fumes of the roasted stone should be carried by the lightest wind to blacken the linen bleaching on Mrs. Crossthwaite's green, to blight Mrs. Crossthwaite's flowers in their straight beds, and ascend far above hei sweet Nancies and March violets, to turn the weak stomach and the dizzy head of the fine gentleman who now owned Crossthwaite ? Mr. Annesley could not help that, he declared, with a horse-laugh. In this free England of ours, every man acts for his own interest, and lets his neighbours' concerns take care of them selves. Mrs. Crossthwaite wrote to her old friend, Mm. An nesley, a piteous letter, very different from her old letters with their merry chronicles of parties, partners, and fashions. If Mr. Annesley did as he threatened, she believed Mr. Crossthwaite would go mad. She did not"], [215, "Friendship. 201 think his life would be safe, or hers, or the Annesleys. She prayed to be saved from her misery. She implored Dorothy to interpose, and stand between her and her doom. Dorothy approached the subject in her own way. She addressed Mr. Annesley one day when he was at home, alone with her in her sitting-room, in his senses, and clumsily kind, with a species of contrition, as he was wont to be on these occasions. ' Tony, I've not been a bad wife to you.' ' You have not, Dorothy ; but I had rather that you did not remind me you've done your duty; I like to find that out for myself, my woman; I've a preju dice on the point,' he remonstrated with himself and her, as if he foreboded reproaches, or his conscience galled him. 'And I've not asked any favours of you, Tony.' 'Oh, is that it?' brightening greatly. 'It is the silk gown at last, and you shall have it, Dame Dorothy, as thick as leather, and as shiny as seal-skin, if money can procure it. The first dame's shall be nothing to it, for I must confess, though she was the bigger woman, you are the better bargain.' ' Tony, will you delay the mine in the Beck field, for my sake ?' Annesley's brow grew black, and his veins began to swell on his forehead, and to tighten his neckcloth. ' It is only delay, Tony ; that man's life is a bad one. ' It shall be in that man's life ; it would not be p"], [216, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 202 half worth, if he were not here to see it,' shouted Annesley. ' I know you are short of money ; you will be better provided for the outfit when a few more years have come and gone, and the mortgage is paid and done with. I will save every penny of money I can lay by for you, in the meantime.' ' If I could not get the money to borrow, I would beg it, my wife.' Tony mocked her. 'You remember, I would not consent to Martin's coming home again, because he was wild and frantic when interfered with ; I will try him another time, Tony. And I was pressing you to send away little Susan to school, that she might have the same advan tages which her sisters received, and which I enjoyed myself for that matter ; but I think I will manage to give her what I know at home, and avoid straitening you in that quarter.' He sat looking at her with a strange expression. He was a rude, ungoverned man, but he was not incapable of responding to rare magnanimity. ' I do not understand you, Dorothy,' he said at last ; ' you have taken me aback ; but I see the sparing that venomous, puny caitiff, Crossthwaite, is very near your heart, else you would not make these osiers.

Michael Crossthwaite lived on, unaware of the respite, insensible to the interference which had saved him from destruction. And Dame Dorothy could not do enough for her husband, or beg his pardon more hum bly in her unobtrusive manner, though he never re minded her of the obligation, or complained of the de ferring of his hopes and wishes. Nay, he did not seem hurt by his concession and pledge ; he was if anything a shade more moderate in his behaviour, and when he was not beside himself, he was kinder and kinder to Dorothy. One cold winter morning, when the water was frozen two inches in the water-barrel and the horse-trough, when the white clouds were curdled in the greenish-blue of a December sun-rise, when the drowsy farm-folk were only creeping abroad in the wreath of mist which hung over the mansion and its offices, and Dorothy had gone into the family-room to set out the children's bread and milk, and inspect the toasting of Mr. Annesley's ale, and the infusing of her own cup of tea, she was startled by a sharp tap on the thick glass of the window. A tall, wo-begone woman, with her clothes huddled on her back, and her hood tied over her sleeping-cap, stood outside among the hoar-frost. ' Anne Baldwin, can this be you ?

Why did you not send, and I would have gone to you at any hour, night or day ? ' ' I cannot stay, Dorothy ; I cannot see his enemy ; but I came over on purpose to tell your husband of the death. Basil Crossthwaite, the heir, will take possession to-day, and he will only wait till after the funeral to sink his mine. Your husband must have the first chance ; it is but justice, Dorothy. I have left my dead husband to strangers, to do your husband justice.' ' Poor soul ! did she face the biting wind, and the dark morning, after she had seen his spirit pass, and wander here alone to see me get fair play, to give me notice that I might work out my ends \u2014 me that would have struck him where he lay ? Do you think she cared for him, Dorothy ? ' inquired Annesley hoarsely. ' I think she cares for him now, Tony ; she forgets all else save his sufferings and his departure. It is the way with many a woman at a time like this. I daresay she blames herself at this moment that they were not happier; it was herself she was reflecting upon, not him, when she said he would never vex anybody more.'

' I've no great fear for the children ; Anne had always a fine way with young people. If she were recovered from this blow, she would deal with them a sight better than I can do; she would win their con fidence, and help them to a bit of pleasure, and they would never think her false. But I dare not, Tony, for, though you would not say a word to harm her when you were yourself \u2014 I know you would bite your tongue out sooner \u2014 some night when the wit was out, you might turn upon her.' ' Oh, Dorothy, don't be so hard upon me ! ' groaned Annesley. ' Yes,' continued Dorothy, in her even, steadfast tone ; ' and after what you've done for her, I would rather die than see my husband maltreat the woman whom he had bent to the earth with a benefit, and that woman Anne Baldwin.' ' Dorothy, I'll never forget myself, and disgrace you, mv girl. Give me the chance ; I'll rather sit lightly to my cups, and come home as sober as his Reverence for the remnant of my days.'

My thought is that love, more than marriage, is made in heaven ; that it is an inspiration which descends upon us without our knowledge, and often without our con sent.

I believe if the multitude of warnings against love in general were addressed solely against false love, it would be more for the moral benefit of society ; that is, if society would listen to the advice and lay it to heart. It is against spurious love that I would warn girls. I would disabuse love of all but its individual mystery, \u2014 delicate, hidden, and sacred as the religion of the soul.

True humour no more destroys soundness, dignity, sweetness, and pathos, than it soils our precious old ballads, our more precious old human life. There are very few grave and lofty elements in our manhood or womanhood, which, as they are worked out in flesh and blood, have not their ludicrous balance. It is recorded with honour to us, and on suffi cient testimony, that the more entire our trust in our fellows, and the fonder our appreciation of their fine qualities, the more readily we begin to play with what strikes us as whimsical and grotesque in their com position. Thus friends bandy jests ; thus there is nothing pleasanter than to see loving children mer rily stroking against the grain certain odd hairs in the coats of indulgent parents, who submit to the process (which they know they can end by a glance or a word) with the exceeding satisfaction of well conditioned tabby cats, whose kittens will sport with their whiskers ; or of benevolent ewes, whose way ward lambkins will lie down beneath their mother's chins.

It is, in almost every case, our disengaged girls, the gadders on our streets, the flaunters before society, the showy, frivolous, arrogant, reckless gamblers for matri monial stakes, who thus fall under just condemnation.

The peril is greatly increased by the stolid silence which is preserved in many families on the highest of human affections, or the derision with which the lightest allu sions to the most prevailing of human influences is re ceived. A young girl grows up in ignorance of what is likely to be the mightiest motive power of her destiny ; excepting, indeed, what she learns by instinct, or rather from her giddy schoolfellows.

Blackness was a prim little sea-port, in spite of its salt flavour ; more of a dwelling-place for retired men of business, and widows with settlements and annuities, than a place of trade. It was a monotonous little town, though its ships went and came ; and there was a marked equality throughout the better class of its in habitants. A widow's daughter, and a widower's son \u2014 a young"], [231, "Love. 217 man of five-and-twenty, and a girl of twenty \u2014 both resident at Blackness, both well-enough born, well enough inclined, well-enough educated, well-enough looking ! Surely there could be no great disparity here, and yet the sand and the surf in Blackness bay, which were destined to be constantly together without ever amalgamating, were not more distinct from each other than Marjory Bruce and Jack Fergusson. Their coming together at all was one of the curious and inter esting puzzles of social life. Marjory Bruce, though she bore the name of a king's daughter, was a humble -minded girl ; a good deal put upon and kept down in the world's war fare. Her father was the only Bruce of Blackness who had gone abroad and not brought home money ; and the other Braces and their families, who had been more energetic or more acquisitive, rode in a rough-shod fashion over Marjory and her mother. Mrs. Bruce, seeing her husband's kindred treat it as a grievous flaw on his part, that he had not gathered gain, grew to resent it on her own account ; and when the offender died, by some singular but perfectly practicable course of reasoning, she transferred the offence to his daughter, and always talked to her of what she might have been, and what she might have done, as if Marjory were at the bottom of the defalcation. She was a weak woman, Mrs. Brace; weak in body and mind; though I do not mean that she was incapable of knowing right from wrong, or of controlling her own actions. She invariably took the tone from those around her ; she"], [232, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 218 constantly required a grievance to nurse ; and, certcs, what with her own delicate health, her narrow income, and Marjory's comparatively defenceless and unpro vided-for condition \u2014 all contrasted with the robust health, full purses, and many brothers and sisters of the other Bruce houses, she was well furnished in this respect. Marjory grew up in a poor soil ; she went abroad with a blight upon her, from her earliest years. She had never gone to church or into company, without previously listening to a lamentation on her plain bon net, or her shabby shawl, or her washed muslin, or her cleaned gloves. She might have grown out of all this a buxom and hilarious woman ; for an injudicious regimen has sometimes the effect of sending the per verse plants of human nature shooting and spinning in a direction quite contrary from what might have been expected. But, as it happened, she grew up sensible, rather than light-hearted. She was indifferent to the forms on which her mother put so much weight, but there was a racy strength and sweetness far down at the core of her heart, budding out of the sap, which had been so forced back and compressed within its boundaries of bark. She was not pretty (here another Jeremiad from her mother !), and she was not ugly. She was strong rather than graceful ; she had a quantity of fine black hair, but though it was fine and well-dressed, its weight and mass were detrimental to a heavy head and face ; and she had thick, straight eye brows. Still her mouth was one of those beautiful, clear, delicate, yet full mouths, which redeem much plainer"], [233, "L.OVC, 219 faces than hers. She was not accomplished, and she was a little given to silence. But, for all that, I am proud to say, for the credit of Blackness, that she was admired and liked in her native town. I believe it was because she was thoroughly unaffected, because she was original ; that when she did speak, her words were worth listening to, and because she could be depended upon both by friends and foes. There was not a more sincere girl in existence than Marjory Bruce, and that in spite of a subservient position, and many temptations to irony, if not to flattery. But, notwithstanding the fact that Marjory Bruce had her genuine admirers, there was a great sensation at Blackness, when it spread abroad that Jack Fergusson had engaged himself to her. Marjory would never have made it public. She would have kept all the joy and pride to herself, but Jack could keep nothing to him self; and really, poor fellow! he was thoroughly proud and joyful over his conquest, in a way that might have done one good in this nonchalant, self-conceited age. It did bring water into Marjory Bruce's eyes an infinite number of times. ' I cannot think what Jack sees in me to cry out about ; a very humdrum, plain girl : nobody will envy his obtaining his choice ; but I should like to see who will persuade Jack of that fact' I should like to have seen who would have persuaded Jack that Marjory Bruce was not the fairest, brightest, noblest, best woman that ever lived ; that she was any thing short of angelic. He was the manliest, ablest, handsomest, and, alas ! most facile fellow on this great"], [234, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 220 globe. His father was a jovial, selfish man, holding a town's office ; who was safe of his comforts and amusements during his life, and left his boy to shift for himself. He liked him, I believe, but he never took any trouble about him. Jack hung as he grew anyhow, adored by the servants, welcome to every house in the town, learning what he liked as a boy at the grammar-school, and leaving unlearned what he disliked, according to instinct or fancy. He saw no example of self-denial, and, absolutely, he had no idea of it. That was the seed of corruption in a character otherwise one of the purest, truest, gentlest, most guile less that ever existed. He was clever too, acute, in genious, but sadly desultory and volatile ; yet I no more wonder that Marjory Bruce loved the ground he trod upon, stuck to him through thick and thin, bore with his failures, and clung to him, than that she loved the sun above her head, and the flowers and grass be neath her feet. Mrs. Bruce did not cherish brilliant expectations of the connexion which Marjory was to form with Jack Fergusson. At certain times, she allowed that Jack was gentleman-like, popular, warm-hearted ; but, then, he had no inheritance, he could not of necessity succeed to his father's office, though he was one of his clerks, and, I am afraid, the idlest and flightiest. If he had been like his father, now ! Actually, there is no accounting for tastes. Mrs. Bruce preferred the portly, wine consuming father, who never did anything disagree able, never even contemplated it, to the fine, brave,"], [235, "Love. 221 generous son. It was only an engagement ; still, it prevented Marjory from drawing something like a prize in the lottery of life, though Mrs. Bruce had not before contemplated her making a fortune by mar riage or otherwise. She had been accustomed rather to contemplate her as a pinched old maid, with little to do, and few to care for her. So Mrs. Bruce grumbled over Jack Fergusson's broad shoulders and his beard ; grumbled over him, as he helped Marjory to find her ferns, and train her dog, Ranger; as he brought her home from her aunt's carpet-dances ; as he was even induced to sit and read to her sober, earnest books, on sober, earnest occasions (and you have no idea how difficult it was to arrest Jack, and fix him on a seat, and constrain him to let his thoughts follow the guid ance of another, however lofty and loveable the teacher), and as he hung about Marjory, like the miser about his treasure. Mrs. Bruce, Marjory's mother, talked about Marjory's engagement to the other Mrs. Braces \u2014 the wealthy, dash ing Mrs. Bruces, whose daughters had contracted no en gagements \u2014 until she saw it a very doubtful good for Mar jory. She saw it as a long, dangling engagement, noised abroad by the inconsiderateness and indelicacy of Jack Fergusson, compromising Marjory, doing her a world of harm ; in fact, one of those flowery snares, which, in the end, hang like a noose about one's neck, if they do not strangle the breath out of one's body. And, as water frets stone, Mrs. Brace began to drop, drop peevish murmurs, and evil prognostications against Marjory's"], [236, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 222 engagement and Marjory's future; against Jack ler gusson, Jack's jests, Jack's restlessness, Jack's love of company, Jack's imprudence and extravagance, Jack's whole man, Jack's whole prospects. Marjory had to fight against two anomalies. Mrs. Bruce, who must needs be the echo of somebody, was the echo of the selfish, hard sisters-in-law, who lorded it over her, and bespattered her with their patronage, and not the echo of her own daughter, and only child, whom she loved as well as she could love any human being. ' Only listen to me, mother ; only hear what I 've got to say,' Marjory would implore in vain. In this case, ' familiarity bred contempt,' the consanguinity of the speaker, the power her mother possessed ovei her, the affection she entertained for her, were so many barriers against her. They barred the doors 01 so much reason as Mrs. Bruce possessed against Mar jory's and Jack Fergusson's opinions and arguments, and opened them wide to the slights and sneers, the innuendoes and hinted commiseration of her sisters-in law, and their satellites. And, be it said, the ill-natured gossips of Blackness proceeded to hang Jack Fergusson at a very early date in his history. The other hopeless quicksand in which poor Marjory floundered, was the notable circumstance that some of Jack Fergusson's virtues did the work of vices against him, degraded him in the world's estimation (liked and loved as he was), and exposed him to danger, rendered doubly, trebly precarious by very unstable fortunes."], [237, "Love. 223 It was honourable in Jack that he never courted a man for his wealth and rank ; that he had a decided inclina tion to stoop to those who were unjustly slighted and despised. And, I daresay, it was because he had a con viction that Marjory Bruce was not so exalted as she should have been, \u2014 that fools preferred more skin-deep qualities, or more mercenary lures, that he rushed to adore her. Above all, he was hot and passionate for the wronged, and started to their rescue with a head long gallantry becoming a squire who had his spurs to win. Now all this might bring him nearer the king dom of heaven, but it by no means promoted his in terests on earth, seeing that he was not a pillar of discretion on his own foundation ; that he was rash, confident, careless. And Marjory heard continually of his rubs with society, and had continually to condemn the world for base injustice on his account. Of course, Jack Fergusson did not get on in his father's office, \u2014 the easiest place for his father to put him. He had no great scope for his talents, nor for his occasional fits of industry ; and he did not improve what scope he had. He did not advance as attorney, agent, banker, for whatever branch of calling he meant to adhere to. At the end of two years, he was no farther forward in the world ; he was farther back. He had lost a portion of the confidence of embryo clients, embryo borrowers and lenders ; he was not a hair's breadth nearer keeping a house and maintaining a wife, to which he had been guilty of the ambition\u2014pre sumption, Mrs. Bruce called it now\u2014 of aspiring. The"], [238, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 224 Mrs. Braces (aunts) shook their heads more ominously and emphatically, and whispered, Should not something be done ? would not husband number one or husband number two interfere, apply the goad to Jack Fergus son's laziness and levity, or free Marjory of the engage ment by a quarrel and a rapture ? Marjory and Jack Fergusson laughed aloud at that conclusion in the twilight parlour ; laughed in utter derision, with their hearts warm and fond, with their bodies vigorous and blooming, with Jack's last kiss on Marjory's yielding lips, and his last look in her eyes, which had learnt to beam back the flash of his own, as the sea reflects the sun. But, for all the laughter, the relatives' and acquaintances' friendly suggestions infused sundry drops of gall into Jack's spirit. What ? wrench him asunder from Marjory ; rain him ; blast his heart and life because he did not arrive fast enough at promotion ! The harpies, the screws, the horrible curmudgeons ! From that moment, Marjory detected a subtle but potent element of hostility, kept in the back-ground not to vex her, but sufficiently active in all Jack's deal ings with her kindred. Jack began to look upon him self as an ill-used man, to feel hated, to grow reckless, desperate. It was Marjory that proposed to Jack Fergusson to go abroad, to cross the seas, brave rough passages, foreign railways, strange climates, unfriendly faces. After much sad reflection and many prayers, it seemed to her that it would be best for him, and she brought"], [239, "Love. 225 herself to recommend it. She did not mind herself, of course. She would follow. It would be easy for her when he was there ; easy, when Marjory suffered from one of those strange, constitutional weaknesses which beset many wise men and women ? She had a posi tive horror of the sea, rolling and buffeting its surges round her temporary home. She could not sail a few hours without uneasiness and apprehension, and yet she could propose to traverse an ocean, single-handed, for a glance of Jack Fergusson's eye, at a beckon of Jack Fergusson's hand. There are women who can be so mad. Jack was startled by the proposal, but he liked it, and a very little time served to reconcile him to it as feasible and promising. It seems to me that his willing ness was an instance of his selfishness \u2014 or rather his self-indulgence, even though Marjory was silly enough to instigate him. He could have put his shoulders to the wheel and managed the business at home, if he had spent his whole strength upon it, and relinquished other delectation than what was included in doing his own particular work, and looking for ward to his own particular wages ; if he had con descended to small beginnings, and braced himself, like a Titan or Trojan, to unflinching efforts. But, you perceive, it was a much simpler and more agree able affair, for a man with his education and ten dencies, to set off in pursuit of adventures, on a wild goose chase for a ready-made fortune. There was Jack's destination to settle, and his outfit"], [240, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 226 to prepare, and the parting to be gone through ; events from which his mind was to be diverted by change of scene and active progress, while Marjory was to brood over them during the tedious course of the draughts and plasters of her mother's spring influenza. Mrs. Bruce was not propitiated by Jack's withdrawal from the scene ; she did not see in it a chance of an escape for Marjory from an unlucky contract, or she resented that Marjory should have that chance. On the whole, she was more bent on seeing in it the fact of Marjory's banishment to the Colonies, to mourn over her daughter as an innocent convict, and herself as a deserted mother. She softened a little at the last moment, and allowed Jack to kiss her, and cried after his departing footsteps. Then her grief took the form of prognosticating storms and shipwrecks, revelling in yellow fevers and choleras, and feeling quite certain that she should never see him again. She thought Marjory was as good as a widow, and she knew, to her cost, what it was to be a widow in this unfeeling world. If Marjory had been a little German girl, now, she might have openly superintended Jack's outfit, trotted with him to the shops where he made his purchases, manufactured a large portion of his wearing apparel with her own busy fingers, accompanied him in his fare well visits, and never halted till she had seen him on board ship. The customs of the country were against her, but I believe she thought night and day for his benefit ; she hunted up the woman who was to be his"], [241, "Love. 227 sempstress, and intrusted him with the card of her name and terms, \u2014 envying every stitch the woman sewed for him. She read all the books of informa tion, at which he merely glanced, and, in the end, she knew a vast deal more about his destination and designs than he did, and she besieged heaven for blessings on his head. When the parting came, she kept him up. You often hear it said of some poor, slight woman, in her day of distress, that she cannot show her feelings, she must stifle them, in order to sup port some lump of a fellow, who would break down otherwise. Jack Fergusson was manly ; he would put a brave, cheery face on matters ; but when he took fare well (' good-bye,' he called it, for he would not for the world have termed it taking farewell), his impetuous heart was ready to break, and she knew that, and smiled upon him to the last Jack was gone, and Marjory was alone, dreadfully alone, after these last two years, at Blackness. She saw other girls light-hearted, comfortable, confidential, ex pecting their brothers for a week at midsummer, or when the universities and courts were broken up, or a: Christmas. She heard all the blithe anticipations, the merry appointments, the laughing retrospects. Young Mrs. Alison, who had met and married a Blackness man since she was engaged to Jack Fergusson, made her a party to her dismal condition when Mr. Alison went yachting for a fortnight, or on a tour in the High lands, or to London on business. At all hours Marjory was stealing out, and walking"], [242, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 228 forlorn through the plantations, and by the stream \u2014 the old haunts ; or sitting, heart-sick, on the shore, watching the sea-gulls vanishing beyond the horizon, and thinking of her Jack, wandering at the ends of the earth. The old Scotch songs teem with the eeriness of such plights ; hundreds of Nellies ' languish ' in their forgotten verses \u2014 ' Here awa, there awa, Wandering Willie, Here awa, there awa, hie awa hame.' ' Nae mair at Logan Kirk will he, Atween the preachings meet wi' me.' ' Now I gang lanesome and dowie and wae.' Sing these songs to yourselves in the pensive gloaming, and you girls will understand the state far better than I can explain it to you. You have all heard of home sickness ; it is hard to bear ; so hard that there is a pathetic, deep-meaning proverb, ' Blessed are the home sick, for they shall see home ;' but home-sickness is as nothing compared to the tugging at the heart-strings, when one who is the desire of the eyes is removed ouf of sight and hearing ; when one who is knit to the heart as a second being is carried away to the extremities of land and sea, and a blank and a chasm left behind. Such a watch, such a waiting is very trying to any tender woman ; enough, if she has no other refuge, to wear the flesh from her bones, drain the blood from her heart, and draw the light from her eyes. But when the object of devotion is a fine, thoughtless fellow like Jack Fergusson, who may be running his head against a post, or rushing slap-dash into a whirlpool"], [243, "Love. 223 any day; when the woman has advised, or even abetted his exile \u2014 oh, pity that woman, and take care to say to her, as Mrs. Bruce said to Marjory, ' Child, if you don't rouse yourself, and pluck up a spirit, and go out amongst other young people, you'll fall into a decline. I wish you had never seen that lad Fergus son's face ; but if he ever comes back again, he'll find you wrinkled and grey-headed before your time. And how will Jack Fergusson pay you back for your foolish cares, Marjory ? Girl, if he thinks you fallen off, and finds you no longer to his mind (and really, Marjory Bruce, you look an old woman already for your years), he won't have a gift of you and your love ! ' This is a climax for which girls are eager to barter their first joyousness. It must have its redeeming fea tures too, I suppose, just as you hear the oppressed mother of a troublesome family declare honestly that she would not be without her plagues, and dwell in peace and at leisure, for all the gold, gear, tranquillity, and amusement of her childless neighbour multiplied a thousandfold. So Marjory would not have gone back two or three years in her existence, and lived again without a constant source of anxiety and yearning for that broad-shouldered wanderer, no, not for any con ceivable reward. We all know the proverb about the rolling stone, and have had frequent opportunities of testing it. A mer curial, thin-skinned fellow like Jack Fergusson, who does no good at home, does not often do much good (in a money-making sense) abroad. Jack, tired of the"], [244, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 230 vain attempt, and longing to see Marjory again, re turned home considerably poorer than he went away. Poor Jack ! his ship was spoken at Blackness on the very eve of the marriage of one of Marjory's cousins. Such a satisfactory marriage ; so excellent, so unex ceptionable in every way ! A great merchant's son, holding a commission in the army, visiting some of the best people in the town, saw Louisa at a picnic, was struck with her figure, and enchanted with her singing, got an introduction, and made up the match in no time. Louisa was getting such ornaments, such dresses; for the regiment was particularly gay, and the colonel's wife particularly fond of young matrons under her wing ; and Louisa was to set up with a man-servant and a barouche at once. Louisa's mother had reason to be pleased and happy. Mrs. Bruce wondered, in a cutting way, that some people could be so shameless as to choose that time of all others to re-appear in the town, and inflict fresh annoyance and heavier mortification. Marjory was wearied of representing that Jack Fer gusson was not a prophet to predict Loo's marriage ; that he could not help his ship's coming in, and that he was not to linger on in the great sea-port ; that in a Christian country a man need not be banned outright, because he has not hit on the philosopher's stone. I can fancy Marjory's distraction of spirit at this time ; her eagerness to welcome Jack Fergusson home again ; her quick fear lest he should be keenly pained at the result of his travels ; the necessity she was"], [245, "L ove. 231 under of obeying, and deferring to her mother; the vexation inflicted by her enforced attendance at Louisa's marriage, with the invidious contrasts and condolences it provoked. If she had dared, instead of knotting favours and fastening bouquets, she would far rather have been making thoughtful provision for the serious gaps in Jack's spent wardrobe, laying up stores of neck-ties and collars, and slippers for his weary feet, that the poor fellow might appear respect able among his equals. I can see poor Jack's return at the fall of the night, in the fall of the year. No trumpets sounding before him ; no train gone out to meet him. It was not worth while announcing the event to his father, for the purple-faced old gentleman would not have refused an invitation, or risked his mutton being overdone in consequence of it. He had written a hurried note to Marjory, but of course she could not blazon the news ; so he turned in to his native town from the railway station when the lamps were lighting, and when he was free to walk the streets as a stranger. He came like the German Wandelbursch, brown and dusty, travel-stained and aching with fatigue ; and he trudged along just as that other pilgrim did, peering wistfully into the un conscious faces, feeling as if he had been much longer away, sensible that the town looked narrow and small and finical, yet that it thrilled him to a far greater de gree than any of the rousing commercial cities \u2014 where men struck the iron when it was hot, and forged pedes tals and statues to themselves and mammon before they"], [246, "Papers for Thoughts til Girls. 232 drew breath. Jack could encounter no little mother, like the Wandelbursch's, returning from the church, re cognising him at a glance, and falling with a cry of gladness on his breast, never pausing to look whether his staff bore a knapsack, or whether it presented a bare pole ; but he was more fortunate in his sweet heart. Jack, in his straightforward, heedless way, was plodding right to the Braces' cottage, when at the cor ner of the garden-wall, beneath the bour-tree bush, hanging in black winter berries, a woman started for ward, clasped two hands tight upon his arm, and laid her head on his shoulder. ' I have only brought back myself, Marjory, do you know?' Jack asked, with a long-drawn sigh some time afterwards, as if his letters had not told her the plain truth, upon this point, as well as on all others. ' You could not have brought back anything better ; you could not have brought back anything I would have liked a thousandth part so well. Oh, I am so glad, Jack ; so thankful to God to have you again !' Then she asked him if he was tired, for they would be more un disturbed to take a turn up and down for a little while ; it was only foggy, and she was glad of the air ; she had not been out that day before. Some of the guests who were to be present at her Cousin Louisa's marriage to morrow, were staying at their house. Jack would be very welcome among them, but she would not have him to herself. So the two walked backwards and for ivards in the lamplight and the drizzle, under Jack's riddled umbrella, for a blest half-hour ; such a half-hour"], [247, "Love. 233 as brides, in brilliant drawing-rooms, behind rosy cur tains, with approving friends burning incense before them, might well covet During the next few months, if Marjory Brace had not been invested with that strength and sweetness which was at her heart's core, and with the principle which ruled them, she would have been torn asunder by rival affections, she would have committed one of two great errors. She would either have given up Jack, and made peace with her mother ; or else she would have gone off to Jack, and rent one of the most sacred re lations of life, besides endowing him with a partner whose defiance of old ties was not very likely to qualify her to preserve and glorify new ties. She did neither, but like most enduring, upright individuals, she procured a standing-ground, and bore down opposition. Her mother never forbade Jack the house ; her relations never interfered actively to compel her to throw him over. Jack tried another office at Blackness ; but, oh, that want of application, what a fatal defect it is in a grown man ! and how hard it is to supplement its absence by late resolution, late adherence to plodding, painstaking, dry routine ! Jack could not do it yet, with all the inducement of Marjory Brace's love and faithfulness ; for if a man will not play the man for God's sake and his own, he will scarcely do it for a woman, though she be the apple of his eye. God had been good to him, and given him manly, tender impulses; but he had never concentrated and consecrated them by a new life of self-denial and self-devotion ; and such a lesson ia R"], [248, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 234 rarely learned in a day, even when a man has said his prayers, read his Bible, and gone to church with a single-hearted purpose all the rest of his life. Without this backbone to his virtue, Jack could not go erect either in the sphere which he now occupied, or in any other. Indeed, so far as present prosperity was con cerned, he would have fared much better, as Mrs. Bruce would have preferred him, without his sense of justice and his geniality. Had he been selfish, grasping, cringeing, he would doubtless have more speedily over come his volatility, forced his way in the world, and offered Marjory a comfortable, perhaps a magnificent home. But if I know Marjory Bruce aright, she would have spurned it at that price. I understand Jack again succumbed to disturbing in fluences in his career, hoisted the rover's perpetually shifting flag, and steered on a brand-new tack, from a quarrel with his master on the right of thinking for him self, and from certain sweeping censures which he saw meet to pass on the practices of the firm. ' Nothing to blush for, nothing to degrade him for a second in the opinion of any one whose sentence was worth listening to ; quite the reverse,' Marjory argued, but she could not hold the argument long. A man cannot touch pitch and not be defiled ; at least not a poor fellow like Jack Fergusson, giving way for ever to impulse, unsteady, unguarded, at open war with a multitude of his fellow-creatures, \u2014 not the ill-natured gossips alone, but respectable men and women, not withstanding some harsh prejudices. Such a one as"], [249, "Love. 235 Jack Fergusson had need of a cohort of angels to de fend him from a greater fall ; and he did wander into forbidden, miry by-ways, never with a will, never with out repulsion, loathing, and remorse. But how long would these sensations serve him ? until the self-respect, he had been unwittingly sapping all his life, was clean gone, until his conscience was seared and hardened. Ah, me ! we will not speak of Marjory Bruce now. Compelled to drink this bitterest cup of a woman's wretchedness, \u2014 the unworthiness of the man she has called her head. Oh, false, frail god ! how you have humbled her, together with yourself, and caused her to bite the very dust, even because she loved you as her own soul ! Marjory had reached what is a wild and maddening bewilderment to a woman, an enigma which people read in very different ways. I have heard good men main tain, that no woman who has once pledged herself to a man, and accepted his pledge in return, ought to give him up on this side time ; unless, I suppose, he con strain her to be his partner in sin. I have heard good women protest that a woman should relinquish a man, however dear, on the bridal-eve itself, if she has reason to suspect the purity of his faith and works ; that she should fly, like Lot from Sodom, for her own life, and leave him to perish in the burning city, if he is so in fatuated and accursed. I suspect the confusion rights itself. If a man be bad, he outrages the woman to whom he is bound, he casts her off in spirit or in deed ; he does not really want her honest, penetrating, exact-"], [250, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 236 ing affection. But Marjory was persuaded that the fitful letters she now received from Jack only breathed burning love and sorrow ; that he was a man beside himself, tempted and beset by a devil whom he would yet conquer and trample under his feet. Do not be angry with her, poor girl, for her credulity, because without it I do think thai strange thing might have happened to her, \u2014 her heart would have broken. Old Mr. Fergusson died surrounded by luxuries, and was found to have left no provision for Jack. What provision did a stout son with brains and hands want? He was a deal better without one. But a man who has brought up his family with extravagant habits, and has never afforded them a single instance of abstinence from pride, vanity, and sensual enjoyment, or of consecration of strength, health, and faculties of body and mind, had better, in common charity, heap up some wealth for his descendants, though it should appear an excess of in dulgence. Jack removed to London, that great net which draws in so many provincial fish, and keeps the good and honours them, but throws the bad away \u2014 whither, who can tell? Then Mrs. Brace was seized with the last of her many sicknesses. Poor woman ! she was more patient than she had ever shown herself formerly, lying there, shut out from the glare and glamour of life ; it was as if a breath from a region healthier and more generous had blown across her spirit. She would say, as she had never had the self-forgetfulness, or taken the time and thought to do in the old days, to Marjory, \u2014"], [251, "7^.ove 237 ' You have had a dea! to bear, my dear ; I hope you'll be happy yet' Precious words to Marjory. Jack Fergusson came down to the funeral ; and Mrs. Brace had no more decent, disinterested mourner there, though the dead woman had been no friend to him. In the afternoon, Jack went by himself to see Marjory in her empty house ; beginning that most forbidding aspect of life to a kindly woman's nature, a single woman's existence. Though Jack was by no means famous for tact, he had a consciousness that he could not ccntinue to go about Marjory Brace as he had done ; that their con nexion must come to an end sometime. Subdued as Jack was by the occasion of his visit, by his sensibility io Marjory's grief, and by his painful reflections that he might have been a true son, a veritable prop and stay to ' the woman who was a widow ;' whom he had helped to lay in the grave, and whose load he had not lightened by one hairVbreadth, if he had not piled additional fagots on her poor, shrunk, bent back, \u2014 this idea pressed upon him. Jack felt as if truly he were not worthy, as if he ought to tell Marjory so, as if he ought to free her from her long obligation to him, and bid her have no thing more to do with him and his ill luck. Barbarous as the blow might be at such a season, better have done with it than live on with it impending over their heads. But when Marjory came down to him from the room where she had been sitting with her aunts, in her black dress, with her dear beautiful lips pressed together to"], [252, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 238 prevent their quivering ; when she looked at him with such fixed eyes, when he sat alone with her at her hearth, Jack could not dissolve the last tie that bound him to paradise. A great agony of prayer came over him, and he rose and stood before her, and besought her, \u2014 ' Will you try me once again, Marjory?' And she got up and walked to his side, and put her arm round his neck. ' Until seventy times seven, Jack.' I believe a great awe came over Jack at the extent of that woman's faith. I believe that it sobered him, and steeled his light, loveable nature more than anything else he had encountered in the whole course of his life. I believe it gave him his first vivid conception of a matchless forbearance, an infinite love. Jack was able to marry Marjory before her black dress was laid aside. She only put it off on the pale February day, when she became his wife, to resume it the next working-day. That was one of the grave con comitants of a grave wedding, at a time when there were no flowers save Christmas roses, heavy with mois ture and stained with earth soils, and little winking hepaticas. Women are superstitious to the last ; they are averse to such omens ; they will have the sun shine, the flowers bloom, the bells peal ; and smiling, fond friends supporting them, caressing them, and wishing them joy. No true woman is indifferent to such ac cessories ; she regrets their absence ; she misses what should have been of life's gala. Yet none can dig up"], [253, "Love. 239 wells among the suphur-pits like women ; none can draw honey in such streams from the flinty rocks. A glimpse of the eager thankfulness which had replaced Jack Fer gusson's old riotous joyfulness made his mistress's faint heart glad. And, ah ! the bright star that rises for the righteous, the deep gladness that dawns on the true-hearted. I wish I could say, from my soul, that Jack Fergus - son and his household prospered amazingly from that moment. But I can say that he was like a man awakened from a sleep, and recovered from a fever ; and though he might still feel in a measure helpless, weak, liable to relapses, he mended fairly from that day. He and Marjory worked together, shared their straggles honestly, climbed slowly and staggeringly, but surely, to some degree of independence ; and surprised the Blackness world into admitting that Marjory Bruce's marriage had turned out a very tolerable marriage aster all. ' But it was not luck, Marjory,' Jack said, when they talked over their troubles on rare occasions ; for sound men and women are not fond of reverting to sorrows, far less to sins, unless to gather jealously the precious drops of balm they have shed. ' You ventured gal lantly, all in God's grace, for the love of me.'"], [254, "IX.\u00ab GODLINESS. A MONG gifts I reckon a long list : youth, intellect, beauty, favour, ambition, pleasure, friendship, love. Some of these may be ours for a time ; some may be, in a great measure, from first to last denied to us ; all may be taken from us. We may have them, or we may want them, and, terrible as the blank appears, we may certainly, in the light of another world, do without them. Of studies I reckon only two. 'These we must run after, if we are faithful, to our dying day; these, without reservation, are our actual posses sions, ours to foster, develop, mature here ; ours to practise and enjoy hereafter. The first is Godliness. Without some form of Godli ness, there can be no sure virtue, no firm principle. All excellence, not built on the foundation of the conception of God, the fear of God, the love of God, is the foolish man's house on the sand \u2014 ' the wind blew, and the storm rose, and great was the fall of it' Even irreligious men and women have a dim, restless, inconsistent per ception of this fact. A woman without God in the worid, is an awfully sad and strange spectacle. By"], [255, "Godliness. 241 woman came sin and death into the world; the seed of the woman braised the serpent's head ; the Lord was born of a woman; women followed his footsteps ; women ministered unto Him, women were last at the cross and first at the sepulchre. And of the Master's exceeding tenderness for women, we have a proof in His generous, mindful, touching speech, even, on the Dolor ous way, fainting under His own mighty sorrows and humiliations, ' Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but rather weep for yourselves.' A woman's heart, un softened by that divine love, unmelted by that incom parable sacrifice, \u2014 we repeat it, an unbelieving, reckless, crafty, vain, light woman is an awfully sad and strange spectacle. But just because the livelier feelings and softer tem pers of women render them usually more open to im pressions, there is the more need that these impressions should not prove flighty, fickle, spurious, or morbid. To women particularly applies that verse of the parable of the sower which represents the seed sown and ger minated, and sprang fresh and fair ; too quick and ready of promise, as it were, without depth of earth, and so when the sun shines, when persecution or tribulation comes, it withers away. Women are liable to be made up of impulses ; they require ballast ; even those of them who have comparatively strong, deep natures require discipline, constant discipline, to break and train the re bellious womanly nature. Now, do not mistake me. Godliness is a divihe grace. No man can come unto God, except the Spirit"], [256, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 242 of God draw him ; it is a spiritual effort ; they who worship God ' must worship him in spirit and in truth ;' but for all that, godliness is a study carried on by human perseverance and action, and the use of material means. Though it is our hearts which we lift to God in prayer, yet we also do Him the homage of the body ; and while we are in the body, with this mysterious double nature of ours, if we deliberately and wilfully lay aside the out ward homage, I would dread the non-continuance of the inward reverence. We speak to our Father in heaven in articulate sounds, because these are now the expres sions of our living souls. So our godliness must have not only a creed and a ritual, but a regular acknowledg ment in our day. Far be it from me to wish to fetter any free spirit, to dictate a channel of grace, to constrain to a course of duty ; but writing to young girls, I would ask them affectionately to keep in mind the good, lowly, wise truth \u2014 ' Little things on little wings Bear little souls to heaven.' The act of eating and drinking seems to us a very small, irrelevant, commonplace, contemptible business, and we are often guilty of presumptuously slighting the process ; but it is a serious one, nevertheless, for it is the source which preserves, or rather restores, the flesh and blood and bones of this mortal framework, in which it has pleased our Creator to place for a season our immortal soul, and which it is certainly not His will that we should destroy before its time. So our godli ness must be fed at stated intervals ; it must be refreshed"], [257, "Godliness. 243 and replaced by fresh aliment ; and although we do not see here the connexion of cause and effect \u2014 though the first may often, to our grief, be distasteful to us, as our natural food in ailing states of the body \u2014 we must humbly and perseveringly con our day's lessons, and strive to win from them their germ of pure vitality. I love the word Lesson, which the Episcopal Church gives to the morning and evening readings of its people. I have read the advices of good men on many kinds of daily spiritual diet, and have been honestly struck, again and again, sometimes with their impracticability, sometimes with their austerity, sometimes with their spasmodic vehemence, but I have never doubted that they contained their own indestructible seeds of excel lence ; indeed, that no excellence could well exist with out them. On the other hand, I have heard good people, in private life and in public, coldly despise, or pitilessly attack the simpler practices as the merest hypocrisy or superstition. I am not speaking of worldly people, who would have rather denounced them as phari saical. I am thinking of good people, who have grown stern or savage over an active young man still feeling it somehow a comfort to read a psalm in his prayer-book before he flung off his coat to prepare for rest, or a lively young girl experiencing a sedate gladness in reading and pondering her chapter before she tripped down stairs, to show the first and the brightest face at the breakfast table.

What would they have ? Are we not to say our prayers ? Are we not to search the Scriptures ? And can there be a more becoming, reasonable, reverent period for these exercises than in our mornings and evenings? And does not our reconciled Father him self, who knows the exigencies of our constitutions and has bestowed their instincts, allow us this sense of happiness in a void supplied, an obligation fulfilled ? Will He thus despise His children when they 'feel after Him,' gropingly, still loyal in their darkness and dulness ? And will He not rather bless them, and give them more and more light 1 We must know that the letter killeth, while it is the spirit which maketh alive ; and that without repentance, faith, holiness, and charity, our prayers and readings are but as so many dead cere monies condemning us like our other abused privileges.

Trust grace, sure in its promise, no less sure in its perform ance, and read your Bible, wishing and striving to do its behests. Look upon it as your storehouse and your armoury, and when times of ' refreshing,' or of trial, of life and work, or of decay and death, arrive, do not question but it will supply you with a share of victuals and weapons. Try the practice sincerely, un assumingly, and lovingly, and you may perhaps marvel at its power. Prayer is so lofty a subject, so private and intensely personal an interest, that a writer, who is not a com missioned servant of the Lord, may well shrink from obtruding an opinion on her fellows on a matter which is between them and their Maker. And yet who can dwell on godliness, and from delicate scruples omit the, mention of prayer ? After the Divine model of prayer, see that you pray your own prayer, and no other man or woman's; and consider the two invaluable sugges tions you have received \u2014 that your prayers are to be still and secluded communions, and that they are not"], [260, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 246 to be heard for their much speaking. Let them be very real prayers, cries for help, grateful thanks, adoring praise. Our Father in heaven, your Father and mine, as well as the Almighty God of the universe, will not be impatient of our little, fretting troubles, our trifling attainments, our feeble, faltering worship. He who cares for the sparrows and the ravens will heed the aching or the bounding heart. He will have our own words and not another's ; our own pleadings, wrestlings, and rejoicings, rather than the experience of even a David or a Moses second-hand. Blessed be His name ! He does care for our struggles and our victories, our weal and our woe ; and our Elder Brother cannot, either on earth or in heaven, lose his fellow-feeling, his entire and exquisite sympathy with his race. After the reading of the Bible and prayer, and keep ing that day in seven, which is given us to float as far as we can from worldliness, selfishness, and malice, and as near as we can to adoration, peace, and love, I be lieve that any other aim to this end of godliness is minor and relative. I take it for granted that no honest, good girl will wilfully and deliberately commit a known sin, however often, alas ! she may stumble and fall un awares in her career. What is not in itself sinful, is so far lawful. No doubt all that is lawful is not expedient. An apostle has said so, and we are bound to try to be enlightened on this expediency, with regard to our own welfare, and, above all, for our neighbour's sake, be cause the question of expediency seems to refer princi pally to our influence over our neighbour. But I think,"], [261, "Godliness. 247 generally, whatever is lawful is not only allowable, but under due limits and proportions beneficial. I do not agree -with those who would introduce a system of monachism into our social life, who regard God's world as the wicked world, God's kingdom of art as the devil's kingdom, and the deep, tender affections which our great Father has implanted in our bosoms as so many cords of idolatry. I would be a ransomed woman, and then, while per forming the work which has been given to me to do, I would not fear to relish all the comforts, pleasures, and joys which He has set in my path ; believing that God is well pleased with our contentment and gladness, that he asks and accepts the praise and thanks of our merry hearts, as well as the confessions and petitions of our mourning spirits. The church, in my heart, should have its festivals as well as its fasts. Thus, as minor and relative, would I regard all other religious reading after the study of the Bible. At the same time, I think a girl in earnest about godliness will have her eye on its promotion in some part of her gene ral reading. I would recommend her in this search, as an advice which cannot be repeated too often (so much are we tempted to adopt a parrot-like imitation of each other), to read what she feels applies to herself and pro fits herself. Not to insist on drugging herself with another person's medicine, too strong, or it may be too weak, or otherwise totally unsuited to her constitution and ailment. While frankly taking what God in his Providence"], [262, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 248 sends, and joining in the toil and the recreation of the work-a-day and holiday world, many good people are distressed by a sense of disruption between their spiri tual and their natural life. Probably nothing but expe rience, growth in Christianity weaned from selfishness, and a higher, closer, and clearer comprehension of, and communion with the Divine life will overcome this discord. John Wesley recommended short ejaculatory prayers, if no more than ' the Lord direct me ! ' ' the Lord help me ! ' and this corresponds literally with the apostle's ' pray without ceasing,' ' be instant in prayer.' Others have chosen a verse in the morning, to be as it were blended and intertwined with their day's occupa tions and enjoyments, so as to leaven them throughout. Certainly, when prone to covetousness, the admonition, ' let your treasure be in heaven,' ought to be an aid to us ; when driven to unrest, so should the meditation on the peace which was His bequest ; and when entangled in ambitious effort, and its accompanying strife, so should also the recommendation not to desire vain glory. Another habit, whose acquisition is frequently pressed upon us, is to review at night our day's transactions, and humbly acknowledge their success while we lament their failures, in order to have our conscience always clean, and in working order. To this has been added the glancing over, in the morning, a rough plan of what the day's duties, trials, temptations, pleasures, pains may be, with the intent ofa consequent preparation for them; guarding, at the same time, lest this should interfere with"], [263, "Godliness. 249 taking no heed for the morrow, and casting our cares on One who careth for us. But, let me reiterate, these are minor and relative obligations, and must always depend very much on the temperament, condition, and surroundings of the indi vidual concerned. They may be easily erected into eleventh commandments, and twisted into will-worship and bodily exercise. If held tenaciously, doggedly, ir. \u25a0a spirit of self-conceit, fussiness, or intolerance, they may not only be very injurious to the girl and woman relying on them, but to all those with whom she comes in contact, causing false inferences, unjust judgments, and inflicting grave wounds in the broad humanity of the gospel. I cannot find, that in the wide or concentrated laws of the Bible, there are any express injunctions to formal acts in the promotion of godliness beyond ' search the Scriptures ;' ' be instant in prayer ;' ' forsake not the assembling of yourselves together ;' ' do good and com municate.' The mantle is a wide one ; preserve its simple integrity, and its folds will fit the shape of youth and age, rich and poor, those whom the north gives up, and those whom the south keeps not back. Do not confine and cut it for mankind, according to your own poor taste and figure, at your peril. s"], [264, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 250 MISS VIOL. How can ye thole it, Miss Viol ? I cannot compre hend it' The speaker was an old man in hodden grey ; a stiff, consequential, working man, with the long upper lip, the long rabbit teeth, the long head, the long terrier back (though it was rounded now with years and labour), of a sagacious but opinionative old servant of the public. ' How can ye thole it, Miss Viol ? I cannot compre hend it.' The speech was out of keeping with the decided, or, as he would have called it, preceese character of Geordie, the gardener of the old-world town of Hatton, who managed his own little garden, and its cauliflowers and codlins, to his own mind, and domi neered over the gardens of his employers from seed time till harvest. The speech was not in his usual style, and the look was not the ordinary look of the egotisti cal, positive old man ; it was a softened, pitiful look from an inferior to a superior long known and respected, not for her glories but her tribulations. Miss Viol was a big, gaunt woman, in brown drapery with a tight look about her costume, as if she could not be cumbered with loose folds. Her face was raw-boned, as well as her figure, and her grey hair, dry and brist ling, corresponded with its harsh outline. She had Geordie's long upper lip ; but in Miss Viol's case, it did not convey the idea of the utmost limits of human con fidence ; it had no more than the sagacity which is"], [265, "Godliness. 251 malienj.ble from a long upper lip, and so far from being self assured it had a nervous twitch which betrayed a conscientious, tender disposition. Indeed, Miss Viol was not only wise in her generation, but so soft-hearted and soft-tempered with her thoughtfulness, that how she parried the strokes of destiny, maintained her single combat with fortune, and held on her tempestuous career, were standing miracles at Hatton. Miss Viol did not take it ill that old Geordie, whom she was hiring to ' dibble kale ' and ' sheuch leeks,' should allude to her misery. It was too widely and intimately known for her to be concerned to conceal it ; and perhaps that was the one rent of relief in the black clouds through which she passed in her life voyage, like the moon on a stormy night. Neither did she refuse commiseration from Geordie ; she was too meek a woman for that, and too set apart, as it were, and compelled, like the Ancient Mariner, to ask com miseration from all humanity. 'I dinna ken, Geordie,' answered Miss Viol, in her uncouth phraseology, with the slow, thick articulation of a woman who speaks seldom, 'unless it be by prayer and fasting \u2014 fasting from thoughts of self, and what might have been. Ye ken the very worst description of deevils could not abide prayer and fasting.' Miss Viol was the eldest daughter of the saddler of Hatton ; the man who occupied the corner house, with the dingy, stucco horse capering above his door ; a man who lived when saddlers drove a brisker trade than they do now-a-days, and when their peculiar traffic brought"], [266, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 252 them much in contact with rough country lairds and farmers. It was an age, moreover, when a boon com panion was prized as a treasure, or rather snared as a prey ; and when Adam Forsyth was young, he was no more like Miss Viol than a starling is like an owl. He was a merry, ready-witted man, careless in his habits, and coarse in his feelings, but not more so than many another bon-vivant in high or low life ; his full, flexible lips were constantly curving in broad mimicry, and meeting together with comical force in rich suggestions. Miss Viol did not resemble him in the least ; she took after her mother, who minded the shop, strove to rear her children and attend to her husband ; and who, worn and weary, dropped into her grave half-a-score of years before. Miss Viol stepped conveniently into her mother's shoes, young as she then was ; received orders in her father's frequent absences, kept accounts, endea voured quite ineffectually to control the thoughtless apprentices, spent long days stitching at ladies' saddles, and executing all kinds of artistic checkers in white silk on the stuffed leather. The sight of our mothers' side saddle always reminds me of Miss Viol, for that was the only fancy work she ever knew, and she had a fond pride in her exploits. As for recreation, she had the training of the younger children \u2014 a set of girls who, one after another, grew up the ' marrow ' of their father, with high animal spirits, strong passions, and very slender organs of veneration, justice, and benevolence. Not ten Miss Viols could have curbed these high heads, and held in these hard mouths."], [267, "Godliness. 253 Miss Viol was now known as the middle-aged, long suffering daughter of the tippling, boozing saddler of Hatton, with his light, younger lasses. Her charge was to defend the father from the results of his gross and inveterate intemperance, and to save the girls from vice and rain ; and night and day she laboured at a task fit to be compared with that of Sisyphus. Night and day she guarded the reckless, scoffing sisters ; morning after morning she sustained her father in his stupefaction ; night after night she bore with him in his madness. She was never absent from her post. That dark, mean parlour, with its grey drugget, its tawdry girls' finery, its silver plates and stirrups, and leather peaks and flaps, saw a sacrifice noble as Iphi genia's, a tragedy sad as Lear's; not a death by the knife, sharp yet swift, but a long anguish of dislike, apprehension, disgust, horror ; not one instance of ex pulsion, cruel and monstrous, but a slow torture of rejection as friend and counsellor, and bare sufferance as servant and slave. And Miss Viol was a timid, pre judiced woman, who screamed at a mouse and ran from a cow ! She bore it ; the pure, mild woman lived on in the foul atmosphere of vanity and sin, never relaxing her efforts, never relinquishing her hope. ' If I could but weather the wind with the light-headed lasses, and see them safely married off my hand ; though their men were puir men and dour men, I would not mind , they need their masters : if I could but see my father take to hamelier, cannier ways, I would not grudge the warstle with their tempers. I'm sure they're welcome to a' my"], [268, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 254 aught; they're well entitled to the best of me.' So mused Miss Viol, who stood by her colours while the vessel reeled and the shot rattled, and who would have gone down with them without a dream of desertion. Miss Viol was not only stanch, she was tranquil in her great trouble ; as she said, she prayed and fasted ; she fasted from self, and she prayed directly towards God's mercy-seat without doubt or distraction. She was grieved by the mystery of iniquity ; but it did not shake her living faith ; she read her Bible as another eats strong meat and drinks strong drink for nourish ment and stimulant ; and on this diet, like the prophet, after he had tasted angels' food, she travelled many a day in the waste, howling wilderness. I have used one simile with regard to Miss Viol so appropriate that I cannot forsake it for another. The moon rides securely among drifting, tempest-tost clouds, wan and yet steadfast, soft and yet clear : so Miss Viol knew adversity. I will say it for the rude little town of Hatton, it viewed Miss Viol like a planet in the sky ; it surrounded her with a broad halo of respect and goodwill. Not that she understood it ; she received their pity, but their praise would have scared her. Still you might have sought up and down, far and near, and not found a lady in the land more truly honoured than that plain, awk ward, uninformed woman. Night after night, in the long dewy evenings of sum mer, and the bitter, black nights of winter, Miss Viol sat nodding, until the small hours, over her feminine"], [269, "Godliness. 255 saddlery, or stumbled down the steep, narrow stair, to let in the sisters gadding from house to house, gossiping at street-doors, returning to break the silence of the ' hushed, holy night' with their loud defiant laughter. And again, when the morning-star was dying in the sky before the pearly white of the rising day, the same shuffling, spent foot crept out to admit a very beast into the house. Woe is me ! it was like an imprisoned angel dwelling with and ministering to Pan and his satyrs. More furiously boiled and bubbled the ferment and scum of the circumstances among which Miss Viol's lot was cast. Sister after sister whirled on the verge of the precipice, until their remaining atop, and not being dashed to pieces on the stones below, might have puzzled sages, had they condescended to study such paltry pro babilities. Adam Forsyth became so fatuous at one time, so frenzied at another, that it was a question for the safety of himself and his fellows, whether he should be left his own master. Cool strong men shuddered when they thought of him raging loose, during long nights, in a household of defenceless women. ' Na,' exclaimed Miss Viol, when she was examined on the point, ' I dinna trust Mysie and Ailie and Jean and Kirsty within his reach ; I send them quietly to their beds, and I lock the room-door when he happens to be very wild, and I've to sit up and bear him com pany.' ' And what, in the name of mercy, do you do yourself Miss Viol?'"], [270, "256 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. ' I'm not feared ; I say, \" Father, you maun be quiet,\" or, \" Father, you would not hurt me,\" and he leaves off what he's about ; and I read to him, or he reads to m\u00ab \u2014 he was aye proud of his reading \u2014 and though he for gets the place, he does not misca' the words. Na, you maun confide my father to me, others might be rough with him, and he would not survive the shame of being confined. You maunna even him to that. Trust him to me, and he'll do no harm, and you'll never rae it' It was in sheer regard for Miss Viol, because her heart was set on preserving her father's liberty, and on continuing his keeper, and because she impressed them with the singular weapon of her serenity, that the men granted her request. ' My dawties,' Miss Viol would coax the insensate sisters, 'if you'll no gang that gate the nicht, I'll put on my Leghorn and my Paisley shawl, and walk with you mysel' another road the morn's nicht. You would not be seen abroad with sic a sorry ? Hout ! I'm no bonnie, but I'll serve to set aff four sic strapping cummers as you are. You need not take the dorts, Ailie ; but if you will bring Archie Beltrees here, I must bring my saddle, and sit beside you. I might stay in the shop, that's the place for me, the place I'm fondest of, did you say?' Miss Viol had a habit of repeating her neighbours' sentences, trying to catch the sense and sound, which they did not trouble themselves to make plain to her, since, in the midst of her drudgery, the sense of hearing had prematurely failed her. ' Surely you would not have me set you lasses in my room, it is"], [271, "Godliness. 257 liker a grey-headed woman, sic as me, than a wheen daffin' lasses, sic as you ; though, I think, I did not daff when I was not grey-headed.

Archie will smoke, and bring on my hoast, is that it ? Well, I must hoast, and be done with it. I maun just stand a round of hoasting ; it will not finish me at this time of day.' The moon would not be driven from the sky, would not withdraw her beams, though the ragged, ruffian clouds closed her in on all sides, were piled up before and behind her, and every little while tore right across her patient face. It is hard to say what good Miss Viol effected in her ill-conditioned, rebel rout of a family ; but I can vouch she established such a standard of virtue in Hatton as is rarely excelled. In the way of example, that noblest preacher, Miss Viol, was a notable missionaiy. There comes a period to human wrong and sorrow. Adam Forsyth died in one of his fits of delirium, and Miss Viol wiped away her scalding tears. ' It is the will of the Father,' she whispered, ' I dare not speak up against Him.' Even that last awful dispensation could not cast Miss Viol from her rock. The head gone, the disorderly family sprung asunder in all directions, like beads when the string is snapped. Miss Viol had no longer the power, though she had the"], [272, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 258 will, to preserve the elements of disunion in unity. Some of the girls amended their errors in after life, and came to better ends than had been expected of them, for God is merciful, and the ways of his grace are manifold ; to them she would point with the most dis interested, the purest love and thankfulness. Others went swiftly to the lowest depths of degradation, and these she relieved to the last out of her own pittance, weeping tears of pity over them, and still hoping against hope in their reformation, when they thought no shame to come begging from her, and robbing her on whom they had preyed all their days. But Miss Viol was free ; free to occupy a peaceful, orderly home ; free to maintain herself decently by her curious saddlery. That single woman's life, so desolate to many a bereaved woman, was ' biggit wa's ' of safety, contentment, and abundance to Miss Viol. Her Book, her saddlery, her tea-pot, her cat, her geraniums, her friends, who claimed her now in kindly bands, were all her own. She said wonderingly in her modesty, \u2022 The warld was ower gude to her ; she had lived long in it, and never kenned it liked her so well ; she had done nothing for it, her hand had been taken up with her own folk.' She could not comprehend why the world should ' fash ' with her ; and had it not been for her good-nature, she would have been affronted by its courtship. ' And you'll no need to be so thrang with your reading and your prayers now, Miss Viol,' suggested Geordie, as he came across with a basket of his potatoes, his own"], [273, "Godliness. 259 finest kidneys, to present to her. Geordie's question was projected, not from idle curiosity, but to solve some doubt deep down in his own heart. I am sorry to say Geordie was suspected of heresy ; at the same time my private opinion always tended to this point, that his theological eccentricities proceeded from a certain thrawnness inherent in his constitution, which im pelled him to sow peas broadways instead of length ways, and to switch trailing roses, in defiance of the remonstrances of their owners. My idea was that the more you meddled with him, the more rootedly heretical he grew, and that, therefore, the less notice you took of his heresy the better. Miss Viol never interfered witii theories ; I doubt if she had any shapely theory of her own, and therefore Geordie had recourse to her in some long-standing perplexity. ' Na, Geordie, ye 're wrang,' explained Miss Viol, so unhesitatingly but unpretendingly, that Geordie sub mitted to be told he was wrong, like \u2014 like a man. ' I thocht for a while, like you, that my verses, and my psalms, and my petitions, and all but my praises might be laid by for the rest of my life, while I worked, and walked about, and pleased myself; but soon everything grew dreich and dreary, and my life was not what I hoped -it would have been ; my hearthstane was not so cheery, the very honey-suckles, and cock roses, and butterflies were not so sweet and bright as I expected, now that I had time to daunder by the hedges and loanings, and take a good look at them.

KINDLINESS. /^ODLINESS without kindliness I believe to be i delusion, and, like all delusions affecting reli gion, baneful both to those who are blinded and to those who are revolted by it. ' He who loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?' is a question which admits of no exception. As there is no sound, enduring kindli ness without godliness, there is no godliness without kindliness. Kindliness is an integral part of godliness : ' pure religion and undefiled is to visit the widow and the fatherless in their affliction, and to keep one's-self unspotted from the world.' In one sense kindliness must also be a work of God's grace ; but like godliness itself, it is to be nourished, strengthened, ripened by human energy and constancy ex erted on means. Kindliness must be a study to a good girl. But, in case of misconception, understand kindliness as standing for good-will, benevolence, mindfulness, and mercy ; which may exist in company with plainness, stiffness, starchedness, seriousness, and even an exterior of sternness ; and which is quite irrespective of a soft"], [276, "262 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. temper and .a caressing address. It is curious, and a little vexatious to find how matter and manner are con founded ; how so many honeyed words from a plausible, crafty woman, and so many sharp ones from a true and tender one, are carelessly allowed to reverse the world's estimation of their character, and are received even by those who ought to know better, as correct indices of the individuals. The sweetness of manner is so notorious a varnish, as to become the butt of the corroding acids and scraping knives of many of our writers of fiction. Nowhere is it more extensively displayed than in the inordinate love of children and children's society affected by some of the women of our day ; and in the exaggerated estima tion of childish worth displayed largely in some depart ments of the world of letters. Because our Master taught us to reverence little children by reminding us that their helplessness and ignorance of fraud and violence, rendered them, and all who are like them, especially the charge of His Father's angels, one-half of the world professes to regard these little people as angels outright. This extravagance has even been pushed, in the face of a thousand examples of childish meanness and tyranny, to the daring extent of a denial of original sin. It strikes me that this foolish notion of which men and women are so proud is but a rag oi spurious humility, for you see it is actually easier for your arrogance and headiness, your sloth and obstinacy, your desperate covetousness and turbulence to bow, half sceptically, half laughingly, to a child's sceptre of"], [277, "Kindliness. 263 rushes, than to pay a modest and womanly homage to a man's truncheon. Kindliness, then, never consisted or even lay to any extent in ' becks and bows, and wreathed smiles,' though real pleasantness is a great element in winning the favour of our fellows. Neither is it by any means en- grossed or fully expressed by almsdeeds, though without question, if we do feel tenderly to our neighbour at all, we feel with peculiar tenderness to our neighbour in any suffering and wretchedness which we can comprehend. ' Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and have not charity, I am nothing.' This kindliness is charity, liberality and generosity of spirit, fairness and impartia- lity of judgment, mildness and meekness of heart rather than of tone, kindly affectionateness in all ties and re- lations \u2014 tenderest in the nearest, mellow and sympathetic in the most removed. It is of the very essence of Christianity, and the neglect of it has inflicted more in jury on the cause of Him who is love divine, has wounded him more sorely in the house of his friends than the absence of any other quality or faculty whatever. I would urge it the more imperatively that it is (but cer tainly by no means to the same extent as formerly) overlooked, or understated, or in some respect slurred over in many lessons for young people. Kindliness is only second to godliness. On one occasion the apostle accorded it the precedence : ' If we do not love the brother whom we have seen, how can we love him,' in whose glorious image that brother was originally created, the ' God whom we have not seen?'"], [278, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 264 On woman, by natural constitution and time-out-of mind institutions, kindliness is so imperative, that the want of it brings down express scandal on godly women, or rather on women professing godliness. I need not allude to the satires, deserved and undeserved, by some of the strangely neutral, some of the still more strangely and sadly antagonistic, and some of the merely smart and pungent writers of the day. This defect is generally seen where our very instincts should have pointed out to us the flagrant outrage, by our own hearths, and in our own homes. Domestic duties, always holy and dear, are often monotonous \u2014 have often their wearing irritations and carking cares ; they are unseasoned by excitement ; they claim no renown. The self-sacrifice they involve, although it is often very complete, is so subtle, that it becomes no cause of pride ; in fact, it is made almost inadvertently and insensibly. Therefore stragglers and adventurers are won from these still, shady, simple paths by vanity, by the restlessness of craving, unemployed energies, and also (to do them justice) by a mistaken sense of duty. To enter upon public services, they desert their private posts, and they are thus guilty of a double infidelity; they have for saken their first love, and by taking upon them engage ments for which they were not free, they have also done despite to and brought shame upon what was in itself fair and honourable, pure and lovely, and of good re port. This evil is so very grave, that it needs the strongest protest against its existence and recurrence. But, on the other hand, to those who are disposed to"], [279, "Kindliness. 265 insist on ' busy-bodies, ' showy professors,' ' ill-ordered, ill-balanced enthusiasts,' we would state respectfully and good-humouredly that it is the scum and froth of the pot which rises to the surface ; that the sound hearts and true, the deep hearts and tender, the sensible, practical women, the cheery, patient women, the con stant, untiring, unassuming asserters and maintainers of righteousness and love, work everywhere unseen, unheard of, until the day shall declare it. And our generation has proved sufficiently that great deeds of mercy can be done by women, whose household names have never been spoken without a blessing. Kindliness is thoroughly opposed to meanness, to malice, to mischief of every description. It bids us have faith in one another ; it bids us bear long with one another ; it tells us to be obedient, respectful, and ten der to our elders; firm and yet indulgent to our juniors; reasonable and gracious to our equals ; just, thought ful, feeling, and helpful to our inferiors. It negatives mere human ambition and selfish rivalry ; it altogether forbids slander, talebearing, and backbiting ; it even cries oh, fie, fie ! against ridicule, when ridicule verges on levity and cynicism. Our Bible has at least this superiority over the Hebrew Talmud, that we have the one in a moderate compass, so that we can all read it from end to end, without any stretch of application, every year of our lives, if we choose; while the other consists of such a mass of writing, and host of saws, that a youth's entire education is spent in becoming 'ready at the law.'

Well it was for the uncalculating inmates, that the plants deodorized faithfully, and with out making any fuss about it. The human plants could have stood more than a breath or two of the keen, cutting air ; did encounter it freely to go to Sunday sermons and prayers, to the weekly ball, to visiting, shopping, and marketing ; but their nurslings, the bower of Italian flowers, would have withered under the cold touch of the ice-king's fingers. There was a stove in the room, keeping up its heat to the temperature of a comfortable oven. A man was standing playing on a piano ; in short, it was Germany, and not Eng land. ' If little Peter gets up the hymn for Christmas, I '11 give him a Niirnberg egg off the tree ; we 're northern birds, but we can furnish such eggs once upon a time,' said the musician, in a loud, rich, joyous voice, address ing a girl who entered the room, and sat down in the bower in the window. Before I give the girl's answer, I should like to in troduce the father and daughter to you. He was Hen Wilhelm K\u0153nig, general merchant in the northern town of Schneehaufen. He was not an idealized German ; he was big, sanguine (with a wreath of ruddy-brown hair round his mouth and down to his throat), hilarious, hearty; I daresay he could be determined when he liked, but he was mostly jovial,\u2014 the prince of good fellows,\u2014with curls, scarcely tinged with grey, clustering"], [282, "Papers for Thoughts il Girls. 268 round his very square forehead, and with square white teeth, which he was perpetually showing. He was an ardent, vivacious fellow, with a quick perception of the ludicrous ; he was tolerably vain, he thought nobody had improved his musical education (on which he set more store than on his trade and custom) as he had done on small advantages ; he had a high estimation of his own overtures, and sometimes decried other people's quite openly. It may give you the most correct idea of Herr Kcenig to inform you that he was called in Schneehaufen Willy Kcenig (only that they pronounced the diminutive Villee), just as he would have been here. Great slashing, dashing, laughing Willy K\u0153nig ! He was counted very stunning in musical performances, at military marches and mazurkas, and anything requiring fire and brilliance ; but it was a characteristic feature of Herr Willy that his own private impression was, that his forte lay in masses, just as Sir Joshua always imagined himself a faithful disciple of Michael Angelo. I have taken it into my head that you will begin by undervaluing Herr Willy, and that you would take less and less to him if you ever got a glimpse of him playing at games and dancing the cotillon ; but I have a kind ness for him when I think how poor he was, and yet how light-hearted, how reverent in his own continental fashion, how patient he was with his cross wife, and how kind to his ten children. Really, he had little comfort in any of them, except in that dreamy, delicate Bertha ; but he was as fond of them as Bess of her litter of pup pies, and what pleasure they can be to Bess she only"], [283, "Kindliness. 269 knows. Herr Kcenig's were not bad children positively ; but life had been such a scramble to them, they had been so pushed out in the world, and knocked about ere any of the ten reached his or her tenth year, that they very soon began to look after themselves, and took individual twists, and were anything but pliant and graceful. Happily they were hardy, which was of more importance ; but little Albrecht in the toy-shop, and Hans in the druggist's, and Fritz with his uncle at the farm, were far too much engrossed with their toys, drugs, cattle and sheep, and their play, when they had a moment's liberty, to have any sympathy or attention to spare for their father, They only went to him in their scrapes, and, on far fewer occasions, in their successes. Even little Peter, the musician, did not seek to have much companionship with his father, beyond the neces sary instruction from him. Was not Peter himself already in the choir ; and a miniature bugler in the Schneehaufen band ; and was he not afready eagerly counting his pay, and anticipating his flight as a true German travelling-apprentice, to pass in succes sion through the great music-houses of Leipsic, Berlin, Vienna 1 The same was the case with the girls ; Thekla and Elise in a worsted shop ; Agatha assisting her aunt in the great inn of Schneehaufen, the inn with the sign of the three golden crowns, borrowed ri-om Rheinland and Cologne ; even baby Rica was more engrossed with her anxiety about her milk-sops and her sugar-balls, than her father's kisses. Am I describing a very selfish family ? Only little hearts that"], [284, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 270 had too soon had their bloom rubbed off them ; little hands too soon taught to wield the tools of labour in dependently of their parents. The brood had love for each other, but they were so busy they were only able to bring it forth on great occasions. Madam Kcenig was also not a bad woman. Herr K\u0153nig was persuaded, correctly, that she had been a good wife to him ; but she was dreadfully worried and she was dreadfully cross. She could not altogether help it, I conclude, for she was a little woman, with the deli cacy of constitution which Bertha had inherited ; and the superhuman energy which was required to overcome her weakness, and do her duty to her numerous de scendants was likely to engender acidity. A needle will prick you and draw blood, as well as sew up your seams. Madam Kcenig was like a needle, sharp, clear, keen ; her little figure is meagre, her once fair complexion is grey ; her blue eyes, sapphire eyes originally, are steel-blue eyes now. Yes, Herr Kcenig met with little indulgence in his own household, save from Bertha, and Bertha held little communication beyond commands, requests, and gossip, with any member of the family except her father. Altogether, the Kcenigs' was not a relaxing home. It was too bracing, for that matter, dangerous for stinting and blighting all the flowers of fancy and feeling, spar ing only those material flowers in the bower in the family room. Bertha K\u0153nig was an idealized German ; she was not one of those stout little German girls whom we see"], [285, "Kindliness. 271 so often and shake hands with so freely ; who bake and sew, and dance and chatter fearlessly with the very coffee-sisters, and are in their element in the tea-gardens. She was what grows up at their side, a waxen-natured girl, like her own balsams, delicate, refined, but abstracted, and, to a certain extent, impractical, \u2014 what Caroline Perthes was in her maiden days. Bertha was intellec tual, and happily for herself, she had not confined herself to Goethe and Schiller. Klopstock and the old German hymns had moved her inmost spirit. Such a nature was sadly out of keeping in the Kcenigs' house, yet it was developed there, and though it pined, no great violence had wounded or slain it. Madam Kcenig took care of that Bertha was the delicate child, and notwithstanding her mother thought her far too fanciful for this world, and too studious for a woman, and sadly indifferent and languid for one who should one day aspire to be an expert housekeeper, she was too good a mother to do more than speak sharply to Bertha herself, and rout every one else who inter fered with her. I cannot say that there was any likeness between Bertha and Herr Kcenig. He was the impersonation of a brave sensuous nature. She dwelt in the spirit world very much apart from life, the earth and its con cerns, both enjoyments and pains. But Herr K\u0153nig, though a hard-working man, had the most leisure in the family, and he was infinitely better-humoured than Madam K\u0153nig; so Bertha and Herr K\u0153nig drew together."], [286, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 272 It must be mentioned here that Bertha's great wish at this time \u2014 and it amounted almost to a passion with the girl \u2014 was to go and stay for a season with her uncle, Pastor Miiller, in one of the great towns. Bertha had once visited him for a day, and that glimpse had been enough. He was a liberal, poetic, and pious theologian, such as Germany to her honour often rears, with kindred wife, kindred children, and kindred friends ; \u2014 the very house breathing an atmosphere of noble thought, playful fancy, and generous, constant benevolence ! Her cou sin Rudolph, the holder of the prize-medal of his town, the author of verses which Bertha never said to her self in the moonlight alone in the girls' room, when the other girls were singing and talking and entertain ing their companions down stairs, without trembling and crying in an ecstasy of admiration, \u2014 how Bertha would like to see and know her cousin Rudolph ! the blush rose-colour came to her cheek at the mere thought of it. Her cousin Hedwig, who was first pupil at the Conservatoire, and had played to the Princess, and caused Bertha's father to pull his beard and go off into extravagances whenever he spoke of her ! \u2014 if Herr Willy could have been jealous, it would have been on account of a daughter like Hedwig Miiller to perform his marches and mazurkas, and inspire his long coming masses. Little Peter was all very well; he had a fine sense of tune, and if he proved diligent and obedient might make something of the cornet or the violoncello ; but he would never play the piano like Hedwig Miiller. Hedwig Miiller was inspired with the"], [287, "Kindliness. 273 very soul of harmony ; and what would not her cousin Bertha give to be submitted to the charm of her art, to be swayed like the pine-branches by the wind, to yield up her haunting melancholy, like the gloom of King Saul under the harping of the harper David ? Then how good all the Muilers were, how they thought for others, planned for others, worked for others ! No wretched slavery to the means of living, no engrossing interest in the disposal of such limited profits as those gained by Herr K\u0153nig, no grasping at every advantage, and haggling over the expenditure of every penny. When there were to be relaxation and gratification, the K\u0153nigs selected the most worldly and selfish kinds ; the shooting-gallery for the boys, the ribbons to trim afresh the girls' old gowns \u2014 the whole generally culminating in the Wednesday's ball, or the sports, and the promenade to the Schneehaufen-band of a Sunday afternoon. Bertha longed to see all this reversed. There had been some overtures made by the Muilers to have their retiring, sensitive cousin Bertha with them for Christmas or Easter ; and on the decision of those proposals Bertha hung as on a question of life and death. But it was still two months to Christmas, and it was an instance of Herr K\u0153nig's forward sanguine ness that he was already disposing of gifts from the tree; and such a plump, substantial gift as a Niirnberg egg or watch ! Bertha could not tell how her father would fulfil his promise. I am afraid Herr Willy promised some \\imes without the action following the words. Well,"], [288, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 274 the intention was the next best thing to the perform ance. With Christmas two months before them, and Herr Willy's intention altogether problematical, out and out impossible, if it reached Madam Kcenig's ears, Bertha yet opposed it, and raised her voice in protest ; not loudly or disrespectfully, for Bertha was gentle to a de gree, and if her eyes were open to the stolidity and shallowness of others, they were doubly open to her own weakness, and lamentable shortcomings and blun ders. But she lifted the cudgels like a good little pure minded, high-hearted, scrupulous knight-errant, a Red- Cross Knight it must have been, like him who rode forth on the first day's adventures from the fairy queen's footstool. ' Father, is it not bribing Peter to do his duty thus to hire him to application, in a hymn too, by a glittering toy ofa watch ?' ' What would you have, my daughter ?' answered Herr K\u0153nig with animation, but without irritation ; he was passionate at times, never peevish. ' The little fellow must have his reward. Industry has its reward. Did you never study that fine maxim, Bertha?' 'It is a beggarly maxim, father, in so far as it answers to the jingle of coin, the glitter of jewels, or the rank of a court place,' responded Bertha, firing up. ' What do you expect him to be but covetous, envious, perhaps dishonest, if you teach him that, for a certain amount of exertion and submission, it is his right to get"], [289, "Kindliness. 275 a certain worldly prize, a watch, or a gun, or even a holiday in the forest ?' Herr K\u0153nig uttered in German an exclamation equi valent to ' bosh ! ' and continued, vehemently, though still in the most perfect good-humour, \u2014 ' The boy must have a reward to encourage him to perseverance ; he is not fit to understand any reward but such as I offer; when he is older he may distinguish between honour and gain, between what is moral and what is material. I leave that time to take care of itself.' ' But, father, is this training Peter to be an evangelist, a saint, a martyr ? ' ' Bless the child ! I don't presume to want Peter to be an evangelist, or saint, or martyr, unless as the good Lord will have him so. I want him to be a good citizen; I can aid him so far, and that is my business ;' and Herr K\u0153ning stamped out of the room, but still not in dud geon, rather relishing an argument with Bertha. What was play to him was, if not death, at least great pain to Bertha. Why should they all be so prosaic, their minds and hearts so much of the earth, earthy ? And why should they spoil Peter, or any young boy, by offering a bait to greediness, a trap to entice him into low ambition ? Bertha let her knitting fall, and sat musing sadly. If she had the ruling of youn^ people, at least all their aims should be pure, their prizes such as became immortals. Bertha, with her white pale skin, her light golden hair, her blue eyes raised, and her gaze, floating as it were after an unseen kingdom,"], [290, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 276 her hands locked as we see them on the bosoms of stone effigies, and pointing heavenward, looked a very white dove of innocence and spiritual longing. And had this Bertha no idol in the background of her heart, no covetousness blending with and marring her purity ? Was Bertha good solely for goodness' sake, and could it be said of her, that in all her aspirations, strivings, sacrifices, there was no ulterior motive, that her lest hand held no bribe to lure her right to duty, that she was altogether an Israelite without guile \\ Let us dwell with Bertha for one or two days, and we shall see. The next morning Bertha awoke early, and as she lay pondering vaguely beneath her eider-down quilt, the clock struck, and with its noise aroused Bertha to the fact that there was no stir in the next room occupied by her two brothers, who still attended the gymnasium in the mornings ; that they had slept too long ; that they would rise and run away in too great a hurry to go out to the pump and wash, a process of which the sluggish lads were not fond in these October mornings when they had to break the ice from the cistern, and the icy waters caused their round red cheeks to smart and tingle. But Madam K\u0153nig was as cleanly as a Dutch woman, and would suffer no neglect, no slurring over of ablutions ; and she who was everywhere in these morn ing hours, with her eyes darting into every corner, as the maid Jetta, in her coarse stuff petticoat and jacket, and wooden clogs, knew right well, \u2014 she would discover the base infringement of family rules and failures in binding ceremonies. She would even send and fetch the boys"], [291, "Kindliness. 277 out of the gymnasium ; she would summon Herr K\u0153nig from his stores, and, putting in his hands a literal ashen stave, she would demand of him the execution of justice upon the criminals, the infliction of the heavy penalty which should save the lads from degenerating into vagabonds. Well, what of it ? It was no business of Bertha's. She had no greater predilection for the slippery court yard, and the iced cistern, and the primitive mode of washing for the boys of the house, than the boys them selves. If she awoke the boys, and urged them to rise and do their duty, they would be impatient and rude to her ; they would give her no thanks, but treat her as a spy and an interloper. Bertha turned to the wall. But then there danced before her Pastor Midler's house, its loving deeds and life of generous self-sacrifice. How would she be fit for it if she could not even conquer her laziness to aid her brothers ? She would become fit for it ; she would prepare herself, and then, to be sure, the ability would be given her to go and sojourn in the city. She sprang out of bed, dressed quickly, and went to Albrecht and Hans' room, and approached their cribs. The boys slept like logs, and were as sulky as bears at being disturbed. ' It is you, you White Mouse,' called Albrecht. ' What are you doing there ? Can't you lie still, Leonora, until the Spectre Knight fetches you ?' muttered Hans It was a family joke with the Kcenigs to call Bertha Leonora, and argue that her meditative habits were the"], [292, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 278 result of an excess of mourning for a knight slain in the Thirty Years' War. But Bertha thought of the Muilers and persevered, and at last she got her brothers up and out to the court, and stood in the doorway watching them. 'You had better come and break the ice, Bertha, since you are so forward,' shouted Albrecht, ruefully, standing without his coat, in his matted hair, winking his eyes, and dabbling with a thick finger at the white flakes in the cistern. Bertha shivered, but what a fine occasion for practising self-denial. ' Get along, Albrecht,' protested Hans ; ' you '11 give Bertha the ague.' After that Bertha thought it was rather pretty and amusing to see her rough, hardy brothers shattering the ice, thrusting in their arms and heads at one bold plunge, coming out blowing and purple, and all the time the rising winter sun, silvery white as the moon, striking upon them without dazzling them. Bertha was so animated that she ran in, poured out the coffee, cut the black bread, and filled the boys' bags with the books for the gymnasium, all with her own hands. ' Thanks to you, Whitemouse ; we see white mice can look alive when they like.' Brothers are not the most complimentary recipients of bounties ; but Bertha's heart felt warmed, and two or three times during the day's knitting she thought of the morning scene in the court-yard, and smiled and coupled it with the far-away Muilers, and felt almost certain that"], [293, "Kindliness. 279 she would go to her uncle's in the cultivated, intellectual, philanthropic city. Bertha was livelier than usual, and more inclined to act than to devote every stolen moment to reading, and conning over mentally what she had read. She reflected that if the Muilers were here, they would go in such hard weather, and ask poor old Beata how her stack of wood keeps up, and perhaps read a favourite hymn to her from her song-book. Bertha watched for a favourable moment, and obtained permis sion from her mother without more than, ' You want to lay yourself up again, child, and to have me running up and down to nurse you, as if my poor bones did not ache enough already?' To do Bertha justice, she did not think going half way down the street and inquiring for Beata, and perhaps sitting five minutes on the stool before her stove, was anything very meritorious. Beata was a dependant of the Kcenigs. A family must be very poor, or very hard, if it does not number one dependant. What ! worse than Dives ; not so much as a Lazarus at the gate ; not so much as crumbs to fling to him from a better supplied table ! Beata, in her better days, had assisted to wash and clean for the K\u0153nigs ; now she was bed-ridden ; but she was not in any of those abysses of destitution which we see out of Germany. She had been saving; she Aad able and willing kinsmen, who helped her ; and a very little in the cheap country sufficed to keep Beata tolerably comfortable on her bed. She was a patient old woman, and fond of old acquaintances like the"], [294, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 280 K\u0153nigs, particulaily Bertha, who had been a white dove to the hard-favoured, hard-working, coarsely sur rounded old woman. In her fur cloak, and with her fur shoes and her warm hood, Bertha did not feel the piercing cold any more than in a sharp tingling, which was not unpleasant to the youthful though somewhat feeble flow of her blood. And how beautiful the streets were under a recently frozen fall of snow, for the snow comes in Northern Ger many before the end of October. Bertha did not wonder that her sisters, who were strong, ran out and played at ball with her brothers in their half-hours after dinner and coffee, and even loitered and romped on their return beneath the stars of heaven, and with their own yellow, smoky stars of earth, the horn lanterns. It was little Rica's play-ground ; think of the hardiness of such a nursery ! Actually the little girl, with bare, blue mottled arms and bare blonde head, was shrieking with delight as she scraped the snow from the door step with her little shovel. Bertha liked their street at all times ; admired it of a summer night, when the tender linden-trees among the houses were shaking out their heart-shaped leaves ; when each family of the township sat on the benches before the doors smoking, singing, working, drinking beer out of cans, or sour wine out of tall red or blue glasses ; when the procession of the cows came in from the meadows, headed by the queen with her bells, and each cow dropped off with a long mellow low, like a ship firing a signal-gun before she casts anchor, in her own"], [295, "Kindliness. 281 cow-house ; and then when the buxom young men and women turned out in the centre of the street and played at games, no way removed from ' Catch me if you can,' and ' In my castle,' and ' I spy,' as they did in London in the time of Old Stowe. But, if anything, Bertha pre ferred the street in winter as it was, after she had chatted to Beata, and slid down her few groschen, and read her a loving, trusting old people's hymn out of her song book, \u2014 when she returned with the setting sun flooding with rose-colour the spire of the church, the churchyard with its crosses, and the roofs of the houses ; the rosy-red blushing over the dead, white background. \u2022 Bertha had only once seen Schneehaufen more beautiful, and then it was with the awful beauty of fire, when a score of the wooden houses crackled and blazed and crashed in glowing ruins, lighting up the excited faces, the wide sky, and the whole expanse of snowy country far and near. The next day was a great day in the K\u0153nigs' house. I daresay you will laugh, and I will let you, when I tell you why. But for all your scornful titter, it was a brave, jovial day, and I have read a lyric of Uhland's, joyous, graphic, sensuous, if you will, but still most ringing, un daunted, anJ thankful, which he wrote to celebrate it ; the swine-killing day in die German household. The poor swine, which ate the K\u0153nigs' husks, was sacrificed at an early hour of the morning, awakening the neigh bours with its dying groans, making them move their heads quickly on their pillows, and murmur, enviously, ' Ah 1 the K\u0153nigs' swine i what full barrels they will u"], [296, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 282 have to-day ! What roasts, and frys, and pork-pies ' what sausages, what cracknels ! There are so many of them, that they will not have a bit to spare to anybody besides themselves.' It had been scalded and scraped, at least undergone processes equivalent to scalding and scraping, betimes, so that by breakfast it was ready for the great process of cutting up and laying down in brine, salt as the ocean. There it lay on a long board, stretched out, not unlike a dead gladiator, while Herr Willy himself was, for that morning, engaged at home on business of importance, unavoidably detained from his store, his weights and measures. No Schneehaufen customer would be so inconsiderate as to enter Herr K\u0153nig's store-house, expecting to see the principal about Dantzic flour or Breslau cloth, on his swine killing day. Herr Willy stood over the swine with a cleaver, prepared, as the head of the family, to assume the weighty office of breaking up and blocking out the carcase in presence of as many interested, competent witnesses as could congregate around him, and behold, with pride and elation, the solemn rite. For one other day, besides Christmas-day, there was a great central bond of union in the K\u0153nig family. What was its weight? How many pounds of suet had it yielded? How many hams would be strung and hung ? Would the mother be able to bake out of its riches that very night for supper ? Each eager aspirant rushed in from school and shop with such inquiries and walked round and round the dead gladiator (I protest it was rather unfeeling of them), down to Rica, who was shaking"], [297, "Kindliness. 283 the poor limp trotters and clamouring for butter -brod. You may not see the point of the demand, but the economic Germans have three sorts of butter-brod \u2014 pre pared from butter proper, from hog's lard for children, and from \u2014 oh, strong unctuous substitute ! \u2014 green goose-fat. I must say I cannot altogether sympathize with Bertha in her indifference, approaching to dislike, to the spectacle. I am not so mealy-mouthed. I think there was something in it not at all wire-drawn, but genuinely Saxon and hearty, though it partook of the animal no doubt. What of that? We are animals as long as we remain in the body, are we not? Only let us be honest animals, like the butcher's dog, and not over head-strong animals like that worthy either, but animals and immortals as well. I dread your false sen sibility ; I dread it as apt to be but a whited sepulchre, hiding dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Herr Willy looked manly and handsome as he bran dished his shining weapon, and prepared to make in cisions with the skill of an anatomist.

Still, Bertha hung back, and was reluctant to offer any assistance. What ! smear her white fingers with hideous stains, handle these blocks of flesh and fat, and bare, blue-white, exposed bone ; she would rather go with the dough to the oven. Still, her mother wanted her now if she ever wanted her at home. Much as Thekla and Elise would have liked to have stayed to assist, they could not absent themselves from their worsted shop. Agatha could not be spared by her aunt, for the court-chamberlain had arrived over-night, and there was enough stir in Schneehaufen without the kill ing of the K\u0153nigs' swine to add to it : but as coffee sister Korner said, ' People would make a noise in the world by conducting their business at improper times, if you were soft enough to permit it Witness the Frau Chorister's son, bom on Easter morning, just as the Herr Chorister should have been lustily raising the Easter hymn, in which he quavered like a cat, and all but broke down ; yes, all but broke down.' For Jetta, the servant, the true German peasant, uncouth, cum brous, with her doltish, unstimulated, untrained powers, \u2014 no one dreamt of confiding any part of this distin guished charge to her, no one expected anything from her but true slavish toil. Madam K\u0153nig would have liked to have done it all herself; she was a generalissimo of a little woman, who would have fought her own bat tles without soldiers, if that had been admissible ; but Bertha saw, by the contraction of the pupils of the eyes,"], [299, "Kindliness. 285 and the red spots on the thin cheeks, that her mother had one of her terrible headaches. It was barbarous in Bertha not to interpose, though she should hear the waspish 'geh fort,' equivalent to the English 'get along, do,' in return for her reluctant advances. Yes, she thought again of the noble, loving Muilers, and pushed into the arena. ' You can't, you won't,' her mother interposed, but the words came faintly. After all, Bertha had no great difficulty in assuming her post, and keeping her position ; and after the first shuddering attempt it was not a bad business, not a bit of it. She rather liked it after she had got accus tomed to it, patting the blocks, and packing them dexterously (as all art -natures are dexterous when they condescend to a world - wide vocation) to the sound of her father's triumphant bravos, and to the light of her mother's half- swooning, but ever-vigilant eyes. For me, I like to see Bertha there. She seems to me like the vine-leaves, a link between the real and the ideal, the sensuous and the moral. And her heart did warm unspeakably, just as I said it did after the wash ing of the boys ; and she whispered to herself, ' I shall go to the Muilers, I feel certain of it ; and I think I shall grow worthy of them.' You may say that you cannot see what good Bertha's superiority did to her, if it only induced her to scorn common people and common things, and I agree with you entirely. I echo, Cut bono ? As amazed and sor rowful as you can be, I declare it is not a strong, pure"], [300, "286 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. good, that is thus lofty and fastidious, though I fancy it is often enough found in high-minded persons, particu larly in their nonage, and I think for them is written in one sense the apostle's recommendation, ' Condescend to men of low estate.' It was now All-Saints Eve, and fortunately for Bertha, before she had compromised herself, as she was in the habit of doing by gliding about or standing motion less, a mere ghost or statue among the others, exciting in turn their pity, their contempt, or their wrath, the remembrance forced itself upon her, that Hedwig Miil ler had once been with them on this festival night She recollected that she had been startled to find Hed wig thoroughly interested and exceedingly friendly with every member of the party, not only affording them music, but entering into their follies one after another. And when she had asked curiously the cause of this contentment, Hedwig answered with a rare smile, ' Littie Bertha, it is the motto in our house to make people as happy as they can be in their own way, unless that be a wicked way ; and, when you grow bigger and older, you will find their way is not so very far behind our way. My dear, there is a great deal that is trifling and mechanical, selfish and base, in high art and bene volence, and, sometimes, alas ! in our very worship, as long as we are in this world. These old traditions. wid the many folk who have practised them, come home to me with a throng of associations ; so does the plucking of the petals of the corn-flower, and its doggrel."], [301, "Kindliness. 287 ' Im Herzen, Mit Schmerzen,: and so on it goes. I am about to play it out to you, little Bertha, in a piece on the piano, and see if it will not speak to you, and see if you will not listen to its voice.' Pledwig Midler's words came rushing back to Bertha, as she stood playing with her gloves. You know her head was full of the Muilers at this time, and their sentences returned upon her memory clear and full and pat to the subjects which they had commemorated. She was glad that she had recalled them in time, for she would have been sorry if they had revived in her mind, and reproached her when All -Saints Eve party was over. It was not of very much moment to the others, probably ; but she would try, at least, to be companionable. That night, she was surprised to discover of how much moment it was ; how much a disengaged obliging person is always in request ; how she could protect the man with the lead ; how her sug gestions that the solid cakes and silvery feathers in the water indicated merchants' bales in the city, and trees in the backwoods, were received with rounds of acclama tion, after the preceding stereotyped visions. It ended with Rica \u2014 who, on ordinary occasions, was fonder of being with her bouncing brothers and sisters, though they shook her off, or made game of her, or boxed her ears, than with soft, careless Bertha \u2014 now clasping Bertha's hand, standing on tiptoe, and, in a childish )vay, begging her to read her little fortune, with an"], [302, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 288 importunity and single-heartedness and bold lovingness which went to Bertha's heart, thrilled her, and nearly provoked her to commit the enormity of kissing the child passionately, with tears swimming in her eyes.

' Don't you think Bertha is like an angel to-night ?' ' An angel, humph ! a pale girl, with blonde hair not half plaited. I wish she would take a lesson from Thekla ; you cannot know Thekla's braid from a plaited ribbon, and no thanks to her for it, when she took the whole afternoon since she left the shop to do it, and left me to burn my face preparing the coffee, and taking the biscuits out of the oven.

She thought less of the Musters to-night, less of Rudolph's poetry, and Hedwig's music, and the whole house's reverence and beneficence ; she thought more of being good and doing good, proving a blessing on every day, on swine -killing day, and amidst the gambols of All- Hallow Eve \u2014 in what must, after all, be her abiding place, home.

We will be obliged to keep you ourselves for the Christmas-tree, and the Niirnberg eggs, and St. Sylvester's night, and the cotillons ; you won't be sorry for that, my Bertha ?' Herr Willy could not think of a kinder way of putting the disappointment ; and when, darting a cursory glance at Bertha's face, he saw no shower, and no storm, he fan cied, simple man, that no harm had been done, because in that original household, among those independent children, he was accustomed to furious sobbings and scoldings. Did you ever feel as if you had got wings somehow. and were flying easily and divinely above the world, when all at once the machinery failed, and you came down with a cruel thump in the mire or the dust-heap ? Bertha had this sensation. She was at once stunned into an outward stoniness, and inwardly probed to the quick She saw how much she had been bent on going to Pas tor Miiller' s, she felt all that the hope had been to her ; and it seemed hard to her that it should not be. She had been so good lately, she had been so willing to pre pare herself for the privilege, so sure of being benefited by it, she had been so happy in the expectation, so happy and so good, only last night, that the bitter cross of this morning sounded like a taunting reproach uttered against her and her vows. Her sisters were not thus baulked ; they had their sledging parties, their dances ; her bro thers had their schools, and businesses, and boyish ex ploits; she alone was to be thus beaten and starved, and that because she desired better -wid loftier things.

Was not the very opportunity of growing wise and saintly denied her ? And she must go back to the dusty, beaten track, to the rough, coarse brothers and sisters, the sour mother, the light-hearted father. No listening to Cousin Rudolph's poetry now, no hearkening to Cousin Hed wig's music, no initiating, by Pastor Miiller himself, into exercises of charity and mercy. Bertha's family had their delights in lavish abundance. What had Bertha ? Nothing, save the flowers, the winter landscape, her books and prayers, her struggles after a higher life destined to perish, doomed to prove her bane. Forgive poor Bertha, for she was mad, as we all are when we rebel ; mad and ungrateful, leaving out many counts in her reckoning, \u2014 her God and Lord, his oeau tiful world here, his glorious heaven hereafter ; her kindred, faithful though uncongenial ; her poet friends, whom she knew in spirit, whom she would know in another and a truer day, even as she was known ; her faculties of body and soul.

Then her father spoke to her in his waggish, roguish way, standing, as he had done one day before, striking chords on the piano \u2014 ' Peter is getting on with his choral hymn ; I must find him that Niirnberg egg.' Bertha put her hand to her head ; why did she feel as if she had received another blow, a blow, however. rather rousing and quickening this time ? Oh, self deluded soul, what had she wanted but a Niirnberg egg for her duty ! Her father had been honest and hardy, and, by comparison, harmless in his bribe, while she had been double-dealing and subtle in her bargain ; she had required the Musters and the city for her re ward ; she had named her payment, and demanded it, dollar and groschen. Soon she would have been ask ing heaven for her wages. Bertha was very penitent, but she was comforted too, poor soul, for her loss ; she thought tenderly and tearfully of the vision of Schiller, whom people call unconsciously Christian in his chivalry and in his paganism. She thought of the poet's plea to Jove, when king and trader, husbandman and abbot, had forestalled him, and robbed him of land and sea, bread and wine. Great Jove gave nothing back, only, in atonement, he granted one grace to the poor son of the muses.

FASHION. '\"THE customs of society in Christian countries, if not altogether just and good, are generally moderately commendable. Communities, even in heathen times, seem to have been endowed with the faculty of deciding, candidly and creditably enough for the masses, if they could only have adhered to their decisions. Therefore, to act in violent contradiction to established laws and precedents, to set at defiance the fashion alike of time ana place, is not, unless in a case of strict necessity, a wise, far less a modest proceeding. It is particularly senseless and aggravating in women whose power, like that of the old Roman tribunes, is that of quiet, steady vetos. But the sinners in this respect are comparatively few and far between ; and they are those to whom arguments on moderation, the relative importance and non-importance of great things and small, the advantage of open-hearted concessions and good-tempered submis sions, would mostly savour of lukewarmness. On the contrary, the stumblers from the offence of fashion are legion. The amount of activity misdirected, time and means"], [309, "Fashion. 295 wasted, tempers spoiled, and sources of usefulness lost by fashion, is so enormous, that it would be ludicrous, if it were not lamentable. Remember, I do not refer to women of high rank, whose responsibilities are on an exaggerated scale, but to the women of the middle class, who are bond-slaves to this shifting, intangible, potent system and power. So wedded are they to the bond age, that there is not a point on which the writer has approached the reader with such a hopelessness akin to despair \u2014 only Christians have no warrant to despair. To name the degree of absurdity and error to which fashion carries the women who are not steeled against it in every light, would fill not a paper but a volume. And, with regard to the women of the middle rank. there is one light in which fashion seizes them with an engrossing supremacy which it does not affect in the case of women of wealth and station. It robs my lady flagrantly of her money, and incidentally of her tealth and peace ; but, from my plain though pre tentious mistress it pilfers in addition, without scruple, both her time and her talents. The hours she spends in contriving ; the cleverness she unfolds in bringing to bear; the fortitude she evinces in enduring counter checks ; the self-denial ; the toil she undertakes for such a wearing out, fickle, ungrateful idol, would be incredible, were it not proved by a multitude of cases every day. The labour of a working man, a slave, a pack-horse, is not greater, by comparison, than the groaning efforts, the address, the stoicism of a poor woman running after"], [310, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 296 fashion, keeping up appearances, or rather deluding her self and her neighbours into believing herself a fine lady, and her family a dashing, luxurious household. Luxurious household indeed ! they are as far from attain ing to this as they are from possessing the dignity, repose, honest hospitality, and loyal brotherly-kindliness which were originally within their reach. I am anxious to state, that in these remarks I do not at all refer to the womanly desire to have all things at home, furniture and apparel, nice and pleasant ; to the sense of the beautiful and the graceful, which cultivation supplies ; to the tender pains, the genial, joint efforts by which family-life is unspeakably gladdened and bright ened ; to the trouble and energy by which a frugal mother has her children respectable, neat, smart. No, no ; these are the sweet blossomings over of truth, affection, self-respect, and faithful regard for kindred. What I inveigh against is the senseless waste, the taste less, vain show, the pinching behind backs, and the profusion before faces, which has no husband's comfort, no child's happiness, no brother's or sister's enjoyment as its object, \u2014 whose beginning and end are in pride and vanity, and whose fruit is unneighbourly strife in the race of extravagance and rain. Even when there is a little sense to hold back in time from this common con clusion, such lives are fertile in falsehood, deceit, un lovely calculations and speculations, and barren in all nobleness, gentleness, and generosity. In the case of girls, the stumbling-block of fashion scarcely extends yet to having houses like the squire's,"], [311, "Fashion. 297 if not the lord duke's, or to dispensing dinners like the Lord Mayor's feasts, or, more properly, like the so-called recherche banquets where every dish has a French name, and much stress is put on the entremets, and the bouquet of the wines, such as we read of in fashionab'.e novels. What principally concerns girls is fashion in dress, and in spending their time, especially the early portion of their day, which is peculiarly their own. Dress might have a long homily, and yet a few sen tences may sum it up. Much must be left to individual circumstances and tastes. Dress within your means, handsomely if you will, becomingly if you can. Dress affectionately (I cannot think of a recommendation which can render dress more productive of real, per manent pleasure), to gratify papa and mamma \u2014 with a lingering adhesion to some rather worn-out, rather ex ploded article of attire, because it was Mary's or Willie's thoughtful gift ! Ah, yes, there is much more sentiment in many a faded shawl or old-fashioned gown than in the newest, glossiest, most elegant, most graceful, and captivating acquisition to the toilette, fresh from the showroom of Madame Duval herself. Dress as you choose, if you will but attend to the following restrictions. Do not give to dress more than a modest portion of your hours and ideas. Do not bestow upon it all, or all save a fraction, of any allowance of pocket-money which you may obtain, so that you have next to nothing for works of affection, benevo lence, and charity, and are ashamed to give such a veritable widow's mite out of what was originally much x"], [312, "298 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. more than the widow's store. I would ask you some quiet Sunday evening, some day when you are recover ing from sickness, some still hour succeeding the palpitation of great joy or great sorrow, if these are not habits of self-indulgence unbecoming a Christian girl, \u2014 if, while you were by no means dressed like a fright, a quakeress, or a nun, you might not at the same time have been simple and economical ? Do not be feverishly anxious to be more ' stylish ' than your companions, and feverishly elated when you attain your end. ' Stylish ' has replaced our old word ' genteel,' and I doubt if it is much to our advantage. I have heard ' stylish ' used by pure, sweet, sensible lips, when it did not sound amiss ; but if it ordinarily means to be out of your rank in costume, or so conspicuous and singular in the shape and trimming of your wearing apparel, as to cause people to gape and stare when they encounter you in the streets or in society, then stylishness is simply very bad taste. Whatever is un suitable to your station, offends the judgment, and the judgment guides every eye but the eye of a fool. To be notorious for the cut and colour of your garments, has been in every age the temporary ebullition of eccen tricity, or the sign of a weak, low, or giddy mind. If, again, stylishness in its better sense merely indi cates a craving after personal distinction, you are surely old enough to observe that this peculiarity, like beauty, is a gift, a grand attractive gift ; but no more to be won by you in its details (the bend of the head, the inclina tion of the shoulders, the freedom and elasticity of"], [313, "Fashion. 299 motion, which lends such a fascination to the bonnet, such a charm to the folds of the mantle, such a some thing unsurpassable even to the sweep of the skirts) than are the pearly skin, the rose-leaf bloom, or the Gre cian, Roman, or clear composite Saxon features which have not been granted to you. If you do possess them, they need little embellishment ; if you do not possess them, why hanker after them in your silliness, now that you have given up the paint -pot -with which your ances tresses, in the reigns of Anne and the first Georges, daubed their sallow cheeks ' a fine red ?' Renounce also the peacock's feathers, which will not transform you, my poor jay ! which will only render you ridicu lous, and exhaust your capacity for a thousand other enjoyments. Rise up in your native dignity, equal and sometimes superior to my lady swimming or tripping along. Love to contemplate my lady in nature with an honest, unenvious admiration, and love to regard her also in art from the brush of Sir Joshua, Gainsborough, or Sir Henry Lawrence. But whether you are dumpy or a scarecrow, be so without a sigh ; there is some thing as good if not better for you ; yield my lady her sphere and assume your own, \u2014 be sure it exists for you somewhere, if you will only have the patience to hunt about for it, or quietly await it. This attempt to be all equally elegant and graceful, and not what many of us must be content to remain, merely unobtrusive, unas suming persons, is a monomania among women. With regard to the fashionable waste of time, perhaps the abuse exists most notoriously in towns and great"], [314, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 300 towns. There, no one can pass along the streets on business or pleasure without being struck with the crowds of young girls who are promenading neither for the one purpose nor the other. No one can enter a public exhibition without being harassed, well-nigh persecuted by the multitude of idle women, who are there openly and ostensibly to see and be seen ; to meet their acquaintances ; io lounge, lunch, gossip, and to do anything but look at the pictures, or suffer others to look at them. One might be driven to desire that societies should make a little sacrifice, and inscribe over their doors, ' Only for the lovers of art and science ; no loud greetings, no standing about, or planting of bodies for hours on convenient benches ; no continuous chatter allowed.' This is only the public side of the nuisance. How many daily inflictions there are in the shape of dawdling visits, where there is nothing to say, nothing to hear, and where the outward presence is a mere pernicious habit, we dare not attempt to register. Now, there is no cause for this idle expenditure of time, for really, in consequence of it, days and weeks slip from you in the most unprofitable manner imagin able ; you know not how ; and if you are not vivacious, you get into such an indolent habit of sailing with the stream, that you lose all independence and originality of character. If you have performed the duties, developed the talents, cultivated the cheap, blithe pleasures we were describing, you have no such super abundant leisure to throw away. Remember, though"], [315, "Fashion. 301 your bountiful Father allows you a million of inno cent enjoyments and delights, to wanton trifling you are not free. It is demoralizing, and it is destructive ; it saps your earnestness, and it spends . your strength for nought. For 'every idle word,' you will have to give account ; that is very solemn. Do not let it frighten you from your innocent joyousness ; but do let it check you from a deliberate waste of many hours every day in unmeaning gadding, and loitering here and there and everywhere but at home. Of course, if you follow such pursuits with other motives and pur poses, at the request of parents, for the benefit of friends, the case is altogether different. It must be very worthless company, indeed, which a good intent does not justify and ennoble. But, speaking of the practice in its purely primitive aspect, I would warn you against it. It is no reason why you should gad, that it is the fashion ; it is very little excuse for your frivolity, that other girls are not sensible and serious at proper times. Do you set the example, and act like the little boy at Rugby, who said his morning prayers, though the other boys shied boots at his head. Who can tell whether your companions wist not be drawn by your courage and wisdom, until gadding and dawd ling and dropping in upon each other at all hours, without sound friendship, without strong sympathy, without anything but vacuity of heart and brain, will be the exception instead of the rale ?

Still there can be little question that the temptation to dissipation is far less at home than abroad ; and in the first half-dozen of these papers, I have wished to offer, to any who will use them, suggestions, which may help them to avoid this shallow, superficial course, and to adopt another walk\u2014 that of being in earnest in all their ways. FRENCH DOLLS. It was bondage, the life which Fanchon and Aime'e Le Bran led. If they had not been brave girls, they could not have borne it; if it had not been a question of fashion, and French fashion, they would have needed to have been the noblest of the noble, to have fought it out They were not very noble, poor things, only lively, courageous French women, with sallow skins, black eyes, irregular features, mobile faces, altogether a little monkey-like sometimes, but very merry, as the monkey is when it chatters over its nuts, and faithful as the monkey can be to its monkey ties. I like them better than the lackadaisical theatrical French woman, with"], [317, "Fashion. 303 her sentiment and her guile; though, unquestionably, I much prefer the noble French woman, like Madame Roland, the tender-hearted French woman, like Madame de SeVigne, or the devoted French woman, like Madame de la Rochejaquelin, to either. They were open, like children, in their mischief, and their ingenuity was very like the ingenuity of children. You must not suppose they were stupid or slow ; they were very clever, very quick. I wish you had seen them dressed for an evening party ; I wish you had heard them during that ' evening.' They lived during the old regime, about the beginning of the terrible regime of the Nineties, in Paris. Their father was a colonel in the army, of good family, and with a handsome pension ; but, for some reason or other, he kept his family bare of money. Their mother was dead, and their aunt took them into society, toler ably high society of the time, where Fanchon and Aimee were west received, though they were not yet promised in marriage, notwithstanding it was supposed they would have fair doweries for Frenchwomen. Perhaps this com fortable view of the case tended to make Fanchon and Aime'e break bounds. Their aunt always thought they did her great credit. Her only grief about her charges was that they had no conventual stillness about them ; they were not retiring and mute, as young girls should be. They spoke and laughed almost like married women. After all, these dreadful Nineties shook the proprieties of Frenchwomen ; the excitement pervading all classes, the general interest of the questions mooted, the cloud hanging luridly and heavily over the country,"], [318, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 304 until it caught the most careless eyes, rendered the Frenchwomen of the Nineties a different order of Frenchwomen from any that went before or came after them. But it was only the beginning of the time, and the Le Brans were no great politicians ; they only knew enough of the raging, conflicting currents of the day, to be aware that it required exquisite tact, a kind of second instinct, fine, shrewd, and chameleon-like, to encounter them successfully ; and they did so encounter them with their light heads and barren experiences. You may think that it was heartless even in the young Le Brans to be so little affected by the straits of the people, the peril of kings, that they should dance on in the salons after they had seen that ghastliest dance of the people in the streets ; but remember when Troy was on the eve of falling, there was only Cassandra among the Trojan maids who refused to dance and sing, and Cassandra was a pro phetess. Remember, if you live in such times, you acquire only a confused perception of them. Party pre judices and partialities and self-interests bewilder great and honest statesmen, not to say flighty young girls. It is a vastly different thing to stand and look back on history, and to live that history. Besides, candidly now, who are the people who care to lose their heads and break their hearts for the wants of the poor, the sorrows of the mighty ? With a few honourable exceptions, you will not find them among ' the garden of girls,' and no blame to them.

Themselves and their friends occupying their foreground, how can you expect them to reach the background immediately, or to take the whole creation into their canvas at once ! Fanchon and Aime'e had enough to do, as they under stood life. I have told you that they moved in high society, and that their father allowed them but a limited portion of his income, and the times were frightfully dear for young ladies in society, as well as for workmen's wives clamouring for bread. You wist remind me that the French, with excellent taste, cause their young girls to appear simply clad ; but I doubt if this was so much the case before the Revolution as after it ; and the sim plicity of the upper classes is never perfectly lost to ex pense, it is a kind of French-shepherdess simplicity \u2014 the perfection of art very difficult to attain, and often in its details quite costly to small purses. You have often enough heard of making a great show on small means ; that was what Fanchon and Aime'e had to do when most girls only wore their clothes, and never troubled themselves how they were bought ; smelt their bouquets, and never hunted Covent-garden to get a rose at half-price. Fanchon and Aime'e first toiled for their splendour, and then sported it ; a second toil, and rather an oppressive and dangerous one on the verge of a French revolution. It is remarkable what a sense of praiseworthiness attaches to this doubtful virtue of making a great show on small means. Stern moralists denounce it, but stern"], [320, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 306 moralists are not the voice of the public ; and, oh, the good women and true I have heard commend, applaud, and take it to their hearts ! ' How very well-doing in them, poor things, to make one shilling look like two ! how creditable it is in them to contrive to present such a respectable appearance ! what excellent wives they will make!' The whole of this is neither more nor less than a cheat. I don't pretend to be better than my neighbours. I am sensible I listen with an immoral animation to the shifts which Fanchon and Aime'e have made for their bravery ; I look with an immoral pride on my black eyed girls, so full of grace and espieglerie, and with so elegant a tournure in their gauze trains, which cost, I dare not say, how little a yard ; and their fans, which are only painted pasteboard ; and their powder, which is the coarsest of flour. I feel ashamed of myself, angry with myself, until I reflect it is the qualities I hanker after, and not the ends ; that in theory I hate laziness, vacuity, sloth, supineness ; that I love my French puppets for their energy, ready resource, untiring in dustry, and forget that they are but dolls aft all, \u2014 sprightly dolls, it may be, but dolls, movir 'v to the artificial springs of the opinions of socie the customs of fashion. It was hard work with Fanchon and Aime'e. Often they sat in a back room all day, sewing like the veriest drudges of sempstresses, and never receiving a penny for tiieir labour ; giving out rather the few pennies they possessed. When the Colonel was abroad, they fasted"], [321, "Fashion. 307 as religiously as on Friday. I declare to you, these young, growing, hungry girls were sometimes giddy from insufficient or improper food, and often experienced violent nervous headaches from the same cause ; and this they endured that they might procure sandals from the royal Marie Antoinette's boot-maker ! They would traverse the whole disorderly city, under the care of the old porteress, with thick veils over their hats, choking for breath, and ready to sink on the trotfoirwiih fatigue, for the cheapest set of Roman pearls, when everything Roman was coming into vogue. Worse than that, the girls were shabby in their remuneration of the old porteress ; who had no longer the wages of her husband and sons, as they deserted their trades to watch with haggard, fierce faces at the doors of the clubs, and obtain, second-hand, the wild eloquence, which they drank in like a dram of fiery cognac. Fanchon or Aime'e would endow her with a fragment of sodden galette, a jar of fermented confiture, a spangled, cast-off scarf or apron, of no use whatever to the poor woman, unless she were willing to foot Paris, city and faubourgs, bridges and ruelles, a second time, to dispose of it to the smallest profit. This was not because Fanchon and Aime'e were naturally grasping and covetous. They were good-natured and kindly, but they drove such hard bargains themselves, they travelled such weary roads often, they ate such inferior galette and thin confiture with sharp appetites, that broken victuals, and cast-off clothes magnified themselves in their imaginations, and became quite good enough for Mere Coralie. If you"], [322, "308 Papers for Thoughtful Girls. would seek out those who are the hardest of the hard to dependants, and that often without the most distant consciousness of the fact, you will find them among the suffering bond-slaves of fashion, the poor, labouring men and women, who would fain make ropes out of sand \u2014 a great show on small means. Many a time Fanchon and Aime'e were cruelly dis appointed, cheerful as they were by constitution. They would go out in their hard-won, though flimsy company dresses, and an insipid heiress from the provinces, a dashing prononcee dame, with a sullied reputation (poor thing, poor thing, speak gently of her, all her stains were washed out in the blood-pool beneath the guillotine), far, far outshone them. They grew so desperate in their race after costume and style, that they lost sight of their own crystal ornaments of gri sette-gaiety, they would let themselves be extinguished by such trifling advantages as Mademoiselle BeVille's white crape, and Madame de Biron's amazonian girdle. They would sit discomfited and heart-broken, unless they happened to be placed between a royalist banker and a republican journalist, each an unexceptionable parti, and found themselves imperatively called upon to conduct a light, airy conversation so as to please both of them. Many a time they returned home spent with exertion unrewarded, and vexation unalloyed by the gentle consolations of gentler minds.

They were admired also, no doubt, for what was better understood \u2014 their grand air, their lively gestures, their nimble dancing.

He tried hard to lay by a provision for a rainy day. He was not so fortunate in securing his funds, as in saving the lives of his family. The thunder-bolt burst an hour too soon. Monsieur's store was so far safe, that it was regained by his grandchildren ; but it was never out of France ; not a franc of it was fingered by himself in his adversity. What of that? They must fly \u2014 all the same \u2014 for life and liberty ; and thrice happy they who escaped with them. What was beginning the world anew among the cold looks of strangers, to remaining in that city of destruction 1 It was a small consideration that the fugitives were, many of them, up in years ; and that the obscure by-paths in which they now sought fortune, and the aching joints and sweating brows which the pursuit brought them, had been unknown in their youth and prime. If their hearts failed them, yonder across the channel was a hecatomb of slaughtered dead to scare them with horror, when it did not fire them with fury. But they were Frenchmen ; they were philoso phers ; they would bear their misfortunes even jauntily ; they would scrape together the means of existence ; they would make bold strokes, not for wives, but for mouthfuls of vegetables and cups of coffee ; they would live where an Englishman would starve, and pick up their corn among his unobservant, stiff, clumsy feet. Fanchon and Aime'e had known little more of the coming desolation ; they had grown used to conventions"], [325, "Fashion. 311 and national guards. They had been out dancing at an assembly, and there was no fureur among the guests that they had seen; no barricades in the streets, no blood on the hands of the citizens. But when they returned home, Monsieur le Bran was waiting for them ; he showed the astonished girls passports; he bade them put on their plainest clothes for a long journey; he informed them that a carriage, which would pass through the nearest gates and join a diligence, would be at the door within an hour. But their aunt, their friends, their engagements, their mattes; how could they possibly pack up their malles within an hour ? Monsieur was imperturbable. Perhaps he had already heard of Marie Antoinette and her n'eces saire, which cost her so dear. The girls submitted, as only French girls would do, and collected more trash of valuables within the hour than any but Frenchwomen could accomplish. I daresay they spent their time upon that, rather than visiting every corner of the old house in the Rue Rivoli, and kissing and crying over the porteress. The inexorable Colonel, trained to mili tary lightness of baggage, threw out all their bundles before he stepped into the fiacre ; still the girls only clasped their hands, and raised their black eyes, and marvelled and schemed how they were to obtain new necklaces. A hurried, dismal journey to the coast, a huddled to gether, rough, wretched passage from port to port, and very cheap lodgings high in the air, somewhere near Covent Garden, were the next stages in the story of my"], [326, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 312 poor dolls. There they lived for a while, depending on Monsieur's lessons in languages. Their life was not so different from their former one, except that it wanted all the sauce and spice. They moiled with the farthings of Monsieur's earnings to keep up the faint copies of their elaborate toilettes. When the weather was very fine, and their cheap toilettes especially effective, they walked in Kensington Gardens and the parks, and were brushed by the rich skirts of the English ladies, and occasionally bespattered by the riders. They had always the French chapel, where they encountered a few well-known faces whom they could not afford to entertain at close quarters, and who, as they well knew, were making as frantic efforts as they were themselves to preserve their soiled gold lace, their threadbare cloth and em broidery. There they whispered to each other real tragedies, and surely worshipped with more fervour in their extremity. It was a sad, aimless mockery of a life, and the girls could not avoid perceiving how wrecked it was. Then they would exclaim in their liquid French, and cry their bright black eyes as dim as such eyes could become. One cold, chist winter day, the Colonel was pro strated by rheumatism ; he rose, but could not stand ; he tried to lift his hand to his head, but failed, with the arm so racked by pain that it was incapable of any other activity. The exposures of his old campaigns were telling upon him, now that his pension was forfeited."], [327, "Fashion. 313 The girls did not look at each other, and fold their hands ; they were not like dolls at this crisis. ' Fanchon, it is necessary that we work for ourselves and our father.' 'Yes, Aime'e, let us begin. What will you that we try?' They never hesitated. The doctor was impressed and edified by the resignation with which they listened to his cautious warnings of how little poor Monsieur's powers could be depended upon in the future, and with the alacrity with which they set about their search for employment. Even Monsieur was not prostrated in mind by the prostration of his body. He had treated his daughters as dolls, still more than I have done, but he never seemed to doubt that they would come for ward as very useful dolls when the occasion demanded it of them. Fanchon and Aime'e laid their heads together on then qualifications \u2014 their stock in trade. Of all takings of stock, this is perhaps the one usually involving the most trepidation, the most cowardly palpitations, and despe rately faint hearts. But the French girls did it coolly. They thought of dancing, giving lessons in dancing to schools and private families. They had not interest and accomplishments for the stage, or I don't think they would have repudiated it. They had to give up the idea of dancing. At that era every pension required an Adonis, in knee-breeches and buckles, to preside over the Terpsichore ; the market was glutted, and the yestow, grinning marquises, barons, and counts had the Y"], [328, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 314 best of it. Then they thought of artificial flower-making, which they had learnt in their convent-parlour, and pro secuted for their own convenience. Here they were likely to be more successful ; and a very little capital provided the cambric, the vermilion, the ultramarine, the jonquil yellow, the wire, and the gum. How skil fully and rapidly the girls manufactured their wares ! What bunches of jasmine, what pink and white lilies (being French, they did not confine themselves to white lilies ; pink lilies were charmants, ravissants, and so they proceeded boldly to their construction), and such French, such very French forget-me-nots. When they had completed their performances, they disposed of them to the shops themselves quite easily and safely. They were accustomed to shopping ; and the linen drapers, milliners, dressmakers, liked the workers, liked their punctuality, their self-reliance, the vivacity of their broken English. As for enemies, sinister patrons, these girls detected them at a glance and shunned them. They could take care of themselves, young as they were, as honest, fearless, alert girls can generally do. Mon sieur, too, Monsieur had faith in them, to his honour as a Frenchman, or else to the honour of the England, the perfide Albion, in which he trusted, Monsieur relied on his girls without a qualm. The milliners and mantua makers would ask Fanchon and AimeVs advice with regard to the disposal of the sprigs and wreaths, and would engage their tasfe and expertness for half days and whole days together. They fell in with some of their own countrymen ; thev got work to carry home,"], [329, "Fashion. 315 so they varied their trades and acquired double profits , and they were so keen, so zealous, and withal so good humoured, they so enjoyed making money and handing it over to the Colonel, though they were not avaricious ! They had their crosses, of course ; crosses are not con fined to ladies of fashion, but they did not take them half so much to heart as T/hen they led a centreless, pointless whirl of a life. I daresay, when their French natures were tempted to long for the footlights, the dancing, and a more effervescent admiration than that of the honest shopkeepers, they thought with a shudder of the horrors that were then being enacted in gay, distin guished France, and thanked heaven for their dull, obscure banishment. Fanchon and Aime'e had no time now for their grand toilettes d la baronne; their plaiting, and pinching, and curling, and rustling here and there before a little oval looking-glass, with only themselves to please and profit by their application. They sat with their crisp hair twisted under their little caps, in their peignoirs. I wish I could say these peignoirs were as fresh and nice as they should have been ; but then, I have vowed to tell nothing but the truth, as far as my judgment goes, and these faded, crushed peignoirs clad young, plump, agile bodies, and did not offend Monsieur, since he could not have the floating muslin, white or rose tendre colours, which the French hold fittest for young girls. No ; nor did they offend any friend and countryman who called to play a game of dominoes with the Colonel, and chat with the girls. Dear Fanchon and Aime'e began anew"], [330, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 316 to sing their old romances and barcarolles, and to give them more gleefully than in the salons of Paris. Fanchon and Aime'e had an invitation to Richmond, to a party of emigres. It was one of those fete days, which they had been wont to respect almost as they had respected mass and the confessional, and it was to be celebrated in the country, the summer-country, and the celebration included the company of equals, sunshine, talk, and laughter, and, perhaps, in conclusion, a dance on the green. What were not all these to the two con fined, toiling work-women ? ' Yet, we cannot go,' cries Fanchon ; ' see, we have that sheaf of roses to complete ; we have promised, and we must not offend Monsieur, who employed us first.' ' But if we sit up very late,' urges poor Aime'e, plain tively ; ' we have no pleasure now, Fanchon ; and our father is so well, he could do without us for a day. Could we not manage it V ' It might have been possible, Aime'e, had it not been for our dress ; but we cannot go like work-people. We would need to sit up a whole night to wash and starch and iron our gowns and mantles, and to dye our gloves, ribbons, and fichus, and very triste they would appear when all was done, my sister.' ' I wish we could go like work-people,' sighs Aimee. ' Impossible,' replies Fanchon, with unusual tart ness ; but when Aime'e repeats how well they and their circumstances are known among their friends ; how irresponsible they are for the disasters of la belle France, how they could wear \u2014 what could they wear ? not the"], [331, "Fashion. 317 peignoirs, but the pretty calicos which the worthy linen draper gave them over and above their payment, and gipsy-hats \u2014 ' and then, do you know, Fanchon, theymight think it was la pastorale \u2014 that we were masquerading.' 'Bah!' exclaims Fanchon, 'that deceives nobody; but as you are devoured with chagrin because we miss the day in the country, and as it is in England, and yet among our own people, we may think of going en des habille; but mind, Aime'e, mind we can never show our faces in Paris again, if it comes to be known.' ' Ah ! I will leave dear Paris to take care of itself,' declares fickle Aime'e, and darts to the drawers to ex amine the calicos in which they are to figure perforce en pastorale. The girls go to their fete as simply dressed as hay-makers of a Sunday, but still with their nameless elegance and grace. They delight in the view, the trees, the grass, the primroses, the very singing-birds are novelties to them ; they delight in the most rustic food, eaten in the rustic inn ; they stroll about, and exchange sparkling French witticisms and picturesque French sentiments. 'And, Fanchon, how happy we have been,' says Aime'e, on her return to the garret, near Covent Garden, ' as happy as if we had worn diamonds.' ' Test that to your bridegroom, Aime'e, before he fur nishes your corbeille; but, after all, it is true, I never was sappier in France ; it sounds unfaithful, but I believe it & because we are so occupied here, and it is so much more of a fete to us now than it used to be.'

It is so pleasant this sort of society, so im promptu, so easy.' ' Fain'ea7ite ! you want to go out like a school-girl; you forget the bienseances, the proprietes, our rank, our class. Alas ! we have paid sufficiently for them, to prize them for ever.' Notwithstanding, Fanchon and Aimee forgot the proprietes, the bienseances, more and more, went out like simple maids, and did not trouble themselves to be belles and queens, and so had all the cream and honey of their entertainments so long as they tarried in Eng land."], [333, "XII. THE LIFE OF PRIDE AND LEVITY. ' I \"HERE has been always a tendency in the world to withdraw pride from its place among the deadly sins, and that in spite of direct denunciations against it ' Pride cometh before destruction.' ' God hateth a high look.' This favour seems to arise from two causes. Pride itself is a hard, selfish, and actually mean tem per in its narrowness and arrogance ; but no other dis position has such a faculty of clothing itself like an angel of light, putting on the garb and showing the fea tures of dignity, nobleness, magnanimity. For a second stronger reason, other qualities are habitually mistaken for pride. Shyness, for instance, which is often found in company with its opposite, humility; self-respect, which is an honest man's inheritance ; independence, which is a brave man's portion ; bluntness, which we cannot, for the life o. us, dissever from truth. Call pride insolence, whether superb or vulgar, and you wist make no mistakes. The impatience of inter ference with your plans, the loud or dogged assertion of your will, the slighting or sweeping condemnation of all beneath your sovereign notice ; these are very unlovely"], [334, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 320 and unloveable. But this tone, like that of mock igno rance of household work and rural economy, is, we are glad to say, much exploded with women, in so far as clearly established inferiors are concerned. Few girls hector in a shop, or storm over a servant, before their asso ciates, because they are very well aware that in so doing many eyes will be fixed on them in censure. They have learned at last that it is not like gentlewomen to be imperious and tyrannical. Where they can undoubt edly command, and where they feel a strong call to be insolent, they are merely languid, supercilious, and sneering. But it is in that ' debatable land ' which a good, earnest writer has classed as ' the missing link ' in the social chain, that insolence remains ram pant. Among acquaintances, a shade removed in rank and refinement, inferiors by an inappreciable degree, which no mortal would take the trouble to reckon, \u2014 it is towards the commonplace, the tire some, the shabby, that insolence still flourishes in full bloom. It is by what are called ' Cuts,' by shades of cordiality, varying far more suddenly and violently than our weather-gauges, that simple, sincere folk are tried. ' Really the way that girl bowed to me in the Crescent was insufferable. I can bear a good deal of nonsense from girls, having had girls of my own ; but for a child like that to think it a fit thing to recognise a staid old woman like me, by simply lowering her eye-lids !' com plains the respectable mother of a family ; ' and it was only in spring she sent her love, and could I give her"], [335, "The Life of Pride and Levity. 321 some bramble-jam for her cold; nothing did her good like my bramble-jam, and I am sure I did not grudge it. I was delighted that she should have recourse to me ; but I must say I expected a little livelier sense of my existence.' ' They are all the same, mother,' answers a little bit terly the somewhat worn eldest daughter, at the same time much more indignant at the slight put upon her mother than at any neglect to herself. ' If you had seen how reluctant Agnes Jones was to see me to-day, because she was walking with the Stephensons. I shall be blind enough the next time I meet her, though it should be before her admirer, Mr. Forester, who was so much obliged to my brother George.' No, no, Agnes, you will forgive and forget ; you will warm your sometimes weary heart by the consciousness that you have not done anything to spoil Agnes Jones's fine prospects, little as she thanks you for it ; and long after this small vexation is past and gone, you, who are so candid and loving, will understand to the full that verse of the psalm, ' Thou hast put more joy and glad ness in my cup since the time that their corn and oil and wine abounded.' But in our day the life of pride, of strong, domineer ing self-importance, has generally accepted also the cue of the life of levity, \u2014 the life which finds a joke in every thing, which laughs at all reverence, earnestness, and romance. It is one of the hardest and most hostil; aspects of the human mind which you can encounter. Talk to a young lady who aspires to be 'fast' \u2014 who"], [336, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 322 quotes the broadest slang, and must have ' larks,' if not ' sprees ' \u2014 talk of self-sacrifice, of high, pure thoughts, of lives happy in their holiness, and she will vote you ' slow,' shrug her shoulders, remark upon your neck ribbon or your bootlace, be witty at your expense, and have nothing more to do with you. She may have too much passive principle to denominate your conversation humbug, but she will think you old-fashioned, prudish, sentimental, superannuated, officious, intrusive. She will jeer at you unmercifully, or be seriously incensed if you provoke her further. All the while she may pay respect to the outward forms of religion, to churches, prayer-meetings, Sabbath-schools, benevolent societies, private devotions, and far be it from me to say she is insincere ; but there is surely the oddest incongruity in her conduct. Now a good laugh is an excellent thing, and the most of us firmly credit it is enjoyed in its perfection by the best men and women in the world. We can set oui seals to the description of such sick-rooms as George Wilson's, where the good and patient lie not only in an attitude of meekness and resignation, but spread around them a clear, sunny atmosphere of humour and fun. Who should be happy but those who are at peace with God and man? But this incapacity for viewing any thing under a serious aspect, this incredulity of all high duty, sustained effort, generous self-abnegation, and growing unworldliness is, we should venture to say, very far from what our worthiest humorist contemplates. If I recollect aright, a son of Legh Richmond's spoke"], [337, "The Life of Pride and Levity. 323 severely on his deathbed against the former merry cast of his conversation on all topics with a young sister. Reading this observation when very young, it pained me, and I thought it very harsh. I still regard it as extremely morbid. The young will gambol in mind as well as body. Their Maker gave them this early buoy ancy, and we may well shrink from taking it from them. I would never object to its use, only to its abuse. I am aware there are some kindly spirits who retain this blessed buoyancy to old age. I know there are con stitutions whose deep feelings almost always speak half jestingly, with a touch of the comic for ever relieving the tragic side of their natures. There are those who would be sombre without this tendency, and whose sense of pathos is so quick and keen that they are glad to weld it with laughter, to take off, as it were, the piquant edge of its pitifulness, and they generally pre serve the characteristic to the last. I am not sure whether it is not a healthful counterbalance to save them from moping melancholy or desperate despair. But this is quite another thing from that bold levity which regards all life as a joke, and whose desire after sport is as keen as any hunter's or fisher's. The zest with which such girls follow amusement, in the shape of practical jokes, and making butts of weak acquaintances, has been before now exposed. But a good girl will hold back from such a course ; ' her delicate sense of honour' will prevent her from being a party to any modified version of the frolics which appear to form a distinguishing feature of some departments of her Ma-"], [338, "Papers f oi- 'Thoughtful Girls. 324 jesty's service. Her fuller, richer nature will reject with aversion the emptiness of laughter which has no strong background of thought and feeling. She will not live a life of rushing here and there, and giggling violently. Her quiet perception of propriety will revolt at the personal notoriety which captivates the other girls. For you will find that the great desire of the poor girl, born and bred to the life of pride and levity, is to make you stare, to confound your sober senses, to strut before you, to push you out of your place, to tread on your skirts, and finally to eclipse your view with her high, vain head, and to raise a noisy clamour which shall effectually drown all grave discussion, considerate fore thought, and tender memories and anticipations. THE ROOMS IN THE OLD HOUSE. THE first room. The house was an old London house, near the river. It was a house of some age at the time of which I write, as it showed by its wide, low doors, its mullioned win dows, its fine oak carvings ; but it was so conveniently and pleasantly situated, that it continued a dwelling place of the quality for several generations to come. The water was still the water of painted barges and gilded wherries. It was still the pink of the mode, and the delight of all delights for women gay, idle, and luxu rious, to loll in these deep windows, examine the com pany on the river award and apportion signals and"], [339, "The Life of Pride and L evity. 325 make eyes to the rowers of their acquaintance. Occa sionally the parties, engaged in this profitable employ ment, wore masks ; but they were frequently as eager to display their own persons, as to study those of their neighbours. I want to show you this house as it appeared in 166 in one of its rooms overhanging the river. Among the women who clustered on its window-seat, were the companions of the Hamilton, the Stewart, the Carlisle ; and only once have a set so graceless and shameless disgraced our England. Modest, true women shrink still from their bold brows, full lips, and wanton eyes, from their affectation and their voluptuousness, as they meet face to face their likenesses abounding in picture gasteries. There they sit, these miserable beauties of an English reign, the ripe fruit of pride and levity, of utter heartlessness, and of a far lower tone of principle than many an old Greek and Roman attained in his own wisdom, and amidst the darkness and corruption of the heathen world. We know the little curls plastered on the round ivory brows, and soft pink cheeks, and hanging thick and full in studied luxuriance on the arched necks ; the white arms, all bare, flung out on the window-sill ; the costly lace floating loose from the shoulders ; the sweeping trains. How well we know Xhem, and how little we like them ! Who would seek such women as these for wives and mothers? Who would not recoil from intimate communion with their base beauty, as from the dead whiteness of leprosy ? There the women jeer at each other, and at the spec-"], [340, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 326 tacle before them. Nothing elevates them, nothing touches them ; they geek in their vanity, or they snap in their viciousness \u2014 all the same. They play with their spaniels at their elbows, or they feed the ducks down below \u2014 for fondling of animals is the fashion of the day; but they show no reverence, no mercy for humanity. A couple of citizens, husband and wife, some Pepys and his partner, a man who lies and cheats, a woman who slaps her maids and apes coart follies, but yet who are not wholly without perceptions of feeling and duty, sail by, and they rail at them like so many furies. They rail worse when a boat, with men in cassocks, accommo dating but well-meaning Burnet among them, follows in the track. But when the boat with the Life-guardsmen, in their scarlet and gold, approaches, and one is holding his feathered hat in his hand, and conceitedly combing his scented wig with an ivory comb, and another is rising and bowing, his hand on his heart, with impudent gallantry ; then they nod, and smile, and mince, and swim, and fan themselves, and dart glances of hatred at each other, until one knows not whether to sink to the ground with affront at their voluntary idiocy or grief at their universal malice. A funeral in sable and crape, with muffled music and wailing dirge, floats under the window, and one smells at her essence-box, and another flouts at the chief mourner. One poor sinner may wince and droop her head, thinking, with a canker in her heart, of her old father and mother under the yews in the country church-yard ; or of her little child, to watch by whose dying bed she did desert for a night"], [341, "The Life of Pride and Levity. 327 or so the king's or the duke's theatre; but her com panions make faces at the poor wretch behind her back, and, looking into her dim eyes, twit her with hypocrisy. A brave marriage-party, with flutes and hautboys and waving flags, a smiling bridegroom, a blushing bride, a troop of exulting friends, flash and ring upon the sym pathetic water, that reflects back their gladness ; and they tell an odious story of the bride, and they pity the bridegroom. Do you revolt at the scene and the actors ? Then lay this lesson to iieart ; pride and levity were once triumphant in England, and such were their children."], [342, "XIII THE LIFE OF SENSE AND HEAVINESS. HPHERE is another life, the reverse of that of pride and levity, and yet, in many respects, insipid, in capable of enduring excellence, and unfit for immortality. I do not know that it is so attractive to young girls. I think it is more a dull refuge for those who have been smitten, who have begun existence eager and sensitive, but who have experienced disappointment, and in its sting and chill have sullenly or apathetically resolved to be content with what is ; for, alas ! the life of sense and heaviness is no better than a Christianized version of ' Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' But there are endless exceptions to all rales ; and to the craving, restless spirit of every age, enduring the pangs of hun ger, and the wounds of being baffled and braised in the prison-house of this world, the waters of Lethe murmur of rest, quiescence, torpor. Ah ! but these waters of Lethe are very different from the waters which the gos pel discloses ; the last are the waters of life, the living fountains ;' and the first are the waters of forgetfulness, stupefaction, death. In this life of sense and heaviness there may be, there"], [343, "The Life of Sense and Heaviness. 329 almost invariably is, as there can be even in a Use of pride and levity, a scrupulous attention to all outward spiritual adjuncts, but within there is a singular sluggish ness and coldness. There is, generally, an inclination to repudiate utterly all chivalrous, romantic adventure and speculation, forgetting how these things were wont to pertain to Christianity. There is a disposition to merge all individuality into one mould and pattern ; and, therefore, this life of sense and heaviness recom mends itself exceedingly to the stolid, the timid, and the lazy, as very respectable. Nothing erratic about it ; no perplexing paradox, no disastrous, no shameful fall ! Respectability and comfort are the leading articles of this life ; for men, having renounced passion and imagination, naturally fall back on what they con sider the lawful gratification of their senses, after they have performed their duty in their business and their church. Families of this type have the most commodious houses, the most prolific gardens (they take more to vegetables than to flowers), and, if they are of sufficient wealth, the easiest carriages. They indulge in what we may call domestic luxuries and family extravagances. They generally deserve the credit of making all comfort able around them. They never know the shifts of the poor, pretentious slave of fashion. There is a commend able sincerity about them ; their inner garments are as soft and fine as their outer wear. They have a natural repugnance to what is glaring of every description ; per- haps, because in their patient, accurate, researches after"], [344, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 330 comfort and respectability, they have found too much light trying to the eye, and intoxicating to the brain. But the bugbear which they present to the world is dire dulness, and their mortal enemies are hardship and fatigue ; for very few things in this world, for no won ders of nature, or treasures of art will they undergo them. The voices in such families are carefully moderated, the faces calm : the daughters are self-possessed and still, industrious or idle, as it may be, but their industry is of the most matter-of-fact and humdrum description, as if something new and out of the way, even in a piece of fancy-work, would break the spell. This life has its virtues; it is a better life than its opposite life ; it is solvent, and it is not essentially and thoroughly false ; but it also is untrue to our higher natures ; and it also is, to a certain extent, demoralizing and degrading. Its most conspicuous disadvantage is stagnancy, and we are all well enough acquainted with the consequences of stagnancy in the material world. Here, too, thought and feeling lose their freshness and vigour. A life of sense and heaviness is a life of narrowness and sloth ; it is not a life of progress such as a Christian's should be ; it fosters intolerance, it checks heroism, and, my dear friend, if you do not know that heroism is identical with Christianity, then you greatly mistake either the one or the other. Look abroad, and see the results of this life hovering over many of the representatives of grim but glorious Puritans, wild but grand Covenanters, enthusiastic but ennobled Methodists. They are not satisfactory. They"], [345, "77/6' Life of Sense and Heaviness. 331 are a tenacious adherence to the swaddling bands of uncharitableness, and a kind of morose self-indulgence. Do not, then, let any young girl fancy that she is one of the salt of the earth, because she has never cared, or has ceased to care, for song or story, dance or jest, for travelling or painting ; because she confines herself to housekeeping and sewing useful work, and reading solid books, and taking a walk with papa and mamma ; be cause she abjures rambling and scrambling, and cannot sit up of nights, and is quite surprised that any one can be interested in such old-world foolery as belongs to May-momings and Yule-nights and Easter-days. Above all, do not let her think it very silly of her brother Harry to make such a work about his dog, and to be so set on soldiering; and do not let her conclude that he is seriously in the wrong when he will go away on these boisterous shooting and boating excursions, and insist on caring a thousand times more for games of ast sorts than she could ever do. THE SECOND ROOM. The window no longer looked to the water, but to the city street, dark with tast houses, and resounding with clatter and din. It was not that the inhabitants did not like the water, they did like it, and they liked trim gardens leading down to it, with formal walks, and clipped privet, box, and holly ; but they thought it a waste of time to indulge their tastes, and considered it"], [346, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 332 altogether more commendable to keep them in abey ance. So they sat in the front room, and worked at plain spinning and heavy white-seam. Dutch William was on the throne ; Blackmore was the poet ; Hans Sloane the painter; all was order, industry, and so briety. No matter that the order was rigidity, the industry drudgery, the sobriety primness. The flowing hair, the bare arms and shoulders, were all gone, and in their place the highest of stomachers, the stiffest of sleeves, and such a tower of ribbons and lace \u2014 ' pinners with purdan,' Swift called it \u2014 reared on the top of the head to confer dignity. We never had such an ugly headgear as in the reign of good Queen Mary, she whom her husband loved so well, she who died so sweetly. The work went on in that house by the river like clock-work. It was the fashion now to work. William worked in his council-chamber and on his battle-fields. His favourites were not given over to foppery and frippery. Albemarle worked ; Portland worked. What do you think of the Lord Mayor's wife, that worshipful madam, the Lady Mayoress, being a mantua-maker and milliner in William's reign, all for the glory of working ! It would be a remarkable thing in our day if women trooped to the Mansion-house to buy feathers and laces, in place of to wear them. It was not an unsatisfactory life to those who were used to it. Perhaps it was too satisfactory, puffed up the performers, rendered them swollen with a heavy species of pride, a dust inertness, a dogged self-conceit and stubbornness. But think"], [347, "The Life of Sense and Heaviness. 333 what this life must have been to a young thing from the country, from a lavish, careless, gay, gambolsome coun try-house. From hall and summer- parlour, from hunt ing and hawking, from sun-dial and sweet-pot, from frisking like the dogs, or basking, like them, on the door-step, from revelry which had only gaiety and glamour to a child \u2014 from these pleasant scenes a young girl was withdrawn, brought up to town, and deposited in the house by the river. The dame of Mary's reign vowed to fulfil in a pro per spirit the charge thrust on her. There should be no indulgence, no toying and trifling. She would expel the Egyptian blood ; she would rear the little cousin like her own staid, demure daughters ; and in this, take note, there was not merely strict justice, but worthy generosity. The child was slight and small-boned, and as suppie as an eel, with one of those olive complexions which show green with ill-health and rage, but which in vigour and joy are strangely, duskily, bright and beautiful, like a pomegranate. She had large eyes, which could flash and lighten and darken in a way which the dame (her aunt) said was more like a cat's eyes than a human being's. First when she came to London, she was stunned by misfortune, \u2014 the death of some of her family, the exile of others, the change from license and lightness to dependence and severe discipline. It took her months to revive and reassert her real nature. By that time her relations had got used to her presence, and they had come to consider her \u2014 not"], [348, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 334 unkindly, mind, never with wilful unkindness \u2014 as one of themselves, far behind them in available knowledge and capacity, but still one of themselves. They were as startled as they could well be when she began to ask when was their mumming and maying ; if they always droned on in this style ; if they had no diver sion. What ! neither at Christmas nor Easter \u2014 the Christian holidays, nor at Midsummer, the festival of the year, nor at the bountiful term of good St. Martin ? Her keepers did not suffer themselves to be amused ; they rebuked her when she was naughty, when she pro tested that she would go to sleep over that solemn dis cussion on the rival merits of altars and pulpits, lawn sleeves and Geneva gowns ; when she found fault with the solid meat, and demanded sweet cakes. They punished her, tasked her, imprisoned her, never in humanly, always with a quiet, methodical regard to what they considered her health and strength. They wondered why she did not improve ; they feared she was about to vindicate after all the hot reckless line of which she was come. They complained with truth, that she was not grateful for the trouble she cost them, since they could not term gratitude those fits of sorrow and remorse, and outbursts of inconsistent, incoherent affec tion with which she came creeping to their feet, and kissing their hands, and looking up at them with her large lustrous eyes, after her pets. These demonstra tions only plagued and distressed them. The dwellers in the house by the river could not have afforded their visitor much pleasure without departing"], [349, "The Life of Sense and Heaviness. 23 $ altogether from the stern mould of their life, and that could not have been expected of them. They allowed themselves almost no relaxation. They cared for no thing but the glorious Revolution and the pure Refor mation, and an honest and diligent life. They did not even make William's exceptions with regard to hunting and fighting. The head of the house was old and heavy, and could not ride furiously, and the wars were over. But they were as silent as William, and I fear, I fear, they would as phlegmatically and without a dream of sensuality have eaten up all the dish of pease from a Queen Mary or a Princess Anne of a third party. There was but one amusement which the house fairly commanded, and that was the river, and to that the stranger girl took with an intense addiction. Its pageants, as she called them, were like old home scenes and native air to her. She relished them, and she would, had she been permitted, have sat hours looking out on the ripple and wavelet, the summer-houses and landing-places, and above all on the perpetual passage of every description of company. Her glued-together lips sprang asunder ; her cold hands acquired a soft warmth, her eyes beamed, and from her mouth there burst a faint echo of the old blithe laughter. The dame forbade that waste of time, at first inci dentally, as an interference with becoming employment, then strictly as a penance, then austerely as a contra diction to her will, which she would not suffer. The child coaxed, begged, resisted furiously, defied the interdict, feigned to submit, and was treated as a"], [350, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 336 cheat and a liar. It was such a small matter of con tention, such a small, small matter ; and yet such a weight hung on its silken thread. She moped, sat with her face to the wall ; her olive colour grew green to ghastliness ; the white of her eye-balls looked blue by contrast, a film spread over the pupils. ' Madam,' said one of the young daughters of the house, in an anxious voice, ' I am frightened for Sac charissa, the crossing will kill her ; rather give in on such a trifle. I cannot understand why it should occa sion her grief and despair, but do not oppose her longer, and I will sit with her myself at the river window, and see that she stitches the bands.' ' Never, Dorcas ; it is pampering her folly. Grief and despair, forsooth ! A vile temper and a wanton mind. Yield to her lust for show and noise, and she wist have enough of the river before all is done.' ' Enough of the river.' Was that prophetical ? Macaulay recalls a tale of shame and woe in con nexion with a Quaker household two hundred years ago : and he has been censured for the ruthlessness with which he has prosecuted his study of moral anatomy. There is no one to be pained by my scanty exposure of a nameless victim ; and, besides, the family story was closely hushed up at the time, \u2014 only a few whispers got about of madness and self-destruction, of dabbled feet and draggled hair, and a little pouting mouth, cold and wan, defiled with mud and clay.

There was a grave and decor ous funeral, trembling, writhing women being all in the background, behind closed shutters and pulled-down window-blinds. I daresay they were reconciled in time to the unlooked-for tragedy by their good intentions. I can fancy that they would shake off their horror in their sense that they had done everything for the best ; and the doctors had stated there was hereditary disease, and a highly excited condition of the brain. Fai be it from me to take it upon me to pretend that they had no right to the solace. I would only ask the calm, sedate members of society to be humble, and admit there are things in the world never dreamt of in their philosophy ; to be pitiful and tender, lest, for some little matter, some very little matter, some repudiation of God's lights of nature and art, song and story, blossom of flower, and carol of bird, He asks of them \u2014 \" Where is thy sister, thy sensitive, impulsive sister, whom by a little conces sion you might have saved, but whom by a &reat denial yon destroyed V"], [352, "XIV. THE LIFE OF SARCASM AND BITTERNESS. '\"\"PHERE is another life to which the few, not the many, respond, and that is the life of sarcasm and bitterness. In this world, where there is so much that is absurd, in opposition to upright principles, good judgment, correct taste, it is sometimes hard not to snarl, if we are too conscientious and benevolent on the whole to sneer. Really it seems sometimes not a very unchristian act to turn upon our neighbours, and barb any arrows of scorn and derision which we possess, and shoot them off one after another, until we have pierced their callousness, and caused them to desist from their offences. We have done them good. Why should they distrust and detest us for ever after wards ? But just because they will do so, is sufficient evidence that irony is a weapon that can only be profitably used at a wide reach, and on rare occasions. Our neighbour may be more sensible since we galled her; but if she is more malicious, we have injured instead of benefiting her. They say, ' those who live in glass houses should not fiins srnnes.' Now, we all live in glass houses, and, rot"], [353, "The Life of Sarcasm and Bitterness. 339 from a selfish regard for our own safety, but from sheer modesty, we ought to be harmless as summer lightning in our strictures. The poison of folly and wronghead- edness coursing in our neighbour's veins is in our own, only it may have come out in another shape ; and per- haps our fellows are even now regarding its ebullitions and excrescences with a rage and contempt very similar to our own. But, any way, it is certainly there. So we should be tender and merciful, whether we are merry or wrathful ; and this very quality of tenderness and mercy is what distinguishes bland humour from its savage brother, wit. Who would say that Addison had not a perception of the oddities and errors of his con- temporaries ? Who would imagine that Shakspere was deficient in the observation of the world around him ? Yet, compare the large-hearted charity of him who was called ' gentle Willy,' and the Christian courtesy of Mr. Spectator, with the venom of Pope and Dryden and the terrible Dean ! and how much was society improved by their spite, while they themselves formed mere units in its thousands ? Where are many of the customs, and all the poor flesh-and-blood foes on whom they wreaked their vengeance ? Gone ; dead and gone. And so much of the genius which might have enlightened and sustained us for ages, wasted on these temporary hatreds. In women, vivacity was wont to be a standard charm, and, between ourselves, I think it is so still. I believe a great many of the descriptions of women, attractive from their shyness, abstraction, pensiveness, are \u2014 well, descriptions ' At least, I prize the lively women of"], [354, "Papers for Thoughtful Girls. 340 good old fiction and biography ; not the rattles, but the cordial, shrewd, sensible, though often prejudiced or partial women, like Lizzie Bennet (How proud and pleased I was when I first read Archbishop Whately's review of Miss Austen's novels !) I like my women to be practical, and sometimes brilliant ; and on that account I make great allowance for the trenchant tongues of those mighty independent dames and spinsters of Dean Ramsay's, for the sake of their raciness. But I must confess that, with women, the weapon of sharp ness, not to say bitterness, is a dangerous tool, apt to be bad for their acquaintances, and often very bad for themselves. It might be otherwise, when greater free dom of speech was licensed ; but now women have unanimously agreed to detest the person who takes them off, more than the person who deceives them. They prefer treachery to sarcasm. It may be a part of their timidity, their defective sense of justice, as men will have it ; but they cannot away with the lip curled and the laugh raised at their expense ; they cannot en dure it in the present, or forgive it in the past. Such a horror have they of this faculty or propensity, that, in my own experience as a woman, I have heard the most inoffensive, and \u2014 not to put a fine point upon it \u2014 the most incapable women unhesitatingly accused of the in sult ; and, without a trial, blackballed for it on the moment and for ever from friendly circles.

An innocent drag of good-humoured protest put on silliness, is withdrawn, and a drag all jagged with rough and cruel edges substituted in its place. The very effects presupposed are produced ; the sarcastic woman waxes self-conceited and sour. Deal with sarcasm, then, very sparingly, and with a very loving lightness. You know you are bound, inas much as lieth in you, to live peaceably with all men. On that account, do not be swift to fling down the chal lenge of biting gibes, or there will never be peace again for you. I should be sorry to spoil your archness or your sprightliness. I have a natural abhorrence to a mawkish, sleepy-headed, or sly girl, who will not give her opinion, much more from the fear of getting into a scrape, or from sheer stupidity, than from wisdom or gentleness ; but I do not see that you must needs be perverted into cowardly or cunning girls, by refraining from acerbity, or sweetening it until it becomes an agreeable tonic, rather than a kind of meat or drink to set the teeth on edge and rasp the throat. For your comfort, I can tell you that many of the liveliest and cleverest women who have ever existed have been the most agreeable, considerate, tolerant, patient, and hopeful.

I can refer you again to the example in Proverbs, where the same model woman who opened her mouth with wisdom, had on her tongue the law of kindness. THE THIRD ROOM. It was a room to the water again, but it was no longer ftverhanging the river, it was comparatively retired, and the company who occupied it were more engrossed with themselves and each other than with the procession before them. They glanced out occasionally to catch a suggestion whereon to hang a witticism, or a simile wherewith to point a repartee ; but they were sufficient for themselves, they needed no foreign element for their entertainment. The party had prints, manuscript verses, and cards before them, with Turkey coffee and claret. To do them justice, they confined themselves principally to the prints and the poems. They dealt with them in an insolent way. Insolence was their forte ; a story was told of a country parson who had stumbled amongst them, and, after listening to their talk, could not resist the astounding exclamation, ' Good people, do you live by your insolence?' Satire was the breath of their nostrih ; nothing was thought of, if it was not satirical. The great poets' grand diction and magnificent imagery would have been nothing without the stabs which they inflicted liberally.

These individuals would sacrifice anybody, anything, the dearest friend they possessed, to a clever saying. A sentence so savage, an epigram so neat in its contempt, that London would ring with it, would make any one of them turn his or her back on the others for ever. How the critics handled the verses before them ! Some of the verses were jaundiced, leering, snarling : those they treated with respect; at least they read them, luxuriated in them, found no fault with their horrible mis anthropy, their loathsome selfishness. Others were hackneyed and ststted enough, but with a kind of fan tastic meandering over milder, meeker ideas. These they attacked with the scalping-knife and the tomahawk, and despatched without quarter. It was not that they had no sympathy with the human feelings, no interest in the humanity which the weak lines expressed ; but they were like Anglo-Indians fed on curry alone. They could not commit themselves either, by betraying any weakness before each other. These literary men and women had to live constantly on their guard, as an American squatter against a fellow-squatter's bowie knife. Lynch law was openly proclaimed by them to the death. The company indulged in scandal vile enough some times, but still it was to expedite a glittering innuendo, to warrant a shrewd judgment.

At a reasonably early hour the buckram-skirted coats, and gowns ' all of a curl,' vanished to some later drum, or rout, or turn at Ranelagh. The mistress of the house sat alone among her patches and paste, and the lass dedications which had solicited her patronage and crowned her with reflected honour. As she leant back in her chair, and held up her thin foot to the fire, the writing on a humble letter addressed to her, caught her eye. She touched her hand-bell for her weary woman, Betty. ' Did Master Giles or his sister call again to-day?' ' Yes, my lady,' answered Betty, sparing in her words ; never gossiping when she could help it, with that cold, brilliant mistress. ' Well, well, they will call again to-morrow, like the newsman, or the chairman, or the linkman, or any other attentive servant' ' No,' escaped from Betty's lips, half unawares. 'And why not, mistress?' demanded her lady sharply. ' Because he said he had given up his poetry, and was gone back to his apprenticeship, and she told me she had got a place for herself as nursery-maid at the squire's.' ' Fools,' declared the patroness, scornfully, ' and this is all their gentle breeding has brought them to ?

' If it please your ladyship, he could not bear to have his poor verses cut up any longer, when he only craved a simple opinion on their merits. Instead of that, he had them served back to him minced into morsels, and drenched with pepper and vinegar.

' You are a Queen of Sheba, my girl.

Now I would be very far from suggesting to any one, especially to a young girl, to magnify the little vexations which are around her. But, as to the annoyances which stick to us, those which aie undeniably our own, and attend us like privileged duns or pests, week after week, month aster month, I would ask a girl to accept them as her visible, present cross. I do not believe many of us (we may be thankful for it) are called upon, except it be at intervals, to carry a great, heavy cross of faint ness or anguish. Our crosses are more what we are disposed to treat as worries ; to be very unceremonious in pettishly grum bling at ; resisting hotly ; and shaking off angrily when we can.

It is very different, too, from accepting the evil as at least a part of her cross, laid upon her by her Father, who cannot err, who will remove it in his own good time ; ' ease her shoulder from bearing the pots,' or so strengthen that shoulder that the weight will no more be felt, but will diminish into a mere straw balanced on its old resting-place. Yes, yes, the fact of our cross appointed for us with out our own wist is an incalculable advantage, though our poor eyes may be holden not to see it. If we were left to determine our own temptations and afflictions, what mistakes we should commit !
