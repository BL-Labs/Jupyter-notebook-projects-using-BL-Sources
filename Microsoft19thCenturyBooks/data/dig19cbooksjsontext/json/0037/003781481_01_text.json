In Britain's isle, and Arthur's days, When midnight fairies daunced the maze, Lived Edwin of the Green ; Edwin, I wis, a gentle youth, Endow 'd with courage, sense, and truth, Though badly shaped he been. His mountain back mote well be said so measure height against his head. And lift itself above ; set, spite of all that Nature did I'o make his uncouth form forbid, J This creature dared to love. He felt the charms of Edith's eyes, Nor wanted hope to gain the prize, Could ladies look within ; But one Sir Topaz dress'd with art, And isa shape could win a heart. He had a shape to win. Edwin, if right I read my song, With slighted passion paced along. All in the moony light ; 'Twas near an old enchanted court, ' Where sportive fairies made resort To revel out the night. iVl"], [94, "His heart was drear his hope was cross'd, Twas late, 'twas far, the path was lost That reach'd the neighbour town ; With wear}- steps he quits the shades, Resolved, the darkling dome he treads, And drops his limbs adown. But scant he lays him on the floor. When hollow winds remove the door, And trembling rocks the ground : And, well I ween to count aright. At once a hundred tapers light On all the walls around. Now sounding tongues assail his ear. Now sounding feet approachen near. And now the sounds increase : Anil from the corner where he lay, He sees a train profusely gay Come prankling o'er the place. But (trust me, gentles !) never yet Was dight a masking half so neat, Or half so rich before ; The country lent the sweet perfumes. The sea the pearl, the sky the plumes, The town its silken store. Now whilst he gazed, a gallant, drest In flaunting robes above the rest, With awful accent cried, \" What mortal of a wretched mind. Whose sighs infect the balmy wind, Has here presumed to hide ?\" At this the swain, whose venturous soul No fears of magic art control, Advanced in open sight ; \" Nor have I cause of dread,\" he said, \" Who view, by no presumption led. Your revels of the night. 'Twas grief for scorn of faithful love, Which made my steps unweeting rove Amid the nightly dew.\" \" 'Tis well,\" the gallant cries again, 1,4 We fairies never injure men Who dare to tell us true. Exalt thy love-dejected heart ; Be mine the task, or ere we part, To make thee grief resign ; Xow take the pleasure of thy chaunce ; Whilst I with Mab, my partner, daunce. Be little Mabel thine.\" He spoke, and all a sudden there Light music floats in wanton air ; The monarch leads the queen : The rest their fairy partners found; And Mabel trimly trips the ground With Edwin of the Green. The dauncing past, the hoard was laid, And siker such a feast was made As heart and lip desire ; Withouten hands the dishes fly, The glasses with a wish come nigh, And with a wish retire. But now, to please the fairy king, Full every deal they laugh and sing. And antic feats devise ; Some wind and tumble like an ape, And other some transmute their shape In Edwin's wondering eyes.

And heard a cock to crow ; The whirling wind that bore the crowd Has clapp'd the doi>r, and whistled loud, To warn them all to go. Then, screaming, all at once they fly. And all at once the tapers die ; Poor Edwin falls to floor; Forlorn his state, and dark the place ; Was never wight in such a case Through all the land before. But soon as Dan Apollo rose, Full jolly creature home he goes, He feels his back the less ; His honest tongue and steady mind Had rid him of the lump behind, Which made him want success. With lusty livelyhed he talks, He seems a dancing as he walks ; His story soon took wind ; And beauteous Edith sees the youth Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth, Without a bunch behind. The story told. Sir Topaz moved, The youth of Edith erst approved, To see the revel scene : At close of eve he leaves his home, And wends to find the ruin'd dome All on the gloomv plain. 83"], [96, "As there he bides, it so befel, The wind came rustling down a dell. A shaking seized the wall ; Up spring the tapers as before. The fairies bragly foot the floor. And music fills the hall. But, certes, sorely sunk with woe. Sir Topaz sees the elfin show, His spirits in him die : When Oberon cries, \" A man is near, A mortal passion, cleped fear, Hangs flagging in the sky.\" With that Sir Topaz, hapless youth ! In accents faultering, ay for ruth, Intreats them pity grant ; For als he been a mister wight, Betray'd, by wandering in the night. To tread the circled haunt. \" A losell vile,\" at once they roar ; \" And little skill'd of fairy lore, Thy cause to come we know : Now has thy kestrel courage fell ; And fairies, since a lie you tell, Are free to work thee woe.\" Then Will, who bears the wispy fire To trail the swains among the mire, The caitiff upward flung ; There, like a tortoise in a shop, He dangled from the chamber top, Where whilome Edwin hung. The revel now proceeds apace, Deftly they frisk it o'er the place, . They sit, they drink, and eat ; The time with frolic mirth beguile. And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while Till all the rout retreat. By this the stars began to wink, They shriek, they fly, the tapers sink, And down y-drops the knight : For never spell by fairy laid With strong enchantment bound a glade Beyond the length of night. Chill, dark, alone, adreed, he lay. Till up the welkin rose the day, Then deem'd the dole was o'er : But wot ye well his harder lot ? His seely back the bunch had got Which Edwin lost afore.
