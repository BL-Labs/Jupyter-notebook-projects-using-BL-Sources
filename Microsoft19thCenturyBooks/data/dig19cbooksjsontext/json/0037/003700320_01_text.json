He was a familiar figure on the platform, a person to be readily recognised and to be treated with due respect as the chief landowner of the district. He was an elderly man, not hale and active for his sixty years ; his close-cut hair was white, his complexion was sallow instead of ruddy. His overcoat was buttoned up after the fashion in which a man might guard himself from a bitter wintry blast, and not from a mere April sting, in which there was an admixture of balm. He stooped as he walked, and used a stick to help him in the slight lameness which chronic gout had made permanent. The station-master and the few people who were A"], [14, "2 RACHEL LANGTON about rather wondered to see Mr Langton alone, or only attended by the servant in livery, waiting on the platform at a respectful distance, while out side the station the Langton carriage was drawn up. Of late years the squire had seldom gone abroad unattended by his daughter, or by his sole surviving son \u2014 that is, when Mr Arthur was not at college. In addition there was some speculation as to what could bring Mr Langton to the station when the time was close to his dinner-hour, for the family at the Hall were old-fashioned and conser vative in their habits, and still dined at seven. Such speculation, if known to its object, did not seem to disturb him as he walked leisurely up and down with his hands behind his back, and peered from under his white eyelashes at the closed daisies on the railway bank, and the wallflowers and polyanthuses in the station-master's garden. He was a man slow to receive an impression, and equally slow to let it go \u2014 an autocrat in his way, and yet an autocrat with a sense of his own im potency. For he had been over-mastered by cir cumstances, or the will of Providence, and forced to submit and make the best of misfortunes for which he had no mind. Mr Langton was full of troubled thoughts, with more pain than pleasure in them. He was recalling the memory of his two dead sons, who, in the course of nature, ought to have survived him. Neither of the two had been what fathers, like the squire, con-"], [15, "THE MEETING AT THE RAILWAY STATION 3 sider satisfactory. Richard, the heir, who had died last, only a few months before, so that the squire still wore mourning for him, had been thoroughlyself ish and dissipated, and more or less alienated from his family ever since he grew up. Gerald, the second son, though not exactly a mauvais suj'et, had been a vexation in other ways. He had been thoughtless and improvident ; he had contracted an unsuitable marriage, and had died on the eve of starting for one of the colonies, leaving a penniless widow with a baby, on whose account, as being of his own flesh and blood, the squire had felt bound to continue the allowance originally granted to the father. And, for the first time since it was given, the annual sum had been punctually acknowledged and as far as the donor knew, never exceeded in the receiver's expenses. Mrs Gerald was an entire stranger to her husband's family. Even his death had not drawn her and them nearer. The squire had been prevented by illness from attending his son's deathbed, as in other circumstances he would not have failed to do ; and Arthur had happened to be abroad. Richard had always managed to avoid trying scenes, till the last one of all came to him, without the choice of sparing himself. For any thing further it had not occurred to Mr Langton to send his only daughter in the room of the men of the family. Thus Mrs Gerald had been suffered to become a widow, as she had been allowed to be made a wife, without the support of her husband's"], [16, "4 RACHEL LANGTON kindred. She might have remained an absolute stranger had it not been for Richard Langton's death, which greatly altered the position of his nephew, and, through the child, that of his mother. Gerald's child of four years had become the old squire's heir-at-law. It was necessary that he should be brought forward and educated according to his prospects. Mr Langton did not hesitate on that point, though, with his usual deliberation, it took him several months to make the various arrangements which ended in his being at Langton railway station, awaiting the arrival of his daughter in-law and her child. The two were to become, whatever the incongruities of the situation, per manently resident under his roof. Mrs Gerald had not denied the squire's claim on the child, or declined to come with him to the Hall, but she had not shown any greater alacrity in acceding to the request than Mrs Langton had displayed in making it. The whole thing was a dry and formal yielding to necessity, and to doing the best which could be done under the circumstances. Mr Langton anticipated no pleasure from mak ing his daughter-in-law's acquaintance, a perform ance which was decidedly awkward at this late date. He had settled in his own mind from the first, that she must be a forward, designing young woman who had taken advantage of Gerald's credu lity and carelessness. He had slightly modified his bad opinion of her, so as to attribute to her some"], [17, "THE MEETING AT THE RAILWAY STATION 5 common sense and good taste when she had neither intruded on him personally nor made any attempt to extract a larger income from him during the three years of her widowhood. This was so far well, but it was not much, and Mr Langton had decided to bear the first brunt of the meeting alone. He would not suffer either his son Arthur or his daughter Agatha to accompany him to the station. He would have no more witnesses than he could help to the effort he was making, and to his inevit able recoil from it. He had always been a re served man, and of late years the tendency had acquired a tinge of morbid shyness. He did not even look forward with great hope to assuming the guardianship of his first and only grandchild. He had got out of touch with chil dren. He felt as if this one would only plague him in his ailing age. Mr Langton was doing his duty \u2014 an unpalatable duty \u2014 that was all. As he walked slowly up and down the platform, holding himself aloof from his neighbours, it oc curred to him all at once, that he might have some difficulty in identifying his relatives. It would be decidedly unpleasant for him to have to hail a suc cession of unprotected females, utter strangers, with a set form of inquiry, \u2014 ' Have I the pleasure of addressing Mrs Gerald Langton ? ' For aught that he knew there might be more than one young widow (Mrs Gerald was not older than Agatha) with a little child in her care in the train."], [18, "6 RACHEL LANGTON Let him see, it was little more than three years since the death of his son Gerald \u2014 long enough time, in these days, for a widow to have cast aside every atom of her weeds ; and this widow was just the sort of woman, according to her father-in-law's estimate, to have flung them off, on the first excuse, in order to set herself out for another husband. The squire put out his nether lip with a movement of strong disgust, as he indulged in the gratuitously offensive supposition. She was so far a lady, to be sure, at least her father had held the profession of a gentleman. But there are shades and degrees in the profession of a gentleman. From a few inquiries which Mr Langton had considered it incumbent on him to make at the time of his son's marriage, he had learned that the future Mrs Gerald's father, though entitled to call himself a clergyman of the Church of England, had never risen in the ecclesi astical ranks beyond the grade of a curate. As for the income of his curacy, it had been so inadequate to the wants of a large family, that his eldest daughter had gone out as a governess, and taken pupils, in order that her salary might supplement her father's. At this moment the bell rang, and the train, with a rush, ran up to the platform. Mr Langton, who belonged properly to the old coaching and posting days, was a little startled and confused by the noise and hurry. He drew back and waited for a moment."], [19, "THE MEETING AT THE RAILWAY STATION 7 After all there were not many passengers to Langton, and not one stepped out of a first-class carriage. Had the woman missed the train ? a woman's trick, but not the less objectionable on that account. Had he overlooked anybody ? His eyes were not so good as they had been, and he was put about, naturally. No, there was certainly no such little group as he had pictured. Stay, there was a widow by her dress, a young woman carrying a big child in her arms, who, in spite of the encumbrance, stepped lightly out of a third-class carriage, and after a swift glance round, advanced straight to him. ' I am Rachel Langton,' she said quietly. Her face was pale, but she did not falter. ' My luggage is in the luggage-van next the engine \u2014 a porter is putting it out. I think you are Mr Langton. I am sorry, sir, that you have had the trouble of coming to meet me.' ' Not at all,' he said, with stiff gravity. ' Here, Rollaston,' calling to his man, 'see after Mrs Gerald Langton's luggage. It is addressed, I pre sume ? Take my arm, madam. I am distressed that I cannot relieve you from the burden of the child. Where is his servant ? What ! ' he ejacul ated, in dismayed response to the look on her face, ' you do not mean that you have come all this distance without one? Travelled from the north of England by yourself, and had the boy on your hands all the way ?' The squire spoke more"], [20, "8 RACHEL LANGTON in surprise than in anger, though there was a mix ture of the two feelings in his voice. ' I thought it better not to bring a maid-servant,' she said, in the same clear calm tone, which had little self-assertion in it, and was the reverse of clamor ous ; yet Mr Langton felt, in the middle of his bewilderment and displeasure, it would be difficult to put the speaker down. ' She might not have suited here. Besides we had only one at Hares gill. I have been accustomed to have the boy with me, constantly and I am strong. I do not mind his weight.' Then she smiled a slightly depreca tory smile. ' I have always travelled third-class before, and I am afraid it did not strike me till I had started that you might not like your grandson to arrive in such a fashion.' ' If he was with his mother it was all right,' muttered Mr Langton, with old-fashioned but freezing politeness. She looked strong, in spite of her figure, which, though tall, was slight, and in spite of the absence of colour in her cheeks. She was a well-knit woman with reserves of health \u2014 not flaunted at you in crim son buxomness, but filling you with conviction, as it showed out of her clear, grey eyes, her wavy, abundant brown hair, and the firm, rounded contour of her pale face. Mrs Gerald was not at all what the squire had imagined ; he saw that at a glance. He had to begin all over again in his contemplation of the"], [21, "THE MEETING AT THE RAILWAY STATION 9 relations which he proposed to establish between them. He could not say that he was disappointed, but he could not readily accommodate himself to new ideas. He was not helped by the presence of the child, who was hanging on his mother's shoulder half asleep and wholly bashful. Certainly his mother did not obtrude the boy on his grandfather's notice, become voluble over his attractions, or melt over a fancied resemblance to his dead father, as one might have expected ; though, for that matter, so far as Mr Langton could see the child's face, he was more like his mother than his father. It was what some people would call a whey face, with a square chin and a baby mouth more straight than pouting, under his very plain hat. There was one point of similarity between the squire and his daughter-in-law which was not enough in itself to cause them to relax to each other, which indeed was rather against relaxation. They were both formal \u2014 a peculiarity more striking in a young woman than in an old man. She had deliberately addressed him as 'Sir,' just as he had been surprised into addressing her as ' Madam.' He insisted on handing her into the carriage, notwithstanding his lameness and the obstacle of the child in her arms. The couple sat down in opposite corners, looked out of opposite windows, and appeared prepared, if they spoke at all, to start"], [22, "10 RACHEL LANGTON a stereotyped conversation on the weather, the penalties of travelling, the time at which the tra vellers ought to arrive at the Hall, as if the speakers had not another source of interest in common."], [23, "CHAPTER II STRANGERS OF ONE HOUSEHOLD ' There they come,' cried Arthur and Agatha Langton in one voice, as they saw from the great old oriel window of the drawing-room the car riage coming up the avenue. He was but a pleasant, cheery - looking lad of two-and-twenty ; she was a beautiful woman, six years older. She had been practically mistress of the house since her mother's death, before Agatha left the schoolroom, and she had been a second mother to Arthur, who adored her. In her perfectly-fitting black cash mere morning gown, she was a dainty, dark-eyed little creature, with a suppleness of motion and grace of gesture which were excellent substitutes for the willowy elegance or the stately majesty of a tall or a large-limbed woman. She was more distinguished by her exceedingly gentle and gracious manners, than by a strong mind, or an original intellect. She had all the culture and refinement of long generations centred in her, with the attractions and advantages of such cul ture, together with its limitations. She was a product of the highest civilisation, thoroughly un- n"], [24, "12 RACHEL LANGTON affected, winning in every way, and dearly loved by those who knew her best, all the more so be cause they were conscious that they had cost her a great sacrifice \u2014 against which she had never murmured. ' Poor old governor,' said Arthur, as the brother and sister proceeded to the porch to meet the guests, ' he must have had a bad quarter of an hour. And, upon my word, I do not know if he is the more to be pitied of the two. It cannot have been agreeable for her either, though it may be true that she ought not to have married Gerald. A woman and a stranger \u2014 a widow \u2014 poor old Gerry's widow \u2014 the mother of an unlucky little fatherless kid.' ' An unlucky little kid that will oust you and me, Attie,' said Agatha, with a slightly reproach ful shake of the head, but she added with instant candour, ' I don't mean to say he is not entitled to do it. I am not going to complain of his prior claim, poor little mortal. I intend to look upon him from the first as the future head of the house, my small king, the king-to-be of all of us. He is our brother's child \u2014 all that is left to us of Gerald \u2014 of Dick, too, when it comes to that. I propose, as the Americans say, to be real right down fond of that child.' ' He is his mother's child, as well as Gerald's ; you are not going to forget that,' he reminded her, shrewdly."], [25, "STRANGERS OF ONE HOUSEHOLD 13 ' I suspect I sha'n't be able,' answered Agatha, with the faintest discontented sigh \u2014 suppressed the next instant. ' I shall have to ask her permis sion to be fond of him ; but I will do it, never fear, dear, she shall have her due.' ' I don't doubt it, Sis,' said Arthur, with affec tionate conviction. There was no more said till the carriage drove up. The moment it stopped, the brother and sister were ready with their greetings. ' Here you are,' cried Arthur, heartily, thrusting forward his closely-cropped brown head. ' Let me help you out, and bid you welcome to Lang ton.' ' How are you, Rachel ? How tired you must be. I hope the little man has not fretted,' said Agatha's soft voice. And both speeches were made with perfect sincerity. ' Thank you, I am not at all knocked up, and Caleb has behaved quite as well as could be expected,' Mrs Gerald replied quietly. The squire could not help making a wry face behind the speaker's back. He had known the child's name of course, but when he heard it spoken he realised more strongly that there had never been a Caleb before among the Reginalds, Basils and Arthurs on the title-roll of the Langtons of Langton Hall. Yet surely the world-wide fame of the son of Jehhunneh, whose name, as Mr Langton understood, had been borne by Mrs"], [26, "14 RACHEL LANGTON Gerald's father, far outshone the local glory of any Langton of them all. Arthur and Agatha received a shock from the meeting similar to that which the squire had ex perienced on his introduction to Gerald's widow, though their anticipations had been vague, and, on the whole, more charitable. They were of young England and recognised a greater variety of young women with a greater diversity of aims than were summed up in the squire's circumscribed list. Virtually it resolved itself into two broad, easily classed definitions. There was the modest, un assuming young woman who adorned, by the per formance of her duty, the sphere in which she was born, and was content to remain in it. And there was the bold, aggressive young woman who pushed herself into circles with which she was not familiar, and brazened out her success in the faces of the outraged members of those circles. Mrs Gerald's perfect self-possession, her air as of one who stood there, fearless in her self-defence, with a certain dry, almost dogged, irresponsiveness to their advances, took her new brother and sister aback. She entered the hall, still carrying the half-asleep child, whom she had not given up in answer to any of their overtures. As the light of the lamps, already lit, fell full upon mother and child, it showed that she continued to wear a widow's dress in its utmost rigour, though of plain, inex pensive materials. Her crape veil, thrown back"], [27, "STRANGERS OF ONE HOUSEHOLD 15 over her shoulders, helped to frame a strong face \u2014 very handsome but for a rigidity of line, and a suspicion of bloodlessness in the pallor which bore no other sign of unhealthiness. It was neither a coarse nor a weak type of face. ' She ought to have known better than to marry out of her rank,' thought Agatha with lightning quickness. ' What description of woman is she ? ' flashed across Arthur's plastic mind. ' As stunning as Sis in a different way ; but what is her way ? Not that of a tragedy queen \u2014 a world too simple and sensible looking for that \u2014 rather the incarnation of common sense, with a dash of enthusiasm or fanaticism somewhere. She can be as stern as Fate, I take it. I'm a little bit sorry for the small chap who is her property, in the first place.' The light in the hall with its deers' antlers, dark pictures, and two mysterious black figures holding lamps, the crowd of strange faces \u2014 their number indefinitely increased by those of of the servants hovering in the background, all were too much for the child. He began to wink violently, his lips quivered, and he clutched his chubby arms round his mother's bent neck. ' Caleb, I'm ashamed of you \u2014 a big boy of four years old. You must not cry, I am here,' she told him in short, preremptory sentences, and the pre liminary stage of a wail came to a sudden conclusion. ' Oh ! you must both be worn out,' cried Agatha,"], [28, "16 RACHEL LANGTON looking really distressed at a form of suffering she could not assuage. 'What had you rather do \u2014 come straight into the drawing-room and have a cup of tea, or shall I send it up to your room, and then you can lie down before dinner? But first, do trust me with the darling, indeed, I shall take the greatest care of him, and you are not fit to carry him upstairs.' ' Oh ! yes I am, a great deal fitter than you are,' said Mrs Gerald, glancing with the ghost of a smile at Agatha's dainty proportions. The speaker had no rudeness, only a lingering frosti ness in her tone. There was certainly earnestness, almost piteous earnestness, in her assurance as she went on, ' I do trust you, Miss Langton, but the child has been accustomed to his mother waiting upon him. If you will excuse us this one evening, when everything and everybody are new to him, if I may put him to bed, and stay with him \u2014 though he is not easily frightened \u2014 he will be all right to-morrow night.' ' Oh dear ! yes,' cried Agatha and Arthur simul taneously, while the squire in the background mumbled his acquiescence. ' Do exactly what you like,' Agatha continued with her natural sweet graciousness. ' You are at home, remember. We shall be very sorry to lose your company, oi course, but it is only a pleasure deferred. What we should like best is that you and this pet should make yourselves perfectly comfortable. Just one"], [29, "STRANGERS OF ONE HOUSEHOLD \u25a07 thing, Rachel,' in accents of gentle reproach, ' not \" Miss Langton,\" \" Agatha,\" we are sisters.' ' Yes, Agatha, thank you for your kindness.' It was said with a sort of responsive graciousness, but the concession was neither spontaneous nor cordial. It was a more dignified graciousness even than Agatha's ; and while the unmarried woman's dignity was totally unconscious and was balanced by her invincible gentleness, the married woman\u2014 whatever independence of character she possessed, was dignified advisedly, as an additional precaution in her position. The three Langtons looked questioningly at each other when they, by one consent, repaired to the drawing-room for a few minutes, before separating to dress for dinner. ' I am afraid she will turn out an impracticable, troublesome person, who will never see what the boy's station requires, or that I am doing the best I can for him,' said the squire, gloomily. ' It is a great deal too early to judge \u2014 is it not, father ? ' said Agatha, the consoler ; ' at least she is evidently devoted to her son. She will soon be able to understand what is best in his interest. She does not look stupid, and she is an educated woman. Apart from that, one must always rever ence a mother's affection, even though it assert itself injudiciously. ' I told you so, Attie,' Agatha said in confidence to her brother on the first opportunity. ' She has p"], [30, "18 RACHEL LANGTON no conception of the ordinary usages of society. The idea of declining my father's company, and excusing herself, on the first occasion of our dining enfamille, that she might put the child to bed with her own hands, because he was accustomed to her doing it ! All mothers would like to do it, I dare say, but they have to restrain their inclinations, when the mothers are above the grade of working people. It is an office which Gerald's wife, or widow, ought never to have taken upon herself, she owed it to him to refrain. How could she fulfil the task, consistently with her duty to Gerald, and to such guests as they must have intended to receive, some time, surely, even in Otago or Queensland ? ' ' Poor mother,' said Arthur, hastily. Mrs Gerald had been a woman brought up in a hard school, in which there were no superfluities, while the very necessaries of life were at all times barely supplied, and were frequently wanting. She had known from earliest girlhood the pinching hardships and sore affronts of genteel poverty, the harassing struggle to make both ends meet, the haunting, wearing anxiety for the future. Under these burdens her father, a good though neither an enterprising nor a prudent man, had ultimately sunk, overborne by work, insufficient rest and nourishment, and never absent care. She had possessed, for a time, youth's immunity to the worst part of the family troubles, but she had seen their effects on her father and her invalid mother,"], [31, "STRANGERS OF ONE HOUSEHOLD 19 until at last she had been drawn within the vortex, and the iron had entered into her soul. If she had not been from girlhood deeply religious, as her father had been before her, her strong nature would probably have been embittered with an extreme measure of the cynicism, which is so striking an element of the life of this generation. As it was, she was simply grave and stern, neither bitter nor sour. She had fought so long with the hard primi tive realities of life, that its silken obligations, its fine lights and shades, its elaborate forms and ceremonies, its sentimental grievances and imagin ary woes, either did not exist for her, or were viewed by her as indifferently as if they did not exist. She was aware that she had not been fit to enter a world which set great store on observances, precedents and traditions, a large part of whose daily serious duties would have been wholly imma terial to a working man or woman honestly labour ing to fill children's hungry mouths, and clothe their shivering backs. Rachel Langton was not only essentially a high minded woman, she was technically well educated. She knew more of music and painting than Agatha knew, though neither of the women was a born musi cian or artist. Mrs Gerald was more thoroughly acquainted with English history and literature, more grammatically accurate, though less colloquially fluent in French and German. She had sat at rich men's tables, in a subordinate place, to be sure, yet,"], [32, "20 RACHEL LANGTON perhaps, because of the subordination^ else because she was so full of other and what appeared to her far more important things than the trifles for which she could not care a straw, she was supremely ignoranton the thousand points connected with the savoir vivre and savoir faire of the class to which her husband belonged. She could not tell, and it was a matter of utmost indifference to her, what person ought tobe the first to enter and to leave in a room full of com pany. She did not know one wine glass from another, which might be of less consequence, since she never drank wine. She blundered unblushingly between fish and fruit knives and forks. In her father's house, as she would have coolly explained to anyone who cared to listen, there had been no such accessories. She did not eat peas with a knife, or swallow soup noisily, but she dropped her table-napkin, and forgot to use her finger-glass, while her sister - in - law looked on with gentle wonder and distress, and the servants were shocked. Mrs Gerald was unacquainted with any farther colours for horses than black, brown and white ; she could not distinguish a landau from a brougham, while it did not serve to account altogether for her obliviousness, that she had never been taught to ride and disliked driving. She called the coats of the gentleman of the hunt, when she men tioned them at all, ' red,' not ' pink.' She could not even put a letter into an envelope according to incontrovertible rules. She was puzzled to make"], [33, "STRANGERS OF ONE HOUSEHOLD 21 out how all Agatha's busy days and fully occupied nights were spent when she was not in attendance on her father waiting on him with filial tenderness. Why must she spend hours arranging the flowers for the drawing - room, and the dining - table ? What obligation was there on her to take that drive, the carriage coming to the door as regularly as clockwork ; or ride that ride, the groom appearing as punctually on the scene as the coachman ; or write those piles of merely polite notes, or read the club books which she did not care for, or embroider that elaborate piece of work which would be out of fashion almost before the embroidery was finished. The whole engrossing round of engagements seemed to Rachel such a foolish waste of time and trouble, when all was done. She would not have her boy grow up a busy idler, an animated trifler, the chief end of his being, after he had gone to college and taken his degree by an effort, and served for a year or two in a crack regiment during the piping times of peace, to settle down as a_ country gentleman, and prove a keen sportsman, a successful agri culturist and a tolerable magistrate. She had cherished a very different ambition for her little lad, and though, alas ! it was likely to be largely baulked by the inopportune death, without heirs, of his uncle Richard, she was by no means disposed to relinquish her views for her son, in their entirety."], [34, "22 CHAPTER I II 'OUT OF HER ELEMENT' Mrs Gerald was sensible enough that she had better not have married so far above her in rank, as was implied in the bridegroom's being even the younger son of a squire like Mr Langton. But if her marriage had been a grave blunder, it was also the great romance of her life, the one event which had carried her out of herself, and rendered her, for some enchanted months, as deeply entranced and brightly glad as Caleb, grave at his little tasks, was apt to be at his play. She could not bear, candid and straightforward as she was, to own that it was all a mistake. Now she pined for the work to which she had been brought up, not pretty fancy work, or the exercise of elegant accomplishments, but good, honest, hard work. It was as necessary to her as daily bread. She felt as if she could not preserve her identity, go on living, and continue in health without it. But all that Rachel could do for herself in this respect was to sit a great deal in her room, and occupy herself in making"], [35, "' OUT OF HER ELEMENT 23 her own clothes and the child's \u2014 not without a bitter sense that this also was a make-believe, for were not the materials provided for her ? Was she not taking some poor dressmaker's work out of her hands ? Naturally Agatha did nothing for her own or her neighbour's clothes, any more than she scoured the floors, or cooked the dinner. Nevertheless this resource, and that of undertaking the plainest of the charity work \u2014 a discreet pro portion of which was sent over from the Rectory to be accomplished at the Hall, formed Mrs Gerald's great refuge. But she did not know enough of the position, she had been too long accustomed to have to work for herself, to fall readily into working for others, and making it the business of her life to- Teach the orphan boy to read, And teach the orphan girl to sew,' even if the Board School had not stepped in to occupy the field. The one common meeting ground between Mrs Gerald and the Langtons generally, and Agatha in particular, was the child which belonged to them all. The mother never lost sight of the fact that he was her boy. She would claim the first right, along with the squire, even before the squire, in the little lad's rearing. It was her deep primary responsibility, even more than her strong love, which wrought with her, for there was no"], [36, "RACHEL LANGTON 24 grasping appropriation, no petty jealousy in her motherhood. She looked into Agatha's eyes \u2014 always full of fondness for children, and hungering as a childless woman's eyes will hunger over this special child, her nephew, her dead brother's son, her father's heir, with all the possibilities which the mere fact of his existence might hold for her, in the future. And when Mrs Gerald realised the wistful longing in her sister-in-law's face, she smiled her comparatively rare, grave but singularly honest smile, and let Agatha have her heart's content of the boy, only interfering when there was a risk of his being what the mother considered coddled and over-indulged. It did not occur to Rachel that anybody could displace her in the child's affections, or that it would matter supposing it could be. A result which could hardly have been calculated upon beforehand, was that the one person at Langton Hall between whom and Mrs Gerald there appeared to exist a mutual attraction, who was irresistibly drawn' to her as she was to him> turned out to be the light-hearted undergraduate Arthur, and he seemed no sooner to have finished his Easter holidays than he was back again for his long vacation. He was still faithful in his boyish allegiance to his sister Agatha, as the per fect mould of woman, at the same time he had a wide and elastic standard for women and chil dren, and this woman was ' old Gerald's ' widow,"], [37, "'OUT OF HER ELEMENT 25 and little Caleb's mother. She must be lonely, poor soul, though she made no show of her loneli- ness ; she was not Sis's sort, so that it was not Sis's fault when she could make nothing of the new- comer; besides, Sis was so much taken up with waiting on the poor old governor. It might cheer up Rachel to be talked to a bit, and if she did not like it, she could send him about his business, without ceremony. They were brother and sister, when it came to that, and she was at least as much older than he, as Agatha was. Besides, Rachel being a widow, and the mother of a big boy of four, fit to be put into knickerbockers, rendered her a Methuselah among women compared to twenty two years' old, Arthur. His head was crammed full of his sports and his boating rather than of his classes, though he was to be the Rector of Langton, which was held for him by a clerical friend till he should take his degree and be ordained. Rachel's room was the largest, pleasantest, most luxurious room she had ever occupied ; indeed, so pleasant and luxurious that it was some time before she could feel herself at home in it, and when she did she took herself to task, and told herself severely she was growing a Sybarite. What was her mother's room, what were her sister's rooms in comparison ? It was really almost a comfort to her to feel that she would have sickened there, both in mind and body, without work. That"], [38, "26 RACHEL LANGTON room of Mrs Gerald's was on the ground floor, and now that it was the height of summer, she would open the French windows \u2014 the windows were French on that side of the house, and sit working behind the Madras muslin curtains. Arthur Langton, striding across the lawn to the tennis-court or the stables, whistling like a lark, as he had a habit of whistling, would catch a glimpse of his sister-in-law, turn aside, sit down on the window sill, and begin to tell her his news. He described how the young partridges were looking, he enlarged on the trout which he meant to catch for to-morrow's breakfast. He made her acquainted with the important facts that a cricket match was to be held at West bridge on Saturday, and that he proposed run ning up to town the following week to see what was going on at Lords. Her brothers' lives had been filled with much work and little play, after their few friends had, by a desperate scramble, secured for them an education not altogether unbefitting the sons of a clergyman. After all, most of the lads had been reduced to emigrate, and convert them selves into store-keepers, stockmen and shepherds in what were still the wilds of British America and Australia, so glutted was the professional market at home. Her sisters were passing the greater part of their fast-fleeting youth in the monotonous drudgery of various schoolrooms,"], [39, "' OUT OF HER ELEMENT ' 27 warerooms and offices. The two last destina tions were a modern improvement on the first, for, by stooping to enter great dressmaking and millinery establishments, or by having the enter prise to qualify themselves for copying-clerks and post-office clerks, the girls had a small chance given them of making a slender provision, or of securing a small retiring allowance for old age. Their mother, worn out before she had reached middle age, had found a refuge in a charitable institution for clergymen's widows, where she was allowed the boon of one daughter to bear her company. Yet Rachel, stitching as if for daily bread, listened with some sympathy \u2014 she was careful to explain it was ignorant sympathy \u2014 to Arthur's chat. The boy was like what his brother Gerald had been when she encountered him first. To have him sitting there giving her his confidence, recalled associations which, however far removed from her now, still thrilled her with their pathetic sweetness. Sometimes he persuaded her to ac company him, with Caleb perched gleefully on his uncle's shoulder, to the kitchen garden and the or chard, that the child might gather late strawberries and gooseberries, creeping and tumbling about among the bushes. Sometimes Caleb was held up, much elated by the situation, to pluck the last cherries and the first pears and apples for his mother and his small self from the trees, which"], [40, "28 RACHEL LANGTON were called, to this day, 'Master Richard's' and ' Master Gerald's,' ' Miss Langton's ' and ' Master Arthur's trees,' because they had been originally planted on the first of the respective birthdays of the squire's sons and daughter. Then the boy, still more impressed, was formally intro duced to the thriving sapling, which had been planted in due form only a short while ago, and was to be known thenceforth as ' Master Caleb's tree.' After the child was in bed, Mrs Gerald, who had declined to relegate to a servant the duty of hearing him say his prayers, would come into the drawing-room before the gong sounded for dinner. She was uniformly dressed in her widow's dress, which admitted, in her eyes, of no adorn ment, and did not afford any opportunity for variety. Its unrelieved sombreness presented the greatest contrast to Agatha's toilet, which was meant to be studiously quiet, but her mourn ing for her brother Dick, decreasing by a pre scribed sliding scale, had arrived at a mildly cheer ful, and what looked to Rachel's unaccustomed eyes a positively gay stage. Agatha wore white evening dresses just sobered by black ribbons, she had white or scarlet flowers at her throat or in her bosom, and pearls round her neck and wrists. Agatha would have held it an act of unbecoming sloth \u2014 akin to slovenliness, a proof of lack of self-respect, and a deficient sense of"], [41, "'OUT OF HER ELEMENT' 29 what was due to her father and brother, had she not dressed carefully for the family and for her self every evening, though there were no guests to benefit by her efforts. Certainly the beautiful, refined image which she presented for Mr Langton's and Arthur's contemplation, satisfied and gratified them. Poor Mr Langton's dress coat was not very festive, but Arthur's expanse of spotless shirt front and his diamond studs might have graced a ball-room. Arthur would coax and beguile Mrs Gerald, if there were but five minutes to spare, to go with him into the verandah or out into the shrubbery, as she feared the evening dew no more than the noon day dust, to look at the planet Jupiter, or the glow-worms, or the hutch of guinea-pigs he had got for Caleb's delectation. He would lionise her by moonlight, since she was apt to be en gaged in the sunshine, and descant glibly on the beauties of the Hall, which was of all ages and styles, mellowed into a delightfully harmonious whole; while she would be thinking of her father's tall, narrow, brick and plaster house, run up cheaply, in an inferior suburb of a manu facturing town. There was but one subject on which Mrs Gerald felt forced to quarrel with her brother - in - law. She could not stand a statement which, without thinking, he made frequently. ' I shall do so and so,' he would give out, ' deepen and widen the"], [42, "30 RACHEL LANGTON great pond and make it really decent skating ground in winter, or plant a row of mulberry trees the moment the filbert bushes are used up, when I am installed in the Rectory. You know I was born Rector of Langton, and I keep an eye on my future territory.' ' How can you say such a thing ? ' she would turn upon him with a gasp of pain and indigna tion. ' Do you know the calling of a clergyman is the noblest, the most tremendous a man can undertake, with his eyes open. Shall I tell you what my father thought about it ? He was articled to a solicitor who had an excellent practice, and took a special interest in his clerk, so that, as the solicitor had no son to succeed him, my father's prospects were considered very good. But there came upon him such a sense of the needs of the world, such a longing for a cure of souls to which he might devote his life if he were but found worthy of so great a privilege, that he threw up everything for the hope of realising his desire. How long he had to wait, how much he had to suffer, what an ordeal he had to pass through before he could keep all his college terms, I shall not trouble you to listen to. But I must say this ; he was never more than a curate, a poor, struggling curate, yet the one question which sometimes marred his happiness \u2014 for he was happy in the middle of his hard work and heavy cares \u2014 was not whether he had done wisely in casting his early prospects to the winds,"], [43, "' OUT OF HER ELEMENT ' 31 it was whether his motives had been sufficiently pure to warrant him in daring to approach God's altar, and to incur the awful responsibility of the blood of souls.' He would stare and stammer, look put out and hang his handsome head a little, before he strolled away to chew the cud of ' Gerald's widow's ' peculiar ideas. And long before he could digest them, he would let them slip out of his mind altogether, until he forgot and repeated his offence, by renewing the careless assertion at which she took umbrage."], [44, "CHAPTER IV 'WE DON'T WANT THEIR INHERITANCE' The squire did not find the child Caleb in his way. Caleb's mother took care of that, while the old man looked with some satisfaction on his heir when the little lad crossed his senior's path. The child was not like his grandfather. He bore at the present moment few traits of the Langton race. Better not. Who knew ? For there was something more than promise, something that was already fulfil ment, in the square-browed, square-chinned child, whose big head had nothing abnormal in it, since it was joined to a vigorous little frame belonging to a goodly body in every respect. All the same, it was as if the small successor, innocent of the least encroachment or premature assumption of his rights, had appeared only to oust his predecessor. Mr Langton began visibly to fail and to grow more and more feeble from the day of his grandson's entrance on the scene. He died suddenly at last. He was found by his man-servant lying peacefully dead in bed, one summer morning, within three months of Mrs Gerald and Caleb's arrival at the Hall. 3*"], [45, "'WE DON'T WANT THEIR INHERITANCE' 33 The squire's funeral was a very large one, but save Agatha and Arthur, Mrs Gerald and her little boy, there were no relations, unless an old couple of family connections could be reckoned such. The family lawyer became a more prominent figure in consequence, so did a gentleman, not in his com pany, who had come down from London to attend the ceremony. He seemed to be a comparative stranger to the most of the party, and yet to be so well known to the chief mourners, and so much esteemed by them, that Arthur went aside for a moment to greet the visitor, before the mournful procession started, and signed to him, as he hung back, to walk next the members of the family. Rachel had never seen the gentleman before, and could not tell who he was ; while her curiosity was aroused by the prominent position he was called on to occupy. He was not insignificant, but he was shy and nervous looking, like a man who, it might be from a finer and more delicate organisa tion than that of his fellows, was easily disconcerted and put down. He had an air as if he were doubt ful of his right to come prominently forward in any affair of the Langtons, and was uncertain of his reception. Yet he appeared to have had at some time intimate relations with Mr Langton and his children. He was manifestly moved with emotion as he stood bareheaded by the open grave, with the west wind just stirring the soft, thin dark hair, already receding from the temples, and exposing C"], [46, "34 RACHEL LANGTON the somewhat blanched and emaciated, aquiline featured face of a man not above ten years older than Arthur Langton. The stranger, however prominent in the church, did not enter the house with the elderly couple and the lawyer to be present at the reading of the will. Mrs Gerald had a notion that Arthur invited him to join the little company, and that he hurriedly excused himself with some promise of calling later. The group in the library was enlarged by the presence of a few of the upper servants, and was almost as imposing a spectacle to the child Caleb as the hole in the earth where his grandfather's body was planted till God should make for him a new body. ' I am greatly afraid that I have some bad news to communicate to you,' said the elderly lawyer, who knew everybody there, except Mrs Gerald and her boy, as well as he knew his own house hold, and could be confidential, without a breach of lawyerly etiquette. He was a fresh, gentleman like little man, and looked all the brisker for an iron-grey wig which he wore to cover a bald head. For he treated the wig in an offhand manner, though it was modest and did not pretend to be the hair of a young man, he had a habit of pushing it a little aside in moments of excitement. At the first mention of 'bad news' Mrs Gerald had looked up, and a light had come into her"], [47, "'WE DON'T WANT THEIR INHERITANCE' 35 grey eyes. It was a light at once resolute, severe, and not without a certain sombre joy in its flash. Had the squire in some mysterious fashion made away with his property in his lifetime ? Had he died a poor man ? Would she have to recom mence her struggle with adverse circumstances ? Would she also be a free woman again, entirely mistress of herself and her boy ? ' We are all friends here,' went on Mr Sea combe the lawyer ; ' I may speak plainly. I was honoured with the confidence of my late lamented employer and friend. I am perfectly aware what his testamentary intentions were. I know they occupied him a great deal during the last year of his life. He came frequently to my office in Westbridge, and consulted with me on the subject. I had it from his own lips that he destroyed a will executed within the lifetime of his son Richard. But though I drew up another for him, and pressed the necessity for immediate action on his part, I have no reason to suppose that he ever signed it. Indeed I have found it, without his signature, in the search I have been making among his papers for the last two days. I have not come upon another will. I do not believe that any such exists. It is my opinion that Mr Langton died intestate.' There was a movement of grave acquiescence from Arthur, to whom the lawyer had already spoken in order to prepare him for what might"], [48, "36 RACHEL LANGTON be a very serious calamity to him and his sister. A rustle of astonishment from the elderly couple, who were connections by marriage, went so far, where the gentleman was concerned, as to cul minate in an audible, 'Dear! dear! who would have thought it? \u2014 a man of his property \u2014 very reprehensible.' Rachel was looking and listening with roused intelligence. ' What makes the matter more disastrous \u2014 I fear I must say disastrous,' continued Mr Sea combe, ' is that the late squire at one time went in for buying land, and was always re luctant to get quit of his purchases \u2014 in short did not go in for selling again, naturally, when the price of land fell. You know what the land laws are, and what obstacles they present to the transfer of land, especially when one has to do with a man of the squire's disposition. He had losses and family expenses which he had not counted upon, and there was his ready money tied up from him ! Of course he had to borrow, with the usual result' 'And he has ended by leaving an unsigned will ! ' cried the elderly connection, unable to keep from drumming his indignation with the hand \u2014 which already wore a mourning ring for his friend \u2014 on the table at his elbow, and speaking in accents of unfeigned alarm amounting to horror."], [49, "' WE DON'T WANT THEIR INHERITANCE' 37 ' I am certain my poor father acted for the best, and his death was sudden in the end,' in terrupted Arthur, curtly, feeling Agatha trembl ing in every limb where she sat next him, and knowing by sympathy what torture any reflec tion on the dead man must be to her. ' Nobody doubts that, Arthur,' said the old gentleman, who had just spoken, getting testier and testier in his very regard for the family. ' But this is a very serious business, and no sen timental scruples should prevent us from getting to the bottom of it. As Mr Seacombe says, we are all friends here. Do I understand you aright, sir, that Mr Langton has left little or nothing beyond his landed property, and even that a good deal encumbered ? ' ' I am sorry to say it is so,' said Mr Seacombe, distinctly. ' There is some lying money, but I am afraid that there are debts to that amount. When I say this, I feel as if it reflected dis credit on me, his legal adviser of many years' standing, but my feelings are of little conse quence in such circumstances, and I think you will believe me when I say that I did my best to prevent Mr Langton's running the risk of what has happened. But he judged for himself with regard to the uncertainty, as he was per fectly entitled to do. He was a deliberate man \u2014 very \u2014 in all his transactions.' * Then the whole of the landed property, which"], [50, "38 RACHEL LANGTON means nearly everything, falls without reservation or condition \u2014 ' questioned the kinsman, stopping short in his question as if unable or unwilling to complete it. ' To the heir-at-law, of course,' said the lawyer, brusquely, looking down and fidgeting with a gold pencil-case he had instinctively pulled out, ' unconditionally, as you suggest, unless he should ever choose, when it is in his power, to act on the instructions which I wrote down at the squire's dictation.' 'Was there no marriage settlement on the late Mrs Langton and her children, which may interfere with this monstrous disposal of the whole effects ? ' urged the lawyer's interrogator. ' Unfortunately there was not,' replied Mr Sea combe, regretfully. ' Mr Langton, who was ac customed to look at all the sides of a question before he took a step, was rather hasty in the matter of his marriage \u2014 a hastiness which he never had any reason to be sorry for,' with an apologetic glance at Agatha and Arthur. ' You are aware that he married the orphan daughter of a general officer. She was living in the care of relations, who ought to have looked after her interests and those of her children. But I believe they were thoughtless people, without business habits, and as Mr Langton's father, who was then alive, did not approve of the marriage when it took place, there would have been difficulties to surmount. No, I"], [51, "'WE DON'T WANT THEIR INHERITANCE' 39 am sorry to say, there was no marriage settle ments. 'Then Miss Langton and her brother are left absolutely unprovided for?' protested their aggrieved champion in much heat. ' No, not quite so,' said Mr Seacombe, more coolly, as became a professional man. ' An uncle of their mother's left Mrs Langton three thousand pounds, which was secured to Miss Langton. It is well invested, and brings in an income of about a hundred and forty pounds a year.' ' Oh, do not think of me,' cried Agatha, with a little sob. ' I am perfectly well off. It is Arthur, poor dear Arthur \u2014 ' ' Never mind me,' said Arthur, a little huskily. ' I can find something to do. I can go abroad \u2014 a man can always knock about for himself, if he does not fall on his feet.' ' Nonsense,' interrupted his self-elected guardian, ' your college course must be completed. Your father intended you to be provided for by the family living, and then you can take Agatha to the Rectory. It is the interval that is the rub \u2014 but there are family friends \u2014 ' He stopped short and his voice wavered a little. He glanced uneasily at his wife, who glanced back nervously at him. They were not rich, and they had children of their own, some of them as improvident as poor old Tom Langton's children had been."], [52, "40 RACHEL LANGTON ' If Agatha could come to us for a few weeks,' said the middle-aged matron, hesitatingly, ' we should do what we could,' and then she too stopped short. Mr Seacombe also moved restlessly in his chair. He shared in the wish to be a liberal family friend, but at a date long before the present, he had been in haste to grow rich. He had been cursed with an evil genius of speculation, and the drains which these unprosperous speculations had made upon him swallowed up, to this day, all that he could spare from his professional income after the main tenance of his family. Suddenly a clear, slightly sharp voice broke the silence which was getting intolerable to everybody. ' You mean that all the squire's property comes to the child ? ' said Gerald's widow, indicating little Caleb who sat very still between his mother and his aunt, and looked on with an old-fashioned face at the scene, as if he took it all in, and came to his own conclusions on it Mr Seacombe bowed formally. He did not think that there was either good feeling or good taste in the interposition of such a comparative stranger as Mrs Gerald, in order to make assurance doubly sure with regard to her son's inheritance. ' And the old man's own children are to go with out ? Can anything be more invidious or unjust ? ' she demanded."], [53, "'WE DON'T WANT THEIR INHERITANCE' 41 He stared hard at her, where she sat with a faint pink of anger rising in her pale cheeks. ' It is in accordance with the law of the land, madam,' he said drily, for he was not sure whether her displeasure was not feigned. ' Then it is an iniquitous law,' she said hotly. ' Nobody belonging to me shall profit by it, with my consent. Do you think that I am a pensioner, for my son's sake, on his grandfather's bounty, which he never grudged us, in order to repay him in the end, by robbing his children ? ' ' It is not you who rob them, remonstrated Mr Seacombe, ' if you will call it rob \u2014 it is the law, armed by what I must call the late squire's fatal habit of procrastination.' ' But it shall not be,' maintained Rachel, wrath sully. ' I will not have it done in my boy's name. Let him have his share, his father's share. That is right and fair enough \u2014 nobody need scruple to take that. When I heard Caleb spoken of as Mr Langton's heir, I had no idea that the squire's entire means consisted of landed property. Or, if it were so, that it was not charged with an ample provision for those who were nearest to him, who had honoured and loved him all their lives, whom he knew and loved best. This arrangement which you speak of is a totally different affair, and as Caleb's mother, speaking for him, I will not con sent to it.' ' It is not in your power to prevent it, madam,' said"], [54, "42 RACHEL LANGTON the lawyer, inflexibly, but with a certain respectful deference stealing into his voice, notwithstanding the fact that he now recognised her as the reverse of a woman of the world, as in truth little better than a fool. ' Caleb Langton is a minor, whom the law will protect. It will forbid all tampering with his goods and chattels till he is of an age \u2014 to de termine what to do with them. The law will protect him from you \u2014 his nearest relative \u2014 as well as from a stranger, or a deadly enemy. I expect we shall have to make him a ward of Chancery without loss of time. Why, your own allowance,' suddenly recollecting a farther point in the case, ' was voluntary on the squire's part, and dies with him. You yourself will have to depend for an income on what the law gives you, out of your son's property, for the purpose of rearing him.' And all the time the young squire, on whom so much depended, sat staring at the dancing motes of sunshine, freely admitted by the drawing up of the window blinds after the setting forth of the funeral, as once upon a time a certain young king sat in a stormy assembly and stared at a hole in the council room carpet. There was the half-absurd, half-pathetic unconsciousness of childhood, only slightly disturbed by the dawning sense that his mother was angry, which caused little Caleb to take a tighter grip of Mrs Gerald's black gown, and gaze up, wondering and fearful, in her face."], [55, "43 CHAPTER V ' THE LAST CHAPTER OF A MELANCHOLY TALE ' It was as Mr Seacombe had said. It sounded a grievous wrong to an unsophisticated, uncompre hending woman like Mrs Gerald. She could not bring herself to be a party to it. She declared, with perfect truthfulness, that she did not believe she could ever look Agatha and Arthur in the face again if she did, she would not be able to think of their father, nay, she would shrink from recalling the memory of her own dead husband, their brother. It was in vain for the Langtons to assure her, as they took every means of doing, that they no more blamed her than they blamed the innocent child, for dispossessing them of their inheritance. They had always known that they must give place to little Caleb, though they had not foreseen that Arthur would be left penniless and Agatha reduced to comparative poverty. The last result was an accident, a misfortune for which nobody was ac countable, since they could not bring themselves to echo the censure on the father, who had so lately passed from his place as the head of the household. Ten years hence Arthur, hardened by"], [56, "44 RACHEL LANGTON a prolonged experience of the injury inflicted on him and his sister, might be less tolerant. But at present the lad's heart was little less tender than the woman's. He would not willingly have a single word said against the poor old governor who, so far from deliberately designing to hurt his children, would have cut off his right hand at any moment to promote their welfare. ' It is good of you to care so much, Rachel,' Agatha would murmur, going up to her discomfited sister-in-law and kissing her affectionately, and not merely as a matter of form, for the first time since Mrs Gerald came to the Hall. ' It is wonderful of you, too, forgive me for saying so, not to care to be mistress here.' 'It is not wonderful when I am the wrong woman in the wrong place ; and it is not I, it is you, Agatha, you and Arthur, who are good not to hate us,' cried Rachel, vehemently, breaking down in her self-possession and composure. ' Hate you, dear ? How could we be so wicked, so unreasonable ? Why, it is all, in great part at least, in the course of nature, I mean in the order of things, for people in our station. If our dear father had been able to sign his will, as he fully intended to do, it would have been just as it should be. Hate ! We only wish you to let us love you and the little squire, and to wish him joy of his inheritance,' with a slight falter of the sweet voice."], [57, "' THE LAST CHAPTER OF A MELANCHOLY TALE ' 45 ' There is no room for love where such crying injustice is committed,' said Mrs Gerald, gloomily, with what sounded like harshness in her tones, after the caressing accents of the other. It was soon settled that Agatha should find a home with an invalid aunt at Tunbridge Wells. It was Arthur's prospects which remained blank, though his sister did her best to clear them up, in a stroll the two took together, under the double row of yews which grew behind the house, and were as venerable and as highly prized as was the great oriel window. ' Don't you remember, Attie,' she approached him with womanly wiles, ' how, when our poor mother died, and you thought yourself too big a boy to cry in public, but used to sob yourself to sleep every night, that you were not ashamed to show your tear-stained face before me. You let me steal in, like a ghost, and read you to sleep.' ' You were a very welcome and winsome ghost, Sis,' he said affectionately. ' You were my own boy to whom I taught your lessons, as long as my small learning would serve for the pleasant task ; why, then, should you object to let me help you now? I shall be all right with Aunt Maria, and you will stay on at Oxford till you have taken your degree. You will suffer me to sell out what is wanted, from the principal of my little portion, to defray your expenses. What is mine is yours \u2014 you will repay me a hundred-"], [58, "46 RACHEL LANGTON fold, if you like, after you are Rector of Langton \u2014 why, it is your birthright which you would not renounce for a temporary inconvenience?' ' No, no, Agatha,' refused Arthur, with a firmness which was a recent acquisition, and had more to do with nascent manliness than had the down on his lip. ' Your little pittance is not to be imperilled. ' Aunt Maria is happy to have me with her,' said Agatha, wistfully, ' and I am vain enough to believe that I shall be able to make her home more cheer ful. You need have no hesitation in availing your self of my poor money, Arthur, dear ; you may give me that small gratification.' ' No, Sis, I tell you, no,' he repeated, ' I am not going to let you strip yourself for me ; you sha'n't deprive yourself of every chance of change and independent action. You shall not shrink into the mere nurse of an ailing, hypochondriacal old woman who means no harm, poor soul ! but has accustomed herself to think of nothing save her self and her ailments. Besides she may die any day, long before I am fit to take orders, and as her money is sunk in an annuity which she spends to the last penny on a sick woman's crotchets, she can make no suitable provision for you.' ' I am not afraid,' said Agatha, a little faintly. ' Perhaps not, but it is my business now to see that you do not make your position still worse than it is, even if Seacombe would let you, without a strong protest. Dick and even poor Gerald did"], [59, "' THE LAST CHAPTER OF A MELANCHOLY TALE ' 47 not answer my father's expectations. Do not urge me to act in a more rash and foolhardy manner than probably either of them would have acted. If I cannot manage in any other way I shall chuck up the whole thing. Among us all we have made you suffer enough as it is.' Intimate as the two were, the fact that he was half a dozen years her junior had kept him from ever making such an allusion before. She winced as if he had touched a vulnerable part. ' Don't think of that,' she said in a low, hurried tone. ' I can bear it. I ought to have realised that it could hardly be otherwise. It is only the last chapter of a melancholy tale, better forgotten. If Ben would but give over thinking of it, and turn to someone else who might have fortune and connections to give his talents and principles fair play, in the career which is still open to him, I \u2014 I believe I should desire nothing better.' He kissed her lovingly under the shade of the old trees, and turned the conversation in another direction to relieve her. Arthur, like everybody else, had scouted the idea which had at once entered Mrs Gerald's head, of making reparation for the unconscious wrong her marriage and the bare fact of the existence of her son had done to Agatha and Arthur. The wrong extended to the dead \u2014 to the supine old man who, though he had not approved of her, had not declined to befriend her, while, through her, his"], [60, "48 RACHEL LANGTON own children now stood in need of friends. But Arthur did not, because of his imperviousness to her arguments, withhold his confidence from his sister-in-law, or refrain from imparting to her, as well as to Sis, his jumble of unavailing regrets, haunting anxieties and crude, ill-digested plans. He had been drawn from the first to Rachel ; unlike as the two were, they had been friends after a fashion. He had listened and submitted to her passionate criticism of his motives and standpoints, only half comprehending her, but not resenting, as he might have resented, the same caustic words spoken by anyone else. He could not help putting faith in her counsel, though he thought her even less a woman of the world than Agatha was. To him Mrs Gerald was very much of a religious and social enthusiast \u2014 high-flown and unpractical. Nevertheless, he confessed to her his repentance for his misspent time and opportunities. He poured out to her his chaotic projects of trying for a scholarship, badly equipped as he felt conscious he was for the trial, of seeking an usher's situation in a school, or a post as a travelling companion. He would drudge in either position till he had saved enough money to live at the rate of a pound a week say, and pass the necessary examinations at his own expense. He would do that in prefer ence to borrowing the money \u2014 either from friend or moneylender, when he might die in the mean time, and where would his creditor be ? He could"], [61, "' THE LAST CHAPTER OF A MELANCHOLY TALE ' 49 insure his life, certainly, but if he worked as hard and lived on as little as he proposed to do, that course savoured of taking an insurance company at a disadvantage. The drawback in any case was that he must be so long of becoming Rector of Langton and pro viding a home for Agatha. ' Look here, Rachel,' he broke off to appeal to her, ' I know you do not think that such a consideration should weigh with me, as an inducement to enter the Church, but surely I ought not to make a worse clergyman because of caring for my own flesh and blood \u2014 my sister \u2014 and such a sister and daughter. Though she was so young and pretty, she was like a second mother to me when I was a miserable little chap. She never grudged any sacrifice for my father. She offered up her whole life and happiness, without a murmur, to benefit the rest of us. The Apostle Paul said a man ought to provide for his own household \u2014 why am I not to provide for Sis ? ' ' That is not the question,' said Rachel, doggedly. ' It is whether you should take the most solemn. vows a man can vow, and incur the most awful responsibility to provide for her or anyone else ? She is of age, she can provide for herself, even if she were not provided for as it is. She would not wish it, she is too good to accept such a fearful sacrifice. Though she were a helpless baby, in danger of starving, you had better break stones to earn bread to put into its poor little mouth, than D"], [62, "50 RACHEL LANGTON profane God's sanctuary by intruding into it for such a purpose.' 'But, Rachel,' protested Arthur in self-defence, < I always meant to do my best. I was brought up to the Church ; I was born \u2014 no, I am sensible you do not like that expression \u2014 but I always looked forward to being a clergyman. I was not aware of any disqualification or distaste ; on the contrary, I liked the prospect and \u2014 well, one does not care to speak of such things, but I trusted the Master I was going to serve would help me,' said Arthur humbly, ' would accept the insufficient offering, and make it better worth having, by not quenching the smoking flax, or breaking the bruised reed, don't you know? Agatha thought that too. Rachel,' he suddenly went off in another direction, ' I don't believe you half appreciate Agatha ; you saw Ether edge at the funeral \u2014 well, all that has had to be ripped up and renounced again.' ' I never heard of Etheredge,' said Mrs Gerald in the abrupt manner which tried Agatha. ' Oh, I forgot,' he said apologetically. ' I dare say you know nothing of Ben Etheredge, but you must have seen him at the funeral, for he is rather a striking figure, very spare and pale, with a stoop, and has a look of delicate health, though his health is all right. That was Benedict Etheredge, the man Agatha should have married seven years ago. He was then secretary to one of the Cabinet Ministers, and as he is well born and a very clever"], [63, "' THE LAST CHAPTER OF A MELANCHOLY TALE ' 51 fellow, his prospects were not at all bad, though he had little fortune to speak of. Can't you guess,' went on Arthur with some shyness stealing into his eager tale, ' that he was very fond of her, and she of him ? But first the minister he served changed his principles, and as poor Ben could not conscientiously follow his example, since he is an awful beggar for a conscience, he had to resign his post and content himself with the secretaryship to a private member of the House, which he still holds. Even then the marriage might have been permissible had my father seen his way to pay down the portion which it was understood Agatha was to have at his death. But the governor was already straitened for money. He was cumbered with Dick's debts, and \u2014 well, with other sources of expense which he could not cut off. It was not in his power to make a proper settlement on his only daughter. Had his will been rightly executed, he would have rectified the failure by a charge on the estate, and Etheredge, whom my father liked per sonally, naturally counted on this. He came down to pay my father the last mark of respect, and poor dear Sis had to undergo the cruel ordeal of giving him a second dismissal.' ' Why ? ' asked Mrs Gerald, with a kind of forced calmness. ' Agatha has still enough for both, if they care for each other. When your brother Gerald and I made up our minds to marry, we feared that your father would withdraw his allow-"], [64, "52 RACHEL LANGTON ance \u2014 I could wish he had. We had agreed that Gerald should try for a clerkship of some sort, and that we should marry on his salary, while I went on teaching such pupils as I could find. We could have done it, I would have managed, and we should have been happier even than we were, though he told me he had never been so happy in his life as during those fourteen short months which we spent in Eden.' She ended with her head held high, and something rapt in her look and tone. Arthur looked at her half in admiration, half in amazement. ' Perhaps you could have done it,' he said gently, ' and brought poor old Gerald up to the scratch \u2014 you should know best. But, you see, Agatha has grown up differently. Etheredge could not sub ject her to deprivations to which she had not been accustomed. As for her, nothing on earth would induce her to spoil his career, and be a party to his social ruin.' Mrs Gerald was dumb; clearly she was as in capable of appreciating his argument as he was of appreciating hers."], [65, "53 CHAPTER VI A LOST YOUNG KING The next time Mrs Gerald retired to her room, she took Caleb in her lap and sat down with him as if to consult with him. ' Yes, moder,' said the child in answer to her appeal. ' We don't want their inheritance, do we, Caleb? ' She addressed the little boy in low, resolute tones. ' We don't care for the unrighteous laws of this world, which adjudge all to you who are a step farther removed than they were from the squire to whom everything belonged. Everybody knows, and plenty of people could swear, he meant differently. Only the stroke of a pen was want ing, and for the lack of that your uncle and aunt are to be kept out of their rights for fifteen years, till you come to man's estate. Agatha is to be robbed of her lover and promised husband. Arthur's education is to be wasted ; he is to be cast adrift, perhaps led into terrible temptation.' ' Yes, moder,' repeated Caleb, like the little parrot he was at four years of age. But he turned from a moth which had sailed in at the open window and was claiming his attention, to look at her with"], [66, "RACHEL LANGTON 54 sphinx-like eyes, which seemed not only to read her secret, but to penetrate to the heart of all mysteries. ' Your poor father helped to do it, unwittingly, Caleb. I know it was that which Arthur meant, when he referred vaguely to other sources of ex pense that Mr Langton could not cut off. You and I contributed to the wrongdoing and consum mated it \u2014 I by marrying your father, and you by being born, you mite. Perhaps it is only just retribution that we should find ourselves the instru ments of punishing the old man in his grave, and the young man and woman who never gave us an insolent look or an unkind word. They received us generously according to their light ; they have been a loving uncle and aunt to you. But we will not consent to it, sonny ; it is too much to ask of us. We will not be accessory to their impoverishment \u2014 to what is to them their degradation.' ' No, we 'ont, moder,' responded the child from the bottom of his heart, with a profound depth of assurance. It was either an indication of his con ception of the extent of the renunciation implied in his ' no,' or a sign of the baffling of his poor baby brain, by his incapacity to follow her reasoning. A few mornings afterwards, to the unmitigated astonishment and consternation of the household, Mrs Gerald and her little boy were discovered missing when the rest of the family assembled for morning prayers and breakfast. The door of her"], [67, "A LOST YOUNG KING 55 room stood open. Her bed and his little crib were made up as if they had not been slept in. The modest amount of luggage which she had brought with her to the Hall was gone, sent away beforehand, probably. How she had managed to leave with the child, without being observed, either overnight or very early in the August morning, was inexplicable, unless by the old adage that ' where there is a will there is a way.' All that was left of the fugitives was a letter addressed to Arthur, in Mrs Gerald's strong, clear handwriting, lying as if to challenge notice on her writing-desk. ' Dear Arthur,' she said, \u2014 ' I cannot bring down on myself, and especially on my boy, the curse of having stripped you and Agatha of your rightful property. I cannot upset your father's plans for you, whatever the law may say to me for taking the matter into my own hands. I never coveted even a fraction of the estate for Caleb. I am not sure that the inheritance of a country gentleman, with his good things, including his sport, all ready for him to take up when he will, is really better than the lot of a labouring man in any line. The good things of the first are so often for the body and for this life alone, while the toil of the last \u2014 the sordid toil as many choose to call it, has at least the dignity of a serious obligation. The country gentleman, pardon me, appears to me very often like a younger or an older child at"], [68, "56 RACHEL LANGTON play, playing at work when the season of amuse ment is over, while the other is a man earning his bread in the sweat of his brow. I had rather that my Caleb grew up a man than continued a child all his days. But I knew that his grand father had a claim on him, so I was willing to let him succeed to the squire's land by natural succession, under reasonable conditions. As for his taking all as the heir-at-law, it is a most unnatural and unjust conclusion of the whole matter. It is a wrong which, if we submitted to it, could not be remedied for many a long year. But neither he nor I \u2014 acting for him \u2014 will have any thing to do with it. I am quite able to work for the boy and provide for him ; I desire nothing better. I have been brought up to work. I am only too happy and proud to have a little son for whom I can work. I took Mr Langton Vallowance \u2014 never dreaming how he, a great landowner, could be pressed for money. I did it simply because it seemed to me that he had a right to give it, that he had a share in Caleb, and that I was not at liberty to deny his share. You and Agatha must let us go, and think no more of us ! I am sorry that what I have to do can be done in no other way, than by asking you to give us up, and by our seeing no more of each other \u2014 not even knowing what becomes of each other unless it may be at some distant day. I have never'guessed how well I liked you and Agatha till I have to"], [69, "A LOST YOUNG KING 57 bid you good-bye. Caleb will miss you dread fully, and ask for you many a time. Why should we go then, perhaps you will say ? That we may be clear of lending ourselves to a grievous in jury, that we may not be the obstacles in your way. If we go out of sight and hearing, and are never heard of again, the law may have the goodness to treat us as if we had never been. Agatha will still be the mistress of the Hall, until she marry Mr Etheredge. You will finish your studies. But oh, dear Arthur, think long and well before you enter the Lord's priesthood. If He should ever call you, indeed \u2014 you need not fear to mistake His calling \u2014 and I were to hear of it, none would so rejoice as I. \u2014 Your grateful and affectionate sister, ' Rachel Langton.' Agatha was full of dismay at the scandal. ' Oh, dear, it is such a foolish thing for poor Rachel to have done,' cried her sister-in-law in as much exasperation as so gracious a woman could compass. ' Of course they will be over taken and brought back. The suspense is bad enough as it is. It would be intolerable if one were not certain of the end. Poor, dear, little Caleb ! to be run away with, like a child in a novel, and by his own mother \u2014 of all persons ! But think how the affair will be talked about, it may even get into the newspapers. If she had only known how"], [70, "58 RACHEL LANGTON one must hate such an exposure, how our father would have detested it, she could not have been guilty of the outrageous step.' ' She did not know \u2014 she is not acquainted with the light that beats upon a throne. She is a child of nature, in a sense ; she did what seemed right in her own eyes, without heeding what Mrs Grundy would say. I verily believe there is no Mrs Grundy for such as Rachel.' Arthur spoke satirically, almost savagely, an unusual mood for the light-hearted, easy-going lad of the past, and an unwonted tone for him to adopt to the bewildered, wounded Agatha. He was rendered thoroughly wretched by what had happened. He did not like the public speculation which would be excited, any more than Agatha liked it. He had the same fastidious dis taste to extravagance of conduct and noisy clamour, the same lively horror of vulgar, unprivileged eyes prying into family secrets. Further, he was very anxious on Rachel and the little boy's account. She was no fool, though she might be an enthusiast, with an enthusiast's warp of passion crossing the woof of an otherwise calm and reasonable nature. As he had a high opinion of her understanding, he was sceptical of her being followed and brought back without difficulty. He had no doubt that she had contrived her flight well, and surrounded it with so many precautions that she would not be easily traced, even with all the clues and tools that the modern machinery of society supplies. Even"], [71, "A LOST YOUNG KING 59 when found, would she return to the Hall and give up her schemes, save under compulsion ? And how was compulsion to be applied to such an offender ? The law whose decrees she had defied, must settle that, even to bringing her up for contempt of Court \u2014 the great Court of Chancery, which would pre sently take possession of Caleb as its ward. In the meantime, how would the mother and child fare ? He had always understood that she had been in the habit, ever since her widowhood, of helping different members of her family. He did not believe that she had any money saved from her late allowance, because she had considered herself and her son as placed beyond the uncertainties of life and the dread of want, and she had cared for little more. But she might soon be in straits, clever as she was, and undauntedly as she had written to him. Caleb must hamper her, and, as Arthur had often read, every channel of work for even unencumbered women was besieged by a host of hungry applicants. Rachel was so independent and enduring that she would starve before she gave in and owned herself beaten on a question of principle. She would starve first, while she fed Caleb as the pelican was fabled to feed her young, with her life-blood. But the man who was most incensed by Mrs Gerald's contumacious and preposterous behaviour was Mr Seacombe. He spoke as if, in his in dividual person, he resented the gross affront"], [72, "60 RACHEL LANGTON to legal etiquette and decorum. He believed she must be idiotic, though he had been taken in to the extent of giving her credit for some common sense and a certain amount of business faculty. But these high-flying women, who were unlike their neighbours, had always a screw loose, whether as advanced Socialists or pronounced Nihilists. The idea of the simple, thoughtless boy Gerald, old Tom Langton's son, marrying a Socialist or a Nihilist! After all, it did not signify much what people thought or said, the real businesss was to recover the lost heir of Langton Hall."], [73, "61 CHAPTER VII ARTHUR'S DISCOVERY It was not done in a hurry. Arthur was right in this. Every search was made, as privately as the case would admit of, without success. Nothing could be learnt further than that a young lady in mourning, having a little child with her \u2014 the pair unhesitatingly identified as Mrs Gerald Langton and the late squire's grandson, had been seen at the Langton station, before the first train was due, on one of these early autumn mornings. The lady had taken a ticket for an obscure little town in the north of England. But the little town was not Mrs Gerald's birthplace, in which she had spent the greater part of her life. It was not even in the same county with the other town, and had clearly been used as a blind, for at the townlet all trace of the travellers was lost. They must have been comparative strangers there, and they had arrived on the occasion of an annual local festival, when, in the unusual bustle, comers and goers were not much noticed. The comers in question had cer tainly not tarried at the first stage of their journey, and where they had gone afterwards remained a"], [74, "62 RACHEL LANGTON mystery, which their pursuers, though the fugitives had only the advantage of a few hours in advance, failed to fathom. Not Arthur, with his youthful energy \u2014 not Mr Seacombe armed with the might of the law, furnished with a full measure of pro fessional sagacity and backed by private detectives, summoned post-haste for the purpose \u2014 not Agatha with her woman's wit could see into that mill stone. The hue and cry gradually died away. The law itself could do nothing in the absence of the offender. Mrs Gerald and her son were as if they had never been. It was arranged that Agatha should stay on at the Hall. She did it the more readily, because, as she told Arthur wistfully, ' I believe that is what poor infatuated Rachel would have wished. In my annoyance at her strange defiance of authority and her laying bare our family concerns, I did not do justice to the mis taken sense of honour, and the warm sympathy with our misfortunes, which prompted the rash act.' Arthur at last consented, in the altered circum stances, to borrow part of Agatha's income and to avail himself of other means which happily pre sented themselves, in order to return to Oxford and work for his degree. There, in his college class-room, in the middle of his lectures, Arthur was often fain to fall into a brown study, and struggle with the knotty problem of Rachel Lang-"], [75, "ARTHUR'S DISCOVERY 63 ton's lofty principles, and austere, uncompromising views of life, which had not prevented her from flying off at a tangent, as he called it, violating the laws of the country, and dispoiling her child of his legitimate inheritance. The elastic spirit and buoyant temper of Arthur's two-and-twenty years returned to him in time, but not his trifling with his talents, or his forgetfulness of solemn ob ligations. He did not hasten to enter the Church ; on the contrary, he went through a more extended probation and voluntary hard apprenticeship in East London, and in debased, heathenish country districts, than his friends thought necessary. It was not till six years after Mrs Gerald had taken French leave of Langton, that a young English clergyman, easily distinguished by his dress, was refreshing himself by a walking tour in Saxon Switzerland. In the course of his tour, he had come to an out-of-the-way tributary of the Elbe, and on it a quaint little northern town with its Stadthaus, its Dojnkirche, and its Gymnasium all complete. Arthur Langton was traversing the old fashioned main street, looking about him with in terest at the painted and plastered wooden houses with their dormer roofs, and fancying himself car ried back to Reformation times. All at once, he caught sight of a figure in front of him, which made him start violently, and forget everything save the present. It was the figure of a tall woman in well-worn mourning, the dress of a widow. She"], [76, "64 RACHEL LANGTON was alone, and by the basket on her arm had been doing her marketing, according to the thrifty prac tice of the townswomen. There were certain tricks of her erect, free gait, though her step was much slower than formerly, which he was sure he did not mistake. He quickened his walk till he was abreast of her and could look into her face. ' Rachel,' he cried, ' sister,' and he caught her by the arm and held her fast. It was her turn to start nervously. As she glanced round at him, an unmistakable gleam of pleasure and thankfulness shot into her grey eyes, the next moment it was quenched by fast-coming tears. In the old days, she had not cried lightly ; indeed, though he knew that she carried about with her a life-long sorrow, he could not recollect having seen her cry at all. ' You here, Arthur ! ' was all that she said, as if they had parted yester day, and yet with a suppressed sob in her voice which did not belong to yesterday. ' Forgive me for being weak and foolish and quickly upset,' she added hastily, ' I have undergone a great deal of anxiety lately, while I myself have not been very strong.' What hollows there were in her formerly firmly rounded cheeks ! what shadows beneath her weep ing eyes ! A horrible dread clutched at his heart. ' Where is little Caleb \u2014 my brother's son ? ' he asked sharply, not in his old, easy, complacent tones, but with a"], [77, "ARTHUR'S DISCOVERY 65 stern directness which might have emulated her own speech, as he had occasionally heard it. ' He is at home, where I am going,' she answered without any resentment or attempt at evasion. ' Come with me and you will see him. But I must tell you that he has been ill, very ill. He had whooping cough and measles badly ; the one after the other poor boy ; but he is getting over his ailments, and the doctor says he will do well now.' ' And you did not communicate with Agatha or me, his near relatives,' he spoke indignantly \u2014 all the more indignantly that, as he took another look at her face, he cried to himself in dismay, ' Good heavens ! she has not been allowing herself bread to eat, she has been actually starving ! ' ' I could not very well communicate with you,' she said simply ; then, after a little pause, she went on with a faint smile, breaking in upon the gravity of her face, ' He will not know you again, I am afraid, but he will soon understand who you are, and where you have come from. He was ten years old last week, and he is far forward for his age. He has always retained a slight remembrance of you and Agatha, and been fond of hearing stories of the Hall.' ' He may be,' said Arthur significantly, seeking to take her basket from her, and to offer her his arm. ' No, no,' she resisted, ' you are not accustomed to carry baskets and parcels and to figure in such E"], [78, "66 RACHEL LANGTON company. If it were not that you are not ac quainted with the way, and that since you are here, I really wish you to see your nephew, I should go on before and leave you to call at our e~tage.' 'You are the old woman,' he told her; 'and how do you know what I am accustomed to do nowadays ? I am a lad no longer ; I am the Rector of Langton.' He looked at her steadily, not without a twinkle of humour in the earnest ness of his glance, but the earnestness was far in excess of the humour. ' Why are you and Caleb here? What are you finding to do to compensate for the desertion of your natural duties ? ' ' They are not our natural duties,' she asserted, with a flash of her old spirit ; ' not when assum ing them would have cast you and Agatha adrift. But I will tell you everything \u2014 I had no wish for concealment, if it could have been avoided \u2014 the truth is I loathe it. But I dared not so much as write, lest I should provoke detection. I had to stay, famished for tidings. That was my discipline or punishment, as you would call it, I suppose.' ' You cared so much as that ! ' he ejaculated in surprise. 'Of course I cared,' she answered simply. 'You may have thought that I had no heart, but I had, and nobody had been anything save good to me at the Hall. You were Caleb's kindred and Gerald's people, and you yourself were like a younger brother, submitting, as my own brothers would"], [79, "ARTHUR'S DISCOVERY 67 hardly have submitted, to be scolded and called to account by a presumptuous, dogmatic stranger.' ' You were not a stranger ; you were Gerald's widow,' he answered promptly, ' and I was a heed less young ass in those days. I deserved all I got, and a great deal more. But you have not told me how you came here.' ' I was in Saxony at school as a pupil-teacher when I was a girl. The moment I wanted to get away and be lost sight of, I remembered Mittes heim. I thought that my old teacher, who knew me, and was familiar with what I could do, might give me work. Then there was an excellent gymnasium to which Caleb could go, when he was past the kindergarten. It all happened as I planned it. I have taught English and music in the girls' school, and Caleb has been at the gymnasium for three years now. We have been respectable and happy in our way, and I trust you and Agatha have been happy in yours,' she ended quickly. ' Hum ! ' he said, ' I am willing to admit you meant well, but I cannot pretend that what you did really contributed to our happiness.' Her fine face fell a little, and she changed the subject so far. ' As I told you,' she resumed hastily, ' there was quite an outbreak of children's epidemics this spring, and Caleb had first one and then another, while he could not shake off their effects. I could not be with him in the hospital, so"], [80, "68 RACHEL LANGTON I resigned my post as teacher and had him brought home.' ' And the expenses \u2014 ?' questioned Arthur, briefly. ' I was just able to meet them,' she said, with a long-drawn breath, which betokened a desperate struggle only recently ended. ' Everybody was kind, but nobody here is rich, or indeed anything save what you would call poor in England. People have barely enough for themselves, and must stint their charities lest their own households be left destitute. The boy is not like me and my brothers and sisters,' she broke off to explain, with a shade of impatience and vexation. ' He is not so hardy, though he has pluck enough ; he has inherited his share of your Langton constitution. He sickened at good, plain food, after he was ill. He craved the dainties on which he had set as little store as a boy could set, when he was in health, and it was necessary to get them for him.' ' Is it possible you would have risked his life by stinting him in what he wanted, when you knew he could easily have commanded a hundred times more ? ' demanded Arthur, with a tremble of passion in his voice. ' Would you have done that \u2014 sooner than humble your pride, and abate your self-will, by applying to me or Seacombe ? ' She looked at him, taken aback. This was not the complacent, quickly put-down Arthur she had known. ' I contrived not to stint him,' she said, with"], [81, "ARTHUR'S DISCOVERY 69 something of her old, independent, self-sufficing air, but she broke down the next instant. ' Oh ! Arthur, I did write. I began two letters to you \u2014 I have them in my desk at this moment \u2014 but I was too troubled and perplexed to finish them, when the need was past. Sometimes I thought I must have done wrong after all, and that this was the punish ment sent to me for keeping my boy all to myself. Then I feared that I was tempted to save his dear body at the expense of his far more precious soul,' she added, her voice breaking and her eyes dilating in awe, in the contemplation of the tremendous issues she had evoked. ' For we know, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven.' ' Yes, and all things are possible with God,' he said, with unfaltering decision, ' while the harder the battle to be fought, the more slippery the high places to be trodden, the more honourable the warfare, the more glorious the victory. Where were your faith and trust, Rachel ? and what, in the name of wonder, did you propose to do with the boy, in order to keep him out of temptation ? Even a gymnasium education is hardly the equipment for a hewer of wood and drawer of water.' ' I thought,' she said, with a mixture of diffi dence and defiance, ' that if he saw his way, if he received the call, he might be trained to be a Lutheran pastor.'"], [82, "70 RACHEL LANGTON ' So,' said Arthur, meaningly, ' a pastor from his cradle like the Rector of Langton from his birth.' ' No, indeed,' she contradicted him vehemently ; ' you are aware how little worldly wealth and honour belong to a German pastor, who is not a professor, whose lot is not cast in a wealthy town, but in the depth of the country. He is not much better off in his means, or much less homely in his habits, than the well-to-do peasants around him. Not only every remote sprig of nobility with a von tacked to his name, every government official, well nigh every other professional man, holds a pastor's social rank in small esteem. Yet he is the vicegerent of a divine Master, His representative, the holder of the keys of His kingdoms.' ' You thought Caleb would be safer from sordid aims and mean ambitions, the poorer he was. per haps the more uncouth and illiterate. I admire your woman's logic,' said Arthur, with quick irony. She looked at him again searchingly. ' He would have kept his handful of sheep in the wilder ness,' she said at last. ' And that would have been well, excellently well,' he rejoined in the same breath. ' No man can do better than faithfully discharge the duty en trusted to him. But he might be as loyal to the five talents as to the two \u2014 granted the talents. He might lead out many sheep as well as few. You do not mean that the Good Shepherd does not care for the rich and great in this world as well as for"], [83, "ARTHUR'S DISCOVERY 71 the poor and obscure ? That would be a miserable look out for the great ones of this earth. But what in God's name are our paltry differences and dis tinctions to our Maker and Master, whose children and brethren we are, yet in whose sight we are all poor and blind and naked ? ' ' I am not always sure what I do mean,' she said impulsively, ' but I begin to think, Arthur Lang ton, that I have been presumptuous and foolish,' she went on slowly, looking up in his honest, manly young face \u2014 honest and manly as he sought, in the first place, to confute her defec tive reasoning. She realised as she looked at his clear, straightforward eyes, his open forehead, the frankness, and at the same time the reverence with which he spoke. ' You will be no hire ling as I once feared, in my short-sightedness and lack of charity, that you would be. You will be a true shepherd, who will go in and out among your flock, and find them pasture ; you would defend them from the wolves, and die for them if need were. I doubted your mission before ; I am wiser, I do not doubt it, now. I think Agatha, too, had her mission to those of her own rank and culture, and to the rude and ignorant to whom she must have appeared like an angel of light. Is Agatha with you ? Is she as beautiful and gentle as ever ? I should like to see Agatha again ; she may not for give me for my disregard of all the proprieties, but perhaps she will consent to see me once more.'"], [84, "72 RACHEL LANGTON He smiled brightly, like the Arthur of old, at these words. ' Agatha is not with me,' he told her, ' for the very good reason that she was married to Etheredge two years ago, and has her own home, husband, and baby to occupy her. But you need not flatter yourself that it was anything which you did that brought about the marriage,' he said, shaking his head, and feeling bound to undeceive her. ' An uncle of Etheredge's left him some money, and he got a better appointment, so that they could marry without losing their self-respect and sacrificing themselves and each other, though I don't expect you to endorse these reservations.' \u25a0 At least I am glad they are happy,' she said, speaking ungrudgingly in her growing forbearance. ' Here is our house, and yonder is Caleb at the win dow looking out for me. How astonished he will be when he finds that I have brought him back an uncle, a real live uncle, for a treat this time. He is tall for his age, and he cannot fail to be very thin at present ; but if you had seen him even a fortnight ago, you would appreciate the improve ment,' she assured her listener wistfully."], [85, "73 CHAPTER VIII THE INEVITABLE He looked up at the little house baking in the noon-day sunshine. He went up the bare, shabby staircase, flavoured with smoke and cabbages, and bearing by no means dubious signs of numerous occupants on every landing. He climbed flight after flight of unswept stairs, thinking all the while of Langton Hall in its leafy coolness and seclusion, of the ancient oriel window, and the venerable yews, the pride of generations of Langtons. He thought also of the well-bred dignity, the exquisite comfort, the subdued luxury, which were consist ent with a stately simplicity, in the carefully kept-up manor house of the nineteenth century. He was shown through the white-washed aridity of the entrance hall into a small sitting-room, with its well-scrubbed boards, its prominent white stove unlit at this season, its little rug and little sofa piled with an invalid's cushions and wraps. The only other conspicuous articles of furniture were a plain, serviceable piano half-filling the room, and a bookcase stuffed with school books. Every thing for use and nothing for show."], [86, "74 RACHEL LANGTON A long, lean, white-faced little lad confronted the new-comers. The presence of a stranger did not overwhelm him, but it kept him from advanc ing until his mother spoke, \u2014 ' This is your Uncle Arthur, Caleb. We came across each other in the street,' she said, as quietly as if the encounter was the most ordinary occurrence. 'It is nice for you to see him again, and I must ask you to become better acquainted, without any assist ance from me, since I have to beg your uncle to excuse me for the infliction of a music lesson, given at his elbow. I am trying to return to my teaching now that Caleb is better. A pupil is due at this hour. Ah, that is Fraiilein Eckenberg's ring' She flung off her bonnet and mantle, still a young woman in her rapid movements, and sat down by the piano without a symptom of being disconcerted ; while a stolid blonde damsel did not even blink her blue eyes at the unex pected addition to the audience, but was soon planted on the music-stool, working hard at her scales. It was to that matter-of-fact accompaniment, perhaps as good as any other, that the uncle and nephew renewed their acquaintance. An intelligent urchin, if a little shy, as well as a little brusque and pragmatical, according to the manner of German urchins, speaking his mother's tongue very fairly. He brightened up with natural boyish interest when Arthur asked him if he"], [87, "THE INEVITABLE 75 remembered the dogs and horses at Langton Hall, and the cricket field which Caleb's grand father had given to the village players, just outside the park gates. His uncle had taken the boy there occasionally, small as he was, six years ago, in order to watch the boys of the village school play a game. ' He says he would like to go home with me,' said Arthur Langton boldly, when the lesson was ended and the damsel gone. The uncle spoke, not altogether concealing, or for that matter, caring to conceal, a note of triumph in his voice. ' It would, be a capital change for him after his illness.' 'Yes, mother,' said the boy, with the simple decision and modest confidence \u2014 not of a spoilt, conceited child, but of a little fellow who had something of a mind of his own to make up, who had all along been treated by his mother as a friend and companion. ' I think we should go home and try what it is like. Uncle Arthur says we have never tried, that it is not fair to renounce a task without giving it a trial. He says it is not right to expect him or anybody else to undertake it for us, when we ourselves have not so much as taken it up. If it is our task, we are bound to find out if we can do it, however little we may like it. Nobody else can relieve us, because neither we nor anybody in the world can tell what he can do till he try."], [88, "76 RACHEL LANGTON You have always said that about my lessons, mother, when I went to the gymnasium first, and when I was put into the hospital and had to swallow so much nasty stuff.' How like the boy was to his mother, now that his animation made you forget his wanness and the emaciation from recent illness ! ' And you, too, Caleb, even you ! ' she said, clasping and unclasp ing her hands, with her colour coming and going. ' It seems as if everybody and everything were going against me, and my own heart and judgment turning traitors just because you were ill, and I have feared that I could not get everything you wanted to make you well again. That, and the small circumstance that I chanced to meet your Uncle Arthur when I was coming from the market. Was it chance or was it Providence ? Did I make a great mistake and commit a double act of wrong in my imperiousness and my determination to judge and act for myself and you, child?' ' You did wrong that good might come of it, like a few other heroic but mistaken men and women,' put in Arthur. ' And were you in the right, Arthur ' \u2014 she turned to him \u2014 ' when you urged that the laws of a country were made for the safety and well-being of the many? If their justice misgave some times, and fell with cruel hardship on the few, the accident must be accepted and submitted to, as one of the inevitable imperfections of all human"], [89, "THE INEVITABLE 77 systems. Has my sin, in denying and resisting this obligation, only been condoned and my punish ment averted, because, in the midst of wrath, God remembers mercy ? Has all that I tried to do in these six years been a blunder and a waste ? ' ' Not a waste,' cried Arthur, warmly ; ' nothing that is done with the best and purest intentions, in the name of what the doer reckons \u2014 however mis takenly \u2014 justice and mercy, can be altogether a waste. Your unhesitating protest against what you fancied an unfair judgment in Caleb's favour was one lesson ; your absolute indifference to wealth, and to all that wealth can buy, was another. You taught me, above all, some truths, which I trust I shall carry with me to my grave.' Caleb standing and listening bewildered to it all, caught at the only sentences which he could fathom. ' I am not turning against you, Miitter chen' he said, using one of the terms of en dearment rare between them. ' I am your son ; I can never do that.' He walked to her side and remained there, leaning against her knee, as if he were standing up for her before the whole world. ' You know it is not for the horses and dogs that Uncle Arthur says are at my grand father's place, which on his death came to me, because my father was my Uncle Arthur's elder brother, and I am my father's son,' he reminded her. ' Uncle Arthur has been telling me all about it, and he says you would not have minded, or held"], [90, "78 RACHEL LANGTON it unfair, if my father had lived and he had got Langton Hall. It was because I was such a little chap \u2014 a mere baby then \u2014 that it did sound horribly absurd for older people to have to give way to me. But I shall grow as old as anybody if I live ; I will do my best, and it must be right to try, particularly when Uncle Arthur says that no refusing to try and to take what is ours will make it his or Aunt Agatha's. I asked him and he said, \" No, certainly not, my boy ; besides I am quite content to be your Rector.\" Ask him yourself, mother.' She did not speak ; she stood there, dumb and troubled. Caleb spoke again, his piping voice beginning to shake a little between excitement and weakness, while he had to lean more and more against her knee. ' Mother, you don't think that I care so much for change, or for being a squire like my grandfather, and having carriages and servants and money ? ' he appealed to her earnestly. ' You know I don't care a bit any more than you care ; and even for the things I do mind about, I could give them up if I tried a little hard. You have taught me to give up things and to feel a braver and happier boy without them, if they were not for me. Why, I don't care for going to England and Langton Hall so much as that comes to, though I should like to be with Uncle Arthur and Aunt Agatha again. I am afraid I have forgotten what she is like ; but Uncle Arthur"], [91, "THE INEVITABLE 79 says she has not forgotten me, and will be so glad to hear of me and you too, of course. You have often told me she was more beautiful and noble and sweet than any princess. When I have read of princesses I have always thought of Aunt Agatha.' ' You are right there,' his mother acquiesced gravely. ' You said yourself it was nice for me to see Uncle Arthur, and I should like to see my beautiful, gracious Aunt Agatha. But I should be sorry not to go back to the gymnasium. We have not fin ished the map of Germany which we were to do this year, and I wanted to hear the end of how Rudolph was made emperor. And I should be very sorry to bid good-bye to Max and Fritz. Oh, Max was to get one of Kohlrabenschwartf s kittens ; we must take care to remember that,' he broke off meditatively before he repeated what was to him the unanswerable argument. ' Still, if we get a task to do, we ought not to shirk it without trying, ought we, mother ? ' 'Then we will try, Caleb,' said Rachel Langton, faintly. So she put her house in order and went humbly back with Arthur, owning she had been rash and headstrong, perhaps wicked, and she was return ing to atone for her error, if that were possible. She was a great enough woman in her very narrow ness to confess herself in fault, and to seek to atone. Mr Seacombe said, with his wig on one side, it"], [92, "80 RACHEL LANGTON was a blessing a woman with a tete exalte'e had re covered her senses. The worst of it was that he had grave doubts of her not committing some equally wild escapade before she had done with this mad world. In fact, he could not forgive the Rector of Langton for having hit on the mother and child whom legal emissaries had so long been hunting up in vain. There was great joy on the part of Agatha and Arthur over their recovered king and his queen mother. It was such genuine joy that Agatha Etheredge almost forgot to be troubled about what the world, which had just ceased to marvel over their singular disappearance, would say at the lost being found. There was such hearty liking and loyalty from Caleb's kindred for the old-fashioned, quaintly, wise young king, that no mother's heart could re sist the tribute. Rachel submitted to the inevit able, to the necessity of consenting, in Caleb's name, to take what was his. She no longer dreaded that a curse would fall on him for robbing his own flesh. She felt assured that, in eleven years' time, when he was of age, her child would scrupulously fulfil every tittle of his grandfather's instructions.

Could compliance go farther ? And inasmuch as Rachel did it for Caleb, and for what she at last believed was right, she herself was benefited by the compliance. Her high, stubborn spirit had to bend and break in the frequent consultations held with the Rector, Mrs Etheredge and Mr Seacombe, when everything befitting the heir of Langton Hall was done for Caleb, in order that the compliance might not degenerate into a mere mockery of yielding. Mrs Gerald could do nothing by halves, there fore her own nature was widened and mellowed by what is often the truest and most abiding victory, the victory of the vanquished. F"], [94, ""], [95, "PART II THE SQUIRE'S MOTHER"], [96, ""], [97, "CHAPTER I LIFE'S CHANGES At forty-six years of age, Rachel Langton was a handsome woman, dignified in her simplicity. There was little beyond a certain reserve along with a brusqueness of manner which remained with her, to distinguish her from other squires' mothers. These, too, were presiding over their sons' houses till the young men should take to themselves wives, when the mothers would sub side willingly, or unwillingly, into the position of dowagers, drafted into family dowager-houses or their equivalents. At the time Rachel came first to Langton Hall as Gerald's widow, a young woman whose importance was due solely to the fact that she was the mother of the old squire's heir, she had to a large extent declined to mix in society under the wing of her sister-in-law, Miss Langton. Rachel had repudiated with some scorn what she considered the frivolous occupations and artificial forms and ceremonies appertaining to her acquired rank. The exception had been when she was constrained to observe them out of respect for the head of the house and reluctant liking S5"], [98, "86 RACHEL LANGTON for his son and daughter, who were ready, if Rachel would, to be good friends to their newly acknowledged relation. She had not taken at all kindly to the distinctions and luxuries sud denly thrust upon her. She had wound up her re bellion by an outrage against propriety in fleeing with her son from the honours accorded to the unconscious child by established law and custom, He could not hold them without defrauding his relatives better entitled to the succession, according to her primitive, austere judgment. For she was, by education and inheritance, part Spartan, part Puritan. But all this was changed ; Rachel Langton had seen herself compelled to give in. Life and its complications had been too much for her ; she had not been equal to them in her courage and endur ance. They might have served for herself they did not serve for Caleb. She had found herself called upon to restore him to his rightful position as Squire of Langton Hall, she had felt bound by her duty and devotion to her son to return with him and help him to bear the burden of the obliga tions imposed upon him. In the course of assisting in the discharge of these obligations she had made many concessions, and in yielding her own will and opinion to the will and opinion of others, she had, without being aware of it, softened in various respects. The angles of her strong individuality were rubbed off,"], [99, "LIFE'S CHANGES 87 till in manners and habits, even in dress, she grew much more like her present equals. She had nothing to learn from them in the education which is not the mere commerce of society. In what pertained to book knowledge she had always been rather above than beneath their level. She ac cepted the situation for her son's sake, and she sented to practise the lawful ways of the world in which he was to move, and to make the ac quaintance of the neighbours and friends who were in time to be his neighbours and friends. They, on their part, were not wanting in civil over tures, in some measure over-mastered by curiosity. They were in a still greater measure influenced by the fact that Arthur Langton, the present rector of the parish, and his sister had from the first upheld their eccentric sister-in-law. The Lang tons continued to lend her all the backing afforded by the family's old standing in the county, and by the brother and sister's personal popularity. After Mrs Gerald had progressed into Mrs Lang ton and had conquered her inexplicable objection to being mistress of Langton Hall, she became, whether she would or not, the principal represen tative of the family for the time, and, as such, public property where the county was concerned. The visitors who sought her after she had emerged from the unknown retreat in which she had taken refuge, found her not so very alarming after all. A handsome woman of so severe a cast of"], [100, "88 RACHEL LANGTON beauty that she could afford to be simple to severity in her style, very grave and quiet, far too much so ever to rival her charming sister-in-law in public favour. Mrs Langton was a little abrupt, perhaps, a little sarcastic in her silence, for she kept her tongue well under control \u2014 a woman to be respected with a soupcon of fear. She was not otherwise objectionable in her originality, and she was no more vulgar than Agatha Langton, the daintiest of county belles, had been vulgar. It was on the cards that Mrs Langton might show herself in the long run possessed of more sterling qualities than were to be found in many much more agreeable people. Anyhow, she was quite fit to be supported ; she could be invited to county dinners and garden parties without the slightest fear that she would be a blot on the wor shipful company. She was somewhat chary in accepting invitations. She seemed to have an antiquated idea that her widowhood was an ample apology for not entertaining company in return, so long as her son was young, but she did not in other respects go against established precedents. She could not be called lively or entertaining according to country-house standards. She was cold and formal, but if she had an air of solid superiority it was so unconscious and so little obtruded on people's notice that it failed to irritate. Mrs Langton could be safely asked to subscribe to all local interests and charities and to take part"], [101, "LIFE'S CHANGES 89 in local functions of a purely benevolent nature \u2014 such as the opening of a working-men's institute, the inaugurating of a cottage hospital, any scheme for encouraging cottage gardening and poultry keeping, etc., etc. For she was not only a liberal woman in the sense of an open purse and some public spirit, she was well-informed and practical as indeed one might have expected a clergyman's daughter, an ex-teacher of youth, to show herself. As time wore on, and little Caleb Langton grew big Caleb, and progressed from Harrow to Oxford and back to Langton Hall, where he was to rule as a rural potentate, a squire of a considerable number of acres, the necessity of cultivating Mrs Langton, the squire's mother, became still more strongly impressed upon the public mind. Rachel was, whether she would or not, a personage in her circle. She might have been still more courted and made much of, had it not been for some of her inveterate peculiarities \u2014 the strain of austerity in her temper, her hatred of fuss and palaver. With all the acquaintances she was fated to make, her chief friend and confidential adviser was not Mr Seacombe, the family lawyer. He had grown in his old age to hold her not quite the fool he had once thought her, but a mixture of fool and wise woman \u2014 a combination which he had learnt in his great experience to recognise as neither al together exceptional nor abnormal. Her stay on the uncongenial road she was destined to tread, was"], [102, "RACHEL LANGTON 90 her brother-in-law and rector, the Rev. Arthur Langton. She had been at one time even passion ately fond of his sister Agatha, whose fascination extended both to men and women, but Mrs Ether edge's home was with her husband and family in town. It was only during the spring or autumn recesses that she appeared as a fleeting visitor at the Hall or the Rectory, or established herself and her belongings for a longer stay in any of the neighbouring country houses which happened to be vacant. The Rev. Arthur, who was a stay-at-home, working clergyman, was always at hand to advise his sister-in-law and control and guide his nephew. For a long time the friendship between two per sons so innately and widely dissimilar as Arthur and Rachel Langton continued unbroken. It sur vived Arthur's marriage to a rural dean's daughter. She was a pretty, unsophisticated girl, gentle in temper and delicate in physique, who claimed and received all the consideration and tenderness which stronger people could give her. The friendship flourished apace when poor young Mrs Arthur faded and died, sedulously, nay, lov ingly, nursed by Rachel Langton. The sorrowing widower was left with three little children. They formed for the hour an additional tie between the Hall and the Rectory. Rachel adopted them in their need, and lavished on them the unslumbering care and regard she had bestowed on her own boy. It appeared that the friendship between the"], [103, "LIFE'S CHANGES 91 Rector and Mrs Langton was so fast-rooted that it could not be shaken, yet one fine day it all but snapped. It was the day when Arthur Langton announced that he was about to wed a second wife. He was to give to his motherless children a step- mother in the person of the high - spirited, gay- tempered daughter of a fox-hunting squire in the vicinity. She was still in her teens ; she had followed the hounds with her father since she could sit on her pony. She was the Diana of the hunting-field, championed by all the fox-hunters far and near ; she was the light-hearted belle of the hunt balls and of every other occasion for gaiety which pre- sented itself. Her family were more remarkable for thoughtlessness and hot-headed impulsiveness than for discretion or sobriety. Nothing worse was known of her, but Rachel could not imagine a more ill-suited wife for a clergyman, a more undesirable step-mother for young children. The whole affair of the marriage was eminently distasteful and detestable to Rachel. She was as dogmatic as the Vicar of Wakefield had been in holding that one wife was enough for one man, one husband for one woman. She herself had never swerved for a second from the faith she had pledged to Caleb's father. She could not under stand that sympathetic pliability and adaptability in Arthur Langton's nature, which led him to ap preciate, in turn, a drooping violet, and a blooming, well-nigh a flaunting rose, a meek, subdued creature,"], [104, "92 RACHEL LANGTON like the wife he had lost, and a buoyant, irrepres sible beauty, and rattle rather than wit, such as had captivated him in his second choice. Rachel could not forgive what she had called, in her heart, his fatal facility in being pleased, his unblushing faithlessness. She had learnt to idealise the meek Mrs Arthur who was gone, as Rachel had with even less reason idealised her dead husband. It was abhorrent to her that Arthur Langton should thus degrade himself, impair his usefulness, and lower his character in her eyes. In Rachel's mind he falsified the vows which he had pledged not so long ago, by placing another woman, and a very different woman, in his dead wife's place. It was all very well for him to protest, with an angry flush on his cheeks and moisture rising in his eyes, that he had not forgotten his first love. He continued to take her children to her grave. He prevented her successor, softly and quietly, but not the less irresistibly, from sweeping away, in her triumphal, heedless progress, every landmark which her predecessor had left behind her. But Rachel could not excuse the necessity for the palli ation of an unjustifiable course which to her seemed vulgarly common \u2014 alike in high and low places. It was not the less repulsive to a loyal, tenacious mind. And it was not as if Arthur Langton were a mere unstable lad such as Caleb was. Arthur had reached, or ought to have reached, the years of maturity, steadfastness and endurance. There"], [105, "LIFE'S CHANGES 93 were a streak or two of silver in his hair; his old, lithe figure was gaining in an approach to portliness what it was losing in elasticity. Why, he was not so very much younger than Rachel herself was ! The more shame to him that he could not set himself in patience to bear the deso lation of his hearth, or tutor himself to be father and mother in one to his motherless children. All that Agatha said with smiling lips and brimming eyes was that poor dear Arthur felt too lonely. He had been the kindest of husbands to dearest Maud, and he would never cease to cherish her sainted memory. But there was nothing wonderful or unnatural in his seeking some solace for his sorrow, some relief to his bereavement. Dear Eleanor was a bright, light-hearted girl, she would enliven the Rectory inexpressibly. She would cheer both the children and their father. She would be a pleasant, sprightly young companion and kinswoman for Rachel herself. Ah ! yes. Eleanor's heart and principles were in the right place. Why doubt it ? She would respond to Arthur's teach ing ; she would develop into an excellent wife fora clergyman. She had youth and health, and gently born, generous antecedents on her side. There was no fear for Eleanor, any more than for Arthur. Mrs Langton at the Hall listened grimly. To her there was something wonderful and unnatural in Arthur Langton's marrying again, and in his choosing such a wife."], [106, "94 RACHEL LANGTON Of course, Rachel made no objection. She was too just a woman to arrogate to herself a title to interfere which did not exist. Arthur Langton was far more than of age. Without doubt he was at liberty to judge for himself. But from that day a barrier rose up between him and his sister-in-law which he strove in vain to surmount or overthrow, for he had much cordial esteem and even grateful affection for his brother's widow. Thenceforth the chief bond between them was the young squire. Rachel put force upon herself in order to renounce the prominent part she had taken in caring for the Rector's little children ; she took pains that the new guardian he had given them should be left free to perform her office, well or ill. Mrs Arthur at the Rectory was not slow to see and resent the disapproving eyes with which Mrs Langton at the Hall viewed her instalment into her new dignities and responsibilities. Mrs Langton in herself, in her origin and nurture, was wholly anti- pathetic to Mrs Arthur. What right had the elder woman to censure the younger ? It must be said, in her consciousness of the censure, Mrs Arthur did not fail to supply grounds for it, and to behave in such a way as to render the polite hostility permanent. A lively, somewhat spoilt girl, really attached to the handsome, agreeable Rector, touched, though she would have been the last to own it, by the sentimental interest of his position, genuinely desirous to make up to him for"], [107, "LIFE'S CHANGES 95 the wife he had lost, and to be a friend to the poor little children, she rushed to the opposite extreme, for no other purpose, as it seemed, than to justify Rachel Langton's dislike to the match. Mrs Arthur Langton continued to follow the hounds, whenever the hunt was within half a day's distance of the Rectory. She even beguiled the Rector into appearing in the field three times for every once he had shown himself at the meets, or sacrified a day to sport since he had taken orders. She consti tuted herself the great patroness of balls, dances, tennis and skating parties. She filled the Rectory with company \u2014 not always the best selected \u2014 on the smallest pretences. She left the children largely to nurses and governesses. She neglected her housekeeping and entrusted it to subordinates as careless and thoughtless as herself. She enticed her yielding husband into all sorts of needless ex travagance. Even Caleb's scrupulous fulfilment of his grandfather's intentions, when the young man came of age, would not suffice to free the Rector from permanent embarrassments dishonouring to his character and profession. Mrs Arthur did not dream of being an example to the parish. She took only the most fitful and fugitive interest in the good works of which a clergyman's wife is expected to be the centre. Withal, if the root of the lady's errors had been reached, it would have been discovered to be a vola tile temperament, together with an ardent, indignant"], [108, "96 RACHEL LANGTON necessity to fly in the face of Mrs Langton of the Hall, and do despite to her opinions and practices. Who or what was she, a ci-devant schoolmistress, the daughter of a humbly-born, out-at-elbows, Low Church curate, though she happened to be the young squire's mother, that she should sit an judg ment on the daughter of one of the oldest families in the shire, a family at least as old and as popular as that of the Langtons any day ? Arthur could tell his prim, precise sister-in-law all that, if heliked. Agatha Etheredge, who was worth athousand inter lopers and upstarts, could bear her testimony also. Unfortunately Mrs Arthur did not stop short at going her own way \u2014 a way diametrically opposed to that of Mrs Langton. The younger woman was neither so just nor so discreet as the elder. When the two ladies met, at longer and longer intervals, with a show of courtesy, in each other's houses and on neutral ground, Mrs Arthur did not hesitate to discharge her small artillery of smart speeches, prettily impertinent insinuations, airily inoppor tune raillery, and lightly malicious sarcasms at her opponent. This was to the enemy's face, without the Rev. Arthur's being able to prevent the attacks, though he was not hardened into ceas ing to feel discomposed and distressed by them. Neither could he stop his wife from ridiculing his sister-in-law behind her back, mimicking what Mrs Arthur called Mrs Langton's ' solemn airs,' laugh ing at her in season and out of season."], [109, "LIFE'S CHANGES 97 Gradually Arthur Langton owned with a sigh that it was better that the communication between the Hall and the Rectory should dwindle to a mere form, unless when Agatha Etheredge was visiting at either house or temporarily settled in the neigh bourhood, when the moribund intercourse was gal vanised into fitful life. Had it not been for Caleb Langton, over whom his uncle still exercised a remnant of influence, which represented the author ity the Rector wielded over the lad in his minority, the old ties of kindred and friendship, worn thin, would have perished. But Caleb was still, inad vertently as it were, the peacemaker, the preserver of the lapsing family relations ; nobody had any quarrel with Caleb. His uncle was rather inclined to exaggerate his nephew's importance as the head of the family, the possessor of a good estate, which the lad's sense of justice and generosity in con ferring on the elder members the portions which had been destined for them had not sensibly im paired. For the careful nursing of a long minority had freed the encumbered estate and increased its master's resources. On this account, as well as on others, the Rector was nervously anxious to retain such hold as he yet had over the young man. Mrs Arthur liked him, was rather proud of him, and to her credit did not seek to set him against his mother, any more than Rachel Langton tried to sever her son from his father's relations. Perhaps the greater magnanimity in this non-in- G"], [110, "98 RACHEL LANGTON terference was Rachel's, for she had been driven to fall back on her son as all that was left to her of vital concern in this world. Mrs Arthur had many friends \u2014 including her indulgent husband and the step-children, whom she petted and played with when she was not tempted to forget their existence. God had not given her children of her own, but He had granted her numerous indem nifications. Rachel Langton had only her boy, for whom she had travailed in spirit, thought and prayed, ever since he was born. She had devoted herself to him, sacrificed herself for him, given up her cherished independence, her proud self-reliance, her strongest prejudices and partialities, that she might not stand in his way, that he might not fail in the part which she had been brought to believe he was called on to play. She had lived an alien among aliens, separated from all her early asso ciations and connections, for his sake. As yet Rachel had not missed her reward. The bond between mother and son was still close and firm as ever, though, in the reticence and undemon strativeness in which they resembled each other, their affection was even less displayed on the sur face than it had been in the days of Caleb's child hood. Then Arthur and Agatha Langton had been inclined to pity the small boy for the stern discipline to which he was subjected. Caleb Langton had passed through his public school and college life not merely with credit but"], [111, "LIFE'S CHANGES 99 with some honour, though not quite the amount of distinction which might have been expected from his broad brow, deep-set eyes and square chin. The fact was that, as in the case of so many young men of more than average intellect, his attention had been a good deal distracted from pure scholar ship by pressing social questions \u2014 the claims of the day in which he lived. But in this matter his mother and uncle agreed in being fairly satisfied. Rachel Langton was tempted to feel a certain con tempt for mere scholarship. Arthur Langton did not see any advantage, rather a loss, in the Squire of Langton Hall progressing into a refined book worm. So far, Caleb's kindred were of one mind ; but beyond the single point of agreement there was a wide divergence. The Rector was only too thankful, not merely that his nephew had con ducted himself very creditably where his morals and manners were concerned, but that he had not exhibited anything abnormal or eccentric in his career. This was a conclusion which might have been dreaded from his progenitors on one side of the house, and from certain peculiarities in his early training. He had certainly departed from the traditional politics of the Langtons, who had always been Conservatives, while Caleb announced himself a Liberal. But the terms Tory and Whig, or Conservative and Liberal, had suffered many modifications and accomplished many compromises in recent years, and the Rector was too liberal-"], [112, "RACHEL LANGTON 100 minded himself in his hereditary creed to object strongly to the young Squire's making a new de parture in the family politics. After the fashion of many a lad in the same position, Caleb had delivered a few speeches at the Union, which, in the middle of their youthful cleverness, his uncle could have wished unsaid, because of their dog matism, which was as great as their enthusiasm. But these might be taken as the heady effervescence of his age and the generation in which he lived \u2014 an effervescence which would soon exhaust itself. In the meantime, his tutor reported well of Caleb. He had led, on the whole, very much the active, cheer ful, many-sided life of a promising undergraduate. It was this very similarity to his ordinary well disposed contemporaries, in which Arthur Langton rejoiced, that cost Rachel some pangs. Her boy was a good boy, and for that she was devoutly thankful, but she had meant him to be something more than a fairly worthy young squire. She feared that he was settling down into the usual well-worn ruts in which his class moved. He was letting go what he had derived from her and her forefathers, which might have constituted him some thing different, something rousing and reforming in his day and sphere.

She read with qualms of dismay Caleb's brief but keenly-interested accounts of cricket and football matches and boating without end. Such recreations were necessary for his health and manliness, his Uncle Arthur insisted : they were part of the established routine of the uni versity. And certainly Caleb was a muscular young Christian, as tall and broad-shouldered a man as his mother was a woman \u2014 'a comely creature,' withal, as he exhibited his version of his mother's strong, handsome face, in his case, brown and ruddy with youth, health and exercise. Nevertheless the system troubled Rachel. Not thus had her father toiled and studied in his poverty to win the degree which was to enable him to take Orders. Not thus had her brothers fought their way to knowledge through their commercial schools. Why, Caleb took things so lightly that he had even found time and inclination to join the uni versity dramatic society, and share in its represen tations. He went to concerts and balls as if they formed part of his education. His mother could not help recalling, sometimes with anxious regret savouring of remorse, her old dream \u2014 when she was a teacher at the school in Mittesheim, and little Caleb was a pupil in the gymnasium \u2014 that he might be delivered from temptation, and content to be a gifted and devout Lutheran pastor, keeping his sheep in the wilderness."], [114, "102 CHAPTER II AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR Agatha Etheredge and summer \u2014 the associa tion was perfect in many people's minds. Agatha ' become two bands,' as she was pleased to de scribe the growth of her household, was fond of coming back to her old neighbourhood. When she was down for more than a week or ten days, she found quarters for her increasing establishment in any of the country houses round, which were in a house-agent's hands. There she settled herself and her belongings contentedly, and immediately proceeded to show herself as charming as she had been in her maiden days, when she presided over Langton Hall and made sunshine in its darkened rooms for her old father and young brother. She was even more delightful than ever, for she was in the full bloom of her matronly happiness and prosperity. The high-bred, somewhat unpractical lover of her youth had risen above the cloud of adverse circumstances which had for a time threat ened to extinguish a luminary of its kind. He had earned distinction and won esteem where both of the great political parties were concerned. He"], [115, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 103 held at present one of those minor posts under Government, which are generally supposed to be stepping-stones to any height in statesmanship. However honoured and valued, however busy, he never failed in his quiet devotion to his wife. Agatha Etheredge was very happy in her husband, and very proud of his final emergence from the shoals and quicksands of poverty and obscurity, with which, in spite of his genius for certain de partments of governing, he had been unable to cope. She was happy in her children \u2014 fine boys and girls not yet emancipated from public schools and governesses. She enjoyed returning to her old neighbourhood and displaying, not so much boastfully as with glad gratitude, her domestic and social success. There was as little as possible of arrogance and egotism in this innocent exhibition. Agatha had never been more amiable, less puffed up by her own gifts and attainments, more brim ming over with sympathy for less well endowed and less lucky neighbours. Prosperity suited her better than it suits most people. She was more carefully considerate of the feelings of others, more exquisitely gentle and sweet-tempered than ever. If there were shades to the picture, if her dainty loveliness and graciousness were more mannered and artificial than formerly; if the conventionality of nurture and culture, which had always been present in her, had developed in her, without any clear consciousness of its existence on her part,"], [116, "104 RACHEL LANGTON an amount of virtuous worldliness, of dominant maxims grounded much more on the laws of con venance than on the rules of the higher morality, very few people detected the flaw. To her family and connections Agatha Etheredge had always been specially winning. It was to be expected that the Rev. Arthur should brighten up like a boy at the prospect of his sister's arrival. He could carry all his troubles and difficulties to her, as sure of an interested auditor as when he carried to her his boyish grievances. Her womanly tact, tenderness and liberality would remove the obstacle with his bishop, would lift him over the difficulty with his churchwarden, would supply what was wanting to the fund for restoring his chancel. He knew also that he would be soothed and cheered in the rubs and worries of everyday life by that later spring of faith and hope which her good fortune in all respects \u2014 the blessing of God upon her he and she called it reverently \u2014 had brought to the front in Agatha's formerly rather subdued nature. As for his wife, she was nearly as fond of Agatha as he was. Agatha, without any intention of doing so, could well-nigh turn Mrs Arthur round her finger. If that very unclerical lady would take advice from anyone it would be from ' darling Agatha.' Lenient as the Rector was to his wife's faults, he could not deny that she would be the better of receiving advice, and follow ing it, sometimes. Mrs Arthur was on her best be-"], [117, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 105 haviour when she was under the influence of Mrs Etheredge. It might have been expected, and the expecta tion was not baulked, that the young Squire, who had from his boyhood entertained a great admira tion and regard for his aunt, which his mother had fostered, not checked, would be delighted to have her near him for a time, that he might bask in all the novelty, variety and animation which her pre sence implied. Even Rachel Langton softened and smiled over the coming of Agatha, her distinguished husband and her pleasant young people. They were all so nice as Caleb's kindred, and if there should be some danger in their very attractions, the Etheredges' stay was in general too brief to allow the danger to wax serious. How could his mother grudge Caleb so lawful an indulgence as the companyof his relatives ? If anything could have added to Agatha's satis faction in returning for a season to her old circle, it was the unanimity of the welcome she got. It was in her to be all things to all men, and she laid herself out with the utmost zest to meet everybody's demands on her friendship, and to make everybody happy. This year the Etheredges were coming to Rye lands \u2014 an old-fashioned house situated about mid way between Langton Hall and Langton Rectory. Ryelands was not particularly commodious, while it was hardly old enough to be very picturesque,"], [118, "106 RACHEL LANGTON but it did well enough for a couple of months. It simply tickled Agatha to fit herself and her brood into its limited, ill-arranged space. It enchanted her to contrive that her unconscious husband's modest requirements should be satisfied, whatever became of his wife and family. It was delightful, in the way of variety, to prove satisfactorily how pretty and comfortable everything could be made to look out of the most slender materials. ' That is the true triumph of the decorator's art,' she proclaimed triumphantly. ' Really, the old gardens, the crazy greenhouse and the paddock for a park, with sheep for deer, are idyllic after \u2014 not Park Lane, we are not half rich enough for Park Lane \u2014 after the dull, dingy square in the vicinity, with which we have to content ourselves, don't you know, dear ? ' a confidential appeal which she made to whatever old friend she might be addressing. Cabel Langton had been to the nearest station to meet and greet his aunt on the evening of her arrival. It was the same little station to which his grandfather had gone on the spring evening to make his first acquaintance with Caleb and Caleb's mother. It was the same rustic platform as that from which Rachel had fled in the dim haze of an autumn morning, receding fast and far in the long vista of years, when she took the illegal step of carrying off the heir of Langton Hall that she might save him from the commission of a legal iniquity. On the present occasion the young man"], [119, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 107 encountered his uncle bound on the same errand. After just waiting to greet the travellers, Caleb gave way to his senior, leaving him master of the situation and free to escort Mrs Etheredge to Rye lands. Mr Etheredge was not among her numer ous ' encumbrances ' ; he was detained in town still. The Rector and Mrs Etheredge were such a par ticularly attached brother and sister that he was the best entitled to hail and appropriate her. But the first thing which Caleb proposed to his mother during breakfast next morning was that she should drive her over after lunch to call on her sister-in-law. Rachel was nothing loth, and agreed readily to the proposal. She, too, felt disposed to bask in the caressing sunshine of Agatha's presence. ' Had your aunt anyone with her except the boys and girls, Caleb ? ' his mother asked as she ate the bread and milk which she preferred to the stewed mushrooms and pigeon pie with which her son was breaking his fast. ' I hear Mr Etheredge is not expected till the end of the month ; but your aunt has generally some special friend to bear her company in his absence. I used to think, when I knew her first, that I had never come across any body with so many special friends.' ' Were they all specials ? ' inquired Caleb, with the half-suppressed smile which was a reflection of his mother's, without being nearly so grave as hers was. Your account gives the idea of a general collec-"], [120, "108 RACHEL LANGTON tion \u2014 a sort of omnium gatherum of friends. But I suppose some people do have a number of bosom friends, with not one jealous of the other. I have known men with no end of chums who never doubted their Damon's particular regard, though it was shared by a multitude.' ' As to the jealousy I cannot tell, but certainly Agatha is a friendly creature,' said Mrs Langton, meditatingly. ' Leaving the question of many or few friends out,' resumed Caleb, deliberately, helping himself to more pie, 'there was a lady with Aunt Agathalast evening, a tall, fair-haired girl, I never saw before. She was only mentioned to me in the hurry as one of our cousins. She must be a cousin on Etheredge's side of the house, there are no more Langtons to be come acquainted with, I take it' He turned care lessly to call his dog to order. ' No, Marcus Aurelius, you are not to have these bones ; you are no longer finishing your college course in registered lodgings in Ship Street ; you are in a lady's break fast-room, and you must do your master credit by behaving in a gentleman-like manner.' ' Give the dog what it wants and has been accustomed to, I don't mind, unless it puts out Webster,' naming the butler. ' No, there are no more of the Langton connection that I am aware of to make the acquaintance of.' There was a slight tone of relief in her voice which she seemed to realise, for which she proceeded to take herself to"], [121, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 109 task with the self-discipline she had practised since her girlhood. ' Caleb, I have seen the day when your father's family stood up in rather a formidable array be fore me. But, I am bound to confess, that was ere I knew them,' she explained candidly; 'when I did know them I found them ready to make allowance and to be true friends.' ' I have no doubt that the benefit was mutual, mother,' said Caleb, with a shade of gruffness in his youthful manliness. He had every respect for his father's kindred, but he did not like his mother to depreciate herself. He did not care \u2014 or he believed he did not care \u2014 for the strain of plebeian blood which she had given him. He was proud of her in a peculiar way. He hated that she should undervalue herself, or tempt other people to undervalue her. Not his Aunt Agatha, though she had been the fairy princess of his childhood, and he still admired her excessively, stood on the same level as his mother in his estimation. Mother and son did not always agree. They showed a not unfrequent tendency to pull different ways, because, for one reason, the yeoman and trades man's blood, with its hereditary instincts and asso ciations, was not unmixed in Caleb's veins. There was another element contending with it, the pro duct of long generations of county magnates and autocratic squires \u2014 absolute monarchs in their domains. The two streams mingling, yet warring,"], [122, "110 RACHEL LANGTON in the same channel, were further modified and moulded by the traditions and training of a great public school and a university. Caleb Langton was a different lad with different standards and aims from what he must have been if he had come fresh from the gymnasium at Mittesheim. But whatever transformation his Uncle Arthur, with his rooted country gentleman's notions of what a young squire's education ought to be, had been able to work in Caleb, he had not, as he had never wished to do, turned the ' young fellow ' against his mother, or lowered her by an inch from the pedestal on which the boy had set her. She was still the most sensible, independent, unselfish woman he had known. Her moderation and un affected indifference to the trifles which make up so many women's lives, recommended themselves to his youthful judgment. He honoured as well as loved her, for was she not worthy of honour in the simplicity and sincerity which made no disguise of her origin and natural sentiments, and in the dis interestedness which thought so much of his welfare, and so little of her own inclinations? Caleb was proud of his mother. He had enough spirit and heart to be so, though she sometimes perplexed, sometimes provoked him, for he had gone considerably beyond her unworldly gauge of all things. He regarded the world from a much more artificial standpoint. After luncheon, Caleb drove his mother in her"], [123, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR III pony phaeton over to Ryelands. Such a drive was one of the few privileges of her position which she thoroughly enjoyed. She was getting suffi ciently middle-aged to feel less pleasure in walking for walking's sake than she had felt twenty years earlier. She had improved on the dense ignorance of horses, which had struck even Agatha Langton, in her tolerance, as one of the signs of poor Rachel's narrow, underbred experience. Mrs Langton was now not only able to tell a roan from a sorrel and a bay, she had acquired, as a matter of convenience, the art of driving her own ponies. But she greatly preferred when Caleb drove them for her. The coachman's accomplish ments \u2014 on which she did not put the smallest weight when she practised one of them herself \u2014 she secretly admired, mother-like, in him, just as she admired his riding, and what she had heard of his agility and skill in sport, while she could not help regarding them as waste of time, and worse. She was not a vegetarian, she was only the most temperate of women in ordinary food and drink. She thought the injunction to subdue and kill the wild creatures of the fields, woods and rivers was still binding where man's sustenance was concerned. She was by no means so sure that it was justifiable to slay the lower creation for man's amusement. She had doubts of men's warrant for fighting with their fellows, unless in self-defence. She had strongly and successfully"], [124, "112 RACHEL LANGTON opposed the Rev. Arthur's suggestion that perhaps it might be better for Caleb to enter the army and see a little of the world and of military service before he settled down as the Squire of Langton Hall. But it was not so much the standing to be shot at in his own person, or the obligation to shoot his neighbour \u2014 bad as that was \u2014 to which Rachel had an utter distaste. It was what she had read of the shallow parade and noisy frivolity of officers' quarters, in barracks, in the piping times of peace. All that was left at a distance. When her son was driving her through the ripening fields in the late July afternoon to Ryelands, she had her boy entirely to herself, granted that she ought to be ashamed of so selfish a consideration. Both had a keen enjoyment of the open air and of the soft sweeps of pasture land, of waving corn, and of leafy covert which constituted the English scenery they traversed. They were therefore as much in harmony as they could be. The fact that the road wound for a considerable distance through Caleb's property, only added to the satis faction of the drive. The consciousness of pos session had not begun to pall on the young man. In addition to a country-bred lad's love of every thing rural, he knew not only the farmhouses, but the fields, ponds, quarries and cottages. He was still full of those unsophisticated schemes for the land and its occupants, which ought to render the"], [125, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 113 schemer a good landlord in his generation. Such a result would alone vindicate, in his mother's eyes, his position as the Squire of Langton. In the middle of her pleasure in the drives Rachel Langton looked up suddenly. ' Do you know this is your Aunt Agatha's old phaeton ? ' she said. ' Which accounts for the old-fashioned ram shackleness of the small trap,' replied Caleb, with the zealous addiction of his years to all last devices and new discoveries, whether in phaetons or in the modes of ruling kingdoms. ' I wonder if she would like to have it over at Ryelands while she is there ? ' went on Rachel with the brightness of one who has hit on an acceptable idea. ' She would not mind the old-fashionedness of the little carriage. She might have the ponies over also, though, of course, they are not her old ponies, those were put out to grass long ago. I be lieve one of them is still alive in its land of Beulah.' ' My dear mother, what are you thinking of? ' demanded Caleb, a little impatiently. ' There is excellent stabling at Ryelands ; it is the principal reason why the old place lets well. Aunt Agatha is a woman of fashion, a stylish, fine lady, though I admit she is something more. She has the very smartest turn-out of her own in the shape of a phaeton and ponies. I saw it the last time I was up in town. I believe it was a birthday present from Etheredge.

Besides, what are you going to do yourself if you send away, for the better part of the summer, the only thing you care to drive in?' ' I can walk. I have been accustomed to walk,' she said quickly. ' Not in my day ; not for many a day at least,' he corrected her, 'and you don't mean to confine yourself to that doleful hearse of an old carriage which my grandfather did not do away with, or to a T- cart at your time of life ? ' She was forced to laugh. 'Don't be impertin ent, and don't flippantly disparage your stock of carriages.' ' A shabby lot. I should be ashamed to be seen in any one of them,' proclaimed the young potentate. ' They are good enough for me,' maintained Mrs Langton. 1 Yes, mother, but think of my credit as a fellow of liberality and taste in touch with the times. I say,' mischievously, ' you are not speaking by way of a hint, are you ? You don't mean that I ought to run up to town and look out for a new pumpkin and pair of mice for you ? ' ' No, no ; I like this best,' asserted Rachel, with conviction ; ' and if you think your Aunt Agatha would not care for the loan I proposed to make, why, then, it need not be made.'"], [127, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 115 But Mrs Langton and not her son was right in the argument. Mrs Etheredge would have cared for the old phaeton as a bit of the old life, though she would have objected to depriving Rachel of it, and after Agatha had used it once or twice, the incongruity of its shabbiness might have jarred upon her delicate perceptions. Caleb Langton and his mother found the whole house-party idling about the lawn at Ryelands. It was a very pretty though circumscribed lawn, with quite a tall, thick screen of flowering shrubs round it. The lawn showed a reflection of the quaint rusticity of the white house itself. It dis gusted all rich parvenus and would-be tenants from Manchester and Birmingham, but delighted the soul of Agatha Etheredge and people like her who, whenever they come into the country, are fond of playing at life in villagiatura. The family supposed themselves still too fatigued by their yesterday's journey, in the ease and swiftness of a couple of Pullman's carriages, and an impeccable railway line, to be able to do more than dawdle about the front of the house and look at what re mained of the roses. The single exception not quite contented with the arrangement was the tall, blonde girl who had come in Mrs Etheredge's train- She stood a little apart from the others and gazed wistfully through an opening in the massed to gether shrubs \u2014 Portugal laurels, lilacs and syringas, away over the pleasant stretch of country"], [128, "116 RACHEL LANGTON across which Mrs Langton and her son had driven. Agatha Etheredge gave a little cry of genuine satisfaction, and hastened to meet her visitors. ' So kind and dear of you, Rachel, to come so soon, and to bring Caleb. I had hardly time last evening to give him a look to see if the great creature had grown any bigger. I could not ask him a single question as to how you were faring at the dear old Hall, and whether he had turned all topsy-turvy yet, in defiance of such old stagers as you and me and Arthur.' ' Not so bad as that,' said Caleb. ' The storm is only muttering in the distance,' said his mother. ' You are looking well, Agatha, I am glad to see.' ' I should be,' asserted Mrs Etheredge with cheer ful emphasis. ' I am always well when I am down here, and I shall enjoy my first country tea, on a real country lawn this summer, twice as much, be cause so many of my friends are good enough to give me the pleasure of their company. I know what you are going to ask, Have I left Etheredge well, and how are the children ? My husband is as hale and happy as ever among his piles of blue books, though the month is July and the temperature is 70 of an afternoon in the Park. He takes his ride as if it were April still ; I am not sure that he recognises the difference.

You will see how the children are grown, everyone of them, from Bertie, who promises to be a giant like Caleb there, to little Mary, who only a year ago was such a fairy of ten years that her father and I were afraid she would be kidnapped by Barnum or some other illustrious showman.' Agatha was as winning as ever. If anything she was lovelier in the tiny morsel of lace which pro fessed to be a matron's cap. It hardly concealed the dark silken hair, the waviness of which made the quantity appear double, while it did not contain a single grey thread. Now, Rachel's abundant hair was one mass of silver, beautiful in itself but lend ing a certain ashen effect to her colourless complexion. Woman of the world as Mrs Etheredge was, she refrained from introducing her young guest at once to her sister-in-law. Certainly, part of the reason was that they were not alone, and that there was already an element of discord in the company. Agatha did not refer only to the Langtons from the Hall when she spoke of the friends who were gracing her first afternoon tea at Ryelands. The table was already set under the finest old thorn tree far or near, on which the fragrant May snow was replaced by rich clusters of ruby haws, glitter ing among the dark leaves, brown at the tips under the shrivelling July sun. In the rustic chair to the left of the table sat Mrs Arthur from the Rectory,"], [130, "118 RACHEL LANGTON with one of her little step-daughters on the grass by her side. The presence of no fewer than three persons, all more or less neutral, was wanted to counteract a certain chill and pungency which crept into the air. The mellowing influence of Agatha Etheredge, great as it was on ordinary occasions, would not have been enough without the support, unconscious in one instance, of Caleb and the young lady visitor. Mrs Langton supplied the chill, Mrs Arthur fur nished the pungency, in the midst of the cere monious greeting of relatives who visited each other for the sake of appearance, while there was no love lost between them. Mrs Arthur called sharply to her step-daughter. The child, who had inherited her dead mother's clinging nature, had not for gotten her former friend, and had immediately sidled up to her. ' Don't tease, Laura ; you are leaning upon Mrs Langton. Can't you see you are treading on her dress ? ' ' The child is not teasing, and I don't mind my dress,' said Rachel, coldly. Whereupon Mrs Arthur scolded Laura afresh, found fault with the manner in which she shook hands with her cousin Caleb, told her that her Kate Greenaway bonnet was awry and her sash undone, and sent her away, with hanging head and spring ing tears, to find the young Etheredges, or a stray nursemaid. Mrs Langton bit her lips, and had"], [131, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 119 some excuse for thinking that Mrs Arthur was a hard step-mother, according to nursery tradition. On the contrary, she had put herself about con siderably to bring the persecuted maiden, in order that she might enjoy the treat of a half-holiday at Ryelands. Till the party from Langton Hall had appeared on the scene, Mrs Etheredge, who with all her kindness of heart had a fine sense of the proprieties, was under the impression that really Eleanor was bringing Laura too much forward, and was making too great a fuss with the child. Mrs Arthur in her cardinal-red gown and lace hat, with Malmaison carnations on the brim, looked a blaze of colour beside Agatha in her creamy draperies, Rachel \u2014 grey, even to her hair, and the strange girl in a white frock. Unfortunately, the blaze was not needed, for the Rector's wife was a high-coloured brunette to begin with, and she always flamed into a hot scarlet and a feverish restlessness before Mrs Langton's paleness and impassiveness. Mrs Arthur had been a little tired by her drive in the heat, and was disposed to lounge and gossip with Agatha over Arthur's doings \u2014 the state of his choir, the Bishop's last visit, and how many candidates had presented themselves for Confirmation. But in a moment all was changed. The Rector's wife was full of noisy chatter and excited gestures. She was de scribing the change of regiments at Westbridge, the new officers whose acquaintance she had made,"], [132, "120 RACHEL LANGTON the polo match they were arranging, and her own first essay, under the guidance of the fat old major, at trout-fishing, which she found so captivating that she did not believe she would be able to do anything else for the entire summer. Her hostess sought in her gentlest, most polite way to talk Mrs Arthur down. Caleb fidgeted and appeared uncomfortable. His mother sat in stony disapproval. The strange girl in white looked on with keen interest, taking in all the features of the scene. At last Mrs Arthur broke off her monologue and put down her cup. Her quick hazel eyes took in the thick belt of old shrubs enclosing the lawn like a green wall. She uttered an exclamation of delight and clapped her gloved hands. ' The very thing, Agatha, for an open-air play ! I have been dying to see one for an age, and you are not the person to disappoint me.' ' So it would,' cried Caleb, looking round him with sudden interest. ' Really a capital spot for the purpose.' 'Thank you for suggesting the idea,' said Agatha, nodding gaily. ' Ben would enjoy it above all things, when he takes a run down, for he has always been theatre mad, in the middle of his work.' She appeared as much infected with the appropriateness of the locality as were others. ' I wonder it did not occur to me before \u2014 but could it be managed ? I am afraid we are only too"], [133, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 121 tame and domestic. There is just one point, round by the copper beeches, where we could get out of sight of the house. What do you say, Essex?' turning with empressement to the girl visitor. The person appealed to made a more deliberate and critical survey of the lawn and its screen than the others had bestowed on them, and gave her verdict with unwonted decision for her years. She accepted the post of judge, with which she had been invested, without any affectation of doubt or hesitation, and spoke in a clear, full voice. ' The supposed woodland is too close on the stage \u2014 especially on what one may call the right wing. The space for the actors is scanty. But on the whole the place is not unsuited for the amateur open-air theatricals you are thinking of Mrs Arthur Langton clapped her hands again. ' Wasn't I right ? ' she demanded in high glee. ' Sha'n't we have a play ? I must beat up for recruits to take the parts, since I cannot act a bit. But I'll be dresser, prompter, anything else you wish.' ' What will the Rector say ? ' asked Agatha, jestingly. ' Oh ! I can answer for Arthur,' declared Mrs Arthur, defiantly. At this point in the conversation Rachel Langton got up, said she would see the Etheredge young people another day, and took her leave,"], [134, "122 RACHEL LANGTON Caleb rising reluctantly to accompany her. She submitted to be affectionately kissed by Mrs Etheredge, touched two fingers of the hand which Mrs Arthur extended with ostentatious careless ness, and bowed gravely to the young lady whom the hostess had addressed as ' Essex ' and had neglected to introduce to Mrs Langton and her son. To Rachel's surprise, and more or less to the surprise of all present, the girl bowed to curtseyed in return, one of those low curtseys which only survive as a homage to royalty. ' What does she mean ? ' Mrs Arthur was asking herself in her lively way. ' Is curtseying coming in again ? Is it a stage fashion ? ' Mrs Langton left the little company free to criticise her manners and character behind her back. Indeed as Agatha in her courtesy and friendliness, strolled with the Langtons to the other side of the house, where the phaeton and ponies were waiting, Mrs Arthur was still more at liberty to discuss the departed guest. ' Thank goodness ! that stick of a woman is gone and we can breathe freely once more,' she said, with emphasis, to her only auditor, whose acquaintance she had made for the first time that day. ' Oh ! dear no,' Mrs Arthur went on to explain, replying to an unspoken question in the girl's eyes, ' she is no relation of mine, I am happy to tell you, though she is a connection by marriage. She is sister-in-law to"], [135, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 123 Mrs Etheredge and my husband. There were more of the old family at the Hall, and one of them, Gerald, a shiftless fellow, thought fit to marry some poor dissenting minister's daughter.' (Mrs Arthur generally chose to speak of Mrs Langton's father as a dissenting minister, though she had been told many times that he was a clergy man of the Church of England, like her husband, if a little lower in rank than the Rector of Langton. When called to order for her inaccuracy she got off by protesting, ' Then, my dear, if he was not a dissenting minister he ought to have been one. I am sure his daughter has the very cut of dissent, and is a Methodist preacher on her own account.') At the present moment Mrs Arthur was finishing her explanation to an attentive listener. ' As ill luck would have it, Gerald was the second son and the eldest died unmarried, so that Gerald's widow \u2014 he died young also \u2014 and his son were brought to the Hall in old Mr Langton's lifetime, in order that the boy might be brought up in a manner becom ing the Squire's heir.

' Indeed,' said the girl, with so brief and reserved an ejaculation, that it seemed as if the marked attention with which she had at first listened to the story so that it had led Mrs Arthur on to still greater candour, was already on the wane. ' Of course, I don't mind mentioning such details,' resumed Mrs Arthur, with an approach to self defence in her tone, ' I am only a Langton by marriage, and Mrs Langton of the Hall is nothing to me. No doubt, Caleb is the head of the house, but we all like Caleb, and are sorry for him with such an uncomfortable mother.' ' Does she seek to rule him ? Is he very much under her influence ? ' asked the stranger with renewed interest. ' Not exactly,' said Mrs Arthur, hesitating a little. ' His uncle has had a good deal to do with his edu cation, which has been that of an ordinary young man of his rank. Besides, I believe, Caleb has too much character to be easily ruled by any woman. To do Mrs Langton justice,' went on her enemy with an evident effort, ' I don't think she seeks to rule him. She has too much faith in him and respect for him to do anything of the kind."], [137, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 125 Mind, I don't like her one bit,' asserted Mrs Arthur, with characteristic reckless frankness ; ' in fact, she is a bete noire of mine, but I cannot say that she wishes to make a cipher of her son.' ' I am glad to hear it,' exclaimed the girl, with an emphasis which caused Mrs Arthur to sit up and stare. ' It would so detract from her finer qualities and spoil the conception I have formed of her,' continued the speaker composedly. ' Mr Caleb Langton does not strike me as much out of the com mon ; but Mrs Langton interests me exceedingly.' ' You don't say so,' protested her listener with a gasp. 'You do astonish me, Miss Etheredge. That cold-blooded, narrow-minded, supercilious woman interesting ! ' ' I don't call her supercilious,' said Miss Ether edge, quietly, ' and what you regard as her cold bloodedness and narrow-mindedness seem to me the logical result of her antecedents. She is a lofty-souled, rigid old Puritan transplanted into the nineteenth century, a perfect specimen though an anachronism. I cannot tell what I would not have given to have had her to study from, when I was puzzling out the part of a Puritan heroine last winter. I don't mean that Mrs Langton is at all amiable and charming in the style of my cousin, Mrs Etheredge,' explained the young lady, ' but I am convinced,' with rising enthusiasm, ' there are splen did dramatic possibilities in your squire's mother.' ' It is fortunate you have discovered them,' said"], [138, "126 RACHEL LANGTON Mrs Arthur, drily, very much as if the possibilities had been left for Miss Etheredge to discover. Then she looked keenly at the girl in a vain attempt to make so strange a creature out. Miss Etheredge was tall and fair as Caleb Lang ton had described her without giving much con sideration to the subject. Her fairness was more a matter of detail than of generality. She was, in reality, brown-haired and brown-eyed, but the effect of fairness was given by what many people would have regarded as a defect. Her eyebrows and eyelashes were considerably lighter than her hair and eyes, so light as to approach the tint of flaxen. If they detracted from her beauty they fitted into the ivory whiteness of the regular featured face. They deprived it of some amount of shade and colouring, but they brought into stronger relief its perfection of form. The fore head, from which the brown hair was combed back and twisted in a coil on the top of the head, was conspicuously low, broad and full. The Grecian nose was delicate, with sensitive nostrils. The mouth, of which the curved lips were healthily red, was a trifle large, but the teeth within were beautiful. The chin was not square, as Caleb Langton's had been significantly enough from his childhood, it was slightly peaked, but any weakness in the shape was contradicted still more by the firm line of the jaw than by the intellectual char acter of the forehead."], [139, "AGATHA ETHEREDGE AND HER VISITOR 127 When Essex Etheredge looked up \u2014 looked the spectator in the face \u2014 her brown eyes were a re velation, they lent a peculiar depth and lustre of tone to the colourlessness of the face. The peaked chin grew full of piquancy and individuality, the broad brow was transformed into a crown of thought and feeling for the dark wells of passion in the eyes. Miss Etheredge's tall figure was still slender and spare for her twenty years, but it held the promise of developing into the magnificent proportions of the grandest type of womanhood."], [140, "128 CHAPTER II I NEW-FANGLED DOINGS ' I KNEW that actors and actresses moved freely in what is called the best society, but I was not aware that they were admitted into the intimacies of private life.' The speaker was Rachel Langton, and her tone was not only at its most freezing point, it was full of implied condemnation held in check with diffi culty. It held also a reserve of scarcely - con cealed annoyance. She was speaking to Agatha Etheredge, who had been dining at the Hall. The two ladies were sitting together in the oriel win dow. Agatha was in one of her exquisitely suitable matronly dinner-dresses. They were at once a little more costly and a little more elaborate than her maiden toilet had been in the old days of the delicate half mourning with the relief of the bright flowers at the throat. Rachel wore the iron rather than silver grey into which her widow's weeds had merged. The fine old room itself had been little modern ised or altered since the period of Agatha's sway there. Mrs Etheredge's young cousin had, as a necessary"], [141, "NEW-FANGLED DOINGS 129 obligation, been dining at the Hall also. She was at this moment being shown over the neighbouring conservatory by the young squire, who was doing his duty as showman with commendable alacrity and painstaking. ' My dear Rachel, the position of professional men and women of all kinds was never better than it is to-day,' said Agatha, with her usual gracious suavity. 'As for the stage, there is quite a revolution where it is concerned. It used to be the exception when men and women of any family to speak of adopted it as a calling, and these audacious persons were generally disowned by their kindred. But all that is changed. Nobody is ashamed now of hav ing a cousin or a niece on the boards.' As she spoke, Mrs Etheredge was looking affectionately at the objects around her, and re newing her familiarity with them. She broke off the discussion to exclaim with interest, \u2014 ' Can it be possible that over yonder are the very carved wooden flower-stands which I commissioned a young genius in the village to make for me, we shall not say how many years ago? I suppose poor Harry Morse has not turned out a Grinling Gibbons, else I should have been sure to hear of it ; but there are the flower-stands still \u2014 as a monu ment of his aspirations and mine.' ' Yes,' replied Rachel, in a matter-of-fact tone, ' I have no particular turn for flower-stands, that I should put away the old and replace them by the I"], [142, "130 RACHEL LANGTON new, very likely in less good taste than their pre decessors. Another thing, I happened to notice these very oak leaves the first time I was in this room. Harry Morse is a respectable house carpenter at Westbridge, which is about the best thing that could have happened to him. But we were speaking of the stage, of Miss Etheredge's being a professional actress ; you say the opinion of society has altered where the Theatre is con cerned. I was not thinking of it socially or in tellectually. I was brought up to regard the playhouse as one of the ante-chambers of Hell. Excuse my plain speaking,' as Agatha could not hide a recoil from the words, which were spoken without the slightest warmth. ' I shall be glad if you can tell me that there is not now the least warrant for what may sound such harsh censure, because the whole standard of acting and actors has been altered.' Agatha was silent for a second ; she was a truth ful little woman so far as she saw the truth. ' Well, you know, manners have improved, there can be no doubt of that,' she said with conviction. ' To go back to the time of Shakespeare himself, when the drama was in its cradle, there was a primi tive coarseness, I will say grossness, of expression which could never be suffered in this generation.' ' And what of morals ? ' persisted Mrs Langton. ' Oh ! morals are immensely improved also, I make no question,' said Mrs Etheredge, cheerfully."], [143, "NEW-FANGLED DOINGS 131 ' But, of course, the improvement there must be more gradual, and is internal, so is less observable. You must remember, Rachel, dear, that actors and actresses are not preachers \u2014 outright. They play to mixed audiences and must not fly over, not only the heads, but also the hearts and consciences of their audiences. Still, the theatre is a national school as well as a mirror of contemporary thought and action,' proceeded Agatha, looking super humanly wise as she always did when she quoted Etheredge. ' My husband holds that it is a tre mendous mistake to neglect or despise the theatre. I wish you heard Essex speak of the impressions she seeks to convey, the great universal lessons of tender, passionate human nature and divine art she desires to teach. She says that the stage must appeal to popular sympathies, and she admits that it has always been more or less tempted to content itself with merely exciting or amusing, rather than elevating its public. She thinks also that the long-established habit of borrowing our stage plays from French sources has been a positive misfortune both to the performers and the public. For all that she has high views for the stage.' ' I have no doubt Miss Etheredge is in earnest, as one might expect from a young, enthusiastic girl, but there are infinitely more important lessons than those of the stage to be learnt,' said Mrs Langton, with her sombre dogmatism. ' Human nature and art \u2014 the last is generally more human"], [144, "132 RACHEL LANGTON than divine \u2014 are for time ; there are other lessons \u2014 the only ones really worth learning, which are for eternity.' ' Nobody denies that,' said Agatha, gently, ' and the two lessons need not clash in the least. Arthur does not disapprove of the theatre on the whole. The worthy representatives of the very clergymen who were strongly opposed to it a generation ago, have withdrawn their opposition and are disposed to lend it their countenance. They don't like some of the French plays, certainly, though we must all acknowledge that French acting is perfection.' ' Clergymen are much the same as other men in being carried away by a strong current of public opinion. Arthur is like the rest though he means well. Don't think I underrate Arthur.' Rachel pulled herself up hastily. ' I have long known how good he is at heart, how loyally, in his own way, he seeks to serve his Master. We are not always agreed, but don't suppose that I have for gotten what a Pharisee of the Pharisees I was when I came here first. How I sat in judgment and could see no good in any of you \u2014 my dead hus band's kindred, or in the creed you professed.' ' Dear Rachel,' said Agatha, soothingly and car essingly, ' I am sure you have made it all up to us since then. How could you understand us, or we you, brought up as we were so differently ? But I always thought you would do Arthur justice in time. My own old boy ! How glad I should be"], [145, "NEW-FANGLED DOINGS 133 to think Charlie and Bertie would turn out as well as Arthur has done. He was such a brave, un complaining little fellow when we lost our mother, and he had to fight down his sorrow and loneliness at his public school. Why ! I declare, there is the drawer which I had put in that cabinet for his col lection of butterflies, to encourage him in his taste for natural history. I believe the remains of his butterflies will be found in it' ' No, you are wrong there,' said Rachel, with a ittle smile. ' Arthur routed them out himself when he and Caleb were getting up a museum as a de sirable appendage to the Rector's school' There was a pause in the conversation, while Rachel said to herself regretfully, ' I hope she does not guess that I have been dreadfully disappointed in Arthur, with all his good qualities.' Agatha, on her side, was telling herself, with a shade of reproach in her thoughts, ' I know she has been disappointed in Arthur. But in whom would poor, dear Rachel not be disappointed eventually? Her whole standard and opinions are far too highly pitched for ordinary mortals. She lives in a world of her own, with laws of its own. She is a good mother, too. I wonder how so good a woman can cherish such an aversion to Eleanor, admitted that she is altogether different from dear, sainted Maude, of whom Rachel was fond, I believe. Still, Eleanor is such a frank, honest soul, with such exuberant life in her"], [146, "134 RACHEL LANGTON that it is positively refreshing to come in contact with her. I am persuaded she is, at bottom, sin cerely attached to Arthur and his children, and far kinder to the children than Rachel gives her credit for.' And Agatha was nearer the truth in her optimism than Rachel was in her pessimism. ' I would not give this dear old drawing-room for all the \u00e6sthetic drawing-rooms in the world,' Agatha began again parenthetically ; ' not that I don't go in a little for \u00e6stheticism on my own account, as you may observe on the rare occasions when you favour us with your company in town. Now, if Caleb had been a girl instead of the dear fellow he is, we should have seen more of you. You must have brought out your daughter, had her presented, and given her at least one season to let her see a little of the great world.' ' I don't know that I should,' said Rachel. ' But she would have had to live in the world,' remonstrated Agatha, opening mildly protesting eyes, ' and ignorance is not innocence, is it ? I don't wish to beg any questions you care to ask,' returning suddenly to a former topic. ' I can guess you think the stage a highly improper and unde sirable profession, to say the least of it, for my dear young friend and kinswoman Essex, not only because she is Ben's cousin, but also because she is a beautiful and charming young girl. However, you will grant, in common fairness \u2014 you are fair,"], [147, "NEW-FANGLED DOINGS 135 dear \u2014 that there is not the same objection there once was. I need not draw your attention to the many delightful, unexceptionable people \u2014 Kendals, Bancrofts and so forth \u2014 who are actors and actresses whom one meets everywhere nowadays. They are as excellent as they are well-bred and entertaining. I imagine you don't know much about them, as you prefer to live so much out of the world, but that is not their fault I was not going to remind you of what dear, good Bishop Fraser, who must have been, I am sure, a bishop after your own heart, said. He declared one of the best girls he knew, and one of the most devout members of his church, was a ballet girl. What I did wish to say was that even in bad times for the stage there were good women who were actresses and yet incurred no degradation by the association. The breath of scandal never touched Mrs Siddons ; Mrs Inchbald was respected by all who knew her.' ' I have no call to interfere, but I have always understood,' said Rachel, gravely, ' that the career of an actress is about the most exposed and dan gerous career which an unprotected young girl can follow. I say nothing of the injury to her delicacy, her modesty, her Christian integrity, in perform ing night after night, before a multitude, in order to interpret to them what you admit is their not too refined estimate of life, and to lay bare for their benefit her reading of the follies, passions and tragedies which convulse society.'"], [148, "136 RACHEL LANGTON ' But Essex is not unprotected.' Mrs Etheredge caught quickly at the first objection. ' She has the acknowledged support of her family and friends, and of not merely the fashionable world, but of many \u2014 I must say \u2014 of the most liberal and charit able-minded of the public. As to interpreting our deepest feelings for us, poor stupid souls that we are ! she would do that quite as much if she wrote a popular poem or novel. She would put herself into it spiritually if she had not to appear before her public personally. I confess that I cannot see the great difference. I think also that, if a girl is placed in a position of some difficulty and danger, and so behaves as to cover herself and all con nected with her with credit, nay, with distinction, it is more honour to her than if she had never been tried.' Rachel thought that for a girl to put herself in such a position was a good deal as if she were proposing to cast herself from a pinnacle of the temple, expecting the angels of God to bear her up. But she said nothing, and Mrs Etheredge pursued the persuasive tenor of her discourse. ' We are all so proud of dear Essex and of what we consider her assured success. Her branch of the Etheredges is very poor, and after her father died, when she was little more than a child, she showed a noble spirit of independence in deter mining to work for herself.' Rachel could not help turning over in her mind"], [149, "NEW-FANGLED DOINGS 137 how little of the noble spirit of independence the Langtons had seen in her when they considered a poor clergyman's daughter who drudged as a teacher a totally unfit wife for the shiftless younger son of a squire. Could the doggedly faithful pro secution of work be viewed as the vindication of a noble spirit of independence only when there was no thought of virtue being its own reward ? Must the prolonged effort be something out of the dull, beaten track, something that might end by bring ing such fame and affluence as even an actress, who commands but a section of public favour, wins in the present day more unfailingly than the most eminent author dares claim the loaves and fishes of literature? Still, Mrs Langton said nothing. These reflections were due, doubtless, to the linger ing prejudices of the lower sphere from which she had sprung. ' Essex chose the stage for her profession,' Mrs Etheredge went on with her tale. ' She was not above sixteen years of age then. She has been studying closely under the best teachers for four years. (It was with the greatest difficulty that I could induce her to come down here with me and take a little holiday.) She has played with a com pany in the provinces, and she has had a minor engagement in one of our London theatres ; but it is only when she has been called upon to replace a more experienced actress, laid aside for the time> that she has been able to show what is in her. It"], [150, "138 RACHEL LANGTON is there without doubt, and her day is coming ; we are all looking forward to it confidently.' Mrs Langton refrained, as before, from making a remark. ' There is something else I should like to say to you, dear,' Agatha began again, in her most win ning way. ' It is quite right and natural that you should think first of Caleb, and reason whether it is prudent to bring a young man like him in fre quent contact with so attractive a girl as Essex. I don't blame you in the least ! I should have done the same where my Bertie is concerned, were he grown up. But I am dear Caleb's aunt, if I am not his mother, and I may venture to say that I have as warm a regard for my nephew, my father's representative, and have his interests as much at heart as if he were a boy of my own. I quite agree with you, Rachel, that the connection would not be desirable for Caleb, though Essex is a dear, good girl \u2014 as good as she is gifted, as unworldly as you are, a delightful companion, and very likely to be famous one day. We shall all be prouder still of Essex. I can tell you, in the unimportant, trifling parts she has filled, she has already received the discriminating approbation of the select few, as well as the enthusiastic praise of the unthinking many. But, if she should ever marry, she must fly higher than Caleb. The Squire of Langton Hall is an ex cellent parti ; but he is not high enough in rank to defy old-world scruples and pronounced prejudices."], [151, "NEW-FANGLED DOINGS 139 He would have to live down a great deal of unrea soning county opposition. He would not be able to save his wife from it, and I can tell you it is very disagreeable when it is provoked. No, Essex must not look lower than a millionaire or a peer \u2014 not in reduced circumstances. When some earl or mar quis, who owns a large slice of his county and is an irresponsible authority to himself and all around him, comes forward, then she may think of mar riage \u2014 not before. We all know an actress was a Countess of Derby, and a singer was a Countess of Essex, and they were not solitary instances of such promotion. I will tell you as a great secret, for Essex would die rather than whisper such a thing \u2014 she has already, to my knowledge, had the eldest son of a viscount at her feet. But I am con vinced the idea of marriage has not entered into her head up to the present moment. She is ab solutely devoted to her profession. You may set your mind at rest, and, if you will just mention to Caleb what I have said to you \u2014 forewarned is fore armed \u2014 he is perfectly safe on all counts.' Sympathetic as Agatha Etheredge was, she had no conception of the impression she was producing, though Rachel had drawn herself up and back at the first reference to her son. ' I never fully understood before,' said Mrs Lang ton, with a gasp, 'how entirely different is the medium through which we see things. You have the best intentions, I know, Agatha, but it strikes"], [152, "140 RACHEL LANGTON me that it is disparaging, almost insulting, both to Caleb and the young lady, your friend, to allude to them in this manner. As for choosing for himself in the most momentous step of his life, or taking care of himself in anticipation of his choice, I leave all that to him \u2014 he is of age,' said Rachel, almost in the language of Scripture. ' You may speak to him yourself, and caution him, if you care to do so, though I'm afraid he will resent it even from you, for it is certainly his own affair.' Agatha shook her head gently. How could it be his own affair when he was Squire of Langton Hall and the head of the house ? But there were points on which his mother was so obtuse that there was no use in arguing with her. At the same time, Mrs Etheredge looked at her sister-in-law with a kind of affectionate admiration. ' You are the old woman, Rachel, and I cannot help loving you for it, though I could not do it. But in this case, fortunately, there is not the slightest risk in leaving events to take their course. Oh ! here come the truants Caleb and Essex. Have you seen the agapanthus plants, Essex ? We were al ways great in agapanthus plants at Langton, they did their duty so faithfully in flowering at the proper season. Are they as much to be depended upon as they used to be ? Next to the agapanthus tubs our piece de resistance was the old wistaria on Burridge's lodge, but of course you did not go there. Oh ! Essex, I must tell you about the Bur-"], [153, "NEW-FANGLED DOINGS 141 ridges. We were always nearly as proud of them as of this lovely oriel window and the yew tree walk. We were accustomed to say that there had been Burridges in the Park Lodge as long as there had been Langtons in the Hall. That was non sense, I need not say ; but the Burridges have served us, father and son, for a century and a half, at least. As nobody has old retainers in this de generate age, they are feathers in our cap to be puffed and bragged about when we can find the op portunity. How are Mark Burridge and his old woman, Caleb ? I must go and see them soon.'"], [154, "142 CHAPTER IV RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH IN ESSEX ETHEREDGE When it was known that there was a rising young actress of Mr Etheredge's family staying with Agatha Etheredge, she was at once accepted as the lionne and belle of the summer in the neigh bourhood of Ryelands and Langton Hall, whatever might be the depth of county prejudices against matrimonial alliances with actresses. Mrs Arthur Langton was to have the novel experience on which she had set her heart. There was to be a lawn play at Ryelands, to which all the friends of the families of Langton and Ether edge were invited. There was also to be a dramatic recital in the parish schoolroom for the benefit of the parish at large. Miss Etheredge had consented to give her services here also in a per formance confined to herself. Mrs Etheredge had not found it in her heart to disappoint a great many people, young people especially, because of an antediluvian scruple of dear Rachel's. Agatha would have much preferred"], [155, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH 143 to please everybody, like the old man with the bundle of sticks, but when that delectable end could not be attained, the next thing was to please the greatest number of candidates for pleasure. The whole young people within driving distance were rejoicing over the lawn play. There had been nothing of the kind at their garden-parties till dear Mrs Etheredge introduced the delightful innovation. It was such a welcome variety on toujours perdrix \u2014 always lawn-tennis. For those who had not the glory of acting in the play, there was the gratification of watching and praising or blaming their friends and neighbours who were more gifted, or less shy, or who had been applied to sooner, before all the nice parts were taken up. The performance of the play coincided with one of the occasions when Mr Etheredge was able to run down to Ryelands for a few days. He was far beyond acting on his own account, but he had the taste for the theatre which had culminated among the Etheredges in Essex Etheredge's appearance on the stage. He said that nothing refreshed him more after his work than a play, even an amateur play. He was as amiable as his wife was in making every allowance for the per formers. His interest in the progress of his cousin Essex was sufficient to cause him to overlook any amount of disadvantages, and to welcome an opportunity of testing the girl's powers by his own observation."], [156, "144 RACHEL LANGTON Agatha asserted pleasantly that she really' could not help giving the play ; if she had not given it, then it would have given itself, in spite of her, there was such general satisfaction bound up with its coming to pass, and Ben was as keen about it as anyone. She could not fail Ben when he had set his heart on seeing how Essex was getting on. He would have brought down foot lights and an orchestra from town if they had been required. But footlights were not wanted on the edge of a lawn on a summer afternoon, and the birds, if they would but consent to sing so late in the season, would form the most charming and appropriate of orchestras. The Rector was carried away by the zeal and exultation of his wife. In spite of her assertion to the contrary, it was found, to her unbounded de light, that she was capable of acting respectably in strictly subordinate parts. Arthur arrived at the conclusion that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander. If there was no harm in the upper ten thousand of the neighbourhood witness ing the play at Ryelands, why should not his humbler parishioners be entertained and amused by the pale reflection of a similar performance in the schoolroom ? They had not many sources of diversion \u2014 these heavy, hard - worked, careworn men and women, these hardly-brought-up, poverty pinched, adversity -buffeted children. Penny read ings had gone out of fashion, but these simple folk,"], [157, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH 145 for the most part, would appreciate being treated to a taste of the dish which had just been presented, with greater elaboration, to their social betters. And Arthur thought also that it was high time Mrs Langton at the Hall \u2014 he had not called her his sister Rachel lately \u2014 should be taught that there were more lights than one in which life ought to be viewed. It was idle to pretend that there could be constant deference to her opinion. The pity was \u2014 and the Rector acknowledged it was a pity \u2014 that Caleb had entered heart and soul into the play of which his mother disapproved. In fact she refused to be present, though her absence would be a marked indication of her feel ings and would excite talk and speculation \u2014 a climax which he, for one, would very much regret. Caleb had an unquestionable capacity for acting, and as great a relish for it as any Etheredge of them all displayed. The lad had not only been in the university's dramatic society, he had been chosen, though Greek was not his strong point, to act in the Greek play by which his college ex emplified its erudition and justified its existence to the world. When it came to plain proofs of histrionic ability, though there were sufficient bridling or giggling damsels and blustering fellows to pass muster as supernumeraries in the play at Ryelands, there were only two persons who had the slightest claim to be players. There was Essex Etheredge, a long way ahead of all the K"], [158, "146 RACHEL LANGTON others, as might well be, seeing that she was a pro fessional player ; and a long way behind her, but still far in advance of his non-professional com panions, was Caleb Langton. He could use his arms and legs and manage his voice without look ing like a convicted fool ; on the contrary, he bore some resemblance to the person he aspired to be for the time. In the circumstances, perhaps it could not be expected that an independent, master ful young man should hide his talents under a bushel, and fail his Aunt Agatha, in order to humour a crotchet of his mother's. The performance was made as easy as possible to the performers. Miss Etheredge had negatived at once every outrageous attempt at curtailed scenes from ' As you Like It,' or ' Midsummer's Night Dream,' or even ' St Ronan's Well,' the only appropriate examples of open-air plays which had occurred to everybody. She had put down her determined little foot with equal firmness on all romantic stock pieces with which some of the amateurs had a bowing acquaintance. These makeshifts, she explained, depended chiefly on striking scenery and picturesque costumes. The first was conspicuous by its absence, the second would be difficult to procure, and still more difficult to act up to. She ordained that the play, for which there could only be a week or two's preparation, should be one requiring little or no making up for the characters. It should be a little modern drawing-"], [159, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH 147 room piece. A party of artists \u2014 ladies and gentlemen \u2014 would be together on a sketching expedition in the New Forest. They would gossip, quarrel, come to grief and get out of it again in a half-humorous, half-pathetic way. It was to be just a little bit of genteel comedy, a com monplace story which might happen to people in real life. It was therefore fitted for a drawing-room or a lawn representation. Yet nobody except these two, Essex Etheredge and Caleb Lang ton, could succeed in giving it any life to speak of. Essex Etheredge, it might be supposed, was willing to oblige her host and hostess, and to favour the Rector. The fact remained that she was still a young enough actress, sufficiently enamoured of her profession to enjoy every fresh chance of practising it. The charm was added that here was a situation which could not often arise, when she was stage manager as well as first lady, had the choice of the play, and could arrange each detail. Her materials were not great ; they were decidedly raw, but nobody could dispute her right, as their sole moulder, to the chief credit in case of success, and the lion's share of censure if there was a failure. Essex did not shrink from the responsibility. She was furiously busy training her band of re cruits, her awkward squad, for the first couple of weeks after the play was fixed upon. During this"], [160, "148 RACHEL LANGTON time Caleb Langton almost lived at Ryelands and was her most efficient ally. But it did not look, on the face of things, as if Miss Etheredge was overwhelmed with work and care, when, in the course of one of her solitary walks, snatched from her numerous avocations, she turned her steps, only two days before the great Saturday of the play, to Langton Hall. The distance was three miles and a half, yet she walked the whole way, for no apparent purpose save to make a call of ceremony on Mrs Langton. The mistress of the house was at home (the young squire was away as had been usual lately). Mrs Langton hastened to receive her visitor, under the impression that she had come on some mission from Mrs Etheredge. The relations be tween Rachel and the Etheredges, which had been pleasant ones for many a day, were almost as much strained at this moment as were her relations with the Rectory. It seemed as if, after all these years, she could not live in harmony with Caleb's father's people, and the thought hurt her. She had not announced her intention of not being present at the play at Ryelands, but the intention was taken for granted. And she was such a woman, so capable of inspiring a kind of awe in her friends and acquaintances, that nobody pressed her to reconsider her resolution. Her son had not even asked her what she was going to do. He knew that she had uniformly declined to come to Oxford"], [161, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH I49 to hear him spout either in English or in Greek. He was too like his mother to bandy words with her on a subject on which they were at variance, while he was convinced that neither would be able to shake the determination of the other. In a few minutes Mrs Langton was satisfied that Miss Etheredge had spared the time to come over to the Hall on her own account,with no prompt- ing from Agatha. Why had she taken all that trouble when she was very much occupied ? Rachel asked herself in perplexity. The next moment her hospitable instincts prevailed. ' Have you walked all the way ? ' she inquired, with concern in her voice. ' You must be very tired. I used to be a good walker when I was young, but few girls nowadays, especially few town - bred girls \u2014 I understand you are town-bred, Miss Etheredge \u2014 are ready to undertake a walk of seven miles for a piece of etiquette. Excuse me, I am not a very mannerly woman myself, so I am apt to over- look these small points of courtesy. But I am glad to see you, certainly. As you must be tired I shall ring for tea, and you will let me drive you part of the way home. ' My sister-in-law will never forgive me,' she added, with the half smile which lent a subdued sunshine to the grave face, ' if I suffer you to over-exert yourself, so that there may be any danger of your breaking down at this time.'"], [162, "RACHEL LANGTON 150 ' I shall not break down, thanks, Mrs Langton,' answered Essex, quietly. ' I am not very tired. I like walking and I am a good walker. We do not live near the theatre, but I always walk to rehearsal by preference. I have plenty of work to do,' she finished, with a quick, involuntary flash of her wonderful brown eyes, and a laugh, partly self assertive, partly wistful. There was a short silence, which allowed the perfect stillness of the great house to be felt. Possibly it was the only house of its standing in the parish, the unruffled quiet of which was entirely undisturbed by the small excitement and turmoil in connection with the play at Ryelands. Yet, after all, the profound peace was only superficial, for in the back settlements and lower regions there was a low thunder of rebellious grumbling. The young master, who was popular in his own domain, was going to act with the other gentry in a mock play. Whether he was to borrow a cavalry helmet or a bob-wig from the old rubbish in the long gallery, or whether he was to appear in tights and paint like ' Mr Merriman ' at the circus, nobody could tell. The cruel contradiction was that after he conde scended to forget himself so far, in good company, nobody, not even madam, his mother, was to have the benefit of the performance, and to encourage it, as in duty bound, by their marked applause. But the murmur of discontent did not reach the fine old drawing-room where Mrs Langton and"], [163, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH 151 Miss Etheredge sat and looked at each other, as if they did not know what to say next. Yet neither of the women was shy, and one was well versed for her years in the small change of society. Sitting thus, a casual observer might have re marked a certain likeness between the two women, not altogether different from what often exists be tween mother and daughter. It would have been more conspicuous before Rachel Langton's hair had changed from brown to silver. They were both tall women, and both had the same clear paleness of complexion which may exist along with sound health. In both, the eyes \u2014 grey in the one, and brown in the other \u2014 were much darker than the fairness of the skin warranted. There the actaul resemblance ended, for the face of the one was the sensitive, mobile face of the artist. The face of the other was set in lines of deliberate matter-of-factness and sternness rather than hardness. The elder woman's face was that of one who had become early familiar with the darker realities of life, had accepted them, and had grown impatient of all make-believes. It was the face of a woman who had fought grim poverty in her youth, fought the irreparable loss of her chief earthly good in her early womanhood, and fought the necessity of accommodating herself to surroundings, uncongenial alike to her nurture and nature, during the remainder of her life. But, differing in many respects as the women did, there"], [164, "152 RACHEL LANGTON was in both faces an unusual element of strength \u2014 in the younger, that of inexhaustible elasticity ; in the elder, that of steadfast endurance. ' You suggested that I had undertaken a walk of six or seven miles for a piece of etiquette \u2014 I sup pose because I dined here in company with Mrs Etheredge, and it was proper that I should call on you afterwards,' began Essex, as calmly as if she were discussing the motives of some other person. ' Pardon me, it is not so. I have a special reason of my own for walking over.' ' Indeed ! ' exclaimed Rachel, taken aback. ' To what then am I to attribute the \u2014 ' ' Oh ! don't say honour or favour,' her visitor interrupted her quickly ; ' they are such conven tional words, and you are not a conventional woman. You are far too honest not to be above conventionality.' ' I am obliged by your good opinion,' Rachel began again, mystified, and, to tell the truth, a trifle offended. She did not object to be called uncon ventional, but she hated to be styled odd or eccen tric, particularly when the definition took the form of an uncalled-for compliment. ' Now you are angry,' said the girl, reading her companion's face as if it had been a book, and making no concealment of what she read. ' But you must hear what I have walked over to say. They tell me you are not coming to see the play on Saturday. Before I ask you if that is true, and"], [165, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH 153 why you are not coming, I wish to say that if I had known \u2014 though perhaps I might have guessed, that you are opposed on principle to plays and play-acting, I should have had nothing to do with them in this instance. I should have refused to take a part or to give any advice in the matter, and the whole thing must have fallen to the ground.' ' Allow me to speak, Miss Etheredge,' said Rachel, stiffly. ' What you are saying sounds to me quite overstrained and rather ridiculous. I have my own opinions, but I have no right, no wish to thrust them on other people so as to overthrow their plans. You are with your friends and relatives ; you are acting at their request to oblige them. I should not have agreed to raise a dissenting voice, even if you had come far out of your way to consult me.' ' Your son, Mr Caleb Langton, is one of the principal actors in the play. I should not have permitted that, I should have refused to act with him, if I had known it was against your wish,' said Essex, with tranquil firmness. ' It strikes me that you are making a mountain out of a molehill,' said Rachel, with her gruff snap pishness, colouring faintly as she spoke. ' My son has acted before now, and I daresay will act again. He is his own master, he is entitled to judge for himself. I should not thank anyone for being so foolish as to forbid his doing what he sees fit to do, simply because I cannot approve of it'"], [166, "154 RACHEL LANGTON ' But I should have forbidden him if I had known,' said Essex, very decidedly. She did not speak arrogantly, still it was somewhat in the tone of one who had been led to believe her judgment trustworthy and her sentences incontrovertible. ' It might have been different if it had been done elsewhere,' she went on to say, thoughtfully ; 'but here, under your very eye, compelling you to show to all the people he and you know best, that your son and you are not of the same mind, and that you disapprove of his behaviour, I call it bad taste, bad form altogether.' ' His Aunt Agatha should have seen to that,' Rachel Langton was drawn in to protest with some vehemence. ' She has always been the authority on matters of taste and propriety in the family. She may not have foreseen all the con sequences of this gala of hers, or she may have grown more careless of appearances in her prosperity than she used to be. I, myself, put little value on appearances.' ' I should think not,' said Miss Etheredge, medi tatively. ' You are too straightforward and righteous. You live your religion, and are suffi ciently above worldly standards not to lay them to heart. Having said this, it may sound like self praise for me to declare that I don't care much for appearances either, but I don't Some of my friends say that it is a dangerous peculiarity \u2014 above all, for a girl in my profession ; but if we"], [167, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH 155 care for the reality, why need we be always think ing of the shadow ? I don't think it can be dangerous \u2014 do you ? ' Without waiting for Mrs Langton's answer, she continued earnestly, \u2014 ' But such personal indifference makes one better qualified to pronounce on a matter of taste where other people are concerned. Now, I may be mistaken, but I do think it is wrong for you and your son to be forced into a corner and compelled to let your world \u2014 your particular world \u2014 see that you differ in opinion.' ' I don't suppose that it signifies much,' said Rachel, drily. ' My conscience may be troubling me,' persisted Essex, 'since, if I had not been here, this play would not have been thought of, and if I had reflected in time I could have put a stop to it. You see, madam ' (she used the old-fashioned mode of address quite simply and naturally, like one accustomed to all forms of speech in her daily and nightly experience), ' stage players are sometimes afflicted with consciences after the fashion of more unblemished, unrebukable people.' 'I never doubted it,' said Mrs Langton, with a spark of indignation. ' You do not think me so horribly uncharitable as that comes to ? ' ' I do not know what to think,' said Essex, leaning back in her chair and looking Rachel steadily in the face. ' Were you ever in a theatre ?"], [168, "156 RACHEL LANGTON Did you ever witness the representation of a stage play ? ' ' Never ! ' answered Mrs Langton. ' Then how can a woman like you condemn us \u2014 your own son among the rest, unseen, unheard ? ' demanded the girl, not so much angrily as sorrow fully. ' I should not have expected it from you. I have imagined you so honourable in the best sense, so upright. Unbending? Yes, perhaps, but incapable of unfairness. You are not asked to enter a theatre, which thinkers of your class vow, even in this nineteenth century, not to approach within miles and miles, unless, indeed, it is trans formed from its original use into a preaching station, or into the centre of a charity organisation. You have simply been invited to attend a gather ing of your friends and neighbours (your Rector among them), in the broad daylight of a summer afternoon on your sister-in-law's lawn, where you can sit and quietly make up your mind whether or not we actors, professional and amateur, are guilty of unpardonable iniquity.' ' I am not sure that I am invited,' blurted out Rachel, with a slightly abashed laugh, for she had a new, uncomfortable sense of feeling a little ashamed of herself. ' I think your cousins have been frightened to compromise me and themselves by a direct invitation, which would have implied a direct refusal. But I will come on your invi-"], [169, "RACHEL LANGTON MEETS HER MATCH 157 tation, for you are right. I ought not to condemn any practice on hearsay evidence.' ' I knew you would say so when I put it to you,' said Essex, with a proud, pleased air, as she rose to her feet and mechanically disposed of her drapery. ' I believed you would come if I asked you as I have done. You and people like you are all that are left of the grand old English Puritans. You will not think me very conceited if I say that I spent so much time last winter analysing the type, that I did not think I could be mistaken in my conception of the individual.' Thus there was a truce established between Rachel Langton and Essex Etheredge, such a truce as could not have existed had not the two women been what they were \u2014 transcendental, en thusiastic each in her sphere."], [170, "158 CHAPTER V THE RYELANDS' PLAY AND THE SCHOOLROOM RECITAL Many a mature and youthful mind, within a cer tain radius of Ryelands, was deeply exercised over the prospect of the weather for the great Play- Saturday ; so much depended on the weather. The play, even with Miss Etheredge to carry it off, would be shorn of half its glory if it had to be played in the drawing-room, like any trumpery children's charade, instead of being an open-air idyl. There had been a rainy day within the week, and a shower the morning before, but the clouds cleared off splendidly. It was ' set fair ' by the barometer on that 16th of August, with a snowy fleece tempering the light blue of the sky, in which there hung the golden mist that indicated no small amount of heat But it only afforded a sufficient reason for the welcome awning erected over the imposing semi-circle of seats rising in orthodox tiers before the house. The awning and the seats served the desirable purpose of throwing the house"], [171, "THE RYELANDS' PLAY 159 into the background and hiding it as much as possible from view, while the lawn with its crescent of shrubbery was kept free for the actors' entrances and exits. Mrs Langton came early, not desiring to create a sensation by her arrival. She certainly could not complain of her reception. Agatha was highly flattered and affectionately cordial. The Rector was also pleased, and found a place for Rachel next himself. Mr Etheredge roused himself from the pleasant languor of a man who has done his work and is entitled to enjoy himself, to conduct her to her seat. Even Mrs Arthur could afford to be civil in mischievous anticipation of the shock she would give Mrs Langton when that austere per sonage found that her clergywoman was one of the performers. From Essex Etheredge Rachel had a bright look and a grateful bow full of respect and friendli ness, just as the girl was vanishing from the general company, whom she had been helping to welcome and seat in their proper places, to emerge presently on the sylvan stage. As for Caleb, he came and stood for a moment with his hand on the back of his mother's chair, saying, in a hearty undertone, ' That's right, mother, we are proud of your patronage. I trust you are comfortable, and I hope you will be amused.' If Rachel had been Agatha, she would have been amply rewarded for her concession. She had cer-"], [172, "160 RACHEL LANGTON tainly gratified a number of people whom she cared to gratify. It could not be denied that the orchestra was somewhat of a failure. The birds that had been expected to supply solos and accompaniments did not fulfil the too sanguine expectations entertained of them. Birds, as a rule, do not sing in August ; an occasional chirp and a rarer trill were all that could be got from them. True, there were country sounds in the background, the rattle and Jingle of a mowing machine in operation a field or two off, the occasional rumble of a cart on the highroad, and from the adjoining meadow the disconsolate bleating of a score of sheep whose lambs had just been appropriated by a couple of butchers. But though Mrs Etheredge maintained these sounds were delightfully appropriate and suggestive, and only wanted the whistling of a ploughboy to make them complete, they were sounds of the fields and not of the woods. Besides, nobody listened to them. After all, nobody does listen much to a real orchestra ; it is only an excuse for chatter, which is quite ready to break forth without an excuse. Costumes, or rather the lack of them, formed the second drawback. A large proportion of the ladies among the audience, and naturally ladies were in the majority, kept regretting the absence of such bewitching, sumptuous stage costumes as the mur murers saw, occasionally, were accustomed to read about in the society papers. A modern play with-"], [173, "THE RYELANDS' PLAY 161 out costumes was a little like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. Could not Miss Etheredge have borrowed some ravishing dresses, in the height of the last fashion, from her theatre ? It might be very convenient for the present actors to go through the whole of the acts with nothing more troublesome to put on and off than artists' blouses, varied by ordinary walking dresses, but the players' gain was a loss to the spectators. It was a comfort to learn that these were the principal, if not the sole, hitches. For the detection of Alice Brereton tittering out of season, and Fred Lacey not remembering his cue, and, in his con sternation, unable to keep his ' berry ' from slipping off the side of his head, were only titillating inter ludes in the main business. The entrance of the strolling artists \u2014 a cosmopolitan company, English, American and French \u2014 the erection of their easels and white umbrellas, the tricks of the studios, the national idiosyncrasies, the little well-contrived laughable accidents, were all watched and listened to with lively interest and appreciation. So were the few striking incidents \u2014 the rivalry, the split in the camp, the base misrepresentation by its traitor, which threatened to sever a bond with a still stronger and sweeter foundation than that of art The sympathies of all present went, as they were bound to go, with the frank, courageous girl who confronted a lie which was only half a lie, and therefore harder to fight down. She confessed a L"], [174, "162 RACHEL LANGTON simple folly on her part. She admitted a family burden of disgrace, borne until then in decent silence. Thus she cleared herself and vindicated her lover from the momentary doubt which had ob scured but not extinguished his honest constancy. Where were the deadly harm and the radical unwholesomeness in the open-air life of the story ? Rachel Langton, an attentive auditor, could not discover them. Caleb, who was acting so well the manly but human lover, did not look a fantastic mountebank in such a velvet coat as he might have worn any day. And Essex Etheredge was not acting at all. She was living that other girl's life. She was enjoying the girlish gladness of its half holiday expectation. She was experiencing the womanly heroism which bore so dauntlessly and unflinchingly the secret load that marked her out from her companions, and at any moment might crush her. She was sharing in the fine perception of what was due to herself and her lover, the faith in God and in man which helped her to recognise that the moment had come when she must tell the truth, the whole truth, and let who would bear the consequence. All the time Essex did not look other than she might have looked if she had hap pened to be a girl painter, instead of a girl actress, engaged on a painting tour. It did not need Mrs Etheredge to assure everybody that her cousin could have supplied from her brush, if necessary, choice bits of scenery to bring the drawing-room"], [175, "THE RYELANDS' PLAY 163 in touch with the play, supposing the weather had changed and it had been impossible to have the acting on the lawn. Mrs Langton, in her ignorance, was not without a perception that this naturalness in the character had to do with the girl's faculty as a player, so that if she had appeared in the strange habiliments of a Greek slave, or in the royal robes of a medi\u00e6val queen, she would have been equally at home in them. By virtue of her sympathy she would have been, in a double role, Essex Etheredge, and, at the same time, an Eastern slave or a Plantaganet or Tudor queen. But Rachel could not follow out the reflection. She was closing her eyes for a second and thinking \u2014 of what ? Of Nero fiddling when Rome was burning. She was recalling all the grave duties which were imperatively calling on her young son as Caleb Langton, to discharge them \u2014 all the sad casualties of life. She was seeing, as in a lightning flash, the pinching poverty of her father's house. There was the old clergyman failing day by day, going about his work with a martyr's devotion while there was no possibility of procuring for him the rest and refreshment which might have restored his strength and lengthened his life. There was the young sister whom overwork and insufficient nourishment had sent into a decline, whose weakened lungs never had a respite from the chill mists and smoky vapours of a great northern"], [176, "164 RACHEL LANGTON manufacturing town, never drew a breath of the balmy south while there was yet time. There was the young brother, once of high pro mise, who, after he had been ground down by per petual toil and self-denial, and refused every lawful solace that a passionate nature could crave, was unable to stand the dreariness and hopelessness of the outlook, and fell back on evil courses as a desperate refuge from madness and despair. Rachel opened her eyes again and looked round on a company of gentlefolks at play, unheeding the misery of the world. The next instant she found Essex Etheredge at her side, with an eager appeal in her eyes. ' What do you think of us ? ' she asked, but her words, light perforce, said far less than her glance. ' Are we such a naughty set of people as you have been taught to believe us ? ' The girl's look softened the woman, for it caused her to realise that in sober truth she must disap point the young creature who sought so earnestly to win a reversal of her critic's condemnation. ' There was nothing wrong that I could see,' said Mrs Langton, quite gently. ' It was all very pretty. I do not wonder that those who have the leisure and the heart to spare for such things like them very much. You were the veritable Miss Grace Saville, or whatever her name was ; and Caleb was not amiss in his assumption of being Algernon somebody else, though he was still Caleb Langton all the while. But you will not mind my"], [177, "THE RYELANDS' PLAY 165 saying I do not quite see that the game which has cost you all so much trouble for weeks past, is worth the candle. There is so much to think of and to do in the world, that acting, if this is acting, seems to me a great waste of time ; child's play, only fit for children.' Essex's expressive face fell. It was clear that the future Cabinet Minister's smilingly serious, ' Upon my word, Essex, this is more than I could have looked for from you and your troupe,' with all the praise, which she was getting in full measure on every side, did not make up to her for the narrow - minded disapprobation of one rigid woman, righteous over-much even in her victim's estimation. Presently, Essex's face lit up with a bright in spiration. ' Yes, it is true that all children act parts \u2014 we are, every one of us, players in our youth. Even you must have played to an audience when you were a child, Mrs Langton. You must have kept shop, or kept school, or officiated at a funeral either as the lifeless body or as an over whelmed mourner. I think that is a proof that acting \u2014 the scenic representation of what interests and impresses us, is a necessity of human nature, one of its first necessities. But a little pottering piece of genteel comedy like this we have just given,' she grew grave and began to shake her head, ' it does not so much as stir the depths of human nature, it is trifling child's play as you"], [178, "166 RACHEL LANGTON say. It is a pity there is so much of it on the stage, though it does well enough for an occasion like this. I should like \u2014 I should like to act a true tragedy for you.' There was a rapt look on her face, and she instinctively clasped her flexible hands, though, as a rule, she kept her gestures for the stage. ' Don't mistake me, Mrs Langton,' she hastened to explain ; ' I am perfectly aware that I am at present a very inadequate repre sentative of \" Desdemona \" and \" Ophelia,\" not to say of \" Lady Macbeth \" and \" Queen Katherine,\" still I am going to venture to give my reading of some of Shakespeare's characters in the school room. Mrs Etheredge thinks it is too strong meat for a homely audience, but I do not see it in that light. Why, their daily lives mean strong meat eaten with bitter herbs. They eat their bread in the sweat of their brows. They fight the grim foes of ignorance, want, age, sickness and death. Is that a reason why we should mock them with children's pap ? Will you come and listen to me there ? ' Mrs Langton had already asked herself the question, and answered sardonically, ' In for a penny, in for a pound.' She would not be justi fied in granting a concession to Agatha, which she would not accord to Arthur, though his wife, who had doubtless induced him to provide this questionable amusement for his humble parish ioners, did not merit any grace at her hands."], [179, "THE RYELANDS' PLAY 167 After all, Miss Etheredge was only going to read and recite in the schoolroom. She was an interest ing girl, and she seemed \u2014 if she could be trusted not to be playing a part here also \u2014 to be honestly anxious to defend her profession against one who opposed it on principle. Who knew if, in seeking to convince Rachel, Essex Etheredge might not be herself convinced and led to renounce her sorry trade with its meretricious spangles and artificial thunder ? She looked worthy of a nobler calling. Rachel was not impervious to the credit and distinction of making such a convert. ' I will come,' she said graciously for her ; ' that is, if you will admit such a rude fault-finder.' Agatha caught the first half of the sentence. ' Oh, I am so glad that you have liked our play and are to be present in the schoolroom,' she said to her sister-in-law with effusion, as the hostess took possession of Mrs Langton, while Essex was surrounded by ardent admirers and carried off to be waited upon with cups of tea, iced coffee, claret cup and peaches. ' My dear Rachel, I am doubly glad that you are pleased, because it would have been such a dreadful mortification to dear Essex if you had taken exception to the whole thing. She thinks so much of your opinion \u2014 she admires you so much. You have made a complete conquest of her, and she is not a girl who is easily conquered, or who, when once won, would be quickly turned from her allegiance.'"], [180, "168 RACHEL LANGTON Rachel had a low opinion of herself. She did not see what there was about her to conquer any girl \u2014 a fashionable, much-made-of girl \u2014 a new star in the theatrical world. Of course, Agatha was going too far in the sweet gush which was natural to her. ' I am much obliged to Miss Etheredge for spending a thought on me,' she said drily; 'and I don't know that I'm pleased, Agatha, only the spectacle was pretty enough as a spectacle, and I feel bound somehow to attend the performance in the schoolroom.' ' Wasn't it delicious ? ' Mrs Arthur was saying to all who would listen to her. ' I know I bungled my couple of speeches, but who had attention to spare for me, or the ruck of the company, when they had neither eyes nor ears for anything save Miss Etheredge's beautiful acting. Caleb supported her wonderfully. Caleb was capital. How well matched they are ! What a splendid pair ! ' ' Hush, Eleanor,' said the Rector, impatiently for him, ' set bounds to your enthusiasm ; don't stun us outright' Mrs Arthur made a moue at the unwonted check from her indulgent husband, but her quick-going, heedless tongue was stopped for the moment The Reverend Arthur was sufficiently popular in his parish to cause his schoolroom to be choke full, with not more than a sprinkling of gentry to profit by the provision he was making for the entertain ment of the people. In addition to their goodwill"], [181, "THE RYELANDS' PLAY 169 to their parson, there was a natural curiosity among the homely company to see and hear the play acting Miss, who was also a cousin of Mr and Mrs Etheredge's. Therefore the benches were crowded with gaunt, ungainly figures ; chubby or hard-lined faces prepared to grin and gape to order. To this new audience, Essex, in her clear, pene trating voice, and in a few plain words, gave a brief outline of the circumstances in which each speech was spoken before she gave it. ' A poor man was in terrible peril,' she said, ' from a bad bargain, an unrighteous compact with a Jew, to whom he bound himself to give \u2014 not money, not what stood for his bits of furniture, or his rags of clothes, or the work of his hands for the rest of his days, but a pound of his quivering flesh \u2014 only think of it ! to be cut with a knife and weighed in a scale, if he failed to fulfil his part of the bargain. The bargain itself was so hard and fast that no magistrate or justice dared call it in question. But a woman's wit found a flaw in the cruel bond. A girl in the guise of a lawyer stood forth and pled this wonderful plead ing.' And Essex pled in Portia's name and saved the doomed man, amidst breathless silence at first, and a rude shuffle of applause afterwards. Then Essex told another story, that there was a princess who had an only child, the heir to a great kingdom. She loved him not merely because he would be a mighty king if he lived, she loved him as every mother there loved her bright boy. This"], [182, "170 RACHEL LANGTON mother's boy was taken by a false kinsman and deadly enemy, and was shut up, beyond reach of help, in a strong castle. His rough gaolers sought, at their employer's word, to put out the light of the young eyes ; but the little prince begged so prettily and gently for the common blessing of sight, that the barbarous hands were stayed. They slew him in the end, and his mother mourned for him \u2014 weeping most of all over the sad fancy that when she got to Heaven, if God took her there, she might not know her little Arthur among the shin ing angels. Essex would let them hear how young Arthur smote the stony heart of his first gaoler; and how his mother made her lamentation over her son. And there was a hush in the stuffed, stuffy schoolroom, an intermission of the permanent feet shuffling, a. doubtful stop \u2014 even on the part of the greatest flibbertigibbet of his usual contribution to an entertainment. This was apt to take the shape of sudden, disturbing hoots and whistles, and of aiming such small missiles as peas and pellets of paper at the heads of the performer's companions. The voluntary contribution was wont to shake the decorum of the best-behaved assembly, to madden any speaker who was in the act of blandly address ing the house, and when the flibbertigibbet happened to be \u2014 not one, but a legion, to render the whole scene hideous. But the only interruption to Essex's rendering of the words of Prince Arthur and Princess Con-"], [183, "THE RYELANDS' PLAY 171 stance was the subdued sobbing of more than one woman, the strangled groan of a man, and the long-drawn sighs of bewildered boys and girls arrested in mischief. Again Essex spoke and described an old king who was full of conceit, and believed every word that was said to him. Two of his daughters fooled him to the top of his bent, professed to love him beyond everything, and declared that they were willing to give up all they cared for at his bidding. The third daughter, an honest-hearted girl, said that she could not pretend or promise to do what was beyond her power, and beyond reason, but that she would always be ready to give her father a true daughter's obedience and affection. And what did the silly old man do, but drive away from him his upright, unselfish daughter, who would not say more than she meant, not even to gain his favour and his goods ? He stripped himself to enrich his cunning, lying daughters with all that he had \u2014 his kingdom, his fine houses, his train of servants. The thing which happened was exactly what might have been expected. The false daughters were cruel as well as false. They took all they could get, and when that was done, turned upon their foolish old father, who had ruined himself for their sakes, denied him the barest respect, the coldest comfort, till he had not a roof to shelter him. He had not even poor people's last refuge \u2014 the House \u2014 to go to, for there was not a workhouse in that"], [184, "172 RACHEL LANGTON kingdom in those days. He wandered about, a miserable vagabond outcast, in the darkness and storm of a dreadful night of tempest. Only one faithful friend of better days, and another wretched creature \u2014 a crazy being like the village idiot \u2014 who had chanced to cross the king's path, were with him. In reality his reason too was gone, and it did not need the last misfortune which befel him to send him stark, staring mad. His wicked daughters' shocking ingratitude, his own unspeakable wrongs and sufferings, had robbed him of his poor failing senses before he came stumbling on the wild sea shore. There he beheld the wreck of the ship in which his good daughter had been hurrying to his rescue, and saw her fair body washed up lifeless, as he thought, by the pitiless waves. All was over then. He could but die with her, committing the two to the tender mercy of God. Her inhuman sisters were free to quarrel over their ill-gotten gains and be each other's destruction. Here was what Cordelia, the good daughter, said when her father was so needlessly offended by her plain speaking. Here was what the old king said when he had reaped the wages of his folly, as, with his brain in dire disorder, though the fire in it had died in ashes, he lulled himself to his last rest, watching what he believed was the peaceful sleep of his dead daughter.

What was the nature of the power pos sessed by this girl ? Did it come from above or from beneath, that she should, when she chose, enter into the very heart of the creations of the great play-writer, and realise and reproduce the emotions of men and women removed from her by time, space and every conceivable individual difference ? What was the secret of the gift which could enable her to work upon the feelings of her fellow-creatures \u2014 the most stolid, the most uncul tured, who were usurped, body and soul, as a rule, by the pressing primitive wants of life for them selves and their children ? ' Do you like my reading better than my acting Mrs Langton ? Is it still only child's play ? ' asked the same eager, earnest voice which had appealed to her once before. ' Have play - writers and players any more reason in your mind to exist among those who exercise the honourable and useful callings of this world ? ' Rachel turned upon her hotly.

' No, madam,' said Essex, with unshaken firmness and with sudden dignity, ' it cannot be profane to look reverently into God's work in our spirits as well as in our bodies, and to seek to show it to others, after we have learnt to know it ourselves, for getting ourselves, hiding our faces, and worshipping Him in His mighty acts. It may be long before He deigns to work the miracle on us, summoning into the wilderness of our lives the waters of love and faith, generous devotion and loyal resignation.

'"], [187, "CHAPTER VI A QUARREL BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON Rachel had received a vague, hardly acknow ledged impression, as the play was being acted on the lawn at Ryelands, that while Essex Etheredge had ceased to exist for the moment, so completely was she merged in the young artist, Grace Saville, Caleb's personality was not so absorbed in that of Grace's lover. In fact, it was not difficult to dis cern that Caleb acted a good deal at Essex, for her appreciation and not at the suppositious artist she represented. His mother had set this down partly to the comparative inferiority of his amateur acting, partly to his natural desire to win praise from the professional player. In the same manner Rachel was not without a consciousness that, of all the audience in the school room, Caleb was in some respects the least carried away by the magic of Essex Etheredge's reading. Standing in the background, leaning against the door, he for one never forgot the reader's identity. The tall, slight girl in the simplest of soft, quaint coloured China silk frocks, was never Portia or '75"], [188, "176 RACHEL LANGTON Constance, or Cordelia to him ; she was Miss Essex Etheredge from first to last. Mrs Langton was persuaded that this also was the result of her son's being able to act a little and not a great deal. He was just so far familiar with the art to cause his familiarity to interfere with his perfect enjoyment. He was staring intently at the performer who had lost sight of his existence, in order to detect how she produced the illusion which she could bring about at will. He was studying every note of her voice and measuring its influence, as he was marking every shade of expression which flitted like lightning across her mobile face, in order to get at the secret of her success as a reader and player. Yet though he was not so much under the power of her art as less sophisticated people showed themselves, it went without saying that he was much engrossed with so handsome and inter esting a girl. ' Mother, will you take a turn with me, I have something I wish to say to you ? ' said Caleb, in tercepting his mother as she came in one day, after lunch, from the kitchen garden. She had a fancy to choose and pluck for herself such of the wall fruit as she had a habit of sending weekly during the season, an offering from her to the sufferers in the wards of the infirmary at Westbridge. Caleb took from her the basket with its garnish ing of leaves and its maize-coloured, golden, purple and russet load, and despatched it by one of the"], [189, "A QUARREL BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON 177 gardener's boys to the house, while he directed her steps away from the gardens into the shade and seclusion of the old yew-tree walk It was here, though he did not know it, that his Uncle Arthur and his Aunt Agatha had walked after the death of the old squire, when they discussed their poor prospects, and honestly vied in seeking, the brother with the sister, to save him or her from the worst consequences of the sudden adversity which had befallen them. For that matter, Langtons for centuries back had confided dead secrets to interested listeners under these sombre, gnarled yews. It might have been a proof of instinctive heredity on Caleb's part to take his mother there. If the rooks that affected the gloom of the heavy dark branches had taken account of what was passing below, treasured it up and retailed it, for want of something else with which to create a sensation at a conclave of rooks, many a sage piece of advice from father to son and from mother to daughter, many a thrilling love tale, many a sobbing confession of convicted culprits, much fierce strife of rival kinsmen, would have seen the light prematurely. As it was, few couples who walked and talked beneath the Langton yew trees were at sufficient leisure, where their own affairs were concerned, to specul ate on what might have been the discussions of their predecessors in that select and romantic gallery of confidences. M"], [190, "178 RACHEL LANGTON But Rachel entered it without any engrossing curiosity, far less any premonitory dread with regard to what her son could have to say to her. She was not an inquisitive woman and she had as great faith in his rectitude as in her own. Nevertheless, she was aware of a slight, involun tary shiver as she passed from the broad, brooding August sunshine into the depths of obscurity and lowering darkness of the yew-tree walk. She was also sensible, in an idle way, of the strength of contrast presented by an occasional interval of golden light. This was where an old yew tree had died and been cut down, or another tree had a main branch broken off. Then a patch of sunshine and a bit of turf interposed between the next dark sweep of boughs, and showed green and fresh, except where it was thickly strewn with yellow or russet needles, and now and then a grey cone, purple tinged and crimson tipped. ' Mother,' began Caleb, with an almost imper ceptible effort, ' you and I have always consulted together when I was going to take a step of any consequence \u2014 not that this is exactly a consulta tion,' he broke off to explain candidly, forcing a laugh to hide some lurking confusion ; ' for I have already made up my mind, since, as you will see, it is very much my own business. But I should like to tell you before I have told anyone else.' ' I am much obliged by your confidence, Caleb,' said Mrs Langton, quietly, and with a trifle of"], [191, "A QUARREL BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON 179 demureness. She could not help thinking that Caleb, with all his sense and cleverness, was mak ing a mountain out of some molehill, as youth in its dead earnestness and lack of proportion in measuring the weight of its own concerns is apt to do. Why should he commence with this solemn prelude ? He would be telling her presently that he thought of accepting a commission in the volunteers, or that he had consented to be 'preses' at the next hunt ball, or that he was going to shoot over a northern moor with a college companion, or to join him for a few weeks in a yachting ex pedition to Iceland or Norway. If he had some other communication to make, it could not be any thing more serious than that he had come under a promise to his Aunt Agatha to spend the, first half of the next season under her auspices in town. Therefore it fell upon Rachel like a thunder-bolt when her son said, with the abrupt determination which he had inherited from her, ' I am going to ask Essex Etheredge to marry me.' ' Oh ! no,' she said, standing still, and hardly knowing what she said. ' Never ! Caleb ; you can not propose to do such a foolish, undesirable thing.' ' Why not ? ' he asked sharply, standing still also. ' Have you any objection to Miss Etheredge be yond the fact that she is an actress ? I don't be lieve you have. I am convinced that she is the very girl you would take to, apart from that con sideration."], [192, "180 RACHEL LANGTON ' As the consideration is there \u2014 a grave consider ation which cannot be overlooked,' remonstrated Mrs Langton, coldly, beginning to recover herself and to walk on again, ' there is no use in asking what I should have done apart from it. Besides, I do not know Miss Etheredge well enough to decide whether or not I should have liked her in different circumstances.' ' Whose fault is that ? ' he demanded impatiently. ' You have stood aloof from Aunt Agatha and her party this summer as you never stood before.' ' I wish you would not speak so to me, Caleb ; ' his mother called him to order, indignantly. She had a very strong opinion on the obligation of the fifth commandment. She had always advocated and maintained discipline in every relation of life. In spite of her great love for her son, and the re spect she was disposed to pay him, she had never for a moment forgotten that they were mother and son. She had not encouraged him to take the liberties which women more modern in their views and less rigid in their definitions, permit in their sons. ' It is for me to judge how much I ought to seek your Aunt Agatha and her friends,' she said the next moment. ' Certainly ; I beg your pardon, mother, if I have been rude,' he tried to make amends. ' But it comes to this : Miss Etheredge is my equal by birth \u2014 I have enough worldly goods for both \u2014 you don't wish me to marry money, I suppose, even"], [193, "A QUARREL BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON l8l 4 if there had been any particular call for it ? There, I beg your pardon again,' he said contritely, as he caught the expression of her face. ' I seem de stined to hurt you this morning, though nothing is further from my thoughts \u2014 naturally, since my chief desire is that you should agree with me on this question which \u2014 well, which you can understand is so near my heart. You know that there is not an objection of age or character, or connections, or anything, in short, against Essex Etheredge, except the single obstacle, the one great stumbling-block in your eyes which caused you, from the first, to take umbrage at her as an actress.' ' With reason,' said Rachel, deliberately, as she and Caleb passed under the heaviest shade of the thickest of the yews. ' That she is an actress is an insuperable barrier where I am concerned, as I do not doubt it will be to all your best friends, even to Mrs Etheredge, who has let the girl come in your way.' He held his head higher at the disparagement implied in the words, but he could not contradict her. ' I do not say that it is the only barrier,' Mrs Langton went on with parched lips. ' I have told you already that I, for one, do not know enough of Miss Etheredge to decide whether, if she had been a private gentlewoman, which she is not, she would have been the woman I should have approved of"], [194, "I 82 RACHEL LANGTON as a wife for you. At \"the same time,' she hastened to add, looking wistfully at him, ' I am well aware that the choice does not rest with me. I should shrink from it, if it were possible, believe me. I hope I have always been more than willing to acknowledge your right in this, as in every other matter relating to you, since you grew up.' ' You have been very good,' he said, simply and gravely. ' I have never had any reason to com plain of my mother.' Her heart leapt up in thankfulness at the words ; she turned to him with more freedom and warmth, and with a faintly dawning hope that he might be in duced to see and give up the rashness of his intention. ' You speak of this question as near your heart, my dear Caleb,' she said persuasively. ' It is not an old story and cannot have had hold of your heart or fancy for long. August is not quite over, and your Aunt Agatha with her belongings did not arrive at Ryelands till towards the close of July,' she even condescended to rally him. ' It is long enough,' said Caleb, stoutly, squaring his broad shoulders ; ' perhaps you have forgotten,' he continued, half-loftily, half-shamefacedly, after the fashion of a young man who has hitherto avoided such delicate topics in his conversations with his mother, ' that there is said to be such a thing as love at first sight' Ah ! no, she had not forgotten that short holiday engagement in the capacity of governess, when she"], [195, "A QUARREL BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON 183 came across Gerald Langton and lost her heart to him in the course of a fortnight ! But she had possessed so few friends and lovers to choose from. The life which that dream of a few midsummer days irradiated, as if by enchantment, had been so barren and blank before, was so care-laden and sorrow-stricken afterwards. Her experience was different from that of her son. ' Not that this has been done at first sight,' he was insisting awkwardly. ' I have been closely associated with her for the greater part of these four or five weeks. I have had as many oppor tunities of learning to know and understand her as most fellows have with girls they have been ac quainted with, in an ordinary way, for years.' ' You have been thrown together, along with other young people, on the very absurd and un desirable terms which it seems are inseparable from the getting up of private theatricals in a country house,' said Rachel, severely and disdain fully. ' I should not desire any better terms,' said Caleb, defiantly. Then his mother bethought her that there was something she ought to say to her son before she opposed him farther, something he might not en tirely realise, though it was only bare justice to her that he should lay it to heart. ' Don't think for a moment, Caleb,' she entreated, ' that I do not wish to see you married. There is"], [196, "184 RACHEL LANGTON a saying that no mother, whatever she may feel with regard to her daughter, likes to see her son marry. I am ready to own also, that many a woman in my position \u2014 born to it, looking forward to it as a girl, enjoying it when it came \u2014 does not care to vacate her post to another woman, a much younger woman, who may hold different ideas and demolish all that the older woman has originated and cherished. But indeed it is not so with me. I have never cared to rule ; it has always been a terrible responsibility in my eyes. I am indifferent to the kind of power and influence belonging to the mistress of a great house like Langton Hall, which so many women covet. It has often been an oppressive burden to me ; I have never learnt to prize greatly the luxuries and graces of life. I suppose it is from some radical defect in me that I am such a stoic or cynic. But you believe me, Caleb, at least, you believe me ? ' she pled almost piteously. ' Yes, I believe you, mother,' he granted quickly, pressing her arm with an impulse of tenderness, which revived her. ' Therefore I can afford to be disinterested about your marriage,' she said more calmly ; ' I have al ways looked forward to it as to an event which, if my daughter-in-law were worthy of my son, and I never dreamt that I should have cause to doubt it \u2014 unless in the sense that mothers are proverbially hard to please for their sons, would not merely"], [197, "185 A QUARREL BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON lessen my cares, but would greatly add to, instead of taking from, my happiness. I have been antici pating matters to such an extent,' she finished, with a little tremulous attempt at a jest, ' that I have even been casting my eyes around the neighbour hood for such a snug house \u2014 not too quiet and small to provoke censure of the Squire of Langton Hall for letting his mother retire to such a refuge \u2014 where I could establish myself and look on con tent at your usefulness and happiness, if God would grant us His blessing.' The pair were crossing, as Rachel spoke, one of those bars and flecks of sunshine and verdure where a partial blank in the double row of yew trees let in light and air and the kindly dews of heaven. Without being fully sensible of the change, she felt that the light and life around her were sweet. There came back upon her in a rush a vivid per ception of all those kindly human charities which she had associated with Caleb when she had seen him a power for good in his generation. He should be the head of a house representing the old stock from which he had sprung, and the old hall where his fathers had dwelt before him. He should have a wife modest and tender like the first Mrs Arthur, whom Rachel had loved, a clergyman's daughter, too, perhaps, a lady to the heart's core and at the same time a home-taught, country-bred girl. Her husband should be her lord and master, and her home her kingdom. Her children, hers and Caleb's,"], [198, "186 RACHEL LANGTON should play round an old woman's knee and call her grandmother. At the recollection of the lost dream, a quiver passed across Rachel's face, and she turned aside her head, for she did not wish her son to see her break down. As for him, he was holding her arm tightly and saying eagerly : ' In Heaven's name, then, mother, why should it not be? That is if Essex will consent ; if she refuse, I do not believe that I shall ever care for another girl. But that is neither here nor there just now. Where can I find a wife like her? She is a splendid creature, and she holds you in the highest honour. Oh, mother, you cannot be so illiberal as to regard that one objection \u2014 as it seems to you \u2014 insuperable. She would ennoble any profession as she would dignify any station.' ' I suppose I am illiberal,' answered Rachel in a low, sad tone, ' for the objection is insuperable to me. I know very little of the theatre, of course, though I went to see your play. But from what I have read and can picture to myself nothing will convince me that a young girl can run the gauntlet of the green-room and the footlights uninjured. If nothing else, the bloom of her girlhood must be rubbed off; the reserve of a fine character which does not wear its heart on its sleeve must be de stroyed. For its owner has wasted on a multitude the secret treasures of thought and feeling which should have been kept for one person only.'"], [199, "187 A QUARREL BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON ' Where do you see the signs of such deteriora tion in the young lady of whom we are speaking ? ' asked Caleb, with angry hauteur. ' I never knew you were so sentimental ; I should not have looked for such bosh from you.' 'Another thing,' went on his mother, courage ously, steeling herself alike against his resentment and his sneers, ' there is no fact more universally acknowledged than that a woman who has had a public career \u2014 an actress \u2014 cannot, in her youth at least, content herself with a domestic life. She is constantly hankering after the excitement of the stage, and craving the bouquets and bravos of the boxes, the hand-clappings of the pit and galleries.' ' And why should she not have them if she wants them ? ' cried Caleb, recklessly. ' Teaching the world from the stage is a more venerable practice, and likely to be a good deal more effectual \u2014 not to say comprehensive \u2014 than mopeing by the fire side, and rehearsing the Church Catechism, even to the senior class in the Sunday school.' ' Oh ! Caleb, Caleb,' protested his mother, and said no more. If Caleb, or any young man, in whatever rank, could calmly contemplate his future wife's going on the stage without him, his frame of mind was too deplorable to contend with. If he even cherished the mad idea of relinquishing his duties as a squire and acting along with her, as Nero forgot the claims of his empire in proposing to"], [200, "188 RACHEL LANGTON render himself illustrious in the circus, his condition was equally beyond remonstrance, if it was not past praying for.

It did not even enter Rachel's head, seeing the kind of woman she was, to summon a conclave of the young squire's nearest relations.

Above all, with Rachel's sensitive feelings where her son's independence was concerned, she could not call in help in order that he might be badgered and coerced even for his good. The affair settled itself in an incredibly short space of time. That very evening Caleb withdrew precipitately, not from Ryelands, but from another country house in the neighbourhood, where he had an engagement to meet the Etheredges' party. So small a trifle as the accident that the country house in question had an ornamental sheet of water in the grounds, a miniature lake furnished with a miniature boat-house, was enough to precipitate the catastrophe. Caleb gained his point in rowing out on the sublimated dark pond the very girl who for the last two days had begun to show a great re luctance to be left alone in his company. Here was the opportunity, not so much ready made as schemed and striven for, which the ardent lover was not sufficiently chivalrous (in a fantastic fashion) to forego. Here was the chance for Caleb to utter the passionate ' Will you ? ' and for Essex Etheredge to reply with the grave, emphatic, ' Not on any account.' Arrived at home, Caleb shut himself into his room for a time, and then came and bade his"], [203, "CONDOLENCES AND CONGRATULATIONS 191 mother good-night with a deadly calm and suavity which nearly brought her heart into her mouth.

I feel sure that you will know, indeed, he said as much as that he had told you before he spoke to me. Therefore I can let myself say how dreadfully sorry I am.

I shall be gone, on some excuse, before this note reaches you. I do hope you will forgive me. You are great enough to forgive far heavier wrongs, even to your son.

Rachel was enough of a woman to be only partially consoled by Caleb's escape because Essex Etheredge had refused him \u2014 refused him, judging"], [204, "192 RACHEL LANGTON from the tone of her letter, in an unqualified and decisive manner which would prevent any renewal of his addresses on a later occasion. It was well in one sense, and she ought to be thankful, but in another her son's disappointment and mortifi cation were hers. She could not hold many girls justifiable in refusing him without an instant's hesitation. Miss Essex Etheredge must be hard to please. Her profession must, in truth, be a despotic and exacting master, a consuming passion \u2014 or was she, as Agatha had hinted, reserving her fascinations for a coronet, for wealth and state to which poor Caleb's pretensions as a simple, well to-do squire were as nothing ? It was diffiuclt to imagine that the day would not come when Essex Etheredge would regret the summary dismissal of the honest, ingenuous heart, the manly, comely person, the fair estates which had been unreservedly laid at her feet. Neither did Rachel believe that Caleb would get over 'this mistake,' as his fancy-free, un wounded mistress called it, so easily as she predicted \u2014 judg ing of her son's nature by his mother's, which was all she had to gauge it by. Rachel could not think that, young as he was, the hurt so carelessly in flicted, so lightly weighed, by the dealer of the blow, would be as skin-deep as the offender com forted herself by believing.

How often is such a secret, highly stimulating and entertaining, kept inviolate, or wholly hidden, from curious, sympathetic or mocking eyes ? Not twice twelve hours had elapsed before Agatha Etheredge arrived at Langton Hall alone, full of regrets and self-reproaches. ' I am so sorry, dear, so ashamed. It must seem to you that I have been shockingly blind and wretchedly careless. But we are all accustomed to have poor Essex admired and run after, and who would have expected poor dear Caleb to be hard hit so soon ? I felt secure in her devotion to her profession, and in the fact that it was out of the question for her to marry a man who was not of sufficient rank or wealth to dispense with pre cedents. I ought to have given more thought to the boy's danger. I can only suppose I was led to believe, after what I once said to you on the subject, that he was forewarned, and that he was sufficiently quick and knew enough of the world to understand the position.

Mrs Etheredge declined to be exonerated, and positively N"], [206, "194 RACHEL LANGTON the tears glistened in her bright eyes. ' You must be so provoked with me for having brought Essex down here, and for deciding to have that garden play. But there is nothing dearest Ben enjoys after his work like a play, even an amateur play, which is excessively good of him, for, of course, he has a great deal of dramatic talent and taste (they are in the family) and cannot help seeing all the faults and blunders. After the treat to Ben, I did think an open-air play would be a pleasant novelty to our country neighbours, and they all professed to like it immensely. ' Don't apologise, Agatha,' repeated Mrs Lang ton, wearily. She had been sitting listening like an automaton ; she roused herself to do what was required of her. 'You and Mr Etheredge \u2014 the neighbours, too, for that matter, had a perfect right to entertain yourselves as you thought fit. You could not, as you say, foresee what was to happen, or anticipate the full extent of a young fellow's rashness and recklessness.' 'Yes, it was very rash and reckless of dear Caleb,' said Agatha, plaintively, ' for I am sure he had not a particle of encouragement to do as he did. Essex is absolutely free from coquetry. She is almost ridiculously in earnest in real life. And you were so good in coming to the play and being pleased. Dear, dear ! it seems a poor return for your kindness.' ' Don't mention it,' Mrs Langton said a third"], [207, "CONDOLENCES AND CONGRATULATIONS 195 time, speaking more restively than before ; ' I went to see for myself, and I was not like my neigh bours, for I did not quite like it, but that is not to the point. It was all Caleb's doing, and he was justified in doing it, in the light in which matters appeared to him. It would almost certainly have happened later, when he met Miss Etheredge and saw her play in London.' ' I am sure I wish I could think so,' said Agatha, dispiritedly. 'It is like you to suggest it to relieve my mind,' she added with more animation. ' But in London it would have been different,' shak ing her head anew. ' There are so many people and so many distractions in town. Caleb might have heard and seen enough to open his eyes to the truth that, good and charming as Essex is, she would be an utterly unsuitable match for him. He ought to think of other people, not of himself alone. He is the head of the house and responsible for its welfare. It is not as if he were a man of no family with no hereditary ties. That is why I believe you are not altogether right, Rachel, dear, when you say that he was justified in doing as he did, in proposing to marry Essex Etheredge in the light in which he saw the marri age.

' The mischief is not irreparable \u2014 far from it. An affaire du c\u0153ur, even when it comes to nothing, is not a bad thing for a young man like Caleb, not at all bad when the object is worthy.

At the same time, it gets rid of idle fancifulness and superfluous sentiment which might hamper him in after life.,# It steadies him.' ' Does it ? ' asked Rachel, a little incredulously and drearily. She was thinking of that unfortunate brother of hers who went to the dogs. The first step in his way to so undesirable an end had been an unrequited affection for a girl whom he would have had no chance of winning, though he had been permitted to court her for twice the number of years Jacob waited for Rachel. True, it might have been said by her of Rachel Langton's family, their manners had not ' that repose Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere. ' Yes, indeed,' Agatha was answering with her"], [209, "CONDOLENCES AND CONGRATULATIONS 197 suave confidence. ' You will find that when dear Caleb next thinks of marrying, he will not forget his position and its requirements. Very likely he will make some highly advantageous marriage.' Rachel had well nigh said sorrowfully, ' I should not care to see it,' but she refrained. Mrs Langton had the same ordeal to go through with the Rector. He came himself to condole with and congratulate her in one breath on Caleb's absurd idea of the quarter in which he ought to find a wife, and on the mercy vouchsafed to him in the failure of his purpose. The Rev. Arthur also felt it incumbent on him to re quire his wife's company in the visit, because it was a family trouble and a family danger narrowly escaped, and poor Rachel, who had been wonder fullyt compliant not so long ago, should be sym pathised with and encouraged. The Hall and the Rectory had continued on visiting terms, though it was visiting terms of the most freezing description. 'You know I don't agree with you in this, Arthur,' Mrs Arthur had protested, seeking to get off from the unpalatable duty imposed upon her. To do her justice, she had no wish to exult, even with modified exultation, over her enemy's mortifi cation.

I wish their tastes had been more in my line, but though both of them ride, of course, they don't go in for it as they ought. Caleb rides straight enough when he is in the mood, and takes his fences as if he were my son instead of my nephew. So would she, with a little coaching. She has not at all a bad seat for a girl who has been all for reading and studying. She would have left the stage, of course. A squire's wife could not have gone on acting, unless for charities, and these could not have been always in want of her assistance, though the world is poor enough I am sure. She might have had,' with a ma licious intonation, ' a few benefits for poor clergy men and clergywomen, not to say for the curates' fund, when there would have been bumper nights. Then such private theatricals as we might have had in every house in the neighbourhood all the year round ! The officers at Westbridge would have given their heads for Mrs Caleb Langton's help and advice. I say, your Reverence, you don't know half my gifts. I am satisfied that if I had got a little more practice, I should have been a perfect \" dab \" at waiting-women and old hags.' ' There is a time for everything, even for talking nonsense, Eleanor,' he told her, gloomily. ' If you do not agree with the rest of us, you can at least be civil and hold your tongue. You must surely feel"], [211, "CONDOLENCES AND CONGRATULATIONS 199 sorry that Caleb, poor fellow, has come to grief already through something that we have had a hand in.' ' Well, Arthur, I should be sorry if he had come to grief from any other cause than Essex Ether edge's hard-heartedness, his mother's dumps and your fads. If Essex had not been so stony, I tell you frankly I should have done my best to pull the couple through in triumph, all the more because Mrs Langton is a horrid prig, and the rest of you, even Agatha on this point \u2014 pardon me, my dear \u2014 dreadful old fogies. If I can do nothing else I can play gooseberry and daisy-picker capitally ; you are not half alive to my talents, sir.' Then Rachel grew almost fierce in defence of Caleb's independence. It was all his doing, and though she could not approve of it, or regret Miss Etheredge's decision \u2014 certainly not; he was en titled to judge for himself. She c^uld feel for his pain, for the blight on his springtime, as it seemed none of his other friends could feel. ' It would never have done, Rachel, never,' said Arthur, in a tone of conviction, his ordinarily genial voice sounding solemn and stern, as he stalked up and down the spacious drawing-room at the Hall. ' When I think of my mother \u2014 and you,' he added, by an after thought, ' and try to fancy an actress from the London boards, even though the actress is Essex Etheredge, in your place, the thing is in credible \u2014 impossible. I suppose sense is not to be"], [212, "200 RACHEL LANGTON expected from a young man in Caleb's circum stances, but it is a mercy the girl had the judgment to see her disqualifications. I trust there will be no more of this imbecility on the boy's side.' Rachel could have answered him, ' If the girl's profession was such as to set her aside and forbid to her the commoner, safer, happier lot of women, why did you behave as if you thought her calling was quite lawful and a thing you \u2014 a clergyman, could avail yourself of without scruple ? It is like treating hangmen as monsters and yet insisting on the necessity of capital punishment, which always implies the existence of hangmen.' It was a positive relief to turn to Mrs Arthur and see her wagging the golden chrysanthemums in her hat, putting up her double chin and asserting in a spirit of contradiction that she thought Miss Ether edge an exceptionally fine girl. It was hard on her to have her visit to Ryelands cut short. Her feelings ought to be considered. There were two sides to a question. As if the statement of that in disputable fact helped anybody, or as if anybody questioned that Essex Etheredge was a fine, even a rarely-gifted, girl. Caleb, who was after all the principal offender, managed to steer clear of the commotion in the family and of the calls of condolence and con gratulation. In truth, his relatives, with an in stinctive perception of his self-reliant, masterful character, were remarkably chary of intruding"], [213, "CONDOLENCES AND CONGRATULATIONS 201 themselves into his confidence and inflicting on him lectures and reprimands. The uncle and the aunts showed themselves very tender of his feel ings, and cautious of impairing their influence over him. If he had not been the squire of Langton Hall it might have been different. The Ether edges and Arthur Langton were ready to pay him much delicate attention suitable to the strait. They would have had him constantly at their houses to be petted and figuratively patted on the back. They would have carried him into com pany, were it only to divert his mind from his unwarrantable disappointment. According to their view, it was a misadventure not to be lamented over, but to be devoutly thankful for. Cabel Langton's relations conducted themselves, however unconsciously, as if they entertained a vague dread that his mother's son was not to be lightly tampered with. He had hitherto shown himself a nice lad enough, but he might at any moment fly off at a tangent and break into utter insubordination where social laws were concerned. It was poor Rachel who had to bear the brunt of the misfortune. She had to listen to all the jeremiads, to accept all the advice \u2014 she who had not provoked the casualty by her illogical care lessness and plastic principles. Caleb, too, turned upon her and contrived to blame her for the failure of his unreasonable hopes. Perhaps it was only natural for him, in the soreness"], [214, "RACHEL LANGTON 202 of spirit produced by his unequivocal dismissal at the hands of his mistress, to catch at anything which could break the blow. He told himself that the girl was proud and high-spirited, as well as heart and soul in her acting, and that the probable attitude which his kindred \u2014 notably his mother, would take in reference to the marriage was likely to weigh unduly with Essex Etheredge in giving him his answer. She had taken a great fancy to his mother, and Essex was just the high-minded, dis interested young woman who would refuse to be come a bone of contention between mother and son. She would make up her mind rather to decline to listen to the pleadings of her heart in his favour, than to consent to alienate him know ingly from his oldest and dearest friend. It did not signify with regard to the result that Caleb was thoroughly wrong in his surmise. Essex Etheredge was neither weakly sentimental and yielding, nor full of the false heroism of an un called for self-sacrifice. She would have been the first to recognise his and her indefeasible rights in the matter. She would have seen clearly how far his mother's claim on his submission extended, and where in the name of all true manliness it stopped. If she had felt at that time any faint throb or thrill of love for him \u2014 it would have been no slight love even in its beginning, she could not easily have given him up, though not his mother alone, but the whole world had stood in armed array between them."], [215, "CONDOLENCES AND CONGRATULATIONS 203 But the persuasion in which Caleb indulged, saved his self-esteem a little, and served as a safety-valve, for the moroseness with which rejected men, re jected lads especially, are apt to be beset. Caleb was relentlessly cold and reserved to his mother, while he made no further reference \u2014 not the most distant \u2014 to the subject which they had discussed beneath the yew trees. He scouted, as far as silent withdrawal could scout, the idea of compensation and solace from the hand which had ministered not unsuccessfully to his more youthful trials. All the time, Rachel, who was a sombre-minded woman at the best, with a turn for ingenious self torture, imagined she saw her big, broad-shouldered son growing manifestly pale and thin in his moody brooding and solitary self-communing. She re called with sick terror that his father died while still a young man. She reckoned up, growing cold in the reckoning, the number of years between Caleb's age and that of Gerald Langton at his death. She considered sadly that such an affaire du c\u0153ur, as Agatha had called it, treating it as an ordinary, not altogether unsatisfactory, process in the education of a young man in Caleb's position \u2014 such an outrageous blunder, as his Uncle Arthur had classed his nephew's aberration, had served ere now, in the history of primitive humanity, to break stout hearts and wreck embittered minds."], [216, "204 CHAPTER VIII SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK Rachel Langton had, from the date of her marriage, drifted steadily away from her own family. She had not been unfaithful to them and to the past in any sense, but both she and her brothers and sisters had objected to their taking up a subordinate position in relation to the Langtons. In addition, she had always entertained a strong feeling of what was due to the Langtons in the arbitrary connection which had been established between her and them. Thus, when Rachel's father and mother died, and her brothers and sis ters went their several ways, and were widely scattered \u2014 emigrating, losing themselves in the great manufacturing towns at home, marrying, and becoming one after another swallowed up in foreign interests and domestic cares, she lost sight of her people in a great measure. The men and women ceased to claim her sympathy and assistance ; and, as a natural though regrettable result, gave up also answering her letters. It was a startling surprise to her, therefore, to receive a few lines from her youngest sister Sophy,"], [217, "SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK 205 ten years her junior. The note was written on half a sheet of shabby letter paper in a strong clear, business hand, and was to this effect : \u2014 ' Dear Rachel, \u2014 We have not seen each other for an age, and I am not sure that we should know each other if we met in a crowd.

How old was I at the time of your marriage? A gaunt, precocious slip of a woman, when I ought to have been a simpering miss of fifteen. I am now a strong-minded, confirmed spinster of thirty-five. I warn you beforehand. \u2014 Yours faithfully, Sophy Green. ' What is your son like ? But I'll see for myself if you'll let me.' ' Why, this letter is from your Aunt Sophy, the youngest of my sisters,' exclaimed Mrs Langton, in a good deal of bewilderment and excitement,"], [218, "206 RACHEL LANGTON standing with the letter in her hand, and appealing to Caleb who was in the room with her. The letter had come by the afternoon post, the last post for the day at Langton, and had been delivered between lunch and five o'clock tea. The letters which came at this hour were always carried into the library, and Mrs Langton, on returning from a drive, had invaded her son's peculiar territory to see if there was anything there for her. She expected a reply to an order she had sent to a Westbridge tradesman, an announcement of the cottage flower show, of which she was one of the patronesses, perhaps a card from Agatha. Caleb was sitting with his back to her. He did not look round or put down his magazine as he would have done a month before. He barely re sponded to the exclamation addressed to him. ' Haven't the honour of the lady's acquaint ance,' Rachel understood him to mutter with a jerk of his shoulders. At any other time she would have freely remon strated with him on his inattentive indifference, and would have had a good-humoured apology from him, but their present relations were so different that she could only say very stiffly. ' She says she is coming here next week, Caleb.' ' Why should not she ? ' he asked, still with profound unconcern, but he had the grace to get up and face his mother. ' She has never been here before,' said Rachel,"], [219, "SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK 207 doubtfully. ' I have not seen her since I left Cumberland, hardly, indeed, from the time of my marriage. I do not know what she has been doing with herself for a number of years.

' suggested Caleb, with a philo sophic gravity, which was sardonic in its character. ' But, Caleb,' said his mother, still more formally, ' this house is yours, you are the master here. It is for you to say whether you choose to receive, on a moment's notice, an aunt of whom you know next to nothing, whom you cannot even remember to have seen.' Caleb was roused at last ' Good Heavens ! mother,' he cried, angrily, ' do you count me such a cur as to grudge your having your sister here ? I cannot tell what I have said or done that you should entertain such a mean opinion of me,' and he walked out of the room with an air of offended dignity, which said as plainly as an air could say, ' I can be magnanimous ; you have done your best successfully to keep me from getting the desire of my heart, but the very last thing I should think of doing would be to interfere and deprive you of any paltry indulgence \u2014 such as"], [220, "208 RACHEL LANGTON receiving a sister whom you have not cared to see for nearly a score of years.' Rachel looked after his retreating figure and felt doubly reluctant that he should encounter any of her family in such a humour, but it seemed as if the meeting could not be helped. In the beginning of the following week, Sophy Green walked in one morning without any further announcement of her arrival than what was con tained in the speech of the puzzled, half-abashed man-servant. ' A lady to see you, ma'am, as won't wait or listen to hany objection on the score of the hour and of you and Mr Langton's being right in the middle of your breakfast. Says as how her name is \" Sophy Green.\" You know her and her business, so she'll come to you straight.' It wa; very early for a visitor, seeing that the Langtons were not ' late people,' and the squire and his mother were, as their footman had ex pressed, ' right in the middle of their breakfast.' The intruder had not waited, she was at the servant's back, and as he stepped aside, she passed him without ceremony. ' Well, Rachel, I should have known you any where,' she said, advancing into the room, and showing not the slightest symptom of agitation or awkwardness ; on the contrary, she was reassuringly at her ease. ' I must confess I could not be sure of Caleb \u2014 this is Caleb, ain't it ? ' turning with a nod"], [221, "SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK 209 and a laugh in the direction of her nephew. ' Why sir, the last time I saw you, for I did see you once before, I held you in my arms.' ' My dear Sophy,' Mrs Langton had started up, and was saying in a tremor \u2014 calm, composed woman as she was naturally, ' where have you sprung from at this unheard-of hour ? Were you too early to get a cab at the station ? How did you find your way ? What have you done with your luggage ? ' ' I am Caleb,' the young squire was saying with a commendable effort to be polite and hospitable, ' and I should have been at your service before the end of your journey, Aunt Sophy, if you had given me the chance.' The stranger touched Mrs Langton's cheek with her lips, as a concession to their relationship. She shook Caleb's hand with a good, manly hand-shake, which was evidently more in her way than was any form of kissing. Then she sat down and laughed a little \u2014 clearly deriving some amusement from the discomfiture of the others,and relishing the sensation she created. ' The hour ! ' she repeated. ' Why, the sun has been up, and the harvest people have been at their work hours ago. There was a cab at the station ; but what was I going to do with a cab when I can tramp twice the distance without the slightest inconvenience, and with no small enjoy ment generally ? Carriages are for the old and sick, or, if they are not, they ought to be.

We are to have a Servants' League immediately.' The woman who was talking this extravagant balderdash, as it sounded to Caleb Langton, was a magnificent creature, and the absolute plain ness of her dress enhanced, instead of detracting from, her splendid proportions and grand colouring. She was one of those women who are wonderfully independent of dress and surroundings, so that, though her style was totally opposed to rags and dirt, even in rags and dirt she would have been a strikingly handsome woman. As it was, her clothes were sensibly chosen and perfectly good of their kind, thus fulfilling the great obligations of wear ing apparel. Sophy Green dressed for utility, and the highest utility is very near to the highest beauty. Her dress was not that of any religious order, whether of a Church of England sisterhood or of the Salvation lasses, neither was it the dress of any institution of nurses. After all, such costumes are often, with the best intentions, as cumbrous and as ill-suited to their wearers and to the occasions on"], [223, "SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK 211 which they are worn as the different garbs are alike in being conspicuously ugly and unbecoming. It is as if they were intended to be a continual mor tification, like sackcloth and ashes, to the female flesh which adopts them. Sophy Green was clad according to independent taste and requirements, and according to the season of the year \u2014 an ordinary consideration which is, however, not always attended to in rational dressing. It was still early autumn, which is often the hottest of the four seasons, so the wearer's gown was one of those strong, serviceable, washing-for ever ginghams which, in their soft, fast browns and lilacs, are always fresh when they are clean. They are neither a burden to the body nor an offence to the eye. The straight, severe lines, and good, plain fit, set off a fine figure to the best advantage. If the skirt was divided to render the feet free, the division was ingeniously made as imperceptible as possible. The time has gone by when even the most fantastic of strong minded women would, whatever her calumniators and caricaturists may say, seek to mimic men's attire by the grotesque travesty of the Bloomer costume. She leaves that to her weaker sister, the bicyclist. The strong-minded woman has more to do in this generation \u2014 she has the sorrows and wrongs of the mass of humanity on her shoulders. She has neither the time nor the inclination to in dulge in masquerading ; she knows, besides, that"], [224, "212 RACHEL LANGTON her womanliness is a great weapon in the cause she is fighting. She has no wish to turn her back on her womanliness. For a covering to her head, Sophy Green wore \u2014 instead of a close, choky, poky bonnet with a streaming veil or a flapping, teasing hood \u2014 black, blue or grey \u2014 a convenient, shady hat. It was not a sailor's hat, or a hat perched above her eyebrows, or an apology for a hat in the shape of a handful of artificial flowers twisted together, or a ' picture hat ' as big as the hat of an old cavalier, or a Gains borough hat turned up at one side. It was a hat with a crown just high enough to hold the head, and a brim just broad enough to protect the face, above all, the eyes, which Sophy Green always treated with the greatest respect, though her eyes \u2014 great, lively, steel-blue eyes \u2014 had not failed her yet. In winter, the hat would be replaced by a bonnet of quilted silk or velvet, large enough and warm enough to save its owner from neuralgia. At the same time, the gingham gown would be changed for a gown of serge or cloth, with a thick jacket or a still thicker ulster, tailor-made, for Sophy had many friends in the fraternity of tailors. Her brown hands were shapely, though they were sometimes work-worn. She went with them bare most frequently. When they were gloved, her tan gloves were, like her black leather shoes, what they professed to be, and completed a chaussure fit for any kind of weather. It was adopted for use, in"], [225, "SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK 213 the first place, but it was not necessarily un couth. No doubt, in that Gladstone bag of hers, Sophy Green carried \u2014 in addition to her comb and brush and sponge bags, and her real work-bag \u2014 her change of linen and her second gingham gown, that ' the one might wash the other,' in homely phraseology, such an easily - disposed - of, light waterproof as could be quickly pulled out to shelter her in a shower. The en tout cas, which served her either for sunshade or umbrella, was there in readiness to bear the waterproof company. When Rachel Langton came first to Langton Hall, she was a fine - looking young woman of a severe, subdued type. She had early lost her husband, who had been her first and only love ; she lived for her boy. But there was nothing severe or subdued about her sister Sophy. She had lost nothing that she had ever greatly cared for. Her husband and children were the great body of sufferers among the nations, not the English sufferers alone, but the victims in every country, under every rule, where there was a galling yoke, an unrighteous tyranny. She claimed the men and women deprived of their just rights, struck down, trodden under foot, gasping, rather than shrieking, a despairing protest. Here were the men and women earning bread in the sweat of their brows, and denied more than a crust in return for their labours."], [226, "214 RACHEL LANGTON Here were the captives, thralls to ignorance, to vice, to the unthinking exactions of fellowmen, to the cruel persecution of deluded, short - sighted enemies. She mothered the waifs and strays from their birth, whose inarticulate wailing rises all over the world, and enters into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. The mighty load of such a substitute for hus band and children had not crushed Sophy Green. It had brought out in her all the amazing heroism of which she was capable, all the wonderful energy and depths of pity which no drain on their sources could exhaust. These were crossed with flashes of humour from her stores of experience \u2014 which had a light as well as a dark side, humour which saved her enthusiasm from degenerating into mere rhodomontade, or from breaking out into disastrous ebullitions of wild, hopeless riot and lawlessness. Yet Sophy had not hesitated at lawlessness, when she had found the laws to be an organised system of oppression ; she had been guilty of aiding and abetting great and small plots, and insurrec tions in countries where these are the only spas modic and fitful proofs that freedom is not stark dead. Sophy Green's name was known to the police of more than one foreign capital, and she had, in spite of the panoply which shields a British subject for life, a score of entries against her. All the glow, all the bountifulness of womanhood which had been lacking in Rachel Langton in her"], [227, "SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK 215 prime, were present in her sister Sophy in her solitary estate and in the debatable commission which she believed she held. She was one of those women whose personal attractions are in their perfection, not when they are in the green adolescence of their girlhood, but when their years are between thirty and forty and for ten years to come. As tall as her sister Rachel or as Essex Etheredge, and sumptuously large in proportions, she was yet without an ounce of superfluous fat cumbering her muscle. The active, unresting, toilsome life for others, and the temperance in food and drink, which was also for others, while it was her glory, effectually destroyed any tendency to well-bred embonpoint, which is the euphemistic designation for vulgar corpulence. Her fine features were probably heavy in youth, they were now simply of a massiveness which was in keeping with her figure. There was not a coarse line in them, neither was there a coarse tint in the clear, warm, gipsy-like colouring which belonged to an exuber ance of life and strength, exercise to the full, and very often as much of an open air existence as if she had been a gipsy. There was one startling contradiction in the middle of her wealth of vigour, her hair, which, if it had been unbound from its loose coils, would have spread over her shoulders and reached below her waist, was of the same silvery whiteness as was her sister Rachel's hair. The whiteness had nothing to say that was out of"], [228, "216 RACHEL LANGTON keeping with Rachel's pale, set face, her somewhat hollow cheeks and drooping eyes. The early silver ing of the hair might have been a peculiarity of the family constitution shared by the sisters. Or it might have been that Sophy Green, courageously self-controlled and resolutely helpful as she was in the tremendous task which she had set herself, was still not invulnerable from head to heel. The iron of the woes, which she sought to stem, might have entered into her own soul. But the snowy hair only lent the last touch of distinction to a head noble enough in its power to have worn a crown. It was a more exquisite powdering than the perfec tion of art ever supplied to the daintiest of mar guises, the most irresistible of dames de salon. The best of it was that she did not care a straw for her stately beauty, except as an instrument with which she could wage war against the foe. She hardly minded her appearance in other respects, save that she saw it to be her duty to set an example of ab solute cleanliness, neatness and general propriety of apparel. It was not of marquises ox dames de salon that Sophy Green reminded her contemporaries. They asked themselves quite other questions. Was Deborah, the Hebrew prophetess who judged Israel, like Sophy ? Did she bear any marked resemblance to Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, or to Judith who slew the enemies of the Lord and his people without either fear or ruth ? Had Charlotte Corday been a younger Sophy Green ?"], [229, "SOPHY GREEN AND HER WORK 217 It would be a mistake to suppose that Sophy had gone unwooed in her magnificent womanhood. A record of the number and variety of her wooers would have formed a tolerably extensive, highly edifying and entertaining chronicle. But to all her suitors she had given the same reply. She would wed no man. She was wedded to the poor and needy of her people \u2014 of all peoples. It was much the same answer as that which the Virgin Queen of England gave to her loyal sub jects when they pressed on her a prince consort But in Sophy Green's case the motive which prompted the speech was purer, loftier, more unmixed with selfish pride and ambition, while the speaker was more sincere. Sophy had not been an hour at Langton Hall before she had made searching inquiries as to the prospects of the co-operative stores which had been started at Westbridge, and had asked Caleb whether his labourers were ' remove men,' or were still bond slaves to the farmers and to him \u2014 their squire? The questions tickled her hearers. They were in clined at first to think her a harmless monomaniac \u2014 a ' people's rights woman ' \u2014 to be borne with and laughed at. But they could not be an hour in her company without realising that, monomaniac or not, she was a power in her generation, a grand creature made to influence thousands. She came into the heart of their domestic fret and torment, and her talk was of the stirring of the nations, with a"], [230, "218 RACHEL LANGTON horizon as wide as the world. She arrested them by the very magnitude of her hopes and fears, plans and projects. She thrilled them by her true tales, unembellished in their naked tragic horror of the dens of sweaters, the slums of direst poverty and pestering disease, 'the sinks and sewers of ini quity into which she was bound to enter and do battle to her latest breath. She was not weakly flowery or bombastically grandiloquent in her speech. She had kept company with plain people in deadly earnest, and she called a spade a spade without flinching ; withal, her speech had much of the spell of the highest oratory. When her stories would have overwhelmed her small audience and sunk them in the nether pit of despair for their kind, she relieved the lurid gloom by the sparkle of her wit and the intenseness of her earnestness. She detailed the comical incongruities she had encountered in her strange path. She awoke flashes of interest in recounting the hair-breadth escapes she and others had effected in their ex ceptional careers. Sophy startled Caleb into feeling himself a poor, selfish wretch of a sighing and dying swain, caring only for his sentimental disappointment.

Indeed, Sophy did not hesitate to tell her sister so. Sophy was not after the pattern of gracious, cooing Agatha Ether edge. It was not a sweet-meat like pleasure, but bread, which is the staff of life, that she was sacri ficing herself in order to bring nearer to the starv ing multitudes. ' No, Rachel,' she asserted un hesitatingly, ' it is not your dignified condescending Ladies Bountiful who will do any good at this time of day, or they will do so little, and that marred by so much accompanying mischief, that it is not worth counting.

It took Caleb and his mother by storm nearly. It was a great dis traction at first, and they were inclined to draw long breaths of the keen, rarified air, and to wel come it as life-giving and health-restoring. Then the reaction set in where Rachel was in question. Sophy was wonderful, admirable in a sense, but she was something of a white elephant, or of the more homely bull in a china shop, as a visitor in a house like Langton Hall. There was not a particle of domesticity left in her ; this was the one thing which to some of her admirers de tracted from the free, unshackled beauty of her person and character. She called herself ' a social vagabond,' and there were traces of the higher moral Bohemian about her, such as are wont to attach to women with missions, without settled homes, or whose homes are the least of their care. The femi nine element in such women either dwindles till it becomes extinct, or only survives in the cravings of"], [234, "222 RACHEL LANGTON an unappeasable vanity. To those who have been brought up with a prejudice for femininity, the energetic restlessness, hardy regardlessness, roving, mildly rollicking attributes, which replace the old, timidly gentle traits, are more or less repellent. Sophy Green had an utter contempt for conven tional practices. 'You don't expect me to dress for dinner, I hope, Rachel,' she said the first time the Langton Hall dinner-bell rang in her hearing ; ' I haven't the dress, so there's an end of it. But in any circumstances I should never comply with such a senseless, contemptible waste of time and trouble, such a relic of barbarism. Yes, I call it a relic of barbarism rather than a mark of high civilisation to devote so much money and labour to solemnly decking out the human body in honour of feeding-time. Why should any person make a fashionable guy of the poor, tired, tortured thing, ex posing it to all the ills that flesh is heir to, in the shape of horrid chills and fevers ? I trust that it is I myself, my moral and spiritual self, and not my clothes that you and Caleb desire to sit down with at this hour. By the way, it is a preposterous hour for dinner ; however, that is easily settled. Call it supper to relieve your common sense, eat only of such light, wholesome viands as are wanted to re cruit these perishing tabernacles of dust, drink no wine, and you are all right' The result of Sophy's theories was that Caleb sat down valorously in his shooting-jacket to bear his"], [235, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 223 aunt company, and Rachel did not know whether his obliging conformity increased or lessened the breach of decorum. She was only sensible that it was an additional painful disturbance to the equa nimity of Webster the butler. Rachel could not have imagined in past days that she would ever arrive at minding breaches of decorum. Yet the impeachment was true, and she felt responsible for them though she had dressed punctiliously in her usual grey evening dress. She became in conse quence the butt of her sister Sophy's not par ticularly well-bred, but perfectly good-natured, open raillery. ' What a fine lady we have grown ! What would father and mother, and the boys and Patty, and Bella and Selina have thought of it ? What would Aunt Sukey have said ? Oh ! Rachel, you remember Aunt Sukey with her mittens and pattens, and her notion that she represented the sect of the Rechabites, and that father was a repro bate because he had degenerated into the ministry of the Church of England.' Rachel tried hard to be equally good-natured. ' I remember Aunt Sukey very well, and I should have told her, if she had been here, as I tell you, that a change of dress in the evening is refreshing and gets indispensable when one is used to it.' ' Ah, then it is the growing used to it which is the folly. How on earth did you get used to it, child?' The question was put in entire good faith, so"], [236, "224 RACHEL LANGTON that it was impossible to resent it. Rachel had sunk into a child, a spoilt child in Sophy's eyes. There was no blinking the fact ; nevertheless, it was a little trying to a woman like Rachel, forty-six years of age, the mistress of the house, to be addressed as ' child ' before her grown-up son and her servants, by her guest, a sister ten years her junior. During the evening, and for two or three days, Rachel was distracted from listening to those heroic adventures, which, to Sophy, were every day incidents, by the speculation whether she, Rachel, could have been like Sophy when the elder sister came first to Langton Hall \u2014 whether she had really advanced or retrogated into an arti ficial fine lady? She could remember when she, too, had thought dressing for dinner worse than an unmitigated bore, when she had held tenaciously by her widow's weeds as a means of saving her from the frivolous necessity. She, too, had over looked the beautiful oriel window in the drawing room, of which all the real Langtons were proud, which in later years she had occasionally exhibited with considerable satisfaction to distinguished architects and antiquarians. She, too, might have thought the yew-tree walk ' a dark hole,' though she had been less plain-spoken in expressing her opinion. What a thorn in the flesh she must have been to the Langtons, while all the time she had intended to do her duty by them as well as by"], [237, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 225 Caleb, and she was not, had never been, the sworn servant of the miserable, as Sophy was. She had not possessed the same excuse, she ought not to dis parage Sophy. Here was a high and sacred office, and it was clear that she filled it with honour. But how was she able to make it hers and to continue to hold it ? On whom and on what did she live? Her wants were few and simple, but still they were there to be supplied. They could not be altogether denied and overlooked. The Greens had inherited no money \u2014 it was hardly necessary to recall that \u2014 and what they earned, so far as Rachel knew, had not been more than enough for the day on which they earned it. How could Sophy afford to give herself up to the wel fare of the race ? She readily admitted that she worked for her living at intervals 'like Paul the tentmaker.' She acknowledged still more frankly when Rachel glanced at Sophy's hands, with the points of the fingers and the filbert-shaped nails broadened, flattened and wasted, and the whole hands hardened and roughened, that she lent her hands to those whom they could help. Rachel could not expect her sister to take up her abode in houses where the women as well as the men were field-labourers, factory hands, smallest shop keepers, hawkers and so forth, and not work with them. Since other work required training for the most part, Sophy did her part by replacing the house mother, or by acting in concert with her as char- p"], [238, "226 RACHEL LANGTON woman, washerwoman, cook and nurse to the establishment. Sophy never came nearer to ex plaining her particular calling, or the source of her modest supplies. With light dexterity and a spice of mischief she evaded farther explanation. Another slight flaw in Sophy's nobility and sincerity was patent. She had a child's taste for mystery, and in her desire to magnify her office she was fond of implying a great organisation with innumerable ramifications of which she was a will ing instrument She called herself ' a delegate of the people,' ' a female tribune,' supposing the great old Romans had been wise enough to have women among their tribunes. If she was a paid delegate or tribune she did not say so, though the labourer was worthy of his hire. She would not tell whether she belonged to any society, she would not give its watchword. She disdained to dwell on ways and means which had reference to herself, and to do her justice, she proclaimed her individual experi ence with telling simplicity and without a particle of exaggeration. But her tone changed when she talked of her party in a vague, exalted strain \u2014 as if it could command armies of adherents and funds by the million. It was impossible to think of Sophy save as a thoroughly honest, noble-minded woman, but it was evident that in spite of her intellect far beyond the average, in spite of, or because of her large heart, she was carried away and blinded by her enthusiasm."], [239, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 227 Rachel began to dread lest Sophy should fall a prey, especially when on some of her dangerous foreign missions to hare-brained or debauched advocates of liberty, equality and fraternity, to ad vanced philanthropists of a very different type from her own. What was to be done with Sophy Green at Langton Hall ? She was not there to be amused, not there merely to renew old kindred ties, sadly relaxed and out of joint. She was there to work in some fashion, there could be no doubt of that. And however moving her facts and appalling her figures, it would be awkward, to say the least, if she tried proselytising among a set of excellent and well-bred squires, possessed with a great idea of their own dignity and importance, as bigoted as any delegate of the people was fanatical, and among the most rooted old Tories left in the kingdom. The difficulties of the position were increased when Sophy's presence at the Hall became known in the neighbourhood. It was an old-fashioned neighbourhood, and one of the obligations which it retained was of 'showing attention,' in its phrase ology, to any friend's friend, any visitor who alighted for a few day or weeks in any household within the charmed circle. It was a duty in cumbent on all to do their best to render the stranger's stay in that corner of the country pleasant and profitable. Having accepted Mrs"], [240, "228 RACHEL LANGTON Langton long years before, the worthy gentry of the district agreed to frank Mrs Langton's sister before they had seen her face, or done more than heard her name. Little notes and cards of invitation poured in on the Hall, inviting the family, with special mention of Mrs Langton's sister, to festivals \u2014 picnics, musical evenings, etc., improvised in her honour. The writers of the notes generally ended by expressing their regret because they had not yet made Miss Green's acquaintance, and by announcing their intention of doing themselves the honour of paying their respects to her very soon. When these epistolary compliments were shown to Sophy, she read and tossed them aside with a laugh. ' Not I, what should I do among such idle people ? I have no taste for picnics ; I do not know a note of civilised music. The only songs I can sing are the \" Marseillaise,\" and the \" Shan van voh.\" \" Make my excuses,\" do you say ? I never make excuses. Say I can't and won't come, and that's enough. But don't let me keep you and Caleb at home. I shall find plenty to do. I have a number of addresses to write out. I want to visit the county gaol, workhouse and asylum, and see for myself what state they are in. I suppose Caleb can get me orders to go over them. It is an abuse of the position that orders should be required, but while Rome exists we must do as the"], [241, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 229 Romans do. I have an idea of stumping the county between this and Westbridge and sowing our tracts by the way. So don't let me interfere with your engagements, Rachel. Go and play the squiress to your heart's content.' In one sense Sophy's explicit refusal was a relief. How could Rachel introduce a social fire brand into those unsuspecting, decorous houses ? A Louise Michel was in the eyes of their occupants an object of horror. Mrs Langton could not have answered to her conscience for betraying the trust reposed in her by her neighbours, granting she had been so left to herself as to impose upon them, under false pretences, an English ' Louise Michel.' But to talk of her, Rachel, playing the squiress to her heart's content ! Sophy meant no harm, but the phrase had bitter irony in it for Rachel. It recalled to her, with a more vivid perception than she had entertained for many a day, how little she had in common with many of her neighbours. She lived over again in a few seconds the long, dull dinners she had sat out, the receptions she had not been able to escape, the nicely measured and mannered merry-makings which had sounded to her like refined versions of the proverbial crackling of thorns under a pot. She had done it for Caleb's sake; that he might not find himself when he grew up a stranger in the circle to which he belonged, in which he must eventually move. But how often she had longed with a sick longing for the Spartan"], [242, "RACHEL LANGTON 230 freedom and independence, ay, even the Spartan bareness of her little Stage in Mittesheim. There she had enjoyed occasional dips into the profes sional society of the town, where the women cooked and stitched, and did not dream of being anything save good house-mothers, and the men \u2014 those abstruse, abstracted, smoking philosophers \u2014 held high converse on every sub ject under the sun. At the same time, they did not object to admit a woman, provided she was a stranger and not one of their own practical, matter-of-fact partners, to the communion of souls. In Germany Rachel had eaten early dinners of herbs with homely philosophers and their Xan tippes. In the country houses of England she was tempted to say she had shared late repasts of stalled oxen with sets of polished gamekeepers and their equally polished, equally empty-headed spouses. Agatha Etheredge, with the kindest purpose, hurried over to the Hall the moment she heard the bare fact that Rachel had a sister with her at last. When Mrs Etheredge was in the same room with the sister the visitor stared in blank amazement. This was not a woman of her kind, this was not like any woman she had ever known, which was not surprising, seeing that the two bore not the slightest affinity to each other, and one does not expect a bird of paradise to have even a bowing acquaintance with an eagle. A terrible vision crossed Agatha's mind of an upheaval of the solid founda-"], [243, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 231 tions of society \u2014 a revolution. She knew that there were people in her rank, cultured, intellectual people, who in their searchings into political economy, their studies of the histories and laws of nations, actually believed that such a calamity was coming. She was not sure that her own husband was not one of them. She was aware also that there were great ladies who would lightly discuss democracy in theory, and play with it, speaking of their ' dear mob,' their 'beloved ragamuffins' (a word which stood for sans culottes), those ' charming successors of Oliver Cromwell and Maximilian Robespierre. But she shrank back from the contemplation, not to say the contact. In her agitation and dismay at being suddenly brought face to face with a politi cal woman of the most pronounced description \u2014 not a Princess Lieven, not a Madame de Stael, but a member of forbidden clubs, an inflamed and inflaming speaker at incendiary meetings, a Madame White, a Louise Michel, a possible Charlotte Corday if she got the opportunity \u2014 poor Agatha began to talk fast to Mrs Langton on indifferent topics. And the topic she chose at random was the worry she had gone through in connection with a young waiting-maid who had not answered her mistress's expectations. Then Sophy broke in on the conversation with ruthlessness, a twinkle in her eye lending point to a mocking inflection of her loud and slightly hoarse voice \u2014 her one physical defect : ' Oh, the"], [244, "232 RACHEL LANGTON old servant nuisance \u2014 \" the greatest plague in life.\" Is that not done to death by this time ? I wonder when people will be wise enough to dis cover that its only cure is to do away with servants and serve themselves.' Agatha simply fled before the suggestion. She had never been unjust or unfeeling to a servant in the whole course of her gentle life, but she had never so much as conceived of a state of earthly existence in which she was not to be waited upon with deference, and to dispense favours graciously. She did more than flee back to her well-trained household at Ryelands. For the first time in her annual visits to the old neighbourhood she made a break in her stay. She decided on an interval of sea-bathing at Ryde for herself and the children, which might last for a week or two, or for the re mainder of the holidays, acccording to circum stances. ' I could not stay, dearest,' Agatha wrote to her faithful yet half-amused husband. ' I was forced to go till that dreadful, beautiful, uncanny sister of Rachel's had taken her departure. Oh, how thankful we ought to be that Rachel is not such another. We never knew till now what we were saved from. She, the sister, might be a Cassandra or an Helen Macgregor,' wrote poor Agatha, at a loss, and stumbling wildly for a simile, ' only she does not look as if she were cursed either with melancholy or ferocity. She was quite"], [245, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 233 cool and composed ; she even laughed, but her talk was subversive of all authority. I would not have Charlie or Bertie or Adela hear her for the whole world. It might unsettle their minds and shake their nerves for the rest of their lives.' Mrs Arthur had needed none of the Rector's arguments to induce her to go with him to the Hall to pay a courtesy visit to Mrs Langton's sister. She must be ' a guy,' and Mrs Arthur felt as if she were entitled to the full benefit of the stranger's gaucheries. Eleanor would take accurate stock of them, and reproduce the worst for future satirical illus tration of her opinion of Mrs Langton and her friends. But the biter was bitten with a vengeance. Mrs Arthur had not the unerring discrimina tion of Mrs Etheredge. At a first glance the Rector's wife was merely taken aback and driven out of her bearings. ' To what class of type did this woman belong ? She sat there long after luncheon in her housemaid's wrapper, and having barely acknowledged Mrs Langton's brief intro duction, went on writing with practised rapidity sheaves of \" papers,\" and scattering them all around her without ceremony, How had her battered looking shop-desk found its way into the Hall drawing-room, as if the place belonged to her ? Was she a board schoolmistress out on a holiday, or a female clerk who makes up tradesmen's books"], [246, "234 RACHEL LANGTON behind a railing over a counter? Surely her audacity went beyond all bounds.' Mrs Arthur had not thought of anybody so ' low ' among Mrs Langton's connections. This was a worse and more unmanageable person than the moqueuse had anticipated. She did not see how she could draw such a woman out and laugh at her. Mrs Arthur was almost moved to pity Mrs Langton. Caleb was present, and his aunt turned and prepared to confine her conversation to him. ' Don't you take an interest in cub-hunting, Caleb ? ' she asked, in the innocence of her heart. ' There were some fine cubs over at Moleswark on Wednesday ; I thought you would have been there.' At that 'the woman' looked up with the speed of lightning, though nobody had addressed her, and took the word out of Caleb's mouth, as if she were accepting a challenge. ' Cub-hunting? Is that a form of fox-hunting ? I hope it is a less brutal sport.' ' Brutal ! ' repeated Mrs Arthur, in a high key, with round eyes, as if she had never heard the word before and could not make out its meaning. 'Yes, brutal,' said Sophy, with deliberate em phasis ; ' I have travelled a good deal in my day, and I can assure you that fox-hunting, though the practice has been exported, and is followed to some extent in certain foreign circles, like most bad fashions, is too brutal and senseless a past-"], [247, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 235 time to be indigenous to any other soil than this of ours.' The bomb-shell had fallen and burst, and the effect was so sudden and scathing that Caleb could have laughed as he had not felt inclined to laugh for weeks. But he could not allow his Aunt Eleanor to be insulted in his house. His Aunt Sophy did not realise the deadly insult she had inflicted. ' Oh ! I say, Aunt Sophy,' he tackled his formid able adversary, ' don't annihilate us. Don't be quite so utilitarian or humanitarian \u2014 which is it? As to the humanitarianism some people maintain the fox likes it Anyhow, we are all fox-hunters here, with the exception of the mater and you. The Rector, there, finds time sometimes to show that his riding, if he will let me mention it, does no discredit to the cloth to which Jack Russell belonged. As for my Aunt Eleanor, let me tell you that her sovereignty as queen of the chase is undisputed in her native county. In the character of her admiring nephew, I should feel myself bound to call out any fellow who doubted it.' ' I am sorry to hear it.' said the unabashed Sophy, without the ghost of an apology. ' Fox hunting is foolish enough in a lad of your class who has never turned his attention to any serious pursuit, who has been accustomed to hear horses and horsemanship treated as if they were matters of the first importance, for which men might sell"], [248, "236 RACHEL LANGTON their souls without any disproportion in the bar gain. But for a clergyman and a woman to see no objection to the barbarous, debasing amuse ment passes my comprehension, though I am aware the case is not exceptional.' Mrs Arthur still lived, but she was speechless. A little later Sophy contrived to entangle the Rev. Arthur in a discussion on the Poor Laws, and to demonstrate in a trice that she knew ten times more about them than he did. When the first shock of her superiority was past he forgave her. Poor Arthur had always been pacific and forgiv ing. However, he was not disinclined to endorse his wife's opinion when she pressed her horse close to his \u2014 the couple had ' taken the Hall ' at the end of an afternoon's ride \u2014 and said in a voice of such deep warning that it was well-nigh sepul chral, and totally unlike her ordinary treble tones, ' That woman is dangerous, take my word for it, Arthur.' In his heart he agreed with her, but he felt called upon to assert his masculine superiority by pooh-poohing her alarm. ' She is a Chartist,' declared Mrs Arthur, solemnly, very much as she would have cried, ' She is a murderess.' ' No, no, Chartists are out of date.' He corrected the anachronism. ' Then she is a Communist or a Nihilist,' insisted Mrs Arthur."], [249, "SOPHY AT CLOSER QUARTERS 237 ' Nonsense, my dear, there are no Communists in England, at least, none to speak of, and I don't know that Nihilism is of much moment out of Russia. Miss Green is only a very advanced young woman \u2014 when I say young, I don't mean in her first youth, of course \u2014 a very fine woman, nevertheless, who chooses to brandish the last democratic fad which has come out.' But the Rector's confidence in the stability of the most venerable of institutions had received a blow."], [250, "238 CHAPTER X A YOUNG REFORMER \u2014 THE USURPATION OF THE RECTOR'S SCHOOLROOM In spite of Caleb's gallant defence of his Aunt Eleanor's sportswomanship, he was at that moment on the brink of becoming a convert to his Aunt Sophy's socialism. In a few days more he was over the brink and had plunged into its most eddy ing whirlpool. Smarting as he was under his first sense of loss, which he attributed in a great measure to the length and breadth of social and sectarian prejudices, he was very much in the humour to make an attack on society, and sects in general, as they are at present constituted. It added an additional zest to his humour that, as Squire of Langton Hall, he would have a good deal to relinquish, and a whole world of his own to turn topsy-turvy if he became an out and out follower of the old school of Owen and the new school of Lawrence Oliphant. He was not quite sure how it was to be done \u2014 whether he was to cut up his estate into allotments and present each to a day labourer ; or whether he was to transform the Hall into a new Blythesdale settlement ; or whether"], [251, "A YOUNG REFORMER 239 the mother and himself should live on an equality with Webster, the butler, and Robins, the cook \u2014 that is, if Mr Webster and Mrs Robins would con sent to live in their turn on a level with the stable boy and the scullery-girl. It was a more fascinat ing project that he should start forthwith for the East, to be inducted into the mystic creeds which were to replace or supplement Christianity. But to do Caleb justice, his most compel ling motives were not a youthful craving for change and excitement, and a subtle desire to re venge himself on conventionality and austerity in the persons of those members of his kindred to whom he had hitherto deferred, and on the un womanly absorption in her art and unfeeling dis regard to his despair which Essex Etheredge had displayed. He was stirred to his heart's core by Sophy Green's tales. His brain was inflamed by her natural rhetoric. He was magnetised by her singular force of character, and enthralled by her disinterestedness and devotion. When she said to him, ' Don't call me Aunt Sophy, it is a babyish name which you have not even been accustomed to use. Let us be \" Caleb \" and \" Sophy \" to each other. I think I have found a comrade in you, and we'll fight shoulder to shoulder in the great war against criminal injustice and old besotted blindness and thraldom of spirit,' he responded readily. The good fellowship of the speech, the frank"], [252, "240 RACHEL LANGTON recognition of the dignity and responsibility of his manhood by a woman nearly old enough to be his mother, the hearty willingness to take him as her friend and ally, irrespective of the fact that she had laboured and suffered long years in a cause for which he had necessarily done nothing, of which he was as one may say the natural enemy, broke down the last of the hot-headed young fellow's doubts and scruples. He took the pledge, he grasped the shapely, capable hand held out to him, realising, as he did so, that it was not white and soft as his Aunt Agatha's, as even his mother's. It had grown hardened and lined in its willingness to undertake any work, the meanest, the most servile, the most repulsive, to help the weak and oppressed. He was prepared to follow his inspiriting leader through fire and water. Caleb and Sophy started on their crusade for the rights of Labour by getting up meetings in favour of co-operation in Westbridge, and by canvassing Caleb's tenants and workpeople, while they were yet his satellites, to join unions and uphold strikes. The disturbers of the public peace and assailants of the constitution carried on their machinations with engaging openness ; but that corner of the country was still quite uneducated so far as Radical theories were concerned. It was Sophy's boast, as it was that of Sydney Smith on another tack, that she could sympathise and enter into interesting discussion with any man. She was able to frater-"], [253, "A YOUNG REFORMER 241 nise with all, so, far from despising the tillers of the soil and holding them as dull as the clods they cultivated, she numbered large bodies of peasants among her steadfast adherents. But that was out of England for the most part. In her own country her disciples were largely drawn from the sharp witted \u2014 though often shallow in their sharp-witted ness \u2014 thoughtful, factious and sceptical ranks of the mechanics and artisans of the great cities. So dense-minded were the natives of all degrees round the centre of operation of these two insurg ents, that, for a space, the import of their pro ceedings was not taken in. They were either over looked as something totally beyond the ken and comprehension of the usual magnates of the dis trict, or they were puzzled over as a kind of incom prehensible jest, stupid and in baddish taste, which would, however, explain itself presently. Rachel was left out of the swim, standing stranded on the shore, looking on at the question able proceedings of her sister and son, uncon vinced, dissatisfied, but neither so startled nor so shocked as another woman might have been. These proceedings might be rash, reckless, unor thodox, but they were not essentially immoral or irreligious, and that meant everything to Rachel. The independent attitude which she was disposed to claim for herself and her neighbour, her re served temper which had grown cautious with years, the very charity she had learned in her progress Q"], [254, "242 RACHEL LANGTON through life, together with a certain diffidence which had been developed in her, kept her from interfering.

It will settle the questiou for itself, either by success or failure. The promoters will learn the truth by the sequel ; they will not be taught it by compulsion and against the grain,' Mrs Langton said to herself, reminding herself that she had always wished that Caleb might be a teacher and reformer in his generation, though not exactly in this wholesale political fashion. It gave Rachel pain to see how more than resigned her son was to her being left entirely out of the movement which had taken possession of him, which was now monopolising him. She supposed that mothers must get accustomed to seeing themselves superseded, and she guessed that her son had not forgiven her for the share he sup posed she had taken in his rejection by Essex Etheredge. Rachel was not equally quick in com prehending that Caleb did not choose that she should be implicated in the blame which he, at least, was well aware he must incur from his former friends.

Her stay at Langton could not be protracted many days longer. She announced decisively that, poor single woman as she was, she was wanted all over the kingdom and beyond the kingdom. What had to be done must be done quickly. The bills announcing the lecture ' be hoved ' to be written post-haste, by the principal performers, instead of being sent to be printed at Westbridge. ' Where shall we bid the people come, Caleb ? ' asked Sophy, pausing with uplifted pen as the two sat writing, one at each side of the library table. They were like a pair of attorney's clerks ; at the same time, in the middle of their supreme earnest ness, they were not above running races in their inky work, like a couple of children, as few attor ney's clerks are prompted to do. ' Tell me quick, Caleb,' she adjured him, ' or you will be taking a base advantage. Twenty, thirty, forty, I am still well in advance of you. I may allow myself one observation.

' I always leave that to be put in at the last in case of changes, but it is time it was fixed. We cannot have a monster meeting, I am afraid, but I suppose we may count on more listeners than your dining - room would hold. Besides, the housemaids would be sure to complain of the dust or mud carried in by the company, and your mother might not like me to rise early and sweep or scrub the floor. Have you no old ball room which we could honour for all time by making use of it as the scene of a popular assembly ? ' ' We have no ballroom. I cannot tell why the Langtons have done without one up to the present date. I believe my Aunt Agatha was in the habit of lamenting the deficiency. I conclude, in future, we'll dance on the green \u2014 that is, if we dance at all,' said Caleb, rather flippantly. ' I have seen dancing I liked,' confessed Sophy. ' That was when all the people joined hands and capered in an ecstasy down the street together, or swung round and round in their native rondes on a French fete day.

Didn't I hear someone say something of a trumpery attempt at theatricals or recitations which you had in the schoolroom here lately ? Cannot the schoolroom be made available ? ' Caleb had winced manifestly. ' Of course there is the schoolroom,' he said, quickly, ' a couple of them for that matter, since both the boys and girls of the parish are accom modated, but they don't belong to a board. Uncle Arthur has made the required compromise, and secured the Government grant, while he retains the school \u2014 subject to the visits of the inspectors.' ' Then there is a place ready made for us ? ' said Sophy, dashing in a word with her pen. Rachel had come into the room, and was stand ing by the farther window listening to the talk of the two. She had been very much a listener and looker-on during these last weeks. It seemed as if the time when she had taken an active part in her son's affairs was come to an end. She felt shelved already, and old before her time. But she must speak at the moment, and prevent a trespass on the rights of others. 'Caleb, I don't think you should try to get the schoolroom \u2014 I do not see how you can.

' Sophy, I wish you would remember that our father was a clergyman when you disparage his office,' remonstrated Rachel, more indignantly than reasonably. ' My good woman,' asserted Sophy, with a cool, dispassionate way of looking at things, ' I have not forgotten our father \u2014 excellent, hard-working, old soul ! \u2014 who was yet not held worthy of his hire by his church.

But this is wandering far from our sheep, Caleb. You are the lord of the manor, against your conscience, I hope; still, the law as it stands, says so, and what the law gives you I trust you mean to take for the sake of the people. Caleb Langton did not quite like the position. But this he knew, that whatever the law might or might not give him, a word from him, the Squire and the Rector's nephew, when there was nobody to dispute his claim, would command the use or abuse of the schoolroom for one night. He could not fail Sophy at the first tug-of-war, leaving her under the impression that, after all, he was half-hearted in the cause, a mere noodle under his mother's thumb, in leading-strings to the Rector, unable to make the small sacrifice for freedom and humanity of risking his uncle's dis pleasure. He was in a mood, where his mother was concerned, of catching at the chance of show ing her that, though he had been thwarted in his desire, he was, nevertheless, master at Langton Hall. He could teach some of his kindred that"], [260, "248 RACHEL LANGTON it might have been better for them to have de scended a step from their social and moral height and to have exerted themselves to promote the object \u2014 to wit, his marriage with Essex Ether edge, on which he had set his heart, though he was doing his best to persuade himself that he had now ceased to covet it. For what was a man's private and personal happiness or misery compared to the tremendous stake involved in the welfare of the nations ? Caleb got the promise of the schoolroom for the following night, and appeared to listen stolidly to his mother's grave disclaimer. ' I think that Sophy and you are taking a most unwarrantable liberty in the Rector's absence. However guarded and inoffensive your words may be, which I crave leave to doubt, I cannot even seem to agree with what you are doing, little as my support matters. ' Then stay away from the lecture, mother ; nobody is asking you to put force upon yourself,' Caleb told her suavely. Sophy added smiling, that she, Rachel, was falling behind the rest of the world and losing touch with her time. Or else she had not the courage of her opinions. Probably there was a worse explanation. She was infected with the traditions of her position, and was fast degenerating into an old - fashioned, estimable, obstinate, peddling liege-lady, who held conspira tors far too dangerous persons to be tampered"], [261, "A YOUNG REFORMER 249 with. Where was the fiery spirit of her youth? Where her revolt against red-tapeism ? An ambiguous word to the obliging school master, who opened his eyes considerably, while he was too cautious to do anything else than offer an excuse for being absent from the meeting, did something. Still more was done by a lordly exercise of these very prerogatives as squire and landlord, which were about to be assailed. In short, Caleb accomplished a tour de force, of which he was heartily ashamed even in the heat of the excitement, and obtained possession of the school room for the couple of hours that would suffice for the promulgation of his and Sophy's gospel. The weather was as favourable as it had been on the day, which had begun to look far off, of the garden play at Ryelands. But in spite of the fine autumn night, with the moon almost at the full, the audience of workpeople was mediocre, and there was not a single member of any other class drawn either by curiosity or by a resolution to be on the spot to contradict the agitators. It was no matter that the college bred young squire was in the chair, which he took without waiting for the formality of being voted into it.

What should she be able to tell them of questions which belonged to themselves ? Such of the men as were householders held votes, but no women, be she the wife of the greatest nobleman in the county or a rich heiress on her own account, was suffered to have a voice in the election of their members of Parliament. Why, then, should a woman come to them and lecture them on what was none of her concern \u2014 about which she could know naught? It did not matter that she was a stunner for size and comeli ness.

Women might argufy on the bringing up of children and the like, though even then they were told to speak at home and listen to their husbands who knew better, but on work and wages, dang it ! that was bosh! It did not help Sophy much that she was the Squire's mother's sister. Mrs Langton was a woman calculated to be more respected than loved by her dependants.

Instead of being an advantage to the lecturer, it was against her that Essex Etheredge had spoken to a similar company in that schoolroom not long before. The pretty, fresh, young, play-acting miss had all the gentry rallying round her, more by token she was one of themselves. She had just told stories \u2014 rare good ones, too \u2014 better than those which some of her listeners could remember to have heard at the penny readings in vogue five and-twenty years before, and she had repeated poems without ever forgetting a word. She had only asked them to laugh or to cry, as they were ready to do at her bidding. She had not thrust herself into their proper business, and sought to draw them into a league against the farmers and squires, little knowing the consequences.

But her hair was twisted round her head as plain as the critics' missuses (whose hands were full) did their braids after the wives and mothers had given up their girlish fringes.

She might be said to have only two fairly appreciative listeners in addition to her nephew and chairman. The two were a couple of men who made themselves conspicuous from the begin- ning. They had ranged themselves while still out- side, one on each side of the schoolroom door. When the lecturer and her guarantee appeared, the men had advanced and shaken with effusion the doubtful, reluctant hand of Caleb and the readily - outstretched, well - accustomed hand of Sophy. They took front seats, near Soph}-, while they cried ' hear, hear,' the one in a hys terical, the other in a falsetto voice, and stamped vociferous applause with their heavy boots all through the performance, disturbing the per former, who at the same time bore the trial philosophically as a thing of course."], [266, "254 RACHEL LANGTON Cabel knew both of these men by sight and hearsay. The one was the idle, able-bodied typical demagogue of the unprincipled genus, who never did an honest day's work if he could help it, but stumped the country, and throve and grew fat on the credulous esprit de corps of his fellows. The other was a poor little fellow, who one hard winter could get nothing to do, with all the will in the world and the most frantic efforts to find work. During the bitter time he saw his wife and two children die of starvation fever. After that climax he never cared to work again, but went about from place to place with his white, pinched face and hollow eyes full of lambent light, seeking to redress for others that primary wrong of ' no work and no bread ' which had cost him dear. Nobody could doubt his sincerity, but many people, in the face of his feverish cleverness, questioned his entire sanity. Caleb could not resist asking himself what strange chance had brought him for comrades \u2014 not only Sophy, the beautiful and indomit able \u2014 but such men as Will Bannister and Ned Fairlie. Caleb and Sophy could stand the dispiriting effect of the scanty audience, full of apathy, tinged with scorn, except in the case of the two claqueurs. The bare schoolroom \u2014 only dimly lit in the autumn dusk, seeing that the woman in charge chose this method of showing her resentment at the addi-"], [267, "' THE BLOOD OF A MURDERED MAN ' 255 tional trouble imposed upon her, and of express ing her hazy conviction that the young Squire was up to some mischief in the Rector's absence \u2014 did not intimidate the leaders. For they held some thing in reserve, something startling, which would move these dull souls. There was a mine about to be sprung, with which not even Rachel was ac quainted, though she had heard her son and her sister speaking with lively anger and vehement disapproval of a paragraph in the day's county newspaper. It was the record of the severe sen tence which had been passed by a couple of neigh bouring justices on a juvenile offender against the game laws. Caleb was a keen enough sportsman, but under his recent conversion he was a still keener socialist. Whatever lurking sympathy he might have felt with the justices was overcome by a stronger influence. He went the whole length with Sophy in her passionate animadver sions against the transparent injustice of setting two men, who were landed proprietors, zealous preservers of game and enthusiastic sportsmen, to judge a boy of sixteen, whose temptation had lain in the circumstance that he had shared the tastes of his betters and exercised them with greater audacity than discretion, or than the strictest honesty perhaps. The result had been that the justices had sent the lad to prison to await the quarter sessions, thus robbing him of his char acter, which was all his worldly wealth. And"], [268, "256 RACHEL LANGTON this was simply because he had felt an irre sistible impulse to lift up his hand against those wild creatures of the fields and woods, which, ac cording to Sophy, ought to be no man's property. For game (with certain limitations, if people would have it so, that it might not be exterminated) should belong to the people of the country which bred it. The aunt and nephew had talked themselves into a white heat of wrath at what they called the arrogant outrage, and had determined in their own high-handed fashion to avenge it. Caleb was to be the principal actor in this half of the programme. In place of being deterred from playing his magnanimous part by lack of encouragement, he felt an irresistible hankering to commit himself irretrievably. He was also fain to try if anything he could say or do would stir these yokels, as they had answered to the touches of human nature which Essex Etheredge had brought home to them. With her light fingers, inspired by her great gift, she had swept the tough and rusty strings of their hearts, and brought strange music from them. Sophy wound up her well-prepared, ill-received speech without betraying a particle of the mortifi cation which she was above feeling. Then Caleb rose and spoke with less difficulty than he had occasionally experienced in addressing the Union, for he had burnt his ships and cast in his lot with"], [269, "' THE BLOOD OF A MURDERED MAN ' 257 Sophy and her cause. He began somewhat in set form, with the hope that those present would agree with him in thanking his friend and kinswoman (he wondered, as he spoke, if she would dislike him to bring forward their relationship) for the admirable address she had given them on a subject which, he could tell them she had studied deeply, that must come home to them all. Now he must have his innings. They had probably heard of the painful incident which had occurred the day before at High Werecliffe. A young lad \u2014 Tom Miles by name \u2014 (some of those listening to Caleb were pro bably acquainted with him and his family) had been charged with the unpardonable crime, in a lad of his age, of snaring a hare, for which he had been sent to Westbridge Jail until he should undergo a further trial. In the meantime, he was associated, in the popular mind, at least, with cut - throats, thieves and drunken brawlers, to come out at the end of his shorter or longer term of imprisonment branded as a jail-bird for the rest of his days. Did they know what that stamp meant? Were they content to suffer it to rest on one of themselves, on such insufficient grounds, without making a protest against the monstrous tyranny ? Caleb had taken his plunge, and, undoubtedly, he had roused his audience. At the mention of Tom Miles there was a kind of rustle among the mole skin jackets and woollen shawls. The men and R"], [270, "258 RACHEL LANGTON the two or three women who were present looked intelligently at each other. Of course they knew about Tom Miles and the misfortune which had befallen him ' along of Squire Leigh ' the day be fore. Some of them had boys of their own who might provoke a similar fate, others had narrowly escaped it in their own persons in their young days. Every man and woman there ceased to be drowsy, supercilious or sardonic, and was wide awake, on the qui vive, to hear what the young Squire was going to say about Tom Miles. Caleb was not going to say much more, directly about the now notorious Tom, with fame or in famy thus early thrust upon him, but was going to say a good deal indirectly. Caleb told the wondering assembly of the origin of the Game Laws in the Forest Laws. These had not existed in the days of the native Saxon Kings, when the woods and the wolds, the meres and the rivers, with their wild creatures, had been free. The Forest Laws were instituted by the invading Norman Kings for their selfish grati fication, and the laws had nearly cost the makers their crowns, for Englishmen would love open-air sport to the end of time. He craved the indulgence of the lecturer for the assertion (with a meaning glance at Sophy). At least, he was sure she would agree with him when he added that what was the inheritance of the many ought not to be appropri-"], [271, "THE BLOOD OF A MURDERED MAN ' 259 ated by the few for their class diversion. Sophy was ready with her cordial Hear ! Hear ! Caleb went on to tell of the misdemeanour of a certain Will Shakespeare \u2014 and as the speaker made his reference he could not avoid questioning himself idly if any who heard him recognised the immortal name, and linked it with the histories of Portia and Shylock, Princess Constance, little Arthur and King John, Lear and Cordelia? But Caleb was not bringing forward Shakespeare in order to indulge in a vain speculation, it was to narrate how he had slain a deer without authority, and been had up before a justice of his day, one Lucy of Charlecote. He did not do much, that justice, save seek to browbeat the culprit who had found his revenge, many times in the three hundred years which had intervened, by holding up his judge as ' Justice Shallow ' to the undying ridicule of his own and succeeding generations. Critics had tried to prove that the tradition was not true, but it answered too well to the time, to the man and to the play in which he embalmed it, to have a false ring about it. Such of them as were scholars \u2014 Caleb was brought up sharply by a sense of the gross extravagance of the supposition the moment he had uttered the words (he might have excused himself to himself by the reminder that on a back bench sat a shop-boy from West bridge who was making the most of a half-holiday), but he preferred to improve upon the inference."], [272, "260 RACHEL LANGTON He meant such of them as in these days when the schoolmaster was abroad had children better taught than their fathers, ought to set them to read aloud the passage which had to do with the killing of the deer and the pomposity of Justice Shallow. Caleb offered to read to the company, making his offer shamefacedly and humbly, because the blood in his veins was tingling with the recollec tion of another reader whose peaceful achieve ments, undertaken with a different end in view, he could never hope to emulate. What he desired to read was not a passage from Shakespeare but a song on the vexed subject of poaching. It was written by a clergyman who was a good friend to working men, though his sponsor felt bound to confess that the writer of the song had swerved somewhat in his later years from the faith of his earlier manhood which had won for him the hon ourable title of ' The Christian Socialist.' Caleb would leave his hearers to discover for themselves the burning eloquence of the ' Song of the Poacher s Wife! The words were supposed to be spoken after she had been made a widow, when she had stolen out at nightfall to gaze, with wild eyes, on the patch of clover which, to her distempered brain, was red with the ' blood of a murdered man.' Caleb in his youthful exaltation read, not only without faltering, but with a thrill of sympathy in"], [273, "' THE BLOOD OF A MURDERED MAN ' 261 his voice, the fiery anathema, every word of which hisses its curse. It had really no personal application to begin with. He was certainly not aware that Squire Leigh of High Werecliffe was casting his daughters' bread ' to hounds and to liveried varlets' while to Caleb's knowledge his own grandfather had been unusually careful, so far as his means would let him, of the cottages on his land. It could not be said of him with any approach to truth that his labourers were ' Worse housed than his hounds and his hunters, Worse fed than his hogs and his sheep! It was only when the reader came to the lines which describe the squire's son of the song : \u2014 ' His youngest, the mealy-mouthed rector,' speaking peace by the carefully-tended death-bed where no peace should have been spoken, that the reader felt his tongue all at once begin to cleave to the roof of his mouth and his face to flush. What was he saying ? These villagers would think only of one Rector, and it was in that Rector's parish schoolroom that his nephew was presenting to the parishioners this disgraceful travesty of their parson. At the same moment Caleb's memory took a swift flight backwards, and brought vividly before him the fondly-loved \" nunks \" of the libeller's"], [274, "262 RACHEL LANGTON childhood. In those lisping days at Langton Hall the little boy had owed all his juvenile delights to the young man whose strong arms had carried the child, whose good-natured, cheery voice had intro duced him to the inhabitants of the stables and kennels. Uncle Arthur had turned up again at Mittesheim when he (Caleb) had solemnly pro mised that if mother would go home to Langton Hall he would try to take up the task which had been assigned to him \u2014 the task his uncle had said he was shirking. All through his youth up to the present time, his Uncle Arthur had been, next to Caleb's mother, his most constant, untiring friend. His Aunt Agatha, with her grace and sweetness, only rose above his horizon at intervals ; but his Uncle Arthur had always been there at Langton Rectory, always ready to befriend and encourage him, unless, in that last movement of Caleb's, when he had proposed to marry Essex Etheredge. However, all that was as nothing com pared to the fact that his uncle had asked Caleb a favour since the young man came of age. The Rector was floundering amidst money difficulties, in spite of the young Squire's act of justice or generosity on coming to his kingdom. These diffi culties, largely the result of Mrs Arthur's reckless ness and the poor Rector's easy-going nature, were infinitely harassing and humiliating to him as a clergyman. He had been driven, with knitted brows and bent head, to seek temporary accommo-"], [275, "' THE BLOOD OF A MURDERED MAN ' 263 dation from his nephew in connection with a bill which a creditor was pressing him to pay. The matter was a trifle to Caleb in the light of the ample, unencumbered estate on which \u2014 thanks to his mother, to the old family lawyer, Seacombe, and to this very kinsman who had all sedulously looked after the lad's interests \u2014 he had already entered. He would have quite willingly granted the request without thinking twice of it, if it had not been for the evident pain with which it was preferred and the fervent assurance by which it was followed : ' This shall never happen again, Caleb ; you may rest assured of that whatever may befall me.' In the sudden clearness with which he recalled this episode Caleb felt his colour go and the moisture of positive distress gather on his brow. In this light his present conduct struck him as positively dastardly, but there was no going back, and the anguish which had visited him with the consciousness of the manner in which he was repaying his life-long friend, only pushed him on to a more desperate step. Even Sophy might think he was going to stop there, but he knew better. He would compromise himself beyond recovery, punish himself as well as the Rector, whom he had been inadvertently satirising. He began to speak again, making an announcement in a high-pitched, excited voice, as if defying con tradiction. He said he wished to prove to his hearers, in the only manner in his power that he"], [276, "264 RACHEL LANGTON would have nothing to do with such robbery of the people's rights and with such persecution of those among them who asserted their title to wage war with the free creatures of the earth \u2014 the game, in fact, which ought to be nobody's ' stock,' just as the open sea and the wide air belonged to nobody. It had been the same originally with the woods, the moors and the fens, and they ought still to be left free to the people. In that case there would be better sport for everybody, than what was supplied by the wholesale slaughter-pens of battues of pheasants or droves of deer driven in for the delectation o the rich. It had been asserted that to make game free was impracticable, unless in a thinly inhabited country, because otherwise there would soon not be a hare or a partridge or a salmon trout left in the land for the benefit of any class. What of that if the question lay between extirpation and usurpation ? Besides, surely the people themselves could lay down laws, which they would be bound to keep, to prevent the entire destruction of game. Anyhow he was not going to stand out on such wire-drawn doubts and delicate scruples. From that night the preserves at Langton Hall, his covers and his reach of the river, would be as ree to his neighbours in the village and in the cottages round about, as to himself, with the single stipulation that they should do no injury to the woods and fields. These were clearly his, since his ancestors had bought them in some form, brought them under cultivation, planted"], [277, "' THE BLOOD OF A MURDERED MAN ' 265 tilled and built there for generations. The fruits of their labours were justly their descendants, so were the sheep and cattle which Langton after Langton had bred and reared. But no Tom Miles should be made a jail-bird by him for simply wiring a bird, or netting a fish. In fact, Tom would no longer need to wire or net his prey. As soon as he could save enough from his earnings for the purpose, he might have a gun or a rod like other lads of his years. He must also buy a game licence till the laws in that respect were changed, for the use of his gun, but he might ply his rod without paying a tax. Anyhow, he was at per fect liberty to shoot or fish over the Langton Hall estate. Sophy sprang to her feet, looking radiant, and clapped her hands joyfully. Here was a convert to her principles \u2014 a noble young fellow willing to pay the cost \u2014 her own flesh and blood, too, though she had professed that consideration to be of comparatively small account. But leaving Sophy's testimony out of the question, such boisterous applause as hailed the declaration proceeded from the two Socialists, Bannister and Fairlie. The rustics, pure and simple, gaped, scratched their heads and could not believe their ears, could not even thank their benefactor. Was the young Squire taking a rise out of them ? Was he clean off his head ? What would the Rector say when he came back ?"], [278, "266 RACHEL LANGTON One man was furious, and scarcely sought to hide his indignation.

They con gratulated themselves with unction on the impor tant measure Caleb had resorted to, which they insisted ought to serve as a precedent for many more just and generous measures of the same description.

You ought not to have set yourself up in direct opposition to the entire community in your own class. I know your Uncle Arthur and the Ether edges will be dreadfully vexed.' ' I hope I am to be permitted to speak and act for myself without constant reference to my father's brother and sister, or even to you, mother,' said Caleb, loftily. ' I do not see what is the good of coming to man's estate otherwise.' ' My impression is that you should be very glad that Caleb has got beyond the stage of leading strings,' said Sophy, nodding her head. ' It frees his friends, including me, from all responsibility on his behalf. I wish you would make a better breakfast, Rachel,' turning towards her hostess.

Rachel was very unhappy about what had oc curred \u2014 so unhappy that it was a relief to her to be left to herself by the impenitent transgressors going their different ways. Sophy was to leave the next morning. She had to shut herself up in the meantime to prepare for the rush of business which she expected in the large town for which she was bound. Caleb wandered out without giving any explana tion of his movements. There was a reaction from his state of mingled desperation and elation. He was irritably conscious of the whispers of ex cited, and for the most part disparaging, com ment with which his very servants were already pursuing him. Rachel was thankful that her son was out of the way when the Rector broke in upon her. She had never seen Arthur Langton so violently agitated. ' What is this that Caleb has been about, Rachel ?

I had hoped that he might have some day stood for it and done well in Parliament, but all that is over by his own mad act of social incendiarism. It would be a queer set of electors who would return him after"], [284, "272 RACHEL LANGTON the confounded \u2014 I cannot help using strong lan guage \u2014 Radical rubbish he has been spouting. I, for one, should be very sorry for him to have a wider sphere in which to expose and disgrace him self and his family.' Rachel made every allowance for Arthur's pas sion. She knew that, with his views, he had got great \u2014 nay, taking the usurpation of the schoolroom into consideration, nearly intolerable provocation. ' You cannot think how sorry I am, Arthur,' she began humbly, ' that Caleb has come across these Socialist opinions and laid hold of them in this manner. He is very young, but he was not wont to be so hasty and headstrong. I don't know what has come over him. With regard to my sister Sophy and Caleb's taking possession of your schoolroom in your absence, as the proper ground for such a discussion, the offence is beyond being apologised for, I am afraid.' ' Oh ! I don't blame you,' said the Rector, quickly, pausing for a moment in his rapid walk up and down, while she sat in her usual basket-chair in her window of the drawing-room, with her work thrown down and her hands folded together in her lap, looking at him more helplessly than he had ever seen her look in the long course of their ac quaintance. ' Only why, in the name of common sense and prudent precaution, did you let the woman \u2014 I beg your pardon \u2014 get hold of the fellow? You know that at his age lads are apt"], [285, "STANDING TO HIS GUNS 273 to be infected by rabid notions. He had got into one scrape already, though Heaven knows it was a thousand times more pardonable and would have been far less fatal than this is likely to be.' She answered the first part of his remonstrance, still speaking with great forbearance and self-re straint. ' The woman, as you call her, is my sister and Caleb's aunt. I had not seen her since she was a mere child ; she came on her own invitation. I could not tell beforehand what was her political creed and how it was likely to affect my son. You will suffer me to say that my sister is a good woman, Arthur. Her doctrines may be extrava gant and mistaken \u2014 I myself think they are \u2014 but they are neither selfish nor venal. They are generous and high-minded ; I suppose that is why they attract young spirits, not the meanest or basest of young spirits,' she appealed to him, wistfully. ' No ; but there was a fine sample of what these doctrines led to in the excesses of the French Revolution,' he said, with conviction. ' My sister is not making a long stay,' she told him ; ' she is leaving to-morrow. Hers is a very full and busy life, not only in England but still more in foreign countries. She may never find time or inclination to come here again.' ' She may stay away now till doomsday, the S"], [286, "RACHEL LANGTON 274 mischief is done,' he retorted almost roughly, in a manner quite foreign to his natural character. She was silent, not knowing what to say or do next. He made some amends by reassuring her with regard to the injury done to himself in the appropriation of the schoolroom for a use of which he was certain to disapprove. ' Of course I shall have to contradict the wild nonsense which was spoken, but that will not be difficult to do. Only a very stupid or ill-disposed person would hold me accountable for what was done, without my authority, when I was from home. My char acter as a clergyman is too well established, and my views too generally known, I hope. No, Rachel, believe me, it is not from any sensitive ness because of the insult offered to myself that I am overwhelmed, it is on account of Caleb, your own boy and mine, my brother Gerald's son, my father's heir, over whom I have watched and rejoiced all these years. To think that he has destroyed himself in the space of a few days \u2014 hours, I may say.' He flung himself into a chair opposite hers and looked despairingly at her. She rose up and confronted him, standing tall and erect before him. ' I think you are going too far, Arthur,' she said, with her old austere dignity. ' What has my son done that you should condemn him in these terms? He has committed"], [287, "STANDING TO HIS GUNS 275 a great error, he has been foolish and rash, no doubt, but when I think of what other young men have done \u2014 of how wild young Cholmondeley has shown himself, of what Sir Harry's son is accused \u2014 a mother's partiality may blind me, but I must confess it seems to me that Caleb is as innocent as a child by comparison. What is an error of judg ment in so young a man weighed against wicked ness ? You, Arthur, a good man, a clergyman, must see that.' ' My dear Rachel, you do not understand,' he said, with a groan. ' It is the wide-spread conse quences and the public nature of the enormity I deplore. A gentleman's private shortcomings are his own, for which he must answer to his con science and his Maker. It is a point of honour with his equals and associates to leave him to the Nemesis which is sure to find him out \u2014 unless, indeed, he has sinned so flagrantly against society that it is impossible to overlook the offence.' ' I think I do comprehend,' said Rachel, very stiffly and indignantly. ' So long as a man sins decently, and with a due regard to propriety, he is not to be openly censured. His own class are not called upon to turn against him. \" Let him who is without sin among them cast the first stone.\" ' ' Yes, you may put it so, if you will,' said the Rector, wearily, ' but Caleb has turned against his order and outraged it'"], [288, "276 RACHEL LANGTON ' If he has done so, and blundered ever so lament ably, it has been in the cause of humanity,' pled his mother. ' In the cause of self-conceit and folly rather,' said the Rector, sternly. ' But even the cause of humanity would not make much difference in the verdict passed upon him. For that matter it ought not, since humanity will never be served by a man's slandering and deserting his class and the duties nearest to him. It is like a bird defiling its nest, or a man's pretending to honour and benefit his parish or his town while he defames and robs his household. I tell you, Rachel, the mis chief done is beyond calculation. I have been racking my brains in vain, ever since the news burst upon me, to discover what can be thought of to undo it. I have written to Agatha to come back and see if she can turn Caleb from his wretched delusion. Rachel could not be too thankful that, in addition to writing to summon Agatha, Arthur had not brought over Mrs Arthur to say, ' I told you so. I was certain you would either make Caleb an insipid milk-sop or an ill-bred fanatic' Neither could Mrs Langton regard with any equanimity the probability of Caleb's encountering his uncle and former mentor in the two men's present frame of mind. She thought it was certain that the younger man, in the zeal of his new convic tions and the touchiness of his years, would defy"], [289, "STANDING TO HIS GUNS 277 the elder, and that words would pass between them which might sever the two, which might never be entirely wiped out. The day passed like a day in a bad dream to Rachel, and as the hours dragged on they brought no interruption to the dream either from Sophy or Caleb. Sophy sent down word that she could not stop her work ; she had an immense deal to do yet ; she must ask her dinner to be sent up \u2014 a slice of meat or a bit of cheese and a hunch of bread, with a cup of tea later on, would be all she would need or could find time to eat. Caleb merely came in for a moment to send a message to his mother not to wait dinner or sit up for him, as he had an engagement which might detain him late. Rachel tried to think there was nothing unusual in the desertion and the neglect of ordinary house hold rules. She could only hope that there was no collusion between the deserters, that they were not arranging fresh surprises and shocks to the nerves of the public. She had to seek to occupy herself with her usual routine \u2014 her needlework, the book she was reading, the filling in of the tickets to be supplied to applicants for ' beds ' in the cottage hospital, the apportioning of her share of the prizes which had been adjudged at the cottage flower show, the looking over and balancing her housekeeper's accounts. She had also to attend"], [290, "278 RACHEL LANGTON to her correspondence which was limited to a few friends in Mittesheim who expected to hear from her once in six months. And she had to write sundry notes declining several invitations which were lying unacknowledged. It was simply impossible to contemplate paying visits after the bomb-shell which the master of Langton Hall had flung into the neighbouring country houses. The probability was that he and his mother would be ostracised thenceforth. There would be no farther necessity for them to refuse invitations. Whether that were so or not, the orderly soul of Mrs Langton required that these invitations, though they might be the last, should be answered fitly. Running through all her occupations like a thread of comfort was the reflection that Sophy, the people's delegate, the modern tribune, was going to-morrow. With her departure there might be a lull after the storm \u2014 a lull during which the world round Langton Hall might recover its composure and contemplate calmly, and with an approach to fairness, what should be the end of a young man's dipping into political economy and doing what he liked with his own. Before Mrs Langton had gone up to dress for her solitary dinner, in order that the minds of Webster and the other servants might not be farther exercised beyond the chance of recovery, just as she was raising her head, listening mechanically for the sound of the dressing-bell and then preparing"], [291, "STANDING TO HIS GUNS 279 to rise slowly and obey it, a servant came to tell her that Horrocks, the head gardener, wished to speak to her. ' Tell him to come to the conservatory and I shall go to him there and hear what he has to say,' she sent word, with a sinking heart. ' Had Caleb made the gardens as well as the fields and planta tions free to the people ? Was there no longer a bunch of grapes or a vegetable marrow, a dahlia or a chrysanthemum which he and his mother could call their own ? Fruit and flowers were his to dis pose of certainly, but was the prodigal scattering betimes of his goods, in reality that benign scatter ing of which it had been written that he who dispersed abroad should still find his home garners brimming over with increase ? Horrocks was a comfortable-looking little man, without the crab-apple sourness which is so unac countable and regrettable an attribute of the AJ * modern representative of the gardener Adam. Horrocks was as rotund as one of his cabbages and as rosy as one of his apples, but at this moment his cheerful face was clouded and troubled. However, he addressed Mrs Langton with an air of deprecation and not a voice of complaint \u2014 as Rachel was quick to distinguish with a sense of thankfulness. 'A misfortune has happened, and it ain't any good to try to hide it from you,' said Horrocks, apologetically. ' For that matter, you're bound to"], [292, "280 RACHEL LANGTON hear it now, since it must have happened a good seven days agone. If it had not been for the care lessness of some folks \u2014 meaning young George Darrel and Charlie Wilson,' he named his subor dinates with something like viciousness for the good-natured Horrocks, ' it would have come to light before.' ' What is it, Horrocks ? ' Mrs Langton tried to bring him to the point. 'Well, ma'am, you mind the thunderstorm last Wednesday ? It was none so bad as I've seen 'em often, but no man knows when harm will fall. The lightning must have struck the Squire's tree in the family group in the grounds, south of the kitchen garden. Nobody has been near the place this week, leastways, nobody saw anything wrong till I hit upon it this here afternoon, as I was going to overhaul the flues in the peach wall that they might be right for winter. There was Mr Caleb's tree split nigh in two, with half of its leaves and boughs clean welted.' Something rose up in Mrs Langton's throat and kept her from making any remark for a second. Then she asked quickly, ' Is the tree killed, Horrocks ? Will it not recover from the injury ? ' ' Oh ! bless you, yes, ma'am.' Horrocks willingly softened his tidings. ' It ain't so bad as that comes to. I said half the tree, and when I said half, it mightn't be more than a quarter and a bit.

But the tree won't never be the same again \u2014 never. It is on my conscience to tell you that. The natural shape and proportions are ruined.

But it could not be helped, I'll say that, though it might have been knowed about and seen to sooner.' ' Of course, Horrocks, who can be expected to guard against lightning? Accidents will happen. Do you make the best of the shattered tree.' She dismissed him and turned back into the house, telling herself that omens and forebodings were as silly as they were wrong, weak-minded, utterly and reprehensibly distrustful of God's providence. She had always discountenanced them. What kind of truth was in the sibylline leaves when Gerald's tree and that of his brother Richard were as Horrock said ' fair and flourishing,' while all that was mortal of the two lads, in whose honour the saplings had been planted, had lain mouldering in the dust for many a year ? The unhappy day was followed by as unhappy a night, during which Caleb never came home so far as his mother could ascertain without direct inquiries at the servants. In spite of his prohibition, she had sat up till late waiting"], [294, "282 RACHEL LANGTON for him in vain. After she did go to bed, she lay awake counting the hours till daybreak, when she dropped into an uneasy sleep, haunted by memories of heated election speeches and fierce political tirades, jumbled up with visions of young trees, full of sap and leaf, thrown down, blighted, after they had been caught and held in devouring fire. She was aroused by the entrance of a maid servant who came to tell her that Mr Langton was up, had breakfasted, and was going out, but wished to see Mrs Langton first. Rachel sat up in dismay at having overslept her self, as she supposed. She looked at the timepiece opposite ; it proclaimed that it was still early morn ing. The timepiece must be wrong, she concluded, and consulted her watch, which agreed with the timepiece. As she dressed hastily she remembered that this was the morning on which Sophy was to leave. Here was the explanation of Caleb's alert ness, though he had appeared to forsake his aunt the previous day. There was no saying how soon or in what style that erratic, independent, much sought-after individual, might choose to depart \u2014 a consideration which furnished an additional reason for Mrs Langton's hurrying her toilet. But when Rachel reached the morning room only Caleb was there \u2014 Caleb looking as if he had not been in bed, with his face as white as a sheet, his forehead contracted, his eyes strained, his teeth set, his right arm in a sling, improvised from a"], [295, "STANDING TO HIS GUNS 283 neckerchief. The dress he had worn the day before was in as great disorder as it was possible to be in the case of a young Englishman to whom to be ' well groomed ' every morning, comes as naturally and is as indispensable a performance, as to draw his breath or to open his eyes. Mrs Langton looked at her son, and the spec tacle of the young tree bearing his name, stricken, lapped of its finest branches, never to be the same again, rose irrepressibly before her mind's eye. He did not wait for her to exclaim at his strange appearance, or to ask what ailed his arm, he was feverishly eager to tell her what he was there to say. ' Mother, I was out in the Chequer Plan tation the greater part of last night. I had reason to believe that Burridge meant to oppose any of the village people who might avail themselves of the liberty I had given them, and the Chequer Planta tion is nearest his lodge. The opposition was utterly unwarrantable on his part,' declared Caleb, knitting his brows still harder, ' though it might not be ill meant according to the light in which he saw my act. It seems he held I was off my head, not accountable for what I said or did, and not to be obeyed by my own servants.' ' And what happened ?

' Why nobody came up to"], [296, "284 RACHEL LANGTON take advantage of my offer during the morning or the afternoon when I was waiting to show them the way I cannot explain, unless the reasons were that working men are not usually disengaged at these seasons and that there is something in the force of habit. They came as they were accustomed to come, no doubt,' with a grim, mechanical smile, ' in the late dusk, before the moon was up. I was not the only person who was watching for them. Bur ridge was on the outlook also, and when they saw that they dodged him. There was a couple of them, one a stranger who had only been in the village for a day or two, working a turn for Ray at the Warren Farm, the other was Lennie Sievewright, who used to be one of the choir boys, whose mother is one of your \" pet almswomen,\" as Sophy calls them.' ' Lennie Sievewright ! Oh, Caleb, Caleb !

' I am afraid that she trusted to a broken reed, then, though I am at a loss to say what harm he was doing under the circumstances,' said Caleb, with an attempt at levity which immediately broke down, ' Burridge, in his turn, dodged the pair, and I dodged the three till we got as far as the fence between our ground and Colonel Poyntz's spinny. The man and the lad crept through, Burridge and I following, Burridge unaware of my neighbourhood, and the next minute Poyntz's keepers were upon"], [297, "STANDING TO HIS GUNS 285 the whole set. There has been poaching going on there for some time back, it appears, and when Poyntz came home ten days ago \u2014 he has been on the Continent, you know \u2014 he determined to put it down. He doubled his men and had relays of them scouring the place every night. There was a great row, a regular scrimmage ; I never saw any thing like it save a well played football match,' asserted Caleb, a kind of boyish realisation of the scene struggling with his earnestness and his thinly veiled agitation. ' The long and the short of it is,' he began to huddle together his details, ' Sievewright and the strange fellow were caught; Poyntz's keepers never offered to touch me, though I neither made off nor tried to hide my identity. I suppose it was the usual favour shown to a gentleman mixed up in what might be regarded as a discreditable affray,' broke off Caleb, with a sneer. ' But I don't mean to avail myself of any such privileged loop-hole,' he said, pulling himself together, looking his hand somest and displaying a close resemblance to the mother who was standing listening to him in doubt and perturbation. ' The men are to be examined at Westbridge, and in all probability committed to jail to-day. It was I who invited them to the ex pedition in the Langton covers, and it was Burridge who, in the course of thwarting me, drove them into Poyntz's snare.

' What nonsense is this you are talking ? Sophy has a great deal to answer for if you cannot reason more correctly than this comes to. No magistrate would commit you.' ' I don't know that,' said Caleb, with a mixture of youthful pride and angry defiance. ' I believe I have set the whole county against me as a beggarly Radical, a beastly deserter from their ranks, a shameless renegade. That is the hue-and-cry which will go abroad against me.' 'You are greatly exaggerating your own con sequence, and you are the most illogical boy I ever met, though you are fresh from college,' said his mother, striving desperately to set his conduct in a ridiculous light, and to induce him to laugh at him self, when the victory \u2014 such a poor victory as it must be \u2014 would be half won. ' How could you be poaching in your own preserves, or how could the men you invited to come be poaching, unless in the sense that they had not taken out game licences, with which no doubt you were prepared to present them ?

' Mother, that is not all,' he owned, in an under tone, as if he could not trust himself to say the words aloud ; ' Burridge was hurt. He was knocked down in the struggle and confusion. We had none of us guns, but we were all armed with stout sticks, and a heavy stick, just as it happens to be wielded, if it hit a vital spot, may tell \u2014 may kill a man.' Caleb's own jaw fell for a second, the next he made a great effort instinctively and recovered himself, recalled to self-control by the ashen hue his mother's face had taken. ' No, he is not dead,' he said hurriedly, ' but he is still senseless, lying with his eyes half-open, without sight in them, as he looked last night, when he did not stir and one of the keepers held a lantern to his face.' Caleb gave an involun-"], [301, "289 PAYING THE PENALTY tary shudder at the recollection. ' He has been brought home and had a doctor. Oh !

' Yes, Mark Burridge,' repeated Caleb, with a quiver of his lips. 'You did not strike him, Caleb \u2014 your old ser vant ? ' ' How can I tell, mother ? ' cried Caleb, passion ately. ' I have said we were all mixed up and striking together in a perfect jnele'e. The moon was not up and the dark side of the lantern was to the front there. Perhaps no one can tell who gave Burridge the blow ; but this I know, I took that stick for the purpose of laying it across his stubborn back if he put a hand on any of the people I had made free of the place.

I should be a cowardly, treacherous brute if I did anything of the kind.' It was impossible to move him from his resolu tion, and there was not time to summon the Rector, even if that would have been a judicious step. Only one thing occurred to Rachel as a thing she might do. It was to go the moment her son had left to the telegraph office at the post office and telegraph to the old lawyer, Seacombe, whose house was on the outskirts of Westbridge, to drive into the court and do what he could for his young client ' in trouble with poachers.' Before Caleb could start, Sophy, who, strange to say, had been entirely forgotten, walked in, fully armed for her permanent campaign. She was still entirely unconscious of the dire disaster which had followed on her visit. But she was well accustomed to such casualties, and took them in general as a matter of course, rather as an exciting stimulant than as a chilling damper to her enthusi asm. She was not quite so cool when enlightened as to what had taken place the previous night. She did not seek to discourage her nephew from fulfilling his purpose, neither did she urge him to carry out his intention. Perhaps she saw no need when he was doing it of his own accord. ' A pity about the man Burridge,' she said briefly, but she did not express any pity for Caleb or Rachel"], [303, "PAYING THE PENALTY 291 till the young man was gone and Sophy was bidding her sister good-bye. Then she said with half-smothered compunction, struggling to look out of her big bright blue eyes, ' I always knew, Rachel, that the cause asks many sacrifices and many victims, but I did not foresee what it might cost you. I do not say I would have acted differently if I had. When we put our hand to the plough there is no drawing back \u2014 there is the plucking out of the right eye and the cutting off of the right hand instead. But you will believe me that I am sorry for your trouble ? ' ' I believe you, Sophy,' answered Mrs Langton, sadly. ' I dare not say that I regret having brought it upon you,' went on Sophy, her eyes kindling again. ' Can you suffer in a nobler cause than in that of seeking to lift up the helots of the world ? Is it not better to suffer with them than to rejoice with those who spurn them ? ' Rachel could have answered that, to her mind, there was no question of spurning in the fact of the existence of the Game Laws. There might be a certain amount of injustice and temptation in them, still, it did not merit intense language and revolutionary treatment. But she had learned long ago that even the ' retort courteous ' was a dubious weapon to use, when the aim was to avoid reproaches and preserve peace. ' I hope I am resigned to suffer if I am called"], [304, "292 RACHEL LANGTON upon to do it,' she said, with patient evasiveness, 'but I wish Caleb had been spared. He is so young ; he has his life before him.' ' No,' Sophy forbade the reservation emphatic ally, 'you would not deny him his highest privilege. You did not desire to see him a mere pleasure-seeking, self-indulgent man of the world. You had higher aspirations for him than even the prospect of his developing into a respectable county gentlemen, presiding decorously at Quarter Sessions, making the best of his property for the sake of the son who is to come after him, hunting six days out of seven when the scent holds in the season, and managing to shoot something \u2014 pigeons or wild ducks, or rabbits, when partridges, pheas ants and hares are not to be had \u2014 in order to pass the time for the rest of the year. Ain't it queer?' broke off Sophy, with one of her quizzical looks, ' when the squires are so fond of sport, that they can be content to keep it all to themselves and not to share the least little bit with their neigh bours ? ' Mrs Langton had not the spirit to answer. She was reminding herself that she had coveted more for Caleb than the average merits and successes of his class, and asking herself if such covetousness had been presumption ? ' You may depend upon it we'll not desert our young recruit,' Sophy was briskly pledging herself. Then she fell into the grandiose and patronising"], [305, "PAYING THE PENALTY 293 view which crossed her perfect simplicity. ' We are not so poor and weak as we look. We have multitudes of adherents in all quarters, at home and abroad, and every day is multiplying them a hundredfold. Nothing shall be left undone which can be done for Caleb, you may depend upon it. If there is a prosecution, the charge shall be sifted to the bottom. There will be no lack of emissaries to ferret out who struck the blow, and whether it was not, as is most likely, delivered in self defence.' ' I must beg that you will do nothing of the kind,' said Rachel, hastily. ' We are very much obliged to you, Sophy, but I, for one, trust that Caleb's defence may be open and above board, and that he will not owe his safety to anything underhand or secret.' ' Poor Rachel, you cannot get rid of your acquired prejudices,' said Sophy, with calm commisera tion, ' but you must not decline our assistance, were it only for the reason that, if we have got a friend into a scrape, it is our part to get him out again.' Then Sophy's grand figure vanished from the haunts of well-bred, well-satisfied people, who had no quarrel with the world as it was, no contest with the laws, who were abundantly pleased with society as it existed. Sophy was once more lost in that dark, tempestuous sphere of the destitute, the desperate, the depraved, defrauded, tortured, which"], [306, "294 RACHEL LANGTON she had made her own ; in which the woman walked like an angel of light. Within a week of Sophy's departure, however, a concise, officially-sounding statement reached Rachel. ' The stranger passing through the village, who took advantage of Caleb Langton's permission to the village labourers to come up and have a shot or cast a fly on the Langton Hall estate, is a thorough scamp, a regular loafer of the worst description. We know that he has been in half-a dozen prisons and served as many sentences \u2014 all richly deserved. We have nothing to do with him now. Later, when he is at his last resource, he will doubtless turn to us and we will receive him, for we reject no man. In the meantime, we call attention to the fact that it is not unlikely it was the tramp, who is a powerfully-built man, who struck Burridge, and that the assailant knows it. If not, he has a shrewd suspicion that it was not Caleb Langton who dealt the blow, from the very impudent manner in which the tramp is screening himself behind the gentleman. The lad called \" Lennie,\" is not equally well-informed, but he has an inkling of the truth. Unfortunately, in addition to being dazed with fright, he is in the elder man's clutches, from having been privy to an attempt at arson \u2014 of which he gave no information. Lennie dare not speak out and contradict the rascal who has been his tempter, but the truth might be got from him by a little skilful cross-examination."], [307, "PAYING THE PENALTY 295 If the affair comes to a trial, and it is found necessary, there are those who will come forward at whatever personal risk and prove the contents of this paper.' So far as Caleb's safety was concerned no such proof as Sophy promised was wanted. Mr Sea combe had been able to obey Rachel's summons, and had succeeded in convincing the young Squire that, if he wished to serve the man and lad in custody, his place was not to surrender himself on a vague self-accusation, but to get himself sub p\u0153naed as a witness and give evidence on the prisoners' behalf. 'It is all that woman with her head in the clouds,' old Seacombe said, with a groan. ' I thought she had improved, and that the lad was going to do well, but what could one expect from the son of a mother who was unable to recognise the value of the law of primogeniture, even when it benefited her own child ? ' The next three or four days, while Mark Bur ridge's life hung in the balance, and while the whole county \u2014 nay, the whole country, through the medium of the newspapers \u2014 was ringing with Caleb Langton's apostacy, were chill, darkening days of dumb misery to Rachel. Yet she was left entirely to her self-accusations, nobody else reproached her openly. The Rector, after that first morning when Caleb's delinquency had burst upon him, was even tender in sparing"], [308, "296 RACHEL LANGTON her. Agatha, who had come back to Ryelands at her brother's summons, was equally gentle and forbearing, though it was evident that she con sidered the glory had departed from the Langtons of Langton Hall. She mourned their eclipse among the county luminaries. Mrs Arthur herself, while she appeared again on the scene a little like a bird of ill-omen, was so far silenced and subdued by the extent of the calamity. To think Caleb had done it, when he had such a good seat in the saddle and had won the brush twice last season ! Why, he might be some ' cocky ' lad of a tradesman, with his mind jaundiced by shop work and confine ment, in addition to those odious, treasonable Hyde Park demonstrations. But how could anybody blame his mother, when she went so far as to admit, ' I am afraid I have managed badly ? I wish I had stayed away in Germany, and sent him home to be brought up among his father's people who knew better what he could not do, and what would be required of him.' Of course she was right, but imagine Mrs Langton owning that to her ! Mrs Arthur pointed out the anomaly in a disarmed, almost an awed, tone. Nor did Mark Burridge and the outlying members of the Burridge family fail in their traditional loyalty to the Langtons. They would not, in spite of Caleb's testimony, so much as admit the possibility that he could have had anything to do with Burridge's hurt. They not"], [309, "PAYING THE PENALTY 297 only received all the devoted attention lavished by the Hall and the Rectory in the most magnani mous and grateful spirit, they never failed to welcome the crushed and despondent young Squire with the cheerful assurance that when Mark did open his eyes he would be main pleased to see his master at his bedside, and to be told how often he had come to inquire for him. If these for giving persons looked askance at anybody it must be granted that it was at Mrs Langton. Sure, she was only a Langton by marriage, and she was not of the right sort. She might have had summat to do with the mischance, for was not the lecturing woman, who got hold of poor Mr Caleb, and playing on his goodness of heart, led him astray, madam's own sister ? Nathless, madam was the Squire's mother, who meant well and knew no better. And it seemed to Rachel that she did not deserve anything better than to bear the heaviest burden of condemnation. Why had she not re sisted to starvation the measure by which she was lured from Mittesheim ? She had never been fit to be a squire's mother any more than she had been fit to be a squire's wife. If she had but been firm then might Caleb have been safe, happy and useful, doing his Master's work, a simple Lutheran pastor, well-nigh as poor as the poorest of his flock, free to identify himself with them, as he ministered to them alike in sacred and secular matters ? Or why could she not have"], [310, "298 RACHEL LANGTON shared the ' low content ' of those squires' mothers who were satisfied when their sons did well by themselves, committed no flagrant breach of the moral law, aimed at being successful breeders of stock and mighty Nimrods, like their fathers, and nothing more? Why had she objected to Caleb's entering the army and seeing the world \u2014 not so much because he must stand to be shot at when duty called him, but because he must contem plate the universe through barrack windows ? Why had she set her face against his marrying the young actress Essex Etheredge when his heart was in it? Rachel, even in the middle of her morbid remorse, was not so egotistical or impressed with a sense of her own importance as to feel convinced that it had rested with her to make or break that match. Yet she could not tell. Essex Etheredge was not like the generality of girls in more respects than in her having been bred to the profession of an actress for which she was exceptionally gifted. She had frankly exhibited, in various ways, the esteen she enter tained unsought for Caleb's mother, and the respect she paid to her opinions. Might it not be that the certain opposition of all his friends, some of whom were her friends also, and the declared hostility of his mother, constituted that turning of a straw which had prevented the girl from pausing in her career to give a second thought to her young lover and to listen to his suit ? Was"], [311, "PAYING THE PENALTY 299 it not possible that Caleb had not been far wrong in salving his wounded pride and affection by the persuasion that his friends had been his worst foes and had wrought his defeat. At last the crisis was past. Mark Burridge rallied and was pronounced out of danger. He did open his dim eyes and say heartily, \u2014 ' Hallo ! sir, are you there? Now, Mr Caleb, don't you trouble your head about me. Bless you ! a clout like yon, not to say dealt with the butt-end of a gun, but with a bit ashen stick, won't finish the likes of me. As to your having felled me, as they've telled me you've got it into your head, it is fair folly. Why, Mr Caleb, it mun be you as is sick and not me, if you stick to that maggot. You'll forgive me for saying you may have learnt fencing at your college, but you've neither the skill nor the strength, no, nor the will, a lad and a gentleman like you, to trip me up, look out for the weak spot and all but brain me. Moreover, a Langton never have strook a Burridge in the whole course of the connection.' With the injured man's recovery the entire charge was suffered to fall to the ground, the more readily that the strange tramp was urgently wanted on another count for which Langton could not by any diseased self-consciousness hold him self responsible. As for the village lad, Lennie, he had already got a lesson which he was not likely to forget."], [312, "300 RACHEL LANGTON For anything farther, so far as the people were concerned in this curious climax of modern social ism, the villagers of Langton showed themselves doubtful and slow in availing themselves of Caleb's impulsive ' Open sesame! The shooting season was well advanced, and with regard to the hunting-field, the M.F.H. was heard to say sardonically that though their subscription was low enough, it was beyond the reach of paupers. Happily young Mr Langton did not, with the most liberal, or rather licentious, intentions, have it in his power to invite all the idle louts of his village to be transformed into beggars on horseback as members of the hunt. There was a vexed question among these same staggered and perplexed louts. Did the liberty which had been granted by the young Squire, whether he was touched in his head or not, apply only to that fast passing season ? Would it re quire to be renewed every year, like a licence, or was it permanent ? If the debaters had consulted Caleb himself he would have answered them shortly that no gentleman by nature or by arbitrary dis tinction \u2014 it did not signify much which, would go back from his word. If they had known and under stood him thoroughly, they would have compre hended that he would be the last man to do so, for hastiness does not always imply fickleness. But as it happened, the plantations and stubble fields of Langton Hall and their owner who had spoken un advisedly, yet would not disappoint his neighbour,"], [313, "PAYING THE PENALTY 301 had the benefit of the doubt. So had the Rector and Mr Etheredge with the shooting parties from the Rectory and Ryelands who took their sport in accordance to old use and wont over Caleb's land. It was Caleb himself who was ostracised from the date of Sophy's admirable lecture and his own in flammable tirade at the unauthorised meeting in Arthur Langton's schoolroom."], [314, "302 CHAPTER XIV ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION What was to become of Caleb? He was not a weather-cock to veer back to his former easy going, nebulous frame of mind. Pie was a clever, thoughtful, young fellow of his age, with a strong dash of his mother's ultra - conscientiousness. Now he was ashamed to look people in the face, though he had only done what he pleased with his own. But like the boy Lennie, Caleb had acquired certain convictions which it was not probable that he would ever wholly resign ; something of Sophy's ideas would remain with him to the end of his existence ; at the same time, the first blaze of his enthusiasm had sobered down. He was even sen sible that he had acted with singular injudicious ness. He had done a vast deal of harm instead of good. He had made rash, ill-considered overtures, for which the time was not ripe and nobody was prepared. He had given deadly provocation where a wise man, nay, anybody who stopped short of being an idiot \u2014 he told himself bitterly, would have been chary of scattering fire and fury and launch ing insults right and left. He had brought down"], [315, "ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION 303 his world about his ears, and he was likely enough to perish in the ruins of his social reputation. He must pay the penalty, yet it was hard to submit to be looked on, thenceforth, by his fellow squires with unqualified, ineradicable distrust, to have the cold shoulder turned upon him by his equals wherever he went. Hitherto his moderate Liberal ism had been good-naturedly tolerated by the Tory majority in the county. What with his Langton descent and connections, his bachelorhood, his good looks and good bearing, his unencumbered estate, his accomplishments \u2014 in private theatricals, for ex ample \u2014 he had been decidedly popular among his acquaintances. There was a strong suspicion of the boy about Caleb to this day, for he half-sulked, half-moped at the mess he had got into, and threatened to aban don the situation, which had been largely of his own making. He said he was neither fit for a squire nor for a delegate of the people. He could not see that there was anything better for him than to make himself scarce by retreating to one of the colonies. He could work with his hands there without provoking objections. Nobody would call him an iconoclast, though he invited his convict-descended chum in the next settlement to come over and help him to shoot opossum or wild turkey in his own tract of country. Really the views of Caleb's friends, with the exception of his mother, were not much more"], [316, "304 RACHEL LANGTON sanguine concerning him. ' Ben says Caleb is young and it will come right in time, but then Ben knows the world so much better than he knows the dear old county,' said Agatha Ether edge, disconsolately. ' If Caleb had committed any ordinary faux pas at his age it might not have been counted for much, but to make an on slaught on an institution like the Game Laws, to be guilty of bidding any homely rustic, any dis reputable tramp come up and shoot his covers, oh ! how could he ever be capable of such mad misconduct, such treason against his order ? I can see nothing for it but that he must go abroad for a long, long time. Perhaps if he stayed away for a considerable term of years the story might be hushed up and die out by slow degrees. Or he might arrange with the next heirs to break the entail, and have done with the place by selling it. Far better that than to live on here at perpetual war with all the old allies of the family, shunned and vilified by them.' But at the thought of there being no longer a Langton at Langton Hall Agatha bowed her graceful head and wept far salter tears than she had shed when she and her brother Arthur were left all but destitute by the child Caleb's acces sion to the property. ' Why cannot he recant publicly ? ' proposed Mrs Arthur, boldly. ' Call another meeting in the schoolroom, with Arthur in the chair this time, and tell these oafs of"], [317, "ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION 305 village people that they were very stupid to come there before without Arthur's sanction ; that he, Caleb, is sorry, but it was all a foolish mistake; he never meant what he said the other night. If Caleb had been in the habit of taking more wine than was good for him, he might have put the blame on that' ' I cannot listen to you,' said Rachel, trembling in every limb with such hot indignation as she had not felt for many a day. She was speaking to the two ladies as they sat together in the greyness of the November afternoon. They had come over to bear her company at her five o'clock tea, to com miserate her, to seek about for some loop-hole of escape from the family bouleversement accom plished by Caleb. ' I am not to the manner born of a squire's mother and the mistress of an establishment like this, but I have my own feelings and principles. Caleb has been hot headed and wrong, as he sees himself, but what crime can you lay to my son's charge, Agatha, that he should dwell in exile or cut himself off from his inheritance ? And you,' turning sharply on Mrs Arthur, 'how dare you suggest that he should swallow his honest, courageous words, how ever simple, and give himself the lie ; or that he should skulk behind a false screen by assuming the loathsome disguise of a drunkard.' ' Come away, Agatha,' cried Eleanor, starting up with scared eyes, and plucking at her sister-in- u"], [318, "306 RACHEL LANGTON law's gown ; ' she does not know what she is say ing. We ought not to mind her.' ' No, don't mind me,' said Mrs Langton, master ing herself and smiling faintly. ' I know you mean to be kind and to stand by us, but you will forgive me for saying you are miserable com forters. You would tempt me to believe that my sister Sophy is right when she argues that the artificial distinctions of society are the curse of humanity.' ' Come away, come away,' Mrs Arthur kept urg ing her companion, ' she is getting rabid too ; it must be in the family. Oh, poor Caleb ! ' Rachel could have laughed aloud in her soreness of spirit, and said, ' Don't be alarmed, Mrs Arthur, our complaint is not infectious, at least, not for such as you.' But she was glad that they did not mind her. Agatha, always a peacemaker, even drove over again the next day to show her perfect amity. On this second occasion Mrs Etheredge confined herself to neutral topics for the most part. She talked to Rachel in her pleasant fashion of the wintriness of the weather. She feared it would soon send her and her chicks back to town. They had been loth to return because Etheredge was not there. It was a great secret, but he was at Berlin on a diplomatic mission. She added emphatically that she would be so sorry to go, she was always grieved to quit the neighbourhood of dear old Langton."], [319, "ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION 307 It was only when Mrs Etheredge was nearly ready to leave that she said hurriedly, ' Now, dear Rachel, I am going to ask you if you will allow a friend who drove over with me, and has been wait ing in the carriage, to come in and toast her cold toes for five minutes before we start for the station. I did not bring her in, because I would not do it without your knowledge and permission. It is Essex Etheredge ; she is a strange girl \u2014 a bundle of enthusiasm, like somebody else I know. She said she could not rest till she had come down and told you what she thought of this \u2014 this esclandre about poor dear Caleb. She is only at Ryelands for the day, she has to hurry back to town to fulfil her engagement to-night, at one of the theatres where the winter season has already begun.' ' Surely, I shall be glad to see any friend of yours, Agatha,' said Rachel, gravely, only a little stiffly, ' while I can have no objection to receive Miss Etheredge.' ' Is Caleb at home ? ' asked Mrs Etheredge, as if it was the most natural question in the world. ' I believe he is in the library. He sits a great deal there,' answered his mother, with an involun tary fall in her voice. ' He does not care parti cularly for tea, and when he has it, it is sent in to him there.' ' The unsocial fellow ! ' commented his aunt, with an excellent imitation of lightness in her tone. ' I"], [320, "308 RACHEL LANGTON should not encourage him in such bearish habits if I were you, Rachel. I never let Ben miss his cup of tea with me, even when he is busiest. I shall go and speak to Caleb and call him to order.' Thus Mrs Langton was alone when Essex Etheredge came into the room. She had the same earnest, sincere face, with its paleness lit up by the spirit within, as a lamp reflects the inner illumina tion, that she had brought to Langton Hall when she came there, one afternoon in the previous summer, to ask Rachel why she objected to the play at Ryelands, and whether she would not consent to see and judge for herself? ' I am afraid I am taking a great liberty in in truding upon you, Mrs Langton,' she said, in her sweet, penetrating voice, 'as I did when I called here on my own account some months ago. And I shall be taking a still greater liberty in what I am going to say, but you must not think Mrs Etheredge is in fault I am saying it from myself, and I told her she must bring me over since I had come down from town on purpose to say it to you.' ' I am greatly obliged to you for taking so much trouble, Miss Etheredge,' said Rachel, somewhat mystified. ' No, the obligation is all on my side,' Essex corrected her quickly. ' It was to relieve my own mind that I came.' She had taken Mrs Langton's hand and still held it tightly in her own ungloved"], [321, "ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION 309 hand. Suddenly, to Rachel's surprise and some what to her discomfiture, Miss Etheredge stooped and kissed the hand she held. ' I thought you would allow me to tell you that I heard what your son did, and I liked, oh ! how I liked and admired him for being so carried out of himself, so foolish, as people said. It might be a tremendous blunder \u2014 I cannot judge of that\u2014 but it was a blunder of so rare a kind, such an over-generous, over-noble blunder, that one may well make much of it.' ' It was very short-sighted and reckless,' stam mered Rachel, shaking her head ; ' you are the first person I have heard praise him for it. Even Sophy, my sister, though she had gone hand in hand with him, did not applaud him for the course he took eventually, though she would have done what she could to defend him from the consequences. I imagine she thought he ought to have known better, and should have held her back if necessary, in place of pushing forward in advance of her. I am con vinced she did not know all he was going to say, I hardly think he knew himself, when he began that unlucky speech which was in such miserable taste under the circumstances.' ' I am surprised and disappointed to hear you say that,' cried Essex, with her expressive face falling a little. ' I thought you and she would have recognised how fine the action was, though it was a mistake, I suppose. I have heard of Sophy Green and her mission, and I have always thought her life"], [322, "RACHEL LANGTON 310 must be superb, sublime, though I am not prepared to say that she is not blundering also, one of those glorious gropings after the truest and best which must begin with stumblings. But she ought to have felt that Mr Langton deserved to be held in honour. Think what young men are, as a rule, what a barrier of caste he broke through, what ridicule and contumely he braved. I could not have believed it was in him to do what he did. I thought he was just like other young men, only rather more clever, if you will forgive me for speak ing my mind.' ' My dear, I don't know that he meant half what you are putting into his action. He only did it because he was young and carried away by the feel ing of the moment, without the power of stopping to reflect and weigh results. But will you tell him what you think ? ' solicited Rachel, clasping the girl's hand in hers, her own heart swelling and softening indescribably at the warm, unstinted praise in the room of the universal censure to which she had lately been condemned to listen. At that moment Caleb entered the room in com pany with Mrs Etheredge. He had not been told of the presence of Essex, and started in surprise at the sight of her. He took a quick step forward and then drew back, flushed and uncertain, contenting himself with a bow to the unexpected visitor. His nerves had been considerably tried lately. The smooth bloom of his youthful comeliness had given"], [323, "ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION 3II place to certain worn lines, stamped too deeply to be ever effaced. He looked years older and manlier than when he acted in the garden play with Essex on that splendid summer afternoon at Ryelands. Essex hesitated for an instant, but it was not natural to her to fear being misunderstood ; she was nearly without self-consciousness, and Mrs Langton had made a request to her. She advanced to where he stood, in doubt what to do or say. ' Mr Lang ton,' she addressed him with her straightforward steadfastness, 'your mother has just kindly per mitted me to say what I think. Will you in your turn let me repeat to you what I said to her, because she wishes it ? ' ' I shall be glad to hear whatever you have to say to me, now and always, Miss Etheredge, whether my mother wishes it or not,' he replied. He folded his arms, leant against the window near him, and spoke with a ceremonious politeness which he was not able to keep entirely in check, though he was indignantly sensible that it savoured of resent ment. ' My opinion is not worth much,' said Essex, un deterred by his manner, her own manner being per fectly simple, modest and friendly. ' You may not care for my sympathy, but I do think the proposal you made to the people in the schoolroom, as coming from you, a squire, to labouring men on a point about which there has been strife between squires and peasants ever since the English were a nation,"], [324, "312 RACHEL LANGTON was fine ; ' and her beautiful face beamed and glowed with pleasure. ' I acted like an ass,' said Caleb, with his mother's bluntness, frowning and turning partly away, while he coloured high. 'That may be,' answered Essex, frankly, 'but there are asses and asses. Heroism is better even than common sense.' ' If I was heroic at all, I was mock heroic,' said Caleb, doggedly. ' No, don't slander yourself. Be true to yourself, sir, and nobody else will dare call you a liar. There was neither falsehood nor mockery in what you did. The false article is deliberately concocted, not im pulsively poured forth unseasoned and ungarnished for the public palate. Besides, one is not guilty of hanging out paste and tinsel, when the only reward to be had is that of being stoned and driven beyond the pale. I could have told that you were honest the first day I saw you ; and you acted honestly and with all your soul when we played together.' ' I did not think that you wasted so much atten tion upon me,' said Caleb, drawing a long breath, with his eyes beginning to sparkle. ' But, seriously, Miss Etheredge, I ought to be honest with you, since you are so good as to give me credit for honesty. Though I think alike with Sophy on many points I am not at all clear. My principal motive in speaking as I did that night was not the same as it used to be when I spoke at the Union. I was a"], [325, "ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION 313 vain young idiot ; I had an irresistible inclination, not so much to purl and gush as to startle my audience, and create a sensation anyhow.' ' That was not your principal motive,' she con tradicted him flatly. ' It might have been one of your lower motives \u2014 we all have lower motives, you know,' she appealed to him ingenuously. ' But what chiefly impelled you was a strong desire to put within their reach, once in a way, in the course of their drudging lives,a crumb from your abundance. Shooting and fishing were privileges which your audience knew gentlefolks prized above all things. The simple folks sympathised with the gentle folks to such an extent that in their undisciplined youth, if not in their mature years, the men had often risked livelihood, reputation and liberty to snatch surreptitiously at the gain. For the more the masters value it, you are aware the more steadily and sternly they deny it to the servants, in case the masters' lordly battues should dwindle, and the bulging game-bags be less full. That is the common rule which you chose to set aside for a change. Just because you knew the keen delight of sport in your own person, you wished to share it with the dumb hewers of wood and drawers of water standing outside the gates of paradise ; you gave them leave to enter in where you were con cerned, that they might try what it was like.' ' You do me far more than justice,' said Caleb in a low, stirred tone, intended for her ear alone."], [326, "314 RACHEL LANGTON ' You must grant me one more favour, else your kindness will be but cruelty. You must leave me the hope of thanking you better some day.' Something in his voice caught her ear. She looked up, startled out of her intrepid, self- forgetful enthusiasm, and blushed rosy red. Mrs Etheredge was covertly watching the pair, with intelligent interest, from a little distance. ' A few months ago it would never have done,' she told herself, ' but after what has come to pass I am not sure that it would not be the best thing which could happen. It will serve to show that the poor dear fellow is thoroughly unconventional and eccentric like his mother, and one eccentricity may help to drive out the remembrance of another from people's minds. Better that he should go on the stage himself and act in every theatre in London and the provinces than run tilt at a gentleman's cherished lines and immemorial prerogatives. But I make no doubt that she will do the thing com pletely, if she does it at all. She will retire from the dramatic profession, and content herself with an occasional benefit for a charity, with \" histrionic studies \" in the schoolroom, or with those private theatricals in which poor dear Eleanor counted on shining. At least there is a chance of the poor dear boy's having a charming companion in that voyage round the world everybody takes nowadays, which is the blessed refuge of all the culprits in society. But will she listen to him ?"], [327, "ESSEX ETHEREDGE'S PRIVATE OPINION 315 She is so proud and fond of her calling, I should have thought it would have needed a far greater inducement than Caleb at his best could offer, to make her give it up. It will be a wonder to me, and I am afraid it will be a sacrifice on Essex's part, considering that she might have aspired to a much higher marriage, if she did marry. But she is like Caleb, she will take her fate into her own hands, and she is unlike other girls in more respects than in being on the stage. I am not certain that the very wild, eccentric conduct which would, with reason, repel and deter another kind of girl, may not attract and win Essex. I should think there is something in it \u2014 that his dreadful escapade has taken her fancy, else why should she travel down from town just to reassure his mother and restore to him his self-respect ? ' It is hard to measure the nature of inducements, especially when they are addressed to our neigh bours. Inducements constitute a case in which one man's meat is another man's poison. There is one thing which is undeniable, that love is more than art, and that the stage of life is wider, freer and fuller than the stage behind the footlights, even to the most infatuated wearer of the buskin. ' He will let me act sometimes,' Essex excused herself to herself and to the world. ' He is not a bit ashamed of my acting. He will like me to arouse in young people, in girls such as I once was myself, a proper appreciation of my little share of the"], [328, "316 RACHEL LANGTON great players' faculty.

When we come back, I'll tell them more world-wide stories, and wake them up to the know ledge of the great emotions which stir all humanity, and make it stronger, truer, and more pitiful for the knowledge.' ' We have to live and learn,' said Rachel Langton in fervent thankfulness, as she stole away to wipe her eyes unseen, while the joy bells were yet ring ing in her hearing. They were the joy bells of Langton Church, clashing and pealing for a marriage solemnised within its old grey walls, a marriage in which the Rector performed the cere mony, and a future Cabinet Minister gave away the bride.
