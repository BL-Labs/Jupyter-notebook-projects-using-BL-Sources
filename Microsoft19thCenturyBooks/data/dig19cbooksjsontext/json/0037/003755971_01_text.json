If fuch is the cafe, The History of the Bees will, moft probably, be deemed unworthy of notice.

XV Why Addifon had not more refpecl for a beau tiful Latin Poet, is a problem not eafy to be folved. Virgil tells us that he was tempted to defcribe a beautiful garden, but being eager to clofe his Poem, he did not chufe to expatiate on that fubject, but rather leave it to be treated at large by others. In three or four lines he feems to have had the idea of an orchard ; but where is the platform of a garden ? Virgil chofe to bequeath the fubject to future Poets, aliis pojl commemoranda relinquo; but how his filence fhould have more pleafantnefs than one of the beft Latin Poems fince the Aug;uftan age, is a point not eafy to be conceived or un derftood. Addifon, moft probably, advanced his paradox in imitation of Quintilian. That great critic, after obferving, that, in the picture of the facrifice of Iphigenia, Timanthes, the famous artift, reprefented the progrefs of grief rifinsr in a regular climax, moderate in the countenance of Chalcas, in Ulysses more ftrongly expreffed, in Menelaus touched with all the ftrength of colouring, and at laft, when he had exhaufted all his art, threw"], [18, "XVI PREFACE. a veil over the face of Agamemnon, leaving the anguifh of a father to the imagination of every beholder; the fkill and judgement of the artift cannot be too much admired. But how the paffage, in which Salluf chufes to be filent about Carthage, rather than fay too little, can be faid to have any refemblance to the picture of Timanthes, is difficult to conceive, and yet Quintilian makes the comparifon : nonne huic fimile ejl illud Salluflianum, nam de Carthagine tacere fatius puto, quam parum dicere f The exceffive grief of a father was with great art left to the imagination ; but what imagination can figure to itfelf the annals of Carthage?

And yet encouraged by Mr."], [19, "PREFACE XVII Addifon, and lifting under his banner, Dodtor Wharton has thought proper to decide againft Rapin. He talks of Ovidian witticifms, but has not cited a fingle inftance. He objects to the fhort fables occafionally introduced for the fake of variety. In anfwer to this charge, let it be remembered, that Mr. Pope, in his Wind for-ForeJl, has introduced the Fable of Pan and Lodona, in imitation of Ovid's manner; and is that beautiful Poem to be decried on that account? But Rapin s Fables are carica turas of Ovid: how far that is true, may be feen in the following fpecimen of Rapin s manner. The Poet obferves, that the art of planting box round beds of flowers was for a long time unknown. To account for the in trodudtion of it, he relates the following Fable : Prima autem cultum pro fe quasfivit et artem Flora, Corymbiferl celebrat dum munera Bacchi.

That Rapin was not a phlegmatic Poet, may be inferred from the authority of three great judges in all matters of taite and polite litera ture. Martin, the judicious and learned a 2"], [22, "PREFAC E.

He profefledly treads in the foot \" fteps of Virgil.\" The opinion of fuch a critic, who was intimately acquainted with Viro-il's exquifite Poetry, does honour to the memory of Rapin. Virgil, and not Ovid, was the model he chofe to imitate. But Martin does not ftand alone: Bro tier, the celebrated commentator on Taci tus, has given a beautiful Edition of Rapin's Poem, with notes on each book, and the hif tory of gardening from the earlieft ages of the world to the prefent times. He admits that objections were made to the infertion of Fables, but he vindicates thofe digreffions, and in an fwer to the hyper-critics, exprefsly fays, \" It \" is not verfe, but fiction that makes a Poet. \" Take from him the ufe of Fable, and you \" deprive him of that, which gives a grace to \" compolition, and by making the fpirit evapo-"], [23, "PREFACE.

In fupport of his opinion, he cites the following lines from the great Cor- neille, who muft be allowed to be a judge without appeal. cc Qu'on fait d'injure a l'art de lui voter la Fable!

It is fometimes called La Plata, from the river of that name, which rifes in Peru, and running a long courfe, falls into the Paraguay near Buenos Ayres, where their united ftream difcharges itfelf into the Atlantic Ocean. The author of the European Settlements in America (who, Doctor Rabertfon fays, ought not to remain unknown, as his work would do honour to any man in England) informs us, that, early in the laft century, the Jesuits reprefented to the court of Spain, that the empire of the gofpel might be extended into the moft unknown parts of America, and that all thofe countries might be reduced to his Catholic Majesty's obedience, without expence, and without force. This remonftrance was liftened to with attention ; the fphere of the Jesuits was marked out; an uncontroulable liberty was given to them within thofe limits ; and the governors of the adjacent provinces had orders not to interfere.

Upon this flight foundation they built a fuperftructure, which has amazed the world, and added fo much power, that it has brought great envy and jealoufy on their fociety. When they had made a beginning, they laboured with fuch indefatigable pains, and with fuch mafterly policy, that, by degrees, they mo- lified the minds of the moft favage nations ; fixed the moft rambling, and attracted the moft averfe to government. They prevailed upon thoufands of various difperfed tribes of people to embrace their religion, and fubmit to their go- vernment. When they had fubmitted, the Jesuits left nothing undone, that could induce them to remain in fub- jecSlion, or that could tend to increafe their number. It is faid, that from fuch inconfiderable beginnings, their fub jects, feveral years ago, amounted to three hundred thoufand families.

To judge properly of the fervice they have done their people, we muft not confider them in a parallel with the fiourifhing nations of Europe, but as compared with their neighbours, the favages of South America, or with the ftate of thofe In- dians, who groan under the Spanifh yoke. Confidering the matter in this, which is the true light, it will appear, that human fociety is infinitely obliged to the Jesuits, for adding three hundred thoufand families in a well regulated community, in the room of a few vagabond untaught favages, whom they found in the beginning of their million. And indeed it can fcarce be conceived that the government had not fome very extraordinary perfection, which had a princi- ple of increafe within itfelf; which drew others to unite themfelves to the old ftock, and which continued, for fo many years, to fhoot out in a luxuriance of new branches. Nor can we, by any means, blame a fyftem, which pro- duced fuch falutary effects, and which has found that difficult, but happy way, that grand defideratum in politics, of uniting a perfect fubjection to an entire content and fatisfa^tion of the people. This great and generous principle it is to be wiihed were ftudied with more attention by us, who content our- felves with railing at the diligence of an adverfary, which, when founded on moral rectitude, we fhould rather praife and imitate; and who, in our own affairs, ieldom think of ufing other inftruments than force and money.

It appears that in the year 1757, by a convention betwen Spain and Portugal, part of the territory of Paraguay was affigned to the latter ; but the Indians, who occupied the ceded country, refufed to be transferred from one hand to another, like an herd of cattle, without their own confent. A fierce battle enfued, and the natives were defeated by well difciplined European troops. From that time, the Jefuits were beheld with a jealous eye by the Spanifh court, and, at length, in j 767, they were feized by order of the King of Spain, and lent out of America, leaving the Indians to experience for the future the rigours of Spanifh tyranny, inftead of that mild and equitable government, which had for a length of time preferved peace, and virtue, and, by confequence, public hap pinefs. This great revolution was the confequence of that epidemic rage againft the Jefuits, which, in or about the year 1767, inflamed moft of the ftates on the continent, oc cafioned chiefly by the repeated invectives of D'Alembert, Diderot, and others, with Voltaire at their head, who in the part he acted, was guilty of foul ingratitude, fince he himfelf informs us, in a letter prefixed to his tragedy of CFdipus, that he was indebted, in the College of Louis le Grand, for his education, to father Pore, one of the beft writers of Latin, either in profe or verfe, fince the Augus tan Age. The Jesuits, driven out of America, left to the King of Spain an extenfive and well peopled territory, which, in the beginning of their great enterprize, they found almoft uninhabited, and uncultivated.
