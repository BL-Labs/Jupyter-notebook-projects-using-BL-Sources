CHAPTER I. \"FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" Vansittart and his wife never went to the village in the mountains, where all things had been made ready for their coming. Eve spent that afternoon which should have been her last at Cannes in the burial-ground on the hill, now in its glory of May flowers, a paradise of roses and white marble, a place full of tenderest memorials to the early dead, a spot which seemed especially dedicated to those whom the gods love best, the holy ones and pure of spirit, removed from the evil to come for hard middle-life and selfish old age. Eve gave herself up to the VOL. III. B"], [10, "2 THE VENETIANS. luxury of grief on that last day, taking her fond farewell of that quiet bed where, under a coverlet of pale yellow roses, the happy child slept the everlasting sleep. She lingered, and lingered, as the sun sloped towards the dark ridge of hills ; lingered when the great flaming disc touched the rugged line, until there was only the after glow to light her back to Californie. Vansittart had trusted her alone with the steady Benson, now promoted from Peggy's nurse to be Eve's own maid. He had cheques to write and final arrangements to make on this eve of departure ; and he thought that there would be greater tranquillity for Eve in solitude, with only an attendant. It was better there should be no one to whom she could expatiate on her grief, for her talk with him had always tended to hysteria. Thus convenience and prudence had both counselled his leaving her to herself; and it was only when the clock on the mantelpiece chimed the quarter before eight and the shadows deepened in the corners of the room that he felt he had been imprudent. He went hurriedly out to the terrace in front of the villa, and felt that creeping dullness in the air which follows"], [11, "3 \"FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" quickly upon sundown on this southern shore. The carriage stopped at the gate as he went out, and Eve was in his arms, to be welcomed first and scolded afterwards. \" It is with you I am most angry, Benson,\" he said to his wife's attendant ; \" you ought to have been wiser.\" \" I won't have you scold Benson,\" remonstrated Eve ; \" it is my fault. She teased me to come home ever so long ago, and I wouldn't. I wanted to stay with Peggy till the last moment. It was like bidding her good-bye again. It may be years before we come back to Cannes. I didn't know how late it was till we were in the carriage coming home, and I began to feel rather chilly.\" \"You are shivering now, Eve. You should have remembered what Dr. Bright said about sunset.\" \"Ah, that was on Peggy's account. It is different for me.\" \" Well, I won't try to frighten you into a cold. Run to Mrs. Vansittart's room, Benson, and light a good fire. I ordered tea to be ready.\" He almost carried Eve upstairs, and with his own hands manipulated the olive logs, and set"], [12, "4 THE VENETIANS. the merry pine cones blazing and crackling, while she lay on the sofa in front of the fireplace and watched the flames; but the shivering con tinued in spite of the cheery wood fire, and tiderdown coverlet, and hot tea; so Dr. Bright was sent for hurriedly, and came to find his patient with a temperature that indicated grave disturbance. He came, and left only to come back again ; and again and again as night deepened, at intervals of two or three hours ; and between midnight and morning the young wife's existence trembled in the balance, and the husband, pacing to and fro and in and out on the lower floor, ground his teeth and beat his head in a passion of self-reproach, hating himself for having allowed that perilous visit to the cemetery, cursing himself for his folly in not having gone with her if she must needs go. \" There is a blight upon us and upon our love,\" he told himself in his despair. \" Nemesis will have her due.\" His fondest hope was blighted \u2014 the hope of a living link which should bind him closer to his wife and make severance impossible \u2014 a child,"], [13, "5 \" FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" whose innocent eyes should turn from father to mother, and plead to the mother for the father's sin \u2014 the child who, in direst contingency, was to be his champion and his saviour. He passed through an ordeal of such agony and apprehen sion on his wife's account as to make him for the time being comparatively indifferent to the loss of his son, who came upon this mortal scene only to vanish from it for ever ; but when at last, in mid-June, when Californie and her fir woods were baking under a tropical sun, his wife was restored to him, strong enough to travel to cooler regions in the shadow of the great Alps, there fell upon him the sense of an irreparable loss. They went by easy stages to Courmayeur, and established themselves there for the rest of the summer, in a reposeful solitude, keeping aloof from the climbers and explorers and the race of tourists generally. They had their own rooms, in a \" Dependance \" of the hotel, rooms whose windows commanded valley and mountain. Here Eve first felt the tranquillizing influence of Alpine scenery, and her quiet rambles with Van sittart soon brought back the bloom of her girlish beauty, and restored something of the"], [14, "6 THE VENETIANS. frank gladness of those younger years when she and her sisters used to ramble over the undulating ridge of Bexley Hill, and think it a mountain. \" Dear old Bexley,\" sighed Eve, with her eyes dreamily contemplating Mont Chetif ; \" I hope I shall never begin to despise you, even though you are a hill to put in one's pocket as compared with these white giants.\" The peaceful days, the perfect union between husband and wife, revived Eve's spirits and did much to restore her health, sorely shaken by the ordeal through which she had passed. Fever had raged fiercely in the battle between life and death, and the long bright hair, which had made so fair a diadem in the days of her poverty had been shorn from the burning head. She looked quaintly pretty now, with her boyish crop, framing the broad, white forehead with crisp short curls. She laughed when Vansittart talked of next season, when his mother was to lend them the house in Charles Street. \"You can never appear in society with a cropped head for your companion,\" she said. \" People will say you have married a lady doctor, or some other learned monstrosity from Girton."], [15, "\"FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" 7 I shall be tabooed in the smart world where ignorance is de riguenr, and to know anything about books is a sign of inferiority.\" \" What care I if they think my sweet love a senior wrangler disguised as a fine lady ? You are pretty enough to set the fashion of cropped heads.\" They moved slowly homeward in the late autumn, loitering beside the great Swiss lakes till the October mists began to make Pilatus invisible and to hang low over the steep gables of Lucerne. They lingered under Mr. Hauser's hospitable roof so long that the great black St. Bernard lifted his head and howled an agonizing farewell when the carriage drove off to the station with Eve and her husband. That leonine beast was sagacious enough to know that the trunks and travelling-bags and bustle of departure meant something more than the daily drive, and that he was to see these kind friends no more, and eat no more sweet biscuits out of Eve's soft white hands. It was late in October when they found them selves among the pine woods and hillocks of"], [16, "8 THE VENETIANS. Hampshire, and insignificant as the hills were there was pleasure in feeling one's self at home. Eve's mother-in-law was at Merewood to receive them, and to make much of her son's wife, whom she found thinner and more fragile-looking than when she left for the Riviera, but with all the beauty and brightness which had captivated her lover. Mrs. Vansittart's welcome had in it more of affection than she had ever given her son's wife in the past. \" I think you are beginning to love me,\" Eve said, too sensitive not to feel the change. \" My dear child, I always loved you.\" \" Only a very little,\" argued Eve. \" You liked me pretty well in the abstract, 1 dare say, but you did not care for me as Mrs. John Vansittart. It was very natural. You had your own old favourites, any one of whom you would have liked Jack to marry ; dear, nice girls who always wear tidy frocks, play the ' Lieder ohne Worte,' and visit the poor. I was altogether a detri mental.\" \" It was not you, Eve \u2014 only your people.\" \"My people\u2014 meaning my father.

Well, he has not been obtrusive, has he ? He has kept himself in the background.\" \" My dear, he has been admirable, and your sisters, when I came to know them and under stand them, proved altogether unobjectionable. We saw a good deal of each other while you were away.\" \" Sophy told me how kind you had been. Yes, they are good girls. The faults are all on the surface. But the flower of the flock is gone \u2014 the brightest and the most loving. She was all love.'' \" Take comfort, dear ; there is deep sorrow, but there can be no bitterness in the thought of a child's death.\" \"Ah, that is what you religious people say,\" cried Eve rebelliously, \" but I have not faith enough to feel that. Why should she be taken ? Life was all before her, so full of happiness, of beautiful sights and sounds, and joys untasted. She was taken from the evil to come, you will say \u2014 but there might be no evil. There has been no evil in your life ! See how peacefully it has glided by.\""], [18, "10 THE VENETIANS. \" You forget, Eve, that I have had to sorrow for a beloved husband.\" \" Oh, forgive me. Yes, you have felt the burden \u2014 the shadow has fallen upon you too \u2014 the shadow, and the burden of death. Why did the Creator make a beautiful world, and then spoil it ? \" \" Eve, this is blasphemy, \" The heart must rebel sometimes ; one must ask these questions. ' The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.' Is it only the fool who says that? Is it not the bitter cry of all humanity at some time or other ? \" \" Eve, you are writhing under your first sorrow. Let it turn your heart to God, not away from Him. Do you think the unbeliever's creed will give you any comfort ? \" \"Comfort? No. There is no comfort in religion, or in unbelief. Religion only means obedience, and public worship, and kindness to the poor, and a good orderly life. It doesn't mean the certainty of getting back our dead \u2014 somewhere, somehow, and being happy again as we have been.\" \" We can rest in the hope of that, Eve, know ing that we are immortal.\""], [19, "11 \"FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" \" Knowing ? But we don't know. Nobody has ever come back to tell_ us. Oh, if but once, only once, for one moment in a year, our dead could come back and look at us, and speak to us, death would not be death.\" Mrs. Vansittart spoke no more of comfort. It was better perhaps to let the troubled heart tire itself out with grieving. Tranquillity would come afterwards. \" And our son, our son who breathed only to die. He did not live even long enough for baptism. He was dead when the Bishop came hurriedly from his house on the hill. You think perhaps \u2014 you who are a strict Anglican \u2014 that his soul is in limbo \u2014 that he will never see the throne of God. We were going to be so fond of him, Jack and I \u2014 and Peggy wanted to live long enough to see him \u2014 but she was gone before he came, and he didn't care about living.

But God never meant us to rebel, even in our grief. That must not be.\" \" I know I am wicked,\" said Eve, with a long drawn sigh. \" I have my fits of wickedness. In church yesterday, on my knees at the altar, I thought that I was resigned. I almost believed in the heaven where we shall see and know our friends again.\" The dark hour passed, and at sunset, when Vansittart came home from a long day in the plantations, his wife received him with her brightest smile. His coming back after a few hours' absence was enough for a festival. She had spent a day at Fernhurst, and the sight of her three sisters in their somewhat ostentatious mourning had renewed her grief. Eve had sent them money for mourning, which largesse they had spent conscientiously, and so were swathed in crape and distinctly funereal of aspect. There were Peggy's sisters, whose very exist-"], [21, "13 \"FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" ence recalled her image too vividly ; and there was Peggy's room, the room which she had shared with Hetty ; and the little bed where she had slept so peacefully, with her nose almost touching the sloping roof, before the cruel cough took hold of her, and disturbed those happy, childish slumbers, with their visions of fairyland, or of castles in the air which seemed solid and real to the dreamer. Everything in that cottage chamber suggested her who slept in a far lovelier spot. The room remained just as the child had left it. Peggy's things were sacred. There was her workbox, the substantial, old-fashioned rosewood box, inlaid with mother-o'-pearl, and lined with blue silk, the old, old blue, a colour such as modern taste holds up to scorn \u2014 for the box was nearly half a century old, and had belonged to Peggy's grandmother first and to her mother afterwards. It had been given to Peggy because she was the youngest, and the little stock of trinkets was exhausted by the time her four sisters had each received a souvenir. The amethyst earrings, utterly unwearable, for Eve ; the watch which had not gone for years, to"], [22, "14 THE VENETIANS. Sophy ; and a couple of poor little brooches for Jenny and Hetty. After these jewels had been dealt out there remained only the workbox for Peggy. It had been to her a source of infinite delight. What treasures of doll's clothing, what varieties of fancy-work ; kettle-holders, never to be polluted by a kettle ; mats, never finished ; Berlin-wool cuffs, and point-lace handkerchiefs. Peggy had seldom finished anything ; but the rapture of beginning things had been intense, a fever of enjoyment. There were her books upon a little carved Swiss shelf, by her bed. Her lesson-books, thumbed and dog's-eared, everybody else's lesson books before they descended to her ; that \" Grarn maire des Grammaires\" over which the whole family had toiled, and the Primers which make learning easy and people the world with smat terers. There were gift-books, birthday presents from governess or sisters; the immortal Swiss Family, Grimm, Hans Andersen, Bluebeard, Cinderella. How many a summer dawn Pegoy had lain upon that pillow, reading the old fairy tales before a foot was stirring in the house. Her bed was there, with the prettiest of Bellaggio"], [23, "\"FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" 15 rugs laid over it, sacred as a shrine. The little room would have been far more convenient for Hetty if that bed had been taken down and put away ; but no one dreamed of removing it. There would have been unlovingness in the mere suggestion. Well, they had all to do without Peggy henceforward. There was one link gone from the chain of love. Vansittart looked round at his sisters-in-law's faces with an agonized dread. Who would be the next ? Which among that tainted flock would be the first to show the inherited poison, the first to feel the cold hand of the destroyer ? They all looked bright and healthy. They had all the fair complexion and fine roseate bloom which mark the typical English beauty, a loveliness of colour which can almost afford to dispense with perfection of form. They were slenderly made. In a doctor's parlance, there was not much of them to fall back upon \u2014 not much in hand at the beginning of a long illness. They were tall and willowy, rather narrow chested, Vansittart noted with a pang. Yes, assuredly Eve was the flower of the flock. Her"], [24, "16 THE VENETIANS. chest was broader, her throat fuller and more firmly moulded than the chests and throats of her sisters. The poise of her head was more decided, her whole bearing argued a stronger constitution. She was the offspring of her mother's youth, before any indication of disease had darkened the young life. She was the off spring of her father's early manhood. The doctors had argued well for her on this account. - i The winter was spent very quietly at Mere wood. Vansittart hunted and shot, and he often went home earlier in the dusk than became him as a sportsman, in order to take tea with Eve beside the fire. His mother lingered at Merewood, so that Eve should not be alone, the link between the two women strengthening' day by day. The sisters came over from Hasle mere, and enjoyed all the luxuries of a well ordered house. Eve and her husband went for two or three short visits to Redwold Towers, and Sir Hubert and Lady Hartley came to Merewood ; he for the last of the pheasants \u2014 having pretty nearly cleared his\" own woods, extensive as they"], [25, "\"FROM THE EVIL TO COME.\" 17 were \u2014 she for the pleasure of being with Eve, to whom she was sincerely attached. And so the winter went by, a not unhappy, winter \u2014 how could a young wife be unhappy adoring and adored by her husband ? Hymen's torch glowed with gentlest light beside that hearth where the pine logs were heaped so liberally, pine logs from Vansittart's paternal woods. \u2022 Eve was in high health at Easter, radiant, full of life and spirits, albeit in no wise forgetful of that grave on the hill where the Marechal Niel roses were growing so luxuriantly, and which was being carefully tended by stranger hands. There are those at Cannes who take a loving pride iu that Garden of Death, whose care it is that this silent world above the fairest of seas should be for ever beautiful, a paradise of rest, the very memory whereof should be sweet in the thoughts of the bereaved. Eve could think now with resignation of that tranquil spot, and of the young life which had come to a sudden pause on earth. Was it a full stop, or only a hyphen ? Was it the end of the book, or only the bottom of the page, with the last word VOL. III. c"], [26, "18 THE VENETIANS. repeated over-leaf, to carry on the story without a break ? Mrs. Vansittart insisted that her children should have the free use of the house in Charles Street for the London season. She wanted Eve to enjoy the privileges of her position as the wife of a man of good family and good means. She had also a lingering hope that in the high pressure of London society her son might awaken to some worthy ambition \u2014 political or social, and might try to make his mark in the world. She had always been ambitious for him \u2014 had always wanted him to do something more than shoot his own pheasants, improve the cottages on his estate, and live within his means. For a young man of his social status, the political arena offered fair scope for ambition, and Mrs. Vansittart had the common idea that any man of good abilities can succeed in politics."], [27, "19 CHAPTER II. \"SO VERT WILFUL.\" Another Easter over, another season beginning, and with all the usual auguries of a season of exceptional splendour \u2014 auguries to be exchanged later for dismal elegies upon a season of sur passing dulness, and trade stagnation, which had disappointed everybody, and all but ruined the West End purveyors. As this jubilant vaticina tion and these melancholy wailings are repeated year after year, they have come to be of little more significance than the cheerful chirping of the newly arriving swifts under the eaves, or the twittering of the departing swallows assembled for their autumnal flight. Seasons come and seasons go. People are hopeful before the fact, and disappointed after the fact ; the great chorus of humanity goes on. Such is life. A season of hope and disillusion. Contemplate existence"], [28, "20 THE VENETIANS. from the severest standpoint of the agnostic metaphysician, or from the most exalted platform of the Christian saint, and the ultimate fact is the same. We begin in hope to end in sorrow. For Signora Vivanti the after-Easter season began under cheeriest conditions. Her success at the Apollo had been unbroken. The longer she acted a part, the more spirited her acting became. Ignorant and uncultured as she was, she possessed the gift of \" gag,\" knew when and where to introduce a word or a look which delighted her audience ; and the management and her brother and sister artists \u2014 more espe cially the brothers \u2014 gave her full scope. These little inspirations of hers became licensed liber ties, and her role grew and strengthened under her hands. She was the most popular actress who had appeared at the Apollo since the building of the theatre. So at Easter the impresario increased the lady's salary for the fourth time since her debut. He knew what tempting offers had been made to her by managers and by agents\u2014 how ea<-er one was to send her to America, what dazzling lures another held out for Australasia. Happily, la"], [29, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 21 Vivanti liked London \u2014 big, dirty, bustling London \u2014 and was content to make her fortune within the sound of Big Ben, whose mighty voice came booming along the tide to Chelsea when the wind blew from the east. Lisa was making her fortune as fast as ever a young woman of moderate desires could wish to make it. To herself she appeared inordinately rich. The collet necklace had now a sine half hoop bracelet to keep it company in the strong box under Lisa's bed, and she had a number of brooches which studded her corsage like a con stellation. What the outside world said of Lisa's diamonds was very different from the truth ; but the Venetian neither knew nor cared what the outside world was saying. The people in the theatre were all very kind to her. They knew that she was what Mr. Hawberk called \" straight,\" and that the gems she flashed upon the public eye were honestly come by, the result of an economical existence. She and la Zia were able to live upon so little. A few shreds of meat, messed up in some occult manner with their perpetual pasta, which, in various forms, made the basis of almost all their food. A breakfast of"], [30, "22 THE VENETIANS. coffee and rolls; a supper of highly odorous cheese, with sometimes for a festa a dish of cheap pastry from the Swiss confectioner's in the King's Road. Such a cuisine did not make much impression upon Signora Vivanti's salary. She had no servant, except a slovenly female, with depressing manners, who came two mornings a week to scrub floors, clean windows, and black lead grates. La Zia did all the rest, and delighted in her work. To sweep and dust those palatial apartments was a perpetual joy to her, second only to the delight of tramping up and down the King's Road, exploring every greengrocer's shop till she secured the cheapest vegetables, and lamenting the Rialto, where three lemons could be had for two soldi, and where the pale, blood less asparagus was less than a quarter the London price of that luxury. Pleasant also was it to la Zia to take the 'bus for Coventry Street, and to prowl about the foreign settlement between the churches of St. Anne and St. Giles' ; but oh, what a dull and dismal aspect had the restaurants and table d'hotes in this quarter, as compared with the Capello Nero and the movement and brio-ht ness of the Piazza."], [31, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 23 La Zia was happy, but in spite of an altogether phenomenal success, and of wealth that far sur passed her dreams of fortune, the same could not be said of Fiordelisa. There was that lacking in her young life which changed her gold to dross, her laurels to worthless weeds. She had loved, and loved passionately, with all the force of her undisciplined heart, and her love had been rejected. She had steeped her soul in the pro mise of bliss, had told herself again and again that the kindnesses she received from the man she loved could only be given by a lover. Her notions of ethics was not wide enough or exalted enough to comprehend Vansittart's desire to atone for a great wrong, or to understand that so much gentleness and generosity could be lavished upon her by any one less than a lover. She had built her soul a palace \u2014 not of art, but of love \u2014 and when the unreal fabric fell her disappointment had been as crushing as it was unforeseen. After that passionate scene with Vansittart Lisa gave herself up to the luxury of grief. For days she would hardly eat enough to sustain life ; for many nights she tossed sleepless on her bed, sobbing over her vanished hopes, as an undis-"], [32, "24 THE VENETIANS. ciplined child weeps for the loss of a promised pleasure. It was only good little Tomaso Zinco's strenuous arguments which ultimately brought her to reason. La Zia could do nothing with her. She turned her face to the wall, like David, and her long blue-black hair was tangled with tossing on her pillow, and wet with her passionate tears. She would not get up, or put on her clothes, or even wash her face. It was her way of scattering ashes on her head, and rending her garments. Her grief had all the fervid unreason ableness of Oriental mourning. La Zia was obliged to take the 'cello player into the bedroom, and show him this spectacle of angry despair. \" He has deserted her \u2014 the father of her child,\" muttered Zinco, in the vestibule, as la Zia tried to explain the situation. \" That is bad, bad, bad. Very bad.\" \"No, no,\" said la Zia, shaking her head vehemently ; \" it is not that. He has done no wrong. He has paid for her lessons, paid her rent, he has done much for us. Only she loved him, and he did not love her. She is like a child. She will not be consoled.\""], [33, "25 \"SO VERY WILFUL.\" Zinco nodded a vague assent, but did not believe the good aunt's assurance. Of course this man was the father of her child. Of course she had been his mistress. He had brought her from Venice, and established her in these com fortable lodgings, and now he was tired of her. These things always end so. \"Chi va all'acqua si bagna, e chi va a cavallo cade.\" The good little Zinco crept into the room as softly as a cat, and seated his stout and oily person by the bed, where Lisa was lying face downwards, her tearful countenance buried in the pillow, and nothing but a mass of tangled black hair visible above the gaudy Bellaggio rug. He gently patted her shoulder, which acknowledged the attention with an angry shrug. \" Come, come, Cara mia,\" pleaded the singing master. \" Is not this a mere childishuess, to cry for the moon, when we have good fortune almost at our feet? To cry because just one foolish young man among all the men in the world is not wise enough to know that there is no more beautiful woman than us in London ! And not to eat, and not to sleep, and to cry and sob all day and night. Ahime, che bestia ! This is just"], [34, "26 THE VENETIANS. the very way to lose our voice, to become mute as one of those nightingales whose tongues were cut out to flavour the pasta for Vitellius. Was there ever such foolishness ? Were I a beautiful girl with a fine voice, I would be queen of the world. If he has been cold and cruel show him what a pearl he has lost. It is not by lying here and crying that you will bring him to reason. Get up and dress yourself, and come to the piano. I'll wager you will not be able to take the upper C in ' Roberto.' \" Lisa listened in sullen silence, but she did listen, and it seemed to her that the words of Zinco were the words of wisdom. To lose her voice\u2014 her voice which was her fortune \u2014 and to lose her good looks, which alone had lifted her from the herd of peasants, living in penury, toil ing from sunrise to sunset, unknown and ill-clad, and dying uncared for, save by creatures as poor and as hopeless as themselves ! Yes, Zinco was right ; that would indeed be foolishness, and not the way to win him whose love her sick soul longed for. Perhaps if she were a public singer, and all the world admired her, he would admire her too. He would see in the eyes of other men"], [35, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 27 that she was handsome, and worthy to be admired. He would hear on the lips of other men that she was worthy of praise. \"I'll get up,\" she said, without lifting her tear-stained face from the pillow. \" Go into the sala and wait for me. I won't be long. You shall see I haven't lost my voice.\" \" Bene, benissimo, Si'ora,\" cried the master, rubbing his fat little hands, \"now she speaks like a woman of spirit. She is not going to give up the world for love, like Marc Antony at Actium.\" He shuffled off to the sitting-room, seated himself at the piano, and began to play the symphony of \" Una Voce \" with that grandly decisive style of a man who has played all his life in an orchestra. It was a refreshment to Lisa's weary spirit to hear that sparkling music, light, gay, capricious as the summer wavelets. She joined her teacher at the piano in a much shorter time than that in which a young English woman could have completed her toilet, yet she looked fresh enough in her southern beauty, and there were glittering water-drops in her hair which gave a suggestion of a young river goddess."], [36, "28 THE VENETIANS. \" Now, then, sir, play ' Roberto,' and you will see if my voice is broken.\" She attacked the scena with wonderful dash and spirit, and was, in sporting phraseology, winning easily till she came to that C in alt \u2014 but here her voice snapped. She tried a second time, and a third time \u2014 but the note was gone. She gave a cry of rage, and then burst into tears. \"Ecco,\" exclaimed Zinco, with a triumphant air, \" that is what your love-sick nonsense has done for you. You have been singing as false as a prima donna at a cafe chantant in the Boule vard St. Michel, and your upper C is gone. It would have been worth \u00a340 a week to you, but you have thrown it away.\" At this, Lisa continued her lamentation, deeply sorry for herself. \" There's no use in crying,\" said Zinco ; \" that only makes things worse. Bisogna sernpre aver pazienza in questo mondo. You had better dry your tears and eat a beefsteak \u2014 bleeding \u2014 and drink a pint of port-beer. Malibran used to drink port-beer. In one of her great scenes she had her quart pot on the stage, hidden behind a set piece \u2014 a rock, or what not \u2014 and after her"], [37, "29 \"SO VERY WILFUL.\" cavatina she would rush to the back of the stage and drink ; ah, how she would drink ! \" \" I don't want to lose my voice,\" sobbed Lisa, to whom Malibran was but an empty name. \" No. Yet you go just the right way to lose it. Come, cheer up, Siora. Eat much steaks, drink much stout, for the next three days. Andiamo adagio ! Don't sing a note till I come next Saturday afternoon to give you your lesson.\" Zinco's policy prevailed. Lisa fretted sorely at the thought of losing that voice which was to be her fortune. She had told herself in her despair that fame and fortune would be useless without the man she loved \u2014 that she had only wished to succeed as a singer in order to please him. And now she began to see the situation in a new light. She wanted to be admired and famous like the singers whom she had seen at Covent Garden, bending beneath a load of bouquets, while the house resounded with applause. She wanted to be applauded like those famous singers, so that the cruel Smith might see her, and be sorry that he had refused her his heart. Who could tell ? Perhaps seeing"], [38, "30 THE VENETIANS. her so admired, hearing her voice ring clear and sweet through the theatre, he might abandon his tuneless English sweetheart, and come back to Lisa, come back as lover, as husband. Zinco had told her that a fashionable prima donna could not look too high. She would have all London at her feet. It would be for her to choose. Lisa had a strong will, and a wonderful power of self-command when she really wanted to command herself; so she dried her tears, ate British beef, almost raw, and drank British stout ; and under this regime her nerves speedily recovered from the rude shaking which passion had given them, and when the good little 'cello player came to give her the Saturday lesson, her voice rang out sound as a bell, and B natural was produced with perfect ease \u2014 a round and perfect note. \" We'll wait till next Tuesday for the C,\" said Zinco, \" and we won't try ' Roberto ' for a week or so. Stick to the Solfeggi.\" \" And I have not lost my voice, Caro ? \" \" No more than I have lost a thousand pounds, Poveretta.\""], [39, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 31 After this things went smoothly. Life seemed very dreary to Fiordelisa without the friend whose rare visits had been her delight; but life was braced and fortified by a steady purpose. She meant to win the great British public ; and behind that indefinite monster there shone the image of the man she loved. He would go to the theatre where she sang. He would see her, and understand at last that she was beautiful and gifted, and worthy to be loved. \" And then he knows that I love him with all the strength of my heart,\" she said to herself. \" That ought to count for something. Yet when I told him of my love he shrank from me, as if he hated me for loving him. That is his cold English nature, perhaps. An Englishman does not like unasked love.\" Lisa was two years older than in that day of despair, and Zinco's promises had been realized. She had the town at her feet ; and if the coronet matrimonial had not yet been laid there she had received plenty of that adulation and of those advances which cannot be accepted without peril. All such advances Lisa had rejected with a"], [40, "32 THE VENETIANS. splendid scorn. Carnages, servants, West End apartments, and St. John's Wood villas had been offered her ; but she still rode in penny omnibuses or twopenny steamers, or trudged valiantly in cheap shoes. She might have had an open account with any silk mercer in London. She might have had her frocks made by the dress- maker on the crest of fashion's changeful wave \u2014 but she was content to wear a black stuff gown, with a bit of bright ribbon tied round her neck, and another bit twisted in her hair. When she wanted to look her best she put on her bead necklace \u2014 one of those necklaces which the man she loved bought for her in the Procuratie Vecchie on that fatal night. The idea that he had bought the murderous dagger at the same shop in no wise lessened her pleasure in these gifts of his. Among her numerous admirers one only had been received by the lady and her aunt, and that was Wilfred Sefton, who had contrived to establish a footing in the Signora's drawing-room before Zinco could protest against his admission. He had so managed as to be regarded as a friend by both aunt and niece, and the boy, whom he detested, had grown odiously fond of him. He"], [41, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 33 had known Lisa for a year and a half, had seen her often, had spent long summer days in her company, and in all that time he had never addressed her as a lover. He knew, too well, from many a subtle sign and token, that she was perfectly indifferent to him, that his going or coming affected her not at all; that she liked him and welcomed him only because his presence and his attentions made a pleasant variety in the dulness of her domestic life. He knew this. He knew that whatever she might have been in the past, she was a virtuous woman in the present, that she courted no man's admiration, and was tempted by no man's gold. Convinced of this, finding her as remote in her quiet indifference as if she had been some young patrician pacing her ancestral park in maiden meditation, fancy free, his desire to win her intensified until she seemed to him the only woman in the world worth winning. Had she been easily won he might have been tired of her before now. His grandes passions in the past had been of short duration. Unspeakable weariness had descended upon him as a blight ; the loathing of life and all it could yield him. Lisa's indifference gave a piquancy vol. m. D"], [42, "34 THE VENETIANS. to their relations. He told himself that he could afford to bide his time. He had done a good deal of mischief in the world ; but he was not a vulgar profligate. His love was an unscrupulous but not a vulgar love. The white kitten, a thoroughbred Persian, and a gift from Mrs. Hawberk, had grown into a great white cat, stolid, beautiful, resentful of strange caresses, but devotedly attached to Lisa and her boy. He was called Marco, after the patron saint of Venice; and he looked like the white cat of fairy tale, who might be transformed at any moment into Prince Charming. By the time Marco had grown up Mr. Sefton had made himself accepted as a trusted and familiar friend, and in this season of ripening spring, when the lilacs and laburnums filled the suburban gardens with perfume and colour, and when the hawthorn bushes were beginning to break into clusters of scented blossom here and there, it was his business and his pleasure to afford some glimpses of a fairer world to the little family at Chelsea. The holiday which Fiordelisa and her belong-"], [43, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 35 ings most enjoyed was a day on the river. They would have taken boat at Chelsea, if Sefton had allowed them, and would have been content to be rowed to Hammersmith Bridge ; but he insisted on introducing them to Father Thames under a fairer aspect ; so they usually took the train to Richmond, and from Richmond Bridge Sefton rowed them to Kingston or Hampton, where they lunched at some quiet inn, and sat in some rustic inn garden, or sauntered in those lovely old Palace gardens by the river, till it was time to go back to the boat and the train, and Lisa's evening work. Sefton was too punctual and business like to permit any risk of the singer's non-appear ance. He took care that Lisa should always be at the Apollo in time for her work. These days were very delightful to him, even in spite of Paolo, whose attentions were sometimes boring. Happily, Paolo loved the water with an instinctive hereditary passion, the instinct of amphibious ancestors, born and bred on a level with the lagunes \u2014 half on sea and half on land. It was amusement enough for him to sit in the stern of the skiff and dabble a bare arm in the stream, or to watch the little paper boats which"], [44, "36 THE VENETIANS. la Zia made for him, or the great white swans which hissed menaces at him with horizontal necks as they paddled slowly by, sacrificing grace and stateliness in their unreasoning anger. Sefton put up with Paolo, and was happy in the society of two ignorant women, delighting in Lisa's naivete, finding a delicious originality in all her remarks upon life and the world she lived in, her stories of green-room quarrels and side-scene flirtations. Talk which might have sounded silly and vulgar in English was fascinating in Italian \u2014 all the more fascinating in that Vene tian dialect which so languidly slurred the syllables, lazily dropping\" the consonants, and which had in its soft elisions something child like and innocent that touched Sefton's fancy. He took pleasure in Lisa's talk almost as if she had been a child, while those touches and sudden strokes of shrewdness, natural to the peasant of all countries, assured him that she was no fool. He thought of Emma Hamilton, and wondered whether the charm which held Nelson till the hour of death, and made her his last thought in death, were some such child-like spontaneous charm as this of Lisa's, the charm of unsophisti-"], [45, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 37 cated womanhood, adapted to no universal pattern, cut and polished in no social diamond mill. Yes, she had charmed him in their first inter view, sitting out in the chilly tent, amidst the glimmer of fairy lamps. She charmed him still, after a year and a half of familiar friendship. She, the ignorant and low-born ; he, the modern worldling, who had touched the highest culture at every point, strained his intellect to reach every goal, measured himself against every theory of life here and hereafter, and found happiness nowhere. She pleased him all the more because she was not a lady, and made none of the de mands which the modern lady makes over strenuously \u2014 the demand to be treated as a boon companion and yet worshipped as a goddess ; the demand of your money, your mind, your time, your wit, your trouble. Lisa had no idea of women's rights, and she was grateful for the simplest festa which her admirer offered her. Never had a grande passion cost him so little. This girl, who had worked in the lace factory at Burano for a few pence per day, and had lived mostly on polenta, sternly refused anything"], [46, "38 THE VENETIANS. in the shape of a gift, even to a bunch of flowers, if she thought they were costly. \" I like the cheap flowers best,\" she said, \" the blue and yellow ones that they sell in the streets, or the great red poppies la Zia buys, which flame in the fireplace, as if there were a fire there.\" Often, in a casual way, he had tried to get her to talk of Vansittart, but in vain. She would say nothing about him, yet she was curious to know all that Sefton could tell her about the man with whom he had seen her talking. Sefton took his revenge by a studious reticence. \" Yes, I know the man,\" he said, when the subject was mooted in the early days of their acquaintance. \" Do you know him intimately ? Is he your friend ? \" \" No.': \" You look and speak as if you did not like him.\" \" I look and speak as I feel.' \" Why don't you like him ? \" urged Lisa. \" Who knows ? We all have our likings and our antipathies.\""], [47, "\"SO VERY WILFUL.\" 39 \" But if he has never injured you \" \" That is a negative merit. I dislike a good many people who have never done me any harm.\" \" He is going to be married, I hear.\" \" He is married. He was married last summer.\" \" Do you know his wife ? \" \"Yes.\" \" Is she beautiful ? \" \" Not so beautiful as you ; but she has a com plexion like the inside of a sea-shell. You know those pale shells, almost transparent, with a rosy flush that is less a colour than a light.

She is rather like an old Italian picture, of that early school which chose a golden-haired ideal and left your ripe and glowing Southern beauty out in the cold . She is not so handsome as you, Belissima.\" \" Yet he liked her better than he liked me. What is the good of my being handsome ? He did not care,\" said Lisa, passionately. It was the first time she had betrayed herself to Sefton. He smiled, and glanced from the"], [48, "40 THE VENETIANS. mother's angry face to the boy, who was hanging about her knee, unconsciously reproducing the attitude of many an infant St. John. \" Yes, there can be no doubt,\" he told himself, \" Vansittart is the man she loved, and this brat must be Vansittart's offspring.\" Lady Hartley had told him that her brother had been a rambler in Italy and the Tyrol for years before her marriage."], [49, "41 CHAPTER III. THE LITTLE RIFT. It was summer-time in London ; the brief, bright butterfly season, in which the metropolis of the world puts on such a splendour of gaiety and luxury that it is hard to remember the fog and damp and dreariness of a long winter ; hard to believe that this stately West End London can ever be otherwise than beautiful. Are not her hotels palaces, and her parks paradises of foliage and flowers, fashion and beauty \u2014 with only an occasional incursion from the Proces sional Proletariat ? Country cousins seeing the great city in this joyous season may be excused for thinking that life in London is always delect able; and, bored to death in their country quarters in the dull depth of an agricultural winter, or suffering under the discomforts of a"], [50, "42 THE VENETIANS. ten-mile journey behind a pair of \" boilers,\" on a snow-bound road, to a third-rate ball, may not unnaturally envy the children of the city their January and February dances, and dinners, and theatres, all, as these rustics imagine, within a quarter of an hour's drive. Eve Vansittart thoroughly enjoyed the plea sures of a London season ; the jaunts and excite ments by day ; Hurlingham, Sandown, Ascot, Henley, Lord's, Barn Elms ; the ever-delightful morning ride, the evening drive in the Park, with its smiling flower-beds, ablaze with gaudy colour that vied with the scarlet plumes and shining breast-plates flashing past now and again between the close ranks of carriages. Yes, London was brilliant, vivid, noisy, full of start ling sights and sounds by day ; and by night a city of enchantment, where one might wander from house to house to mingle in a mob of more or less beautiful women, and beautiful gowns, and diamonds that took one's breath away by their magnificence. A city of fairyland, with awnings over stately doorways, and gardens and balconies aglitter with coloured lamps ; and gorgeous reception-rooms where one heard all"], [51, "THE LITTLE RIFT. 43 that there is of the most exquisite in modern music \u2014 violin and 'cello, tenor and soprano \u2014 the stars of opera and concert-hall, breathing their finer strains for the delight of these choicer assemblies. There are circles and circles in London, as many as in the progressive After-life of Esoteric Buddhism, and it is not to be supposed that a small Hampshire squire, with a paltry three thousand a year, was in the uppermost and most sacred heaven ; but the circles touch and mingle very often in the larger gatherings of the season, and though Eve Vansittart was not on intimate terms with duchesses, she often rubbed shoulders with them, and for an evening lived the life they lived, and thrilled to the same melodious strains, and melted almost to tears to the same music of Wolff or Hollman, till pleasure verged upon pain, and borne upon the long-drawn notes of violin or 'cello, came sad, sweet memories of the years that were gone. Vansittart knew plenty of people who were decidedly \" nice,\" and these included a sprinkling of the nobility, and a good many givers of fine parties. His wife's beauty and charm of manner ensured her a"], [52, "44 THE VENETIANS. prompt acceptance among people outside that circle of old friends who would have accepted her as a duty, even had she been neither lovely nor amiable. The most enjoyable parties must at last produce satiety, if they come every night, and sometimes two or three in a night ; and there came a time when Eve's strength began to flag, and her spirits to droop a little in the very midst of these pleasures, this paradise of music and Parisian comedy, of dances at night, and coaching club meets in the morning. Vansittart noticed the pallid morning face and purple shadows under the dark grey eyes. \" We are doing too much, Eve,\" he said anxiously. \" I am letting you kill yourself.\" \" It is a very pleasant kind of death,\" answered Eve, smiling at him across the small breakfast-table, where a grilled chicken for him, a dish of strawberries for her, comprised the simple repast, a repast over which they always lingered as long as their engagements allowed, since it was the only confidential hour in the day. At luncheon people were always running in ; or there was a snug little party invited for"], [53, "45 THE LITTLE RIFT. that friendly meal. Dinner was rarely eaten at home, except when they had a dinner-party. \" It is a very delicious death, and I shall take a long time killing. Perhaps when I am as old as Honoria, Duchess of Boscastle, I shall begin to feel I have had enough.\" \"My dearest, I love to see you happy and amused, but I mustn't let you wear yourself out. We must have a quiet day now and then.\" \" As many quiet days as you like, as long as they are spent with you. Shall we go to Hasle mere and spend a day with the girls \u2014 this very day ? No, there is Maud's dinner-party to-night. Fernhurst would be too far. We could not get home to dress, without a rush, if we took a really long day on Bexley Hill.\" \" Fernhurst and the sisters will keep till the autumn, especially as you will be having Sophy here to-morrow.\" \" Yes, I shall be having Sophy \" \u2014 with a faint sigh. \" We shall have no more cosy little break fasts like this for a whole week.\" \"Nonspnse. We can send Sophy's breakfast up to her room, with strict injunctions not to get up till eleven. People who ain't used to parties"], [54, "46 THE VENETIANS. always want a lot of sleep in the morning. Sophy shall be made to sleep. But, for to-day, now ? What should you say to a long, lazy day on the river ? We can take the train to Moulsey, and row down to Richmond.\" \" Too delicious for words. But there is a tea party in Berkeley Square, and another at Hyde Park Gardens. I promised to go to both.\" \" Then you will go to neither. You can send telegrams from Moulsey to say you are seedy, and your doctor ordered you to take a quiet day in the country \u2014 I being your doctor for the nonce. We'll steep ourselves in the mild beauty of Old Father Thames, a poor little river when one remembers the Danube and Rhine ; but he will serve for our holiday.\" He rang for a time-table, found a train that was to leave Waterloo at eleven, and ordered the victoria to take them to the station. \"Now, Eve, your coolest frock, and your favourite poet to read in your luxurious seat in the stern, while I toil at the oar.

The oars dipped gently ; the"], [56, "48 THE VENETIANS. church and village, Garrick's Temple, the gaily decked house-boats with gardens on their roofs and bright striped awniDgs, barracks, bridge, old Tudor Palace, drifted by like shadows in a dream. Eve did not [open De Musset, though the ribbon marked a page where passion hung suspended in tragic possibilities; a crisis which might well have stimulated curiosity. She was too happy to be curious about anything. It was her first holiday on the river, they two alone. \" If this is your idea of resting let us rest very often,\" said Eve. She would not hear of landing at Kingston for luncheon. She wanted nothing but the river, and the sunshine, and his company, all to her self. She would have some tea, if he liked, later; and seeing an open-air tea-house a little lower down the river, and a garden where at this early hour there were no visitors, Vansittart pushed the nozzle of his skiff in among the reeds, and they landed, and ordered tea and eggs and bread and butter to be served in a rustic arbour close by the glancing tide. \" I dare say there are water-rats about,\" said Eve, gathering her pale pink frock daintily round"], [57, "THE LITTLE RIFT. 49 her ankles, \" but I feel as if I should hardly mind one to-day. I feel too happy to mind anything, except a black beetle ; and I am glad to think that those dreadful creatures are indoor horrors.\" They both enjoyed this humble substitute for their customary luncheon. It was a relief to escape the conventional menu \u2014 the everlasting mayonnaise, the cutlets hot or cold, the too familiar chicken and lamb. The tea and eggs in this vine-curtained bower had the most exquisite of all flavours \u2014 a taste of novelty. \" I am so happy,\" cried Eve, \" that I think, like Miss de Bourgh in ' Pride and Prejudice,' I could sing \u2014 if I had learnt.\" \" Your face is my music,\" said her husband, his face reflecting her happy smile ; \" your laugh ter is better than singing.\" \" Oh, you mustn't, you really mustn't talk like that ; at least, not till our silver wedding,\" pro tested Eve. \" You will have to make a speech, perhaps, on that anniversary, and you might incorporate that idea in it. \u2022 What, ladies and gentlemen, in returning thanks for your kind compliments and this truly magnificent epergne, can I say of my wife of five and twenty blissful VOL.

How would that do, Jack ?\" Her clear laugh rang out in the still summer air. No female of the great Bounder tribe could have enjoyed herself more frankly. Vansittart would hardly have been surprised if she had offered to change hats with him. \" Five and twenty years ! A quarter of a century,\" she said musingly. \" I wonder what we shall be like, three and twenty years hence \u2014 what the world will be like \u2014 what kind of frocks will be worn ? \" \" Will the cylinder hat be abolished ? \" \" Shall we still travel by steam, or only by electricity ? \" \" What gun-maker will be in vogue ? \" What kind of lap-dog will be the rage ? \" So laughingly they dawdled an hour away having garden and arbour all to themselves, till after three o'clock, when a couple of Bounder laden boats came noisily to the reedy bank, and their human cargo landed, scrambling upon shore, giggling, exploding into joyous cockney jests, with the true South London twang."], [59, "51 THE LITTLE RIFT. \"Come,\" said Vansittart, \"it is time we were off.\" \" Are you sure you have rested ? \" \" From my Herculean labours ? Yes.' They drifted down the river, praising or dis praising the villas on the Middlesex shore, in haling the sweetness of flowering clover from the Surrey fields ; he leaning lazily on his sculls, she prattling to him, as much lovers as in the outset of their wooing; and so to Teddington Lock, where they had to wait for a boat to come out, before their boat went in. It was the laziest hour of the day, and scarcely a leaf stirred among the willows on the eyot hard by. There was only the sound of the water, and the voices of the rowers, muffled by the heavy wooden gates and high walls of the smaller lock. Suddenly the doors opened. A skiff with four passengers slowly emerged from the yawning darkness, and a voice, strong, yet silvery sweet, broke upon the quiet of the scene, a voice at whose first word Vansittart started as if he had been shot. The speaker started too, and gave a cry of sur prise that was almost rapture. A girl, hatless,"], [60, "52 THE VENETIANS. with dark hair heaped carelessly on the top of her small head, a girl with the loveliest Italian eyes Eve had ever seen, leaned forward over the gunwale, stretching out both her gloveless hands to Vansittart. \" It is you,\" she cried in Italian ; \" I thought I should never see you again ; \" and then, with a quick glance at Eve, and in almost a whisper, \" Is that your wife ? \" \" Si, Si'ora.\" The girl looked at Eve with bold searching eyes, and from her looked back again to Van sittart, Las his boat passed into the lock. Her manner had been so absorbing, her beauty was so startling, that it was only in this last moment that Eve recognized the man rowing as Sefton, and saw that the other two passengers were a stout middle-aged woman and a little boy, both of them dark eyed and foreign looking, like the'girl. When Eve and Vansittart looked at each other in the gloom of the lock both were deadly pale. \" Who is that girl ? \" she asked huskily. \"An Italian singer \u2014 Signora Vivanti. You must have heard of her ; she is the rage at the Apollo.\""], [61, "53 THE LITTLE RIFT. \" But she knows you \u2014 intimately. She was enraptured at seeing you. Her whole face lighted up.\" \" That is the impulsive southern manner ; an organ-grinder will do as much for you if you fling him a penny.\" \" How did you come to know her ? \" \" In Italy, years ago, before she began to be famous.\" They were out of the lock by this time, and in the broad sunshine. Eve ['could see that her husband's pallor was not an illusive effect of the green gloom in that deep well they had just left. He was white to the lips. Sefton ! Sefton and Fiordelisa hand in glove with each other ! That was a perilous alliance. And Lisa's manner, claiming him so impulsively, darting that evil look at his wife ! He saw him self hemmed round with dangers, saw the menace of his domestic peace from two most formidable influences : on the one hand Lisa's slighted love ; on the other Sefton's hatred of a successful rival. The intensity of these apprehensions, coming suddenly upon the happy security of his wedded life, was so absorbing that he was unconscious of"], [62, "54 THE VENETIANS. Eve's pallor and of her suppressed agitation while questioning him. \" You knew her in Italy,\" said Eve, her head bent a little, one listless hand dabbling in the sunlit water that reflected the vivid colouring of the boat in gleams of lapis and malachite. \" In what part of Italy ? Tell me all about her. I am dying of curiosity. There was such odious familiarity in her manner.\" \" Again I must refer you to any organ-grinder as an example of southern exuberance.\" \" Yes, yes, that is all very fine, but Signora Vivanti must belong to a higher grade than the organ-grinder. She is not to be judged by his standard.\" \"There you are wrong. She is of peasant birth.\" \" Indeed. She certainly looks common ; beautiful, but essentially common. Well, Jack where and when did you meet her ? \" \" Years ago, as I told you.

Hotel acquaintances seem as old friends.\" \" How did you come to know this girl \u2014 peasant born, as you say ? \" \" She was in a factory, and I was going over the factory, and I talked to her, and she told me her troubles, and I was interested and The same sort of thing happens a dozen times on a Continental tour.

I should only deceive you if I went into particulars.\" He had recovered himself by this time, and the colour had come slowly back to his face."], [64, "56 THE VENETIANS. Eve sat dumbly watching him as he bent over the sculls, rowing faster than he need have done, much faster than on the other side of the lock. He was ready to lie with an appalling reckless- ness if he could by so doing set up a barrier of falsehood between his wife and the true story of that night in Venice. He looked at her presently, and saw that she was troubled. He smiled, but there was no answering smile. \"My darling, you are not by way of being jealous, I hope,\" he said gaily. \" You are not unhappy because a peasant girl held out her hands to me.\" \"Signora Vivanti has been long enough in England to know that a woman does not behave in that way to an almost stranger,\" said Eve. \" Why did you look frightened at the sound of her voice when the boat came out of the lock ? Why did you turn pale when she spoke to you?\" \" Did I really turn pale ? I suppose I was a little scared at her demonstrative address, fearing lest it should offend you.

Can it be that an irrepressible young woman's greeting could interfere with your happiness ? \" \"It was foolish, no doubt. Women are very foolish when they love their husbands as I love you.

Eve seemed again content ; but her gaiety was gone, as if her spirits had droopedVith the vanishing of the sun, which now at five o'clock was hidden by threaten ing clouds. At Richmond Bridge they left their boat, to be taken back by a waterman, and walked through"], [67, "THE LITTLE RIFT. 59 the busy town to the station. An express took them to London in good time for dressing and dining at Lady Hartley's state dinner. She had a large house in Hill Street this year, and was entertaining a good deal. \" My dear Eve, you are looking utterly washed out,\" she said to her sister-in-law in the drawing room after dinner. \" You must come to us at Redwold directly after Goodwood \u2014 you could come straight from Goodwood, don't you know \u2014 and let me nurse you.\" \"You are too kind.

I am debilitated by pleasures and luxuries.\" \"You were looking bright enough last night at Mrs. Cameron's French play.\" \" Was I ? Perhaps I laughed too much at Coquelin cadet, or eat too many strawberries.\" Lady Hartley had an evening party after the dinner, and it was a shock for Vansittart on"], [68, "60 THE VENETIANS. coming into the drawing-room at half-past ten o'clock, after a long, drawn-out political discussion with a big-wig of Sir Hubert's party, to find Sefton and Eve sitting side by side in a flowery nook near the piano, where at this moment Oscar de Lampion, the Belgian tenor, was casting his fine eyes up towards the ceiling preparatory to the melting strains of his favourite serenade \u2014 And thou canst sleep, while from the rain-washed lawn Thy lover watches for thy passing shade Across the blind, and 6ohs and Bighs till dawn Glows o'er the vale and creeps across the glade. And thou canst sleep \u2014 thou heedest not his sighing ; And thou canst sleep \u2014 thou wouldst if he were dying Yes, thou canst sleep \u2014 canst sleep \u2014 sleep.\" There was a second verse to the same effect, exquisitely sung, but worn threadbare by fami liarity, which Vansittart heard impatiently, watch ing Eve and her companion, and longing to break in upon their seclusion. They were silent now, since they could not with decency talk while De Lampion was singing. There were only two verses. De Lampion was too much an artist to sing lengthy songs, although too lazy to extend his repertoire. He liked people to be sorry when he left off."], [69, "THE LITTLE RIFT. 61 Vansittart dropped into a chair near his wife. The rooms had not filled yet, so there was a possibility of sitting down, and this quiet corner, screened by an arrangement of palms and tall golden lilies, was a pleasant haven for conversa tion in the brief intervals between the music, which was of that superior order which is heard in respectful silence by everybody within earshot, though the people outside the room who can't hear are apt to be troublesome, a sudden buzz of multitudinous voices breaking in upon the silence whenever a door is opened. Sefton and Vansittart shook hands directly the song was over. \" I was told you were to dine here,\" said Van sittart, as an obvious opening. \" Lady Hartley was kind enough to ask me, but I had an earlier engagement in Chelsea. I have been dining with the Hawberks \u2014 the com poser, don't you know. Sweet little woman, Mrs. Hawberk \u2014 so sympathetic. You know them, of course.\" \"Only from meeting them at other people's houses.\" \" Ah, you should know Hawberk. He's a"], [70, "62 THE VENETIANS. glorious fellow. You must spare me an hour or two to meet him at breakfast some Sunday morn ing, when Mrs. Vansittart doesn't want you to go to church with her.\" \" I always want him,\" said Eve, with a decisive air. \" And does he always go ? \" Always.\" \" A model husband. I put down the husbands who attend the morning service among the great army of hen-pecked, together with the husbands who belong to only one rather fogeyish club. But that comes of my demoralized attitude towards the respectabilities. Well, it shall not be a Sunday, but you must meet Hawberk en petit comite before the season is over. He is a very remarkable man. It was he who invented Signora Vivanti, the lady who claimed your acquaintance so effusively to-day.\" \" Indeed ! \" said Vansittart, with a scowl which did not invite further comment ; but Sefton was not to be silenced by black looks. \" Did Mr. Hawberk bring Signora Vivanti from Italy ? \" asked Eve ; and Sefton could see that she paled at the mere mention of the singer's name."], [71, "63 THE LITTLE RIFT. \"I think not. She was established in very comfortable quarters at Chelsea when Hawberk first heard of her. Some good friend plated her there and paid for her training. The rest of her career is history. Hawberk finished her artistic education, and had the courage to trust the fate of a new opera to an untried singer. The result justified his audacity, and the Vivanti is the rage. She is original, you see ; and a grain of originality is worth a bushel of imitative excellence ! \" \" I should like to hear her sing,\" said Eve. \" Then you are in a fair way of being gratified. She is to sing to-night. Lady Hartley has engaged her.\" \" Keally ! How odd that Lady Hartley never mentioned her when she was telling me about her programme.\" \" The engagement was made only two or three days ago, after I met Lady Hartley at Lady Belle Teddington's evening party. It was my suggestion. Musical evenings are apt to be so dismal \u2014 Mendelssohn, de Beriot, Spohr, relieved by a portentous Scotch ballad of nine and twenty verses by a fashionable baritone. Vivanti has sentiment and humour, chic and fire. She will"], [72, "64 THE VENETIANS. be the bouquet, and send people away in good spirits.\" A duet for violin and 'cello began at this stage of conversation, and when it was over Vansittart moved away to another part of the room, and talked to other people. It was past eleven. He knew not how soon the Venetian might appear upon the scene ; but he was determined to keep out of her way. He would not risk another effusive greeting ; and with a woman of her type there was no reliance upon the restraints of society. She might be as demonstrative in a crowded drawing-room as on the river Thames. Of all irritating chances what could be more exasperating than this young woman's appearance at his sister's house, even as a paid entertainer ? And it was Sefton's doing ; Sefton, who had seen him with Fiordelisa two years ago on the Embankment, and who had doubtless treasured up the remembrance of that meeting ; Sefton who had admired Eve and had been scorned by her, and who doubtless hated Eve's husband. Nothing could be more disquieting for Van sittart than that Sefton should have made himself the friend and patron of Fiordelisa \u2014 even if he"], [73, "65 THE LITTLE RIFT. were no more than friend or patron. If he were pursuing the Venetian girl with evil meaning it would be Vansittart's duty to warn her. He had urged her to lead a good life \u2014 to redeem the error of her girlhood by a virtuous and reputable womanhood. It would be the act of a coward to stand aside and keep silence, while her reputation was being blighted by Sefton's patronage. True that her aunt and son had been the companions of to-day's river excursion ; true that their presence had given respectability to the jaunt ; yet with his knowledge of Sefton's character Vansittart could hardly believe that his intentions towards this lovely daughter of the people could be altogether free from guile. He hated the idea of an interview with Lisa ; but he told himself that it was his duty to give her fair warning of Sefton's character. She might have been Harold Marchant's wife, perhaps, with a legitimate protector, but for his \u2014 Vansittart's \u2014 evil passions. This gave her an indisputable claim upon his care and kindness \u2014 a claim not to be ignored because it involved unpleasantness or risk for himself. He went back to Eve presently, and asked her VOL. III. F"], [74, "66 THE VENETIANS to come into the inner drawing-room, where there were people who wanted to see her ; an excuse for getting her away from Sefton, who still held his ground by her chair. \" I shall lose my place if I stir,\" she said ; \" and I want to hear Signora Vivanti.\" \" I'll bring you back.\" \"There'll be no getting back through the crowd. Please let me stay till she has sung.\" \" As you please.\" He turned and left her, offended that she should refuse him ; vexed at her desire to hear the woman who had already been a bone of contention between them. He went back to the inner drawing-room, as far as possible from the piano and the clever German pianist who had arranged the programme for Lady Hartley, and who was to accompany \u2014 somewhat reluctantly \u2014 the lady from the Apollo, whose performance might pass the boundary line of the comme il faut, he thought. Vansittart stood where he could just see Lisa, by looking over the heads of the crowd. She took her stand a little way from the piano, and clear of the audience, with admirable aplomb,"], [75, "67 THE LITTLE RIFT. though this was her first society performance. She was in yellow \u2014 a yellow crape gown, very simply made, with a baby bodice and short puffed sleeves ; and on the clear olive of her finely moulded neck there flashed the collet necklace which represented the firstfruits of her success. Vansittart shuddered as he noted the jewels, for he had the accepted idea of actress's diamonds, and he began to fear that Lisa had' already taken the wrong road. She sang a ballad from the new serio-comic opera, Saroun Alraschid, a ballad which all the street organs and all the smart bands were play ing, and which was as familiar in the remotest slums of the east as in the gardens of the west. \"I am not fair, I am not wise, But I would die for thee ; My only merit in thine eyes Is my fidelity. Oh, couldst thou kill me with thy frown, That death I'd meekly meet, For it were joy to lay me down And perish at thy feet.\" It was the song of a slave to her Sultan, and glanced from the supreme of sentiment, to the absurdity of burlesque. The song was the rage,"], [76, "68 THE VENETIANS. but it was the power and passion of the singer that made it so. The sudden silvery laugh with which she finished the second verse, changing instantaneously from pathos to mocking gaiety \u2014 with a sudden change in metre and sentiment \u2014 was a touch of originality that delighted her audience, and the song was applauded to the echo. Vansittart had moved into the music room while she sang, as if drawn irresistibly by the power of song, and he was near enough to see his wife and Sefton talking to the singer ; praising her, no doubt; uttering only the idle nothings which are spoken upon such occasions ; but the idea that Eve should get to know this woman's name, that they should talk together familiarly, and above all, that Lisa should know his name, and be able to approach wife or husband whenever some wild impulse urged her attack, was dreadful to him. How could he be sure henceforward that his secret should remain a secret ? Was the Venetian a person to be trusted with the power of life or death ? He went back to the inner room, and was speedily absorbed in the duty of attending two culossal dowagers with monumental necks and"], [77, "69 THE LITTLE RIFT. shoulders, and diamonds as large as chandelier drops, to steer whom down a London staircase, past a stream of people who were ascending, was no trifling work. In the dining-room the debris of dessert and the ashes of cigarettes had given place to an elegant arrangement of old Derby plates, peaches, grapes, and strawberries, chicken salad, and/oie gras sandwiches, and to this light refreshment people were crowding as eagerly as if dinner were an obsolete custom among the upper classes. Blocked in between two great ladies, pouring out champagne for one, and peeling a peach for another, Vansittart was secure from being pounced upon by Fiordelisa. He saw Sefton sitting with her at a little table in a corner, as he piloted his aristocratic three deckers to the door. Sefton was plying her with champagne and lobster salad, and her light joyous laugh rang out above society's languid jabber. He hated Sefton with all his heart that night ; and he was too angry with Eve to speak to her, either as they waited in the hall for their carriage, or during the short drive home. Never before had he treated her with this sullen rudeness. She followed him into his den,"], [78, "70 THE VENETIANS. where he went for a final smoke before going upstairs. She stood by his chair for a few minutes in silence, watching him as he lighted his cigar, and then she said gently \u2014 \" What is the matter with you to-night, Jack ? Have I vexed you ? \" \" I don't know that \"you have vexed me \u2014 but I know that I am vexed.\" \" About what ? \" \" I didn't like to see you so civil to Signora Vivanti. It is all very well for dowagers and fussy matrons to take notice of a public singer, but it is a new departure for you.\" \" I could hardly help myself. She sang so delightfully, and I was pleased with her, and then Mr. Sefton introduced her to me. What could I do but praise her, when I really admired her ? \" \" No, you were blameless. It was Sefton's fault. He had no right to introduce her to you.\" \" But is she not respectable ? \" \" I cannot answer for her respectablity. I know nothing of what kind of life she has led since she made her debut. She wears diamonds, and that is not a good sign.\""], [79, "THE LITTLE RIFT. 71 \" She does not look like a disreputable person,\" said Eve, very thoughtfully. \" There is some thing frank and simple about her. That boy must be hers, he is so like her. Do you know if she was ever married \u2014 if the boy's father was her husband ? \" \" I know very little about her, as I told you to-day ; but I should say not.\" \" Poor thing ! I am very sorry for her.\" \" Don't waste your pity upon her. She seems perfectly happy. A peasant girl, reared upon polenta, does not consider these things so tragically as they are considered in Mayfair.\" \"How scornfully you speak of her. I am sure she is a good girl at heart. She remembered seeing me in the boat to-day, and she asked me if I was your wife. She repeated my name curiously, as if she had never heard it before. Did not she know your name when you met her in Verona, or wherever it was ? \" \" Very likely not. I was an Englishman. That might have been a sufficient distinction in her mind.\" \" I hope she is not leading a wicked life,\" said Eve, with a sigh. \" She has a good face.\""], [80, "72 THE VENETIANS. \" Do not let us trouble about her any more,\" said Vansittart, looking earnestly up at the thoughtful face that was looking down at him. \" She has almost brought dissension between us \u2014 for the first time.\" \" Only almost. We could not be angry with each other long, could we, Jack ? But you must own it was enough to take any wife by surprise.

Ah, how can I think otherwise when you have been so indulgent, so dear ? Yet in the past you might have loved that dark-eyed girl. You never pretended I was your first love. And if you did care for her, do please be candid and tell me. I should be happier if I knew the worst.

She will expect matrimonial offers \u2014 to be a success in her first season. Why don't you marry her to Sefton ? \" \" I don't like Mr. Sefton.\" \" But Sophy might like him, and he is rich and well born. If he is not a gentleman that is his own affair \u2014 not any fault in his race.\""], [83, "75 CHAPTER IV. \"POOR KIND WILD EYES SO DASHED WITH LIGHT QUICK TEARS.\" Sophy arrived next day with portentous punctu ality, in time for luncheon, intent on pleasure, and dressed in a style which she believed in as the very latest Parisian fashion ; for this damsel credited herself with an occult power of knowing what was \" in \" and what was \" out,\" and, with no larger horizon than a country church and an occasional rustic garden-party, set up as an authority upon dress, and gave her instructions to the village dressmaker, who made up ladies' own materials, and worked at ladies' houses, with the air of a Kate Reilly directing an apprentice. Eve had been very generous, and Sophy's cos tume was a great advance upon those days when Lady Hartley had talked of the sisters as Colonel"], [84, "76 THE VENETIANS. Marchant's burlesque troupe. Eve had sent down a big parcel of materials from a West End draper's, the newest and the best, and Sophy had exercised her fingers and her taste in the confection of stylish garments ; yet it must be owned there was an unmistakable air of home dress-making \u2014 of fabrications suggested by answers to corre spondents in a ladies' newspaper \u2014 about those smart gowns, jackets, capes, and fichus which Sophy wore with such satisfaction. This showed itself most in an unconscious exaggeration of every fashion ; just as a woman who rouges in evitably exaggerates the colouring of natural carnations. Sophy's Medici collars were higher than anybody else's. The military collar of Sophy's home-made tailor gown was an instru ment of torture. Sophy's waistcoats and sleeves were more mannish and sporting than anything Bedfern had produced for Eve. In a word, there was a touch of Sophy's personality about every garment ; just as in every picture there is the individuality of the painter. But Sophy, flushed with the delights of a London season, was quite pretty enough to be forgiven a little provincialism in her dress and"], [85, "\"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" 77 manners, and she was well received by Eve's friends. It was good for Eve that she should be obliged to exert herself in order to amuse Sophy, and that the sweet solitude of two was no longer possible for her and Vansittart. He said nothing further about his wife's need of repose. He was glad to see her occupied from morning till long past midnight, showing Sophy what our ancestors used to call \" the town ; \" but which now includes a wide range of the suburbs, and occasional garden-parties as far off as Marlow or Hatfield. He was glad of anything which could distract his wife's thoughts from too deep a consideration of his acquaintance with Signora Vivanti, and he encouraged Sophy in every form of dissipation, until he found, to his annoyance, that an evening had been allotted to the Apollo. The fame of Haroun Alrasehid and of Sig nora Vivanti's beauty and talent had penetrated beyond Haslemere, and Sophy had written to her sister imploring her to secure places for an evening during her visit. A box had been taken six weeks in advance, and Eve, who was always indulged in every theatrical fancy, had"], [86, "78 THE VENETIANS. not thought it necessary to inform her husband of the fact. To forbid the occupation of that box would have been too marked an exercise of authority ; to absent himself from the party would have made Eve uneasy ; so he went with his wife and sister-in-law, and saw Lisa on the stage for the first time since he had watched her in the ranks of the Italian chorus at Covent Garden. The box was one of the best in the house, and very near the stage. Vansittart felt assured that Lisa would recognize his wife and would see him standing behind her chair; and with a young woman of Lisa's temperament he knew not what form that recognition might assume. Fortunately Lisa had now become too much of an artist to do anything which would take her \" out of the picture.\" She gave Vansittart one little look which told him he was seen in the shadow where he stood ; and for the rest she was no longer Lisa, the Venetian, but Haroun's devoted slave-girl, bought from a cruel master, during one of Haroun's nocturnal explorations of the city, and following him ever after with a devoted love, watchful, ubiquitous, his guardian angel in"], [87, "79 \"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" every danger, his resource and protection in every serio-comic dilemma. Her singing, her acting, were alike instinct with passion and genius, a genius unspoiled by the refinement of that higher culture which is too apt to bring self consciousness and sickly self-torment in its train, and so to miss all broad and spontaneous effects. Fiordelisa flung herself into her role with a daring energy which always hit the mark. Mr. Sefton was in the stalls, attentive, but not applauding. He left all noisy demonstration to the British public. It was enough for him to know that Lisa liked to see him there, tranquil and interested. The highest reward she had ever given him for all his devotion was the confession that she missed him when he was absent, and found something wanting in her audience when his stall was empty. For the most part he went as regularly to hear Lisa sing as he took his coffee after dinner. The dinner-party must be something very much out of the common run of dinners which could draw him from his place at the Apollo; and people remarked that for the last two seasons Mr. Sefton was seldom to be met in society until late in the evening."], [88, "80 THE VENETIANS. He went to Mrs. Vansittart's box between the acts, and made himself particularly agreeable to Sophy, whom he had not seen since her sister's marriage. \" This is your first season, ain't it, Miss Mar chant ? \" he said. \" What a large reserve fund of enjoyment you must have to spend ! \" Sophy was not going to accept compliments upon her ignorance. \" Fernhurst is so near town,\" she said. \" One sees everybody, and one breathes the town atmosphere.\" \" Ah, but you only see people on their rustic side. They wear tailor gowns and talk about fox-hunting and sick cottagers. They leave their London intellect in Mayfair, like the table-knives rolled up in mutton fat, to come out sharp and bright next season. You don't know what we are like in town if you see us only in the country.\" \" I don't find a remarkable difference in you,\" said Sophy, pertly. \"You always try to be epigrammatic.\" \" Oh, I am no one \u2014 a poor follower of the fashion of the hour, whatever it may be. How do you like the music ? \""], [89, "81 \"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" \"For music to hear and forget I think it is absolutely delightful.\" \"There are some numbers which the piano organs and the fashionable bands won't allow you to forget \u2014 Zuleika's song for instance, and the quartette.\" \" I rather hate all but classical music,\" replied Sophy, with her fine air, \" and I find your famous Signora Vivanti odiously vulgar.\" \"Deliciously vulgar, you should have said. Her vulgarity is one of her attractions. To be so pretty, and so graceful, and so clever, and at the same time a peasant to the tips of her fingers \u2014 there is the charm.\" \" I hate peasants, even when they are as clever as Thomas Carlyle.\" Sefton looked at the pert little face medita tively. She was like Eve, but without Eve's exceptional loveliness \u2014 the loveliness that con sists chiefly in delicacy and refinement, an ethereal beauty which makes a woman like a flower. She had Eve's transparent complexion and vivid changeful colouring, and her dark grey eyes had something of Eve's brilliancy. There was the same type, but less beautifully developed. VOL. III. G"], [90, "82 THE VENETIANS. She was quite pretty enough for Sefton to find amusement in teasing her, although all his stronger feelings were given to Signora Vivanti. He called in Charles Street on the following afternoon. It was Mrs. Vansittart's afternoon at home ; and on that day she could not shut her door even against her worst enemy. Sefton found the usual feminine gossips \u2014 mothers and daughters, maiden aunts and cousins from the country, with fresh-coloured cheeks, and unremarkable faces \u2014 the usual sprinkling of well-dressed young men. Among so many people he could secure a few confidential words with Eve, while she poured out the tea, a duty she always performed with her own hands. It was the one thing that reminded her of the old life at Fernhurst, and those jovial teas which had stood in the place of dinner. She spoke frankly enough of the performance at the Apollo, praised the music and the libretto, declared she had enjoyed it more than any serio comic opera she had heard during the season ; yet Sefton detected a certain constraint when she spoke of Signora Vivanti, which told him that the meeting of the two boats was not for-"], [91, "\"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" 83 gotten, and that the little scene had left almost as angry a spot upon her memory as that which burnt in his. \"And had you really never seen her on the stage before last night ? \" he asked. \" Never ! \" \" How very odd. I think you and Vansittart must have been about the only people at the West End who have not seen Haroun Alraschid \u2014 and yet you are playgoers.\" \" I was saving the Apollo for my sister,\" she answered, perfectly understanding his drift. She knew that he was trying to give her pain, that he wanted to make her distrust her husband. Lisa's conduct had impressed him as it had im pressed her, and now he was gloating over her jealous agony. She turned from him to talk to an aristocratic matron, a large and grand-looking woman, who would have looked better in peplum and chiton than in a flimsy pongee silk garment which she called her \" frock.\" The matron had heard the word Apollo, and had a good deal to say about Signora Vivanti, whose performance she depre cated as too realistic."], [92, "84 THE VENETIANS. \" Dramatic passion is all very well in a classic opera like Gluck's Orphee,\" she isaid authorita tively, \" but that mixture of passion with broad comedy is too bizarre for my taste.\" \" My dear Lady Oriphane, that is just what we want nowadays. We all languish for the bizarre. If we travel we want Africa and pigmy blacka moors. If we go to the play we want to be startled by the outrageous, rather than awed by the sublime.

With us the worship of the bizarre marks the highest point of culture.\" Mr. Tivett was there, and chimed in at this stage of the conversation with his pretty little lady-like voice. \" It all means the same thing,\" he said ; \" Neo paganism. We are the children of a decadent age. We have come to the top of the ladder of life \u2014 life meaning civilization and culture \u2014 and there is nothing left for us but to climb down again.

Our future kings will style themselves Emperor of India and Africa. No other race can stand against us in the game of colonization. We have the dull, dogged courage which conquers the world.\" Mr. Tivett was not allowed to indulge in any further prophecies, for Sophy absorbed him in a discussion about the plays she ought to see, and the music she ought to hear while she was in town. \" You are too late for Sarasate,\" he said tragi-"], [94, "86 THE VENETIANS cally. \" Last Saturday was his final performance. He leaves us in the flood-tide of the season, leaves us lamenting. But there are plenty of good things left. Clifford Harrison gives some of his delicious recitations next Saturday.

I hope you have no horrid dinner-parties to prevent your enjoying yourself.\" \" Only one this week, I am thankful to say,\" said Sophy, who was dying to see what London dinners were like, and was deeply grateful to that one generous hostess who, hearing of her expected visit, had sent her a card for the stately feast to which the Vansittarts were bidden. Eve had refused other dinner invitations during her sister's visit. She made all engagements subservient to Sophy's pleasure. Vansittart was not rich enough to give his wife an opera-box for the season, but he had taken a box for four evenings in the fortnight that Sophy was to spend in Charles Street, and four operas, with different sets of artists, for a young woman who had never heard an opera in her life, was an"], [95, "87 \"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" almost overpowering prospect. It needed all Sophy's aplomb to talk of operas of which she only knew the overtures, and an occasional hackneyed scena, as if every note of them were familiar to her ; but Sophy was equal to the occasion, and discussed the merits and demerits of sopranos and tenors and baritones with as critical an air as if her opinions were the growth of years of experience, rather than the result of a careful study of Truth and The World, sent her regularly by Eve, so soon as they had been read in Charles Street. Sefton joined in the conversation between Sophy and Mr. Tivett, and had a good deal of advice to offer as to the things that were worthy of the young lady's attention ; the result of which advice appeared to be that there was really very little to be heard worth hearing, or to be seen worth seeing. While tea and gossip occupied Eve and her friends in Charles Street, Vansittart had taken advantage of his wife's \"afternoon,\" an occasion which he rarely honoured with his presence, and had driven to Chelsea Embankment to see"], [96, "88 THE VENETIANS. Lisa' and her aunt, and to impart that warning which he had resolved upon giving, at any hazard to himself. It was dangerous perhaps, in his position, to renew any relations with the Venetian; yet on the other hand it might be needful to assure himself of her loyalty, now that she had been brought suddenly into the foreground of his life, and might, at any hour, reveal his fatal secret to her from whom he would have it for ever hidden. All things considered, after two days and nights of anxious thought, it seemed to him best, for his own sake, as well as for Lisa's, that he should have some serious talk with her. He heard the prattle of the child as la Zia opened the door to him, and the mother's voice telling him to be quiet. La Zia received him with open arms, and praised his kindness in coming to see them after such a long absence. \" If it had not been for the discovery that the rent was paid when we took our money to the agent on Our Lady's Day, we should have thought you had forgotten us,\" said la Zia.

She would read nothing but English, in her determination to master that language ; but history was too dull, novels were too long, and she cared only for short stories in which there was much senti mental love-making, generally by lords and ladies with high-sounding titles. These she read with rapture, picturing herself as the heroine, Vansittart as the high-born lover. She could not understand how so grand a gentleman could have missed a title. In Italy he would have been a Marquis or a Prince, she told herself. She started up at the sound of his voice, and welcomed him joyously, pale but radiant. \" Why would you not come near me the other night ? \" she asked. \" I was in your sister's house \u2014 Mr. Sefton told me that the gracious lady is your sister \u2014 and you were there, and you hid yourself from me.\" \" I was afraid, Si'ora,\" he answered, coming to the point at once. \" You know what lies between you and me \u2014 a secret the telling of which would blight my life \u2014 and you are so reckless, so im pulsive. How could I tell what you might say?\""], [98, "90 THE VENETIANS. She looked at him with mournful reproachful- ness. \" Do you know me so little as that ? \" she said. \"Don't you know that I would cut my tongue out/ \u2014 that I would die on the rack, as tortured prisoners died in Venice hundreds of years ago \u2014 rather than I would speak one word that could hurt you ? \" \"Forgive me, Si'ora.

She could not understand your impulsive greet ing, from one whom I represented as almost a stranger. I could not tell her how much you were my friend, without telling her the why and the wherefore. I am hemmed round with diffi culty when I am questioned about you.

Do you understand, Lisa ? \" \" Yes, I understand,\" she answered moodily. Her aunt lingered on the threshold of the door, the boy tugging at her skirts, and urging her to go out. Battersea Park was his favourite play ground. He carried a wooden horse with a fine development of head, but with only a stick and a wheel to represent his body, which equine compromise he bestrode and galloped upon in the course of his airing. La Zia carried his pail and shovel, with which he scraped up the loose gravel in the roadway as blissfully as if he had been disporting himself beside the waves that roll gaily in to threaten .the children at play on the sands. La Zia looked at her niece interrogatively, and the niece nodded \" go,\" whereon aunt and boy vanished. She was always bidden to stop when Sefton was the visitor. \" You need not be frightened,\" said Lisa. \" We are not likely to meet again, as we met on the river. It was so long since I had seen you ! I was taken by surprise, and forgot everything except that it was you, whom I thought I should"], [100, "92 THE VENETIANS. never see again.

Worthy that a man should love her ? \" \" Yes, she is worthy ; and she is fair and beautiful, like the Mary-lilies. I don't wonder that you love her. And she has never done any evil thing in her life, has she ? If a young man had said to her, ' Come with me to Venice, and be my little wife,' she would not have believed him, as I did. She would have said, ' You must marry me first in the church.' She would have believed in nothing but the church and the priest. She was not ignorant and poor, like me.\" \"Lisa, do you suppose that I was making any unkind comparisons? I said only that she is worthy to be loved \u2014 that wall men and women must love and honour her, and that her husband must needs adore her. And now, Si'ora, promise me that you will respect her jealousy, which is only the shadow cast by her love, and that you will do or say nothing that can make her unhappy.\" \" I will do or say nothing to hurt you,\" Lisa"], [101, "\"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" 93 answered, somewhat sullenly. \"She has little need to be unhappy, having all your love. But she is very sweet, as you say. She spoke to me graciously the other night, although she had a curious look, as if she were half afraid of me. Yes, she is very beautiful. Did you know her and love her long before that day on the Lido, when you were so friendly with my aunt and me ? \" \" No, Si'ora.\" \" What ! your heart was free then ? \" \" Free as air.\" \"And afterwards \u2014 when I saw you at the opera ? Wiien you came to our lodgings ? \" \"Ah, then I had seen her, I was captive. I loved her at first sight, but went about foolishly hiding my chains, trying not to love her. And now that we understand each other fully upon one point \u2014 now that I can trust my secret and my happiness in your hands, I want to talk to you about yourself, Lisa. I am not over-fond of that Mr. Sefton with whom you are so friendly.\" \" No more am I over-fond of him. He is kind to us. He brings toys for Paolo ; and he takes us on the river. He is the only friend little Zinco has allowed me to have.\""], [102, "94 THE VENETIANS. \" He gives Paolo toys ? And he gave you that diamond necklace, did he not ? \" \" Gave me my necklace ! I should think not ! Do you suppose I would be beholden to him, or to any one ? Do you know how many bracelets and brooches I have sent back to the fools who bought them for me? Diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires \u2014 all the colours of the rainbow. I just look at them and laugh, and carry them off to little Zinco, and he packs them up and sends them back to the giver, with his com pliments, and his assurance that Signora Vivanti is not in the habit of accepting such gifts. Mr. Sefton give me my necklace ! Why, my necklace is my fortune ! \" And then she told him how she and la Zia had scraped and saved, and lived upon pasta and Swiss cheese, in order to buy that necklace from Mr. Attenborough, who had let her have it a wonderful bargain, and let her pay a considerable part of the price by weekly instalments. It was a bankrupt Contessa's necklace \u2014 a Contessa who had run away fronf her husband. \" I am very glad to hear that,\" said Vansittart. \"I was afraid all was not well when I saw my little Si'ora blazing in diamonds.\""], [103, "\"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" 95 \" Did they blaze ? \" she cried, delighted. \"You thought that I was like some of the singers who spend all their salary on a carriage, and grand dinners, and fine silk gowns \u2014 a hundred pounds for a single gown ! I wanted to buy something that would last, something that I could turn into money whenever I liked.\" \" But your diamonds yield no interest, Si'ora, so they are hardly a wise investment.\" \" I don't want interest ; I want something that is pretty to look at. Did my diamonds blaze ? Your sister's is the only grand house I have sung at. I sing at Mrs. Hawberk's parties, but her house is not grand, and I take no money for singing at her parties. But I had ten pounds for singing at Lady Hartley's \u2014 ten pounds for two little songs.\" \" Bravissima, Si'ora ! There are plenty of drawing-rooms in London where you may pick up gold and silver. There is a freshness about you and your singing that people will like, as a pleasant relief, after a grand opera. But now, Cara, I would earnestly warn you to have very little to do with Mr. Sefton, to keep him at the furthest possible distance. Believe me, he is a dangerous acquaintance.\""], [104, "96 THE VENETIANS. \" Not to me,\" said Lisa, snapping her fingers. \" He is nothing to me, niente, niente, niente ! My heart has never beat any faster for his coming. I am never sorry when he goes. He is kind to Paolo, and my aunt thinks him a delight ful gentleman. He tells us stories about the lords and ladies he knows, and he helps me with my English. He makes me read to him. He tells me the meaning of words, and teaches me how to pronounce them. I should not have got on nearly so fast without his help.\" \" Dangerous help, Si'ora. You are encouraging a traitor. Be sure his kindness springs from no good motive. He doesn't want to marry you.\" \" Do you think I want him for a husband ? \" exclaimed Lisa, with supreme contempt. \" I shall never marry. No one will ever have the right to question me about Paolo's father.\" There was a dignity in this assertion which showed that the unsophisticated daughter of the Isles had made some progress in social science. She knew at least that a husband was a person who might call her to account for her past life. \" I tell you that I don't care for Mr. Sefton ;"], [105, "\"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" 97 but he amuses us, la Zia and me, and our lives would be very dull without him.\" \" Better dulness than danger or disgrace. The man is bad, Lisa, bad to the core. Some men are made so. In the county where he was born, among the neighbours who respected his father and mother, and who most of them tolerate him for his name's sake, he is neither trusted nor liked. Before he left the University, when he had only just come of age, there was a village tragedy in which he was known to be implicated, a tenant-farmer's pretty daughter drowned in the mill-dam with her nameless child. The girl's father was a tenant on Sefton's family estate, as his father and grandfather had beeu before him. A connection of that kind with most young men would be sacred, almost like the sanctity of kindred \u2014 but Wilfred Sefton bad no com punction. He was saved from exposure, for the love that the sufferers bore to his people; but the scandal became pretty well known in the neighbourhood, and the friends of his family who might have pitied him for the awful consequences of his sin, were disgusted by the indifference with which he treated the tragedy \u2014 living it down VOL.

Do you think such a man as that is worthy of your friendship, Lisa, worthy to be admitted to the home of an unprotected woman on a footing of familiarity ? \" \" No, no, he is not worthy. If you tell me to shut my door against him the door shall be shut. But is it true ? Did this poor girl really drown herself because she could not bear to live dis graced ? Are there women in England like that?\" \" Yes, Lisa. There have been many such women. This girl belonged to the yeoman class \u2014 her forefathers had been settled in the land for two hundred years, genuine sons of the soil, respected by their neighbours, and as proud of their good name as if it had been a patent of nobility ; and this girl was young and sensitive. I have heard her story from those who saw her grow up from infancy to childhood \u2014 gentle, yielding, guileless\u2014 an easy prey for an unscru pulous young man with a handsome face and a winning manner. He won her, blighted her,"], [107, "\"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" 99 murdered her. Yes, Lisa, his crime came nearer murder than that dagger-thrust at Florian's.\" \"Don't speak of that,\" she cried, putting her fingers on his lips. \" We must forget it. There never was such a thing \u2014 or at least you had nothing to do with it. It was Fate, not your will, that he should die like that. It was to be. Non si muove foglia che Iddio non voglia. I am glad you have told me about that girl. I never liked Mr. Sefton \u2014 never really liked him. However pleasant he was I had always a feeling that he was hiding something. There is a light in his eyes as if he were laughing at one. He is like Mephistopheles in the opera. It is not in his nature to be sorry for any one.\" \" And you will give him his conge ? \"Yes; he shall come here no more. I shall not let him know that you have told me that poor girl's story. He might want to fight a duel with you, if he knew what you have said of him.\" \" I don't think he would, Lisa ; but it is wiser to tell him nothing. You can say you have been told you are compromising yourself by receiving his visits.\" \" Little Zinco does not love him,\" said Lisa ;"], [108, "100 THE VENETIANS. \" he will be pleased to see him dismissed. He says I should have no friend but him and my piano.\" \"Zinco is a worthy soul.\" \"Is he not? He pretends to be very proud of my success. For the first year of my engage ment at the Apollo I used to give him a quarter of my salary ; but now I only pay him for my lessons. He goes on teaching me grand opera. It broadens and refines my style, he tells me \u2014 but Mr. Hawberk implores me never to leave off being vulgar. It would be my ruin, he says.\" \" Be yourself, Lisa \u2014 bright, candid, and original. Your transparent nature will always pass for genius, from its rarity. And now good bye. I must not come here any more. I came to-day because I felt I had a duty to do as your friend, but my wife would not like to hear of me as your visitor. We love each other too well not to be easily jealous.\" \" It has been sweet to see you,\" answered Lisa, gravely, \" but I will not ask you to come again. Yes, yes,\" she added musingly. \" I understand ! Love is always jealous.\" She gave him her hand, and bade him good-"], [109, "\"POOR KIND WILD EYES.\" 101 bye, with a gentle resignation which touched him more deeply than her impulsive moods had ever done. The beautiful dark eyes looked into his, and said, \"I love you still\u2014 shall love you always,\" in language which a man need not be a coxcomb to understand. And so they parted, each believing that it might be a final parting. Vansittart looked at his watch as he ran down stairs. It was nearly six o'clock. At the bottom of the last flight he met Sefton, who was entering with an easy air and self-satisfied smile, which changed to a frown as he recognized Lisa's departing visitor. \" I have just come from Charles Street,\" he said, recovering himself instantly, \" where I expected to find you But I dare say you have been more amused here than you would have been there. The narrow footpaths and shady woodland walks are generally pleasanter than the broad high-road.\" \" Is that a truism, or an allegory ? If the latter, it bears no application to my visit here.\" \" Doesn't it really ? You don't mean that you, Mrs. Vansittart's husband, call upon Signora Vivanti in the beaten way of friendship ? \""], [110, "102 THE VENETIANS. \" In friendship, at least, if not in the beaten way; but whatever my motive in visiting that lady, I don't admit your right to question me about it ; or \" \u2014 with a laugh \u2014 \" to resort to allegory. Good day to you.\" He ran down the steps to his hansom, and Sefton went slowly up the three flights of stone stairs which led to Signora Vivanti's bower, brood- ing angrily upon his encounter with Vansittart. He had never been able to extort any admissions from Lisa about this man. She had been secret as the grave ; yet he was convinced that her past history was the history of an intrigue with Van- sittart ; and after that effusive greeting from the boat, and remembering the expression of her face more than two years ago, as she hung upon his arm on the Embankment, he was convinced that she loved him still, and that this passion for another was the cause of her coldness to a more eligible admirer."], [111, "103 CHAPTER V. \" AND EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" Although in his leisurely ascent to the third story Mr. Sefton had time to recover the appear ance of serenity, he was by no means master of himself as he waited for Lisa's door to be opened. Still less was he master of himself when the door was opened by Lisa herself, looking flushed and excited, with eyes that were brilliant with newly shed tears. He went through the little vestibule and into the sunlit drawing-room with the air of a man who had the right to enter unbidden, and flung himself sullenly into one of Lisa's basket chairs, which creaked under his weight. \" It is very late,\" said Lisa, evidently fluttered and uneasy. \" I was just going to put on my hat to go to the theatre.\""], [112, "104 THE VENETIANS. \" You needn't hurry,\" Sefton answered coolly. \" It isn't six o'clock ; and you don't come on the stage till half-past eight. You'd better sit down and take things easily. You don't look much like going into the street, with that crying face. You'd better get over your scene with your lover before you go out of doors.\" \" I have no lover,\" Lisa answered indignantly, tossing up her head. In Sefton's eyes she had never looked lovelier than at that moment ; every feature instinct with passion ; red lips and delicate nostrils faintly quivering; a rich carmine glowing beneath the pale olive of her cheeks ; the great dark eyes brightened by tears; the haughty pose of the head giving something of patrician dignity to that uncultured beauty. He was passionately in love with her, loving her with a passion which had strengthened with every hour spent in her company, which every token of her cold indiffer ence had stimulated to increasing warmth. He loved her first because she was lovely and fas cinating in her childish simplicity. He loved her next and best because she, who by every common rule of life should have been so easily"], [113, "\" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 105 won, had proved invincible. The greatest prin cess in the land \u2014 the woman most hedged round by conventionalities \u2014 could not have held herself more aloof than Lisa had done, even while con descending to accept his friendship. She had held herself aloof ; and she had shown him that she was not afraid of him. He saw her now under a new aspect, saw her deeply moved, with all the potentialities of tragedy in those tremulous lips and shining eyes. He saw now in all its reality the passion which informed her acting, and gave pathetic reality to all that there was of sentiment in her role. He saw the moving spring which had made it so easy for her to fling herself into the stage personality, to represent in all its touching details the passion of hopeless love. \"You have no lover? You are an audacious woman to make that assertion to me when I have seen you in his company, after an interval of years, and when each time I saw you, your face has been a declaration of love. I met the man on your staircase just now; and I can read the history of his visit in your eyes. Do you mean to tell me that he is anything less than your lover?\""], [114, "106 THE VENETIANS. \" I mean to tell you nothing. Che diavolo ! You have no right to ask me any questions. What are you to me that you should call me to account ? Signor Zinco said I was very foolish to let you come here. It was only because my aunt and the boy like you that I have let you come. And you took us on the river, which was pleasant. One must have some one.\" \" You will have me no more until we under stand each other,\" cried Sefton, furiously. \" Voglio finirla. I will not be fooled. I will not be duped. I will not be your abject slave as I have been, going night after night to feast upon your beauty, to drink the music of your voice, giving you my whole mind and heart, and getting nothing for my pains, not even the assurance that you are growing fonder of me, that love will come in good time. Do you think I am the man to endure that sort of torture for ever ? \" \"I do not think at all about you. Voglio finirla, io ! I have made up my mind that it will be better for you not to come here any more. We shall miss you and your clever talk, and the days on the river \u2014 but we can live without you \u2014 and as for love, that is over and done with.

The man you love is the man who left you just now \u2014 Paolo's father ? \" He came nearer to her as he asked this daring question; the question he had been longing to ask from the beginning of things. He took hold of her arm almost roughly, and drew her towards him, scrutinizing her face, and trying to read her secret in her eyes. She answered him with a mocking laugh \" You are very clever at guessing riddles,\" she said. \"I have made my confession. You will get no more out of me. And now, with your permission, I will put on my hat. It takes me a long time to get to the theatre \u2014 I always go by the steamboat on fine evenings \u2014 and it takes me a still longer time to dress for the stage.\" She went to the door and opened it for him, waiting with a courteous air for him to go out ; but he took hold of her again, even more roughly"], [116, "108 THE VENETIANS. than before, shut the door violently, and drew her back into the room. \" There is time enough for you to talk to me,\" he said. \" I will answer for your being at the theatre in good time \u2014 but you must, and shall, hear me out. We must have an explanation. I never knew how fond I was of you till just now, when I met that man leaving your house. I was satisfied to go dangling on \u2014 playing at a love affair \u2014 so long as I was the only one. But now that he is hanging about you, there must be no more uncertainty. I must know my fate. Lisa, you know how I love you. There is no use in talking of that. If I were to talk for an hour I could say no more than every word I have spoken for the last year and a half \u2014 ever since we sat together in the tent that Sunday night at Hawberk's \u2014 has been telling you. I love you. I love you, Lisa : with a love that fuses my life into yours, which makes life useless, purposeless hopeless without you.\" He was holding her still, that strong, sinewy hand of his grasping her firm, round arm, his other hand and arm drawing her against his heart. She could feel how furiously that heart"], [117, "\" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 109 was beating ; she could see his finely cut face whitening as it looked into hers ; his eyes with a wild light in them. He stood silent, holding her thus, like a bird caught in a springe, while she struggled to release herself from him. He stood thinking out his fate, with the woman he loved in his arms. In those few moments he was asking himself the crucial question, Could he live without this woman ? Passion \u2014 a passion of slow and silent growth \u2014 answered no. Then came another question, Would she be his mistress ? Was it any use to sing the old song, to offer her the market price for her charms \u2014 a house at the West End, a carriage, a settlement ; all except his name and the world's esteem? Common sense answered him sternly no. This woman, struggling to escape from an unwelcome caress, was not the woman to accept dishonourable pro posals. She had been showing him for the last year and a half, in the plainest manner, that he was positively indifferent to her. She was no fonder of him now than at the very beginning of their acquaintance. Love could not tempt her. Wealth could hardly tempt her, since she"], [118, "110 THE VENETIANS. could earn an income which was more than sufficient for her needs. To such a woman as this, peasant born as she was,'uncultivated, friend less, he must offer the highest price \u2014 that price which he had told himself he would offer to no woman living. He must offer his name, and he must enter upon that solemn contract between man and woman which had always seemed to him an anomaly in the legislature of a civilized people \u2014 a contract which only death or dishonour could break. \" Lisa,\" he said, \" I am not the enemy you think me. There is no sacrifice I would not make to you. You know so little of the world that perhaps you hardly know how much a man of good family and estate sacrifices when he takes a wife who can bring him nothing but his heart's desire. Try and understand that, Lisa. I love you too well to count the cost \u2014 too well to care that marriage with you cuts me off from all chance of marrying a woman whose money would quadruple my fortune and buy me a peerage.

I can give you all things women love \u2014 horses and carriages, fine rooms, pictures, silver, jewels \u2014 and I give you with them all the devotion of a man who has loved many women with a light and passing love, but who never knew what the reality of love meant till he knew you, who never until now has asked a woman to be his wife.\" He released her with those last words, and they stood looking at each other, she breathless with surprise. \" Do you really mean that ? \" she asked. \" Really, really, really. Say yes, Lisa. Kiss me, my beloved, kiss me the kiss of betrothal \" \u2014 holding out his arms to her pleadingly. \" We can be married two or three days hence, before the registrar, and afterwards in any church you like.

Your face lighted, your whole being awoke to new life, at sight of him.\""], [125, "\"EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 117 Lisa shrugged her shoulders, irritated by his persistency, and provoked into candour. \" Suppose I like him and don't like you, can I help it ? God has made me so,\" she said care lessly. \" Ah, here is la Zia \u2014 la Zia whom you would banish,\" she cried, clapping her hands as a key turned in the vestibule door. \" It looked like rain,\" said la Zia, as she came in, \" so Paolo and I made haste home.\" Lisa caught the boy up in her arms, and kissed him passionately. Never had she felt so glad to see him. Her active imagination had pictured herself separated for ever from her son, living in an atmosphere of pomp and powdered footmen, forbidden even to remember her fatherless boy. He had thriven on English fare, and the mild breezes of Battersea Park, and frequent airings upon the Citizen steamers. He was a great lump of a boy, with large black eyes, and long brown hair, and his mother's warm olive colouring. The only traces of the other parentage were in the square Saxon brow and the firm aquiline of the nose. He was a magnificent outcome of a mixed race, and a fine example of what a boy of four years old ought to be. Lisa dropped into a"], [126, "118 THE VENETIANS. chair with her burden, still hugging him, but borne down by his weight. \" Santo e santissimo ! \" exclaimed la Zia. \" You will be late at the theatre. You must take a cab, quanto che costa.\" The Venetians had a great horror of cabs, which were not alone costly, but fraught with the hazard of vituperation from fiery-faced cab- men. They delighted in the penny distances of road cars and other public conveyances. To ex- ceed the limit of a penny ride was to la Zia's mind culpable extravagance. A cab was a vehicle only to be thought of in emergencies. \" Pardon, Signor,\" she said, \" the pleasure of your most desired company has made my niece forget her duties.\" She bustled into the adjoining room, and re turned with Lisa's black lace hat and little merino cape. There was no chorus girl at the Apollo who dressed as shabbily as the Venetian prima donna. La Zia bundled on the hat and tied on the cape, and dismissed her niece with a kiss. \" Zinco will bring you home, as always,\" she said."], [127, "\" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 119 The 'cello lived in a shabby old street hard by, and was Lisa's nightly escort from the Apollo to Chelsea. On fine nights they walked all the way, hugging the river, and praising the Em bankment, which Zinco declared to be as much finer than the Lung Arno, as London was in his opinion superior to Florence. Lisa and Sefton went downstairs together, both silent. He hailed a crawling hansom a few paces from the house-door, and put her into it, without a word. When she was seated he lifted his hat, and bade her good night ; and it seemed to her that there was deadly hatred in the face which had looked at her a little while ago transfigured by passionate love. Hatred of some one ; herself, perhaps ; or it might be of a fancied rival. Her heart thrilled with fear as she thought of Vansittart. Unreason ing jealousy on her account had cost one man his life, and had burdened the life of another man with inextinguishable remorse. Would Sefton, whose love expressed itself with appalling vehemence, try to injure the one man she cared for, the man for whose sake she would freely give her own life ? It would be well to warn"], [128, "120 THE VENETIANS. him, perhaps. To warn him ? But how ? She did not even know where he lived ; but she knew his sister's house, and his sister's servants would be able to tell her his address. She knew his real name now \u2014 Vansittart, a grandly sounding name. She repeated it to herself with a kind of rapture as the cab rattled along the King's Road, taking her to the Apollo. She wrote a long letter to Vansittart next day, telling him that Sefton had offered to marry her, and that she had refused him. \" He is jealous and angry about you,\" she told him, in conclusion. \" He fancies because I was so pleased to see you that day on the river that it is my love for you that made me refuse him and I think he would like to kill you. His face looked like murder as he bade me good-bye \u2014 and I'm afraid it is you he wants to murder, not me. Pray be on your guard about him. He may hire some one to stab you in the street, after dark. Please don't go out at night except in your carriage. Forgive me for writing to you ; but w hen I think that your life may be in danger, 1 cannot refrain from sending you this warning. You warned me of my danger, which was no"], [129, "\" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 121 danger, because I never cared for the man. I warn you of yours.\" With this letter in her pocket, Lisa put her self into one of her favourite omnibuses, which took her to Albert Gate, and from Albert Gate she found her way across the Park to Hill Street. She remembered the number, though she would hardly have known the house in its morning brightness of yellow marguerites and pale blue silk blinds. The haughtiest of footmen opened the door, and looked at her from head to foot with the deliberate eye of scorn. Her beauty made not the faintest impression upon his rhinoceros hide. She was on foot, and shabbily clad, and he took her for a work-girl. \" I have a letter for Mr. Vansittart,\" she began timidly. The footman interrupted her with stern de cisiveness. \" This is not Mr. Vansittart's 'ouse. This is Lady 'Artley's.\" \" I want to know where Mr. Vansittart lives. \" Charles Street. Number 99a.\" \" Please tell me the way.\" The youth came out on to the doorstep,"], [130, "122 THE VENETIANS. moving with the languid hauteur which befitted one whose noble height and well-grown legs gave him first rank in the army of London footmen. He was not ill-natured, but he took what he called a proper pride in himself, conscious that his livery was made by one of the most expensive tailors in the West End, and that his shoes came from Bond Street. Lifting his arm with a haughty grace, he indi cated the side street which would be Lisa's nearest way to Charles Street. She thanked him and tripped lightly away, he watching her with a languid gaze, too obtuse to recognize the brilliant Venetian prima donna \u2014 whose eyes, and shoulders, and diamonds he had approved the other night, when he hung over her with peaches and champagne \u2014 in the foreign looking young woman in rusty black. Lisa found 99a, again a house with flowers in all the windows, and dainty silken blinds \u2014 a house of blighter and fresher aspect than the houses of Venice, where the effects of form and colour are broader, bolder, and more paintable, but lack that finish and neatness which distin guish a well-kept house at the West End of"], [131, "123 \"EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" London : a house where no expenditure is spared in the struggle between the love of beauty and colour, and the curse of coal fires and gloomy skies. Another footman looked at Lisa with the cold eye of indifference, less haughty than Lady Hartley's superb menial only because Vansittart's smaller means did not afford prize specimens of the footman genus. Eve and her husband had to be content with second best in the shape of a country-bred youth of five foot ten, neatly clad in a sober livery, and wearing shoes made at Liss. It had been the Vansittart habit to employ local tradesmen wherever it was possible. \"Any answer?\" asked the youth, as Lisa delivered her letter. No, there was no answer required \u2014 but would he be sure to give the letter to Mr. Vansittart ? There was a rustle of silken skirts on the stairs as she spoke, and two ladies came tripping down, talking as they came. \" The carriage is not there yet,\" cried Sophy, glancing at the open doorway. \" I'm afraid we shall be late for luncheon.\" Eve followed her, and was in the hall in time to see Lisa as she turned from the door \u2014 to see"], [132, "124 THE VENETIANS. her and to recognize her as the woman who had brought perplexity and apprehension into the clear heaven of her life. The carriage came to the door \u2014 a light victoria, with a fine single horse. The footman stood with the door open, ready to hand his mistress to her carriage and to take his place beside the coachman. \" What did that person want ? \" asked Eve, sharply. \" She brought a letter for my master, ma'am.\" \" Where is it ? Give it to me.\" She took the letter, and looked at it as if her sight could pierce the envelope. \" Mr. Vansetart ! \" The woman could not even spell his name, and yet was able to darken his wife's existence. \" What a shabby letter ! \" cried Sophy, strug gling with the top button of a very tight glove. \"It must be a begging letter, I should think. But what a pretty dark -eyed woman that was. I seem to remember her face. Really, really, Eve, we shall be late ! Mrs. Montford told us her luncheons are always punctual. She wouldn't wait for a Bishop.\""], [133, "\"EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 125 Eve was staring at the letter. Vansittart was out, or she would have gone to him with it. She wanted to put it into his hands, and to see how he took its contents; but she did not even venture to keep the letter in her possession till they met. She ran into her husband's study, and put the odious letter on the mantelpiece, in a spot where he might possibly overlook it. If it were overlooked until the afternoon she might be with him when he opened it. She went into society with her heart aching. Whatever her husband's feelings might be, this shameless Italian was running after him. What insolence ! What consummate audacity ! To come to his house, to pursue him with letters, even in his wife's presence ! And Sefton had introduced this brazen creature to her ; and she \u2014 Vansittart's wife \u2014 had been weak enough to be civil to her. Sophy's perpetual prattle agonized her all the way to Grosvenor Gardens ; nor was the smart luncheon which awaited them there less agonizing. She had to brace herself for the ordeal, to smile and talk, and laugh at good stories, pretending to see the point of them ; laughing when other"], [134, "126 THE VENETIANS. people laughed ; pretending to enjoy that happy mixture of society to be met at some hospitable luncheon tables \u2014 a dash of literature and art, a fashionable priest and a fashionable actor, an arch\u00e6ological Dean from a grave old Midland city, a young married beauty, a Primrose League enthusiast, a foreign diplomatist, and a sporting peer owning a handsome slice of the shires. Mr. Sefton came in after they were seated, and dropped into the one vacant chair beside Sophy. \"You are always late,\" Mrs. Montford said reproachfully. \"I suppose that is because you are the idlest man I know.\" He was a favourite of Mrs. Montford's \u2014 Vami de la maison \u2014 and allowed to come and go as he pleased. When he gave a tea-party it was gene rally Mrs. Monttord who invited half the company, helped him to choose the flowers and to receive the guests. \" You have hit the mark,\" he said. \" A man who has no specific occupation never has time to be punctual. Nobody respects him. He can't look at his watch in the middle of a friend's prosing and pretend important business. I think I shall article myself to a civil engineer ; and"], [135, "127 \" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" then when people are boring I can say I am waited for about the caissons for the new bridge. What bridge? My dear fellow, no time to explain ! One springs into a hansom, and is gone. Your idler can't extricate himself from the Arachne web of boredom. His time is every body's property.\" \"Elaborate, but not convincing,\" said Mrs. Montford, smiling at him, as he helped himself with a leisurely air to a cutlet en papilotte. \" I would wager all the gloves that I shall wear at Etretat that you were lying in your easiest chair, with your feet on that high fender of yours, reading Maupassant's new story.\" \" For once in your life you have succeeded as a reader of character \u2014 or no character. I was reading 'Le Pas Perdu.' Don't you see how red my eyelids are ? \" \" Exactly. You are the kind of man who can weep over a book and refuse a sovereign to a poor relation.\" \" That,\" said Sefton, \" was almost unkind.\" Sophy now claimed her right of being talked to. \" Why were you not at Lady Dalborough's last night ? \" she asked."], [136, "128 THE VENETIANS. \" My dear Miss Marchant, you can't expect to see me at all the stupidest parties in London.\" \" The party was rather dull,\" assented Sophy, who until this moment had thought it brilliant, \" but there was some really good music.\" \" One can have that for dirty coin at the St. James's Hall. I adore Oscar de Lampion's love ditties, but not at the price of perspiring in a mob of second-best people.\" \" It was my fault that we went to Lady Dal borough's,\" said Sophy, remorsefully. \" Oh, I forgive anybody for going there \u2014 once. You will be wiser next year.\" His eyes were on Eve on the other side of the table, while he talked with Sophy. She was very pale, and instead of the delicate blush rose of her complexion there were hectic spots under the eyes, which accentuated her pallor. He who once cared for her almost to the point of passion, felt a thrill of pain at seeing in a face a hint of the consumptive tendency which he had heard of about Peggy. \" Those girls are all consumptive,\" some village gossip had said to him, with the morbid relish of gloomy possibilities which is an outcome of village monotony. He was shocked"], [137, "''EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 129 to think that she, too, perhaps, was doomed ; but the thought urged him to no pity for her husband \u2014 not even to that pity which would have prevented him striking at his enemy through her. The rage that burned within him knew no restraining power. If he had lived in the Middle Ages that rage would have meant murder \u2014 but bloodshed in the nineteenth century involves too many inconvenient possibilities to be thought of lightly by a man of landed estate. It means throwing up everything for the exquisite sensa tion of gratified revenge \u2014 melting all the pearls of life into one draught of passion's fiery wine. \" Why is not Vansittart with you ? \" he asked abruptly, still looking at Eve. \" He had business in the City this morning. \" Business \u2014 in the City ? What could take Vansittart to the City ? That seems quite out of his line.\" \" Yes, it does, don't it,\" said Sophy, impressed by the significance of his tone, which seemed to veil a deeper meaning. \" What should a Hamp shire squire have to do in the City ? \" Sefton did not dwell upon the question. He saw that he had awakened vague suspicions in VOL. III. k"], [138, "130 THE VENETIANS. Sophy's miud, the first faint hint of a domestic mystery. He talked of other things \u2014 of people \u2014 lightly, delightfully, Sophy thought. He told her of two marriages which had just occurred, on the very topmost heights of the fashionable mountain \u2014 took her behind the scenes, as it were, and introduced her to the inner life of the chief actors in those elegant ceremonials \u2014 the impecunious father of one bride selling his daughter to a man she hated, the angry mother of the bridegroom in the other marriage raging against the girl her son had chosen. \" You don't know the bad blood which was hidden under those floral decorations and the Gunter buffet,\" he said. Sophy was charmed to hear about these smart people \u2014 charmed most of all at the idea that they were mostly miserable \u2014 that the women whose toilettes her soul sickened for often wore the hair-shirt of the penitent under a gown which Society papers extolled. Sefton was very attentive to Sophy, albeit his furtive glances never abandoned their watch of the lovely face on the other side of the table. Poor Sophy thrilled at startling possibilities. He"], [139, "\" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 131 had admired Eve in the past, had seemed devoted almost to the point of proposing. And she, Sophy, had been assured she was growing daily more like Eve. More wonderful things had happened than that he should fall in love with her \u2014 the old fancy for Eve reviving for Eve's younger sister. Now that the detrimental father had taken up his abode permanently on the Continent, his domestic responsibilities much lightened by Eve's liberality to her sisters, there could be less objection to an alliance with the house of Marchant. Mr. Sefton was completely his own master, without a single relation near enough to interfere with his choice. He had lost Eve by his hesitancy and hanging back. Might he not act more nobly in his dealings with Eve's sister ? That low, thrilling note which he knew how to put into his voice, which was a mere mechanism of the man, touched Sophy's senses like exquisite music. Her eyelids sank, her cheek kindled, though he talked only of common things. He had seen enough of Eve, while thus enter taining Sophy, to be assured that she had lately suffered some painful experience \u2014 a quarrel with"], [140, "132 THE VENETIANS. Vansittart, perhaps. Or it might be that silent jealousy had been gnawing at her heart since that day on the river. No woman could see Lisa's behaviour and not be jealous. The husband would explain, no doubt, but explanations go for very little in such a case. They are accepted for the moment ; wife and husband \" kiss again with tears ; \" and the next morning at the break fast-table the husband sees dark brooding looks, and knows that there is a scorpion coiled in his wife's heart. Her faith in him has been shaken. He may scotch the snake, but he cannot kill it. Eve was glad when Mrs. Montford gave the signal for a move to the drawing-room. The men stayed behind to smoke, all but Sefton, who followed the ladies, a proceeding which Sophy ascribed to his interest in her conversation. At the luncheon-table Eve had been all talk and gaiety, deceiving every one except the man who watched her face in its occasional moments of repose. In the drawing-room she abandoned all effort, sank into a chair near the window, evi dently sick at heart, glancing first at the clock en the chimney-piece and then at the street to"], [141, "133 \" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" see if her carriage were approaching. She had ordered it for a quarter past three. She started up the instant it was announced, and went over to Mrs. Montford to make her adieux, that lady being deep in a murmured discussion of the latest Society scandal with a brace of matrons, all with their heads together, while Sophy was being taken round the rooms by Sefton, to look at the pictures and curios. \" You needn't have been in such a dreadful hurry to come away,\" remonstrated this young lady in a lugubrious tone, as they drove home ward. \" Nobody else was moving.\" \"They will be gone in a quarter of an hour. Only the bores ever linger after a London luncheon. Everybody has something to do.\" \" We have nothing to do till five o'clock ; unless you go to Lady Thornton's at home before five. The card says four till seven.\" \" Then we can go at six. That will be quite early enough.\" \" And what are we to do in the interval ? It isn't half-past three yet.\" \" Rest, Sophy ; sleep if you can. We are going to a theatre to-night, and a dance after wards.\""], [142, "134 THE VENETIANS. \"' \" It is so near the end of the season,\" sighed Sophy. \" People are all talking of German Spas and of their cures. One feels quite out of it when one has no complaint to talk about.\" Vansittart was at home. Eve went straight to his den, sure to find him there, smoking over a book or a newspaper. He looked up at her smilingly, but she thought he looked weary and worn out, and when the smile was gone there was a troubled expression. \"Was it a lively luncheon, Eve?\" he asked, giving her his hand as she took up her favourite position behind his high-backed chair. It was a colossal chair, with broad stuffed arms, upon one of which she sometimes seated herself, liking to nestle against him, yet not so loquacious as to interrupt his reading ; sometimes reading with him ; dipping into some French novel which he read from sheer idleness, not because he had any taste for the thinly beaten gold-leaf of Maupassant or Bourget. To-day she stood behind his chair, silent, medi tative, while he read and smoked. \" Was it pleasant \u2014 your party ? ' he asked"], [143, ":' EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 135 presently, repeating the question she had left unanswered. \" Oh, it was pleasant enough. Sophy will tell you that it was delightful. I leave her to ex patiate upon the people and the dishes and the talk. I was not in a very pleasant mood. There is a letter for you on the mantelpiece. You have not seen it, perhaps ? \" \" No,\" he said, startled by the angry agitation in her tone. \"Is there anything particular about the letter ? \" He put down his pipe and stood up, looking at her inquiringly. She was very pale, always with the exception of that hectic spot which Sefton had noticed, and which burned more fiercely now, the signal lamp of repressed passion. He stretched out his hand to take the letter, half hidden by a little bronze Buddha with male volent onyx eyes. He recognized Lisa's unformed scrawl at the first glance. \" What is the matter with the letter ? \" he asked coldly. \" She brought \u2022 it here herself, Jack, \u2014 that Italian woman \u2014 Signora Vivanti. I was coming"], [144, "136 THE VENETIANS. downstairs while she was at the door. I saw her give the letter to James. What can she have to write to you about ? Why should she bring the letter with her own hand ? How could she dare come to the house where your wife lives ? \" She flamed up at the last question, and her voice trembled at the word wife. \" I don't see why my wife's presence should alarm her, if she had need of immediate help from me.\" \"What should she want? Why should she come to you for help ? Because you helped her once, in Italy, when she was poor and friend less ? Is that a reason why she should pester you now ? \" \" If you will let me read her letter I may be able to tell you,\" he answered gravely. It was a long letter, for in writing to the man she adored, Lisa let her pen run away with her. Nothing would ever induce her to marry Sefton, she told him ; her heart was given to another ; he knew who that other was, and that she could never change. Then came the warning of his danger. Sefton's savage hatred. It was a letter he could under no circumstances show to his"], [145, "\"EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 137 wife. And there she stood waiting for the letter to be shown her, raging with jealousy, the love which had made her so angelic in her self-abne gation now transformed into a fire that made her almost diabolical. \" Well ! May I see her letter ? \" \"No, Eve. The letter is confidential. She asks nothing from me \u2014 except perhaps approval of the course she has taken. She has had an offer of marriage \u2014 an offer that most young women in her position would accept without a second thought.\" \" And she has refused ? \" cried Eve, breathlessly. \" She has refused.\" \" Because she loves some one else \u2014 some one who can't marry her \u2014 but who can carry on an intrigue with her \u2014 an old intrigue \u2014 begun years ago. Some one whom she is trying to get into her net again. The net is spread \u2014 before my very eyes.

A woman in whom I was interested, chiefly because she was friendless.\" \" Chiefly, chiefly,\" she cried, catching at the qualifying word ; \" and the other reason ? \" \" If there was another reason, it had nothing to do with love. Does that satisfy you ? \" \" No,\" she answered gloomily. \" Nothing you can say will prevent my being miserable. That woman has come into my life and spoilt it.\" \" Only because you are unreasonably and ab surdly jealous. You are miserable of your own choice. You have me here, your faithful hus band, unchanged in thought, act, or feeling since the day we rowed down the river ; and yet you choose to consider me false, and to torture your self with vile suspicions, unworthy of a lady, un worthy of a wife.\" \" I cannot help it,\" she said. \" We all have some latent sin, I suppose, and perhaps jealousy is mine. I never knew what it was to feel wicked before. Forgive me, Jack, if you can.\" She took up his hand, kissed it, and then sank sighing into her chair, the chair she had"], [147, "139 \"EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" christened Joan, while his, the colossal armchair, was Darby. \" I forgive you with all my heart, Eve, on condition that this little storm is the last out break. I should be sorry to think our married life was to be a succession of tempests in tea cups.\" \" I promise to behave better in future. I hate myself for my folly.\" Vansittart resumed his newspaper, too much shaken inwardly to court conversation. He felt himself living upon the crust of a volcano. This ceaseless jealousy was a matter of trivial moment in itself. He could have laughed it off, as too absurd for serious argument ; but this jealousy brought Eve to the very edge of that secret which, revealed, might wreck two lives. The horror in front of him was a horror that meant doom. Every step that brought him nearer the hazard of revelation was a step that appalled him. He felt as if he were walking upon the crumbling edge of a cliff. Eve bore with the silence for a few minutes, took off her bonnet, and carefully adjusted the petals of an artificial rose, studied the little fantasy"], [148, "140 THE VENETIANS. of lace and flowers as if it were the gravest thing in the world, then flung it impatiently on to a chair, and began to smooth out her long suede gloves on her soft, silken knee. Her nerves were strung to torture. She had pretended to be satis fied, while the tempest in her heart was still raging. She looked at her husband as if she hated him. Yes ; it was hateful to see him sitting there, silent, imperturbable, reading his newspaper, while she was in the depths of despair. The fact that he had refused to show her that letter seemed almost an admission of guilt. If the thing which he had told her was true, the letter would have helped to confirm the truth. He would have been eager to show it to her. \" Here,\" he would have said, \" under the woman's own hand, you will see that she is nothing to me.\" She brooded thus for about ten minutes, and then her irritation could submit to silence no longer. \"What was the City doing?\" she asked. \" The City which deprived me of your company at Mrs. Montford's luncheon.\" \" It was not the City's fault. I surrendered my place to Sophy.\""], [149, "\" EVERY GENTLE PASSION SICK TO DEATH.\" 141 \"Oh, that's nonsense. There is always room enough and a welcome at Mrs. Montford's luncheons ; but no doubt on a warm July morning the City is more attractive than Mayfair.\" \" Certainly, for those who are making or losing money,\" he answered, throwing down his paper and preparing to be sociable, though there was that in his wife's tone which told him her heart was not at ease. \" What was the City doing ? \" he repeated. \" Buyiug and selling, getting and losing. It is not half a bad place on a summer's morning, though you speak of it with the voice of the scorner. I walked across St. Paul's Church yard. They have turned an old burial-ground into a flower-garden ; and there were nurses and children, and homeless ragamuffins l)7ing asleep in the sun, and pigeons \u2014 tame pigeons \u2014 that fed out of the children's hands. It might have been Venice.\" He started and turned deadly pale. It was the first time he had ever pronounced the name of the fatal city, voluntarily, in his wife's hearing.

Are you satisfied now ?

He was as near fainting as a strong man could be. Eve rushed to a little table, where she was privileged to write her letters now and then \u2014 business letters, she called them, chiefly relating to spending money. Here, among silver orna ments and fanciful cutlery, there was a big bottle of eau de Cologne, which she half emptied over her husband's temples. \"Thanks,\" he murmured. \"You meant it kindly ; but you've almost blinded me. I'm all right now. It was only a touch of vertigo. I've had no luncheon ; and a man can't live upon tobacco and emotional arguments.\""], [152, "144 THE VENETIANS.

Vansittart took a high hand with the woman he loved. There must be no more quarrels, he told himself. He could not control his tongue even in his own interests, if she were to goad him any further.

At this hint of parting she flamed up, her doubt changed for a moment to conviction. \" Part ! \" she cried. \" Perhaps that is what you would like ? \" \" I would like anything better than this mad ness, Eve,\" he answered wearily. \" We cannot be worse than utterly wretched, and we are that now, and shall be as long as you harbour unworthy suspicions.\" His face looked like truth, his voice rang true. She flung herself on her knees beside his chair, and clasped and cried over his hand. \" I will not torment you.

If there is a blue chamber in your life, I won't tease you for the key of it.\" \" That's my own good wife.

I hate myself for my mad jealousy. You have found the ugly spot in my character, Jack.

A thrill of fear ran through him at the thought of her fragility, too frail a sapling to stand firm against the storms of life. \" God keep her from knowing the truth,\" he prayed dumbly, as she hung upon his breast. \" It would break her heart.\" After this there came a halcyon interval. Eve was satisfied, convinced that she was beloved, and what more could a woman want in this world ? There was only one thing that stood in the way of perfect peace. Vansittart had business in the City on two other mornings, and those disappear ances Citywards worried her. The City, as Sefton had said, was not in her husband's line. When she questioned him about the business that drew him eastward he answered lightly that he went to his stockbrokers to make some small changes in his investments. That very lightness of his, which was meant to spare her a serious anxiety, awakened her suspicions. The actual cause of Vansittart's unusual interest in the money market was sufficiently serious. A panic"], [156, "148 THE VENETIANS. had occurred in some South American Railway Stock from which some part of his income was derived, and he was watching the market and the tide of affairs in Brazil, waiting the hour when it might be needful to sell out and snatch the remnant of his capital, or the turn of the tide which should justify his holding on and hoping for a renewal of the good days gone. To this end he went to his stockbroker's every day, and heard the latest news, the last opinions, dawdling in the office, hearing the wise men of the East and their counsel. The hazards, the suspense, excited him. He grew interested in the money market, and felt all the gambler's keen ness. The City drew him like the loadstone rock that took the nails out of Sinbad's ship. It was better than Monte Carlo. A third of his fortune trembled in the balance. He would not tell Eve the whole truth, believing that it would worry her into a fever. She would exaggerate this fear as she had exaggerated her jealous doubts. She would fore see beggary, and be haunted by nightmare dreams of houselessness and starvation. He did not know that to a woman money-troubles are the"], [157, "149 \"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" lightest of all woes. A husband suspected of infidelity, a child down with measles, will afflict the average woman more than the loss of a fortune. Sophy was enjoying herself to her uttermost capacity of enjoyment. This was life indeed. It was the last week of the season, the week before Goodwood, and there was a sense of the end of all things in the air. A good many of the people who were not going to Goodwood were going away, starting for Homburg, Marienbad, Wildbad, Auvergne, or the Pyrenees, in advance of the universal rush which would make sleeping-cars impossible, and travelling odious. It annoyed Sophy to hear people talk of getting away ; as if London were worn out and done with, London which she was enjoying so intensely. This was the fly in the ointment for Sophy. She felt aggrieved that her sister should have invited her at the end of the season. Yet there was one compensating delight. The sales were on : those delicious drapery sales, which had always been Sophy's highest ideal of earthly happiness, even when her strained resources had compelled her"], [158, "150 THE VENETIANS. to turn with unsatisfied longing from a counter where odd lengths of silk and velvet were being all but given away. She had lain broad awake in her attic chamber at Fernhurst regretting those bargains, which would have made her a richly dressed woman at the most moderate cost. The counters of Marshall, and Debenham, and Robinson, and Lewis, at the end of the season, were to Sophy as the board of green cloth to the gambler. She felt that fortunes were to be won for those who had money to stake, fifteen guinea frocks for three pounds, two guinea parasols at nine and eleven-pence. Eve took her sister to the sales, and financed the situation. With a judicious expenditure of twenty pounds Sophy secured treasures that would last her through the coming autumn and winter, and, with Eve at her elbow, resisted the allurements of unsuitable finery. These shopping mornings were rapture to Sophy, and not without pleasure to Eve. It was pleasant to see Sophy's joyous excitement, as she hung tremulously be tween two fabrics which the shopman exhibited for her choice \u2014 a bengaline at three and nine pence, which had been seven shillings \u2014 a watered"], [159, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 151 silk at two and eleven-pence which had been eight and sixpence. After intense consideration Sophy settled on the watered silk, not because she liked it best, but because of the \" had been.\" The original price decided her \u2014 not taking into account that the price was reduced in the exact ratio of the material's unfashionableness, and that she might find herself next winter the only young woman in watered silk. There was for Eve also the pleasure of buying presents for Jenny and Hetty, the two sisters who were pining in their rustic bower, while Sophy was draining the wine-cup of London gaities. It was delightful to Eve to feel that a few pounds could buy them happiness : and she brought all her knowledge of good and evil to bear upon her selections for those absent ones. \"You have such a very quiet taste,\" said Sophy, rather regretfully. \" I call those cottons and foulards you have chosen almost dowdy.\" \" You won't think so when you see them made up. I'm afraid your scarlet pongee will look rather too showy for country lanes.\" \"My dear Eve, I shall keep it for garden parties till it begins to get shabby. Scarlet"], [160, "152 THE VENETIANS. gives just the right touch of colour in a land- scape.\" \"Yes, but I think one would always rather that somebody else should give the touch.\" \"Mr. Sefton said yesterday that fair-haired women should wear scarlet.\" Mr. Sefton was Sophy's great authority. He had been very polite to her, very pleasant, very confidential, talking to her about London society as if she were to the manner born, and had been brought up in the very midst of these people whom she saw to-day for the first time. This flattered her ; indeed, his whole speech was made up of flattery, that subtle adulation which did not express itself in mere words, but which was indicated rather by a deference to her opinion, a quickness in laughing at her little jokes, an acceptance of her as on his own intellectual level. \" You and I know better than the common herd,\" was expressed in all his conversation with her. When they met in the evening it was only natural she should tell him her sister's plans for the next day, whether they were going to spend the morning in the park or at the picture-galleries. Sophy was eager for picture-seeing when there"], [161, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 153 was nothing better to be done. Those galleries would give her so much to talk about at autumn tea-parties, such a superior air among women who thought they did a great deal for art when they fatigued themselves at the Royal Academy. If they sat in the Park for an hour or so before luncheon Sefton contrived to find them there \u2014 if they were picture-seeing he dropped into the gallery, and criticized the pictures in a delight fully technical manner which provided Sophy with a treasury of art phrases especially adapted for country use. If they were at a theatre in the evening he was there too. Eve warned Sophy that he was only a philanderer. \" You remember how disagreeably attentive he was to me,\" she said, reddening at the recollec tion, \" and yet, you see, he never meant anything.\" \"We were worse detrimentals then than we are now,\" argued Sophy. \" Your marriage has altered our position, and now that the father lives abroad a man need not be afraid of marry ing one of his daughters. I don't mean to say that Mr. Sefton is going to make me an offer ; but he is certainly very attentive.\" \" Yes, he is very attentive, I admit. He likes"], [162, "154 THE VENETIANS. being attentive to girls. Nothing pleases him better than to try the effect of that musical voice of his, and his nicely chosen phrases, upon any girl who will listen to him \u2014 like Orpheus leading the brute beasts with his lyre. I doubt if he cares any more for the girls than Orpheus cared for the beasts. He is false for falsehood's sake.\" \"You are very bitter against him, Eve,\" retorted Sophy. \" Yet I dare say you would have married him if he had asked you.\" \" I think not.\" \" Oh, nonsense. You would not have refused to be mistress of the Manor. Merewood is a hovel in comparison.\" \" Merewood has the man I love for master. If Jack had been the lodge-keeper I would have married him, and washed and cooked and mended for him, and opened the gate and curtsied to the gentry, and been happy.\" \" Bosh ! \" said Sophy, very angry. \" That's the way girls talk when they are first engaged. It sounds ridiculously sentimental from an old married woman like you. You are absurdly pre judiced against Mr. Sefton.\" \"Call it prejudice, if you like. I call it"], [163, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 155 instinct. Birds are prejudiced against cats. I look upon Mr. Sefton as my natural enemy.\" \" And I suppose, if he calls, you will be uncivil, and spoil my chances ? \" \"No, I will not spoil your chances \u2014 such as they are.\" \" How disagreeably you say that. One would think you were jealous of an old admirer.\" \"No, I am not jealous; only I don't like to see you duped by attentions that mean nothing. I have no doubt Mr. Sefton does admire you \u2014 I only fear his admiration is worthless \u2014 but I will do everything that a sister can do to encourage him.\" After this conversation Eve was particularly polite to Mr. Sefton. Poor Sophy was so terribly in earnest in her desire to make a good marriage. The elder sister's success had been so rapid and so startling, so easy a conquest, so delightful a settlement in life, that it was natural the younger sister should cherish hopes on her own account. People told Sophy that she was growing more and more like Eve. Hope's flattering tale told her that she was quite as pretty, while vanity suggested that she had more savoir faire. Poor"], [164, "156 THE VENETIANS. Sophy had always prided herself upon her savoir faire, though how a quality which is, as it were, the final polish produced by society friction, could have been acquired by a young lady in a cottage at Fernhurst, must needs remain a mystery. Eve looked at her sister, and saw that she was prettier than the ruck of girls to be met in a London season. Her beauty had the dewy freshness that comes of a rustic rearing ; her eyes were brighter than the eyes of the hardened fashionable belle. Her complexion had the delicacy of colouring which was characteristic of Colonel Marchant's daughters \u2014 which had been, alas ! Peggy's chief beauty. Sophy, dressed as Eve had dressed her, and with her somewhat rebellious hair treated artisti cally by the skilful Benson, was certainly a very attractive young woman ; and it seemed to Eve not impossible that Sefton, beginning the flirtation without any serious aim, might end by asking Sophy to be his wife. He was entirely his own master, could marry to please himself, without consideration of worldly advantage ; only, un happily, those are just the men who generally marry for self-aggrandizement rather than for"], [165, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 157 simple inclination. It is not as if all heiresses were hideous or disagreeable, ignorant or under bred. Even England can furnish richly dowered young women who are both handsome and amiable; so why, asks the youthful peer or landowner, should I marry some portionless beauty, when I may as easily add to my revenue or treble my acreage? The original possessor considers his estate as the nucleus of a great property, which he and each successive holder should increase by judicious alliances ; until the rolling mass swells into a territory like the duchy of Cleveland, and its acres are reckoned by thousands. Eve had heard the mothers and fathers talk of their sons' views and duties, even if the sons themselves did not openly avow their intention of marrying to better themselves. The only hope in Sophy's case lay in a certain eccentricity of temper in Mr. Sefton which might show itself in a disadvantageous marriage. The very fact that he had remained so long a bachelor indicated that he was not eager for a prize in the matrimonial market. He had been content to stand by and see many prizes carried off by men who were personally and socially his inferiors."], [166, "158 THE VENETIANS. He had been a frequent visitor in Charles Street since Sophy's arrival. Her liveliness evi dently pleased him ; they were always talking and laughing in corners wherever they met, and seemed to have worlds to say to each other. \" It is delightful to meet any one so fresh as your sister at the end of the season,\" he explained to Eve, \"just when most of us are feeling dull and jaded, and almost ready to yawn in each other's faces, like my lord and my lady in the ' Marriage a la Mode.' \" He invited Mrs. Vansittart and her sister to a tea-party, given in honour of Sophy, who had ex pressed an ardent desire to see the house in Tite Street \u2014 the bachelor den which little Mr. Tivett had described to her in glowing colours. Eve hesitated about accepting the invitation, knowing that her husband disliked Sefton as much as she did herself ; but the hesitation was overcome by- Sophy's arguments. \" He is giving the party on purpose for me,\" she pleaded. \" The invitation arose out of my wish to see his library, which Mr. Tivett had been praising. He could not pay me a more marked attention, could he now ? \""], [167, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 159 \" It is certainly an attention,\" assented Eve, greatly troubled by Sophy's sanguine hopes, so likely to end in disappointment and humiliation. \" Don't spoil all my chances by refusing,\" urged Sophy. \" He would be offended \u2014 and men are so easily choked off.\" \" Not a man who is really in earnest.\" \"Perhaps not \u2014 but he may not be quite in earnest yet. He may not have made up his mind. Of course I should be a very bad match. He cannot forget that all at once. There is a stage in which a man who is inclined to fall in love lets himself drift, don't you know, Eve ? He may be drifting \u2014 and it would be a pity to discourage him.\" Every woman is at heart a matchmaker. Eve yielded, and accepted Mr. Sefton's invitation for five o'clock tea and a little music. \" Shall you have any singing ? \" she asked, with a sudden fear of meeting Signora Vivanti. No \u2014 there would be no singing. \"I only asked the American banjo man to amuse you,\" said Mr. Sefton. \" He is a capital fellow, and he does the most wonderful things with his banjo. He is a Paganini among banjoists."], [168, "160 THE VENETIANS. That, with the inevitable piano, will be more than enough music.\" The afternoon, at the end of a brilliant July, was delightful, and the Embankment, with its red-brick palaces and its little bit of old Chelsea, looked just the one perfect place in which to live; to live an idle, artistic life, bien intendu, and bask in sunshine reflected from blue water. The tide was at the flood, the gardens were full of gaudy July flowers. \" How horrid Fernhurst will be after this ! \" sighed Sophy. \" What a lucky man Mr. Sefton is to have a house in Tite Street, as well as the Manor ! \" \" Ah, but it is only a bachelor den, remember,\" said Eve. \"He will do away with it when he marries.\" \" Not if his wife has any sense \u2014 unless she makes him change it for a larger house facing the river.\" Mr. Sefton's house was near the corner, and commanded a side-long view of the Thames from all the front windows, and a still better view from an oriel in the library, which projected so as to rake the street. Sophy thought this small house"], [169, "161 \"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" in Tite Street, with its rich and sombre furniture and subdued colouring, quite the most enchant ing house she had ever entered, second only to the Manor House itself, which she had seen some years before on the never-to-be-forgotten occasion of a Primrose League garden-party given by Mr. Sefton in the interests of the cause. The Manor House and its splendours of art, its old gardens, and antique furniture were the growth of cen turies, and owed their existence to Seftons who were dust. This twelve-roomed house in Tite Street was an emanation of the man himself. His temperament, his education, his tastes were all embodied here. This was the pleasure dome which he had built for himself \u2014 this was his palace of art. She went from dining-room to library escorted by Mr. Tivett, who expatiated and explained to his heart's content, pointing out the exquisite workmanship of a table which made mahogany precious as jasper or ivory ; the artistic form of those high-backed chairs, copied from an old French model ; the Gobelin tapestry, which had neither the glow nor sheen of silken fabrics, and yet was six times as costly. vol. in. M"], [170, "162 THE VENETIANS. \" This house of Sefton's just serves to remind one of what a parvenu's house is not,\" said little Tivett, sententiously. Sophy looked at the titles of the books. How ignorant they made her feel ! There was hardly one that she had ever seen before ; and yet no doubt they were the very cream of classic and modern literature, not to have read which stamped one as illiterate. \" I have been looking at your books,\" she said, when Sefton came in with Eve. \" They are too lovely.\" \" Rather nicely bound, aren't they ? \" he said, smiling gently at her enthusiasm. \" They are a somewhat scratch collection, not quite family literature; but those vellum bindings with the blue labels give a nice tone of colour against the prevailing brown.\" \"That is so like Sefton,\" said Mr. Tivett. \" He values his books from an \u00e6sthetic stand point. Thinks of the effect of their bindings, not of the literature inside.\" \" As one gets older reading becomes more and more impossible. There is a satisfaction in possessing books, but one's chief pleasure is in"], [171, "163 \"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" their outsides. I sit here sometimes after mid night, smoking the pipe of the lotus-eater and looking at my bindings, and I feel as if that were enough for culture.\" \"I dare say that is quite the pleasantest way of enjoying a library,\" said Mr. Tivett, as if he saw the matter suddenly in a new light. \" Of course it is. There's no use in thinking of the lifetime it would need to read all the great books. That way madness lies. De Quincey went into the question once arith metically, and to read his bare statement is distraction. I think it was that calculation of his which first put me off reading.\" \" Then your books are only ornaments ? \" said Sophy, disappointed. \" My books are a dado by Riviere and Zaens dorf. There are a great many of them with the leaves unopened. I take out a volume now and then, and peep between the pages. One gets the best of a book that way \u2014 the flavour without the substance of the author. But I came to take you down to tea, Miss Marchant. My banjoist has arrived, and Lady Hartley and Mrs. Montford are doing all they can to spoil him.\""], [172, "164 THE VENETIANS. \"Is Lady Hartley here? How nice!\" ex claimed Sophy, to whom Lady Hartley's dress, manners, and way of thinking were a continual study. Eve's sister-in-law was Sophy's ideal fine lady. \"Lady Hartley is always nice to me,\" replied Sefton. \" She never misses one of my afternoons if she is in town. She would sacrifice the Marl borough House garden-party for my tea and muffins.\" \" Ah, but I dare say you contrive to make your tea-parties exceptional. This banjoist, now Everybody is dying to hear him.\" They went down to tea, which was served in a little bit of a room at the back of the dining room, from which it was divided only by a curtain of old Italian tapestry ; a mere alcove in which eight or ten people made a mob. Flowers, ices, tea, chocolate, cakes, china, silver, damask embroidered by industrious Bavarians, every thing was the choicest of its kind; and Mr. Sefton's valet, with a footman and a smart parlour-maid, waited admirably. The squeezi ness of the room made the entertainment all the more enjoyable. The banjoist stood in the centre"], [173, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 165 of the crowd, talking in the true American style, with an incisive cleverness, and that clear metallic speech which made the average British articulation sound slipshod and slovenly. People were amused and delighted. He told anecdotes, firing them off as fast as the crackers which aggressive street boys explode on the pavement. The admiring circle forgot that his distinction was the banjo, and began to accept him as a wit. Mrs. Montford asked him to lunch ; Lady Hartley booked him for her next cosy little dinner. After tea they all trooped up the narrow stair case to the library which had to serve Mr. Sefton for a drawing-room. More people dropped in \u2014 neighbours, most of them, including Mr. Haw berk, the composer, and his wife \u2014 and the room filled before the banjoist began to play. He played wonderfully, surprising the metallic instrument into melodious utterances. He sang and accompanied himself; he played in a con certante duet for banjo and piano \u2014 a delightful arrangement of the serenade from Don Giovanni, in which the banjo was now the melody, and now the accompaniment; he played on his banjo"], [174, "166 THE VENETIANS. with a bow, as if it had been a violin, and produced an effect which was remarkable, although somewhat distressing. His banjo laughed; his banjo cried; and with those wail ing notes there stole over the senses of the listeners a dream of weary Ethiopians resting after their day of toil in the rank verdure beside some broad Virginian river. Mr. Sefton's visitors, M-ho were chiefly femi nine, flocked round the American, praising and descanting upon his talent. Little Tivett went about explaining, after his wont. He talked as if he had invented the banjoist. \" Did you really know him in America ? \" inquired Mrs. Montford, deluded by this little way of Mr. Tivett's. \" No, no ; I was never in America in my life ; but I knew him when first he came to London, before people began to talk about him. I told him what a hit he was going to make.\" While Society was prostrating itself before a novel entertainer, Mr. Sefton and Sophy had drifted through the curtained archway to the little back room, which seemed, from its small ness, a kind of inner temple, where the treasures"], [175, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 167 of the house might be found ; as in the smallest rooms in old Italian palaces one looks for the most precious gems of art. Sophy was talking and laughing with her host, radiant and happy. This tea-party seemed to her full of meaning. It was assuredly given for her pleasure. Mr. Sefton had said so. She had expressed a curiosity about his small house in Chelsea, and he had said instantly, \" You must come and see it. I will ask some people to tea.\" What more could a man do for the woman he meant to marry ? Sophy was intoxi cated with this delicate token of subjugation. She imagined herself looked at and talked about as the future Mrs. Sefton. Unconsciously she gave herself some small airs of an affianced wife \u2014 chiding him ; making little jokes at his expense ; pretending to underrate his surround* ings \u2014 the pretty childish graces and little pettish tricks which cume naturally to the weaker sex before marriage, as if they were taking payment in advance for the tyranny they are to suffer afterwards. They sauntered into the inner room, brushing against the tapestry curtains, and one glance at"], [176, "168 THE VENETIANS. the sanctuary sent the blood to Sophy's cheeks in a hot, angry blush. The most prominent position in the room was filled by an easel draped with orange and gold brocade, and on the easel appeared a full-length portrait of Signora Vivanti in her character of \" Fanchonette.\" It was a dainty sketch in water-colours, suggested by a photograph, but with all the grace and power of a picture painted from the living model. The painter had caught the fire and sparkle of the Italian face, the richness of colouring, the wealth of a somewhat vulgar beauty. The photographer had seized a happy attitude of graceful abandon \u2014 not a photo grapher's pose. She was seated, lolling in her chair, with averted shoulder, and looking backward out of the picture with a most provoking smile \u2014 Fanchonette's smile of daring and defiance, which had taken the town by storm. The laced velvet bodice set off the bust and shoulders in all their beauty, the blue and white striped petticoat was short enough to show the well-shaped leg and large useful foot in scarlet"], [177, "169 \"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" stocking and neat buckled shoe. A grisette's little white muslin cap sat airily upon the splendid coils of blue-black hair. Beauty of the plebeian type could go no further. Eyes, hair, complexion, figure, all were perfect ; and over and above all there was the charm of mutinous lip and flashing smile, a look that was bold with out immodesty, the frank outlook of a nature unacquainted with guile. Sefton watched Sophy's face as she stared at the portrait, and the pinched lips, the sickly pallor, smote him with a sudden remorse. He had been fooling this rustic for his own purposes, making her an instrument in his scheme of evil. He felt that he had gone too far. Poor harm less simpleton ! What had she done that he should give her pain ? Eve had slighted him ; Eve's husband had come between him and the woman who was his passion ; but this simpering, chattering, giggling girl had done him no wrong ; and it was a base treachery to have deluded her with flattering speeches and meaningless atten tions. However, the harm was done, done with deliberate purpose ; and he had only to carry out his p!an to the end. He meant Sophy to be"], [178, "170 THE VENETIANS. his means of communication with Eve. He meant to reach the wife's ear through the sister. \"I'll make his life as miserable as he has made mine, if I can,\" he said to himself. Sophy stood before the portrait, dumb with misery. What did he mean \u2014 what could he mean by placing the singer's portrait there, the crowning gem of his luxurious rooms, a portrait which even her ignorant eye told her must be by the brush of a master, so bold and brilliant was the handling ? Even the easel, with its costly draping of orange and gold, was a work of art. What right had he to exhibit such a portrait ; the portrait of an improper young woman, in all probability ? She felt sorry that she had accepted his invita tion. She felt as if she had been brought to a house which was hardly fit for her to enter. And yet there were the^Montfords and Lady Hartley chattering at their ease in the next room ; so it could hardly be \" bad form \" to come here. \" What do you think of the likeness ? \" asked Sefton, lolling against a tall Versailles chair, and contemplating the brilliant face in the picture with a smile."], [179, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 171 \" I suppose it is a very good likeness,\" said Sophy, \" but of a vulgar face \u2014 very handsome, no doubt ; nobody can deny that \u2014 but quite peuple\" \" Yes, it is peuple. That is one of its charms. It has all the fire and freshness of an unsophisti cated race, generations of fishermen, sailors, gondoliers, all that there is of a frank free life between sea and sky. You can't get such beauty as that from a race reared indoors. It is an open-air loveliness, as rich in grace and colour ing as one of those strange sea-flowers that unfold their vivid petals under the clear bright water.\" \" You admire her very much ? \" faltered Sophy. \" Yes, I admire her very much. You and I have got on so well together, Miss Marchant, that I feel I may talk to you with all the freedom of friendship \u2014 and confide in you as I have con fided in no one else.

Even her beauty charmed me less than that delicious spontaneity which struck a new chord in the genius of the stage. I went night after night to see her and hear her, without fear of danger ; and unawares I became her slave. I love her as I never loved before \u2014 not even when I used to fancy myself in love with your charming sister.

She waited silently, and Sefton went on, look ing at the portrait, not at the woman to whom he was talking. An angry glow was on his cheek. An angry light was in his eyes. The thought of the social sacrifice he had been prepared to make and the futility of his offer lashed him to fury. \" I would not degrade her by a dishonourable proposal. No, though I knew she was not spot less \u2014 though I knew her as the mother of a nameless child. She was all the world to me, and what social consideration should a man set against that which is his all of happiness or hope ? I asked her to be my wife, offered her my place in society, my passionate love, a life's devotion, and she refused me \u2014 refused me after more than a year of friendship, a friendship which had seemingly brought us very near to each other.\" \" She refused you ? \" exclaimed Sophy, behold ing in one comprehensive glance this charming house in Tite Street, the Manor, and all its be longings dead and alive, together with this"], [182, "174 THE VENETIANS. remarkably handsome and agreeable man to whom these things belonged ! \" She refused you! Why, what a preposterous minx she must be!\" \"Yes, that's the word, Miss Marchant. It seems preposterous, doesn't it, that an Italian peasant, with only her voice and good looks \u2014 and the hazardous success of a comic opera singer \u2014 for her fortune, should refuse an English gentle man with a handsome rent-roll. But the thing is true all the same. She refused me. Can you guess why ? \" I can only imagine that she is a brainless idiot,\" said Sophy, feeling that she might be tempted to take out her bonnet pin and run it into that vivid face, if it were not for the glass which protected the picture. She was too angry with Signora Vivanti for having won Mr. Sefton's affections to be grateful to her for having refused his hand. \" There is always a reason for everything,\" said Sefton, after a backward glance at the other room which showed him that there was no one near enough or unoccupied enough to overhear or observe him ; the banjoist being still the centre"], [183, "175 \"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" of attraction, and everybody clustered about him in the neighbourhood of the piano. \" There is always a reason if one will only look for it. Sig nora Vivanti refused me because she was in love with another man, the man she knew and loved in Venice, the man who brought her to London and established her in the house she occupies, and had her trained for the stage. Forgive me, Miss Marchant, if I go a step further and say the man who is the father of her son ! \" Sophy drew herself up with an offended air, and flashed an angry look at him. \" You have no right to talk to me in this way, Mr. Sefton. I don't understand why you should select me for your confidante,\" she said icily, moving towards the next room. \" Pray forgive me. You are clever and sympa thetic. I have no sister, and in certain crises of life a man feels the need of a woman's sympathy. And then there were other reasons ; or at least there was another reason.\" He stopped, embarrassed, looking at her with a curious hesitation; looking from her to the group by the piano, where Eve's face shone out among the rest, smiling at the American's last ebullition."], [184, "176 THE VENETIANS \"You are hinting at something dreadful,\" Sophy said, with a scared look. \" Do you mean that the man is \u2014 is some one I know ? \" \" Don't tell her, Miss Marchant. I would not for worlds have her know. It would do no good. It might make her miserable. Women are so sensitive, even about the past, and I fear this affair is going on in the present.\" \" Don't tell her ! \" echoed Sophy. \" You mean my sister ! And the man is \u2014 Jack ! Oh, what a wretch he must be ! \" \" Weak rather than wicked, perhaps. Don't be too hard upon him in your innocence of life. When a man has forged fetters of that kind it ain't easy to break them.\" \" A man so fettered has no right to marry. It would break her heart if she knew.\" \" She need not know. You won't tell her ; and I'm sure I shan't. But you are a girl with strong sense ; and you love your sister. I thought it only right that you should know.\" \" You may be mistaken.\" \" Hardly likely. It is an open secret that he established her in lodgings and paid for her edu cation. And over and above that evidence there"], [185, "\"CLOSER SWAM THE THUNDER-CLOUD.\" 177 is the fact that he still visits her. I met him leaving her rooms only a few days ago.\" \" The wretch ! The hypocrite ! He seems to idolize Eve ! \" \" And Eve is happy in that idolatry. For pity's sake, Miss Marchant, don't let her see the seamy side of a husband's character.\" Eve came towards the archway at this moment. \" You have lost ever so many amusing stories,\" she said to her sister. \" Your banjoist is the most entertaining person I have met this season, Mr. Sefton, and he has made us all oblivious of time. I have just discovered that it is ever so much past six.\" \" ' Ever so much ' meaning a quarter of an hour,\" retorted Sefton, laughing. He dropped a fold of the brocade drapery as Eve drew near, and the portrait was hidden before her face appeared in the curtained arch. He looked at her, trying to recall his feelings of a time gone by, when he had been \u2014 or had fancied himself \u2014 in love with her. Oh, what a weak, hesitating love that had been, as measured against his devotion to this scum of the lagunes \u2014 this gutter-bred minx who had scorned him ! VOL. III. N"], [186, "178 THE VENETIANS. \" A preposterous minx ! \" he repeated to him self by-and-by, when he was alone. \" I thank thee, child, for teaching me that word. Well, I have sown the wind ; I wonder whether I shall have a prosperous harvest, and reap the whirl wind ? \""], [187, "179 CHAPTER VII. \" THOU MAYST BE FALSE AND YET I KNOW IT NOT.\" Before addressing his confidences to Sophy Marchant, Mr. Sefton had assured himself that she did not belong to that exceptional order of womankind who, in honour and discretion, are on a level with wise and honourable men. He had known the young lady quite long enough to know that, although sharp and clever, she was shallow brained, impulsive, and emotional. He was very sure that with every desire to spare her sister pain she would end by telling Eve of her husband's infidelity. The secret would be kept for some days, perhaps, or even for some weeks ; but it would be as a consuming fire, and would ultimately break out into flame \u2014 a flame that would devour his rival's peace of mind, and devastate his rival's home. The more scathing that whirlwind which was"], [188, "180 THE VENETIANS. to come from the wind of his sowing, the happier the result for Sefton. It was in vain that Lisa had denied her son's paternity. In Sefton's mind there was no shadow of doubt that Vansittart had been, and even now was her lover \u2014 and it was for love of Vansittart that his, Sefton's, honour able attachment had been scorned by her. King Cophetua had offered himself to the beggar-maid, and the beggar-maid had refused him. Was that a humiliation for a man to forgive ? Was that a disappointment to go unavenged? All the latent malignity of Sefton's nature was aroused into active life by that fierce passion of jealousy. He had not misinterpreted Sophy's character. She was very silent in the homeward drive with her sister, lolling back in the victoria, looking vacantly at the carriages and the people as they passed. \" How tired you look, Sophy ! \" Eve said, as they crossed the park, where the carriages and riders and loungers had dwindled considerably within the past week. \" I fancy even you begin to feel you have had enough of gadding about ? \" \" Yes, I have had enough, more than enough,\" Sophy answered, with a little choking sob."], [189, "\"THOU MAYST BE FALSE.\" 181 She could no more suppress her own feelings, bear her own troubles, and be dumb, than a child can. It was quite as much as she could do to keep herself from crying, in the broad light of summer evening and Hyde Park. \" My poor Sophy, what has happened to dis tress you ? \" Eve asked affectionately. \" You and Mr. Sefton had such a long confabulation in that inner room. I really thought the crisis had come.\" \"There was no crisis; there never will be. You were right. He was only fooling me. All his fine speeches, his sentimental talk \u2014 his way of holding one's hand as if he would like to squeeze it, and was only prevented by his deep respect for one \u2014 he did squeeze it at the carriage door that night when we stayed so late at Mrs. Macpherson's delightful party \u2014 it all meant nothing \u2014 less than nothing.\" \" But how do you know, Sophy ? \" Eve asked earnestly. \"He can't have told you that he doesn't care for you ? \" \" No ; but he can have told me that he is in love with another woman \u2014 a low-born, ignorant creature, who can do nothing but sing and strut"], [190, "182 THE VENETIANS. about the 'stage in the boldest, horridest way, showing her lace petticoats and her legs,\" said Sophy, disgustedly, forgetting how she had admired Signora Vivanti. \" Do you mean the singer at the Apollo ? \" asked Eve. \"Yes, Signora Vivanti. He is in love with her, if you please, and she has refused him.\" Eve remembered her husband's explanation of Lisa's letter. \"He told you this \u2014 chose you for his con fidante. How odd ! \" \"Rather bad form, wasn't it? I fear I had been too \u2014 what young Theobald calls \u2014 coming on. I thought he liked me, and I encouraged him, and he rewards me by confiding his attach ment to that creature.\" \" And she has refused to marry him. Why ? \" asked Eve, very pale. . \" Who knows ? Mere airs and graces, I dare say. She thinks she has all London at her feet, and that she can pick and choose. How I wish I were on the stage ! I can sing pretty well, can't I, Eve ? And I have often been told that I am like Ellen Terry.\""], [191, "\"THOU MAYST BE FALSE.\" 183 In her angry excitement, Sophy saw a vision of herself as the queen of a theatre, all the town rushing to see her act, as they went to see this Venetian peasant. Surely a young lady with good blood in her veins must be better than a girl bred in a hovel. Sophy did not pause to consider that it was the rough freshness, the primitive vigour of the peasant which constituted Signora Vivanti's chief claim to notice. Sophy had exercised no small amount of self control in restraining her tears during the home ward drive ; but once safe in the sanctuary of her own bedroom she let loose the flood of her emotions, with its cross-currents of anger and sorrow, disappointed ambition, and disappointed love. Yes, love. Considering Mr. Sefton, in the first instance, only from the social point of view, with the mercenary feelings engendered by a youth of poverty, she had allowed herself to be beguiled by his attentions, and had entered at the golden gate of that fool's paradise which first love creates for its victim \u2014 a world of fevered dreams, where nothing is but what is not. Walk ing in the enchanted groves of that paradise, she had seen Mr. Sefton in the light that never was"], [192, "184 THE VENETIANS. on land or sea \u2014 the light that beautifies all waking dreams \u2014 and she had interpreted every speech of his after her own fashion. Words lightly spoken took the deepest meaning \u2014 not his meaning, but hers. She told herself again and again that, if he had not actually asked her to be his wife, he had spoken words which a man only speaks to the woman whose life is to be interwoven with his own. Eve came to her sister's door and insisted upon being admitted. \" Oh, what streaming eyes ! Sophy, dearest, I am so sorry you have allowed yourself to care for him. I warned you, dear ; I warned you.\" \"Yes,\" retorted Sophy, irritated beyond measure at a form of speech which is always irritating, \" but you didn't warn me of anything like the truth. You didn't tell me that he was pas sionately, ridiculously, degradingly in love with that Venetian girl.\" \" My dearest, how could I warn you of what I did not know ? \" \"Don't dearest me. I am almost out of mv mind \u2014 indeed, I should not be surprised if I were to go mad, or have brain fever, or something."], [193, "185 \"THOU MAYST BE FALSE.\" When I remember how I have lowered myself\u2014 letting him see that I cared for him ; for I have no doubt he did see, and that was why he made me his confidante this afternoon, and told me about that creature \u2014 a woman with a nameless son. Do you think I can ever get over the degradation of being talked to about such a subject ? \" Eve did not answer. She sank down upon the sofa, while her sister stood before the looking glass, frowning at her tear-stained face as she unbuttoned the bodice of her gown, that gown which she made a point of calling her \" frock.\" Her nameless son. Eve remembered the boy in the boat, the beautiful Murillo-faced boy, looking up with big wondering eyes as his mother and Vansittart clasped hands. Her nameless son. She remembered that curious speech of Van sittart's a week ago \u2014 \" Yes, it was at Venice we met. That is the first half of the riddle.\" What was the second half? The parentage of that boy, perhaps. His son \u2014 his son \u2014 another woman's and his. And she, his adoring wife, had no son to place in his arms, no child to gratify the prosperous man's desire to see his race prolonged."], [194, "186 THE VENETIANS. \"If I live to be an old woman he may die without an heir,\" she thought. \" There may be no more Vansittarts of Merewood. Hannah's husband did not hate her because she was child less \u2014 but then he had other wives.\" She pictured her husband loving that alien's son, making him his heir perhaps by-and-by, desiring to bring him into his home, asking her to receive Hagar's child, to let him call her mother. She had heard of such things being done. \" No, no, no, not for worlds,\" she \"protested to herself. \" I could not do it.\" She got up and walked about the room, while Sophy bathed her eyes, and tried to undo the damages her emotions had inflicted on her fair and delicate prettiness. \" I can't go to the party looking like this,\" exclaimed Sophy, ruefully contemplating her swollen eyTelids in the glass. \" We need not go till half-past ten. Eleven o'clock would be early enough. There is time for you to get back your good looks. Benson shall bring you a light little dinner, and then you had better lie down and take a long nap.\""], [195, "\"THOU MAYST BE FALSE.\" 187 \" Do you think I can eat or sleep in my state of mind ? \" protested Sophy ; but a quarter of an hour later, when Benson appeared with an appetizing meal, the victim of misplaced affection found that violent emotions are not incompatible with hunger. She eat an excellent dinner, cried a little now and then between whiles, and at half-past ten went down to the drawing-room in her most attractive frock, and with her light fluffy hair piled as high as she could pile it, and sparkling with those dainty paste stars which Eve had sported at the memorable hunt ball. \"Sophy,\" cried Vansittart, \"I vow you look almost as pretty as Eve looked that night in the snow. And what do I see ? Surely I know those quivering starlets ! You are wearing the family diamonds.\" Sophy rewarded him with a most ungracious scowl, and moved to the other side of the room. Vansittart was looking at an evening paper, and was serenely unconscious of the change in his sister-in-law's manner; but Eve saw that angry glance and movement of avoidance, and wondered what could have caused such rudeness. Temper,"], [196, "188 THE VENETIANS. perhaps; only poor Sophy's petulant temper, which had never been discriminating in its out bursts. This was Sophy's way of keeping a secret. Her visit to Charles Street ended two days later. She was studiously uncivil to her host up to the hour of her departure ; and in her farewell talk with her sister, being closely questioned by Eve as to the reason of this change in her manner, she prevaricated, hesitated, said things and unsaid them ; and finally, in a flood of compassionate tears, she protested that it was only on Eve's account she was angry with Eve's husband. Mr. Sefton had told her that Vansittart still visited that odious woman. Mr. Sefton had met him leaving her house only a few days previously ; and Mr. Sefton had assured her that it was he, Eve's husband, who had brought Signora Vivanti to London, and paid for her musical education. \"Can you wonder that I am angry with him, Eve, loving you as I do? You have been so good to me, so generous. It would be wicked of me to go away without warning you. I hated the idea of telling you. I have thought over it again and again. I promised Mr. Sefton that I"], [197, "189 \"THOU MAYST BE FALSE.\" would tell you nothing ; but I could not bear the idea of your being hoodwinked by an unfaith ful husband. It was right to tell you, wasn't it, dear? It is better for you to know the truth, is it not ? \" \" Yes, yes, it is better for me to know,\" Eve answered, in a hard, cold voice. \" How quietly she takes it ! \" thought Sophy, as the footman announced the carriage. Benson had gone on with Sophy's luggage in a four-wheel cab; twice as much luggage as Sophy had brought from Fernhurst. \" I shall never forget your kindness to me,\" said Sophy, with her parting kiss. \" And I shall never forget your visit,\" answered Eve. Eve was not at home at luncheon time, so Van sittart went off to his club, and only returned to Charles Street at Eve's usual hour for afternoon tea, when he was told that Mrs. Vansittart had gone out at three o'clock, and had left a note for him in the study. The note was a letter. \" I am taking a step whicn will no doubt make"], [198, "190 THE VENETIANS. you angry,\" Eve began, \" but I cannot help my- self. I cannot go on living as we are living now. Every hour of my life increases my misery. I have been told that you visit that woman \u2014 that woman who is the cause of all my unhappiness. I have been told \u2014 what I ought to have under- stood without telling \u2014 that it is you who brought her to London, and had her educated for the stage ; that her child is your child. I ought to have known all this without being told ; but I shut my eyes to the truth. I wanted so to believe in you. I clung so desperately to that which makes the happiness of my life. You accuse me of unreasoning jealousy ; but could any wife help being jealous, seeing what I have seen, hearing what I hear? That woman's face and manner spoke volumes. I tried to accept your explana- tion \u2014 tried to believe you. I had even begun to feel happy again, when I learnt this hateful fact of your visit to her house.

So her letter to her husband written, and her mind made up, she had only7 to drive to Don Saltero's Mansion to make her way to that upper floor in which the singer had her bower. The door was opened by Fiordelisa her self, who gave a little look of surprise at seeing her visitor, and then stood in mute wonder, waiting for Eve to speak, smiling faintly, and evidently embarrassed. She wore her accustomed black stuff gown, with a yellow silk handkerchief knotted carelessly on her breast, and her dark hair heaped untidily upon the top of her head.

Lisa noted her rival's toilette in all its elegant details, the long loose grey gloves, the grey parasol. For a minute or so the two women stood thus, looking at each other in silence. Then, with an effort, Eve spoke. \" Are you alone, Madame Vivanti ? \" '\u2022 Alone, all but Paolo, and I don't suppose you count him anybody, Eccellenza. La Zia has gone to London.\" \"I have come to talk to you \u2014 about my husband.\" Lisa flushed crimson. \"Please take the trouble to sit down, Excel lenza,\" she said politely, placing her prettiest armchair in front of the open window. There were flowers in the balcony, a bed of marigolds, a flower which la Zia had discovered to be decorative and cheap. For perfume there were stocks and mignonette. The balcony was wide enough to hold plenty of flowers, and a couple of basket chairs in which Lisa and her aunt sat for many idle hours in fine weather, VOL. 1IL o"], [202, "194 THE VENETIANS. breathing the cool breezes from the river, and submitting to the blacks. They thought of their attic window in the Campo, and the life and movement in the paved square below, the passing and repassing of the gay, light-hearted crowd to and fro on the Rialto, the twanging of a guitar now and then, the tinkling of wiry mandolines, the nasal tones of a street-singer. Here they had a wider horizon, but a murkier sky, and not that concentration of gaiety which makes every campo in Venice a busy little world, self-contained and all-sufficing. Eve looked round the room, noting the pretty furniture, obviously chosen by a person of taste ; the open piano ; the glimpse of a some what untidy bedroom through a door ajar. Her husband had chosen the furniture, Eve told herself. He had built this nest for his Venetian singing-bird. \" I am looking at your rooms,\" she said, with pale lips ; \" the rooms my husband furnished for you.\" Lisa had not even the grace to attempt a denial. \"He was very good, very generous,\" she faltered, her eyes suffused with tears, those tears"], [203, "IN THE BLUE CHAMBER. 195 which came so readily to Lisa's eyes, on the stage or off. \" There never was any one so good as he.\" \"He owed you at least as much as that,\" said Eve, sternly. \" It was the least he could do.\" \" Ah, he has told you then,\" cried Lisa, eagerly ; \" he has told you his secret.\" \"No, he has not told me. He was too much ashamed to tell me of anything so degraded and shameful. He is not shameless like you,\" said Eve, trembling with indignant feeling. It was all true then, all that Sefton had told her sister; all that her own jealous fears had suggested. This woman stood before her, un abashed, ready to expatiate upon her sin. \" He has told me nothing,\" she said, \" or if he has spoken of you it has only been to deceive me. But there are some things that are easy to guess, when a woman has lived in the world as I have, and has heard other women talk.

I thought then that he would hardly have been so kind to me and my aunt unless he loved me. But he told me that he loved an English girl, and that she was to be his wife. There was no hope for me.

Only one moment, and then he flung me from him as if I were dirt.\" \" He must have been very chivalrous to do so much for friendship,\" said Eve, shaken, but not convinced. The woman spoke with the accents of truth ; but Eve remembered that she was an actress, trained in the art of simulated passion. No doubt it was easy for an actress to lie like truth. \" He wanted to help us,\" protested Lisa ; \" he blamed himself so much for \" She stopped, coloured, and then grew pale. It was evident to her now that Vansittart's wife had been told nothing, and she, Lisa, had been on the point of betraying him. \" For what ? Why did he blame himself? \" \" Did I say ' blame ' ? I use wrong words some times,\" she said, quick to recover herself. \"I hardly know your language. He pitied us : that is what I meant to say. He pitied us because we were alone and poor \u2014 two helpless women.\" \" And the father of your child, where was he ?\" Eve asked sternly, only half convinced. \" Why did not he help you ? \""], [207, "IN THE BLUE CHAMBER. 199 Paolo had grown tired of his book, and had gone back to his mother's knee. He stood half hidden in Lisa's gown, looking earnestly at the stranger, his infantile mind puzzled at the tone and manner of the two women, feeling dimly that there was a tempest in the atmosphere, feeling it as the birds feel when they twitter apprehensively before the coming of the thunder. Inquisitive as well as alarmed, and bold in his wonder, he went over to Eve, and took hold of her gown, and looked up in her face. She looked down at him, and it was her turn to wonder. Of whom did the face remind her ? He was like his mother ; but it was not her face he recalled to Eve. Nor was it Vansittart's face, though she tried, shrinkingly, to trace a re semblance there, looking for something she hoped not to see. No, the face recalled some other face, and the likeness, faint and indefinable as it was, thrilled her with a tremulous awe, as if she had seen a ghost. \"You had a claim upon this child's father,\" said Eve, her hand lightly touching the boy's head, and then shrinking away as if it had"], [208, "200 THE VENETIANS. touched pollution ; \" the strongest possible claim, for he ought to have been your husband. Why did not he help you ? \" \" Because he was in his grave,\" said Lisa ; and again the ready tears gushed out. There was a pause, and then Eve spoke in a gentler tone. \" That was hard for you,\" she said, with a touch of pity. ] \" Yes, it was very hard. He had promised to marry me. I think he would have married me, for Paolo's sake. My baby was not born till afterwards \u2014 after his father's death.\" \" Poor creature. All that was very sad.

It was for my sake, and la Zia's, that he was kind. I tell you again, he pitied us.\" Eve sank into a chair, drooping, miserable. Even yet she could not believe in this story of Vansittart's chivalrous kindness to two foreign waifs who had no claim upon his friendship, not even the claim of country. She knew him to be"], [209, "201 IN THE BLUE CHAMBER. benevolent, generous, full of compassion for all suffering of man or beast ; but there was nothing Quixotic in his benevolence. That which he had done for Lisa was too much to be expected of any man who was not a millionaire or a musical fanatic. He could not have done so much with- out a strong motive. And then once again she reminded herself that Lisa was an actress, to whom all falsehoods and shams must be easy. She started to her feet, indignant with this woman for deceiving her ; angry with herself for being so easily duped. \" I don't believe a word you have told me,\" she cried. \" I believe that Mr. Vansittart was your lover; my husband, John Vansittart, and no other ; and when he came here the other day you had lured him back to your net.\" \"You don't believe \u2014 you don't believe in Paolo's dead father ?

She stood like a woman of stone till the door closed on him, and the outer door opened and shut again. Then she clasped her hands above her head with a distracted gesture, and rushed out upon the balcony to see the last of him. She leant over the high iron rail to watch him as he sprang into the waiting hansom. She saw him drive away, and did not shriek to him to come back, though her whole being, brain, heart, nerves, yearned after him, with the wild yearning of despairing love. She watched till the cab vanished from her sight, hidden by the foliage on the Embank ment, and then she dragged herself slowly back to the room, as a wounded animal crawls to its lair, and flung herself upon Lisa's sofa, a broken hearted woman. \" Could I act otherwise, \u2014 could I, could I ? \" she asked herself. \" My brother, my own flesh and blood !

It is our fate.\" \" Fate ! \" cried Lisa, contemptuously. \" What is fate? It is you, not Fate, that make the parting. If you loved him you would not let him go.\" \" If I loved him ?

When first he came to Burano I worshipped him as if he had been St. Mark. And when he said, ' Come to Venice with me, Lisa, and be my little wife,' I went. It was wicked, I know. I ought not to have left Burano till I had been to confession, and the priest had married us ; but when I said, ' You will marry me, Signor Inglese,' he said, 'Yes, Lisa, by-and-by,' and that was what he always said till the last \u2014 ' by-and-by.' He was not always kind to me, Si'ora, though he was your brother. He beat me sometimes when the luck had been bad at cards.

He would start up out of his chair, and swear a big English oath, and strike at me with his clenched fist. But am I sorry ? Yes, of course I am sorry. It was dreadful to see him fall dead in a moment ; but is that to be remembered against your husband years afterwards? He was brutal, so brutal that he deserved his death, almost. He flew at the strange Englishman like a tiger. He would not listen, he would not believe that I was"], [228, "220 THE VENETIANS. not false to him. He was mad with drink and foolish anger. He was like a wild beast. And for an accident like that you would make the noblest of men unhappy. Ah, Si'ora, that is not love.

What would their life be to me, or their death, if I had him ? \" \"You are a semi-civilized savage, and you can't understand,\" said Eve, sternly. \" Life and death, good name, and honour, have no meaning for you.\" \" Love means more than all,\" said Lisa, doggedly. \" There is only one man you have the right to love,\" said Eve ; \" the man who ought to have been your husband. You must be indeed a wretch if you can love the man who killed him.\" \" Ah, madonna mia, we do not make our hearts. They are made for us,\" Lisa pleaded naively. \" The Signor Inglese was very good to me at Burano in my poverty ; but afterwards, at Venice, I had a good deal to suffer. It was a hard life sometimes.

It is sweet to say these for his sake : that his sin may be forgiven.\" \"Ah, you do not understand. You do not know what death is,\" said Eve, with gloomy anger, getting up from the sofa, and rearranging her loosened hair with trembling hands. \" It must come to all of us,\" answered Lisa, with a philosophical shrug. \" Better that it should come in a moment as his came, without suffering, without fear, than that we should live to be old and fat and full of maladies.

You, his mistress, evidently cared nothing for him.\" And with this verbal stab, she departed. Who shall say whether she was more indignant with the Venetian for loving Harold Marchant too little or for loving John Vansittart too much ? Her carriage was waiting for her ; the servants were asleep in the afternoon sun. She was only just able to utter the monosyllable \"Home,\" in answer to the footman's question. How strange the streets and all their move ment of everyday life seemed to her, as she drove along the interminable King's Road, and by Sloane Street and the Park \u2014 how careless the faces of the people. Was there no other trouble in the world but her own ? Was everybody else busy, and bustling, and happy ? She felt as if she had been driving home from a funeral, wondering to find a world where there were no signs of sorrow. Had she not verily parted from her dead ? The dead brother whom she had always"], [231, "'\"TIS NOT THE SAME NOW.\" 223 pictured to herself as alive and happy in some far off African wilderness, leading the adventurer's solitary life, caring for no one he had left in the civilized world, but destined^ to come back to her hereafter with that wild spirit tamed, and his boyish affections reviving with mature years. He was dead, and she would see him no more on earth \u2014 killed in a tavern brawl, for the sake of a worthless woman. And the husband she adored, he, too, was dead \u2014 dead to her for ever. She had renounced him, and he was free to go his own way, and lead his own life, and find consolation and happiness where he could. Her friends of Mayfair had told her that no man laments long for the loss of any woman ; that one beautiful face pushes aside another; that there is no image, however cherished, which does not grow faint, and fade and vanish, as a circle widens and melts away upon still water. Even the house in Charles Street had a strange aspect when she re-entered it. Should she find him there? Would he plead with her again, in their own house, where she had been so happy with him, where all mute things reminded her of the glad life he had given her ? Would he plead"], [232, "224 THE VENETIANS. with her once more, and renew the agony of the struggle between love for the living and loyalty to the dead ? No ; she was spared that ordeal. The servant who opened the door told her that his master had been summoned hurriedly to Southampton, and had left a letter for her. She caught up the letter eagerly, hungry, in her desolation, for some sign from him, some last link between them. \" I start by the mail for Southampton,\" he wrote. \" Till nine I shall be within reach of a telegram at the Travellers, if you change your mind.

She went about bidding the rooms good-bye, looking at them for the last time, as she believed, for she meant to depart on her journey early next morning. To depart whither ?

Fernhurst would not do. It was too near Lady Hartley ; it was not remote enough from Mere wood. She had to find some abiding place which should be unknown to all the world except the servant who went with her. She did not feel herself equal to travelling without a servant. The ways of luxury had spoiled her for the ways of independence. She was no longer the same young woman who used to head an early expedi tion from Haslemere to Waterloo, travelling third class, among soldiers and workmen, to be first in the scramble for bargains at a sale of drapery.

Can't you understand"], [239, "\"'TIS NOT THE SAME NOW.\" 231 that there are griefs that won't bear to be spoken of ? Mine is one of them. I am going abroad ; I hardly know where as yet. To some quiet place in Brittany or Normandy most likely, where I can just exist.\" \" Oh, my dear young lady, you will kill your self with grief,\" sobbed Benson, as she poured out tea for her mistress. While Benson was packing, with all the dexterity and method of an accomplished packer, Eve was employed in writing the most difficult letter she had ever written in her life. She was writing to her husband's mother, the woman who had received her at first reluctantly, but afterwards with motherly affection; the woman who had surrendered the son she adored to the wife he had chosen for himself, and who looked to that wife for the happiness of her son's future years. Penniless, the daughter of a dis reputable father, with no social surroundings or family influence to recommend her, she had been accepted by Jack Vansittart's relations; petted and praised by his sister ; lovingly cherished by his mother ; and for recompense of their trust in her what was she going to give them ?"], [240, "232 THE VENETIANS. She was going to spoil her husband's life in the heyday of youth and love; to leave him bound in wedlock and yet companionless ; with a wife and no wife. He could not divorce her ; she could not divorce him. His sin was not of the kind which breaks marriage bonds. What could she say to her mother-in-law which could in any manner explain or justify the part ing of husband and wife who until yesterday had been living together in seemingly happiest union ? There was no explanation, no justifica tion possible. The mystery of those two broken lives and broken hearts must remain for ever dark to their kindred and the world. \" My husband and I have agreed to part, and our parting must needs be for a lifetime,\" she wrote. \" We can tell no one our reasons, not even you, mother, who of all people have the strongest right to question us. Unfaithfulness or lessening love has nothing to do with our separation. I never loved my husband better than I love him now ; or, at least, I never knew the strength of my love for him so well as I know it now. What must be must be. It is Fate, and not our own will, that divides us."], [241, "\"'TIS NOT THE SAME NOW.\" 233 Wherever he may go my heart goes with him. Think of me with indulgence if you can ; pity me if you can, for I have direst need of your pity.\" She said nothing about her destination. She had not made up her mind yet where she was to go. She sat for an hour or more turning the leaves of the Continental time-table ; now think ing she would go by Ostend, and to the Ardennes ; and then again deciding upon Brittany. It mattered nothing to her where she went; all places were alike, except for her desire to avoid the people she knew. Finally she decided upon crossing to St. Malo by the boat that left Southampton at five o'clock next day ; and from St. Malo to Dinan or Avranches. She would avoid the seaside, where English visitors would be likely to be met at this season. The Norman and Breton towns she knew by repute as places where people lived quietly and economically, forgotten by the world.

Do not be uneasy about me, my dear mother. I shall take counsel with experienced travellers before I turn my back upon the civi lized world ; and I shall not go to meet fever, famine, or assassination. You shall hear from me at each stage of my wanderings. I do not go as a scientific explorer, or as a sportsman in quest of big game, though I hope to make good use of my gun.

Hail, dark mother of wanderers, parched nurse of lions ! Amidst thy sandy wilderness grief and dishonour may forget themselves ; with thee man is only man ! He leaves that other half of him self, reputation, yonder in the crowd, and in these solitudes becomes a creature of thews and sinews, valuable only for his strength and endurance, for the range of his eye and the truth of his hand. He has done with the outward shows of life, and with all nice differences between good and bad. Here, worth is to be measured by the hunter's fleetness of foot, and honour by the marksman's aim. What a man is counts for but little ; what he can do for much. In that aching misery which possessed him when he left England, John Van sittart looked to the desert as his best refuge."], [245, "237 A DOUBLE EXILE. The hunter's life in Mashonaland gives scanty leisure for brooding over the ruins of a home in England. The early trek with the waggons, or the start on foot from the skerm ; the hard day's tramp under the blazing sun; the need of pro viding meat for the boys \u2014 the long following on the spoor of giraffe or antelope, with the wild ride or cautious stalk at the end \u2014 which that need involves ; the charm of the life, its poetry, its absolute novelty, and the ever-recurring vicis situdes which each new day brings forth, leave the head of the expedition briefest time for in trospective thought. His slumbers are for the most part dreamless ; or his dreams are of lions prowling by the camp-fire, or of the dark forms and wild gestures of those he has last seen dancing by its flickering light ; not of the lost faces of home. Best of all, his conscience is at ease, for face to face with man in his most primi tive aspect he loses the habit of weighing his past acts and comparing, with futile regret, the things he has done with the things he ought to have done. For Vansittart there could have been no better refuge than the desert."], [246, "238 THE VENETIANS. Here, if his heart wounds were not healed, his consciousness of sin was deadened. Here, where no exaggerated value was set on human life, he could remember Harold Marchant's death with less intensity of pain. Here, where the native freely turned his gun or his assegai against his fellow-man, a mischance such as that of Florian's Caffe seemed a small thing \u2014 the fortune of war, a spurt of anger, an unlucky blow, and there an end. Every man must die somehow ; and it may not be the worst doom to drop down in the fulness of youth and vigour, knowing not the slow agonies of gradual extinction, the torture of dying by inches. Vansittart's thoughts were tempered by his surroundings. His character took new colours in that vivid life, in that lapse backward from the civilized and the complicated to the primitive stage of man's history. It was as if Time had turned his glass and the earth were young. The wild race of Cain, the outcast, could have been no wilder than these woolly haired followers of his, who were faithful to him because he was a good shot. Nature, the great consoler, helped him to"], [247, "239 A DOUBLE EXILE. forget his grief by forgetting himself. Here, face to face with Nature's mightiest forces, man's sense of his own personality dwindles to the faintest shadow in the vastness of his surround ings. Instead of Trafalgar Square he has the Falls of the Zambesi; instead of the languid club lounger he has the elephant and the lion for his companions \u2014 the purring growl of the lion in stead of the gossip of the smoking-room ; the trumpet of the elephant instead of^the chatter of the dinner-table. Surely it is good for a man to be alone in the wilderness \u2014 alone save for the company of followers to whom, though he be their leader, he is as another being, a white man, a stranger in their land, between whose thoughts and feelings and their own a great gulf is for ever fixed. It is good for him to feel his own insignificance among men who value him only for his powder and shot, and who will lose their reverence for his white superiority with the spending of his last cartridge. Here he must needs forget that pride of place which at home was a part of his being. Here there are no tradesmen to fawn upon him, no servants to touch their hats to him, no women to praise him."], [248, "240 THE VENETIANS. Small food for vanity here, where the darkies call his smooth, flat hair dog's hair, and who liken his hairy arm to a baboon's arm. Here if the women fawn upon him it is not for his smiles or his favour, but for beads or printed calico, such vivid orange or scarlet fabrics, figured with stars or half moons, as Manchester weaves for the Torrid Zone. Here if the men are true to him it is because he can feed them and pay them. He is in a world of stern facts, where sentiment and sophistication are unknown. The atmosphere suits him. The primitive interests of this primitive life help to shut off that other life where all is gloom, the Use of thought and of memory. Sufficient for the day, that is the motto here : food for the day ; safety for the day ; wood for the fires, water for man and beast. Beside them, behind them, ahead of them, stalk dangers that Europe knows not. Danger from beasts of prey; danger from men as cruel ; fever, starvation, death in many shapes \u2014 all the vicissitudes of a life between the desert and the sky.

Travellers far more experienced wondered afterwards when they heard the story of this man's travels, and the impunity with which he had done desperate things. His daring had been the audacity of ignorance, they said. If he had known the extent of the peril in such unconsidered wanderings, with so small a party, with such inadequate preparation, he would have been a madman to set his life upon such chances. Had he answered them truthfully he would have told them that he was a madman when he turned his face towards the desert ; mad with the agony of a life that was blighted ; mad with the bitter memories of lost happiness. Of these wedded lovers, parted in the noontide of their love, one carried his wounded heart to the wilderness, and sought for tranquillity of spirit in a life of movement and peril ; the other, the weaker vessel, had no such large resources.

She went first to Avranches ; then late in the autumn she took a fancy to the solitude of Mont St. Michel, the quaint monastic citadel, the for tress on the rock ; and here, when the last of the tourists had gone, and the equinoctial gales were roaring fiercely round the Gothic towers, she took up her abode in an apartment specially prepared for her by the cheery patronne of the Inn at the Gate, an apartment upon the ramparts, with windows looking wide over the sea towards Coutance, and Jersey. Benson, who had a constitution of iron, com plained bitterly of this wind-swept rock, yet had to own later that her health had never been better. Eve stopped here late into the winter, sketching a little, reading a great deal, wander ing on the sands in all weathers, and sometimes wishing that her footsteps would take her un awares to that portion of the bay, where, as in the Kelpie's flow, sorrow might find a grave. An imprudent ramble in the marshy fields between Pontorson and the Mount, which left"], [251, "243 A DOUBLE EXILE. her belated in the mists of a November evening, resulted in congestion of the lungs. She had contrived to lose herself among those salt meadows as completely as ever her husband had lost himself in Mashonaland, and it was eleven o'clock when she and her whimpering attendant tottered along the causeway leading to the gates of the fortress, footsore and weary, their shoes worn out in that long tramp over coarse grass and sandy hillocks. Benson telegraphed to Miss Marchant at Fern hurst, and Sophy appeared on the scene as quickly as boat and rail, and a wretched fly from Avranches, with harness eked out by bits of rope, could bring her. Sophy was broken hearted at this cruel turn which her sister's bright fortunes had taken, and agonized with remorseful retrospection. It was she, perhaps, whose imprudent tongue had parted husband and wife, had destroyed that happy home. Sophy hated herself for the folly of that revelation. Why could she not have let well alone ? Why could she not have left undisturbed that happy state of things by which she herself had profited so richly? Looking back upon her conduct of"], [252, "244 THE VENETIANS. that fatal week, she saw that it was her own disappointment which had soured her, and her own selfish vexation which had made her so angry with Vansittart. It was a long time before Eve was well enough for serious talk of any kind. She rallied slowly, and during the monotonous days of her con valescence she was treated as a child, who must only hear smooth and pleasant things ; but when she was well again, quite well, save for that little hacking cough, which seemed to have become an element of her being, Sophy ventured to approach the subject of her domestic sorrows. \" I have been utterly miserable since that day I left Charles Street,\" said Sophy, seated beside Eve's easy-chair, and resting her forehead on the cushioned arm as she talked, so that her face was invisible. \"I have hated myself for speaking of your husband as I did \u2014 only upon hearsay. After all, Mr. Sefton might have mis interpreted Jack's conduct. It might all have been a mistake.\" \" It was a mistake, Sophy.\" \"Oh, I am so glad. You found out at once that Mr. Sefton was wrong.\""], [253, "245 A DOUBLE EXILE. \"Yes.\" \" Thank God ! But then \" \u2014 looking up at her sister in blank astonishment \u2014 \" if that is so, why are you parted, Jack and you ? \" \" That is our secret, Sophy.\" \"But why, but why? I can't understand. There could be only one reason for your leaving him when you loved him so dearly. Nothing but the knowledge of his infidelity would justify \u00bb \"Stop, Sophy,\" said Eve, peremptorily. \" There is nothing gained by speculating about other people's business. My husband and I have our own reasons for taking different roads. We have never quarrelled ; we have never ceased to care for each other. I shall love him with all my heart, and mind, and strength, till my last breath.\" \"I guess your reason,\" answered Sophy, nodding sagaciously. \" He is an Atheist, and you, who have always been a good Church woman, could not go on living with an un believer. You are like poor Catherine in ' Robert Elsmere.' \" \" Oh, Sophy, do you think I should forsake"], [254, "246 THE VENETIANS. him because he was without hope or comfort from God ? Why do you tease me with foolish guesses? I tell you again the reason of our parting is our secret. A secret that will go down with me to the grave.\" Sophy's eager imagination ran riot in the world of mystery. Politics, Freemasonry, Hypno tism, Theosophy, Nihilism, hereditary madness, epilepsy, hydrophobia, a family ghost, a family fatality ! That lively mind of hers touched each possibility, rejected each, and flew off to the next; and lastly, with a sigh of relief, she exclaimed \u2014 \" I am more thankful than I can say that it was not my imprudent tongue which parted you.\" An hour later, walking alone on the ramparts, she told herself that in all probability this desolate wife was only throwing dust in her eyes, and that Vansittart's inconstancy had been clearly demonstrated in accordance with Sefton's story. It would be only like a devoted wife to violate truth in order to vindicate her husband. Pride and love would alike urge Eve to deny her husband's infidelitv."], [255, "( -'47 ) CHAPTER Xl. \"OH TELL HER, BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" As soon as Eve was well enough to be moved she left the rock and went to finish the winter at Dinard. The doctor who attended her through her illness suggested the south of France, Cannes for instance, as the better climate for her ; but she told him she had lost a sister at Cannes, and that the whole Riviera was associated with her loss. \" It is very lovely,\" she said ; \" but I shall never go there again. My sister was sent there because she was consumptive; but my case is altogether different. It would be absurd to go to the south just because I have had a touch of con gestion, in consequence of an autumnal ramble.\" \" It was a rather severe touch, madam,\" said the doctor ; \" but perhaps Dinard may suit you"], [256, "248 THE VENETIANS. very well. There are some people who say the climate is almost as good as Provence.\" Sophy went with her sister to Dinard, which she pronounced a considerable improvement upon Mont St. Michel, the medi\u00e6valism of which picturesque settlement had in no wise reconciled her to the dismal solitude of a place without people and without shops. At Dinard there were smart residents even in winter, and if Eve had not been obstinately bent upon isolation they might have known people, as Sophy mur mured regretfully. Not knowing people, she soon wearied of Dinard, which was only the sands and the sea over again, when one had exhausted the town and the quaintness of shops which were unlike English shops, and had explored St. Malo and St. Servan, and excursionized, chaperoned by Benson, as far as Dinan, where she was more impressed by the bad drainage than by the fine architecture. Sophy began to talk of her home duties. Jenny's letters had been most exasperating of late, and it was too evident she was interfering with Nancy, and making a mess of the house-"], [257, "\"BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" 249 keeping. Finally Sophy declared that things at Fernhurst could go on no longer without her. Jenny had been entertaining in a most reckless manner \u2014 people to luncheon, people to tea. \" She will be giving dinner-parties next,\" said Sophy. \" Nancy is so weak about her, because she saved her life in the measles \u2014 as if it was any merit of Jenny to have had measles worse than the rest of us.\" Eve did not oppose her departure, being some what weary of that light talk which centred chiefly in self, one's own experiences, sensations, hopes, disappointments. \" How I wish you would go back with me, Eve,\" urged Sophy, with very real warmth. \" Surely you would be happier at Fernhurst than here, and it would be like the old days for us to have you again. You would be one of us, the head of the family once more. You would forget that you had ever left home.\" \" Ah, Sophy, if that were possible ! If any one could forget ! They can't, dear. They only harden their hearts aud call it forgetting. Dear old Fernhurst ! Yes, I should love to be there ; to ramble over Blackdown again, and hear the"], [258, "250 THE VENETIANS. wind whistling in the dark fir trees ; to look over the weald far off to the faint streak of distant sea, just a patch of light on the horizon and no more: But it can't be done, Sophy. Fernhurst is too near Redwold Towers, too near Mr. Sefton's place, too near all the people I have done with.\" \" Poor Eve, it is sad to hear you talk of your self as an exile, as if you had committed a crime. It was most trying when Mrs. Vansittart came over to see us, and questioned us so closely about you. Did we think this or that ? Had we known of any unhappiness between you and Jack ? Had we any idea why you parted ? I felt it more than the others, for I thought I was at the bottom of it all with my foolish speech about your husband. But I held my tongue. The others declared they knew nothing, could not even surmise a reason for your conduct. They adored Jack, thought him simply perfect as a husband, and Eve the luckiest girl of their acquaintance. And then there was Lady Hartley. Of course we had to go through the same kind of thing with her, not once but several times, for she is always nice in asking us to her house, and"], [259, "251 BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" in coming to tea with us every now and then, and I know that she is very fond of you, in her light-minded way. But, indeed, Eve, I don't see any reason why you should not go home with me. Nobody will venture to question you, and as Jack is in Africa \" \" No, no ; I could not bear to see the people I know, or the old places. I should be miserable. I see them often in my dreams \u2014 hill and common, and lane, and cottage garden, and wake dis appointed to find myself so far away. But I could not bear to be there again \u2014 without him. No, dear. Jack is travelling, and I am travelling. That is much the best arrangement.\" \"But you don't travel,\" remonstrated Sophy. \" You bury yourself alive in a place like this, and walk up and down the same stretch of sand every day, or tramp along the same chalky road, or cross the same ridiculous ferry, and march round the same windy ramparts. Surely you don't call that travelling.\" \"I mean to do better by-and-by. I mean to go to Italy. Perhaps you would spare me Hetty for a travelling companion ? \" \" Spare her, indeed ! You have but to ask"], [260, "252 THE VENETIANS. her, and she will spare herself. She won't ask my leave. She is pining for a change. She even wanted to go into a convent by way of variety. She would think nothing of going over to Rome ; and if you take her to Italy you will have to be very careful that the priests don't get hold of her.\" \"I will take care of her, Sophy. Benson and I will keep the priests at bay. Benson is a dragon of Protestantism.\" It was settled that Hester should meet Eve and her maid in Paris early in April, and that they should travel from that city, slowly and at their ease, by Basle and Lucerne to Milan, and thence to the Italian lakes, or possibly to Venice. Eve trembled as she spoke the name of that fatal city. She had a morbid longing to go there, to look upon her brother's grave before she died. She could afford to indulge any fancy in the way of travelling, for the pin-money sent her quarterly by the trustee to her marriage settlement was sufficient for her wants, and over and above this private income of hers the trustee, who was also her husband's solicitor, sent her a hundred and fifty pounds quarterly, in accordance"], [261, "\"BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" 253 with Mr. Vansittart's parting instructions. She had protested against this extra allowance, assur ing the solicitor that the income under her settlement was sufficient for her maintenance, and the solicitor had replied that he was in structed to furnish her with six hundred a year during his client's absence from Europe, and that as his client was in Africa, beyond the reach of letters, it was impossible to depart from his instructions. Eve was thus richer than her needs, and was able to be generous to the sisters, whose letters informed her of the result of her bounty, in the shape of a much smarter style of living at the Homestead. They had a page to open the door ; they dined at eight o'clock, and always had dessert on the table. They had their afternoon ; and carriages \u2014 chiefly pony \u2014 came from far distances to take tea with them, Jenny assured her sister. \" Your marriage lifted us all out of the mire, wrote Jenny ; \" but it is too sad to think of Jack in Africa and you a broken-hearted wanderer. It is awfully sad, and we can none of us guess the why or the wherefore. We feel that there must be some terrible secret. No light reason could"], [262, "254 THE VENETIANS. have parted you. Mr. Sefton is at the Manor, hunting every day, and going long distances by rail when there are no hounds in the neighbour hood. We hear he has been paying attentions to Lord Haverstock's only daughter, who will be enormously rich. No doubt he will end by marrying for money. Poor Sophy turned deadly pale the first Sunday she saw him in church. We were earlier than usual, and we were seated in our pew as he came up the nave, staring about him as coolly as if he had been in a theatre.\" With Hetty for her travelling companion, Eve felt more her own mistress, and, therefore, happier than she had felt with Sophy. Hetty was only fifteen, and might be treated as a child, and, indeed, she still possessed some of the best attributes of childhood ; was incurious about the future save when it promised some novelty, change of place, new possession, amusement or excitement ; was deeply interested in trifles, and had no margin of mind to give to serious things. Such a companion may do much for a heart weighed down by the burden of unavailing regret. Hetty, when allowed to give full scope to her own"], [263, "\"BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" 255 absorbing individuality, left very little room for any one else's feelings. Her delight in travelling was so intense as to be almost contagious. Everything interested her, and the newness of things was a perpetual surprise. She paused in her raptures only to pity the people who are doomed never to travel. She kept a list of the towns through which she passed, were it only sitting in a railway carriage. She had brought the shabby old family atlas from the Homestead, and had it open on her lap in the railway carriage, poring over it till her eyes ached, and rarely able to find the place she was looking for in that pale and faded type. They stopped a couple of nights at Basle, where the Rhine was rapture. They stopped a week at the Schweitzerhoff, and exhausted the drives and excursions about Lucerne, and explored the lake of the Forest Cantons, and climbed the Righi, and did all that the veriest Cockney tourist can do, personally conducted by Hetty, who read her Baedeker every morning, and ;gave her sister no rest till the day's excursion had been settled upon. \"Sophy said I was not to let you brood,\""], [264, "256 THE VENETIANS. explained Hetty. \" I was to take care you went about and enjoyed the scenery.\" Eve went about uncomplainingly, first to please Hetty, and next because days and weeks must be got rid of somehow, and sorrow must keep moving by day if it would court a few hours' respite by night. Eve had her little cough still \u2014 only a little cough ; but the experienced Benson heard that dull, hacking sound with some anxiety, remembering poor Peggy's chance, and how little it had done for her. Would it ever come to that pass with her young mistress, Benson wondered ? Was the fatal strain in the blood of all these fair sisters, with their transparent complexions and hectic bloom ? Half a year ago Eve had seemed in exuberant health, as well as in exuberant spirits, the fairest type of youthful womanhood, dancing along the flowery path of life with foot so light as never to touch the thorns, or disturb the snake asleep in the sun. The parting with the man she adored had changed her whole being, and the sound of her laughter was heard no more, despite of the lively Hetty's provocations to mirth. They went from Lucerne to Como, and lingered in that enchanting region until the midsummer"], [265, "\"BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" 257 heat drove them into the mountains. They roughed it in the Dolomites till October, and then went down to Lake Leman, and established themselves for the winter at Lausanne, where Eve took her sister's education seriously in hand, and placed her as day-boarder in a very superior establishment \" to be finished.\" Here they lived very quietly, Hetty interested in her work, and improving herself with a rapidity which astounded her mistresses, who had been scandalized at her benighted condition from the educational point of view, and who had not yet grasped the idea that a girl who has led a free out-of-door life until she is fifteen years old has a stock of brain power that makes education a much easier busi ness for her between that age and twenty than it is for the hapless victim of premature culture, who has been straining and exhausting the growing brain ever since she was five. Hetty revived her juvenile French, and took to German and Italian as readily as to loto or go-bang. Eve was delighted with her progress, and felt she was doing some good in the world ; and for Hetty's sake she stayed at Lausanne, with only a summer holiday in the Jura until the vol. in. s"], [266, "258 THE VENETIANS. second winter of her exile, when by her English doctor's advice she went up to St. Moritz, Hetty, who was growing a very lovely girl, accompany ing her, and turning the heads of all the young men at the Kulm Hotel, most especially when she played one of poor Samary's characters in a little French duologue with the all-accomplished Dr. Holland. Home letters told Eve that Vansittart was still in Africa, and that his mother was living very quietly at Merewood. From that lady, directly, Eve had not heard of late. She had answered her daughter-in-law's letter coldly and cruelly, as it seemed to Eve. \" I cannot enter into your domestic mystery,\" she wrote. \"I only know that you took my son's life into your keeping, and that you have wrecked it. He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. We were very happy to gether till you crossed his path ; and now he is an exile, and I do not even know the reason of his banishment. Forgive me if I say I wish he had never seen your face.\" Lord Haverstock's daughter was now the"], [267, "\"BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" 259 Honourable Mrs. Sefton, and her husband was said to have secured the highest matrimonial prize in Sussex. The lady's aristocratic features had the stamp of a shrewish temper, as plainly as ever a knife was stamped \" Sheffield.\" She was proud of her birth and of her money, and a lesser man than Wilfred Sefton would have had a bad time with her, but he was reported to be more than equal to the situation. They entertained enormously, and were considered an acquisition to the neighbourhood. The Miss Marchants had been bidden to all their parties, and Sophy's cheer ful tone in describing the high jinks at the Manor showed that she had outlived her disappointment. \" Everybody knows that he married for money and position,\" concluded Sophy, after a graphic account of a New Year's dance given by Mrs. Sefton, \" and everybody admires the way he manages his wife. He is obviously supreme in everything. If he had married a curate's daughter he could not be more completely the master, although her income is nearly treble his, and they are always buying land, either adding to the Liswold estate, or creeping over the county in other directions.

She was peuple to the marrow of her bones, and she had all the cleverness and unflagging pleasure in life which belongs to the populace. London audiences adored her, and to provincial audiences she came as a revelation of what gaiety of heart really means. She seemed a well-spring of joyousness, and sent her audience home convinced that life was not so very dreary after all. Could Eve have known more than the news papers told her she would have known that the Signora was keeping herself what Mr. Hawberk called \" straight.\" Slander had not breathed upon her name. She had loved, and her love had been rejected ; and from the hour of that rejection she had concentrated her affections upon that which never betrays or disappoints. Lisa and her aunt found the chief delight of their lives in the scraping and self-denial which enabled them to add to their hoard. Lisa no longer bought diamonds, and wore her whole fortune upon her neck and arms. The"], [270, "262 THE VENETIANS. diamonds were a very delightful form of invest ment, but the elementary theory of principal and interest had been gradually borne in upon her mind, and she now knew enough of finance to know that she ought to get something for her money. Reluctantly, and with serious misgivings, she followed the advice of her manager and opened a deposit account at the Union Bank, whither her light feet tripped gaily once a week, and where she handed in the major part of her salary to a clerk who could scarcely write the receipt under the too near radiance of those dazzling eyes. Life was so cheap for two abstemious women and one little boy. Vansittart had paid three years' rent of the flat in advance before he left Southampton. Lisa and la Zia were on velvet, and while the deposit account was growing there came offers from America, which were intoxicating in their liberality. American agents had seen and heard the lovely Venetian ; Anglo-American newspapers had written about her talents and her beauty ; and the always enterprising agent in-advance was eager to introduce her to the Western world."], [271, "263 \"BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" Lisa carried the tempting offers to her London manager, who shrugged his shoulders, and raised her salary, for the sixth or seventh time. \"You will ruin me if I try to keep you, Signora,\" he said ; \" but I can't afford to lose you.\" The prima donna and her aunt used to sit over their handful of fire in the small hours after a cheap but savoury supper of liver, or some other abomination, chopped up in a seething mass of macaroni, reeking of garlic and of grease. There was no dish the smartest restaurant in London could have provided that they would have enjoyed better than their native kitchen. They came of a people who can make a feast out of a morsel of meat which the sturdy British workman would toss to his dogs. Their luxuries and their pleasures were alike of the cheapest. A jaunt to Greenwich or Kew by river, a long day roaming about the Crystal Palace, idle after noons on the grassy levels of Battersea Park, basking in the sunshine while Paolo made pies in the sand. Pleasures as simple as these sufficed for Lisa, while her fortune was growing at the Union Bank. By the kind manager's advice she"], [272, "264 THE VENETIANS. had invested the bulk of her wealth in railway shares, to which she had added from time to time as her deposit account grew. She had at first been very chary of trusting the railway with her savings, preferring to confide in the Bank, which looked solid and respectable, but on being assured that she would get better interest from the railway with equal security, she consented to become a shareholder. It was pleasant when sitting with her aunt in a third-class carriage on the way to Windsor or Richmond to be able to remind that good lady that she, Lisa, was part owner of the carriage, and indeed of the whole line. Economical as the two women were their par simony never degenerated into meanness. If their fare was humble they were always ready to share it with a friend. Little Zinco, who was an old bachelor, dined with his pupil every Sunday, la Zia devoting the whole morning, after an early Mass in the chapel near Sloane Street, to the preparation of a little bit of beef stuffed with raisins, and a mess of rice and cheese, while Lisa in her best gown, escorted by the faithful Zinco, attended Mass at the Oratory or the Pro- Cathedral."], [273, "\"BRIEF IS LIFE, BUT LOVE IS LONG.\" 265 In their after-midnight talk by the fire, when autumnal or wintry nights made a fire a necessity, Lisa and la Zia built their castle in the air, and that castle was a small house on the Guidecca, a house of which they could let a couple of floors, reserving the piano nobile, or upper story, with its fine views over the blue water, for them selves, and furnishing the same gorgeously with carved chestnut wood and inlaid black wood, from one of the big manufactories on the Grand Canal. Here they were to live happily ever after, when once Fiordelisa had earned an income that would maintain them for the rest of their days, and pay for Paolo's education. Already he had shown a passionate love of music, and Zinco saw in him the makings of a fine opera singer. \" He will be handsome, he will be big,\" said the 'cello, \" and already at five years old he shows me that he has an ear as true as a bird's, or as yours. You will send him to the Conservatorio at Milan as soon as he is old enough to enter, and he will find his fortune in his larynx as you have.\""], [274, "266 THE VENETIANS. CHAPTER XII. \"A SCENE OF LIGHT AND GLORY.\" It was April, the third springtime after the parting of the wedded lovers, and to Eve it seemed as if many years had come and gone since she looked upon her husband's face. She had en dured her life somehow, a life of mornings and afternoons, of twilight and sunrise, of moons that waxed or waned, of seasons that changed from hot to cold and back again, a life like a squirrel's wheel, and having nothing in common with that happy wedded life in which her eyes opened every morning upon joy and love \u2014 the joy of knowing the beloved companion near, the love which seemed ever near and ever growing. Hetty had been a comfort to her in all that time, and had shown herself so sympathetic that Eve had resolved never to part with her, except"], [275, "267 \"A SCENE OF LIGHT AND GLORY.\" to a husband; and, as yet, among Hetty's numerous admirers there had been no one whom she cared for as a future husband. So far Hetty was heart whole and devoted to her sister, more than ever devoted, alas ! now, when the red flag of phthisis flaunted upon Eve's hollow cheeks, the too visible sign which indicated the beginning of the end. She had borne up bravely in those years of exile, making the best of life in some of earth's pleasantest places, courting cheerfulness for her young sister's sake, and never wearing her widowed heart upon her sleeve. She had borne up bravely, though the enemy had been at work all the time, and the fatal hereditary strain which had developed so early in Peggy, showed itself in Eve by occasional illnesses, through which she battled successfully, with the aid of much careful nursing by the skilled Benson and the devoted Hetty. They had patched her up time after time, as Benson told her compatriot courier-maids in the courier's room at the hotel, but the day was coming when patching would no longer serve \u2014 the frail frame and the brave spirit must yield to the inevitable. \" Well, it'll have to come to all of us, in our"], [276, "268 THE VENETIANS. time,\" said Benson, brushing away a tear or two, \" but it seems hard it should come to her before she's six and twenty. So pretty, too, and such a sweet disposition. It'll be a long time before I shall get a mistress I shall like as well, though when I first took the place I thought I should find it strange like, after being used only to titled people. But there, we're all human, and there ain't much difference between a plain country gentleman's, wife and a duchess when you're putting a linseed poultice on her chest.\" In the bright April weather Eve and her sister came to Venice, the city to which all Eve's thoughts had been bending ever since she left England, nearly three years before. She had always meant to go there, always wished to look upon the scene of her brother's untimely death, and to kneel beside his nameless grave before she died; but she had shrunk with an inde scribable dread from the accomplishment of her desire, her heart aching even at the thought of the pain it must cost her to look upon that place, which was associated with all her misery. Hetty had talked about Venice very often in"], [277, "\"A SCENE OF LIGHT AND GLORY.\" 269 her ignorance of all painful associations, and Eve had put her off with promises. \" Yes, dear, I mean to go there, sooner or later ; \" and Hetty hung over the coloured plan in Baedeker \u2014 the blue canal, with its curious serpentine curve \u2014 and longed to be there with all the intensity which pertains to the juvenile side of twenty. Venice, a 'name to conjure with ! She repeated those lines of Rogers', the plain unvarnished statement \u2014 \" There is a glorious city by the sea ; the sea is in the broad, the narrow streets \" \u2014 which brings that wonder-city before the eye of the mind far more vividly than all the fire and fervour of Byron, or the word-painting of Dickens and Howells. And now, now, in the beginning of the end, Eve knowing there was no time to lose, the sisters were here in the spring sunset, their gon dola moving with the smooth, delicious motion which serves as a balm for troubled spirits, a cure for all the agitations of life, moving in and out of the labyrinthine rios, as the hansom cab man of Venice takes his short cut to the Riva degli Schiavoni, and the comfortable hostelry of Danieli, where at Benson's advice rooms had"], [278, "270 THE VENETIANS. been secured on the entresol facing the water, Benson professing familiarity with almost every hotel in Europe. She had stayed at Danieli's with her Duchess, stayed there for a month, occupying the piano nobilissimo, in the most palatial wing of that patchwork of palaces, where the traveller may either find himself ushered into the medi\u00e6val splendour of a kingly chamber, or may be conducted by a labyrinth of passages to a garret looking out upon a slum that recalls St. Giles's. The wise traveller, of course, is he who gives Danieli ample notice of his coming, and for him the noble floors are reserved. The entresol was cosy rather than palatial ; the rooms were spacious, although low ; and the windows opened directly upon all the life and movement of this noisiest and gayest spot of Venice, curiously suggestive of Margate in the Cockney season, save that it is cosmopolitan instead of Cockney, and that instead of the Jew of Houndsditch one may meet the Jew from Damascus or Cairo, from Ispahan or Hungary, from Frankfort or Rome. Here all nations meet and mingle, and all tongues are heard in the voices that mix with the tramp of passing foot-"], [279, "\"A SCENE OF LIGHT AND GLORY.\" 271 steps from morning till midnight. For people who want the silence of the city by the sea, this entresol would be hardly the choicest portion of Danieli's rambling caravanserai ; but to Hetty's mind those windows opened on a scene of enchantment. The fishing-boats were coming in, their painted sails gaudier than the sunset, and an Italian man of-war was lying between the Riva and the Island church yonder. How familiar that church of St. George the Greater seemed to Hetty, and the Custom House, and the dome of Santa Maria della Salute. She had known them all her life in pictures and photographs \u2014 sham Canalettis, books of engravings \u2014 but the glory of light and colour were as new to her dazzled eyes as if she had died unawares and had come to life again in Paradise. \" Lovely, lovely ; quite too lovely,\" was all she could say, not having a Ruskinesque vocabu lary at her command. When she looked round, appealing to her sister for sympathy in this new delight, it was a shock to find the room empty. She ran into the adjoining bedroom, where"], [280, "272 THE VENETIANS. Benson was unpacking, and then into her own little room further on ; but there was no sign of Eve. \" She must have gone out for a stroll,\" Hetty said ruefully. \" She might as well have told me she was going. She ought to know that I am dying to see St. Mark's.\" Hetty knew her sister's dislike of all public rooms in hotels, so she had very little hope of finding her in any of those lounges \u2014 reading room, hall, salon \u2014 which Signor Campi has pro vided for his guests. There was no doubt in Hetty's mind that Eve had gone to look at St. Mark's, before the twilight shadows began to veil the splendour of the facade. Hetty went back to the window, and amused herself with the per petual movement on the quay, and on the water, man-of-war, P. and O., fishing-boats, barges, gondolas moving diagonally across the crimsoned water towards the crimson sky, light and colour reflected upon all things, save where the dark cool shadows accentuated that sunset splendour."], [281, "273 CHAPTER XIII. \"BOTH TOGETHER, HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" Pale, quiet, resolute, with her mind made up as to what she had to do, Eve Vansittart crossed the Piazzetta towards Florian's Caffe, and slowly, very slowly, passed in front of the windows, look ing at the loungers seated here and there at the marble tables, and wondering whether this was the scene of her brother's fate. She had not been told the name of the caffe. She only knew that it was at Venice, in Carnival time, and at a crowded caffe that the fatal encounter had happened. She passed Florian's, and a door or two further on was assailed by a photographer, who wanted to sell her views of the city at five francs a dozen, and who would not believe that she could exist VOL. III. T"], [282, "274 THE VENETIANS. without them. She looked at him absently for a minute or two while he showed his views, expatiating upon their beauty and cheapness, and after that thoughtful pause went into his shop, seated herself, and turned over the leaves of an album of specimen photographs, choosing a dozen at random \u2014 \" this \u2014 and this \u2014 and this \" \u2014 without looking at them. \" Have you had this shop long ? \" she asked. \" Fifteen years.\" \" Then you must remember something that happened in a caffe in the Piazza \u2014 Florian's, most likely \u2014 seven years ago. It was on a Shrove Tuesday, late at night. A young man was killed, accidentally, in a scuffle. Do you remember ? \" The photographer shrugged his shoulders, \" That is a thing that might happen any year at Carnival time,\" he said lightly. \"There is much excitement. Our people are good-natured, very good-natured, but they are hot-tempered, and a blow is quickly given, even a blow that may prove fatal. I cannot say that I remember any particular case.\" \" The man who was killed was an English-"], [283, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 275 man, and the man who killed him was an Englishman.\" \" Strange,\" said the photographer. \" The English are generally cool and collected \u2014 a serious nation. Had it been an American I should be less surprised. The Americans are more like us. There is more quicksilver in their blood.\" \"Cannot you remember now? An English man, a gentleman, stabbed by an English gentle man,\" urged Eve. \" Surely such things do not happen every day ? \" \" Every day ? No, Signora. But in Carnival time one is prepared for strange things happen ing. I begin to recall the circumstance, but not very clearly. A young Englishman stabbed with a dagger that had been bought over the way a short time before. He had been drinking, and was furiously jealous of a young woman who was present. He attacked his compatriot with savage violence. Yes, I recall the affair more clearly now. There were those present who said he brought his fate upon himself by his brutality. The man who stabbed him made a bolt of it, on a hint from a bystander \u2014 ran across the Piazzetta,"], [284, "276 THE VENETIANS. jumped into the water, and swam for his life. No one in Venice ever knew what became of him. He must have been picked up by a gondola, and must have got away by the rail road. Who knows? He may have got ashore on the mainland, and made his way to Mestre, so as to avoid the railway station here, where the police might be on the watch for him. Any how, he got away. He had courage, quickness, his wits well about him.\" \" It was at Florian's that this happened ? \" asked Eve. \" Yes, at Florian's \u2014 where else ? There is no caffe in Venice equal to Florian's.\" That was all. She paid for her photographs and went back to Florian's, and peered in at the bright, pretty salons, where the Italians were lounging over their coffee, with here and there a group playing dominoes, and where tourists \u2014 English, American, German \u2014 were enjoying themselves more noisily. She wondered in which of those salons the tragedy had been acted. Was the stain of her brother's blood on the floor ineffaceable, like Rizzio's in the fatal room at Holyrood ? She loitered for a few minutes, look-"], [285, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 277 ing in through the open doors and windows shudderingly ; and seeing she was observed, she moved quickly away, and presently was being followed across the piazza by a Venetian seeker of bonnes fortunes, she herself happily uncon scious of the fact. She looked at the shops in the Procuratie Vecchie, and was pestered by the touting shop keepers after their Venetian manner. She looked in at all those Eastern toys and Italian gewgaws, and jewellery which has here and there a sugges tion of Birmingham. \" Do you sell daggers ? \" she asked a black eyed youth, who had entreated her earnestly to ascend to the show-room above, assuring her that the \" to look costs nothing.\" Her question startled him. \" Daggers, yes, assuredly. Was it a jewelled dagger for her hair that the Signora desired ? He had of the most magnificent.\" No. She wanted no dagger, only to know whether he sold them, real daggers, strong enough to wound fatally. He showed her a whole armoury of Moorish knives, any one of which looked as if it might be deadly."], [286, "278 THE VENETIANS. \" Do you remember a young Englishman being killed with such a dagger as this ? \" she said, pointing to a jasper-handled knife, \" by accident, in Carnival time ? \" He remembered, or affected to remember, nothing. Leaving his shop, after buying half a dozen bead necklaces for civility, Eve found herself face to face with her Venetian admirer, upon whom she turned so dark a frown as to repel even that practised Lothario. She hurried back to Danieli's, and arrived there flushed and breath less, and far too much exhausted to do justice to the simple little dinner of clear soup and roast chicken which Benson had ordered, a dinner served in her own sitting-room, which luxury of privacy was Eve's only extravagance in her travels. Hetty questioned her sister closely, and re proached her for unkindness in going out alone ; but Eve gave her no explanation of that ex cursion. \"You are not strong enough to walk about alone, dear,\" the sister said tenderly. \" You want a great giriffe like me to give you an"], [287, "279 \"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" arm.\" This was Hetty's way of alluding to the tall slim figure which had been so much admired on the tennis courts of St. Moritz and Maloja. Eve engaged a gondola next morning. It was to be her own private gondola, and the gondolier was to give allegiance to no one else, so long as Mrs. Vansittart remained in Venice. She set out alone in her gondola directly after breakfast, in spite of Hetty's remonstrances. \" I have some business in Venice that I must keep to myself, Hetty. It will be the greatest kindness in you to ask no questions.\" \" You are full of mysteries,\" said Hetty, \" but I won't tease you. Only take care of yourself, dearest, and don't be unhappy about anything, for the sake of the sisters who idolize you.\" Eve kissed her, and went away without another word. Hetty had the whole morning to herself with Benson, who showed her St. Mark's and the pigeons, and the Doge's Palace, whisking her very speedily through all the picture-rooms, but not letting her off a single dark cell on either side the Bridge of Sighs. Eve's first visit was to the chief office of the"], [288, "280 THE VENETIANS. Venetian police, where she found an obliging functionary, who, at her desire, produced the record of the unknown Englishman's death at Florian's Caffe on the night of Shrove Tuesday, 1885. The story was bald and brief. A scuffle, ending in death, by a single wound from a dagger. The man who used the dagger had escaped. The weapon was still in the possession of the police. \" Was every means taken to find the man who killed him ? \" Eve asked. \" Every means, although there was no extra pressure put upon us to find him. Nobody came forward to identify the victim or to claim the body. He must have been a waif and stray ; his name, Smith, is one of the commonest English names, I am told, and it may have been an assumed name in his case. He was a fine young fellow, but showed marks of having lived reck lessly and drunk hard. The lines in his face were the lines that dissipated habits leave on young faces. It was a sad business. Has the Signora any personal interest in this unfortunate gentleman ? \""], [289, "281 \"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" \" Yes, he was my relation. I have come to Venice on purpose to find his grave.\" \" That will be difficult, I fear. He belonged to nobody. His bones will have been mingled with other bones in the public grave ere now.\" \" Oh, that is hard,\" said Eve, in a broken voice. \" A pauper's grave. He was a gentleman by birth and education. There were those in his own country who would have starved rather than let him lie in a nameless grave.\" The official shrugged his shoulders with the true philosophical shrug. \" Does the Signora really think that it matters whether we have as grand a tomb as Titian or lie in some forgotten spot of earth ? For my part, the finest monument that was ever set up would not console me for a short life. When these bones of mine are only aches and pains, and can carry me about no longer, away with them to the crematorium. The Signora will pardon me for venturing to state my own views, and if she desires it I will try to discover the exact circum stances of the Englishman's burial. It is possible that there may have been some one interested in his last resting-place, and the grave may have"], [290, "282 THE VENETIANS. been bought. There was a young Venetian, the girl who caused the quarrel, who seems to have been attached to him. She may have done something. If the Signora will be good enough to wait till to-morrow I may be able to furnish her with better information.\" Eve thanked him for his polite interest, and promised to recompense him for any trouble he might take on her behalf. She received a letter from him the next morning. \" The grave is the last in the avenue leading due west by the side of the south wall in the cemetery at San Michele. There is a wooden cross, and the name Smith. The\" grave was bought and the cross erected at the expense of the Venetian girl.\" Eve's gondola took her to the sea-girt burial place in the bright noonday sunshine. She carried a basket of flowers, roses and narcissus, to lay upon her brother's grave, and her mind was full of the hour when she saw him for the last time. How near in its distinctness of detail, of sensation even ; how far in that sense of remote ness which made her feel as if she were looking"], [291, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 283 across a gulf of death and time to another life. Was that really herself \u2014 that impetuous girl, whose arms had clung round her brother's neck in the agony of parting, and who had never known any other love ? To-day there was a conflict of love. There was the thought of the man whose crime had been the crime of a moment, whose punishment was the punishment of a lifetime. \" I know that he loved me,\" she told herself. \" I know that I was necessary to his happiness, and yet I sent him away from me. Could I do otherwise? No. The man who killed my brother could not be my husband, I knowing what he had done. Ah, as long as I did not know, what a happy woman I was ! And I might have lived happy in my ignorance to the end but for my own fault.\" And then with bitterest smile she said aloud \u2014 \" Oh, Fatima, Fatima, how dearly have you paid for the turning of the key ! \" She found San Michele, the quiet island of the dead, sleeping in the soft haze of morning on the bosom of the lagune. A little way off, the chimneys of Murano were tarnishing the clear"], [292, "284 THE VENETIANS. Italian sky with their smoke; the barges were loading and unloading ; the glass-makers were passing to and fro ; women and girls flip-flopping over the damp stones in their quarter-less shoes ; the children and the beggars were sprawling in the sun. There the stir and variety of life : here the silence and the sameness of death. She found her brother's grave, and the monu ment which Fiordelisa and her aunt had set up in his honour. The grave was a mound on which the grass grew tall and rank, as it grows at Torcello, above the ruins of the mother city. The monument \u2014 poor tribute of faithful poverty \u2014 was a wooden cross painted black, with an inscription in white lettering, rudely done : \u2014 SIR SMIZZ MORTO A VENEZIA, MARTEDI-GRASSO, 1885. Below this brief description were seven of those conventional figures \u2014 in shape like a chandelier-drop \u2014 which often ornament the funeral drapery that marks the house of death. These chandelier-drops, painted white on the black ground of the cross, represented tears."], [293, "285 \"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" They were seven, the mystic number, sacred to every Catholic mind. These seven tears \u2014 seven heart-wounds \u2014 were all the epitaph Lisa could give to her lover. A wreath of immortelles, black with the blackness of years, hung upon the cross. It dropped into atoms as Eve touched it, was blown away7 upon the salt sea wind, vanishing as if it had been the vision of a wreath rather than the thing itself. Eve sank on her knees in the rank grass, in the hollow between two graves, and abandoned her self to a long ecstasy of supplication, praying not for the dead, at peace beneath that green mound where the grasshoppers were chirping, and the swift lizards gliding in and out, \u2014 not for the dead, but for the man who killed him, for the con science-burdened wanderer, under torrid suns, far from peace, and home, and all the pleasures and comforts of civilization, seeking forgetfulness in the arid desert, in the fever-haunted swamp, among savage beasts and savage men, going with his life in his hand, lying down to sleep at the end of a weary day, with the knowledge that if his camp-fires were not watched he might wake"], [294, "286 THE VENETIANS. to find himself face to face with a lion. Oh, what a life for him to lead, for him whose days had been spent so pleasantly in the busy idleness of a man whose only occupation is the care of a small landed estate, and whose only notion of hard work is the early rising in the season of cub-hunting, or the strenuous pleasures of salmon fishing beyond the Scottish border. When her prayer was done \u2014 her prayer that her beloved might be sheltered and guarded by a Power which guides the forces of Nature, and bridles the neck of the lion, and can disperse the pestilence with a breath \u2014 prayer is a dead letter for those who believe not as much as this \u2014 Eve sat upon the grass, under her Italian umbrella, the red umbrella which all the peasants use as shelter from sun and rain, and abandoned herself to thoughts of the wanderer. She knew more of his wanderings than she had hoped to know when Sophy's letter from Fern hurst first told her that he was travelling with a friend in the Mashona country; thanks to an occasional letter from his own pen which appeared in the Field, and over which his wife hung with breathless interest, and read and re-read, return-"], [295, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 287 ing to it again and again long after the date of publication, as she returned to Hamlet or \"In Memoriam.\" Week after week she searched the paper eagerly for any new letter, or any stray paragraph giving news of the wanderer ; but the letters appeared at long intervals, and the last was nearly three months old. He had turned his face homeward, he said, in that last letter. Her heart thrilled at the thought that he might have returned ere now, that he might be at Merewood perhaps, in the rooms where they had lived together, in the garden which was once their earthly Paradise, in which she had watched the growth of every flowering shrub, and counted every rose, in that mild Hampshire where roses flourish almost as abundantly as in balmyDevon. She thought of the tulip tree she had planted on their favourite lawn, he standing beside her as she bent to her work, laughingly prophetic of the day when they should sit on a rustic bench together under the spreading branches of that sapling of to-day, to accept the congratulations of garden-party guests upon their golden wedding. \" ' We must really go and speak to the old"], [296, "288 THE VENETIANS. people,' some pert young visitor would say to a perter granddaughter of the house, 'only one hardly knows what to say to people of that pro digious age.' \" Eve remembered her feeling of vague wonder what it was like to be old, whilst Vansittart jestingly forecast the future. Well, all speculation of that kind was at an end now. She would never know what it was like. \" Those the Gods love die young,\" she repeated to herself, dreamily. \" I would not mind dying \u2014 any more than Peggy minded, happy-souled Peggy \u2014 if I could but see him before I die. There could be no harm in my seeing him \u2014 just at the end \u2014 no treason to my flesh and blood lying here.\" She laid her wasted cheek gently down on the mound, and let her tears mix with the last lingering dew on the long grass. She wanted to be loyal to her dead; but her heart yearned with a sick yearning for one touch from the hand of the living, for one look from the eyes that would look only love. Love, and ipardon, and fond regret."], [297, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 289 It was a fortnight after that morning in the cemetery at San Michele, that in poring over her Field Eve came upon a two-line paragraph at the bottom of a column, a most obscure little paragraph \u2014 side by side with one of those little anecdotes of intensest human interest which chill one at the end by the fatal symbol, \" Advt.\" \u2014 a tiny scrap of news which any but the most searching reader would have been likely to over look. \" Among the passengers on board the City of Zanzibar, which left Cape Town on the 3rd inst., for Alexandria and Brindisi, were Mr. Murthwait and Mr. Vansittart, returning from a hunting expedition to Lobengula's country.\" Eve sent for her doctor that evening, the English doctor who had attended her at St. Moritz in January and February, and who was now taking a semi-professional holiday in Venice \u2014 willing to see old patients who might have drifted to the city in the sea, but not desiring new ones.

But it is not of that I am thinking. Oh, doctor, be frank with me. I have a reason for wanting to know. Do you think that I am dying?\" \" Alas, dear lady ! I cannot promise you many years of life.\" \"Or many months? Or many weeks? Oh, doctor, don't think I am afraid of the truth. I am not one of those consumptives who deceive themselves. I have no spurious hopes \u2014 perhaps because I do not set a great value on life. Only there is some one I want to see before I die.\" \" Send for him, then,\" said the doctor, divining that the some one was her husband. \" Send for him, and set your mind at rest.\" \" I will,\" she answered resolutely, and before the doctor had left her half an hour she had written and despatched her telegram \u2014 \"John Vansittart, Steamer City of Zanzibar, Poste Restante, Brindisi. \u2014 I am at Venice, and would give much to see you on your way home. \u2014 Eve. \u2014 Danieli's.\""], [300, "292 THE VENETIANS. The windows of Mrs. Vansittart's salon on the entresol at Danieli's opened upon a balcony \u2014 a balcony shaded and sheltered by a striped awning, under which Eve loved to sit at her ease, nestling among the cushions which Hetty arranged for her, on days when, in her own words, she felt hardly equal to the gondola. There had been many days since the despatch of that message to Brindisi when Eve had felt unequal to the gondola, and Hetty had by this time exhausted all the sights of Venice under the chaperonage of Benson \u2014 who gave herself as many airs as if she had been Ruskin \u2014 and had yawned as heartily at the Accademia as ever she had done at the National Gallery. She had wearied of Titian and Tintoretto. She had tried her hardest to admire Carpaccio, and to pin her mind to her limp little piratical edition of the \" Stones of Venice.\" She thought of Ruskin religiously every day as she tripped past Fig tree Corner. More fondly, perhaps, did she affect the shops in the Merceria, and all those wonderful little streets which to the Cockney of mature years recall all that was most precious \u2014 that is to say, most characteristic of the little"], [301, "293 \"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" industries and little 'trades of a great city \u2014 in the vanishing alleys and paved courts between Leicester Square and Oxford Street. Here there was always something to interest the girl from Sussex ; and the Rialto, market and bridge, afforded never-failing pleasure. Thus the gon dolier had an easy time of it, and yawned and slept away the brightening hours, and basked in the sun, and fattened on golden messes of polenta. It was quite true that Eve felt less capable of exertion \u2014 even that slight effort of going down stairs and stepping from Danieli's doorstep into a gondola \u2014 than when first she came to Venice ; but she had another and stronger reason for pre ferring her cushioned nest on the balcony to the Lido or the lagunes, lovely as those smooth waters were in the lovely May weather. She was waiting for the result of her telegram, she was watching for the coming of her husband. He would come to her. On that question she had no fear. If he lived to land at Brindisi and to receive her message, he would come to Venice. She would see him, and forgive, and be forgiven, before she died. Forgive him ; forgive the"], [302, "294 THE VENETIANS. wrong done to another ? For her own part there had never been anything less than pardon in her mind. She had made every excuse that love can make \u2014 love, the special pleader \u2014 the in fallible advocate for a criminal at the court of a woman's conscience. She had excused his crime until it was no crime ; but she had been firm in her conviction that she could not live with the man who killed her brother. Looking back now at the years of a double exile there was no wavering in her mind, no regret for what she had done. She felt only gratitude to Provi dence who had shortened the lonely years, and brought the end so near. Three weeks of watching and waiting passed like a slow pensive dream \u2014 a dream of blue water \u2014 and lounging gondoliers \u2014 and flower girls with baskets of ragged pink peonies, and the shriek and whistle of the steamer for the Lido, and the passing of many footsteps, and sound of many voices, grey-coated tourists, American and British, for ever coming and going, so light-hearted, so light-minded, so noisy, that one might think care and sorrow had no part in their lives or in their memories. To"], [303, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 295 Eve, dwelling for ever on the memory of the life which had been, on the thought of the parting which was to be, all that tumultuous movement and gaiety seemed a thing of wonder. \" How happy they all are ! \" she said. \" What a happy world it seems \u2014 for other people.\" \"Ah, but you see people must wear their happy side outermost,\" answered Hetty, \"and I dare say even Americans know what care means, though they always seem wallowing in money and new clothes. I wish you would come down to the hall to-night, and hear the little concert we have eveiy evening, and see my favourite young lady from Boston. She has all her frocks from Worth or Redfern, and her waist is under nineteen inches. Yet she eats ! Ah, what a privilege to be able to eat as much as she does, and yet keep one's waist under nineteen inches!\" The day had been almost oppressively warm, and the fishing-boats were coming home through a sea of molten gold in the unspeakable splendour of a Venetian sunset, when May has breathed the first breath of summer heat over land and water. Eve had been sitting in the balcony all day reading those little books of Howells' and his"], [304, "296 THE VENETIANS. contemporaries, which seem especially invented for the traveller in fair countries, light, portable, dainty to touch and gracious to look upon, and eminently proper. She had read, and dreamed her waking dreams, and dozed a good deal at intervals \u2014 for her nights now were sadly broken, and sadly wakeful \u2014 quite as bad as poor Miss Margaret's nights, as Benson told her sympa thetically. Miss Margaret? Who was Miss Margaret ? And then Eve remembered how the respectful Benson had insisted on calling poor Peggy by a name which no other lips had ever addressed to her. Benson was an admirable nurse, wakeful, watch ful, really attached to her mistress ; but she was just a shade too business-like, and too much inclined to look upon Eve as a case rather than an individual. She watched the symptoms of decay with a ghoulish gusto, and told her mistress more about former patients than it was cheering for an invalid to know. To-day, after the weariness of the night, and the long, long hours between the early dawn and the breakfast hour of civilization, Eve's fitful"], [305, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 297 slumbers were sound and deep, deeper than dreamland, deep as the dark abyss of uncon sciousness. She had been falling into this gulf now and again all day, falling suddenly from her book or her day-dream into that distant world of restfulness. A cooler breeze sprang up with the sinking of the sun, and the water between the Riva and the island church was stirred into bolder ripples as the black boats stood sharply out against the reddening light. The salt breath of the Adriatic was blowing across the sandy bar yonder with revivifying freshness. Eve rose from her nest of down pillows in the low canvas chair, and stood leaning against the balcony, looking at the animated scene. There was a paper lantern lighted here and there with a pale fantastic light, in sickly contrast to that blaze of sunset colour, and as the crimson faded in the low western sky the little earthly lights brightened and grew bold, and there came the sound of that light music which Venetians love, music that seems only a natural accompaniment to the ripple of the incoming tide. \" How bright and gay it all looks ! \" said Eve."], [306, "298 THE VENETIANS. \" Is there anything on earth to equal Venice ? Oh, how strange that I should love this city so well ! \" she murmured, in self-reproach, remem bering the purpose that had brought her there. The charm of the city had crept upon her unawares. She was glad to live there, glad that she was to die there. She looked towards the bridge by the Doge's Palace, and saw a man walking quickly down the steps \u2014 a bearded man, with a brown skin and a weather-beaten look. He was coming quickly towards the hotel ; he was looking up at the windows, scanning the wide frontage with a sweeping glance, now high, now low, till his eyes lighted on the balcony where she stood, lighted on herself, and never unfixed their gaze. Changed as he was, she had known him from the first instant. She had known him when he appeared at the top of the steps for John Vansit tart and no other. There was something in his walk, something in the carriage of his head, something which to the eyes of love seemed to distinguish him from all the rest of the world \u2014"], [307, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 299 characteristics that would have been invisible to all other eyes. He ran towards the low doorway, and scarcely had he vanished from the outer world below when she heard a door bang at the end of the corridor and the rush of hurrying feet. How quick, how impetuous, what a creature of fire and flame he seemed as he dashed into the room and clasped her in his arms. \" Are these your African manners ? \" she gasped, laughing and crying in the same mo ment. \" Oh, my love, my love, how sweet to hold you on my heart again and be forgiven ! I am for given, am I not, dear? My calamity, or my crime \u2014 call it what you will \u2014 is forgiven. Oh, love, I have suffered. I have drunk the cup of atonement.\" She was sobbing upon his shoulder, her face hidden, as she clung to him, with wasted arms wreathing his neck. In the blindness of his joy \u2014 for joy, like fortune, is stone blind \u2014 he had not noticed how pitiably thin those caressing arms had grown. Suddenly, scared by her silence, he withdrew himself from that caress, and held"], [308, "300 THE VENETIANS. her from him at arm's length, and, looking into her face, saw the sign manual of death, and knew why she had summoned him. By a heroic effort he commanded his counte nance, and smiled faintly back her own faint smile. \" There is no forgiveness between you and me,\" she said, \" only love, a world of love.\" He drew her to his breast again, cradling the thin cheek against his brown and bearded counte nance, holding her to him as if he would never let go his hold, would hold her there against the grim assailant Death, breathing his own strong life into her as their lips met and their breath mingled. Surely between them there was life and vigour enough to ward off Death. \" My darling, my darling, my darling ! \" It [was all that he could say just yet. The rapture of reunion, the agony of an unspeakable dread were storming heart and mind. He felt like a man lashed to the mast in a hurricane, all the forces of Nature warring round him, unable to measure his danger or his chance of rescue. To have her, to hold her again, loving him as of old. And then to lose her! But must he"], [309, "\"HE HER GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 301 lose her ? -Could neither love nor science work a miracle, and snatch her from the jaws of the Destroyer ? He grew calmer presently, and they sat side by side in the deepening shadows, and began to talk to each other quietly, in soft hushed voices, while the music and the voices of the Riva mixed with their half-whispered sentences, and the footsteps went by with a gay spring in them as if all Venice were hurrying from pleasure to pleasure. \" Oh, dearest, it was time you sent for me ; it was time,\" he said. \" You have given me a long penance. Nothing but Africa could have helped me to bear my life. In a world less full of strange hazards I must have lost patience with calamity, and made a swift and sudden end of myself. Thanks to the Dark Continent I have lived some how, as you see, and come back a semi-savage, a creature of thews and sinews.\" \" No, you are only rougher looking and browner. I can see the soul shining through your eyes. Africa has not altered that.\" \" But you, dear love,\" he said, with a thrill in his voice that marked the strangled sob, \"you"], [310, "302 THE VENETIANS. are altered. You are looking tired and ill. I am afraid you have been neglecting yourself. I shall take you to the Engadine, where we ought to have taken poor Peggy. The Riviera was a mistake. A winter at St. Moritz would have cured her. We will start to-morrow.\" She did not answer for a minute or so, but nestled nearer to him, with her wan cheek lean ing against his shoulder, and her waxen fingers clasping his strong wrist, hardened and roughened by hard weather and hard toil. \" The Engadine can do nothing for me, Jack \u2014 no more than it could have done for Peggy. South or north, mountain or valley, the end would have been the same. It is our family history, Jack. We were doomed from our birth. I was sent to the Engadine last winter, and Hetty and I only left St. Moritz in March. We stayed at Varese for nearly a month, and then came here. Hetty is with me, so bright, so active, so happy; but some day perhaps she will look in the glass as I have looked, and will see the summons written on her face. Dear husband, don't be too sorry for me. This parting must have come, even if we had escaped the other"], [311, "\"HE HEB GOD, SHE HIS IDOL.\" 303 even if I had never known what happened at Florian's ; never knelt beside my brother's grave in the island cemetery.

Two days after, he took her away from the life and movement of the Riva to a palace on the Grand Canal, where the quiet of the Silent City had a soothing influence on her overwrought spirit. If any life could have been happy in which the inevitable end was so near, theirs would have been happy in that delicious beginning of the Venetian summer, a season when mere exist ence is a privilege.
