Janet and Tiny are my sisters. Tiny's name is really Harriet, but every one has always called her \"Tiny,\" because she is such a little thing. She is nineteen years old, two years older than I am, and she only comes up to my shoulder. I know I am very long and lanky for my age ; unfortunately so, I have heard papa say ; but Tiny is little all over, like a fairy. Janet is twenty, and so wise and good. Deborah was our old nurse, and she died six months ago. She lived to be eighty-five, and had lost none of her faculties. I wonder if this is the right way to begin a book. Because Janet and Tiny say a nice one might be made of what Deborah has told us from time to time of our family, which she has known and lived in from her childhood ; but they must be laughing at me, or they would never have chosen me, the youngest and stupidest, to write it. It must be B"], [14, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 2 very pleasant to write a book too, and if papa likes mine, that is all I care about, for I do not suppose any one but he and my sisters will ever read it. I think I will begin by putting down what I can remember of the first story (the first true one, I mean) that Deborah ever told us. I was eight years old at the time, and Janet and Tiny eleven and ten. Mamma had been dead ten months, and we still wore our black frocks trimmed with crape for her. Papa was in the City at his business all day, and we lived at Blackheath, and had a daily governess. One day in winter, in the year 1856, when we had done all our lessons, and were waiting as usual to hear papa's ring before we went down stairs, Deborah came into the school-room, as she often did at that hour, to \"see after us,\" as she said, and sat down by the fire. I, being the youngest, climbed into her lap, and asked for a story, while Janet and Tiny sat down on the rug, and said, \" Oh, do, Nurse, please ! a nice long story.\" But I suppose I ought to wait a little, and describe us all just as we looked and listened, for I recollect it well, better than some things which happened much later. First, there was Deborah, a spare, shrewd looking old woman, past seventy even then, but quite active and alert, with a sensible, marked face, which I always thought was handsome,"], [15, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 3 though Tiny says that was a mistake. She was dressed in black, and wore a large white muslin cap with a curious crimped border, which I never saw on anybody's cap but Deborah's. Every plait of that cap was dear to my child's heart, and I had a queer habit of associating all Deborah's virtues with it ; so that I imagined the cap to be a part of herself, and that if she ever parted with it she would lose her own peculiar identity, and be \u2014 well, just like any other nurse. This was not a mere fancy, but a real belief when I was eight years old. I was on her lap \u2014 a little pale child with a short crop of hair curling over my head like a boy ; for I had had it all cut off when I had the scarlet fever at the time mamma died, and it was not grown again then. Janet and Tiny sat nestled together on the rug. I remember Janet's face was much the same then as it is now ; just as grave, and sweet, and tender. Her hair was the same dark, wavy mass, only it hung over her shoulders in curls instead of being put up in a net as she now wears it ; and her eyes \u2014 but it would be foolish for me to try to describe Janet's eyes. I could only say that they are dark grey, and clear and long-shaped, and so are a hun dred other eyes without being at all like Janet's. Is it that she sees God in everything which makes them so deep and loving ? I do not know; but they make her beautiful to my mind, though she is not really pretty like Tiny. Tiny's hair was quite"], [16, "MY OWN PEOPLE. \u2666 golden in the fire-light ; it is darker now, though it has the gleam in it still, and it was all brushed off her face and tied with a black ribbon. Her eyes were blue and bright, and mischievous as they are now, and her skin of the same beautiful pink and white. It was winter, I have said, and twilight. I can recollect the feeling of safety and perfect content and comfort with which I, cradled in Nurse's lap, looked dreamily at the wavering light which the fire threw over the room, and at the gloom and chill of the January sky. Something \u2014 I hardly know what, made me whisper, \"Nursie, how did you come to be our nursie ? Tell us your own story, please.\" \" My own story ! \" was her answer, a little slowly spoken. \" I have no story, none at least that you would understand or care for. Every life is a story, I suppose, Miss Mabel ; but some are worth telling and some are not, and mine was not worth much to any one but myself. If you like, I will tell you the first life story that ever came to my knowledge, which happened to one of your great aunts when I was a girl only sixteen. It is short enough and sad enough, and I don't know why it seems to come to my mind to-night. Would you like to hear it ? \" I said \"Yes,\" with a child's confidence in a \"story\" being always delightful, in spite of this preface of Nurse's, which I did not under stand."], [17, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 5 \" I don't think a great aunt's story can be very nice,\" suggested Tiny doubtfully ; but Janet said softly, \"Nurse wants to tell it, and she was quite young, you know, Tiny, though she was our great aunt. Why, think of Nursie only sixteen ! \" So Nurse settled herself, and began."], [18, "I I WAS born in 1782. My father was a sailor, and was killed, fighting against the French and Spaniards, before I was born. My mother died soon after, and I was left an orphan, Deborah Standish, on the wide world. People call it a cruel world, but, thank God, I did not find it so. My uncle, who was a small yeoman farmer in Dorsetshire, took me to live with him, as he had neither wife nor child, and when I was sixteen years old I went to be still-room maid to the family at the Manor House, where your great grandfather lived, a mile from my uncle's farm. There were several young ladies (their mother had been long dead), and among them one whom I wondered about daily. So young, so pretty, so beautifully dressed, and yet to look so sad ! I knew afterwards that she was at that time engaged to marry her cousin, who was at sea, fighting the French with Lord Nelson. I had been there a few months, and I was one fine morning occupied in the still-room laying out stalks of lavender to dry in the sun, when I heard a strange man's voice in the kitchen. I was never"], [19, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 7 curious, nor fond of gossip, so I went on with what I was doing, and presently forgot to wonder whose the voice could be. By and by I saw Miss Agatha \u2014 that was the name of the young lady I have told you of \u2014 pass the window quickly with something white, that looked like an open letter, in her hand, and almost immediately after I heard a strange cry like that of a person in great agony. I felt a little fearful, and my heart beat, but I was sure the cry must have something to do with Miss Agatha, and I darted out of the glass door into the garden plat, and on into the alley beyond the yew hedge ; and oh ! I shall never forget the piteous sight I saw. Miss Agatha leant against the yew hedge, which was as thick and solid as a wall, with a face as white as the paper she held so tightly clenched in her poor hands. Her eyes were wide open and looking straight before her, but they saw some thing I could not see, and there was a horror in them which gave me a thrill, I could not tell why. I ran forward ; and, though I had hardly spoken to her before, I held out my hands now, and cried out her name. She did not seem to hear me, and did not answer nor move. I went up close to her and put my arm round her, for I was frightened at her face. I said, \" Come in-doors, Miss Agatha ; please do. Speak to me. Can I help you, dear Miss Agatha ? \" for I had taken a strange fancy to her from the moment I had seen her ; and yet I don't know why I should call it strange, for sure no one"], [20, "8 MY OWN PEOPLE. was ever so patient and good. Still she never spoke for all my words, only turned her eyes wonderingly upon me, as if she could understand nothing. So, with my arm still round her for fear she should faint or fall, I led her into the still-room and sprinkled her face with some of the essences which were there. Presently she gave a great shudder and laid her head on my shoulder. Her lips moved a little, and as I bent down my head I heard her say faintly, \" The letter ! \" \"You have got it, Miss Agatha, safe in your hand. Shall I call any one ? \" \"Yes; Ann.\" Miss Ann was her eldest sister, and she was the youngest ; so there was a great difference between them. I went for her, and when she came, Miss Agatha fell into her arms with a burst of tears, and I left them alone together. It wa's as I thought. There had been a great sea-fight and victory ; but Miss Agatha's cousin was killed on board the admiral's ship, and the letter had been sent home by one of his sailors to tell her about it. She never held up her head afterwards. \" Let me go somewhere,\" was her constant cry when she had got a little better of the illness that seized her after she heard the fatal news ; \" I can't get well while I stay here.\" Her father and sisters were loth she should go, for in those days people did not move about as they do now, and a journey was a serious thing. Then I thought of my uncle's house, which, though a poor"], [21, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 9 enough place, after the Manor, was roomy and pretty, and close by ; and with many apologies for my boldness, I told Miss Ann of it, and said I was sure my uncle would be honoured if his two best rooms might be put in order for Miss Agatha. When her sister named it to her, her pale face gave the first look approaching to pleasure which I had seen upon it since her illness, and she said I must come too and be with her. I think the knowledge that none of her family had wished her to marry her cousin, made her shy of her sisters' company, for all they were very tender and affec tionate to her ; at all events she did not say much when I said I was afraid we could not manage to lodge any one but herself, and seemed anxious and uneasy until I went home to see after matters, and to air and get ready the rooms. When that was done she was brought over, and I took the place of regular waiting-maid to her, which I kept till she died. Ah me ! it was not for long. She died that summer. One of her sisters or her father came to see her every day, but I think she liked best to be alone. She liked to be brought from her bed-room into the long parlour, with its wainscoted walls painted white, and its blue chintz hangings ; and to be propped up by pillows in the great easy chair by the open window, where she could breathe the sweet air that came up from beneath ; and one such evening, she would have me lay by my sewing and sit by her. \" Deborah,\" she said, \" when I am dead, I should"], [22, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 10 like some of your sweet flowers planted over my grave.\" \" Oh, Miss Agatha ! \" was all the answer I could give for crying. \" Don't cry, there's a good girl. I am afraid I am not brave, Deborah. I did not know how to face the world alone, without him, and God is very good to let me die.\" It was the first time she had ever spoken in my hearing of her dead lover, and I felt I ought to say nothing. I could only sit and listen. She went on. \" Deborah, I have never looked at that letter since; I could not. I think I can read it to-night.\" \"Where is it, miss ? \" I asked. \" I have got it here,\" she said, laying her hand on her bosom. I made a movement to go. \" No,\" she said, \" don't go. I think you love me, Deborah r \" \" Oh, miss ! I would die to do you any good ! \" I said passionately. \" I shall be the one to die, Deborah,\" said she with a faint smile ; \" but I asked you because I want you to do for me what I can speak of to no one else.\" It gave my heart a thrill to think she should trust me so. \" I want you to lay this letter on my breast when I am dead, and see that I am buried with it.\" I forced back the tears from my eyes and the"], [23, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 11 sobs from my voice, as I promised to do as she wished, and then took up my work, and moved away from the window while she drew the letter from its place, and read it once, twice, three times. After the third time she let it lie upon her lap, and looked intently out at the glorious evening sky. She sat so for half an hour without moving, but at last she turned round, and seeing me looking anxiously at her, gave me a smile, quite a happy one ; and replacing the letter, let me help her to bed. A week after that evening, she was lying in her coffin, with white roses strewn over her, and the letter on her breast. \" She was my first mistress,\" said Nurse, wiping her eyes, \" and when she died, I went back to the Manor House. But I need not tell you anything more about myself, for you asked me how and when I came into your family, and I have an swered you ; and, as I said before, I have no story of my own. My life has been so mixed up with those of my mistresses, that I never could think of them apart. I never shall now, please God ! But I often sit and think over the different stories I have watched in my time ; stories quite as pretty, some of them, and quite as sad too, as you will find in story-books ; and, my dears, if you ever want to hear any of them, come and ask me. It is good now and then to be reminded that there have been other hopes and joys, and other sorrows and strug gles too besides our own.\""], [24, "12 WE have used Deborah's permission often and often, and have learned many things, some interesting, some amusing, many sorrowful, from her lips about our different relations. I cannot pretend to put down these stories, either in their exact order, or in Nurse's phraseology, which in deed would be as tiresome to read as to write ; so when I make her speak, I will, if you please, use my own language and grammar, which, although they may not be very good or correct, will, at least, be more so than dear old Deborah's. Also, I had better explain, once for all, that the family at the Manor House consisted, when De borah first went to live with them, of five daugh ters, our great aunts : Ann, Dorothy, Charlotte, Mabel, and Agatha. Their mother had died when they were infants, and their father was then about sixty-five \u2014 a gracious, kindly-hearted English gen tleman, loving fox-hunting and hating the French, who were then keeping England in constant dread of invasion, and Europe all in a flame. Dorothy, Charlotte, and Mabel all married ; but Ann, the eldest, remained single, and became the"], [25, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 13 dear, good, loved, and revered old maid, whom Janet says she should like to resemble. I should like to be good and loved and revered too, but I don't know about being an old maid. It seems to me a dreary, desolate kind of life, and there is so much ridicule attaching to it, though Janet says the ridicule only comes from silly and frivolous people. But it must be so forlorn to outlive, as Aunt Ann did, all one's nearest relations, and to be of no particular interest to any one. Oh, yes ! I think it must be very sad to be an old maid. There was only one really exciting event in all Aunt Ann's life of seventy years, and that I must relate as Deborah told it to us. After Miss Agatha's death, Miss Ann, the eldest and plainest of the five sisters, and who had been very much attached to Miss Agatha, grew to dis like going out as the others did, and kept very much at home. She had never been so bright and happy-looking as they were, or rather she had always had the lines of what I often thought must have been a great, hidden sorrow, on her brow and about her mouth. When I went back to the Hall after that sorrowful month at home, she grew still quieter, and the lines deepened. But that might be grief for her lost sister ; and at any rate it did not become me to pry into my young ladies' concerns, so I said nothing to any one about Miss Ann's low spirits. She liked to have me about her, and when I had nothing but"], [26, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 14 my needlework to do, which was a great deal more in those days \u2014 when ladies wore such a deal of lace and worked frilling \u2014 than it is now, she would often tell me to sit in her room, and she would be in and out and talk to me, sometimes on one thing and sometimes on another. One evening Miss Dorothy, Miss Charlotte, and Miss Mabel had gone to a great ball at one of the neighbouring houses ; and the weather being bad and the roads rough, they were to sleep there, and come back the next day. I was pretty well tired after getting my young ladies ready and helping the hairdresser powder and dress their hair, and it being past five o'clock, I went to lie down on my bed for a little time before supper. I had not been lying there long, and was in a half doze, when I was startled by my door being suddenly opened, and Miss Ann looked in. I was on my feet in a moment. She held her hand to her lips. \" Deborah, are you ill ? \" she said, in an agitated way and in low tones. \" I have only you to look to!\" \" What is it, Miss Ann ? \" Hush ! \" She came quite into the room, shut the door carefully, and then sate down on my bed, while I stood and waited for what might come. \"Deborah,\" she said, still speaking low, \"I think you are prudent, and I know you are faithful. I have something to tell you which will require both. You never knew that I have a brother.\""], [27, "MY OWN PEOPLE. \u25a05 I was very much surprised ; for though I had heard some gossip about a \" young squire,\" I had never given it any heed, and indeed I had for gotten it; so I only said, \"No, miss, I never knew.\" \" Well, unhappily my brother offended my father by going abroad and marrying a French lady. It happened eleven years ago, and we have never seen him since. He has sent a servant over from Paris, who arrived here this afternoon with a letter to tell me that affairs are so threatening in France, that he is going immediately to send his wife and son to England. He asks me if my father will receive her, and I fear \u2014 I know he will not. And yet I cannot bear to think she should be exposed to such danger as she will doubtless en counter if she remains in France. I am distracted ! Deborah, do you think she and her boy could come to your uncle's till I can break the news to my father r \" \" Yes, surely, miss,\" I answered. \" Poor lady ! I have heard tell that French ladies can't do with out a great deal of dancing and gaiety, and she won't get much of that ; but maybe she'll be too glad to be safe in England to heed it, miss.\" \" Oh, yes, Deborah, you need not fear ; and from all I know, she is quiet, and sweet, and good, and will be very happy with her boy. I will write then speedily, for the messenger must get back to Paris as soon as possible, and you must go and prepare your uncle ; and warn \u2014 or no, there is no need,"], [28, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 16 since even you had never heard the miserable secret he knows so well. I know I may trust you,\" and she took my hand and wrung it hard. I had never seen her so moved. As she got up hurriedly from the bed, I heard her say half to herself, \" I trust I am doing right. God help me ! I hope it is not wrong.\" Wrong ! I could not help speaking out then. \" No, miss,\" I said boldly ; \" it can't be wrong to help one's own kith and kin, or to help any one who is in danger ! It would be more wrong, to my mind, if you were to leave them to those murderous Frenchmen, who are no better than savages. That would be a sin ; it never can be one to help those that need help.\" Miss Ann turned and looked at me rather sur prised, and I thought she might be angry at my bold speaking, though I couldn't have helped it if she had been angry ten times over; but she said, \" God bless you, Deborah, I think you are right, but my father must not know ; at least,- not now. Go, there's a good girl, as soon as you can.\" As I opened the door for her she passed her hand over her eyes and face, as if to clear from them the traces of doubt and anxiety ; but the lines I spoke of looked deeper than ever. I knew the reason of them now. I was soon on my way home. It was a lonesome bit of road, but as pretty as any you could find in England, and one I loved well to walk, winter or summer. It was drawing towards spring then, but"], [29, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 17 the road, which wound for a quarter of a mile down the side of a hill, was still littered with golden brown leaves from the beeches which drooped over it ; for the enclosed ground to the left was part of the Manor House grounds, and was planted with noble old beech-trees, which had flourished there, so people said, for hundreds of years. The wind blew among the branches with a mournful sound, and it was getting dark as I walked quickly down the hill; but I had too much to think of to feel melancholy, and my thoughts ran on pretty nearly as fast as my legs did when I came to the level ground. It seemed so strange that I had never heard of my master's son ! How well the servants and village people must have kept the secret, if they knew it ! More from fear of the squire's anger than from anything else, I suspected, for he was always a hasty gentleman, and his anger would be very sharp while it lasted. Then I fell to wonder ing what the poor French lady would be like. It makes me laugh now to remember the odd fancies I had about her, but I knew no better at the time. I had never seen a foreigner \u2014 they were not plen tiful in England then \u2014 and I was not at all clear that she would even have a white skin. Then as for food, instead of good beef and mutton, or the great plum-puddings, the savoury pies, and the fine rich custards of the Hall, she was no doubt accustomed to frogs, and to what our cook called \"kickshaws;\" nasty, unwholesome things, no doubt. C"], [30, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 18 I was thinking deeply about the supply of frogs in Uncle Roger's ponds, and the way they should be caught and cooked, when I found myself at home. Uncle Roger was at the door with his pipe when I arrived, out of breath with quick walking, and unable to say a word at first in reply to his astonished questions. \" Why, Deb, what's the matter ? Quick, lass ! Is anything wrong at the Hall ?\" \" No, not exactly,\" I gasped out ; and then sat for two full minutes to recover myself, while Uncle Roger puffed at his pipe and looked at me with eyes growing rounder and rounder, till I was able to say, \u2014 \" I'm come to get Miss Agatha's rooms ready, uncle.\" (We always called them by her name now.) \" Miss Ann begged me to do so. She is in great trouble, for the young squire's wife is coming over here, or she'll be murdered by the Frenchmen.\" \" The young squire's wife ! \" repeated Uncle Roger very slowly, his eyes growing wider, if possible, than before. \" So you know that ! How women tattle I\" \" Oh, uncle ! Miss Ann told me herself; I never heard a word before, an d I ouldn't tattle for the world. She said she knew she could trust me.\" \"Well, well, then,\" said Uncle Roger, looking pleased as I said that, in spite of gruff words, \" don't begin now ; walls have ears ;\" and he shut the door. \" When is she coming ? \" \" As soon as she can. Miss Ann could not rightly"], [31, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 19 say, because of the danger of travelling ; but the messenger who brought the letter from the young \" \" Hush !\" said my uncle, rapping his pipe on the table to empty the ashes, and putting it in his pocket ; \" no need to name him. It will do no good, and it may do harm. The messenger ? \" \" Went just now,\" I whispered. \" May not I ask what his name is, uncle ? \" \"Well, there's not any law against it that I know of,\" said my uncle, his face relaxing into a smile ; \" and you'll get to know somehow if I don't tell you, I suppose. It's Herbert \u2014 Master Herbert \u2014 who's half-broke his father's heart, and quite broke his mother's.\" \" Oh, uncle !\" I cried. \" It's truth,\" he said, in a low, sad voice. \" She never held up her head after the squire found out what he had done, and cast him off. But come, \u2014 I'll go with you to the house, and talk to Miss Ann.\" I was glad of Uncle Roger's company, for it had grown quite dark, and the road, as I have said, was lonesome. As we went, I could not help puzzling and wondering to myself why the squire should be so angry with Master Herbert, and could come to no conclusion. There was no law that I ever heard of against marrying foreigners for them who liked it ; and Miss Ann had said she was good and gentle. Miss Ann was not angry. She was grieved and pitiful. At last I asked timidly, for"], [32, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 20 I was almost afraid of the subject by this time, \" Uncle Roger, why was the squire so angry r \" \" Well,\" said he, \" twasn't likely that the squire would like to see a lot of French people at the house, and to know that they who lived there would be half-foreign like when he was dead and gone. These foreigners have strange, outlandish ways, I've heard tell ; and though the young lady might be all well enough, she would have got rela tions, of course. But the worst of it is, that she's a Papist.\" \" Oh, poor thing ! How dreadful !\" \" Ay,\" said my uncle, tramping on, \" that's where it was ; she might as well have been a heathen, pretty nigh. That's what angered the squire so, and hurt the mistress. Not, mind you, that I'm saying the squire's in the right now. Let bygones be bygones, /say; and it's her bringing up and not her fault, poor thing. Maybe she'd have turned, and made a right good English Protestant after all, if she had been brought over here.\" \"It was very wrong of the squire,\" I said decidedly, for I was always a terrible hand at speaking my mind when I was a girl, and I was frightened a moment afterwards at the sound of my own words. \"You're quite out there, Deb, if that's your thought,\" said uncle angrily. \"There's nothing to hinder the squire from doing what he likes with his own flesh and blood that I know on ; and you'd better keep a straighter tongue in"], [33, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 21 your head if you want to stay at the house, I'm thinking.\" I didn't dare say another word after that, though my mind was not one whit altered. It was a strange fancy, but as Uncle Roger tramped on over a heap of dead beech-leaves \u2014 crushing some, and kicking others out right and left with his heavy boots \u2014 the thought would come into my head that he was thinking of Frenchmen and Papists, and wishing it was as easy to tread them under foot as the poor, brown leaves. Late dinners had not come into fashion then, and when Uncle Roger and I reached the house, Miss Ann was at supper with her father in the small brown parlour. I knew she would ask if I had come back when the meal was over, and the squire asleep, for he often slept most part of the evenings, especially after a long day's shooting or hunting ; so I left Uncle Roger in the servants' hall and ran up-stairs, that I might be within call. In about half an hour Miss Ann came into her room, and started violently when she saw me. \"Deborah ! I thought you were gone this long time.\" I told her I had been home, and that Uncle Roger had stepped up to speak to her. \" Where will you see him, miss r\" I added. \" Show him into the dining-parlour,\" said she ; \" and let no one come in, Deborah ;\" and she came slowly down-stairs after me, looking very pale, went"], [34, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 22 into the dining-parlour, and shut the door, while I went for Uncle Roger. I never knew what passed between them in the half-hour they were together ; I only know that Miss Ann's face, when she came out of the room, looked much brighter and more hopeful than it had done when she went in ; but Uncle Roger, on the contrary, looked troubled and even angry. He never spoke a word as I walked back with him (for I was to go and see about pre paring the rooms), but I heard him muttering to himself after we had got home, and I was bustling about the kitchen, and once I thought I caught the words, \" The squire's in the wrong, after all,\" but I could not feel quite sure after what he had said to me. For the next four days I was at home putting everything into order, not without a sore heart, and some tears, with thinking of dear Miss Agatha, and the last time I had done the same thing. I looked out the best curtains and chair-covers, blue chintz, with a primrose border, which Miss Agatha used to admire so much ; and I washed the white dimity bed-furniture with the ball fringe, and put it all up myself. Then I rubbed up the little oak table which stood in the corner of the sitting-room until it shone like glass, and set out upon it the tiny cups and saucers, no bigger than doll's things, which Uncle Ned, who had been a sailor and was dead, brought home from some strange country he had visited ; and, lastly, I bethought me of some old pictures which had long lain in a press in the store closet, and rummaged them out and got Uncle"], [35, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 23 Roger to hang them on the walls of the bedroom, that it might look cheerful, for it was all oak, and not gaily papered like the parlour. There was one of a ship in full sail, with the name the Merry Andrew underneath ; and two smaller ones in black varnished frames, of a soldier and a sailor, each looking very trim and smart, and I thought them pretty enough then, though I think now their waists were too small, and their cheeks too highly coloured to be natural. But the best picture of all was a painting of a lady in a straw hat, with long auburn curls hanging from under it, a white satin gown, and a necklace of pearls in her hand tied with a blue riband. It had been given to my uncle years before as part payment of a bad debt, and I believe people who understood such things said it was very valuable. Certainly when I had got Uncle Roger to put it up over the mantelshelf I could scarcely take my eyes off the lovely face of the lady, and I thought I could have picked off the pearls from the picture with my hand. Well, to make my story shorter, a week after everything had been made ready, and I had put lavender among all the linen, and lighted a fire in both rooms, making believe to Betty, my uncle's servant-girl, that he expected some relations from London, the travellers arrived. I remember the day as if it had been yesterday. It was the middle of February, the 19th, I think, and it had been cloudy and chill. After my dinner I put on my bonnet, as I did now every day, and got ready to"], [36, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 24 go down to Uncle Roger's. I had a kind of feeling that something would happen that day, though we had so often been disappointed, and Miss Ann, who told me the papers were full of the horrors that were happening in France, and the way people were stopped and put in prison if they tried to get away to England, or any other safe country, was looking paler and thinner and graver than ever. I was just passing through the garden to the little back gate which opened out among the beeches, when I heard my name called, and look ing back saw Miss Dorothy coming after me. \"Why, Deb,\" said she, good-humoured like, \" what a gadabout you are growing ! What is to become of my ruffles that you were to finish to-day r\" \" They're done, miss,\" I said quickly ; \" I got up early, and finished them this morning.\" \"Nay, you need not have done that,\" replied she; \"but you're in a terrible hurry. I doubt you've got a sweetheart in the village.\" \" No, miss, that I haven't ! \" I said indignantly ; but I reddened so from vexation at being delayed, that she laughed the more, held up her finger, and ran off. Well, I got home at last, and when I found every thing as usual, and Uncle Roger gone out into the home pasture with his gun, I was quite disappointed, I had so fully made up my mind that I should have found the French lady arrived. I went round the two rooms and dusted them as I did every day, lit the fires, and then with a sudden"], [37, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 25 thought went into the garden and got a great bunch of snow-drops to put in the parlour. I was so rest less that I could not keep still, and I remember I scolded the servant, a raw gaping girl, for follow ing me about with her eyes instead of minding her cheese-making. I spoke too sharply maybe, but you see I was afraid of her finding anything out about the young squire. At last I was forced to set off back, but I was so reluctant to lose all hope, that I bade Betty keep the fires up in both rooms, and left her the key, thinking I could run down again after tea. It had been cold and dull before, but now it was still colder and duller. The wind had got up, and I could hear it moaning among the branches of the beech-trees, and very soon large, cold drops of rain began to fall. I had been loitering, but now I hurried on, anxious to reach the Hall before the storm fell. I had just got to the bottom of the hill, and was thinking that after all I was glad the young lady had not got her first sight of things on such a dreary day, when I heard a sound of horses and a chaise coming fast down the road towards me. There was a sharp turn just there, and I had hardly time to get out of the way when they turned the corner. I saw that the driver could not guide the horses in the least, that they were running away, and that the chaise was swaying backwards and forwards, and must be overturned in a minute. I clasped my hands, and shut my"], [38, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 26 eyes that I might not see what happened ; but I soon opened them again, for I heard a child's scream amidst the kicking of horses and the noise of the falling chaise. It had been thrown on its side against the steep bank, the horses were plung ing violently, and the coachman, who had been jerked off his box, lay in the road, half stunned, as I thought then, though I soon found out that he had had too much strong ale at his last baiting place. I ran to the window of the chaise, and there was the pale face and large, dark terrified eyes of a young lady who was trying to unfasten the door, though her hands shook so that she could not find the handle. \" I will undo it, miss,\" I cried. \" Thank you ; gently, if you please,\" said the young lady in a curiously slow, quiet tone, for the agitation she was in. \" My boy is hurt.\" I opened the door as gently as I could, and there was a boy of about nine or ten years old in a dead faint. I made a movement to reach to him and lift him out, but the lady put my arm away, and with both hers took him up herself, as if she couldn't bear that any one else should touch him. Some how, that action of hers, and her half-distrustful look when she first saw me, told me who she was. No wonder that she was jealous over her child, when he was all that was left to her now ; and no wonder either that the very sight of a stranger filled her with dread and suspicion, freshly come as she was from people who were at that time,"], [39, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 27 from what I could gather, nothing more or less than mad savages. Of course the thought darted into my mind as quick as lightning, and I didn't stop then to think why it came, for the horses were struggling so much I thought the chaise would be kicked to pieces. With some difficulty I got the lady out, with her burden in her arms, and then looked at the coachman, who began to move, and at last sate up and stared about him. \" Cut the traces ; or, if you can't, lend me a knife ! \" I cried. He got up at that, for the fall and the fright had partly sobered him, and set himself to work to free the struggling brutes, while I turned again to the child. \" Let me carry him, madam,\" I said, dropping a curtsey. \" I am very strong, and the house where you are going is only half a mile farther down the road.\" She looked at me wistfully. \" I am going to one Master Roger Standish,\" she said in very good English ; but still, in the same slow way, pronouncing every word more than an English woman would. \"He is my uncle, madam; and I have got rooms ready and aired for you this long time. I am so thankful you are come.\" She answered nothing to this ; I think she was half stupefied with grief and fright, and fatigue ; but she let me take the little boy, who was far too heavy for her to carry, and began to walk on,"], [40, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 28 while I took off my shawl, for it was now raining heavily, and wrapped it round him. I also went to the coachman, who had released the horses, and was trying in vain to lift the chaise upright with a stiff shoulder and a broken head, told him I would send up one of the farming men to help him, borrowed the cape of his great coat for the lady, and so we set off, I carrying the poor little boy, who still remained insensible. When we got to the house I saw Uncle Roger, to my great joy, in the yard, and called to him. He came, looking very much astonished at first, but when I asked him to go and see after the driver of the post chaise, and bring him down home, he understood in a moment. It was never his way to say much, and he was quite silent as he went before us into the kitchen, but then he took off his cap, and made a bow that would have become the squire himself, as he said in a low voice which trembled a little, I thought, \"You're heartily welcome, madam, for the sake of Master Herbert,\" and she gave him her hand so prettily, and tried to smile ! Then he left us, and I saw him striding along up the road where the postchaise lay. The first thing I did was to pull the patchwork cushion from Uncle Roger's chair and lay the child on it, and then to run for water and a cordial, and to tell Betty they were travellers who had met with an accident and must be lodged for the night. I was quite thankful I could explain their arrival so easily, for I had been much troubled about that"], [41, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 29 part of the plan, and loth to trust Betty, who, though a good honest girl, was terribly fond of gossiping. I bade her get hot water and make up the bed, and then hurried into the kitchen. The lady was kneeling on the floor over the child as I entered, murmuring words which I could not under stand in a soft, cooing voice, parting off the wet hair from his forehead, and holding his little hands to her lips. He was beginning to revive, and by the time I had sprinkled his face with vinegar, and got a spoonful of cordial water into his mouth, I saw the colour come faintly into his cheeks, and pre sently he opened his eyes and said, \" Mamma ! \" To my surprise, she burst into tears, and seizing hold of my hands, kissed them over and over again. Poor thing ! the trouble and fright she had under gone had quite unsettled her spirits. Before I was able to compose her, the little boy had quite recovered, and was asking where they were, and how they got there, and a host of ques tions, all in good English. \" You are safe ! Ah, my God, you are safe !\" cried his mother, throwing her arms round him with a shudder. Betty now came in to say that everything was ready, and I conducted them up-stairs. \" What a pretty house ! \" chattered the boy, as he went ; \"and are we to live here till papa comes?\" and then he suddenly went pale again, and I held out my hand for fear he should fall. He would not take it, but came close to me and said in a whisper,"], [42, "MY 0 WN PEOPLE. 30 \" I hurt my back when the carriage fell down, but papa said I was to be brave, and to comfort mamma, and so I will.\" When we got into the parlour, I thought it looked very pretty and comfortable, and I hoped the poor young lady would think so too. The logs on the hearth crackled with a pleasant, friendly sound, and the fire-light shone upon the oak panelling of the walls and the tea-things in the corner. Two deep-backed arm-chairs were drawn up on each side of the hearth ; and through the open door there was a peep at the white bed and flowered chintz curtains in the room beyond. I glanced at the lady's face, and was thoughtless enough to feel hurt because she seemed scarcely to see any of the things I have mentioned, but looked very sad and quiet. I drew one of the large chairs closer to the fire, and asked her to sit down, which she did, taking her boy on her lap, while I knelt before her and took off her wet shoes. When she had taken off her bonnet, and I could look at her more clearly, I saw that she was about twenty-six years old. She was very short and small, and her face was pale and sweet, and lighted by large and very dark eyes. Her hair was dark, and not powdered as nearly every one then wore it in England ; but drawn quite off her forehead to the back of her head, where it fell in natural curls. She was not nearly so pretty as my Miss Agatha with her golden hair and pink and white skin ; but yet there was something in her face you"], [43, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 31 could not help thinking about again and again. She had suffered very much, poor thing, and that always makes a face worth looking at ; and per haps, as I was young, it struck me more than it would now ; and yet I have heard Miss Ann say the same. Anyhow, she was quite different from most people, and had a way of saying and doing things which made you feel as if nobody else had ever said or done the same thing half so well. The boy, who was named Herbert after his father, was a pretty boy, with eyes like his mother's, and slight for his age, but not a bit like her in other ways. He had a quiet, determined look in his face, which was not like what I had ever seen in a child's before. As I set about laying out the tea-things, he sat gazing at me in a grave, steady way that made me feel actually shy, though he was such a child ; and I was quite relieved when I heard Uncle Roger and the post-boy in the kitchen, and Uncle Roger calling me. I went down-stairs to him, and found Betty giving the driver some ointment for his head, and taking occasion to chatter lo him, of course. I soon stopped her by bidding her go up-stairs with candles, and then I found that he wanted his money, and I had to run up after her to ask for it. \" I have but French money,\" said the poor lady in a tremulous voice, when she understood what I wanted. \" Herbert \u2014 my husband could not give me any English. See ! I have only this,\" hold-"], [44, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 32 ing up some small silver coins I could make no thing of. She looked so distressed, that I said, \"Never mind, madam ; my uncle will pay the man,\" and went down-stairs again. \" Plague on me for a thoughtless, blundering fellow ! \" cried Uncle Roger, when I told him of it : \"I might have thought of this.\" He soon settled the matter with the post-boy, who was sober enough now, and after seeing him drive away, he told me he was going for Miss Ann, and, calling the dogs, set off, leaving me with the travellers on my hands, feeling rather strange, but glad at heart that the poor things had got safely to England at last. I went up-stairs to lay the tea ; and the room looked more cheerful now, for I had shut out the dim, rainy light, and lighted candles. Madam was seated before the fire looking into the blaze, but I'm sure her eyes saw very far beyond it ; out and away to Paris most likely, amid fighting men and women, and pale, scared faces, and firing and blood. She never looked up as I came in ; never even noticed the absence of the little boy, who had slipped into the bedroom, and was gazing intently at my favourite picture. I went up to him and asked him how he liked it. His answer was a strange one ; or rather it was not an answer, but a question. \" How much money would she get for her pearls, I wonder ? \" I was so astonished that I only stared at him"], [45, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 33 and did not answer ; but he fixed his eyes on my face, and gravely repeated the question. \" I know nothing about pearls, sir,\" I said at last, \" and it was not likely she would want to sell them\u2014 such a grand, beautiful lady.\" \" But grand, beautiful ladies do want to sell pearls sometimes,\" persisted he. \" Mamma did, and she is a lady, and a beautiful lady too, though I don't call her grand exactly ; \" and he looked in my face as if to ask my opinion. \"She is beautiful, sir, beyond a doubt.\" \" Yes,\" said the boy thoughtfully, \" and she sold all her pearls to try and get some money, but they were not quite so large as those,\" pointing to the picture. \" She must want her tea now,\" I said, \" and so must you. I am going to get some for you, and fry some eggs.\" \"Mamma doesn't like tea; she only drinks coffee. Papa wants her to like it, but she doesn't, though sometimes she pretends, you know.\" As he said this, a wonderfully arch smile broke like a sunbeam over the little grave face, and gave me a sudden sense of relief from oppression. \" Oh, I have coffee for her,\" I said gaily. \" Miss Ann told me of that.\" \" Who is Miss Ann ? Is she Aunt Ann r\" \"Yes, sir; she will come and see your mamma, I hope, very soon ; and you will love her, I know. Will you come into the parlour ? \" \" Yes,\" he said wearily, and all trace of the D"], [46, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 34 sudden, childlike smile was gone ; \" but I don't want any coffee. I would rather go to bed.\" \"You shall then, sir. Directly, if you like.\" \" No,\" he said ; \" I forgot. I will come. Made moiselle,\" and he seized hold of my gown in his earnestness, \" don't say that I am tired ! I shall sit up till mamma goes to bed. Papa always did. She is frightened sometimes now, when she is alone ; and she weeps \u2014 oh, so much ! \" and the boy held up his little hands. \" But I will stay with her ; she shan't be alone. There is nothing to fear here. You had better go to bed if you are tired.\" \"I am tired,\" said the little fellow, rather piteously. \" But no, I won't go to bed,\" and he staggered the same minute and fell against me. Poor little man ! he was tired indeed ; nay, I was sorely afraid it was something more, for I remem bered how he had talked of his back hurting him as he came up-stairs, and my mind misgave me. I shut the door into the next room, and laid him on the bed. He soon came to himself, but did not seem to know where he was, and said something to me in what I took to be French, for I could not understand it. He let me undress him and put him to bed ; and when I told him that his mother would come and sleep with him, he seemed to understand, and lay quite still. I was not comfortable about him, but I thought I would wait for Uncle Roger before doing"], [47, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 35 anything more, so I went back into the parlour, and there was the poor lady still sitting where I had left her. I thought if I spoke to her it would rouse her, so I said, \" I will bring coffee in a few minutes, madam. Uncle Roger has gone up to the house for Miss Ann.\" \" Ann ! \" she repeated. \" Do you think she will come to me ? Will they let her ? \" \" Oh yes, madam, I am quite sure she will come ; but you will be better when you have had some thing. I will get the supper.\" Now, in spite of my anxiety about Master Herbert, and my pity for the poor lady, and my strange feelings altogether, I remember I was more intent upon that supper than I can say. The one thought that was uppermost with me as I went down to see about it was, that I was very glad Betty had baked that morning. To be sure what trifles come into our minds, and dwell there too, when we are, maybe, anxious and dis tressed about graver matters. Alas for my supper ! It was hardly touched. I had taken it away, and was carefully putting aside some coffee and eatables, in case the little boy awoke, when I heard Rover's bark, and knew that Uncle Roger was coming, and Miss Ann, I hoped, with him. I ran to the door, but it was raining now so heavily that I could see nothing but the glimmer of Uncle Roger's lantern, still some distance off. I had nearly shut the door again, when Rover rushed through the opening,"], [48, "36 MY OWN PEOPLE. and almost threw me down, and then pushed his great wet nose into my hand by way of apology before he went to his mat in the chimney corner. When I saw how wet he was, and heard the rain splashing on the tiles of the porch, I almost hoped Miss Ann would not come ; but Uncle Roger hallooed, I opened the door once more, and there she was. I drew her to the fire, and began to take off her wet things, but she did not seem to notice them ; she only kept repeating, \" Where is she r where is she?\" in an agitated way, and would hardly let me do what was necessary. I took her up-stairs and opened the parlour door ; I saw madam start up and hold out her hands ; I heard Miss Ann say as she went forward, \" My sister ! \" and then I shut the door, and went down-stairs, my eyes misty with tears. There followed as anxious and dreary a month as I ever remember to have experienced in my life. The anxiety came from the illness of poor little Master Herbert, and the dreariness from the pale, woe-begone face of his mother, from the rain which fell incessantly, and from the necessity there was that Miss Ann should come but seldom, and then in fear, lest her motives for coming should be dis covered. I had leave to go to and fro when it was needful, and as often as not, I slept at the Farm. It was a strange state of things, and as sad as it was strange. There was the squire, as kind-"], [49, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 37 hearted a gentleman in the main as could be in England \u2014 I would never have you, his great grand daughters, think otherwise \u2014 and yet he was living close to the house where his only son's wife was tending her sick child, his grandson, and he knew nothing of it, and no one dared to tell him ! There too were the young ladies, good, amiable, and true hearted ; yet the younger ones barely knew that they had a brother, much less that he was in danger, and that his child was well-nigh dying in the very room from which their sister had so lately been carried to her grave. I was constantly occupied in nursing Master Herbert, and, of course, my absence had to be accounted for, which was easily done. No one need know that the travellers who had been over turned so close to my uncle's were anything more than strangers in name as well as in deed. The lady was known to be French, and she went by the name of \"Madame,\" both in the household and out of it. So far there was no difficulty, but presently the squire heard of the accident. Miss Ann told him purposely to prepare him for the truth, and he rode down to inquire after the travellers. I told him, in answer to his questions, that the lady was too much engaged with her sick child to see any one, and he sent up his respects to her, and rode away. By-and-by down comes one of the servants from the Hall with a great basket of things \u2014 wines, cordials, jellies, and what not \u2014 all for the lady and the little boy ; and she, when she"], [50, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 38 knew where they came from, refused to touch so much as one glass of wine herself, though she was thankful for them for the child, who could not eat a quarter of the things that came daily by the squire's orders. It may have been pride \u2014 I suppose it was \u2014 but I could never bring myself to say that I thought it wrong. It was her son's right, she said to Miss Ann one day before me, but for herself she would rather die than take so much as a crumb of bread from the squire under false pretences. The doctor from the nearest town came, and said that Master Herbert's spine had been injured by the fall from the carriage, but spoke hopefully of his getting well in time. Ah, that time seemed to grow longer and longer ! He was very patient and good. He would lie for hours with his grave eyes fixed upon the picture of the lady I have before told you of. It seemed to have taken his fancy mightily. Once he told me that he had had a dream about it, and that the lady walked out of the picture-frame, and hold ing out her pearl necklace, offered him a wish for every pearl. He began by wishing that his papa might come home, but the lady frowned as she said that could not be, he would never see his papa again ; and, withdrawing her pearls, disappeared. I smiled, and told him that dreams meant nothing mostly ; but I could see that this one had taken hold of his mind. \" Don't tell mamma,\" he said anxiously, \" she would cry. But, mademoiselle, if I should never"], [51, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 39 get well again, what would become of her if papa does not come back ? \" To which question I could answer nothing. What would become of her indeed ! A month passed. The rain ceased at last, the sun shone, and everything blossomed out into beauty and brightness. But the weather did not appear to have any cheering effect upon poor madame. The only difference it made to her was that \u2014 whereas while it rained she had got a habit of going to the window whenever her boy slept, and she could resolve to leave his bedside, and gazing up the road sometimes for more than an hour at a time without moving \u2014 she would now go out of doors at such times, into the garden, and leaning on the gate, would stand, her face turned in the same direction, always looking \u2014 looking. She had never been seen at such times, as it happened, by any of the Hall family ; and very thankful I was, for I had often been greatly troubled in my mind as to what I should say if they were to come and ask me downright questions. So time went on, and summer had fully come. One day \u2014 a balmy day towards the end of June \u2014 Master Herbert was better, and I had lifted him, by the doctor's orders, to the sofa in the parlour. He was tired with the exertion, and fell into a doze, holding his mother's hand, but soon woke up, calling, \" Papa ! \" Poor lady ! the little word upset her by its suddenness. She bowed her head over him and sobbed pitifully. I was glad"], [52, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 40 to see her weep, for I was sure it was a more natural and healthy vent to her sorrows than tear less despondency. I knew her boy would comfort her better than I could, so I stole softly out of the room, and going into the kitchen, busied myself with sundry things which I could not trust to Betty. By-and-by madame came down, and ask ing me in her pretty, hesitating way to stay by Master Herbert, passed out into the garden. I watched her for a few minutes before I went up-stairs. She had tied a white lace handker chief over her head, cornerwise, her usually pale cheeks were faintly coloured from her emotion, and the tears she had shed had set blue rims round her eyes, and made them look dreamy and spiritual. She looked too fragile to bear any great grief, and I put up a prayer, as I stood watching her, that she might not be overmuch tried. When I got up-stairs, Master Herbert was asleep again ; so I took my work, and sat down near the open window. I could see the poor lady leaning over the gate as usual ; but I was presently startled by the sight of Miss Dorothy, who walked very fast down the hill, and, stopping when she saw madame, began to talk eagerly to her. I watched anxiously, you may be sure. After a few minutes' conversation, Miss Dorothy put out her hand, un latched the gate, and came towards the house. \" Do let me see him ! \" I heard her say ; \" I am so fond of children.\" She was always a wilful young lady, and I could see she did not intend to"], [53, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 41 be thwarted now ; but I did not want her to wake Master Herbert for all that, so I went down-stairs to prevent her from coming up. What was Miss Dorothy like ? I will tell you. Though she was the youngest of the four remaining sisters, she had more than her full share of the family beauty and stature, and was, moreover, very winning, with a merry, wilful way no one ever thought of resisting, least of all the squire, whose favourite she was. As she stood by the French lady at the kitchen-door, in her fresh chintz muslin gown, with her beautiful brown hair tied behind low in the neck with a blue riband, and her complexion heightened by the sun and her own eagerness, there was as much difference between them as there is between a glowing rose-bud and a drooping lily-bell. She was only nineteen years old, and madame was twenty-seven ; but it was not years that had made all that difference between them. \" Deb,\" said Miss Dorothy, on seeing me, \" I have come to pay a visit to this lady, and to see her poor little boy ; she says I may. I don't know why Ann should have them all to herself.\" As she said this, she looked at me in an arch, knowing way that took me quite aback. Had she discovered Miss Ann's secret visits ? And, if so, did she know or suspect the truth ? I said nothing, but only curtsied, and, looking at madame, said, \" The young gentleman is asleep.\" \" Then I will wait till he wakes, I have brought"], [54, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 42 him some flowers,\" replied Miss Dorothy, holding up a bunch, \" though after all, I don't know but that your gillyflowers and stocks are quite as pretty, and much sweeter than my pansies.\" \" Ah, how kind you are ! \" said madame, who was uneasy, I could see. \"I will take them up stairs, and go and watch till he wakes ; \" so saying she went away up-stairs, and Miss Dorothy sat herself down in the kitchen to wait. \" How lovely she is, Deb ! \" were her first words, which surprised me, as I thought Miss Dorothy herself much the more comely of the two ; \" have you not lost your heart to her ?\" \" I hope not, miss,\" I replied, \" I suppose it would be a sin to do that to a Papist.\" \" Well, I don't know,\" was her answer, \" if it is a sin, I have committed it. Is the child like her ? \" \"No, miss,\" I said; and then my foolish tongue blurted out \u2014 \" Uncle Roger says he's more like his father.\" I felt crazy when the words were out, and could have beaten myself, but it was too late. \"His father! Uncle Roger!\" repeated Miss Dorothy, getting up from her chair, \" who is he ? What does Uncle Roger know r What can you mean ? \" I was dumb. As she stood there, I, self-con victed, looking at her, could tell the very moment when the truth flashed into her mind. At first she was utterly puzzled ; then I saw a flush creep"], [55, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 43 into her face ; gradually it grew hotter and deeper, and her eyes flashed at me almost fiercely. \"I know \u2014 I see it all,\" she broke out, \"and Ann knows it ; how cruel she has been ! \" \" No, not Miss Ann,\" I said, afraid of uttering a word more, lest I should do further mischief, and still ignorant of how much she had really guessed ; \" not Miss Ann ! \" \" To think,\" she went on, not heeding me, but looking piteously at the door where madame had disappeared ; \" to think of our being so near, and so well and happy, while my brother's wife and child are ill and miserable ! for I know I have a brother, Deb, though I never saw him that I can remember, and no one dares talk of him now. Where is he ? \" I was forced to answer now. \" In Paris, miss, I am afraid.\" She gave a cry, \" Paris ! Oh, my God ! and she has left him there ? \" \" She was obliged to come ; her life was not safe, nor Master Herbert's.\" \" Herbert, Herbert,\" she murmured ; \" yes, that is his name. Ah, Deborah ! how sad and strange that I have never called him by it ! \" She started up again impetuously, \"Let me go and see them. What am I waiting here for, when I have a sister up-stairs ? \" But I stood between her and the door. \" Miss Dorothy,\" I said, \" I have done mischief already by my over-hasty tongue, and you will do more, unless you will be patient, and let me tell"], [56, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 44 Miss Ann before you go up. Think how much depends on how the squire takes it when he knows ; and Betty is about, and might get scent of the matter if you were to go up now, and then the village tongues would be all wagging. Oh, miss, do be ruled by me ! \" Miss Dorothy was moved by my anxiety. \" I will go to my father at once,\" she said in quite a stately way ; \" it is not fitting he should be kept in ignorance of this. I wonder at Roger, and at Ann too. I am not afraid that my father will do any thing but what is right and proper. I shall go this instant.\" She tied on her hat, and though she had much ado not to cry outright, walked out of the house with the air and step of a queen. I had not thought it in her. When she was gone, I sat down to consider ; and, though I was rueful at the thought of having \"tattled,\" as Uncle Roger would say, I, who had been something over-boastful of being trusted, I could not but think Miss Dorothy was right and that the squire ought to know the truth. Miss Ann was more of the timid sort than her sisters, and had perhaps misjudged matters in keeping them so secret. One thing was certain, I must confess to her ; and as soon as the milk ing was done, and the milk-pans set, and I had taken supper up-stairs and put Master Herbert back to bed, I set out to walk to the Hall, and tell my tale. I felt very much humbled. The last time I had walked that road, my foolish"], [57, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 45 heart had been all swelling with pride at having such a secret to keep ; and, if any one had told me I should betray it, I should have flouted the notion. Now, I could hardly help crying, as I tried to imagine what Miss Ann's looks would be when she heard of my thoughtlessness. I was so intent on my own bitter reflections, that I saw and heard nothing, till I was brought to a standstill by the sound of Miss Ann's voice close to me. \" Why, Deb,\" she said, \" a penny for your thoughts ! You were all but going into the hedge a moment ago, and now you were very nearly knocking me down.\" I gave a violent start, and felt the blood rush to my face. \" Nay, Deborah, there is something the matter,\" said Miss Ann, changing her tone ; \" what is it ? Nothing wrong at the Farm, I hope ! Speak, girl ! \" \" No, nothing wrong in the way you mean, miss; only that I have been a fool,\" I said. \"Is that all?\" said Miss Ann, with a smile of relief ; \" you frightened me, Deb.\" \" Oh, don't smile at me ! I don't deserve it ! \" I cried ; and then I told her all. She heaved a long sigh after I had done speak ing, and said, half to herself, \" I was trying to prepare him only yesterday, and the bare name \u2014 \" Then she broke off, and, turning to me, went on without a spark of anger\u2014 \" There's no denying that you have been thoughtless, Deborah ; but I can't blame you, for you are sorry enough, I see."], [58, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 46 God knows the wretched secret has pressed upon me more heavily than I could bear at times ; and perhaps it is as well it should be shared. Dorothy is, maybe, right.\" She fell into thought for a few moments, and then resumed : \" Therefore don't look so wretched, Deborah ; I forgive you, heartily. Now your confession is ended, come back with me, for I was coming to see my sister and little Her bert.\" Ah, how lovingly she lingered on that name, which she had been debarred from uttering, except in her prayers, for so long ! Her kindness made me feel doubly sorry for what I had done, and so did her hasty steps, and the flush on her usually pale cheeks ; for I knew they betokened nervous excitement which she often suffered from now, and which was telling on her health. She remained longer than usual up-stairs, and when she came down it was growing dusk, and Uncle Roger had come home and was taking his pipe in the garden. I offered to walk back with her, but she refused ; and then, as if fearing how I might interpret her refusal, she turned back at the door and took my hand. \" God bless you, Deborah,\" she said ; \" you are a faithful girl ; don't be down-hearted. There is One above who orders all things ;\" and so she left me, much comforted, and feeling as if I could have kissed the hem of her gown. I could not rest, however, until I had told Uncle Roger ; so I went out to him among the flower -borders. He was smoking, and did not seem in a humour to talk ; so I went and put my"], [59, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 47 arm in his silently. We took three turns up and down along the turf walk bordered with thrift, before he spoke a word, and I had not found courage to begin, when he stopped opposite the great mulberry-tree which stood by itself at the end of the path, and said, \"How Master Herbert loved mulberries ! Deb, I've been thinking and thinking, and I can't stand it any longer ; I must have it out with the squire ! \" \" Have what out, uncle ? \" I asked. \"Why,\" said my uncle, slowly beginning to refill his pipe, \" I must tell him about them,\" and he jerked his hand towards the parlour-window. \" Miss Ann is for waiting a bit longer, and of course I should do nothing without her; but women are mostly for waiting,\" said Uncle Roger, who, though he thought a great deal of the Hall young ladies, had very little opinion of the judgment of any created woman. \" I don't know what you will say to me then,\" I said, boldly now it came to the point, \" for I let it out to Miss Dorothy this afternoon, or at least she guessed it from a stray word of mine, and she was all for telling the squire that minute. I doubt she has done it before now.\" \"God be thanked!\" ejaculated Uncle Roger, and took a fourth turn without saying another word. I was vastly relieved \" Then you are not angry with me, uncle ? I feared you would be.\""], [60, "48 MY OWN PEOPLE. \" You, Deb ? I had forgotten you. No. I always said no woman could keep a secret for long ; but the women can't help it, I suppose ;\" and with that Uncle Roger walked into the kitchen to finish his pipe, and I remained in the garden for a few minutes before going to get him his night's draught of ale, thinking ; and my thoughts were dreary. It was a fair evening, and the sun had gone down in a flush of purple and amber and violet. The trees round were whispering with that faint, hush ing sound which, when I was a girl, always made me fancy foolishly that they had a hidden, con scious life which woke up at twilight. This fancy was augmented, perhaps, by the ghostly gloom they shed around them, making the flowers pale by contrast, and the tall, white lilies look like a pro cession of veiled nuns. The silence was so com plete, but for this subdued tree murmur, that the sudden sound of the house-dog dragging his chain, as he turned in the kennel, startled me exceedingly. The fact is, I had been giving way to doubting and faithless thoughts, and that makes people super stitious. \"All is going wrong,\" I had said to myself, when in fact I ought to have said, \" All will be sure to go right.\" I had looked at the trees, and imagined that the shadow they cast upon the ground at my feet was not darker than the shadow which lay over the fortunes of the young squire, his wife, and son ; but I forgot that when the sun was high in the heavens again, the tree shadows would no longer be there, and I forgot too"], [61, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 49 that there was a Hand holding the thread which seemed in such a tangle, and would one day reduce it to perfect order \u2014 if not in this world, why then in the next. The sudden noise of the chain broke the train of my ideas, and looking up, I saw one or two stars shining faintly in the summer sky. They carried my thoughts beyond the earth. I do not quite know how it was, but when I went into the house it was with a deep sense of inner peace in the assurance that He who watched over Israel was watching over both Hall and Farm, and that He never slumbered nor slept. The next morning little Herbert was very ill. He lay like a broken flower, too drowsy to lift his head from the pillow, and with such a wander ing look in his eyes that we sent for the doctor in terrified haste. When he came and had looked at the patient, he smiled at the poor, pale mother, but shook his head when he met my eye. \" The hurt in the spine has gone to the brain,\" he said, when I followed him down-stairs. \"I ex pected it ; he will never speak again. Can you bear to tell his mother r \" \" Oh no, no!\" I said, bursting into tears. \" Who is to do it ? \" he said, a little huskily. I shook my head. What a new, dreadful trouble this was ! \" The squire \" began the doctor, but I had found words now. E"], [62, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 50 \" How long will it be ? the end, I mean,\" I asked. \" He may go off suddenly in convulsions, or he may linger on for some weeks. I cannot tell.\" \" Which is most likely ? \" \" The first. I will look in again, if I can, this evening when I come from Sheep's Farm. God help us, there is trouble enough in the world. The poor woman there will die, and there are eight children.\" I heard the words, but hardly heeded them, though at any other time they would have given me pain enough. I threw the hood of my cloak over my head, and as the doctor rode off, made the best of my way up to the Hall to see Miss Ann. She was not at home, nor the squire, nor Miss Dorothy, and I set off home again half dis traught. As I hurried down the hill, just at the turn of the road where I had first seen madame, I met a young man walking up it. His face was eager and haggard, and his dress had something peculiar and out of date about it ; but my mind was so pre-occupied that I should not have noticed him much if he had not addressed me. \" My good girl,\" he said, \" can you tell me if Squire Stirling is at home ? \" He spoke hurriedly, as if he were out of breath, and yet he was walking quite slowly. I told him no ; and, even in my hurry, I noticed a wistful look in his eyes, and a movement of his lips, as if he were anxious to say something more, which made me hesitate to pass on and leave him ;"], [63, ""], [64, ""], [65, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 51 and at last I said, \" Do you know the way to the Hall, sir ? \" He smiled a little. \" I think I do,\" he said. \" Is there any one at home ? \u2014 one of the young ladies, for instance ? \" I did not quite like this question from a stranger ; so I answered shortly that I did not know, that I must make haste back to the Farm, where I was wanted to attend upon a lady and a dying child. He grew suddenly pale, and then \u2014 I knew him ! I had been blind not to recog nise the keen blue eye of the Stirling family, and the firm, sweet mouth I had so often admired in the little dying child at home. \" Dying ! \" was the only word he uttered, as he recovered himself, and began to stride down the hill by my side. \" I am afraid so, sir : and oh, thank heaven, you are come ! \" He said nothing till we came in sight of the Farm, and then he began \u2014 \" Why are they not at home ? My father- But I hurried him in at the gate. It was no time to tell him that the squire had never known, till the day before, of their being so near him. We were in the kitchen. \" Shall I go up and prepare her ? \" I whispered. But he passed me impetuously, and went up stairs \u2014 I following. When we got into the room, a strange and most unexpected sight met my eyes. The squire sat on one side of the bed, where lay the poor innocent, pressing both his hands over his face, and crying"], [66, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 52 like a child ; madame, perfectly pale and quiet, was kneeling on the other side, and Miss Ann and Miss Dorothy were standing near, the one silent, the other sobbing violently. As we entered, the child was seized with a con vulsion. Miss Ann it was who applied remedies, which were too late to be of any use, and who held the little fellow's hands as they struggled uncon sciously on the pillow. His mother, still pale and quiet, never took her eyes off the child, till as her husband pressed forward and leaned over the bed with a face of such agony as I have hardly ever seen, they closed, and she sank back in a fainting fit upon the floor. I was thankful, for it was a relief to feel that something could be done. It was so dreadful to stand helplessly by, and watch the suffering one could do nothing to relieve. You will know one day, my dears, that the hardest part of our lives, and the part that tries our faith in God the most, is when we have to stand and look on only, when we would fain be doing \u2014 at least, it has been so with me. I got madame out of the room to the sofa in the parlour, and when I went back again to fetch a cordial, the young squire had lifted the child in his arms, and the little face, quiet now, was lying on his breast. Miss Ann had one arm thrown round her brother, and her face was buried in his shoulder, while Miss Dorothy had stolen round to her father ; but the old squire still sat, his face in his hands, crying like a child."], [67, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 53 Master Herbert lingered two days longer, and then died. Poor lamb ! He had talked so much about being a comfort to his mother ; but when the end came we could hardly tell whether he knew her, as he opened his drowsy eyes for a moment at her kisses and whisper of his name, and then shut them for ever. Young Mr. Herbert was nearly frantic at his loss, but I think none took it so sorely or so deeply to heart as the old squire, whose one thought seemed to be how he could make up to the mother for his former anger against her. She refused to move from the Farm until her boy was buried, but then she made no objection to anything, only beg ging that I might continue to wait on her. After the funeral, the squire himself came down to the Farm in a coach to take her home. Uncle Roger attended her to the coach door, and came back to the kitchen with a tear in his eye. \" There's no one like the squire ! \" he said tri umphantly, and trying to wink the tear away, lest I should see it \u2014 good, tender-hearted Uncle Roger! \u2014 \"he was begging her pardon as if she had been a princess ; all broken down and humble.\" \" And she ? \" I asked. \"She looked sorrowfully at him with those eyes of hers till / could hardly bear it, and then she tried to smile, ay, and managed it too ; and took his hands and kissed them. They have made a fool of me between 'em,\" added my uncle"], [68, "MY 0 WN PEOPLE. 54 angrily, starting up and blowing his nose vigo rously ; \" but I knew Master Herbert would never marry any one that wasn't half an angel,\" and he went off to the yard, while I went up-stairs and busied myself, with a strange mixture of pain and pleasure, in setting things straight in the deserted rooms, and preparing for my return to the Hall the next day. You will think all my stories very sad ones, my dears, for there is a sad ending to this one. At first poor madame brightened under the tender affection and care lavished upon her by her sisters, and, above all, by the constant presence of her husband. Miss Dorothy even succeeded in making her smile occasionally, and we all hoped that her sorrow was gradually healing, and that what she had undergone would pass by degrees out of her mind. One morning I was helping her to dress ; she had grown very silent, so I was sur prised when she began to talk to me. At first it was only some question which made me suppose she was not thinking of what she was saying, for she spoke as if she were still at the Farm, but the next words alarmed me. \" Oh, Deborah ! \" she said, with one of the deep, weary sighs I used to hear so often, and which I had so joyfully missed of late ; \" Oh, Deborah ! do you think he will ever come back ? \" \"Who, madame?\" \" My husband.\" Then clasping her hands over her face, with a strong shudder, she exclaimed,"], [69, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 55 \" My God ! those sights and sounds will never leave me ! Herbert ! Herbert ! \" She uttered these last words in a piercing scream, and her husband rushed into the room, and taking her in his arms, tried to soothe her ; but it was many minutes before she even knew him, and when she did, her agitation was difficult to subdue, and it was not until she was worn out that she sank to sleep, holding his hand. These seizures recurred often, and each time they left her more wearied and exhausted, both in mind and body. Her face grew thin and sharp, her eyes larger and more lustrous ; it was plain to me that she was dying, long before any of the family dared ask one another the question. When they did, the best doctor in London was sent for, but he could only say that she must be kept quiet and amused, and that when she was a little stronger, which he hoped to make her by his medicines, she must go away somewhere for entire change of scene. Well, for a time she did get stronger, and I went with her and her husband and Miss Ann to a quiet little place on the sea-coast, not very far from the Hall, on the other side of the Chalk Downs. It was my first sight of the sea, and it impressed me wonderfully. It made me think of what the Bible says about God holding the waters in the hollow of his hand ; and there was a world of quiet in the thought to my restlessly active nature. When I saw the waves leaping and flash-"], [70, "56 MY OWN PEOPLE. ing in the strong breeze, I could better understand God's power ; and when they were at rest, I could the more easily comprehend his mercy. I grew to love the sea with all my heart. Madame shared my feeling, and became visibly more tranquil, though weaker instead of stronger, in spite of the doctor's medicines. I need not dwell upon this melancholy time. It was November \u2014 quiet, drowsy, colourless No vember \u2014 when, one evening, she fell asleep like a tired child in her husband's arms, and slept away her life without so much as a sigh. I know but little of creeds and religions, and, as a girl, I was taught to believe that the Papists were all wicked, and not one of them could be saved hereafter. I cannot think so now I am old. I did not in my heart think so then, nor, I believe, did one of those who stood sadly over the open vault, at the poor French lady's funeral. Experience makes us large-hearted as well as years. If patience, meekness, and forgiveness of injuries and unkindnesses are \"blessed,\" the young squire's wife will meet and welcome her husband in heaven."], [71, "III. /^VNE evening, a few weeks after Nurse had told X^ us the sad story of little Herbert and his mother, she brought down a small morocco case, and, opening it, showed us a somewhat faded portrait of a lady. The face was a smiling one, that looked as if care had never come near it ; the eyes were large and blue ; the curls sunny ; the forehead high and white, and the mouth dimpled. At the back were twisted two locks of hair, the one light brown, and the other black. \" You will perhaps have heard, my dears,\" she said, as we admired it, \" that Mr. Herbert married again, and that your dear mother was his eldest child ; \" and, in answer to our questions, she told us the following particulars about our grandmother, whose name was difficult to associate with that fresh and youthful portrait. It was in the year 1802, when peace was pro claimed for a short time between England and France, that Mr. Herbert started off immediately for the latter country to acquaint poor madame's only relation, an uncle, of her death, and to wind up his affairs with the mercantile house there to"], [72, "58 MY OWN PEOPLE. which he had belonged since his marriage, and which had been another cause of the squire's anger against him. He had given in to the squire's wishes that he should now come and live at home ; for you must know that sorrow had quite reconciled the father and son. His business kept him in France all the summer, but he was expected to return in autumn. I had forgotten to tell you that Miss Charlotte had been away on a visit when the sad events I have nar rated happened. She had gone up to London, a three days' journey from the Hall in those days, to visit her aunt, old Lady Ridgeway, \u2014 a great event then ; and Miss Charlotte remained with her aunt through all the succeeding winter and spring, only returning home in June, and bringing with her an orphan cousin, a daughter of the squire's brother, who had been brought up by her aunt from ear liest childhood. She was so pretty and high-spirited that every one loved her, and made much of her, but she attached herself most of all to Miss Ann. I think she felt attracted, as young bright things will, to a graver nature than her own, and one that had suffered. She found out that instinctively, I could see. Many a time I privately wished that Mr. Herbert had not gone away to France just then, but had been within reach of her blithe, beautiful face and silver tongue. September came and passed, leaving the woods ruddy. It had been a bright, pleasant season to"], [73, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 59 the young ladies, who had spent it chiefly out of doors, making long excursions in the neighbour hood, and in picnics and summer gaieties of all kinds. No Mr. Herbert, but letters to say that he was detained, but hoped to be at home in the following month. October came and went, and the hills were getting brown, and the trees here and there russet, and here and there pale gold ; Mr. Herbert neither came nor wrote, and Lady Ridgeway sent word that Miss Letitia, or Lettice as she was usually called, must be coming home. There was much talk of who should accompany her, and, at last, I was selected to be her waiting-maid up to town, and Uncle Roger was to go with us. I can hardly tell whether I was most pleased or frightened at the idea of a journey to London, but I think, on the whole, pleasure got the upper hand. You would laugh to know how my mind ran on it for days beforehand, and how my fellow-servants envied me, except Honor, the dairy-maid, who said she never expected to see me back alive, and she would not go, no, not if she were paid for it ; while Betty cried and made such a fuss that I was obliged to scold her well, though all the time I felt drawn to her for her honest affection to me. Well, the morning came, the 22nd day of No vember, and Miss Lettice, with tears in her eyes, took leave of her uncle and cousins, and got into the carriage which was to take her to the town of"], [74, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 60 , from whence the coach started. There was a raw coldness in the air which betokened a fall of some kind, and which we felt the more because of the preceding mild weather ; but we were com fortable enough, Miss Letitia and I being the only passengers inside the coach, while Uncle Roger sat outside, and whenever the coach stopped came to the window to see how we were faring. On one of these occasions he said that the coachman knew the driver of the post-chaise who had brought madame and her little boy to our house, and he, the driver, had made up a fine story about his own wounds, and his own courage, forsooth ! on the occasion. \" I have put that to rights,\" added Uncle Roger, laughing, as he went away to remount. This set Miss Letitia talking, and she would have me go through all the sad story to her, though she had heard most of it before from her cousins. The coach stopped, and we alighted for the night before I had finished, and I told her the end in the inn parlour, while we were waiting for supper. She cried heartily while I was speaking, and then sat looking thoughtfully into the fire. \" What is my cousin Herbert like ? \" she asked at length. \" As much like the squire in the face as a young man can be,\" answered I. \" Yes, yes, I know that ! \" she said rather impatiently ; \" but what is he like in other respects ? \""], [75, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 61 \" I have never seen him otherwise than very quiet and sad, miss,\" I replied. \"There, again!\" she exclaimed; \"I know he must be sad, of course. But was he patient and kind to his wife ? Did he nurse her tenderly when she was so ill, he who had taken her away from her country and friends, and given her none in their place ? If he did not, if he failed one hair's breadth in patience with her, and devotion to her, he must be a bad, selfish man ! \" She spoke with great vehemence, and the colour rose all over her lovely face. \" I don't think he did fail in any of these things,\" I said a little indignantly. \" No Stirling ever would fail in them to my belief.\" \" You think not ? \" she answered ; \" but it seems to me that my cousin, in the first place, did a very selfish thing in marrying a girl whom he knew his father would never receive. What business had he to put her in such a painful position ? it was both selfish and cruel ! \" \"If it was, miss, which I won't allow, he has suffered dearly for it,\" I said, a little hotly. \" I am glad of it ! It is mostly only women who suffer. I am glad he has had his share, and I am very glad he did not come home while I was at the Hall. I think \u2014 I am sure I should dislike him.\" 1 was too angry to reply. I could not conceive how she could have got such a mistaken fancy into her head, and felt almost guilty in having listened to such words against one of the family I"], [76, "MY OWN' PEOPLE. 62 served; so I was relieved when the supper appeared, though I could hardly get out the words, \"Here is supper, Miss Letitia; you must be hungry.\" She was inclined to be a little pettish with me when I said this. \"I am not hungry, Deborah; you have made me too sad with your story to eat ; \" but as she looked up at me I suppose she read something of what I felt in my face, for she rose and came to the table, saying, \" Don't let us quarrel, Deborah ; I believe I am cross to-night, go and get your own supper and leave me to my dumps,\" and her sweet smile melted my anger at once. The next morning I was dismayed, on looking from the window, to see snow falling gently, but decidedly. The inn was not a pleasant place to be snowed up in. Uncle Roger laughed, however, when I asked him if a coach would go on that day, and said no one ever heard of much snow in November, and so we set off on our second day's journey. Uncle Roger was apparently right. The snow ceased, the sky cleared, and we reached our second night's resting-place in comfort. But during the night the barometer fell suddenly, and when we started the next day for our last journey of thirty-five miles, the sky was leaden, and the air so cold that I felt sure we should have more snow before reaching London. We got along pretty comfortably for the first"], [77, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 63 stage, which brought us to a small town where we were to bait. Here two ladies got in, also bound for London, as we found out by their talk. The snow now began to come steadily down, but neither horses nor coachman seemed to mind it much, and we set off again about noon. Miss Letitia seemed to have quite recovered her little fit of anger, or whatever it was, and was in high spirits. She began to tell me of her childhood, and the curious, lonely bringing-up she had had in the old house at Chelsea, with gardens sloping down to the Thames ; of the pleasant boating up to Kew and Richmond ; of the drives in the parks, and of her aunt, Lady Ridgeway, who she said was just the very dearest old lady in the whole world. I began to think London must be a nice place after all, and was glad that Uncle Roger was to stay there a week on some business of the squire's, and that I was to be at my Lady Ridge way's all the time. How little I thought that many weeks, nay months, would elapse before I saw home again ! An hour passed pleasantly away in listening to Miss Letitia's lively talk, and I had almost forgotten that we were in a coach and getting near London, when I was recalled to it by feeling a shock which tumbled the basket I had on my lap into Miss Letitia's, and then the coach suddenly stopped. I let down the glass and put my head out of the window to ask what had happened, and I was told that one of the leaders had fallen, and"], [78, "64 MY OWN PEOPLE. that the snow had so increased that our progress was becoming difficult, and might soon become dangerous. This was not pleasant news, and I suppose my face expressed some dismay, for Miss Letitia laughed outright when she looked at me. \" I never had an adventure in my life,\" she said gaily, \" and I shall quite enjoy this one. Let us get out and see what they are doing to the poor horse.\" This, however, was easier said than done. The snow was by this time nearly two inches thick, and, to make it worse, the wind was beginning to rise, and to drift it in great lumps under the hedges, and in every corner where it could rest. Even since we had stopped the wheels had become clogged, and Uncle Roger begged us not to stir from our seats. After a delay of about half an hour, which was so tedious that Miss Letitia had already half changed her mind about the enjoy ment of an adventure in the snow, we moved on at a foot's pace ; the coachman being anxious, if possible, to reach London before dark. We had been going along a good, broad road, with hedge rows on either side ; now we came out upon a wide piece of heath, and were fully exposed to the wind, which began to blow furiously, driving the snow before it till the whole air looked like one vast grey cloud, through which nothing could be distinguished. On we struggled, hoping to reach the partial shelter of some trees which the coachman affirmed"], [79, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 65 were very near. But no such good fortune awaited us. It was growing dusk, although it was not much past two o'clock, and the road being quite undistinguishable, we presently found our selves upon the rough heath, in great peril of being overturned. The frightened horses could hardly be brought to stand quietly while the coachman dismounted, and proposed that some one should set off for a village, three miles dis tant, and bring help in the shape of men and fresh horses. Away started Uncle Roger accord ingly, his figure almost immediately becoming invisible to our eager eyes amid the grey pall and gathering darkness. And so here we were left on a heath, in a country of which we knew nothing, with perfect strangers, in the middle of a snow-storm ! Almost enough of an adventure to satisfy even Miss Letitia ; but there were plenty more to come that night, and in the meantime our attention was fully taken up by our two fellow-travellers, one of whom excited our amusement and the other our pity. I set the former down for a rich maiden lady, for she tra velled with a parrot in a gilt cage, and a lap-dog with a blue riband round its neck ; and the young gentlewoman with her was evidently her com panion, of whom she took considerably less care than she did of her pets. She was in a nervous fidget now, which no assurances of ours, nor offers of assistance on the part of the young lady, could allay. Indeed, she F"], [80, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 66 seemed to consider her to have in some way occasioned the snow-storm and all the succeeding disasters. \" I always knew you had a cold heart, Sophia,\" she began querulously, \" but I did not think you were quite so selfish as to sit looking indifferent and undisturbed when we are all in such a dread ful plight, and I am so frightened. But people with no nerves have very little feeling, I suppose.\" Poor Sophia had for the last ten minutes been doing her best to quiet the lap-dog, who showed a disposition to bark at the snow-flakes as they fell, and who now struggled upright on her lap in spite of her efforts to keep him down, and, as if in sympathy with his mistress, gave vent to a series of short, yelping barks which made Miss Letitia hold her ears. \" Poor Teazle ! dear Teazle ! \" cried his mistress, taking him from Sophia's lap to her own ; \" was she cross to my beauty ? \" and she darted such a look at the unfortunate Sophia that I felt quite hot and angry, and could not help giving the young lady a look of sympathy as our eyes met. But she appeared to be afraid of exciting any pity, for she coloured violently, looked down, and in her confusion dropped her lady's reticule, and broke a bottle of salts, thereby drawing upon herself a fresh burst of pettish complaint and scolding. Miss Letitia was inclined to laugh at this catas trophe, but when she saw the fright of one lady and the angry colour which overspread the face"], [81, "MY 0 WN PEOPLE. 67 of the other, she good-naturedly stooped down and helped to pick up the bag and restore the salts to the bottle. In doing this she was seized with a violent fit of sneezing which every one of us shared, including the parrot, who, swinging himself vio lently backwards and forwards in his cage, pro duced the most unnatural, discordant sounds I ever heard, perhaps in imitation of us, and added to the general uproar. Miss Lettice was so amused by the bird's noise, the old lady's grimaces, and our continued sneez ing, that she went into a fit of laughter, in the midst of which every one else became silent and composed. I let down the window to get air and allow the salts to evaporate, and inquired of one of the out side passengers, who were all standing about, stamping their feet in the snow, how soon Uncle Roger might be expected back. Just as he was about to answer my question, I heard a distant shout across the heath. \" Can that be Uncle already ? \" I asked. \" Quite impossible, I should say,\" said the young man of whom I had asked the question ; \" I only wish it was likely.\" The shout was now repeated, and sounded nearer, and all the passengers shouted in return, to guide the person from whom the noise came, and who was doubtless a traveller who had strayed from the road like ourselves. Our elderly fellow-passenger was very angry at"], [82, "68 MY OWN PEOPLE. this, and asserted that the shouts came from high waymen, and that we should be all robbed and murdered ; though highwaymen were never heard of then, nor had been since I was quite a child. She persisted, however, that the heath swarmed with them, and succeeded in infecting Miss Letitia and Sophia with her fears, telling us a frightful story of an adventure her father, Sir George Bris towe, had had with some of these gentry, by way of raising our spirits. We heard nothing more, however, and so con cluded that the man, whoever he was, had reco vered the track, and presently we had the joyful intelligence that Uncle Roger was coming with horses, men, and lanterns. By this time the snow had almost ceased falling, and the sky had cleared a little, and when the extra horses had been harnessed to the coach, and Uncle Roger had made us swallow some brandy which he had procured in the village, we started once more, very cold and hungry, but too glad to be again on our way, to mind much about that. Two men were leading the horses across the rough ground, till we should have reached the road, about a quarter of a mile distant ; Miss Letitia was looking out of the window and re marking to Mistress Bristowe that the snow had drifted into such great heaps that the brown moor was visible here and there in patches, when she suddenly gave a little cry, and letting down the"], [83, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 69 glass, stretched her head out as far as she could, and called eagerly to the men to stop. We all clamoured to know what was the matter, but she was so agitated that she could hardly find words to gasp out : \" A man \u2014 I saw him lying on the ground there,\" and she pointed to a small and rather deep cleft in the common, overhung by gorse bushes. \" Ah ! let somebody go to him ! He must be dead or dying ! \" Mistress Bristowe gave a scream. \" I told you so ! A robber lying in wait ! We shall all be lost ! Sophia, desire the coachman to go on im mediately. Heavens ! is the girl mad ? \" as Miss Letitia, her head still out of the window, implored Uncle Roger to go to the cleft, and was for going herself with him. Uncle Roger did not need to be asked twice ; he strode towards the place to which Miss Letitia pointed, and in a few minutes shouted for help, and with the assistance of two of the passengers, brought the body of an insensible man to the coach-door. \" Can you find room for the poor fellow inside until we get to Staines r \" asked Uncle Roger. \" He is a gentleman by his dress. He will per haps revive with the warmth.'* Miss Letitia's hand was on the handle of the door in a moment, but Mistress Bristowe set up a great outcry, and said she should faint even at the sight of a dead body. \"He is not dead,\" said Uncle Roger, \"he is"], [84, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 70 only in a swoon. I can't make it out ; there is no cold to signify, unless he laid down to sleep, and that would have been sheer madness.\" \" Dead or not, I can't \" began Mistress Bris towe, when Miss Letitia interrupted her impe riously. \" Dead or not, I insist he shall be brought in side,\" said she, her eyes flashing. \"Do you know it would be murder to leave him in the cold for another hour ? \" Mistress Bristowe actually shrank before her, and Uncle Roger, with a low chuckle of intense gratification, opened the door, and, with the assist ance of the other men, placed the insensible tra veller carefully upon our side of the coach, while Miss Letitia took his head tenderly on her lap, and we proceeded on our way. Till now I had not looked at the traveller's fea tures ; indeed, it was too dark to do so ; but just as the coach-door was shut, the light of a lantern fell for an instant upon his face, and I could hardly repress a cry as I recognised Mr. Herbert ! I did suppress it, however, and I was glad of it ; for after Miss Letitia's expression of her feelings towards her unknown cousin, I felt suddenly determined that she should not know it was his head she held in her lap with such tender com passion. \" Oh for the wine I drank a minute ago, De borah ! \" she said anxiously to me ; \" it might have restored him now. His heart beats,\" she continued"], [85, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 71 laying her hand on his breast, and bending her head over him, till her fair curls fell on his face. \" Oh, Deborah ! look at him. He has seen a great deal of trouble or illness, or both, and yet he is young. Will he die, do you think ? \" \" Die ! \" I said, startled by the word out of my surprise and perplexity, \" die ! No, he cannot, he must not die. He has only become insensible from the exposure and ,\" the tears rushed to my eyes, and in my anxiety to prevent Miss Letitia from seeing them I stopped speaking ; but she was too intent upon the insensible object of her care to notice my agitation. \" His arm is broken,\" she said at last; \"he must have had a fall. Look ! \" and she showed me that the arm was evidently fractured just below the elbow, and the sleeve of the riding-coat he wore stained with the peaty soil of the heath, as if he had fallen from some height, and had come into violent contact with the ground. \" He must have been riding,\" continued she, \" and have fallen from his horse. Most likely the horse stumbled into that horrid cleft. How I wish we were at the village ! \" We proceeded in silence for a minute or two, and then, to my great astonishment, the young woman called Sophia ventured to make a remark. She believed, she said timidly, that there was a little wine in a flask, in the travelling bag some where. \" Give it me directly,\" said Miss Letitia autho-"], [86, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 72 ritatively ; but Mistress Bristowe interposed. She evidently resented poor Sophia's assertion as a great liberty. She was nearly sure the wine had been finished before they got into the coach, and she was beginning to explain that they had driven a long way across country before that, when Miss Letitia, out of all patience, cut her short by beg ging she would search, and make herself quite sure. Her manner and look again overawed Mistress Bristowe, who, turning round to Sophia, asked peevishly where the bag was ; protesting that if she did not look after everything herself, nothing would ever be found when it was wanted. A search ensued, and the bag, after the dislodgment of as many odd things as would have served for a journey to the poles, was found and opened. \" After all,\" said Mistress Bristowe, turning to me, as I was taking out the contents to get at the flask, and selfish fear getting the upper hand, \" is the young lady wise ? His linen looks fine, and if he were a gentleman, far be it from me to grudge any assistance ; but these highwaymen have a trick of looking like better people, and suppose we were to revive a thief! \" I could hardly help laughing in spite of my dis tress, but Miss Letitia was fairly roused. \" He is a man, madam, and that is enough for me. If you choose to see a fellow-creature die before your eyes for want of the help you can give him, I am sorry for you ! That is right, Sophia,\" as the flask came to light ; \" give it me quick ! \""], [87, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 73 And she opened it, and while I raised his head, poured the contents down Mr. Herbert's throat. The convulsive efforts to swallow the liquid re vived him, and he gave a low groan. \" Ah ! he begins to feel the pain of his arm,\" said Miss Letitia, with a little shudder. \"Deborah, do you think we shall soon be at the village ; and will there be a doctor there I\" \" I hope so \u2014 I trust there will. See here, Miss Letitia, there are houses \u2014 we have arrived, thank God !\" I said, as the coach finally stopped before the door of a little inn in the village street, with a water-trough and three pollarded elms in front. Our arrival created a great deal of interest among the inhabitants of the place, who surrounded the inn door, and became quite pleasantly excited when Mr. Herbert was lifted out. I took occasion to whisper the truth to Uncle Roger, and to ask him to be silent on the subject ; and to avoid his amazed questions, begged him to go for a doctor, and hurried into the house. The landlady was full of compassion for the poor gentleman, and greatly concerned at the scanty accommodation she had to offer to the unexpected guests who crowded into her house. In the mean time Mr. Herbert had been carried up-stairs and laid upon the best bed, from which the doctor, when he had seen him and set the arm, broken in two places, declared he must not be moved. This complicated matters not a little, as the bed was the only one in the house calculated to hold two ; but"], [88, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 74 we were too thankful to get any shelter and warmth for the night to be particular, except Mistress Bristowe, who grumbled and flounced, and at last made a favour of accepting the good natured hostess's own chamber. Of course I sat up to watch by Mr. Herbert, and I had some little difficulty in persuading Miss Letitia of the impropriety of her doing the same, and only induced her to retire to the tiny room close by, which was assigned to her, by the pro mise that I would come to her during the night and report the progress of my patient. This I went to do at midnight, up to which time he had slept quietly ; but when I got to her bed there was no occasion, for she too was asleep, and in a slumber like that of a child \u2014 deep and tranquil ; her lips apart, and a smile shed over her whole face, as if some happy thought had taken posses sion of her before she became unconscious. I crept back to Mr. Herbert, and as I took my seat by the bed, he stirred, opened his eyes, and knew me. To keep him from hurting himself by his exclamations of wonder and bewilderment, I told him all that happened, from the time that Miss Letitia had caught sight of him in the cleft on the heath, explaining how I came to be in the coach with her so near London. He then told me, in re turn, how he had fallen ill of fever at Marseilles, and been detained there for a month in conse quence ; how he had been riding on his way home, and, being overtaken by the snow-storm,"], [89, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 75 had missed the road ; that he had shouted several times for help, in the hope that he might be near some human habitation, but getting no answer he had ridden on till his horse fell, as he supposed, into the hole which was hidden by snow, and that pain and weakness had made him swoon. \" You would have been dead now, sir, if it had not been for Miss Letitia,\" I said ; \" but now you must not talk any longer,\" and with that I gave him a draught left by the doctor, and after seeing him fall asleep again, made up the fire, and pre pared myself to while away the long, cold night as well as I could. Thoughts are strange things, and mine ran off upon many wild subjects as I sat watching the fire. First they travelled back to the Hall ; not to the closely-curtained rooms, and the warm fire-light indoors, but to the burying-ground, and the cold, dark vault, over which I pictured to myself the snow casting its soft white mantle. I shuddered, my dears, to think of poor Madame lying out in the cold. It seemed so cruel that she should be there alone, when her husband was warm and sheltered. I think I must have been half asleep when such a senseless thought came into my head, but it haunted me even when I grew wide awake, and had a kind of painful fascination for me which I could not resist. I stared at the coals, and imagined all sorts of things that might have happened if Madame had lived ; they, came before me like so many pictures, and I was the central figure in all of them. Picture the first"], [90, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 76 represented Madame in recovered health and spirits, and I her chosen maid and faithful com panion. In picture the second, I was receiving countless brilliant offers from grand ladies in London, and refusing them all for the sake of my mistress, who loaded me with gratitude and favour in return. In picture the third, I stood on a pin nacle, alone, a model for all servants, present and to come. Yet in the midst of all this, I seemed still to see Madame, her face as I last remembered it, white and pure as marble, the sweet, melancholy eyes closed for ever, and herself lying in the damp vault, with the snow falling above her. My vain, selfish dreams were at length closed in sleep. I do not know for how long, but when I awoke the fire had sunk very low, it was very cold, and when I turned with a shiver to Mr. Herbert's bed, he was no longer there ! I remember that at this rather horrifying juncture of Nurse's story she was called away, and one thing and another prevented her resuming it for three days, during which time our curiosity was on the rack, and our attention to our lessons so ques tionable as to draw upon us the reproof of our governess. It was characteristic of Janet and Tiny then, that the former was greatly distressed at the scolding she shared in common with us, and set herself so steadfastly to resist all stray thoughts for the rest of the day, that she won back Miss"], [91, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 77 Lester to smiles and praises before she left in the evening ; whereas Tiny, half defiant, half in fun, burst out with, \" It's of no use ! I am sure you would not be able to learn, if you knew how anxious we are ! \" And when Miss Lester, alarmed at this expression, begged to know if we had had any bad news, she went into a merry, reassuring shout of laughter, and proposed to repeat the story if lessons might be dispensed with for that one after noon, which request was refused, to Tiny's im mense discontent. When at last we got Nurse to ourselves again, she went on with her narrative as follows : \u2014 When I saw that the bed was empty, I was so startled that for a time I could only stand and look, rubbing my eyes, in the hope that I was still asleep, and making painful efforts to think and understand. I could not breathe comfortably, a mist seemed to obscure everything in the room, which grew denser, I thought, and \u2014 yes ! it was no fancy ; the mist was smoke which came rolling in from the half-opened door. The house was on fire ! I darted to the door, now fully roused, and rushed to the room where Miss Letitia slept,, just opposite, with only the width of a passage between. In doing so, I stumbled over something on the floor, lost my balance, and fell. I can even now recall the dreadful, struggling effort to escape from the insensibility which overcame me, I suppose from the suffocating atmosphere. I never could"], [92, "78 MY OWN PEOPLE. otherwise account for my loss of consciousness at that terrible moment, when I would have given worlds to have doubled every faculty. I do not know how long I lay there, but I was restored to life by feeling myself rather roughly handled, and a sense of sharp, stinging pain in my hands and arms. \" Come out of the house if you would not be burnt to death ! \" cried the voice of a man who helped me to my feet. I was fully sensible in a moment. \" Miss Letitia and Mr. Herbert ! Where are they ? \" I cried, in an agony, as a rush of hot air swept across my cheek, and I heard cries and shouts on all sides ; \" let me go to them ! \" and I tried frantically to get back to the bedroom door. But the man who had roused me, and whom I recognised as one of the passengers on the coach the day before, seized me in a strong grasp. \"Are you mad?\" he cried; \"the staircase may fall ! Every one is safe,\" and he bore me down and out of the house, in spite of my struggles for liberty. A few minutes only had passed, and we were all huddled together in the small room of a neighbouring house \u2014 a shivering, half-dressed assembly, \u2014 but all loud in congratulations to themselves and to one another on their safety, whereas I was tortured with dread and anxiety, for I saw neither Mr. Herbert nor Miss Letitia. Directly my preserver let go his hold on my arm, I turned upon him. I was half out of my mind, which must be my excuse for my rudeness"], [93, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 79 and want of gratitude to one who had doubtless saved my life. \" I will never forgive you,\" I gasped, \" never, unless you go back instantly, and take me with you to look for them ! \" I seized hold of him\u2014 I was frantic. \" I am going back to help to put out the fire,\" said he, with a good-humoured smile, \"but if you mean the young gentleman we picked up on the heath, he is safe and sound at the Parsonage by this time, and the young lady too, so you may as well be civil.\" \" At the Parsonage ! How do you know ? \" I said, with a wicked suspicion that he only said so to save himself from trouble. \" Because I saw him carried off there by your uncle, and the young lady charged me to come back and see you safe, which I've done,\" and he turned away and went out of the room, leaving me ready to sob with the revulsion of feeling, and unable to say a word of thanks. I put up a thanks giving to God, and looked round for some one who could tell me the way to the Parsonage, when I was arrested by the voice of Mistress Bristowe. \" You had better go and look after your young lady, I think,\" she said, tossing her head, \" for she is gone with the young man, and a great fuss she made over him \u2014 in my young days it was the gen tlemen who helped the ladies \u2014 and he a stranger too, and she only in her dressing-gown, with her hair all down her back,\" and Mistress Bristowe"], [94, "80 MY OWN PEOPLE. again shook her head, priding herself in the thought that her hair at all events was hidden from the public gaze by a structure which was formed of her night-cap, two Indian handkerchiefs, and her bonnet surmounting all. Poor Sophia, close behind her mistress, stood looking scared and cold, wrapped in a cloak over her night-dress, and encumbered with the weight of the parrot's cage, which she was not allowed to set down or part writh. \" I shall certainly go, madam,\" I said, in answer to Mistress Bristowe, \" if I can get any one to show me the way ; and as for gentlemen helping ladies, why I suppose that can hardly be expected, when they have broken arms and high fevers ! \" I was so angry that I was going out without waiting for any directions about the way, and for getting that I had no shawl to shelter me from the night air, when the lady exclaimed : \" Bless the girl ! she has got no wraps ; she will catch her death of cold ! Sophy, give her my cardinal.\" I never was more astonished, but I have often had occasion to remark since, that the most dis agreeable, and seemingly selfish people, may possess sparks of hidden kindness, which some times break out, as it were, in spite of them selves. It was five o'clock, and a more miserable, raw morning could hardly be conceived. The moon was fortunately nearly full, and served to guide me up the little ill-paved, irregular village street, where"], [95, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 81 at every step I met knots of people hurrying down to the scene of the fire ; while hastily lighted candles in most of the houses threw sickly gleams of light out upon the mass of mud and melting snow in the road, and served only to make every object look more hopelessly wet and dismal. Before I had reached the Parsonage, which was only a few hundred yards up the street, I met Uncle Roger. He was very thankful to see me, for he had been in great anxiety about my safety, and was coming in search of me. He bade me go on to Miss Letitia, while he went back to assist in putting out the now smouldering remains of the fire, and to try and recover the clothes and property we had left in the inn. I followed his directions, and as I came up to the Parsonage, Miss Letitia was standing at the door, and gave a cry of joy when she saw me. \" Oh, Deborah ! \" she said, \" thank God you are safe ! He, my cousin Herbert I mean, has been blaming himself for not being able to find you. Ah ! why did not you tell me who he was ? I can't dislike him now, for he says I have twice saved his life.\" \"Let me come and see him,\" I said: \" I want to know what became of him, what made him leave his bed \u2014 how is he ? \" and hurrying question upon question, I was led by Miss Letitia into a snug little parlour, looking like a paradise of warm comfort, for a fire had been already kindled in it, and the Rector's old housekeeper was preparing some tea. G"], [96, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 82 \"Where is he ?\" I repeated, looking round. \" Up-stairs, waiting for your Uncle Roger, who has gone to fetch some clothes for him and for me too, if he can, for oh, Deborah ! my things are most likely burnt. But I don't care now you and every one are safe.\" She was not quite in such a plight as Mistress Bristowe had described ; for she had her travelling cloak over her dressing-gown, and a curious look of half-veiled joy and triumph shone in her eyes, and made her, in spite of her deshabille, look dig nified as well as beautiful. \"What do you mean by saving his life, Miss Letitia ? \" I asked. \" Well, he says so,\" she replied, with a sudden blush ; \" but it was only this \u2014 sit down here, poor Deborah, you look half-starved with cold \u2014 I awoke at about four o'clock, I suppose, and fancied the room was very smoky ; and then I heard a curious, crackling noise, which sounded like blazing wood. I listened and listened, and presently sat up and looked about me, saw a light under my door, jumped out of bed and opened it. In rushed the smoke, and there was the fire, creeping along the skirting-board like a horrid, crawling, live thing,\" and she shuddered, \" and a heap near my door, which I just made out to be two figures lying insensible, one on the top oi the other. \"At first I felt as if I could do nothing, but only stand still and watch stupidly, but I shook off the feeling after a few moments, and screamed"], [97, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 83 ' Fire ! ' as loud as I was able, and running along the passage, knocked at the nearest doors till the people came hurrying out. Oh, Deborah ! people are dreadfully selfish when their lives are in danger ; at least these were. They would have trampled over the two insensible people lying there, if I had not guarded them. I think it was more horrible to see their ghastly, frightened faces, than to look on the fire, which began to leap up the wall with a lapping sound, like a wild beast thirsting for blood. Not one of them would heed my entreaties for help, except one brave man, God bless him ! who stopped, and bidding me follow him as quickly as I could, seized the uppermost figure, a man, and bore him away. As his head hung down over his deliverer's shoulder, I re cognised the face of the traveller whom we had picked up the day before, and then a dread came over me that we had left you behind. When we got down-stairs I begged and prayed the stranger to go up again and fetch you, while I sat down outside on the edge of the water-trough, and held the traveller's head on my lap, for fear his poor broken arm should get hurt. Ah ! what a ten minutes I spent there, while he was gone, and people were screaming and running and shouting around me, and the flames mounting higher, and I thought he would never come back. \"At last Master Roger, who you know was sleeping somewhere else in the place, came run ning up, and seeing me, and hearing my story, he"], [98, "84 MY OWN PEOPLE. lifted up my cousin, \u2014 it was then I first knew he was my cousin, Deborah, from what your uncle said, \u2014 and with the help of another man carried him off to the Parsonage, where every one said he was sure of shelter and care. \" For a minute I felt as if we were leaving you to death, but I trusted to that brave man's eyes, and felt sure that he would not leave the house as long as you were in it.\" \" He told me he saw Mr. Herbert carried off, and that you had gone with him,\" I said. \"He must have seen us from the windows. I don't know how I can ever thank him as he deserves. But, ah ! Deborah, your hand ! \" cried Miss Letitia, with a slight scream ; \" you are burnt after all.\" In the excitement of the past half-hour, I had forgotten the pain which had been partly the cause of my coming to myself, but the heat of the room was now reviving it, and on examination I found that I had burnt my hands a good deal ; the skin of my arms was also scorched, and the sleeves of my dress destroyed. The good housekeeper ran for cotton wool, and Miss Letitia insisted on bind ing them up herself. She had a sort of feeling of having deserted me, and wished to make amends, she said ; and though I was ashamed to have her waiting on me so, I could not prevent it. Uncle Roger now appeared with the trunk on his back, and a man following him with Mr. Herbert's valise, which some one had picked up"], [99, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 85 near him, where he had fallen. He told us the fire was quite out, but that nearly everything inside the house had been burnt, so it was fortunate for us that all our luggage, except a few necessaries, had been left in the inn yard. He then went up stairs ; with the aid of the housekeeper Miss Letitia was soon dressed, and a few minutes after, Mr. Herbert appeared, looking very wan in the dim light of the November morning, but with no trace of fever which I had been so afraid of for him. He was placed upon the sofa, and held out his uninjured hand to me, and said: \"I should never have forgiven myself, nor any one else, if any harm had happened to you, Deb. What had be come of you ? \" \" Nay, what had become of you, sir ? \" I said. \" I am ashamed to say I fell asleep instead of watching, and when I awoke, you were gone.\" \" Then I am worse than I thought myself,\" said Mr. Herbert ; \" for when I awoke and saw smoke making its way into the room, and smelt fire, I groped my way out of bed as well as I could, for the fire was out and the room in darkness, and called your name ; I got no answer, and so con cluded the room was empty.\" \" Go on, sir, please. What became of you ? \" \" You must ask my cousin,\" he said, pointing to Miss Letitia, who was busy pouring out more tea ; \" I only know that the pain in my arm, or weak ness, or perhaps both, made me faint before I had gone more than a yard from the door.\""], [100, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 86 \" And I fell over you, sir,\" I said ; at which we all laughed. We could afford to do that, now we were all safe and together. And now we proceeded to discuss plans. Uncle Roger proposed hiring a horse, and riding back as fast as he could to take tidings of our safety to the squire and the young ladies, and as we were only a stage from London, that we should set out again, so as to reach the city by nightfall, if we were all sufficiently recovered from our fright and fatigues to do so. He looked at Mr. Herbert, doubting if he were well enough, but he declared himself perfectly able to travel the short distance, if his aunt would receive him, and it was settled that we should all go together to Lady Ridge way's house. The day proved mild, and the snow was disap pearing as quickly as it had come. After a plentiful breakfast, and an exchange of courteous messages between ourselves and the hospitable old clergyman, who had been such a good Samaritan to us, and whose infirmities prevented his rising so early to receive our thanks, Miss Letitia and I left the Parsonage and walked down to the coach yard. There were many delays before starting, while people lamented over their missing property, and insisted upon searching among the ruins for im possible things. Mistress Bristowe, for instance, declared she had dropped a Flanders lace hand kerchief in coming down-stairs, and would have Sophy go to look for it, though she was told that"], [101, "87 MY OWN PEOPLE. the staircase was destroyed. Then every one began loudly to discuss the origin of the fire, in which, of course, as no one knew anything about it, no one agreed. And, lastly, a subscription was set on foot for the landlord, to which every one gave libe rally, and Mistress Bristowe the largest sum of all. While all this was going on, we were looking eagerly for our brave preserver, and seeing nothing of him, I asked the coachman where he was. \" If you mean John Wild, the grazier, he is gone home this hour,\" said he. \" Home ! \" I repeated, dismayed. \" Yes ; he lives nigh hereabouts. I've known him ever since he was a little chap, and his father before him.\" I was terribly vexed, and Miss Letitia hardly less so. I had never once thanked him for his sav ing Mr. Herbert's life ; nay, I had given him hard words, and had spoken sharply at the very moment when he had risked his own for me. Miss Letitia took out pencil and paper, and wrote a note on the leaf of her pocket-book, which the coachman pro mised to deliver to him. But no written words could express my feelings, and the knowledge that he would always think me ungrateful weighed for a long time heavily on my mind. At last everything was ready. People took their seats, and we set off. We stopped to take up Mr. Herbert, and then, labouring along the roads, heavy with a mixture of melting snow and mire, finally reached Chelsea at three o'clock in the"], [102, "88 MY OWN PEOPLE. afternoon, thankful to find rest and shelter at last after our long and adventurous journey. And so at length I was in London, and, as is often the case when we have longed very eagerly for a thing, hardly able to enjoy it, now I was there. The pain in my hands and arms had in creased, and made me feverish, and, whether it was from the same cause or from the sounds in the road, so new to me, I could not sleep, and was so unwell the next morning that the doctor sent for to Mr. Herbert paid me a visit, and ordered me to remain in bed the whole day. That day in bed taught me a great deal. At first I had to struggle with a feeling of intense mortification, as I thought over the events of the previous night, and put them in order in my mind. I, who would have liked to go through unheard-of dangers, and to have been the heroine of the adventure, had been instead quite useless, unrecog nised and half-forgotten. It was a great punishment, and after a time I learned to think it a fitting punishment for the vain thoughts with which I had been pleasing myself, not only on the night of the fire, but for many previous days and weeks and months. It is wonderful how much better you can bear a painful thing when you have once brought yourself to look upon it as deserved. As I lay and thought, I was at first angry, rest less, feverish, and miserable ; before the day was"], [103, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 89 over, I was able to say to myself, \" Deborah, you have been abominably vain and unpardonably sel fish ; you deserve a great deal more than you have got ;\" and from that moment the sting was gone. In about a week I was quite recovered. Mr. Herbert's arm turned out on examination to have been badly set, and he had to submit to a second operation, which in his weak state brought on a fresh attack of fever. I remained to wait on him, and while so employed I received a letter from Miss Ann, telling me of Uncle Roger's safe arrival, and begging that I would, if not inconve nient to Lady Ridgeway, remain and nurse her brother until he was able to travel home. So it was that instead of a week in London I stayed three months. When my anxiety for Mr. Herbert was over, I enjoyed those three months to the full. I was never tired of looking out of the window upon the river; the wooden bridge, which was lighted with lamps at night \u2014 a novelty then ; the houses of Battersea village on the opposite side ; and the people, who kept passing and repassing in a way that dazzled my country eyes. I used to walk out with one or another of my lady's servants, sometimes under the trees in Cheyne Walk, where the quality paced up and down at a certain hour every day ; sometimes across the bridge to Batter sea Fields ; and once we went a whole party in a boat to Kew, and saw Queen Charlotte driving with Lady Cremorne, who was a great friend of Lady Ridgeway's and Miss Letitia's godmother."], [104, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 90 I also went to see the Tower of London, the Fleet Prison, and the Bank of England. But I enjoyed most of all, with a deep, quiet enjoyment, which I take to be the best, my sleep ing-room in the attic of the great old house. It was so high, that at first it made me dizzy to look out of the window; but I soon got used to that, and then there was nothing I liked so well as to stand and watch the river shining and flowing under the moonlight, the swans floating with the stream like white spirits, their necks and wings touched with silver, and the many twinkling lights reflected on the water. I am told it is all changed now ; but I shall never forget the influence it had upon me then, nor the fascination with which I from my little attic window looked down upon the shining world beneath me. Mr. Herbert got rapidly better when once he began to mend, and by the end of November was able to rise from his bed and get about a little, though still looking pale and melancholy. Old Lady Ridgeway, whom I shall always remember as one of the sweetest and most beautiful persons I ever saw, used to try her utmost to divert his mind by her sprightly conversation and amusing anec dotes of her past life ; for her husband had been a foreign ambassador, and she had seen more of foreign places and customs than most people. But I used to think Miss Letitia was his best medicine. I don't know who could have been melancholy for long with that bright creature constantly before"], [105, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 91 their eyes, and the sound of her joyous voice in their ears. I had more opportunities for judging than you may think, for I had, I may say, the entire care of Mr. Herbert, and therefore was oftener in the drawing-room for one thing or another than I otherwise should have been. He would come down towards midday, often looking so worn and weary that it hurt me to see him ; but an hour after, when I went to take him some refreshment, he would be lying on the sofa, watch ing Miss Letitia as she flitted about the room, now at her flowers in the window, now winding silks for her aunt, or perhaps writing a letter at the old lady's dictation, and his face would have cleared, and his eyes would look, not cheerful, but quiet and satisfied. I was sure how it would be in the end ; but I don't think Mr Herbert knew himself the pleasure the sight of her gave him until he had recovered sufficiently to think of going home. The evening after he had spoken his thought, I waited upon Miss Letitia instead of her own maid, who had gone for a holiday; and while I was brushing her hair, I saw that she was struggling to keep back tears from her eyes. Presently she said \u2014 \" Deborah, you must give my dear, dear love to my cousins, and my duty to my uncle, when you go back, and take a letter and a packet from me to them.\" \" Yes, miss,\" I said."], [106, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 92 \" And you must take a present for Betty, too, from me. You shall go and choose it to morrow.\" \" Thank you, miss. Betty will not know how to say enough for such goodness.\" \" Say ! But she may never see me again, you know, Deborah, to tell me if she likes it ;\" and she looked so wistfully up at me that the tears again came into her eyes. She went on rather quickly, \" I think my cousin looks nearly well again now, Deborah. Chelsea air has not hurt him.\" \" No, miss ; he looks better than I ever saw him \u2014 and happier, too,\" I could not help adding. \" Does he ? He is very grave sometimes. He hardly ever smiles when he speaks, but he is happy, I dare say, at the thought of going home. Deborah, why did you never tell me it was cousin Herbert that night ? \" I had often wondered she had not asked me the question before. \" Well,\" I said, \" I can hardly tell ; but I think it was because you had said just before that you could never like him, and I was vexed.\" She made no answer to that, but after a silence said suddenly \u2014 \" That will do, Deborah. You have brushed my hair long enough. To-morrow I shall be forced to have it powdered for that hateful ball.\" \" Hateful, miss ! \" I exclaimed. \" I thought you loved dancing.\" \" Yes, sometimes ; but I would rather stay at"], [107, "MY OWA' PEOPLE. 93 home to-morrow. Oh, dear Deborah ! how I wish I could go back with you ! \" \"So do I, miss, with all my heart,\" I said. \" Do you ? You won't let them all forget me ? You will talk to Ann about me sometimes ?\" and then her lip trembled, and she burst out crying. I asked if she were unwell \u2014 if I should call some one \u2014 if she would take anything ; but she shook her head, and soon recovered herself enough to say \u2014 \" I am silly to-night. Don't tell any one ; there's a good Deborah.\" \" If there is anything I can do \" I began. \" No, no ; I am quite well indeed. Pray say nothing to my aunt or to \u2014 to any one. Good night.\" I went away, hoping vehemently that Mr. Her bert would find out his happiness before he left Chelsea, and wishing that it were possible forme to say or do something to further it. But no word or deed of mine was needed. The night after the ball she called me to her room, that she might see the gown and cloak I had bought for Betty. \" Betty shall thank me with her own mouth, after all,\" said she joyously. I looked up inquiringly. \" Can't you guess, Deborah ; or shall I have to tell you ? \" she asked, blushing all over. And of course I guessed."], [108, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 94 \" And the picture, Nurse ? \" I asked, looking at it with fresh interest. \" She had two painted before she married \u2014 one for Miss Ann and one for me ; because, as she said in her sweet way, I had nursed Mr. Herbert, and Mr Herbert's wife and child.\" \" And the brave man who saved your life ? \" asked Janet. \" Ah, well, my dear, that may serve some day for another story.\""], [109, "IV. T JANET HARRINGTON, am going to write -A- what I have heard of Nurse's story respecting John Wild, as I have gathered it from herself and from others who knew the circumstances. My sister Mabel has never heard it. Dear old Deborah once told me the outlines, which have since been filled in and coloured from other sources. The modest, faithful creature told me only, because she said Tiny and Mabel were too young at the time to know anything about a love story. But it will come in appropriately here among the Family Chronicles, and it will do them no harm to hear for once a true record of self-sacrificing affection. Two years after my grandfather's second marri age, the old squire, his father, died, and the family estate passed to his son. This was in the year 1805. Charlotte had married in the interval, and Letitia was urgent upon the two remaining sisters to stay at the Hall, and continue to make it their home. But Ann's good sense objected to the arrangement (though she fully appreciated the affection which dictated it), and a few weeks"], [110, "96 MY OWN PEOPLE. after the new master and mistress had taken pos session, she and Dorothy removed to a small house which their brother presented to them, situated on the estate, and only some few miles distant from the Hall, and where, with the moderate fortunes left them by their father, they hoped to live in comfort and happiness. But a cloud was already gathering over Herbert's head which threatened to darken his life, and through him, to involve the affectionate hearts of the two sisters in its gloom. One morning a legal-looking letter arrived for the squire. It lay on the table side by side with one full of tender, loving words from a friend of Letitia's, a happy bride of eight months. Herbert broke the seals and read, while his wife smiled over her crossed foolscap sheet of gossip, and his face grew pale. Contrary to his wont, he put the letter into his pocket without handing it to his wife, or making any remark on its contents, and instead of joining her in her morning stroll round the pleasure-ground, went straight to his library and was seen no more that morning. The next day there arrived at the hall a post chaise, out of which stepped a gentleman who was closeted for more than a hour with the squire, and left as quietly as he came. Letitia, some little time afterwards, went into the library with her baby on her arm, to look for her husband, and found him with his head bent down over his arms, which were resting upon the table. She went up and laid her gentle hand upon his hair, and the"], [111, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 97 baby gave a delighted little utterance at the action. He raised his pale, set face, held out his arms for the child, and while his wife knelt near him, he told her the secret of his visitor. \" He is a lawyer, my Lettice, and comes in behalf of Monsieur Salterre, my first wife's uncle.\" \" What has he to do with you ? Do you owe him anything ? \" she asked surprised. \"Listen, and you shall know. When I first made Monsieur Salterre's acquaintance in Paris, he was one of the richest and most respected bankers in that city ; but the breaking out of the Revolution affected him as it did nearly every one, and a sudden run upon the bank was the result. He satisfied the demands of his clients, but in so doing he was left nearly bankrupt himself, and unless any one could be found to advance him money on credit he was ruined. He was in an agony at his approaching failure ; the word meant death to him. I offered him my name and credit as a partner, I promised that he might count upon the sum he required from the fortune I must inherit from my father, I pressed him to accept my aid. In short, I loved his niece, as you know,\" he drew his wife closer to him, \" and I gained her, and loaded myself with a debt which, until my last journey to France, I had looked upon as merely nominal. But Monsieur Salterre then told me that the war with England had struck a terrible blow at his financial prosperity ; that my name and credit had, up to that time, kept him from ii"], [112, "98 MY OWN PEOPLE. ruin ; and spoke as if he reckoned on the sum I had so rashly promised, to save him now. \"Of course, my promise must be kept, and I told him so ; but he saw my perturbation, for it was agony to think of having to inflict another blow on my father, whom I had already so deeply wounded ; and he promised that, unless he were hard pressed, he would not urge me to abide by my word. Times would mend \u2014 had already par tially mended \u2014 and he should always look on me as his preserver, whether he owed me the money or not. I suppose the anxiety which oppressed me, after my conversation with Monsieur Salterre, was the reason of the fever which overtook me at Mar seilles.\" \" Ah, my poor Herbert ! \" \" Don't look at me with those eyes till you know all,\" he said with a groan. \" I do know ; this gentleman wants his money. He has sent his lawyer to tell you so this morning. How much is it, Herbert ? \" \" More than you think, and it will involve more than the mere sound.\" \"Tell me,\" she whispered, laying her cheek to his. \" Fifteen thousand pounds.\" There was a silence, and he drooped his head lower, away from her sweet face and sympathizing eyes. \" Herbert, don't hide yourself from me. What will you do ? What can I do for you \\ Only tell me.\""], [113, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 99 \" I must raise the money by a mortgage, or part with the estate.\" \" Part with the estate ! \" she echoed in dismay. \" Ah ! no wonder you shrink,\" he said mourn fully ; \" and I never told you before you married me that this might come upon you. And yet I never thought it woidd come. My sister's marriage portions have swallowed up most of the ready money. My father always lived up to his income \u2014 you know how generous and hospitable he was \u2014 how could he know that his son had promised away what was not his ! \" Here the baby on his knee began to crow and laugh in infantine rapture. \" Ah, baby ! \" he said bitterly, \" I am glad you are not a son to reproach me in future for having lessened your inheritance.\" \" But, Herbert, is there not some way by which you can pay your debt without leaving our dear home ? Cannot you raise the money in any other way ? \" \" No, except by mortgaging, which I will not do ; I would rather give it up at once.\" \" And will it be very dreadful if you do ? \" asked his wife. \" I mean, would you care so very, very much ? \" \" Would you care, Lettice ? \" \" Yes, certainly ; but with you and baby I should be happy still. You can only mean to leave for a time ? Let us look the matter in the face, Herbert.\" \" I have done so. 1 have calculated that I must"], [114, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 100 let the place for ten years \u2014 ten years of exile ; then by selling a couple of the more valuable farms, I might raise the sum, which I can borrow now on securities. But we should have to live in a way to w-hich you have never been accustomed.\" \"Never mind that. I am young, and can accustom myself to anything ; and my husband must not break one-tenth part of his word for the sake of any woman breathing. Nay ! do not look so sad, I can bear anything but that.\" \" My darling wife ! And you forgive me for not telling you this before our marriage ? \" \" I forgive you anything and everything,\" said she cheerfully, \"if you will promise to keep no thing from me in future. Promise, Herbert,\" she repeated in a more serious tone. \" I do promise, my helpmate,\" said he with tender emphasis, as he rose and restored his child to her arms. So it was settled that the Hall was to be let. Deborah Standish was at this time nurse to the squire's little daughter, and as was natural from what has been already known of her, she enjoyed the perfect trust, and something more than the usual amount of affection and confidence which are accorded to well-tried servants. She was now twenty-five, and had developed into a fine, tall young woman, whose healthful complexion, clear eyes, and expression of sense and spirit were her chief points of attraction. She was acquainted by her master and mistress"], [115, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 101 with their change of fortunes, and with the conse quent reduction of their establishment, for they had decided upon retaining only three servants. Deborah held the child tighter in her arms as her mistress spoke. Was she telling her all this pre paratory to discharging her ? She mentally deter mined to resist to the death, and when Letitia began falteringly, \" Deborah, you know how I love you, and I cannot bear the idea of parting with you \" \" Bless you, madam, for saying so ! \" cried Deborah, bursting into tears ; \" I don't care what you take from my wages, if I may stay with you. How could I be happy anywhere else ? \" Deborah accordingly remained at reduced wages and increased duties, which she fulfilled well and faithfully when they devolved upon her. It was a beautiful autumn day when she and her master and mistress, with little Nelly, turned their backs upon the Hall and set out for their new home in a small town in one of the Midland Counties. It was a bustling place, and as they drove into it, after two days' travelling, the contrast it presented to the smooth, sunny slopes and whispering woods they had left behind, struck painfully upon the eyes of the husband and wife ; more perhaps upon the latter than the former, and yet she showed it the least. The truth was that he was feeling acutely for her, and she was determined he should not see that she was suffering at all. Besides, a woman has a greater facility for hiding her feelings than a"], [116, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 102 man ; and also she is almost always happy when she is with those she loves, whatever external cir cumstances may be. After all, the small house in which they were to live was far from being either repulsive or cheer less. It stood a little back from the high street, enclosed from the publicity of that somewhat noisy thoroughfare by a high wall with a chevaux de frise, through which a small door led to the house. Behind, the windows looked across a road to a wide, flat meadow which nearly surrounded the town, and where the sun shone, and the grass was flecked with long, flying shadows which came and went over the daisies. On this side of the house was a small garden, fenced off, it is true, by the walls of neighbouring houses on each side, and enviously shorn of its proportions by a railing in front ; but, as Letitia said, a garden for all that, and one in which something might be made to grow beyond those tall bunches of Michaelmas daisies and golden rod which disputed the ground with coarse grass and neglected rose bushes. Indoors, things needed all Deborah's vigorous activity and handiness to be made to look at all homelike. The rooms were dark and rather low, the papers ugly, and the furniture old fashioned. But the amount of energy and taste expended upon them, together with some few articles from the Hall, wrought miracles, and at the end of a month the good people of East fleet, who came to pay their respects to the new-"], [117, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 103 comers, went away marvelling at the transforma tion. Meantime the baby throve and grew, and enjoyed life apparently as much as it had done among more costly surroundings. Deborah carried it out every day in the meadows aforesaid, and there it inhaled all the precious influences of air and sunshine and sweetness, which are so necessary to a baby's well doing. The winter passed, during which time nothing of note happened but the receipt of letters from Monsieur Salterre, full of grateful thanks for the loan, which he confidently hoped to repay in a few years, when his credit should be fully re-estab lished, and the times should mend. Letitia's sunny spirits and brave heart made sunshine indoors in spite of clouds and cold without, and Deborah contrived that the household should be well ordered and maintained, and that neither husband nor wife should do more than suspect that she was the mainspring which kept the machinery going. She found out a relation in the town who had married and settled there some few years before, and now kept a glove-shop on the Market Hill, but beyond going there occasionally to drink tea, Deborah never went out, nor did she make any acquaint ances in the place. She knew that she could be ill-spared, and she was too happy in the know ledge, and the sense of usefulness it gave her, to desire anything more. One day, early in February, Herbert and his"], [118, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 104 wife went to pay some visits in the town, and Deborah, as usual, took out' the little Nelly for a walk. It was a still afternoon, and she pur sued her accustomed way along a path which led across the meadows. She had nearly reached the middle of the great flat grass expanse, when she perceived that a large herd of cattle were being driven across it, and were coming in her direction. For a moment she doubted if she should go on, but the cattle looked quiet, and she considered that if she turned back now they must overtake her before she could reach a place of safety, so she went boldly forward. No sooner had she got into the middle of the herd, than she repented her decision. Some of the animals had a wild, over driven look that alarmed her, and she heartily wished herself safe back in the town. She walked on, however, holding the child tightly in her arms, and half scorning herself for the fluttering at her heart, which seemed to impede her breath and make her limbs un steady. She had passed the greater part of the drove, and was beginning to draw breath more easily, when all at once she was startled by one of the animals breaking away from the herd and dashing furiously past her, and terrified to see that several others were lowering their horns and glancing restlessly at her out of their blood-shot eyes. She had begun to be seriously frightened, when she perceived a man, evidently not one of the drovers,"], [119, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 105 making his way towards her among the moving mass, and before she had time to ask help, or hardly to feel relieved, he had pushed aside one or two of the intruding heads with powerful arms, and taking the child from her with a grave but decisive energy she had no power to resist, walked sturdily on with rapid steps, keeping one hand on her arm till the herd had passed and the way was free. Then he as gravely restored the child to her arms without saying a word. It was all done so suddenly, and the stranger seemed to look upon it so much as a matter of course, that when Deborah began some earnest thanks for his help, he shrugged his shoulders, in a disclaiming manner, and seemed on the point of turning away, but as he lifted two very grave blue eyes to her face, they suddenly lighted with a smile, and he remarked quietly, \" You are say ing more than there is any need for this time.\" Deborah was completely puzzled. Where could she have seen that rather peculiar smile, which seemed almost out of place on a stern face, before ? She said nothing, however, but went quietly on, all her limbs trembling from her recent alarm, but resolute in keeping herself still, while the baby stared gravely at the stranger, who con tinued to walk by her side. At last he stopped and said, \" You are quite safe now, but I would not advise you to trust either yourself or a child into the middle of a herd of cattle again.\""], [120, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 106 Again that curious feeling of having seen or heard the man or the voice before, which some times comes over a person so unaccountably as to induce a belief in a pre-existence. Not that this idea came into Deborah's strong, practical mind at all ; she was merely bewildered, and had barely time to reiterate her thanks before the stranger bid her good day, and turning round, walked away. When she related the occurrence to her mis tress, Letitia, after her first feelings of alarm and thankfulness about her child, said, \" Deborah, how could you have such a short memory ? I have guessed who the stranger was without seeing him ! The very same who saved you from the fire ! How curious that he should appear again just when you were in danger ! I wish I could see him ; I have so much to thank him for,\" and she went with moistened eyes to tell her husband, leaving Deborah deeply mortified at having a second time missed the opportunity of thanking her preserver. If the truth must be told, she thought more about that curious smile and those grave blue eyes, during the following few days, than she would have quite liked to confess even to herself: and whenever she went out for her daily walks with little Nelly, she found herself wishing that she could see them again. This, however, was natural, she said to herself, for no one likes to be thought ungrateful ; and his few words to her had made her sure that he must still consider her so."], [121, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 107 One evening she went to drink tea with her cousin, Mrs. Davies, the glover's wife on the Market Hill. Nelly had been unusually fretful all day, and her faithful nurse was reluctant to leave her ; but Letitia insisted. The mother was at times almost jealous of Deborah's affection for the little girl. So she went, and when she entered the parlour behind the shop, there were the identical blue eyes, and the man to whom they belonged sitting in familiar conversation with Mrs. Davies. \" We have got an old friend to drink tea with us to-night, Cousin,\" said Mrs. Davies, by way of introduction, as she came forward to greet her. \" John Wild, from near Staines, London way. He and my husband are related, and he mostly comes in to sup when he is this way.\" John Wild got up and held out his hand to Deborah. \"I am not sure,\" he said gravely, \" whether we are old friends or not.\" \" I should not think / deserved that name, at all events,\" said poor Deborah, flushing. \"Why, what is all this?\" exclaimed the aston ished Mrs. Davies ; \" when did you ever see one another ?\" \" I saw this young woman four years ago, come next Whitsuntide,\" said John Wild quaintly, \" and then she all but boxed my ears, which I did not like at all ; and I saw her again four days ago, and she never so much as remembered me, which I liked still less.\""], [122, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 108 Mrs. Davies looked from him to Deborah's glow ing face, completely mystified. She was at all times a woman of many words, and when at all confused she grew so hopelessly verbose, that it was difficult to extract any mean ing at all from her involved flow of sentences. \"It was wonderful,\" she said now, \"how people and things turned up when least expected \u2014 that red morocco-box of hers, for instance, which had come to light on purpose to provoke her, she really thought, that very morning, just as her husband had bought her another, and a very handsome one it was too, and cost a deal of money. But as for Deborah boxing ears, if she had ever done such a thing to a stranger it was past her comprehension ; and what could John Wild mean about old friends ? She should have said friends always knew one another, though certainly she was a bad hand herself at recollecting faces, and once had mis taken the parish clerk at a distance for her own husband, though he was a stout, ugly man, where as her Richard was well-looking enough for any thing \u2014 perhaps she should not say so, but many people remarked the same thing ; \" and here she broke down helplessly, as she discovered how far she had drifted from the subject of Deborah's unaccountable conduct. To cover her defeat she laid hands upon her cousin, and took her up stairs to get off her bonnet and shawl. Then she got the clue to the riddle which had so dis turbed her."], [123, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 109 \" I must go down and thank him now, Cousin Davies, while no one is there,\" Deborah said in conclusion to her tale ; \" please don't come for a few minutes,\" and she ran away without waiting for an answer. John Wild was standing looking out of the window as she entered, and as he did not turn round she suddenly grew shy, and made a movement to go back again ; but shyness was a novel sensation to Deborah and it soon passed, and she came forward and began to speak. At the first sound of her voice he turned quickly and faced her. He was a very tall man \u2014 I write from Deborah's description \u2014 with broad shoulders and a look of power about him which, together with his honest face, made one trust him instinctively. His countenance was grave and almost stern, very stern it could be at times, his hair curly and flaxen, his complexion ruddy with exposure, and his eyes deeply set and very blue. At first sight you would have said, \" that man may be slow to provoke, but he looks as if his anger, once roused, would be deep and lasting.\" But when you had spoken to him once or twice, and had seen him smile, a feeling of confidence would take the place of your distrust, and you would know that you were in the company of a perfectly honest, generous nature, and one capable of infinite kindness and tender ness. Such was the man who now turned to Deborah as she spoke, and begged him to believe that she was not, and never had been, ungrateful to him,"], [124, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 110 as her hasty words on the night of the fire had no doubt caused him to think. \" And suppose I never thought so,\" he said with a smile ; \" suppose I had liked the girl who could forget herself in her anxiety for her mistress, all the better for her sharp words to me ? \" \" Why, then, I should be very glad of it,\" said Deborah frankly. \" Would you ? well then it was so, and we may as well shake hands on it,\" said the stalwart grazier, extending his to Deborah, who took it with a simple frankness which equalled her words. The little transaction was hardly over when Mrs. Davies looked into the room a little fearfully, and so much as if she expected to find the occu pants engaged in mortal combat, that Deborah laughed outright. \" She has not boxed my ears this time,\" ex plained John Wild, \" she's made it up with me, and we've shaken hands upon it.\" \" I'm glad of it,\" said Mrs. Davies, still a little nervous ; \" I'm sure I didn't know Deborah could ever do such a thing, though I do remember her flying out once when she was a child, and her Uncle Roger shutting her up in the cow-house. Deborah, do you recollect that ? No ? Dear, dear, it seems almost like yesterday to me.\" \" She's mended her manners now,\" said John Wild with sly gravity, \" and has well-nigh pro mised she won't box my ears any more.\""], [125, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 111 Mr. Davies now appeared from the shop, and they sat down to tea, during which meal his wife could not refrain from telling all the particulars of their acquaintance with one another, in spite of Deborah's entreating looks and gestures. She was annoyed, too, at seeing that John Wild appeared to enjoy the recital in his silent way, though half of it was simply imaginary, and the colour gradually mounted and overspread her face from vexation. As she sat in this uncomfortable, half-irritable state, some one entered the shop and was heard inquiring hastily for Deborah Standish. Deborah recognised the voice of one of her fellow servants, and started up with a pang at her heart, which was soon justified by the intelligence she brought. The baby was very ill, Letitia begged her to return immediately, the doctor had been sent for. Poor Deborah's eyes streamed as she put on her bonnet and shawl with trembling hands, and she reproached herself vehemently with having left the child for her own pleasure. As she went sobbing out of the shop-door she found John Wild waiting to escort her home, and though he did not speak a word, the sound of his footsteps beside her comforted her wonder fully. When they got to the house-door Deborah was going hastily in without a word or look at her silent companion, but she suddenly stopped, and holding out her hand to him said, in a choked voice, \" Thank you ; how kind you are to me ! \" She little knew how her words were treasured"], [126, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 112 up and thought upon, during many a long day of waiting and absence, for that was the beginning of John Wild's courtship. He only gave her hand a grip, which would have pained her if she had had time to think about it, and bidding her \" good night,\" walked back to the glover's parlour and finished his supper, wTith a fixed purpose to try his very utmost to win Deborah for his wife. The baby's illness proved to be small-pox, which was then very prevalent, owing to the prejudice which still existed against vaccination. Directly the terrible word was named, both the other servants refused to stay in the house, and left, to Deborah's intense indignation. Herbert had had the disease but Letitia had not, and shut up with her master and mistress and the sick child, for they could find no one willing to run the risk of infection, the faithful and affectionate creature waited upon all three night and day for three weeks, at which time Nelly was out of danger, and her mother gave birth to a dead son. Letitia's enfeebled state was ill-fitted to resist contagion, and a few days after her confinement she, too, sickened with the same disease. Those were what Deborah used to describe as her \" dark days.\" No trouble of her own had ever called forth such an expression from her lips ; but those of her master and mistress were more to her than any that could befall herself, as she nobly proved. She was nearly sinking at last under anxiety"], [127, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 113 and fatigue, when the kind-hearted doctor who attended them noticed her state, and ordered her to go out for a walk every day, charging himself with finding a person who was able and willing to share some of her duties. In this he was suc- cessful, and Deborah, at the end of six weary weeks, found herself once more in the meadows, which were now dappled with buttercups, and fragrant with the perfume of the first cowslips. She walked along at first with one thought, how soon she might go back to her mistress's bedside. The sunshine and the perfumed air oppressed her ; her eyes had been so long accustomed to dark rooms, and her ears to hushed voices, that the intense blue of the sky and the green and gold carpet under her feet dazzled her, and the loud song of a lark irritated her nerves. For almost the first time in her life she felt thoroughly low- spirited, and a longing came over her to cling to some human being for support ; some stronger nature who should help her through this cloudy part of her life which she had come to, by giving her the deep rest of sympathy and fellowship. One of those weak moments had overtaken her when faith in a Higher arm than man's is not lost, but obscured ; and yet all the while she was being tenderly led to the very help she was seeking. She walked on, downcast and anxious, with the shadow of both feelings on her face, and on turn ing to go home John Wild stood before her. \" I saw you in the distance and came to ask 1"], [128, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 114 for news of you all,\" he said, holding out his hand ; and Deborah, weakened by watching, and overcome by the kind tone of interest when she had thought herself bereft and forlorn, burst into tears. It need hardly be said how John Wild's stern face grew transformed at those tears, nor how tender his voice became as he endeavoured to comfort her. Before the walk came to an end, he had made her understand in brief, honest words, that he would be the support and help she had longed for ; and that he wished for nothing better, God helping him, than to be her guide and com forter and husband. Would she give him her love in return ? he asked ; could she trust him ? and Deborah, with a rush of exceeding gladness, answered that she would trust him then and always, all her life long. It may be said that Deborah was rash in form ing such a hasty engagement, and perhaps she was ; but I never heard of any love affair in which a trifle of rashness did not form a component part, and in this instance it was never repented of. No ; although Deborah never married John Wild, and to her strong, loving nature it was a fierce struggle to renounce him, yet she never repented either the honest, pure affection she gave him, nor that which she received from him in return. It gave her the softening touch she wanted, it made her more gentle and sympathizing to others, it purified and ennobled her whole nature. A real true love"], [129, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 115 can never harm either the giver or the receiver of this best gift of God. But then it must be both real and true ; not one of the many spurious counterfeits which usurp its hallowed name. It was no time for Deborah just then to speak of her love. Letitia lay between life and death for many weeks, and Deborah hid away all thoughts of herself deep in her own breast, and threw all the energy of her nature into the tend ing of her dear mistress. Her care, the doctor's skill, and her husband's prayers prevailed. When the summer had fairly set in, she was so far recovered as to be able to bear a removal to her sister's house, for the change which they all so much needed. When they had been there for a short time, during which Letitia's pale cheeks were regaining their roses, and her feeble steps fast becoming strong and elastic, Herbert received a letter from an old friend of his father's, whom he had seen several times during his residence abroad, and from whom he had always received the greatest kindness. This gentleman was a rich merchant residing at Marseilles, and it was at his house that Herbert had fallen ill on his journey home from Paris. He had been much grieved to hear of the turn of affairs at the Hall, and wrote now to propose that Herbert should come out to join him in some com mercial enterprises for which his previous know ledge of mercantile life would peculiarly fit him ;"], [130, "116 MY OWN PEOPLE. and which, if they proved tolerably successful, would replace him in his home and proper posi tion in a much shorter time than he now antici pated. He concluded, after expressing an earnest hope that his offer would be accepted, by giving him a week to consider his answer. When Herbert read the letter to his wife he merely said, \" He does not know of your existence, Lettice ; I could not take a wife and child to France in these troublous times,\" and put the letter away. Letitia watched him carefully for the following few days, and saw that he often lost himself in a reverie, during which his eye would sparkle, and he would clench his hands as if longing to be doing something. He would wake out of such dreamings with a long sigh which went to his wife's heart, and a dull, weary look, as if the con trast between his thoughts, and the reality of his life, oppressed him. All this time he carefully avoided going within sight of the Hall, though he was so near it, and never once named the offer he had received to his sister Ann, nor indeed alluded to it again, even to Letitia. She saw it all. She understood that a life of inactivity was preying upon him, and that he longed in secret for the power of accepting his kind friend's offer ; and she resolved that she would herself give him that power. His wife should never be a hindrance to him ! At the end of the week she went to the little"], [131, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 117 room up-stairs, usually Dorothy's, now given up to him. \" Herbert,\" she asked, \" you are going to answer Mr. Radclyffe's letter this morning ?\" \" Why yes, I think I must.\" \" What answer are you going to send ?\" \" There is only one possible,\" he replied in sur prise. \" No, there are two. You will go, Herbert, will you not ? You will not let me stand in your way ? \" and she knelt down by him in her favourite attitude, and lifted her earnest, entreating face to his. \" My Lettice ! I should be away for five years.\" \" And I will be very happy without you,\" she said, successfully endeavouring to cover, by an assumption of playful sauciness, the tremor in her voice. \"Five years,\" he repeated slowly, half to him self ; \" we could go home again, then,\" and he drew a long breath. \"Yes,\" she said, answering his thought, \"the day of our return will be worth those five years ; and there is Ann to take care of me, and my aunt, and Deborah. Oh ! I am rich in friends ! \" \"My darling wife, this is not a question to be settled lightly. You must understand what it in volves.\" \" I think I do \" It will involve,\" he went on, \" a painful separa tion to both of us ; five years of loneliness for you, for I could not hope, from the nature of the business,"], [132, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 118 to be able to visit England in the interval ; and this loneliness will be increased by the impossibility of letters reaching you with any regularity.\" \" I know and understand it all, Herbert, and now let me dwell upon the advantages of the plan. You will, if successful, get back to our dear home in five years instead of ten. You will, during that time, be employed in a way which suits you, instead of wasting them in enforced idleness ; you will be actually working for your wife and child, which I used to think when I was a girl must be so delight ful. I declare, I shall quite envy you ! \" Her husband bent over the sweet, flushed face, and gave it an earnest kiss, though with only a half comprehension of her entire self-devotion. He felt at the moment as if it would be impossible to part from her, just as she was as it were restored to him from the grave. All his visions and long ings, and eagerness for some active employment, seemed to him just then to sink into insignificance as he looked into the two loving eyes that met his. She saw that he was hesitating, and guessed that the cause of it was herself; so she got up, and disengaging herself from his embrace, re peated, \" You will go, will you not, Herbert, for all our sakes ? \" and went softly away. The letter containing an acceptance of the offer went that afternoon. Deborah had intended telling her mistress of her engagement, now that she was fully recovered \u25a0 but the news of her master's intended departure"], [133, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 119 altered her determination. He had himself an nounced it to her, and had said, \" Deborah, I leave my wife and Nelly in your charge. I could not go but for the knowledge that you would be with them.\" And Deborah, with tears in her eyes, had promised she would never leave them till he came back. She wrote to her betrothed, fully convinced of his entire concurrence with her, and told him what she had done. They were both young, and could wait and hope over the five years. In the meantime, Deborah felt that it would be better not to speak of her own prospects to any one but her uncle. To her simple, faithful mind, it was perfectly natural, and obviously right to do as she had done ; but a delicate instinct made her wish that her master and mistress should not know of her having made any sacrifice for them. So Herbert went, and Letitia, Nelly, and Deborah went back to the small house in Eastfleet. Nothing of any great consequence happened, so far as I have heard, during his absence, except Dorothy's marriage, and Ann's consequent length ened visits to Letitia, with whom indeed she almost took up her abode until Herbert's return. There exists a diary kept by Letitia during that time, which relates more to her private feelings than to outward circumstances, and is very precious to us, as containing many little traits of our mother's early childhood. Mabel may perhaps use part of it for her next chronicle, but it would be out of place for me to quote from it here."], [134, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 120 Herbert came home with all his visions realised. He had visited Monsieur Salterre, who had over whelmed him with gratitude, and was rapidly regaining a position which, if not yet equal to his former one, would still in a very few years enable him to repay his generous nephew with interest. Herbert himself was now justified in returning to his home under brighter auspices than when he first entered it as its possessor. Deborah, too, as may be supposed, looked forward to the day of that happy return, as a day which she hoped would soon be followed by her marriage. Some delay was still needful, caused by the notice required by the family then living at the Hall, and some rather extensive alterations and repairs necessary after so long an absence. Nearly a twelvemonth \u2014 a short sunny twelvemonth \u2014 passed before the final move took place, and during that time, a child \u2014 a boy \u2014 was added to the household. During the last fortnight, Letitia went from house to house, saying grateful words of farewell to the friends, many of them humble ones, who had done so much towards lightening the burden of her solitude. I am lingering over details, because I am loth to come to the conclusion ; but I have undertaken to write it, and must therefore fulfil my task. It \"Was winter when my grandfather and grand mother went back to live in their rightful home. That winter was one of the coldest on record. Many a poor family was half-starved for want of"], [135, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 121 sufficient food and firing, both rendered doubly dear by the war tax ; and there were riots got up by senseless men who fancied their employers could pacify Europe, or change the weather sent by God. Herbert exerted himself to the utmost, that no one on his estate should feel the full bitterness of cold and hunger, and his wife aided him nobly. She was the blessing of the place. You would almost have fancied that the sun shone with more warmth whenever she showed her bright presence ; and certainly men's faces grew softer and less sullen at her approach, and women's tongues were silenced, or spoke only in words of blessing. One day when the earth seemed locked in iron bands, and the sun refused to shine, but had sullenly hidden his face behind grey, brooding clouds, and the ground had a scorched look as if from great heat, Herbert proposed driving his wife some miles to a distant farm where were some poor tenants who might want relieving. He had a new horse which he wanted to try, and said that if Letitia was not afraid of the cold, he would drive her in an open phaeton. Letitia minded nothing ; there was some talk as to whether Nelly should go ; but Deborah objected that the cold was too great for a child, and she accordingly remained at home. Many a time afterwards Deborah thought of her advice then, with fervent thanksgiving. A basket containing comforts of various descriptions was packed, and they started, Letitia well protected from the cold, and smiling a farewell to her children ; the baby"], [136, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 122 boy being held up at the window by Deborah for a last look as they drove away. Three hours, four hours passed without their return, and at the end of that time, when the short day was already declining, a man rode into the stable-yard with a pale face and haggard eyes, and could hardly stammer out to the terrified people his dreadful tidings. The occupants of the farm had been alarmed by the sight of the empty carriage and horses dashing past at a gallop. Two or three of the men had rushed out to stop them, the others had gone along the road, and had there come upon the squire, unhurt himself, kneeling by the road-side with the body of his wife in his arms ; the body \u2014 for alas ! the sweet spirit was not there, though the husband strove in his despair not to believe it. She had been thrown violently upon her head on the hard road, and must have died instantaneously. The horror-stricken people received Herbert's calm orders to go to the Hall for the swiftest horse in the stables, and to ride to the nearest doctor, and left him \u2014 all but one woman, the only female at home. She stayed by the unfortunate man, with streaming tears and many broken attempts at consolation and sympathy, which he neither heard nor heeded. He was immovable as a stone \u2014 mute as the sullen sky that bent over the little group like a pall. At last the doctor came, and Herbert, with one long, shivering sigh, gave up the precious"], [137, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 123 burden to him, hardly seemed to hear his mournful words as he pronounced the fatal truth, and suf fered himself to be led from the spot in a lethargy from which it appeared impossible to arouse him. It lasted, that dumb despair, till the Hall was reached, and even when the light of the oil-lamp over the door fell directly upon the pale face and senseless form which was carried across the threshold, he did not tremble or shudder, but fol lowed, mute, bowed down and stony. \" Let him see his children,\" whispered the doctor to one of the sobbing servants. In a few minutes Deborah was in the room where her mistress lay ; Nelly clinging half-frightened to her gown, the baby caught up from his sleep, with rosy face and half shut eyes, and Deborah herself with the paleness of an anguish that had not as yet found relief in tears. Nelly ran to her father on first catching sight of him, but suddenly retreated when she saw his face. He tried to call her back, but his voice failed him. Deborah, for the only time in her life, as she told me, spoke angrily to the motherless child ; and Nelly, bewildered and frightened, went again to him, clasped her little arms round his neck, and burst into sobs. The child's grief, all unconscious as it was, roused him. He bent his head over hers, and trembled and moaned with the vain effort to find the same childish outlet for his sorrow. The baby began to wail, and Deborah, giving it in charge to the nurse-girl, threw herself on the bed beside her dead mistress in an agony of"], [138, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 124 grief. Then and there she vowed never, never to leave those motherless ones ; and when, after she had assisted to perform the last sad duties, she was left alone in the solemn room, she knelt down by the bed, and registered the vow before God. In the excitement of her feelings it was easy to make such a vow, but there came a time when it cost her a severe struggle to keep to it. When the funeral was over, and the sad house once more opened to the light of the sun, and everything went on as usual, as people say who have never known what it is to feel that there is a great blank in their daily lives which no one on earth can ever fill again, it became necessary that Deborah should write to John Wild ; and over that letter and that resolve there was fought as hard a battle, and gained as triumphant a victory, as ever was chronicled in the history of kings and con querors. The words she used in telling me of it were at once so natural and so pathetic, so un conscious and yet so nearly sublime in their sim plicity, that I have no hesitation in writing them down as far as I can remember them. \" The children were in bed and asleep, and I sat with my paper before me, but I had not thought my task would have been so difficult. On a sudden, it all came back to me \u2014 the common, the blue sky, the very smell of the cowslips, and the figure of John Wild, his gentle, manly face, and the voice in which he told me that he loved me. My thoughts stopped there. I put my hands over"], [139, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 125 my ears, fancying that by so doing I could shut out that voice, and the remembrance of the words which I now knew had been my constant joy and help for five years. I could not give him up. I began to say to myself that it was wrong in me to have made the vow I did, because of him. \" Indeed, Miss Janet, that was a great trouble to me. I could not feel sure that I had any right to sacrifice him as well as myself, and yet \u2014 there was my vow. I was in a sore strait, and I thought of Hannah, and got the Bible to see if I could learn anything that would apply to myself in the story. I saw there that Hannah kept her vow, which must no doubt have been very terrible to her, but then there was no one else concerned in the matter, at least, the Bible did not tell me that her husband disapproved. I put the book back, and began to walk restlessly about, and stopped at last by Miss Nelly's bedside. My hasty move ments had disturbed her. She opened her eyes and held out her dear little arms when she saw me, and cried to be taken up, which was a thing she never did before. I took her in my arms to the fire, and sat a good long time with her cheek nestled against mine till she went off to sleep again ; then I laid her down in her cot, the sweet lamb, and returned to my letter. It was easier now. The soft touch of the child's face and the clinging of her arms had strengthened me. The thought came upon me to pray to be directed rightly in my ignorance and trouble, and the"], [140, "MY 0 WN PEOPLE. 126 answer came. I wrote to John to help me. I told him that I was tossed with doubt as to how he would take what I had done. I begged him to decide for me, for I trusted in him entirely. I asked him what he would think right in my case, and to help me to do it ; and when I had finished the letter, I laid down to sleep between my children, with a feeling of peace I had not en joyed for some days. I waited very anxiously, as you 'may suppose, for the reply, and was weak enough sometimes to hope that John would see things in a different light to what I did, and show me that it was my duty to keep my promise to him. Well, the letter came at last, and such a letter as made me love him more than ever, and yet settled my resolution to part from him. He began by saying that I had set him an example of unselfish ness which he would try to follow. That was not true, for I had, as you know, been very weak and selfish through it all, but you see he loved me. He went straight to the point, as I knew he would, and said that I was right in keeping my vow, and right in asking him to help me to keep it ; that he should scorn himself if he were to make it more difficult than it was, though he was glad to know that it was difficult to me. Then followed some words which I kept in my heart and repeated whenever I said my prayers for many a long year, and then he bade God bless me for this life and the next. \" I cried passionately over the letter, with a mix-"], [141, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 127 ture of pain, joy, and pride. I think I was even angry and hurt for one minute \u2014 I was a poor, weak creature, not at all strong or brave, as John thought me \u2014 but that did not last. I thanked God that the decision was made, and I thank Him now that I have never had occasion to repent of it.\""], [142, "V THERE is one incident in our grandmother's diary which I have cried over many a time, and as I knew no more about the parties con cerned than the veriest stranger, I think it may go down in my \"book,\" and interest any one who happens to read it as much as it has interested me. The episode in question does not relate to any one of the family, it is true, but as grand mamma was, after all, a good deal concerned in it, Janet thinks I may call it a chronicle. Mabel. July, 1805, Eastjieet. \u2014 My first day of solitude. Baby and I must comfort one another as best we can \u2014 my blessing, who looks at me out of Her bert's eyes ! My chief occupation must now be to train her up to be all that he would wish to see her when he comes home.

I pity women who have"], [143, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 129 no children to love and think for. What should I do without my Nelly now ? 10X \u2014 I have had a visitor to-day. As I stood at my window, watching the shadows flying over the meadows, and making up my mind to go and take a walk instead of sitting down to think, the garden-gate opened, and there came up the path a little lady, very erect and vigorous in her move ments, carrying an ebony cane, with which she tapped at the garden-door. I knew that none of the servants would hear that tap, so I ran down and opened the door myself, and encountered the quaintest figure, and withal the pleasantest face and the brightest eyes imaginable. \" How do you do, my dear ? \" she said, holding out her hand as if she had known me all her life, and speaking in a sweet, cheerful voice, which quite inclined my heart to her. \"I thought you would be feeling dull just now, and so I came to look in upon you, as I know your little girl so well.\" I thanked her, and made her come in, and then I remembered that Deborah had told me of an old lady she met with constantly in her walks, who always spoke to Nelly. When she was settled upon the sofa, she went on, \" I have a little girl, just the age of yours.\" \"A little grand-daughter, I presume,\" said I, glancing at her face, which, though fresh with a wintry bloom, bore unmistakable tokens of age. \"Oh, no! a child,\" she said ; \"a daughter. She left me, I can't tell how long ago, for I never can K"], [144, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 130 remember dates ; sometimes it seems a long while, but that cannot be, you know, and I expect her back every day. She may be at home when I get back,\" and the old lady smiled, a glad, contented smile, at the possibility. I was too startled to speak, but I rang the bell and sent for Nelly, and tried not to be frightened at being alone in the same room with a mad person \u2014 for mad she un doubtedly must be. She kissed and fondled my child, sometimes calling her \"Hattie,\" which I take to be the name of her lost little one. As she took leave she said, \"When my Hattie comes home, she will be such a nice companion for your child. She may be there now. I must make haste ! \" and she trotted off, her face radiant with expectation. Poor thing ! poor thing ! Wednesday. \u2014 I have heard about my old lady. It is a mournful history. Her child was kid napped, it is supposed, by gipsies, when she was quite a young woman, and her poor brain became turned in consequence. She is quite harmless, and overflowing with love for all children, who are associated in her mind with her own happy days. Her husband has been long dead, and if she has relations they do not ever come near her, for she lives alone in one of the Terrace houses, as they are called ; they are built outside the town, and are shadowed by trees which are planted in lines, something after the fashion of a boulevard."], [145, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 131 These weary, hot days and nights ! I begin to wish summer was over. I could not sleep last night, and about ten o'clock got softly up and went to Nelly's little bed, which stands at the foot of my own. She was sleeping quietly. One hand had pushed aside the quilt from her shoulders, the other was clenched among her tangled curls. She is two years old, and has as yet given no signs of even the ordinary faults, outbreaks of wilfulness and the like, which one expects in a child. She has a sweet, quiet, trusting disposition, which God grant may stay with her, to help her over the rough places she will have to encounter in life. I do not wish to be a partial mother; I think there is nothing so pitiable as to be blind to the faults of one's children ; so I will leave off writing about Nelly, and watch for the first dawnings of evil, that I may check them as wisely and gently as I can. Saint Monica has always appeared to me to be the pattern for mothers, and I thought of her and of her child of many prayers, as I watched last night over my darling, my trust that I have to keep for Herbert. Oh for grace to guide her and myself aright ! I pray for it each night and morn ing, and many times in the day besides. Eastfleet is not interesting, though I am doing my best to believe that it is. The one, long, narrow High Street stifles me when I walk along it ; the hot pavement burns my feet, and the rattle of coaches and carts makes my head ache. And"], [146, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 132 then I have no concern with the people, and the people have none with me. Herbert and I have made but few acquaintances, and I have no heart to cultivate even those few. They seem to belong to a different world to mine, and I watch them coming and going like actors in a play-house, while I sit apart and am only a spectator. The church stands on the Market Hill, and when I get into the cool shadow of its old, black walls, I feel as if I should be quite content to stay there and rest till Herbert comes back \u2014 rest, and let the outside world roll on with its roar and bustle like a weary dream. When I was a child, St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey did not produce half the impression on me that the old church at Chelsea did ; and though Eastfleet Church contains nothing half so interesting as the latter, yet the very atmosphere, which has a musty, unused smell, the worn baize lining of the pews, and the droning voices of the men and boys in the singing-gallery, are already dear to me, and carry me back to the dim, half-forgotten days of my earliest childhood. Last Sunday, I am ashamed to say, I heard not one word of the sermon, but was absorbed in a dream of certain Sundays when I went with my aunt to church, and sat in one corner of the well cushioned pew, close to Sir Thomas More's monu ment, and used to count the little squares of light that fell upon the pavement from a window near; watching their gradual disappearance, one by one, with a kind of fascination, as I learnt to know"], [147, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 133 exactly the moment at which the sermon would end by calculating how many patches had yet to be extinguished. I found myself looking for the gleams of lozenge-shaped light yesterday, but there were none to be seen, and, instead, a faint streak or two of orange and blue, from an old stained window, fell upon a raised stone in the uneven pavement, which bore initials and a date. I fell to wondering who A. L. D., 1760, could have been, a man or a woman, and what sort of a life had worn itself out and taken leave of the body, laid to rest there under the stones. July ibfh. \u2014 To-day I took Nelly to see the poor, mad old lady, Mrs. Patty Ringrove, or Mrs. Patty as she is always called. I found her seated in a cool little parlour, the floor of which was covered with matting instead of carpet. Everything was nice and ladylike about her and the room, but on the mantelshelf, instead of ornaments, were ranged little articles of child's attire or use ; a feeding- bottle in the centre, a little morocco shoe on either side, placed up against the wall, a coral and bells, and a picture-book. I can't say how the sight of these things affected me. To think of the years that had passed since they had been in use, of the deep woe which had unsettled the reason of the poor mother, and of the dreadful mystery which must always shroud the fate of the little innocent one ! My eyes were quite blinded with"], [148, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 134 tears, as I looked first at the mantelshelf, and then at the placid, smiling face of Mrs. Patty. \"Ah, my dear,\" she said, \"you are looking at mv Hattie's things. I have them always ready, you see, in case she comes back suddenly.\" She got up from her seat, and, going to the mantelshelf, took up one of the little red morocco shoes, and, with a silk handkerchief which lay near, began to wipe the dust from the precious relic, fondling it the while, and speaking to it in the cooing voice which mothers use when talking to their babies. A sob came from me quite unawares ; I could not help it. Mrs. Patty looked round, and replacing the shoe came up to me. The placid expression of her face was gone, and in its place an unsettled, unsteady look came and went over her features, and her eyes were wild and mournful. \" You are sorry for me,\" she said, in a changed voice ; \" you have reason. Oh, my God ! the void here ! \" she struck her hand on her breast, \"the cold, icy, aching void ! \" A quiet rain of tears followed, during which I signed to Deborah to take Nelly away ; and holding her hands in my own tried to soothe her by all the comforting words I could muster. While thus engaged, a short, prim female entered the room, with hard, pinched face, and lips so much compressed that she seemed scarcely able to open them sufficiently for the purposes of speech. At the sight of her, poor Mrs. Patty became instantly and strangely transformed. She"], [149, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 135 disengaged her trembling hands from mine, dried her eyes, and before the prim female had had time to do more than say to me, in a tone of stern reproof, \"Mrs. Patty is always the worse for sympathy; it unsettles her as you see,\" her face wore once more the smiling, vacant look which had been so suddenly disturbed. I felt guilty of having troubled that merciful peace by my unlucky sob, but I resented the reproof administered by such sour-looking lips, and I have a strong, painful suspicion that my poor Mrs. Patty is kept in a thraldom which helps to foster her delusion by frightening her from using her sealed-up faculties. Sealed up I believe they are, not lost, else why that pitiful exclamation, those suddenly mournful eyes, and that rain of tears ? I will find out more about it, and know more too of the prim elderly female, whom I take to be half servant, wholly keeper, and who, I am sure, exercises her rule too tyrannously. August i si, Sunday. \u2014 I walked to church this morning, and felt the beauty and strong comfort of our Liturgy as I never felt it before. People may be tempted to be led away from it when they are in such idle prosperity as to want the excite ment of change, but when sobered or tried by sorrow, separation from those they love, or any real misfortune, they do well to come back to the Church's old-fashioned prayers for comfort. I let Deborah go in the afternoon, and stayed myself with Nelly. She was quite contented to"], [150, "136 MY OWN PEOPLE. sit on the floor, and talk gravely to the pictures in the curious old Dutch Bible as I slowly turned over the leaves for her, till such time as I sent her out with one of the other servants for her after noon walk. Then I sat with my Bible, aunt's wedding-gift, on my lap, and let my thoughts travel. I was always too happy in the present to feel this a luxury until now. They wandered too long however, for I was suddenly surprised by a tear falling on my book. After my prayers this morning, and my many resolutions of courage and patience, I felt ashamed of my down-heartedness, but I could not help it. Tear followed after tear, till I was fain to put away the book for fear the pages should be blistered. Deborah came in from church and found me crying. She was always as true as steel, but I think she has grown less abrupt and more sympathetic in manner of late, and I value tenderness and sympathy now more than I can say. She did not tell me that I ought to be cheerful, but she talked cheerfully herself, and at last said something about Ann coming to pay me a visit with Dorothy. Oh, how pleasant that would be ! I could almost feel light-hearted at the thought. I will think about writing to ask them to-morrow. Monday. \u2014 I have a letter from Ann. She will come here by the end of the week, leaving Dorothy with a friend, a certain Mrs. Dugdale, who lives near, and who entertains a strong affection for Dolly. It seems that my good Deborah had taken"], [151, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 137 it on herself to write to Ann some days ago, with out telling me. I do indeed want companionship, and I am glad Ann is coming, and yet I could have found it in my heart to scold Deborah. She is mistaken if she thinks that any one can make up to me for my husband, or that even Ann can do more than make the time pass a little less heavily while he is away. Friday. \u2014 Ann arrived this afternoon, and has brought me a piece of news which has surprised me not a little. Dorothy is promised in marriage to a son of old Mrs. Dugdale. He has been serv ing with the army, and, being slightly wounded, came home to be nursed, and lost his heart to Dolly during the process. Ann says he is a fine, manly youth, and such a good son to his mother that he is sure to make a good husband. She has written to Herbert for his consent and approval, which he will give I know, for he has known and honoured the Dugdale family all his life ; so Dorothy will be a soldier's wife. Alas ! these are not times in which to envy such a lot, and I fear, and Ann fears, that our merry, high-spirited Dolly has much anxiety in store for her. But I suspect she would rather have the suffering with the love to soften it, than forego both ; and what woman will say she is wrong ? Not I for one ; and painful separations are not only reserved for soldiers' wives, so Dolly may perhaps be as well off as many another. God send her and young Willie Dugdale every happiness !"], [152, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 138 August 14. \u2014 A long walk and talk with Ann. She says I must make interests here, or I shall grow selfish and complaining. I am sadly afraid, on looking back at my diary, that I have become so already. I love Ann dearly because she always tells me truth. She says I have no business to shut myself up, and think only of my own sorrows, while there are so many heavier ones borne by others round me. That is sadly true ; witness poor Mrs. Patty. I told Ann her story, and pro mised to take her to see her to-morrow. November. \u2014 I would not write in my diary any more until I could write more cheerfully, so three whole months have gone by since I turned over its leaves ; months which have left me so many mercies that I should be the most ungrateful of human beings were I not to record here my deep and grateful sense of them. In the first place I have heard from my husband, and he is well and cheerful, and likely to prosper in his undertaking. Nelly grows in beauty and intelligence every day, and the quaint thoughtful ness of her remarks is a constant source of amuse ment and interest to me. The unfolding of a child's mind is a lovely thing to see ! Ann stayed with me for six weeks, and during her stay I gained many an object of interest in my neigh bours, both rich and poor, who before she came I had visited but little, and that only from a feeling of necessity. Now I see that my happiness, as"], [153, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 139 well as my duty, lies in cultivating my neigh bours as far as I can, and in endeavouring to participate in their joys and sorrows. Besides, there is the plain Bible command for it, \" Bear ye one another's burdens,\" though I had forgotten it in my selfishness. I have discovered a romance, nay \u2014 a far more real thing\u2014 a tragedy, to make the heart beat and the eyes fill, in dull, matter-of-fact Eastfleet. I left off my diary by saying that I was going to take Ann to see Mrs. Patty the. next day. We went accordingly, and were ushered into the house by the woman I have before mentioned, and whose name is Martha. She opened the drawing-room door, and then, to my surprise and anger, came in herself, and shutting it stood there in the attitude of a sentinel. I suppose I looked what I felt, for she proceeded to say between her closed lips, with an aggravating little cough after each sentence, that my presence had so disturbed Mrs. Patty before, and the agitation caused by my words had so broken her rest, that she considered it her duty to remain in the room to look after her patient. She had no doubt I had erred from want of know ledge, and so on. All this was sufficiently pro voking, and it was on my tongue to make a sharp answer, when Ann laid her hand gently on my arm, and looked at Mrs. Patty, whom I had almost forgotten in my annoyance. She was gazing, first at me and then at Martha, with a helpless, puzzled expression which was so* pitiful that I instantly"], [154, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 140 felt self-convicted, and determined to endure any impertinence rather than trouble the poor, weak mind from any petty feeling of pride or anger. I went up to her and said I had brought my sister to see her. \" Thank you, my dear,\" she said, holding out her hand to Ann with a smile, and then looking at me, she whispered : \" Has she any children ? any little girls ? Tell her, if she has, to be very careful of them. They might stray away, you know, and instead of coming back as my Hattie will, she might never see them again. I think she looks as if she had seen sorrow, though she has such a calm face now. Will you sit by me, my dear ? \" Ann sat down on the sofa, and I remained standing where I could observe both Mrs. Patty's countenance and Martha's ; but I did not gain much by my espionage. Martha looked immov able, more like a wooden figure than a woman, as she stood at the door hardly winking her eyes ; and yet I felt that, in some inscrutable way, she was watching me intently. Mrs. Patty prattled on to Ann very sensibly and pertinently on most subjects, only giving evidence of her weakness when anything put her in mind of children : then she would speak of her Hattie's probable return, of the joy it would be to her, and of the little girl's infantine beauty and attractions, with a perfect forgetfulness of the lapse of time, and with smiles which were to me far sadder than tears. She did not seem conscious of Martha's presence except"], [155, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 141 once when the latter coughed, and then I fancied that Mrs. Patty glanced at her apprehensively and was suddenly silent. When we took our leave I mentioned my suspicions to Ann, but she had not seen anything to justify them, and thought me fanciful. I tried to think so too, but did not succeed. The next day I had a visit from Mrs. Danny, the lawyer's wife. I had never liked her so little. She has always been oppressively obsequious in her manner, but to-day it grated upon me more than usual; and when I mentioned Mrs. Patty she smiled, and said she was a poor, crazy thing that ought to be in Bedlam, and then saw by my face that she was on the wrong tack, and began to talk compassionately till I could have boxed her ears. I sat hardly listening to her conversation with Ann, until all at once my attention was arrested by hearing her mention the name of Bristowe. It was some little time before I could remember what made the name so familiar to me, and when I did so, I asked eagerly whether the Mistress Bristowe she meant lived in that county, and what she had to do with Mrs. Patty. \" She is her sister,\" was the answer. \" Her sister ! And yet she lets her be taken care of by a servant who tyrannizes over her ! \" I exclaimed incautiously. \" Tyrannizes ! \" repeated Mrs. Danny, \" Martha tyrannize ! I think you must be mistaken, my"], [156, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 142 dear madam. She is a highly superior person, so sensible \u2014 surely \" Here Ann interposed. \" I dare say she is all that, we have no means of judging; but does Mistress Bristowe never come to visit Mrs. Patty?\" \" Oh dear no ! \" bridled Mrs. Danny, \" she could not do so with any propriety under the circum stances ; in fact, I believe they have never met since Mrs. Patty's unfortunate affair. Her sister was so much younger \u2014 quite a child when it happened.\" \" What happened ? \" I asked impatiently. \" Dear me ! do you not know ?\" and Mrs. Danny complacently settled her shawl with all the de lightful self-consciousness of possessing more in formation on an interesting subject than any one present. \"Mrs. Patty eloped when she was five and-twenty, and her sister only fifteen, with a Captain Ringrove, and it was not known that she was ever really married. Her father believed not, and he had of course means of finding out, though some people called him hard at the time. He cast her off, and when she came home a year after wards with her child, and a pitiful story of her husband's desertion, he refused to take her in, and she found shelter with some good-natured, not over particular relations who believed her story. It was while at their house that her little girl was stolen, by gipsies as was always supposed, though the father was for a little time suspected ; but this was afterwards disproved.\" He was shot in a duel with the present Sir George soon afterwards."], [157, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 143 \" And her father never saw her again ? \" I ex claimed indignantly. \"What right had he to doubt her word ?\" \"He had another daughter,\" said Mrs. Danny, \" and you know, for her sake, he was obliged to be particular.\" \" And so for the sake of one daughter, he left the other to madness and a broken heart ! \" \" She had brought it on herself by her miscon duct. Her father, the old Sir George, died broken hearted not very long afterwards, and her brother, a most gentlemanly man \u2014 I had the pleasure of paying a visit to him with my husband at his fine place, last summer, not many miles from here \" \" Her brother ? \" I interrupted. \" Her brother, Sir George Bristowe, most gene rously allows her three hundred pounds per annum, and was himself at the pains to choose the atten dant, Martha, who has now the charge of her.\" \" Good God ! \" I said, \" what cruel tender mer cies ! It seems to me that her brother and sister have been taught to look upon her as an outcast, and that her husband and father have to answer for her blighted life. Where did you learn this terrible history ? \" \" From the lips of Sir George's own house keeper ; and surely\u2014 Miss Stirling, I appeal to you,\" and Mrs. Danny rose with a look of virtuous indig nation on her face, \" a woman whose marriage is doubtful, and whose husband, if husband he be,"], [158, "i44 MY OWN PEOPLE. has deserted her, is not to be treated exactly as if she had always conducted herself properly.\" \"If your husband deserted you, then, Mrs. Danny, that would be a reason for your friends to desert you too. It seems to me that you would want them more instead of less.\" \" My husband ! \" said Mrs. Danny. \" Really, Mrs. Stirling \" \" I was only putting a case,\" I said. \" But why was her marriage doubtful ? There were registers in those days, and if any trouble had been taken, the fact might have been ascertained. I pity Mrs. Patty from the bottom of my heart.\" \" So do I, I am sure ; and it is so kind of you to feel as you do for her ! \" said Mrs. Danny, rising to take leave with a perplexed face, which amused me in spite of my indignation. \" Of course, Sir George's housekeeper told me all this as a secret. She would not wish it repeated. Mistress Bris towe never mentioned her sister to me. Good-bye. Most kind of you, I am sure.\" Directly Mrs. Danny was gone, a most unrea sonable desire came upon me to write to Mistress Bristowe, and acquaint her with her sister's state ; and though I felt immediately that to do so would look like an unwarrantable and impertinent inter ference in a private family matter, my heart was not satisfied, though my reason assented. When Nelly came to me to kiss papa's picture, which she does every night before going to bed, I took her in my arms and cried. Deborah thought I was fret-"], [159, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 145 ting for Herbert ; but my tears were in reality caused by the painful sympathy I felt for my poor Mrs. Patty, and my longing to do something for her. \" Oh ! is it possible,\" I thought, \" that poor heart once beat as warmly and throbbed as ten derly over a child as mine does over my Nelly ? and now \" I stopped myself here ; for I was sorely tempted to question the decrees of Provi dence. I took Ann for a walk the next day, and then she asked me if I knew any of the poor people in Eastfleet. I was ashamed to have to say that I did not ; and just as I was blushing over my confession, and feeling that I had lived to myself too long, we passed the door of a house out of which came the old vicar, Dr. Roberts. He stopped to speak to me, and I requested him to name any deserving people whom I might visit. He looked keenly at me, and said, with a benevolent smile \u2014 \" My dear madam, they are all deserving people in my parish.\" I began to say that I was glad, but surprised to hear it ; but Ann caught his meaning. \"Deserving of all that one fellow-creature can do for another,\" she said quietly. The doctor turned to her with a pleased bow, and then again to me. \" I beg your pardon,\" he said courteously, \" for being so rude as to make an ambiguous answer to a plain question.\" \" It was my want of I an- L"], [160, "146 MY OWN PEOPLE. swered, smiling too. \" But now that we do under stand one another, will you grant my request ? \" \" Certainly. Go into any one of those houses,\" pointing to a row of almshouses near, \" and there you will find much to interest both your mind and heart and to excite your sympathy. A weekly visit from a lady they often talk about will be a treat to the poor old souls.\" \" They talk about me ! \" I exclaimed. \"Indeed they do, especially one disabled woman whose husband is away from her, at sea.\" The vicar was here accosted by some one, and took his leave, and I was glad he did, for his last words had filled my eyes with tears. I went to one or two of the alms-women the fol lowing week, when one of my fits of yearning for the sight of Herbert had depressed me more than usual, and came away with my heart strangely lightened. They had each their little tale to tell of sorrow, illness, and poverty, and I was walking up the street, my head full of plans for the increased comfort of the sailor's wife, when I heard a voice that made me look up, and came face to face with Mistress Bristowe. In an instant Mrs. Patty took the place of the poor alms-woman in my head, and I resolved to do battle for her. It was so wonderful a thing that I should come across her now, when I had such an interest in seeing her, and so much might be involved in the meeting ! For I was determined not to let the matter rest. Common humanity was at stake."], [161, "MY OWN PEOPLE. i47 Here was a lady in utter ignorance of the state, perhaps of the very existence, of her sister. That sister was, I believed, kept under a restraint as needless as it was cruel, and when a little human love might effect untold good upon her poor heart, which seemed even now to beat with kindlier sym pathies than more favoured beings could boast of possessing. I felt strong to risk anything, if I could but bring some good to the weary, waiting, distracted soul. And I knew what I was risking : the anger of her brother, the possible scorn and indignation of Mistress Bristowe herself, of whose heart I had no reason to think particularly well when I remembered Sophy, and the possible dis approval of my husband if I found myself mis taken. But I would not hesitate. My aunt had often said to me, \" Letty, if you are in doubt about the right or the wrong of a thing you are going to do, if you can pray to God about it, you are safe.\" I applied this test now, and found that I was safe. Besides, was it not a dispensation of Providence that Mistress Bristowe should have been thrown in my way at this particular juncture ? All this, of course, passed through my mind in a very short space of time, while I made myself known to Mistress Bristowe, and asked her to come home with me ; and as she readily con sented, I brought my mind back with some diffi culty to other things, and asked after Miss Sophy as we walked along. \" Don't talk of the ungrateful minx,\" was the"], [162, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 148 petulant reply. \"She has left me \u2014 married, if you will believe it, just when I was most counting upon her services, with the winter coming on, and all my dresses to see to \u2014 married a poor man, who will hardly give her bread to eat. Well, she de serves it for her ingratitude.\" \" I am very sorry,\" I said ; \" for it sounds a bad prospect for her, and she did not look strong enough to cope with poverty. Poverty is an ugly thing.\" \" I am not sorry,\" said Mistress Bristowe sharply. \" Let her find out the difference between my house and table, and all the comforts she enjoyed with me, and the shabbiness and pinch ing she will have to encounter. She actually told me when she left that she hoped to be far happier with the man of her choice than with me. The man of her choice, indeed ! The man of her fiddle-stick ! A poor, half-starved curate ! But the silly fool's head was always full of love and nonsense.\" \" Ah, but, Mistress Bristowe,\" I said, \" most young girls' heads are, once in their lives. You must not talk against that to me.\" \" You married the young man in the snow,\" she said, looking at me suddenly. \" I knew you would ; and there is no need to blush for it now ; the thing is done.\" \" And if Sophy has as little need to wish the same thing undone as I have, she will be a happy woman, and you have no cause to pity her,\" said I, as I opened the door of my house,"], [163, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 149 feeling this to be a sorry commencement to my purpose. I had a deep-laid plan in my head ; for I meant after dinner, which she had promised to stay and partake of, to tell her that I was going that after noon to see Mrs. Patty, concealing her other name. Then I meant to relate as much as I knew of her previous history and present condition, and so find out if her sister were really in ignorance of the sad circumstances. I communicated my plan to Ann in a few pri vate words. She approved, and we all sat down to dinner. It was some time before I could get the conver- sation round naturally to the point I wished ; but presently Mistress Bristowe asked a leading ques- tion. How did I amuse myself at Eastfleet ? Had I pleasant neighbours ? Thereupon I spoke, and said that I was going to see one in whom I was much interested. Questions followed, which I was, of course, only too glad to answer. I described poor Mrs. Patty and Martha, and the thraldrom in which I suspected she was kept, and then, having succeeded in producing a look of interest and indignation in Mistress Bristowe's face, and feel- ing very much as if I were acting the part of the prophet Nathan, I proceeded to narrate what I had heard about the poor lady's secret marriage, the birth of her child, its loss, and so on, keeping my eye fixed on my hearer's countenance. But her features never moved, nor did her colour"], [164, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 150 change. She had never heard my version of the story, I was quite sure. I was thankful to feel convinced of this, or I should hardly have had patience to speak politely to her, nor to ask her, as I now did, if she would accompany me to see Mrs. Patty, without betraying my feelings. After some little demur, which set me trembling with anxiety, she consented, and as we all walked out together, Mistress Bristowe turned to me and said \u2014 \" You have not told me the name of this unfor tunate lady.\" I was thankful to be able to reply that she was never called anything but \"Mrs. Patty.\" \" Patty ? \" repeated Mistress Bristowe ; \" that is singular ;\" and there was a pause during which I heard my heart beat. \" What had that name recalled ? \" I thought ; \" a dead sister or a dishonoured one ? I wish I could see her face : I think I could tell from that.\" But I could not accomplish my wish, and walked on in silence which was unbroken till we reached Mrs. Patty's house. The door was opened, as usual, by Martha, who betrayed surprise, or uneasiness, or both, by an involuntary nervous movement of the unwinking eyelids, when she saw our companion. I was sure of it ! She told us her mistress was poorly, and asked us to wait in the passage while she went to see if she felt disposed to admit us. As we stood there I exchanged glances with Ann, who had also"], [165, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 151 remarked Martha's momentary change of counte nance, and Mistress Bristowe whispered to me \u2014 \" Where can I have seen that woman's face ? As forbidding an expression as I ever saw ! \" After waiting for about a minute, Martha re turned to say that poor Mrs. Patty was too unwell to see any one. The door was opened, and we were out on the Terrace again, my pet scheme shivered to atoms. I was very much annoyed, and even Ann re marked that the circumstance of Mrs. Patty's ill ness was suspicious, and that Martha was evidently unwilling to admit us, \" although that may be,\" she added, \" because she is really afraid of excite ment for her charge.\" I asked Mistress Bristowe eagerly where she had seen Martha's face ; but she could not tell me, though her brow was knitted painfully all the way back to my house with the vain effort to recall some early recollection with which she declared Mrs. Patty's attendant was inseparably connected. All teatime she remained grave and distracted, and when at six o'clock her man-servant and chaise arrived at the door, she promised of her own accord to pay me another visit before long, and enjoined me quite eagerly to let her know if I found out anything about Mrs. Patty. \" Ann,\" I cried triumphantly, directly the door had closed, \" I see it, I know it all ! \" \" Well, what is it, my dear ? All what ? \" \" Why, all there is to know about Mrs. Patty"], [166, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 152 and Mistress Bristowe and Martha. Mistress Bristowe has been kept in ignorance of her sis ter's fate. Most likely she thinks her dead, if she remembers anything of her at all. I am so glad ! I need not hate her now. But what a heartless villain her brother must be ! \" Ann laid her hand over my impetuous lips. \" Perhaps he, too, knows as little as his sister,\" she said. \" No, no ; he makes her an allowance. Don't you remember Mrs. Danny said so ? I dare say he thinks her both mad and wicked ; but how dare he, how dare any one, take such things on trust ? My poor Mrs. Patty ! It is as clear as daylight. Martha must have been seen by Mistress Bristowe at some distant time. She was an old servant of the family, perhaps, and it is her interest to pre serve her situation with Mrs. Patty ; she is no doubt paid handsomely. She started when she saw Mistress Bristowe ; you saw it yourself. She was afraid of the power of old associations over Mrs. Patty's mind. I should not wonder if seeing her sister would bring back her senses. Oh ! how shall we manage it ? \" \" My dear Lettice, you have made up quite a romance. Some of it seems likely to be true, I own; but pray don't jump to conclusions all at once ; and, above all, let a doctor be consulted before you venture to try experiments upon poor Mrs. Patty's mind.\" I was too eager to be sensible, and almost re-"], [167, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 153 sen ted Ann's calm speech ; but a few minutes' reflection made me agree with her. I must wait patiently till I saw Mistress Bristowe again. In the meantime I would tell as much of the case as I could, without mentioning names, to my kind doctor, and ask him if he thought there would be any danger in endeavouring to recall old scenes and memories to a mind in the state of poor Mrs. Patty's. As Ann and I stood together over Nelly's cot that night, I whispered : \" I have forgotten the poor alms-woman till this minute ! To-day has been the very shortest day I have had since Her bert went.\" \" And to-morrow shall be as short,\" said Ann, putting her kind arm round me. \"We will get ready some things for her, and you promised to write to her husband ; and there is that new work to prepare for Mrs. Patty. We have a great deal to do. Ah, Letty dear, there is nothing like working for others for keeping one's own heart contented.\" \" I should never have found that out but for you,\" I said. \" You would have learnt it for yourself sooner or later,\" she replied, as she wished me good-night. A fortnight passed before I heard from Mistress Bristowe. During that interval I had seen Mrs. Patty twice, and my suspicions were so far con firmed that she denied having been ill, and re proached me with not coming to see her so often"], [168, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 154 as I used to do. She evidently knew nothing of my former visit. I could not but notice, too, that she no longer walked out alone as she had done when I first knew her. I suspected that Martha did not wish her to see too much of me, and when I once ventured to say something on the subject, the poor lady said, with the helpless expression which always pained me so, \" My dear, I should like it, but Martha says I am not strong enough ; and I suppose she knows best,\" and I had to gulp down my indignation as I best could, for fear of disturbing her patient serenity, as I had done once before. I also con sulted my doctor. He told me that when the patient was ordinarily calm and cheerful, and the case was simply one of delusion and not mania, most beneficial results had been known to follow from a judicious revival of old recollections, when those recollections were pleasant ones. This proviso rather staggered me, for I had no means of knowing whether the early days of her girlhood, before her disastrous marriage, had been happy or not. I judged the former. If not, her face would hardly have taken now the placid, sweet look which seemed to me to be its normal expression ; so, after anxious consultation with Ann over a letter from Mistress Bristowe, announcing her arrival on the following day, we determined that the experiment might safely be tried. To ensure our success this time, we went to call on Mrs. Patty the day before, and asked her, in"], [169, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 155 Martha's presence, if we might bring a friend to see her on the morrow. She consented readily : began to say that she would come to see us, but stopped short in her sentence at a glance from Martha, and said confusedly, it would be better if we came \u2014 she should be very glad to see any friend we might like to bring \u2014 she saw very few people. \"What shall we do if she is taken ill again to-morrow ? \" asked Ann, as we came away. \" Confront Martha,\" I said, with a sudden access of courage, \" and tell her boldly she is not speak ing the truth. But I think she will let us in. She will begin to imagine we suspect her unless she does, and she is too wary to overreach herself.\" Mistress Bristowe arrived duly the next day. She was so quiet that I began to think she was unwell, until I remembered that agitation often took the shape of extreme outward stillness, with fidgety people ; though what was the exact cause of her agitation, I could not then tell. Her first question related to Mrs. Patty. She feared, she said, that I had discovered nothing about her, or I should have written as I promised. \"Nothing,\" I replied: \"but as you seem in terested about her, we will go there in the after noon.\" She would have gone immediately, but I repre sented to her that Mrs. Patty would be flurried by seeing a stranger at an unexpected hour, and that we had better dine first. I took her up into my room, while Ann went to"], [170, "156 MY OWN PEOPLE. fetch Nelly, and as she was removing her bonnet, I could not help saying : \" I am so glad you are come ! \" Her hands dropped from her bonnet strings. \" Why are you so glad ? \" she said, in a strange voice ; \" there is some mystery \u2014 something you know that I do not \u2014 something relating to me and \" her lips suddenly began to tremble, and she sat down upon a chair near her. I hastened to her with some water. \" I don't know anything,\" I said ; and then I added, thinking only of Mrs. Patty, and not of the trembling woman before me, \" I suspect a great deal.\" She started up. \" Good heavens ! What do you suspect ? Tell me this instant ! I have suf fered torments since I saw you and that woman. Tell me, or I shall go mad ! \" She sat down again, and her eyes were fastened upon me with a look of almost fierce inquiry that compelled me to speak against my will, for I was fright ened. \" Pray don't agitate yourself,\" I said. \" I only think that Mrs. Patty Ringrove is not so insane as Martha makes her out.\" I dwelt on the name, pronouncing it distinctly, but it did not produce the effect I expected. \" Ringrove,\" repeated Mistress Bristowe, \" Rin grove,\" the fierce look on her face fading into one of bewilderment. \" God help me ! I think I am going mad. And that minx Sophy to have left me !"], [171, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 157 I have heard that name, but when and where I have no idea,\" and she laughed hysterically. \" Mistress Bristowe,\" I said firmly, \" you had once a sister ? \" The colour flushed all over her face in a mo ment. \"Yes, I had,\" she said, \"an elder, half-sister. She \u2014 she left home while I was still too young to do anything but love and admire her dearly.\" \" Is she dead ? \" I asked abruptly. \" Long ago,\" was the answer, \" and I cannot see why you, who seem to have heard some family particulars which I had always supposed secret, should ask me such painful, and I may add, such discourteous questions.\" \" My dear madam, I am grieved to appear dis courteous, but I wished to help you,\" I said, feeling that I must speak out plainly now at all hazards. \" The name of your sister's husband was Rin- grove.\" She stared at me without speaking, -her eyes growing dilated. She did not seem to comprehend me. I repeated my sentence, and then she found words. \" What do you mean ? Who can she be ? \" she said, with short, panting breaths between each question. \" I think she is your sister,\" I said desperately ; \" I believe she never died as you have been led to suppose. I told you her story the other day, as I have heard it. It may or may not be entirely true,"], [172, "158 MY OWN PEOPLE. but I feel it is so in the main. And I want you to see her so much. Oh ! I believe it might mend her poor, broken heart ! \" I clasped my hands in entreaty, but Mistress Bristowe did not hear my appeal. She had sunk back in her chair in a fainting fit. I was alarmed, and summoned Ann and Deborah, and, with their help, hastily undressed Mistress Bristowe and laid her on the bed ; but it was long before our restoratives had any effect, and when she did recover, and I had sent Deborah out of the room, she became so excited, and grew so flushed and feverish, that I got alarmed and sent for the doctor. He administered a febrifuge, and said that a few quiet hours' sleep was all that was need ful ; but recommended that she should not go home that day. Here was a dilemma for me. Sir George Bristowe might be expecting her \u2014 would be alarmed if she did not return. My relief was great when I found that he was not at home, and that a message to the housekeeper by the man servant was all that was required. To my surprise she made no allusion whatever to the cause of her attack, but lay perfectly still for some time after the doctor had left, and then suddenly sat up in bed and called for Sophy. I went to her and she appeared to recollect her companion's desertion, for she lay down again, and with a fretful murmur of \"ungrateful,\" she sank off to sleep. She slept for four hours, during which time I had an anxious conference with Ann."], [173, "MY OWN PEOPLE. ' 159 I say anxious, because I felt myself responsible for Mistress Bristowe's illness, and I began to see that I might possibly be mistaken. I had taken Mrs. Danny's word on trust \u2014 she might have exaggerated or misunderstood. I was un- prepared for Mistress Bristowe's total ignorance of her sister's story ; it was strange, and the whole affair might be gossip and fiction. If so, what could I say in my own defence ? Might I not be justly accused of making mischief, and of thrusting myself into a family matter which in no way con- cerned me ? I said all this to Ann in the sudden consternation into which Mistress Bristowe's faint- ing fit had thrown me, and Ann in reply assumed my own arguments to reassure me. We had changed characters for the time. She reminded me of the strange, dim recollection which our visitor averred to have had of Martha, and she told me to put this half-memory side by side with the uneasiness which Martha had most plainly evinced at the sight of Mistress Bristowe. Then again she told me to think how Mistress Bristowe could possibly associate the name of Ringrove with Martha, in her mind, unless there had really been some connection between them ; and finally she said that if I had been misinformed, the blame would rest with Mrs. Danny, my informant, and the worst that could be said of me would be that my compassionate feelings had outstripped my discretion. Yfes, I felt that myself; they had indeed! Discretion had never been a virtue of"], [174, "160 MY OWN PEOPLE. mine. My aunt used to tell me so, and when I married, she gave me a book upon \" Discretion and Self-government,\" which was so good and so grave that I have never yet read it. Perhaps if I had, I should not have got into such a scrape now ; and yet, somehow, I could not regret the scrape after all. If it all turned out right and true, and Airs. Patty's mind was restored, it would be so joyful for those two long separated sisters. And my \"if\" gradually became a certainty as I listened to Ann's consoling reasonings. Presently Mistress Bristowe awoke and asked for me. I went to her and found her looking quite herself, but for a slight pallor which, however, was more comfortable to see than the fever flush which had covered her cheeks before the doctor's visit. She said she was quite well, in answer to my questions, and then she begged me to sit down. I obeyed her with a little tremor, and she began to talk quietly and rationally, with no remains of agitation, as far as I could see. \" I am glad that you are so good as to let me remain here to-night, for though I feel perfectly well, yet I should like to have a quiet night's re flection before I go to see the person whom you call Mrs. Patty Ringrove.\" She paused, and I said something civil about happiness at being able to place a room at her disposal, and added that her servant had called with the chaise and I had sent him with a note to her housekeeper. \" Thank you,\" she said, looking about her a"], [175, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 161 little uneasily. \"I am afraid I give trouble. If I only had Sophy here, I should want nothing.\" \" What can I do for you ? \" I asked. \" I think I left my reticule on the table, with my salts and handkerchief; thank you, you are too good. And, oh dear! I don't see my cap any- where, it will be crushed if it is not hung up. No, not that way,\" she exclaimed, as I endeavoured to do as she wished. \" Pin the strings together, or bring it to me ; I will do it myself if I can see for the sun that puts my eyes out,\" said she, falling into the peremptory tone she had been accustomed to use to poor Sophy. I brought it to her obediently, and then drew the curtain across the window. I could not resent her fretfulness, for I felt that I already owed her some amends, and might possibly owe her more before long. When the cap was happily disposed of, there remained the stiff, silk gown, which nearly stood on end with its own richness, to be laid away in a drawer, and covered with a couple of cambric handker- chiefs, which, however, I could nowhere find. Mistress Bristowe declared she always carried them about with her, even when she only went to make an ordinary visit, for fear of accidents. It was really too bad of her waiting-maid to forget them \u2014 she could hardly believe it of her ; and she would have got out of bed to search herself if I had not cut the matter short by fetching two of my own. \" I dare say Sophy would have seen that they M"], [176, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 162 were not forgotten, if she had been with you,\" I said, a little wickedly. \"What an invaluable person she must have been ! \" But Mistress Bristowe was too much discomposed to answer. At last everything was arranged to her satis faction, and although it was only six o'clock, she begged not to be disturbed again till the next morning, and I gladly left her, wondering in my own mind whether it would be really kindness to inflict any one so fidgety on poor Mrs. Patty. The next day she came down to breakfast, look ing quite as usual, and no sooner were the things taken away, and Nelly had gone out for her walk, than she began to say that she was quite ready to make the visit whenever we liked, but if we thought the afternoon the fittest time, she would wait. In the meantime, she begged us both to listen for a short time to what she had to say. She spoke so calmly that although I murmured something about my hope that she would not distress herself, I felt that my words were not needed. She had made up her mind to speak, and silence would be infinitely more distressing to her, now that her resolution was taken. I took my knitting that I might not seem to regard her too curiously, and she began. \"When you left me last night, I set myself to think and to recall all that I could of my early girlhood, of my father (my mother died before I could recollect her), my sister, and of the servants who lived with us at the time of her elopement."], [177, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 163 I do not know, nor do I wish to know, how you, Mrs. Stirling, heard of her misconduct, but as you have done so, I have no hesitation in naming what until now has never passed my lips to any stranger. \" She, Patty, was my half-sister. My own mother had died, as I have told you, when I was quite a child, and she was my father's second wife. My brother George and myself were her children, and Patty was the only memory left to her father of his first child-wife, and his early hopes. She was very pretty, just like her mother, as my father used to say when he watched her singing so blithely about the house, and I thought there was no one like her. In fact, my feelings towards her were what I suppose a child has for its mother; reverence and admiration, combined with an un bounded trust, besides affection. When I grew old enough to learn, she taught me, and I have a vision of sitting in her lap over my letters, which always brings back to me the soft touch of an India muslin gown, and the scent of lavender, in which, I suppose, it had been laid. I was six then, and she was six teen. I have tried in vain to remember anything of the intervening years until I was twelve years old, and pronounced to be of a proper age to go to school. I was nearly heart-broken at leaving home and Patty, but was happy enough at school after a time, and my next recollection of any con sequence is my asking my father during my first holidays why Patty was so altered and dull, and"], [178, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 164 why she cried in the night, and his look of anger as he bade me never ask such foolish questions again. \"During my next two holidays she was away on a visit, which I thought very cruel and unkind when I wanted her so much, and cared so little about home without her. The next time I came she was ill ; pale and wan, a shadow of what she had been, moving about the house like a spirit, with no light in her eyes, no music in her voice. I was terrified, and could hardly believe she was \u2022my Patty, though she was as gentle and good to me as ever.\" Here Mistress Bristowe paused suddenly. I looked up, thinking it was emotion that took away her voice, but I was mistaken. Some sudden, long-buried recollection had been stirred in her mind, and she was trying to give it life. Her brow knitted with the effort, and presently she looked up, almost triumphantly. \"I have it!\" she said; \"it was the woman Martha who told me I was not to ask any questions, for that I should know soon enough. What did the words mean ? I puzzled over them, and then, child-like, forgot them. I have hardly ever remembered them again until now, after the lapse of forty years.\" She heaved a long sigh, but then went on with her relation in the same business-like, measured tone in which she had begun it, and which was strangely at variance with her words."], [179, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 165 \" Martha was wrong. I never did know rightly the meaning of Patty's illness, though I have guessed. I went back to school again. When I returned in the summer I looked for Patty as usual, at the garden-gate, under the laburnums. She was always there when she was at home, for the first glimpse of me, winter and summer. I did not see her. Could she be ill again? I thought; and yet I believed not, for I had had a letter from her only two days before, in which she said she was much better, quite well. \"I remember the dread which came upon me that something had happened. A foolish dread, as I thought a minute afterwards, for there was Patty with my father, as the chaise drove up, standing at the hall door. She had been right to say she was better, for I had never seen her look so pretty and bright. Her colour was positively brilliant, and all her old animation had returned ; in fact it amounted to restlessness, but I only remembered that long afterwards. \"All that evening I hung about her, following her from room to room, holding her hand for the most part, in the gladness of having her to myself again, till she laughed, and said I must not always be her shadow, and putting me from her as she stopped at the door of her own room, she went in and shut me out. I heard the bolt turn, and went disconsolately down-stairs, and wandered in the garden till the shadows lengthened, and the supper-bell rang."], [180, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 166 \"Eight was the hour for that meal in those primitive times, and I went in quickly, for my father loved punctuality. \" I would give anything to remember every minute particular of that last meal in the old room, but I cannot. Faces, tones, and conversa tion have faded out of the picture, and I only recollect the platter of strawberries which I, fresh from a town school-room fare, relished exceed ingly, and the faint sound of a rose-branch which every now and then tapped at the window, and each time made Patty start. How little I thought of the reason of those nervous tremors of hers, with which the rose-branch had nothing to do ! If I had been one year older or wiser, I might perhaps have saved her ! But it matters little now. \" I was sent to bed early, and I was tired with my long journey and my excitement, and glad to go. I slept in a little room adjoining Patty's. My slumbers were long and sound, no doubt, for when I awoke, the moonlight was streaming through the uncurtained window. You can believe or not what I am going to say ; most likely you will not, but it is true. Directly I awoke, some impulse which I could no more resist than I could have disobeyed my father if he had given me an order, compelled me to rise, dress myself, and go softly into Patty's room. I was wide awake, but I felt as if I were dreaming, or walking in my sleep, and I shivered, though it was a hot night. I can remember the"], [181, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 107 groping sensation with which I moved to the bed, though the room was full of moonlight, and the conviction I had that I should find the bed empty, before I saw that such was really the case. The pillow was undisturbed, the sheet folded down below it, and the night-dress lay untouched in its place. I went to the window and looked out into the garden, which was one confused mass of quivering leaves, deep shadows, and trembling moonshine. I opened the window and listened. Every leaf seemed to whisper Patty's name. Every streak of light seemed in some way in separably connected with her. That same impulse, which there was no resisting, took me down stairs, gave me strength to turn the lock of the door, and took me out into the garden, mysterious in the bright, unwonted light, which lay brooding over it like the glory on a dead face. Once there, the agency, trance, spell, call it what you may, under which I seemed to have been acting, dis appeared, and I felt alone and afraid. ' Oh, Patty ! Patty ! ' I cried out in an agony. As I looked helplessly about, bewildered, and hardly knowing where I was, I heard a faint rustle near me, a murmur of two voices, and Patty's arms were round my neck, and I was clasped tightly to her warm bosom. But even her presence and embrace were not enough to soothe my alarm. I clung to her, but I shall never forget the agony of fear I went through while we stood there together. For weeks afterwards it recurred to me, and shook"], [182, "168 MY OWN PEOPLE. me with a dread which almost overpowered my reason. Patty did not try to soothe me, she only stood quite, quite still, with her arms tightening round me, till at last I could bear the pressure no longer, and struggled out of her clasp. But still I could not speak, and the strange horror pressed upon me. What was it all ? What was going to happen ? Why was I there in the garden, under the moon at that hour ? And why was Patty standing looking at me so silently ? And whose was the other voice I had heard under the trees ? I have not the least idea \u2014 I never had \u2014 how long our strange silence lasted. It was broken at length by a whisper from Patty. \" ' Susie, my child, go back to bed. Kiss me, kiss me.' \"To bed; how commonplace, and yet how strange the words sounded to me. I instinc tively obeyed her. I lifted up my face to hers. She kissed me, a short, eager kiss, not at all like her usual, soft, lingering ones, but as if she dared not trust herself to make it long. \"'Now, go in, Susie, my darling,' she said. I turned submissively, but as I did so the sense of fear, overmastered for a moment, repossessed me. I turned back with a cry, and held out my hands. \" ' Patty, Patty ! let me come with you ! Where are you going ? ' \" She stood looking at me. I see her now. Not as if she had any desire to respond to my cry, but so transfigured, spiritualised as it appeared to me"], [183, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 169 in that moment, that my voice died away, and I could only look. Could I be dreaming after all? She was pale, fragile, transparent, like the crea ture of a dream. But my heart was still throbbing with the tightness of her embrace. It was she herself, and the moonbeam must have transfigured her. I saw no bright colour, such as had mantled in her cheek a few hours before ; no smile on her lips, but, instead, a calm, expressionless, awful beauty, such as I have since imagined an angel might wear, who had never been human, never known what it is to have sinned and to have been redeemed. It is my last remembrance of her.\" \" And yet you believed her guilty ? \" I said in a breathless whisper. She wrent on, apparently not hearing me. \"While I looked, another figure, that of a man, stole out from under the trees and touched her. She turned at the touch, gave me one more stead fast look, and glided away. I walked quietly into the house and up-stairs, my fear all melted away, and got into bed, and in a little time, I suppose, everything faded out of my mind, and I slept. When I awoke in the morning, my dream, as I believed it to be, came into my mind, and I went into Patty's room in my night-gown, to reassure myself by the sight of her. The empty bed brought the reality back, and with it the fear and ghastliness of the night ; and I must have given way to the pressure, for I have a very confused idea of what followed. I remember Martha's face"], [184, "MY 0 WN PEOPLE. 170 bending over me, and myself crouching down upon the bed with a feeling of illness for which I could not account. I remember, too, an unusual stir in the house, and my father's face so white and altered that I shrank from it in terror ; and I remember the doctor, a kind old man, and a great friend of mine, who, sitting by me and holding my hands, by degrees got from me all that I could repeat and recollect of my strange story. \" Then comes a great blank. I suppose I was ill, but I recall nothing more except a journey, until one day, in a strange house in London, I was lying on a sofa in a bedroom, and my brother George, of whom I knew but little, for he was a young man and I was hardly beyond childhood, sitting near me. Life seemed awakening in me that morning for the first time, for though my bodily health had been mending for a long while, as I was told, my faculties had been in a state of suspension, only roused by the terror which often fell upon me when the events of that far-off night drew near to my mind. At any rate, I asked for the first time after Patty. Where was she ? Had she come back ; and if so, why did she not come to see me ? I was very lonely, and wanted her. My brother's face grew pale and contracted as I put my questions, and I trembled before I heard his answer, I was so sure it was going to be some thing dreadful. \" ' You must never speak her name again,"], [185, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 171 Susan,' said he slowly, in a peculiarly harsh voice, taking both my hands. 'Do you under stand ? She is \u2014 dead, and gone out of your world.' \"The words fell upon me like cold iron. 'Dead, and gone out of my world ' \u2014 out of the world he meant. Dead ! and that was the reason of her pale, transfigured face that night, and of her long, farewell embrace. She knew she was going to die, then, and I had been impatient of that close pressure ! That was the first thought that darted its keen agony into my soul. I burst into violent weeping ; but my sobs were soon arrested by George's voice, cold again, and hard, and pitiless. \" ' Susan, you are not a child,' he said, ' you must understand that she has disgraced herself and us. I must never hear her name, and you must not shed tears for her. Rather be thankful that you can never see her any more. She is not our sister, thank Heaven ! ' I could hear him set his teeth as he said these last words. \" My tears had frozen, and I sat still, listening, but half comprehending, for I was a child, what ever George might think. It seemed to me as if I had been under the influence of a horrible r'ght mare, for ever so long, and that now I had thought it gone, here it was come to crush me at last. I drew a long, shuddering breath. \" ' Poor Susie ! ' said my brother, not unkindly, 'it is a great shock, and you have been very ill, and there is more trouble in store.'"], [186, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 172 \" I could hardly ask what new trouble it could be. Nothing could deserve the name, I thought, after what I had heard. I scarcely took in what he told me, that our father had never been the same after his eldest daughter's desertion, and that his health and spirits were so much broken as to cause serious alarm. He had left the old family house, partly from repugnance to live there after what had happened, and from proud reluctance to accept the pity of his neighbours, and partly that he might have London medical advice. \" It was useless. In a month from the time of that terrible conversation, he was dead. My brother succeeded to the baronetcy and estates, went down to live in the old house, and took me with him. We have lived there alone ever since. \" What my life has been, is little matter to any one but myself; but you will understand how your words yesterday, Mrs. Stirling, awoke the craving which has always dwelt somewhere deep down in my heart, where I scarcely knew of its existence, and proved too much for me.\" When Mrs. Bristowe stopped speaking there was a long silence. Between my sense of having done her injustice, and my conviction of the truth of my own surmises, I was speechless from utter ignorance of what I ought to say. I looked at Ann, and saw that her eyes were full of com passionate tears. But she was always ready and quiet in any emergency, and when she saw my embarrassment she rose and went to Mistress Bris-"], [187, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 173 towe and spoke softly to her. I could not hear what she was saying, but I felt that she knew what to do, and that I did not, and, watching Mis tress Bristowe's face, I saw it gradually assume a softer and more natural expression, and then, all at once, melt, and overflow with warm tears. Those tears transformed the middle-aged, hard, self-contained face into something almost youthful, and infinitely tender. Ann turned to me. \" I think, Lettice dear, that we had better go to Mrs. Patty at once. The sooner the suspense is over the better. If any good is to be effected by the interview, there can be no use in delaying it ; and if nothing comes of it, Mistress Bristowe will at least have had the satisfaction of feeling that something has been tried, and perhaps she will be able to learn more from Martha about her mis tress's state than we can.\" I felt the force of Ann's words, and got up to go directly. We none of us spoke on our way. I felt for my part like a child who has set some machinery going by a single movement of his little hand, but who is powerless to stop the impetuous life he has invoked. We arrived at Mrs. Patty's door. Martha opened it, and admitted us as I thought she would, and in another moment we were all standing inside the matted drawing-room in the presence of Mrs. Patty. She rose from her sofa, and curtsied with old-world grace to her visitors : begging us to sit down, smiling to Ann and me just as an ordinary hostess"], [188, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 174 would do ; but, she had in her hand a tiny red morocco shoe and a silk duster. She had been busied in her mournful daily task when we inter rupted her, and as she put it out of her hand, I suddenly felt it was presumption to think that any human agency could find a cure for that poor, distracted brain. I gazed at her more curiously and scrutinisingly than I had ever done before, and with a more painful interest. I tried to fancy her as her sister had described her to me : first, brilliant with life and youth, and then standing, pale and spiritual in the moonlight, but I could not. There was something so entirely different from either of these pictures in the little alert old lady, with the wintry bloom on her face, the vacant, smiling expression, and the gleams of intense sadness that now and then came and went over her features, that I was baffled. I looked at Mistress Bristowe. She was gazing too, but not puzzled like me. She saw something that I could not. One of those many mysterious, momentary touches which are so undistinguishable to strangers and so obvious to near relations, had flashed itself into Mistress Bristowe's heart and memory. I had no doubt about it. She had recognised her sister. And that sister talked on, and smiled. It seemed too tragical to be true, and for the first time I felt relieved at the appearance of Martha, who with her pinched-up lips announced that it was nearly Mrs. Patty's dinner time. We all rose, but Mistress"], [189, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 175 Bristowe being nearest the door, suddenly turned, confronted Martha, and to my astonishment, seized her arm with a strong grasp, and compelling her to follow, went out of the room, and shut the door, leaving us inside. Never did any hour seem so long as that which followed, while Ann and I kept Mrs. Patty in full conversation, all the while longing with throbbing hearts for our release. It came at last in the shape of Martha herself, who with an unmoved face, opened the door and said that Mistress Bristowe was ready to go. We found her in the hall, her face flushed, and her whole frame trembling ner vously \u2014 a strong contrast to the waiting-maid's imperturbability. She seized my hands when we were fairly out of the house, and began thanking me for the service I had done her, and then con tradicted herself by wishing that she had never known that poor Patty was alive, and finally spoke bitterly, and with tears, of the cruelty of her brother in keeping the knowledge from her. To all of which I had nothing to say, for I felt it exactly as she did. She went away home in the afternoon without telling us anything of her interview with Martha, and we could not ask her. At parting, she promised to write to me, and drove off, leaving me with a sensation of blank disappointment ; and yet when I came to think it over, I hardly knew why I was disappointed. I had established Mrs. Patty's identity, and her sister acknowledged her,"], [190, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 176 and was softened towards her. What more could I expect, or hope ? It was more merciful that she should remain in that state of undisturbed serenity, than that she should be recalled to the recollection of cir cumstances which must be most painful and heart rending. I could not absolve her from having committed a deception, nor from having broken her father's heart, but the swift punishment that had come upon her had been almost greater than she could bear, and her temptations might have been sore. Who could tell ! I had nothing to do with that part which had doubtless been fraught with agony to the erring daughter. I could only look at the present, and acknowledge that the Hand that had stricken her had been merciful in the very depth of its chastisement. And as for her innocence of that blackest calumny, if I had ever doubted it, I could do so no longer. It seemed to me that the last remembrance of her as she stood in the garden on the eve of her flight, was a sign warrant of her innocence, stamped in her sister's memory that she at least might always believe in her purity and unsullied fame. The more I thought, the clearer it appeared to me to be a merciful revelation from heaven, and the more I wondered that Mistress Bristowe had not taken the angel-comfort to her heart long ago. Mistress Bristowe came herself instead of her letter. \" I have spoken to my brother,\" she said, after the first greeting, \"and he owns to having concealed my unfortunate sister's existence from"], [191, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 177 me all these years. He says he had at first no intention of doing so \u2014 on the day, you know, when I lay on the sofa in the London house \u2014 but when he found that I had taken his words in their fullest sense, he gladly allowed me to continue in my ignorance.\" I uttered an involuntary exclamation. \" It was cruel,\" said Mistress Bristowe, in a hard voice, \" cruel and unjust. Did he think I would not have given my life to go after her and save her, if there was any danger? I was not such a child as that. If he had only said plainly : ' Susan, your sister has deceived us. Our father believes that she has disgraced herself beyond all recall or salvation ; but you and I know her better. We will find out the truth.' If he had only said this,\" said Mistress Bristowe, clasping her hands, \" how gladly I would have gone with him \u2014 devoted my life, if it had been necessary, to the search ! \" \" It would have been right,\" I said. \" And the other course was wrong ; cruel to me, to Patty, to every one concerned. George says he acted for the best. I do not believe it.\" \" Perhaps he was afraid of what the effect of the truth might have been on your father,\" said Ann, whom this part of the story touched a little nearly, for she flushed as she spoke. \" To be afraid of the truth can never be justifi able,\" was the reply, spoken with the sharpness of unhealed sorrow. \" If he had acted as a brave and honest brother ought, my sister's honour, N"], [192, "i78 MY OWN PEOPLE. reason, everything that makes life endurable, might have been retained. Now, that is all over for ever.\" She gave a groan of impatient anger and misery. There was nothing to be said. It was true enough. \" And I myself,\" she went on, \" you know what I am ; a fidgety, nervous, useless woman all my life long. I did not tell you my own story when I told you Patty's, because I could not describe how I dragged on those first lonely years, nor how afterwards I was driven upon myself, and my own petty wishes, cares, and ideas for companion ship. If I had had an object, even a sad one,\" said the solitary woman, warming into sudden con fidence, as she looked at our sympathizing faces, \" if I had had ever so sad an object in life, ever so shameful a truth to discover, I should have been happier. As it was, the silent, inevitable conclu sion I was forced to accept, crushed all the free life and will out of me for years, and then left me as you see me. But I mean even now to repair the wrong in the only way that is left to me.\" I asked myself in what way that was possible, and gazed with astonishment at Mistress Bristowe as she spoke. The very lines of worry and self consciousness, which the years she spoke of had drawn on her face, were softened away, and I had never seen her so earnest and almost dignified in the new hopes and aims that had risen upon her life."], [193, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 179 \" I cannot go on living at home in comfort and ease, while Patty is here as she is. I have told George so, and I mean to come and live near her, and see that Martha is fit to be trusted with her.\" \" And your brother ? \" I asked breathlessly. \" My brother thinks very little about it,\" she answered, with a quivering lip. \" He says I shall soon be glad to return to him ; but he is mistaken. Telling you the story has brought it all back again,\" continued Mistress Bristowe, her eyes full of tears. \" I could not rest away from her now I know every thing. O, Mrs. Stirling ! you think I may. Con sider for me ! There can be no harm, no im propriety ? You don't think she was really guilty ? \" At any other time I might have smiled at the poor woman's scruples, but I was too much moved now. I could have hugged her for her determinat tion, and I spoke out what was in my mind. I told her that I could not for a moment believe Mrs. Patty guilty of anything but imprudence, but that if she had fallen ever so low, I saw that it was only her sister's plain duty to stand by her now, and see the only scant justice that could be done to her, performed. The good soul thanked me heartily for my response, and then begged me to help her to see about a lodging. How curiously the romance and the commonplace blend together in this life ! All that afternoon was spent in looking over the vacant houses in Eastfleet, and in her choice"], [194, "180 MY OWN PEOPLE. Mistress Bristowe showed that she could throw all thoughts of self to the winds. I marvelled when I looked at her, as she stood undecided at first between a house of some size and gentility, and another of much less pretensions, and at last fix upon the smaller one, because it was nearer Mrs. Patty's, and thought of her as I had first seen her in the coach with Sophy. As I stood over Nelly's cot that night, according to my wont, and thought over my day, I realised what a sacrifice Mistress Bristowe was really making, and what a change to a person of her habits and age a small house in Eastfleet would be to the family mansion, and the luxury to which she had all her life been accustomed. If I had felt it at first, at my age, what would she do at hers, and with such a painful object for her daily contemplation ? I respected and reverenced her more than I can say, and whatever hard and condemnatory thoughts I had at one time entertained of her, vanished out of my mind for ever. Here occurs a break in my grandmother's diary, and the next entry, with the exception of some remarks about her child, interesting only to our selves, is dated a few months later. Febrtcary. \u2014 I have had a visit from no less a person than Sir George Bristowe. I confess to a good deal of nervous trepidation when Deborah came to tell me that he was in the parlour ; but my embarrassment subsided when I found myself"], [195, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 181 face to face with that gentleman. On his coun tenance I read distinctly obstinacy and self-im portance, and but little else. I felt that 1 could defend myself more easily against such a man than against one who was capable of generous sentiments. \" Mrs. Stirling, I presume ? \" he began, in a voice which was not without a certain melody, but which was inexpressibly distasteful to me. I curtsied. \" I have called, as probably you are aware, in hopes of seeing my sister here.\" I said I believed she was at her own house, I had not seen her that morning. \" Her own house ! Indeed. The cottage she has taken, I understand you to mean.\" \" Certainly,\" was my curt reply. \"A most extraordinary step,\" said Sir George Bristowe, showing no intention of taking his de parture, though I stood in order to give him no pretence for prolonging his stay. \" A most un precedented step, and one which has grieved me very much indeed, Mrs. Stirling, one which you may imagine I deeply deplore.\" I said nothing, and he fidgeted, and began again. \"I believe you are the friend who persuaded her to leave my roof, and to take up her abode here.\" \" No, indeed, Sir George,\" I said, \" you are to believe nothing of the kind. Mistress Bristowe"], [196, "182 MY OWN PEOPLE. took her resolution entirely herself, without any prompting from me or any one else. Her good, compassionate heart induced her to do what she has done, and I can only admire what I never should have taken upon myself to advise.\" Sir George's lips curled with a sneer. \" Indeed,\" said he, \" and yet, if I mistake not, you advised her on other points which were yet more delicate and personal. Excuse me, I am not surprised at your influence,\" he made me an odious bow, \" but I naturally feel that my sister's extraordinary desertion would hardly have taken place but for you.\" \" If you mean,\" I said steadily, and looking full into his face, \" that Mistress Bristowe would never have discovered that Mrs. Patty Ringrove lives here but for me, that is true ; and I cannot say that I regret it, when I see what a source of interest and affection the discovery has opened up to her, but I am sorry it has annoyed you, Sir George.\" \"Interest and affection,\" repeated Sir George, \" yes, of course, \u2014 very proper and right in their way ; but it has been the business of my life that her interest and affection should not be excited by an unworthy object like Mrs. Patty \" he came to a cruel pause, and dwelt upon the words with a cold, hard ring, which exasperated me : then suddenly with more warmth and eagerness than he had yet shown, and a total disappearance of the courtesy which I had all along seen to be only a thin crust covering his selfishness, he went on :"], [197, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 183 \" Good heavens, madam ! do I not know that women cannot hold their tongues ? That her story will be known all over Eastfleet, and the country round ? and that I shall be looked upon as the oppressor, and Mrs. Patty as the oppressed ? \" He recovered himself here, and went on icily, and with a smile. \" The story will not lose by repetition. I should not wonder if it became a thrilling romance of fraternal tyranny, instead of a commonplace tale of ruin and desertion, ending in imbecility.\" I was too indignant to speak with tolerable temper, and bit my tongue to restrain the words that were ready to burst forth. He stood regarding me for a few moments, and then bowed with a movement to go, but I had found my voice. \" Stop, Sir George ! \" I cried. \" You think I have interfered unwarrantably in your family affairs, and I do not wonder at it. But if you were to see your unhappy sister \u2014 if you had seen her tears and heard her desolate words in a moment of reason, as I have ; if you had been the daily witness of her kindness, her simplicity, and her pitiful talk about her lost child, you could not shut your heart against her ; you would be too glad that she should have some one to love her and watch over her ; you would be thankful to shield her by your recognition from insulting and unfriendly gossip.\" I felt my face growing hot, and my eyes filling, and stopped short, suddenly perceiving how hope-"], [198, "184 MY OWN PEOPLE. less any such appeal was to the man who stood before me. \" She has some one to watch over her,\" he said calmly ; \" do you think I have not seen to that ? \" \" To watch over her, yes \u2014 to love her, no. She is kept in a state of thraldom which benumbs her faculties, instead of letting them have play.\" It was an imprudent speech, as I felt the moment I had uttered it. \" I am the best judge of that, Mrs. Stirling, if you will pardon me for saying so,\" said Sir George loftily; \"you cannot suppose a brother would not be fully as interested in a sister's welfare, however erring and fallen that sister may be, as a stranger. I have every reason to be satisfied with my choice of an attendant. Good morning.\" He was gone, and I sat down and cried. I felt that I had been outwardly beaten in the encounter. Poor Mrs. Patty ! No wonder her mind had given way, if this man's nature had been the rock against which her love and passionate agony had been forced to break itself, in vain ! March ijth. \u2014 I see Mistress Bristowe every day, and every day I hope to hear of some alteration in Mrs. Patty's state of mind, but every day I am disappointed. She has grown used to Mistress Bristowe's constant visits, and has become fond of her, but no gleam of recognition has as yet come to satisfy the hungry eyes of her sister. Martha evidently resents Mistress Bristowe's supervision, but has wisely given in to what she cannot pre-"], [199, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 185 vent. I have reason to believe that Mistress Bristowe, in that private interview between the two, betrayed enough of her own suspicions to put the woman on her guard. At any rate, there is hardly an opportunity for any coercion now. But I fear that poor Mrs. Patty's mind has been too long under restraint for any rebound to be pos sible In the meantime, all traces of selfishness and fidget seem to have left her sister, so immersed is she in the one great object of her life. It is touching to see those two women together. To day I walked out, with the intention of calling on Mrs. Patty ; but when I came near the house, where I could see into the garden, I paused and looked at the two figures who were walking there in the still, sober February sunshine. The elder of the two had stopped for a moment to examine the branch of a horse-chestnut which hung over the paling, and whose polished sheath, with its soft, green tip, gave evidence of the gentle approach of spring. Her sister was standing close to her, not looking at the branch, but at the hand which held it, which was soft, and tender, and transparent with the delicate beauty of age. I heard Mrs. Patty say something about the bud she held, and Mistress Bristowe assent, and they went on. As they did so, Mrs. Patty made a little slip or false step \u2014 she was not so alert now as she used to be when I first knew her \u2014 and her sister seized hold of her shoulder to save her from falling. As she did so, I caught a glimpse of her face, transformed"], [200, "186 MY OWN PEOPLE. with tender solicitude into something almost beautiful. They went on, side by side, the younger woman retaining her hold upon the elder and more helpless one, with a gesture that con verted it into an embrace. I went away home, for I felt that my presence would have been an in trusion. May ist. \u2014 It has come at last. Mrs. Patty is dying. On this lovely May day, when every in animate thing is waking into life, her own is fading out of her into darkness. I got a message from Mistress Bristowe, entreat ing me to go to her this morning, and when I arrived, she met me at the door, with a strange mixture of joy and pain on her face. Mrs. Patty had been seized with sudden illness in the night. The doctor had been called, and had passed the sentence. She could not live, but the violent pain was subdued, and this morning she was quiet and exhausted. \"And,\" continued the now weeping Mistress Bristowe, \" she looked at me \u2014 full into my eyes \u2014 when she woke up at five o'clock, after a doze, and smiled, and said ' Susie.' She knew me, and looked as she did when she was a girl at home in the old house. I cannot stay away from her a minute. I must not lose a word or a look. Dear Mrs. Stirling, will you come up-stairs ? \" I followed her. There lay Mrs. Patty, with an indescribable change on her face ; so indescribable, so subtle, and yet so complete, that I had to make"], [201, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 187 an effort to realise that it was indeed herself. It was not only that death was stamped upon her features, and that they bore evidence of pain and exhaustion, but that a Presence was there, which I recognised with reverence as the breath of God. Reason, so long veiled, dethroned \u2014 call it what you will \u2014 had returned, and with it memory ; and in the weakness of the body, they triumphed, and asserted their dominion with a clearness that almost startled me into making an audible ex clamation. I have heard people talk of \" spiritual eyes.\" I think no one who could have once seen those which Mrs. Patty turned upon me, would have applied the term to any others. I involuntarily thought of her appearance, as she stood in the moonlit garden, as I went up and, awe-struck, took her hand. I did not expect her to speak, and almost started when she did so ; and yet the voice was low, and soft, and very measured. \" I am very happy at last,\" it said. \" I hope I shall meet her. Thank you for your kindness. Yes \u2014 I remember it all now \u2014 but I think my punishment is over. Pray that I may see my Hattie soon.\" Mistress Bristowe was sobbing audibly. \" My sister \u2014 my little Susie \" \u2014 went on the worn, weak voice, \" I loved her always, dearly, dearly \u2014 and if I loved him more, she must forgive me, for I was punished.\" There was a pause. I listened with an agony of"], [202, "188 MY OWN PEOPLE. eagerness for one word that should for ever set the question of her innocence at rest ; and thank God, it came. But the man for whom she had dared and suffered so much, was not worthy to hold more than a passing place in her thoughts now. What a world of subtle punishment that might have been to him, had he been alive, and with any feeling in his breast ! \" I had a husband once.\" The eyes grew wistful, only for a moment, and then inexpressibly calm and tender. She suddenly lifted her hands. \" Come to me, Susie ! I have no one left but you. None.\" Her sister knelt by the bed, and laid her head on the weak, outstretched hands, and the voice went on. \" It is a long, long time ago, for you are a woman, Susie, but my own little sister still, who sat in my lap, and comforted me with her eyes. Ah ! now it all comes back to me \u2014 my father.\" I stole out of the room. I had no business there in that sacred last hour, which would be so precious to the surviving sister. I left word with Martha, who avoided the dying room, that I would return in the evening. When I did so, Mrs. Patty was asleep, and her sister was watching over her, and I returned home again. May 2nd. \u2014 It is all over. Or rather it has just begun. Did I say her life was fading into dark ness ? How wrong !

And for the rest, no one will ever know. And why should they ? That lost child may be alive, and in misery and sin. True, but I for one will never believe it. I believe that the tender Father, who softened the mother's frenzy of agony, also took the child to his bosom. And for the man, the husband who wrought such a dire tragedy, and worked such lasting grief in two human hearts \u2014 well, I hope that his punishment began and ended in this world."], [204, "VI. FAMILY dissension is not a lovely thing, my dears,\" said Deborah once, \" and there was never much of it among the Stirlings. If I give you one instance which came a good deal under my own notice, I do so for the sake of showing you, first, how miserable a thing pride is, and what mischief it may bring about when indulged in ; and secondly, how true it is that no one can do wrong without harming somebody else besides themselves. You may take an old woman's word for it, dears, and it's a solemn thought, you can neither do good nor evil alone.\" I have told you that Miss Dorothy and Miss Charlotte both married. Miss Charlotte's hus band was a squire, who lived in a neighbouring county. He was a good deal older than herself, for she was but twenty-one, and he must have been near fifty, and her father was at first opposed to the match ; but Miss Charlotte's heart, or if not her heart, her will, was set upon it, and no argu ments nor persuasions could move her. Mr. Allworthy was a rich man, kind-hearted - and genial, with a pleasant word and a smile for every"], [205, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 191 one ; his character stood high, and his family was good : in short, there was no objection to take hold of, so to speak, and in a matter of age, young ladies are supposed to please themselves. It is not becoming in servants to talk about such matters, and I never would have said so but at this distance of time, but I wondered secretly to myself how Miss Charlotte, who was by far the cleverest of the family, should fancy Mr. All worthy, who never seemed to talk or think of any thing but dogs and horses. How well I remember being in the parlour for some reason, while the young ladies were all there, busy discussing some wonderful books which were then coming out, written by no one knew whom at the time, though I have since heard that they were novels by Sir Walter Scott, and better than any books of the kind that were ever written before or since. I suppose you will read them, my dears, some day \u2014 every one does \u2014 that is, every lady and gentle man ; though, for my part, I never saw the good a novel did anybody. However, as I was saying, the young ladies were all discussing these astonish ing books, and guessing who the author could be, and presently Miss Charlotte turned to Mr. All worthy, who had been very silent while they were talking, and asked what he thought. He said he had never read any of the books, and evidently hardly knew even the names. There was no such great harm in that, I thought ; but I shall never forget the look of contempt which passed over"], [206, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 192 Miss Charlotte's handsome face, nor the scornful way in which she turned from him and went on talking to her sisters. And yet she married him. The wedding was a gay one, but in spite of flowers and smiles and glad words, I could not get that one scornful, contemptuous look out of my head, and the thought pressed upon me that the marriage would not be a happy one. Time went on. Then came the old squire's death, our own removal from the Hall, our return, and the sudden loss of my beloved mistress. I had seen and heard but little of Mrs. Allworthy, excepting the successive births of four children, and of the early death of two. Almost immedi ately after my dear mistress's death, when the squire in his unutterable grief had gone away with his sister Ann, and I was alone with my poor, motherless children at the Hall, Mrs. All worthy came to spend some days there, and make acquaintance with her brother's children. Her husband did not accompany her, but he was to fetch her home at the end of a week. Directly she came into the nursery I felt sadly sure that my thought on her wedding-day had been a true one, and that she was not happy. There is some thing very different in the sudden, frank grief which would only have been natural to see upon Mrs. Allworthy's face on coming into that sad house, and the stern set look of habitual unhappi ness which I saw there. There was nothing frank or natural in Mrs."], [207, ""], [208, ""], [209, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 193 Allworthy's manner as she came in, held out her hand to me, and then bent to kiss Nelly and the baby Arthur. It was so steady, grave, and com posed, so much as if she had been long accustomed to hide her real feelings carefully away under a thick mantle of pride and indifference, that my heart died within me as I looked at her. Could she be really my Miss Charlotte ? She looked taller than ever and more upright ; her long black dress had a stiff rustle in every fold which sounded ominous, her face was pale, and every trace of youth and girlishness had vanished, leaving only a grave, stern woman in their stead. If it had been possible for me to be more downhearted than I was at that sorrowful time, Mrs. Allworthy's presence would have made me so. She had a way of roaming restlessly about the house which fidgeted me so, that I could have cried out with the annoyance. The frost had given way at last to rain and sleet, which came pitilessly down with very little interval for nearly the whole first week of her stay. I can hardly bear, even now, to think of that dreary time. My only com fort was in my baby. Miss Nelly was old enough to break my heart, by crying pitifully every now and then for her mamma ; but little Arthur was nothing but an innocent, joyous baby, full of dimples and smiles and cooing laughter, and he could comfort my heart when it was at its sorest with his pretty ways. Whenever there was a lull o"], [210, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 194 in the bad weather, Mrs. Allworthy would go out and pace up and down the broad terrace walk which was in sight of the nursery window, and there I used often to watch her, longing to go and ask what ailed her, and yet not daring to do so. At last she spoke herself. It was one wild even ing, after I had put the children to bed. She had been up in the nursery watching baby in his bath, and now they were both asleep, and she was stand ing by the fire, listening seemingly to the rain which was every now and then blown sharply against the window-panes by the fierce gusts of wind. \" Deborah,\" she said suddenly, \" my first little girl was very like Nelly.\" \" Was she, madam ? \" I said pitifully. \" Very like,\" she repeated, the hard lines of her face softening as she thought of her little angel daughter. \" She had the same pensive eyes, and serious, sweet smile, though she was only three years old when she died.\" \" How long ago ? \" I asked softly, thinking it would do her good to talk of it. \"Three years,\" was the reply, with a weary sigh; \"and Mr. Allworthy thinks that is long enough to forget.\" \" To forget ! \" I echoed in astonishment. \" Yes,\" she said bitterly ; \" to forget so far as to go out and look cheerful, and enjoy life when one's heart is broken.\" \"Oh, Miss Charlotte ! \" I exclaimed with tears, \"not broken ! Don't say that ! You have children left.\""], [211, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 195 \" No daughter. My boys will leave me ; and I shall have no daughter to be with me and cling to me when everything else is gone.\" \" You will have your husband,\" I said timidly, for I had remarked that she hardly ever mentioned his name ; and when she did, she never called him \" my husband,\" only ceremoniously, \" Mr. Allworthy.\" \" You will have your husband,\" I said. She was silent ; but I saw her face change. The features which had relaxed, and over which the firelight had cast something of a tenderer glow, took of a sudden a look of harshness and pride. She turned her face a little more towards me, and it looked sharp and hard. \" Yes, I have a husband, Deborah, as you say,\" she replied slowly; \"but he does not understand me. You know nothing about it.\" I was shocked at the cold, indifferent tone she used in speaking such words. I could not be silent. May be I had been over-indulged in the happy days that were gone, but I determined to speak out, and to take my chance of her anger. \" Miss Charlotte \u2014 I beg your pardon, Mrs. All worthy,\" I said, \"no man, in my opinion, would understand his wife loving her children better than her husband.\" She looked up at me and a great flush, the first bit of colour I had seen in her face since she came to the Hall, rose up to the roots of her hair. I was afraid she might forbid me to say anything more, so I went hurriedly on. I felt that the experience"], [212, "196 MY OWN PEOPLE. I had so lately passed through myself, had added many years to my age, and had given me an in sight into a good deal of which a year before I was ignorant ; I went on,\u2014 \" Miss Charlotte, you are not happy.\" I could not help calling her so, when I was so troubled about her, and loved her so dearly. \"Is it likely I should be?\" she said, the flush fading. \" I do not know why you should not be, with so many good things round you, and so many to love you.\" \" So that is your idea of happiness ! \" she said scornfully ; \" good things round me, and many to love me ! What if those very things weary me instead of making me happy ? What if I long to be rid of them, never to see them again, so that I could have the one thing I have lost ? \" \" Then, miss,\" I said, \" I think 370U are just wanting to choose what no one in this world can choose, and finding fault with Providence.\" \" I find no fault with any one or anything,\" she said gloomily, sitting down and letting her hands drop on her lap. \" I only want to be let alone ; and if Letitia had lived, and I had died, that would have been about the best thing that could have hap pened, Deborah.\" I could not yet hear that name mentioned. I burst out crying. Miss Charlotte got up and came to me, but she shed no tear herself, and I very soon forced back mine, and dried my eyes."], [213, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 197 \" Oh, Miss Charlotte ! Miss Charlotte ! \" I said, \" how can you speak so ! What is the matter ? Won't you tell me?\" \"Nothing that you can mend, Deborah,\" she answered. \" Telling one's troubles sometimes mends them,\" I persisted. \" I can't bear to see you so changed from what you used to be. It's not only that you are thin and pale, but the very look on your face is altered.\" \" I do not look so amiable as I did, Deborah, you mean,\" she said, with a kind of smile ; \" I feel that without a glass.\" \" You have grown to hide what you feel,\" I went on, \" and to pretend you don't care for anything ; and oh, my dear, that is a bitter mistake ! Don't go on so : it is killing you ! \" \" Deborah, you are talking of what you do not understand. I have very little feeling of any kind left, I believe ; there is no pretence in the matter, and no one else has ever found out what you fancy.\" It was no fancy, I knew that ; and I felt, too, that she had a certain pleasure and relief in talk ing to me, though she was seemingly so bent on keeping me in the dark. I thought I should find out the truth if I went on, so I said, \" Your hus band comes to-morrow.\" She started up. \"Yes, he does,\" she said, \"but I shall not see him.\" \" Not see him ! \" I cried in dismay."], [214, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 198 \" No ; I have made up my mind not to go home again for a time. You are right. It is killing me. Listen, and you shall hear all about it.\" She would not sit again, but paced up and down the room, speaking under her breath. \" You know I have lost two children \u2014 girls. Th e first was hardly two years after my marriage, and I thought my heart would break then, but it did not ; for my two boys were born, one after the other \u2014 noble children, Deborah, but not like my first-born. Well, then another daughter came, to bless me, as I thought ; a fair little blossom with violet eyes, like Nelly's, and a serious, shy face that enchanted others besides me. Do you recol lect poor Agatha ? Well, she was like her, and I gave her the same name. She lived for three years. How I loved her! Love is no word for my feeling, it is poor and commonplace. I could not bear her out of my sight. She filled my whole heart, till it overflowed with very rapture. And she died. She caught a cold, and the cold turned to inflammation, and she was torn from me. Deborah, I was mad, I believe, for a time, or insensible ; for I don't remember what I said or did, till one day Mr. Allworthy came to me and asked me to come out with him, and when I refused, he said I ought to make an effort to shake off my sorrow for his sake, and to remember my other children. His sake ! \" she repeated, with inexpressible scorn in her voice. \" What had he ever been to me that I should forget my darling"], [215, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 199 for him ? My other children ! The words nearly drove me wild. I could hardly bear the sound of their voices. I told my husband to go and enjoy himself without me, and to do what he liked with the boys, for I would never interfere or trouble him ; and then he gave way to a storm of anger which only made me despise him. What right had he to be angry ? He could not comprehend deep feeling of any kind \u2014 I knew that. He had sorrowed for my Agatha, but had soon wearied of sorrowing. But he might have left me in peace, and have made himself happy as he liked.\" She stopped with a gasp as if for breath, and then went on. \" I listened to what he had to say, and made no second remonstrance. I was not rebel lious, Deborah; he can never say that of me. I did everything he wished \u2014 received guests again, gave parties, and went here and there as usual, and my husband is not yet satisfied. He com plains that I do not make his home cheerful to him. Well; how can I, with this gnawing pain at my heart ? Deborah, now I am once free, I cannot \u2014 will not, go back. I will ask Herbert to let me stay here for a time. Oh ! if you knew the relief! \" She stopped her restless walk and sat down, fastening her eyes upon me with a look which seemed to say, \"lam prepared for objections, and expect them, but they will not move me.\" This was worse than I feared. She was destroy ing her own happiness and her husband's, and"], [216, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 200 would blight that of her children if she persisted in her determination. I remember feeling quite overwhelmed at the misery which I saw she was preparing for herself, and at my want of power to save her. I resolved to make one trial, and to appeal to her love for her children. \" What will become of your boys,\" I asked, \" if you do not go home ? \" \" They will remain where they are, I suppose,\" she said ; \" they are too young to go to school. They will come and see me. I am not going to separate myself from my husband, Deborah. I shall do nothing that the world can lay hold of.\" \" You are sure, then,\" I said, \" that your hus band will agree to your plan ? \" \" I don't think he will care much about it. He will be puzzled, and angry at first.\" \"And rightly so,\" I broke in. \"Oh, Miss Charlotte, you cannot be in earnest ! You do not know what you are doing ! \" \" Do I not ? Well, at any rate, I am in earnest, and nothing you can say or do, Deborah, will move me.\" Nothing that I could say. But I had one refuge left; and when she was gone I prayed for her with many tears. The next morning I saw nothing of Mrs. All worthy till twelve o'clock, when I heard the door bell ring, and knew that her husband had arrived. Presently she came in with a note in her hand."], [217, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 201 \"Deborah,\" she said in a cold, careless voice, \" I have a headache, and I am going to lie down in my room. I do not wish to be disturbed. Will you give this to Mr. Allworthy ? \" One glance at her face showed me that I should never move her now. I took the note in silence, and went down-stairs. Mr. Allworthy was standing in the dining parlour as I entered, and turned quickly round, evidently expecting to see his wife. He was not much altered from what I remembered him on his wedding-day. He was always a fine-looking man. Now he was a little stouter and more florid in complexion, but that was all. He certainly did not look troubled in mind, for his expression was placid and cheerful, as unlike his wife's gloomy, restless face as possible. I lost my sympathy with him at that first moment, but I regained it afterwards. \" Mrs. Allworthy bade me give you this letter, sir,\" 1 said, holding it out to him. He took it, looking bewildered, as he turned it over in his fingers without opening it. \" Where is Mrs. Allworthy ?\" he asked of me. \" Up-stairs, lying down, sir,\" and I made haste and left the room before he could ask any more questions. Very soon after I had returned to the nursery, 'I heard, as I expected, the dining-room bell ring, and the butler came to bid me go down stairs. I obeyed with a good deal of unwilling ness, for I felt how awkward and unpleasant the"], [218, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 202 interview would be. When I got into the room, and saw Mr. Allworthy's face, I pitied him, but I could understand Miss Charlotte better. There was no anger, only a weak, puzzled look of dis tress. I would much rather a husband of mine had knocked me down than have looked as he did. Oh, my dears, never you marry any one whom you cannot thoroughly look up to and respect ! No woman ever did so yet, who had not bitter cause to rue it in one way or another. I stood at the door to hear what he had to say. \" Do you know anything about this letter ? \" he asked, nervously folding and unfolding the paper in his hand. \" I think I do, sir,\" I answered. \" What does it mean ? I think you knew Mrs. Allworthy j before she married, I think \u2014 \" he paused, evidently ignorant of what I knew, and afraid of saying too much. A sudden resolution came to my mind. \" Mrs. Allworthy has told me, sir, that she wishes to stay here for the present, and that note is I believe to tell you so. She is not well now, and is lying down, but she finds the quiet of this house suits her and does her good. She tells me she has been very unwell \u2014 indeed I can see that \u2014 and she is better already here. A change is some times such a great thing you know, sir, for mind and body, and I haven't a doubt that when she feels equal to going home, you will see a great improve ment for the better.\""], [219, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 203 Heaven help me ! I had sore doubts as to whether she ever meant to return at all, but I would not suppose such a thing possible. My mind was made up. I would not rest until I had tried to bring husband and wife together with a better understanding between them ; and, to do this, I must never show that anything like a separation, or even a misunderstanding, had so much as entered into my thoughts or theirs. Mr. Allworthy's brow cleared a little as I spoke. \"She has been poorly,\" he said, \"I know. A change may be the right thing ; but where is she ? Can't I see her?\" \" Not now, I am afraid, sir,\" I answered boldly. \" Mrs. Allworthy had a bad headache this morning, and is very likely asleep. Can I take any message you would like to leave ? \" Poor Mr. Allworthy fidgeted and looked dis turbed, but presently said, half to himself, \" Well, I suppose it's best \u2014 best leave her alone, and per haps she'll come round.\" \" Oh yes, sir ! \" I said cheerfully ; \" depend on it, she will. She'll come round in her native air, and be as well as ever she was in a little time, with patience and quiet.\" \" Well, well \u2014 I'll write, I'll write. Deborah, I've often heard my wife speak of you \u2014 you'll take care of her \u2014 you'll give her my letter yourself, and not let any one talk. People gossip so, you know ; and they might think it odd that I came here and went"], [220, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 204 away without seeing her. Hang it ! I think it's odd myself! \" \" I'll take care, sir,\" I said emphatically ; \" you may trust me.\" \" That's a good girl, and, on second thoughts, I won't write, I'll send a message. Just say that I'm glad she's better, and that I'll drive over again with the boys soon, and give her my love,\" and Mr. Allworthy put his hand in his pocket. I drew back instinctively, guessing his purpose, and when he brought out his hand again and held it out to me, I felt the proud colour come into my face. It was the first time I had been offered money, except as fair wages. \" No, sir,\" I said, \" I never took money in my life for delivering a message.\" \" Well, well,\" he said, putting his hand back into his pocket, \" no offence. I'm very much obliged to you, very much obliged, indeed. I'll just have a bit of dinner, and then go. And Deborah,\" he said, as I was leaving the room, \" be sure and give her my love, and tell her I'll bring the boys over.\" I went away, thinking that if he had not much \" gumption,\" as Uncle Roger would have said, yet he had a kind heart, which should have begotten kindness in return. Well, two days passed, during which Miss Charlotte wrote to her brother for leave to remain some time longer at the Hall, and, by the end of the week, got an answer, begging her to do just as"], [221, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 205 she liked. Mr. Herbert asked no questions, and expressed no surprise. The loss of his wife had quenched all feeling but grief for the time. I watched Mrs. Allworthy daily, but could see very little, if any, change in her looks or manner. She was still cold and unobservant, her face always wore the same expression of haughty, clouded in difference, and she seemed to take the same kind of sullen pleasure in pacing up and down the terrace walk in the garden, till she was ready to drop with fatigue. I was surprised at first ; for she had talked so much of the relief it was to her to be left to herself, that I had expected it to work some change in her face. But I soon guessed that she was dreading her husband's visit, and that I might wait in vain for any signs of improvement while that hung over her. He came one cloudy, chilly afternoon, when the sky was stormy, and the earth all moist and vaporous \u2014 a day when, for my part, I thought it needed all the warmth and sunshine of kind words and loving voices, to make up for the cheerlessness of everything in the outside world. I was at the window when I saw the chaise drive up, and Mrs. Allworthy, who was in the nursery, heard it, as I could tell well enough by the sound of her catching breath. But she sat quite still, as I said, without turning round to look at her, \" Here is Mr. All worthy, Miss Charlotte.\" \" Very well, Deborah.\""], [222, "206 MY OWN PEOPLE. The voice was so quiet that I did turn round then, and I should have been better pleased to have seen any amount of agitation than that cold, cold face. It told me that her determination was not one whit altered, and that pride had now come to help her to nurse her stubborn grief. The bell sounded, and I wondered what she would do. To my surprise, she got up off her chair, put the baby, who had been on her lap, into my arms, and gathering up her heavy black drapery, went slowly away down-stairs. ' I should have been glad if she had not worn that face \u2014 so handsome and so cold \u2014 but with that I knew there was no hope. While I sat, wondering, doubting and fear ing, I heard childish steps and voices on the stair case, and two noble-looking boys, of seven and eight years old, came into the room. Your cousin Geoffrey you will I hope see some day, and Charles you know already from his picture ; but even that, lovely as it is, hardly gives a proper idea of his wonderful beauty and grace. I could not keep my eyes off him, as he came first into the room, with his quieter brother Geoffrey, following him. \" Mamma said we were to come and see you and our cousins,\" said Charles, in a frank, joyous voice. \" Oh ! what a pretty little girl ! \" and he stopped short at the sight of Miss Nelly, who, frightened at the entrance of strangers, and now still more abashed at the boy's sudden exclamation, shrank behind my chair, her little fair face all one sudden blaze of colour."], [223, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 207 \" See ! this is your cousin too, sir,\" I said, showing him the baby in my arms. \" I don't much care for little babies,\" he said, after one look, and then ran to the window, while Geoffrey gently stroked the little Arthur's head, and looking at me, whispered earnestly, \" Is mamma coming back home ? \" \" I do not know,\" I said, feeling quite discon certed under his look. \" I'm afraid not.\" \" Is she not well yet ? \" \" No, sir.\" \" Poor mamma ! \" And the gentle little thought ful face clouded over. It seemed to me as if that cloud was the begin ning of the blight with which their mother was preparing to darken her boys' lives through her own wilfulness. I tried to dispel it by talking to baby, and getting him to look and crow at his cousin, but the young face kept its gravity. Alas ! I lived to see it graver still ! In the meantime, his brother was trying to coax Miss Nelly out of her shyness, and had succeeded so far as to beguile her to the window, where she stood listening with grave eyes, while he talked about the war, and battle, and fighting. Most boys were all agog to be soldiers then, and I could see that the constant talk about the war which he must have heard, had filled his mind and fired his spirit. In the middle, his father's voice was heard calling, \" Charlie ! Geoff! \" He gave Nelly a hearty kiss, and was off in a moment, while little Geoffrey"], [224, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 208 stopped a moment to say good-bye to me, and then followed his brother. I waited for what should follow. I heard the chaise drive off, and then Mrs. Allworthy come up-stairs, but she did not stop at my door, but turned off to her own room and remained there till tea-time. After tea, she came into the nursery, and I could see in a moment that she had thrown off a great weight, and with it a good deal of her gloomy reserve. She played with the children, and would hardly be induced to let Nelly off her lap when it was bed-time. She asked me about her boys \u2014 what I thought of them \u2014 and talked of them and their boyish ways more freely than she had ever done tome before. When she said \"good night,\" and left me, I sat down to my needlework with dismay at my heart. It seemed so cruel for her to be happy when she had as it were driven her husband and children away from her \u2014 so heartless. There seemed so little hope for the future. The task I had set myself looked hopeless and wild. Nevertheless, I looked it steadily in the face, and tried to think what was best to be done. And I could see nothing for it but time. Perhaps when she was perfectly free to be as sad as she liked, she would cease to want to be so ; and if all opposition was at an end, she would not care so much for indulging her own will. She might get tired of being let alone, and go home with a prayer for pardon on her lips of her own accord. You see I was building upon the natural contrariness of"], [225, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 209 human nature, half unconsciously, and quite naturally. I was right so far, but I did not know how strong a thing pride is, nor how tightly it can hold its victims, hardly letting them go even when they are crushed and heart-broken in the struggle with their tormentor. Well, my dears, weeks passed, and Mr. Herbert was still away. The first soreness of my grief for my dear, dear mistress was healing, but there were moments when the sense of our loss, of my double loss, overwhelmed me, and I felt lonely and deso late beyond expression, as if my life were ended, and I could never know real joy or grief any more in this world. When these moods overcame me, I used to turn my mind to some other subject ; the children, and what their future lives might be, or Mrs. Allworthy \u2014 more often the latter. Six weeks had passed since that last visit from her husband. She had not seen him nor her chil dren again, and although the change for the better had not passed away, and she had grown gradually more cheerful and natural, yet I thought I could see that she was not satisfied. She still took those restless walks on the terrace, communing, I fancied, with her heart, and perhaps striving faintly with the pride that was making her miserable. I used to watch her as she came up to the eastern end of the terrace, which was just underneath my window, and then turning round with a quick, decided movement, walk steadily along to the western end, and then turn again. Her head was bent down, p"], [226, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 210 seldom raised for so much as a minute to look at the turf, the trees, or the sky; but there was no faltering purpose or weakening spirit in those vigorous, unswerving footsteps, though the very habit betrayed uneasiness of mind, and a spirit not at rest with itself, and at the end of an hour or so, she would come wearily in through the glass door, looking utterly spent and pale. Her mind was stronger than her body always. In all this time she never alluded to our one talk about her circumstances, and of course I never mentioned it. I think she would have liked me to do so, and that she was impatient at my silence, but I held my tongue and waited. One day \u2014 it was late in February, and the weather was still damp and gloomy \u2014 I was pacing about the gallery outside the nursery door with baby in my arms, for the children had colds, and I had kept them indoors, when I thought I heard sounds in Mrs. Allworthy's bedchamber, which was at one end of the gallery. I was afraid she was ill, but pausing outside the door, I distinctly made out the sound of a sob and suppressed weep ing. That evening she came to me, as she often did, when the children were asleep and I was at work in the outer nursery, and sat down by the fire. \" Don't you want to know, Deborah,\" she said abruptly, \" what my husband said to me when he was here last ? \" I don't know how it was, she had plenty of reserve and pride with most people, plenty very"], [227, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 211 often with me, and yet sometimes she would cast it entirely on one side, which was what encouraged me to do what I could to help her. \"Yes, Miss Charlotte, I do wish it, though I should never make bold to ask,\" I said. \" Well, you shall hear without asking. At first he seemed to take it for granted that I was going back with him, which I was quite determined not to do.\" \" Ah ! \" I said quickly, \" he supposed you were better already ; but I told him I thought it would take longer to do any real good.\" You see I had taken my line of action, and was resolved to keep to it. She looked at me a little doubtfully, and went on speaking : \" He was astonished when I let him know that I was not going to do as he supposed, and then he began to be angry, and asked me where I was going to live, and I told him that Herbert had said I might stay here as long as I pleased ; that I was happy here, and that I desired nothing better.\" \" Gentlemen are so impatient, Miss Charlotte,\" I said ; \" it's the way with them. They don't con sider that ladies are not so strong as themselves, and want more time to recover from an illness or a shock of any kind. It's thoughtless of them,\" I said with simulated indignation. \" I couldn't my self approve of your going home just yet, say for a fortnight; that would do great things, please God.\" She looked at me again, not doubtfully this time, but with rising pride and anger, but I worked on steadily."], [228, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 212 \" I fixed no time,\" she said, \" I told him that I wanted to be let alone ; but he would not under stand, he never did,\" she said bitterly, \" he began to argue. I sent the boys away and listened. If he had shown the least comprehension of what I have suffered, I think I would have gone with him, but he did not. He spoke as if he were the sufferer, and I \u2014 well almost as if I were a criminal. I think that has hardened my heart.\" \" No, not a criminal, Miss Charlotte ! \" I cried, looking up at her, full into her eyes this time, as she stopped speaking. \" Not a criminal ; you mistook him. Only weak and nervous still, and not quite fit to go home to your duties, to your husband and children. Stay another fortnight, Miss Charlotte, and then go home. Would you like me to write to Mr. Allworthy ? \" \" No, no ; why does he not come and see for himself, or send the boys as he promised ?\" \" Perhaps he ha's been expecting you,\" I said, feeling sure from this question that she could not be so indifferent as she appeared, and that her heart was yearning at least to her children. \" Let me write,\" I repeated. \" I will say that you will come in a fortnight's time, but that you are not equal to coming before.\" \" Why are you so anxious I should go, Deborah ?\" she said suddenly. \" Because I think you must be wanted,\" I said gravely. \" Your husband and your boys must both want you. Little Master Geoffrey asked me"], [229, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 213 if you were coming, and looked very grave when I said ' no.' \" I could see that her countenance changed when I mentioned the boys, and her hands which lay on her lap trembled a little, and moved nervously. \" It is a long time not to see them,\" she mur mured. \" Yes,\" I said, \" and a long time for them not to see you. Then I will write and say they may expect you this day fortnight.\" \" You are very pertinacious, Deborah, and a little forward. You always were as a girl. You must do as you like,\" and she got up slowly and went into the inner room and stooped over Nelly's little bed. Her face was flushed, and she said nothing to me as she passed out of the room, in answer to my good night. But I did not mind. Poor dear ! she had had a struggle to give in to me, and I could well forgive any irritation of feel ing against me in consequence. I sat down and wrote my letter before I went to bed, and posted it early the next morning before she could change her mind. It was four days after that letter was posted that I was seated in the nursery as usual. It was now nearly the end of March, but the long stern winter was not yet at an end. It had snowed in the night, and though it was fine now, the ground and trees were half-hidden in their white mantle, and the air was cold and piercing. It was much too cold for my children to go out, and I was holding baby up to the window to amuse"], [230, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 214 him, when I heard horse's hoofs coming fast up the road which led to the house, and soon there came in sight a horseman riding at full speed. As he came nearer I could see that he was splashed from head to foot, and had evidently ridden far and furiously. I knew directly I saw him that something had happened. Had I not but a short, short time since been startled by similar sounds and a like sight ? No tidings could be what those were to me, but they might be worse to others. The very certainty made me calm. I gave the baby to the nursemaid and went down-stairs to meet and stop the messenger before Mrs. Allworthy should be alarmed. I went out at the front door, and as he came near I held up my hands to stop him. I remember how the sun, which had been shining a minute before, was suddenly darkened by a cloud, and what a chill came over my whole frame as the man stopped his jaded horse and held out a letter. \" For Mrs. Allworthy,\" he said, and that was all. I motioned to him to go into the stable-yard, for my teeth chattered too much to let me speak, and I went back into the house with the letter under my apron. There was no occasion for me to trouble myself about the way in which I could give it to her, for when I got into the hall she was there. She had been startled, too, I suppose, by the unusual sounds, and had come out of the breakfast parlour. When she saw me she held"], [231, "Page 214."], [232, ""], [233, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 215 out her hand, and I put the letter into it. What use was there in keeping it from her for ever so short a time ? She knew, and I knew, that it con tained bad tidings of some sort. We neither of us spoke, but I followed her into the room she had just left, and stood near her as she opened the paper. It contained only a few lines. She read them and then sat suddenly down, and I knew that a mist had come over her eyes, by the groping way in which she held it out to me. I read it quickly. Master Charles had had an accident, was insensible, and Mr. Allworthy wished his mother to come immediately. I rang the bell to order the carriage and post horses before I looked at Mrs. Allworthy. When I did so, I saw that she sat quite still, her hand pressed over her heart, and her eyes looking before her at nothing. When I spoke to her she turned them on me with a look of only half-understand ing. \" I was going, Deborah, was I not ? \" she said piteously. \" Yes, dear Miss Charlotte, you were,\" I cried ; \" but you must come up-stairs with me now, and get ready to go immediately. Mr. Allworthy said immediately. The carriage will be here in less than an hour.\" She repeated the word \" immediately \" with a shudder, and got up, but staggered when she tried to walk, so that I was obliged to support her with my arm, and led her up-stairs. I put up a few things for her, put on her bonnet and fur pelisse,"], [234, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 216 and then went for some wine. The housekeeper brought it, dressed for a journey, and whispered to me that she was going with Miss Charlotte, which relieved my mind, for the poor thing was not fit to go that long drive alone with her maid, who was young and nervous. She drank the wine, and then sat still as before, waiting. In a shorter time than I had supposed pos sible, the carriage came to the door and every thing was ready. She got up (still with the same unnatural calm) and went down-stairs, this time without support. I helped her into the carriage, the door was shut, and she was gone. The husband and wife would be together again shortly, but this was a way I had never thought of. Well, you may suppose how anxiously I waited for the housekeeper's return ; and when she came, she brought the sad news that Master Charlie had only lived a few hours after Mrs. Allworthy's arrival, and that he never recovered conscious ness \u2014 never spoke, nor knew his poor mother. She was bitterly, terribly punished, indeed ! I heard from time to time of long fits of depres sion and silence, which made me fear for her reason, while I hoped and prayed that she was being gradually led, through a fiery furnace, as it were, to see the mistake of her life in its true light, and to humble herself into resignation. Poor thing! she did not learn it then, nor for years afterwards. It was summer before Mr. Herbert came home :"], [235, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 217 bright, warm weather, bringing with it something like a return of cheerfulness to our weary hearts. Miss Ann came with him, and Master Geoffrey. My poor master ! He sent for me to bring the children to him, but he could not speak. He could hardly bear the sight of them, I could see, and yet he would not let me take them away, but sat with Miss Nelly on his knee, softly stroking her hair, and looking as if years had passed over his head since his wife's death. And it was true that in suffering he was years older. Nothing ages like sorrow, and though my master was a Christian, and bore his great sorrow as a Christian should, it turned his hair white, and drew lines on his face which deepened and strengthened as time went on, and made him a melancholy looking man to the end of his days. I learnt about Mrs. Allworthy from Miss Ann. Master Charlie had fallen from a tree he was climbing, and had died from the hurt to his head. His mother had given herself up again to her own sorrow, and had been so neglectful of her husband, and so sullenly forgetful that he, too, had lost a son, that at last his easy temper had been provoked, and he had spoken hasty words which had been bitterly and resentfully remem bered against him. It was a state of things that could not last, and Mr. Allworthy had not resisted his wife's proposal that she should leave him. He was generous to her even in his anger, and provided a house for her at some distance, and"], [236, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 218 a liberal allowance. With regard to his son, he was firm. The boy might visit his mother, but he must live at home as inheritor of his father's pro perty. Many a woman is proud enough till a child stands in the way, and then she generally humbles herself without much difficulty. But Mrs. Allworthy did not. She had hardened her heart against her husband, and that seemed to have perverted her whole nature. Miss Ann said that she asked nothing and complained of nothing; accepted what Mr. Allworthy offered, and shed no tear when she kissed little Geoffrey and wished him good-bye. Miss Ann begged for the boy, whose little heart had been half-broken by his brother's death- She asked to have him with her for a time, and his father consented ; and to avoid the gossip of his neighbours, and the despondency which was creeping over him, and which was so foreign to his nature, he shut up his house and went to a small property he possessed in another part of the country. And so it was that Miss Ann brought her nephew to her own house and he was daily at the Hall. The little boy was very sad for a long time, very grave and silent, and Miss Nelly would try in her sweet way to comfort him. Often, as I have watched those two children seated together on the lawn, your mamma talking earnestly to amuse Geoffrey, who sat with his grave, wistful eyes fixed upon her, I have thought that he was the most orphaned of the two."], [237, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 219 Our lives crept on very quietly for a long time after this. Miss Ann still lived on in the Manor, as it was called ; and to me there was always something very resting and soothing in the sight of her gentle, good face, and in the very feeling of her presence in the house, for of course she was often at the Hall. Mr. Herbert, I think, felt it so too. She had always been his favourite sister, and he was loth to let her go home even when she had been at the Hall for a whole day ; and the housekeeper had orders to keep a bedchamber always ready in case she ever wished to sleep, which she did on two or three occasions of child ish ailments in Miss Nelly. It was from her that I learnt about Mrs. Allworthy from time to time. First, that she was living very quietly at the house her husband had given her. Then of a visit Miss Ann had paid her with little Master Geoffrey, and how she had cried so bitterly and owned herself wrong, but had passionately refused to say as much to her husband, or to allow Miss Ann to do so. Later still I went down myself, taking Miss Nelly, who had had the measles, for a change. I was shocked to see the alteration that her own wilfulness had wrought in her, and to find also that her health was in a very precarious state, and that she refused to see a doctor, or to hold counsel with any one. She was fairly in a way to kill herself; and when I found that she did not sleep, and yet took constant wearying exercise, and ate scarcely anything, I could hold my tongue"], [238, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 220 no longer, and fairly told her that she was acting wickedly both to herself, her husband, and child. \" Not to my child,\" she said, \" not to him ! He is better without me ; better never to have known his mother ! \" and she cried till I thought her heart would burst, and I had to beg and pray that she would quiet herself for the sake of her health. We stayed there three weeks, and Miss Nelly, who was now eleven years old, and Master Geoffrey, used to pass most of their days in wandering about together over the great com mons with which the place was surrounded. Master Geoffrey went to school now, and was still a grave, silent boy \u2014 clever beyond his years, as I was told \u2014 and as full of thought and tenderness as a girl. I always believed that he understood his parents' unhappy position, and thought about it and brooded over it, at an age when most boys would have known little and cared less about any such matter. After circumstances showed that I was right, and that his mother's fault had already cast a shadow over his young life. But I am only going to tell you of her now. I thought I was sure that she pined secretly for the power of going home, and I wrote to Miss Ann to tell her so, and I mentioned the delicate state of her sister's health, which indeed gave me a great deal of uneasiness. She had a cough which seemed fixed, and she had grown to look thin and flushed, and her hands were deadly white, like a person in a fever ; and"], [239, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 221 she was weak and listless, quite unlike the Stir lings, who had always been full of life and eager ness and activity. I was more uneasy than I chose to confess even to myself. I did .not get any answer to my letter for some time, and while I waited for it I could not keep myself from planning for Miss Charlotte to go back to her husband. Sometimes I thought I would write to him and tell him how ill and wretched she was ; sometimes that I would start off myself and see him, and explain how matters stood ; and oftener I pleased myself with the idea of going with her to her home where Mr. Allworthy now was, of her unex pected arrival, and of the reconciliation which would take place between the husband and wife separated for five years. The idea grew and grew, and I thought of it, dreamed of it, and prayed about it, till it became more than an idea \u2014 a fixed plan which I was resolved, God helping me, to carry out. I thought Miss Charlotte's pride was nearly worn out of her by this time, or I should never have dared to make the bold stroke I did. But it was more than I could bear to see her pining away her life, all for the want of one miserable word which I might speak. It was late in July, still brilliant weather, when Master Geoffrey had to go back to school. Chil dren of his age \u2014 he was but twelve \u2014 should never have found out that their parents can do wrong, but he had. When he kissed his mother I saw"], [240, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 222 him lift his eyes for a moment, with a puzzled, questioning look to her face, and when he got no answer to his look, only a long embrace which almost broke into a sob, and then an instant return to the old, quiet self-restraint, which was so infinitely more pitiful than the most violent tears could have been, his own face took again the expression of sweet patience which was grow ing to be settled there. After he went I began to act up to my resolution. I never could bear to be quiet when I had once made up my mind. I went to Miss Charlotte and told her that she was very poorly, I knew it, however she might choose to deny the fact, and that she must have change. Would she come with me ? She began to tremble as I asked her the question, for she was no longer strong enough to hide all she felt as completely as she used to do. She looked up at me as if she were going to ask a question, and then dropped her eyes again suddenly, and said nothing. I went on enlarging upon the fine ness and warmth of the weather, so suited for travelling, and how I would leave Miss Nelly under the care of Miss Charlotte's own maid, if she would let me be her travelling companion. I never spoke a word of where I wanted to take her, and she never asked me ; but she knew, and I felt that she knew, though we neither of us wished to acknowledge it to the other. After that I never said anything more about the journey, but pre pared for it, silently and quickly. I think it was"], [241, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 223 strange now, that as I did so, no misgivings of any kind entered into my thoughts, no fears of how Mr. Allworthy might receive his wife, nor any doubts about the wisdom of the course I was taking. Miss Charlotte's maid was very fond of Miss Nelly, and readily undertook the charge of her, gladly giving up to me any preparation of her mistress's things that might be necessary. There was but little to be done, for Miss Charlotte had cared nothing about her dress or appearance these desolate years, and had never left off the deep mourning she wore for her lost daughter. This had been one subject of dispute between her and her husband. A year after my dear mistress's death he had asked her to put away the heavy black dresses she had worn for so long, and she had refused. Now I wanted her return to be as perfect a signal for reconciliation as was pos sible, so I wrote to London for some pale grey silk, not light enough to shock her feelings by too sudden a change, and yet sufficiently so to show that she was no longer in mourning; and when it came I sat and worked at it with great satisfaction, and as its shining folds lay on my lap, I pleased myself with thinking that it was something more than a silk gown I was taking such pleasure in, and that it would be a token of submission, a bond of union between the hus band and wife. Well, the day came when all was ready, and I told her in the evening that if she liked we would"], [242, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 224 start the next day. I knew that she had been expect ing and waiting for this summons, and a look of relief passed over her face as I spoke. Still she said very little \u2014 only a few vague words about the weather and the time for starting, and then put her arms suddenly round Miss Nelly and kissed her passionately, till the gentle child looked at me half frightened. Poor, poor Miss Charlotte ! She had such a deep hunger for affection, and yet she had cast away all that God had given her ! The next morning I brought the delicate, bright dress, I had such pride in, into Miss Charlotte's room, with some fear and trembling, and as I laid it on a chair where the sun caught its lustre, I saw her cheeks redden for a moment, and her eye light up with anger, and glance at me ; but the look and the colour both faded away as suddenly as they had come, and she let me put on the dress without a word. We set out that day, and it was not till after some hours that I found out how very weak Mrs. Allworthy really was. She was quite exhausted by noon, and we were obliged to stop and sleep at the town where we had only intended dining. A dreadful thought came into my mind, that I was only taking her home to die. But she seemed very much revived by her night's rest, and I went on with a lighter heart. As we drew near the country round Allworthy Court, a faint colour came into her face, and she sat upright, and looked from the carriage-window with something"], [243, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 225 like eagerness. If you had ever known what it was to watch a face for long, which had no expression in it, or rather a mask of indifference, which you knew perfectly to be a mask all the time, you would understand the relief the change was to me. \"Miss Charlotte,\" I said, as we drove into a village, \"we can stop here. It looks pretty and quiet, and the air feels sweet and soft. I am sure I could make you comfortable.\" \"No, no,\" she replied, eagerly and feverishly, \" let us go on ; I can't stop ; you don't mean that I should ; \" and she looked at me with eyes which had an imploring prayer in them. I said nothing more, but we went on silently. It was four o'clock in the afternoon as we drove into the village. We had still a mile to go before we got to the Court, which lay back from the road, up a lane, planted on each side with firs and cedars. The sun was a little less powerful than it had been during the day, but still the shade from the noble old trees, as we turned off from the glaring high road, was very grateful ; I remember it now. There was a high wall on one side of this lane, and over the wall the fir trees stretched their great red arms straight across the road, the sunlight catching them now and then, and making them gleam like gold. Then came cedars, such as I have never seen before or since ; grand, stately, and solemn. And so we drove on, the sun shine glancing between the boughs, and falling <J"], [244, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 226 on the road in bright patches, the birds singing, and Miss Charlotte sitting straight up, looking out of the window, her colour rising higher and higher. At length we stopped at the gate, and drove up to the house. I had never been there before, and though it was not so grand nor so large as our Hall, yet it had a cheerful, com fortable look about it which was very pleasant. We stopped at the door. The bell was rung, and sounded loudly and portentously, I thought, through the house. I was nervous now, and when a large house-dog darted out the full length of his chain, and barked furiously at the sound, I started violently, and almost cried out. The man-servant who opened the door was evidently a stranger, and, in answer to my question for Mr. Allworthy, said that his master was out walking, but would be in shortly. He stared in surprise when we got out and began to superintend the taking-out of the luggage, but civilly asked our names. The ques tion rather puzzled me, but Miss Charlotte an swered for me in a clear, decided voice, \" Mrs. Allworthy,\" and the man's face brightened into comprehension directly, as I could see by the curious glances he cast at her from under his eyes, as he ushered us into a cool, dark room, which I took to be the library. When we were left alone, I ventured to look at Miss Charlotte. To tell the truth, I began to be afraid that now she might be angry with me for my bold venture ; for you must recollect that I had never yet said a word about"], [245, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 227 bringing her home, and she might have taxed me with inveigling her there under false pretences. A year or two before she would have done so, and when I looked at her, I could hardly feel glad at the change, though I knew it was really for the better. Her sudden colour had all gone, and her cheeks looked so like death in their pallor, that I went to her in alarm. She recovered herself a little when she saw my fright, and said faintly \u2014 \" Deborah, I don't think I can bear to see him yet. Suppose he should not- he might be as altered in feelings as I am in person.\" \" Miss Charlotte, don't think so ! \" I cried. \" Don't have such a thought ! He will be too glad and happy; I would answer for it with my life! And you, now you are once more here, where you ought to be, you will be as happy as he.\" She shook her head and answered \u2014 \" I have been very wrong and wicked, and I will try and do my duty now ; but there is not much life or happiness lest me in this world, Deborah.\" I shuddered at the ominous words, and felt them in my heart to be true, though I tried vehemently to disbelieve them. I wanted to remove Miss Charlotte's bonnet, and make her more com fortable, but she would not let me, and sat in the same position till voices and footsteps sounded outside, and the door opened to admit Mr. All worthy. \"Oh, dear!\" broke in Tiny at this juncture, \" oh, dear me ! How could you, Deborah ? I"], [246, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 228 should have died of fright, or run away. How good and brave you were ! Oh, I hope Mr. All worthy was kind to poor Aunt Charlotte. I shall hate his name if he was not ! Go on, please.\" Mr. Allworthy came into the room, pursued Deborah, and walked straight up to his wife. He was altered, and for the worse. In those days hard drinking was not thought the sin it is now, and Mr. Allworthy, I was sure, had got into the habit of taking more than was good for him. I saw it in his face. He walked straight up to his wife with a smile, but not a pleasant one, as his smiles used to be. He looked down at her as she sat drooping in the chair I had placed for her, and spoke cruel words. \" So you think you may come and go as you like, here, Mrs. Allworthy. You are mistaken.\" Miss Charlotte gave a start, and looked up at him. \"You are mistaken,\" he repeated, in a louder tone ; \" mistaken ! Do you understand ? \" Her pride had all deserted her indeed, for, instead of getting up on the instant to go, as I expected, she only said in a sort of murmur, \" O George, George, forgive me ! I shan't trouble you long.\" Mr. Allworthy looked awkward and uneasy at this appeal, and turned to me. \"Have you aided and abetted my wife in this fine scheme of coming to work on my feelings now that she has got tired of her solitude, and wants a change ? \""], [247, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 229 \" Yes, sir,\" I replied. \" I saw that she was pining her life out to come back, and could not bring her self to say the word, and I brought her home. I thought you would surely welcome her, but since you do not, I can but take her away again, and then it will be true that she won't trouble you long.\" I spoke bitterly, for though I see now that Mr. Allworthy's anger was only natural, I then thought only of her \u2014 of the struggle it had been for her to take the step, of the humility of her present conduct, of her failing health, and poor wounded heart. As I thought of it, I looked at her husband, and forgot that he had been deeply injured, and that his easy nature had been tried too long to forgive readily now. A deeper colour came into his ruddy cheeks as I spoke. \" She has troubled me with very little of her company for some time past,\" he said. I had drawn a little aside from Miss Charlotte's chair as I spoke, and now I turned round at a slight movement, a long sigh from her, and saw that she was fainting. The deadly struggle of feeling that must have been going on within her \u2014 shame, disappointment, yearning, regret, and remorse \u2014 each of these, singly, was enough to overcome her weak frame, and, altogether, they rent her with an agony which was very like death. When Mr. Allworthy saw her un conscious, wasted face, so different from the proud, handsome one he had seen last, he seemed moved, and went to her to raise her. But I indig-"], [248, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 230 nantly prevented him. She had sinned grievously, but he might have been more pitiful. \" I will take her to the carriage, sir,\" I said ; \" the sooner she gets back to die the better.\" \"Nonsense, nonsense, my good woman,\" said Mr. Allworthy uneasily. \" Who talks of dying ? I'm not going to send her off in this state. I'm not a brute. Ring for the housekeeper to take her up-stairs. Bless my soul ! she is altered a good deal, poor thing ! \" I did as I was bid, and we carried her away, still insensible, and laid her on a bed, where she woke to consciousness with a violent fit of \"cough ing, which left her too exhausted to speak. I watched the night by her, and this was how the repentant wife returned to her home. It was a bitter punishment that awaited her. No less a thing than to find that her husband's love for her, which had been hearty and honest as his own nature, had been hardened into indifference, his very nature warped and perverted, all by her hand. There was no question of her leaving him again, she was too ill for that, and he always treated her kindly and gently ; but what are such words, after all, for a husband and wife ! I could not stay on account of my children, whom I could no longer leave, but Miss Ann went down, and from her I learnt all that happened, and the end. How Miss Charlotte languished gradually, and how her husband used to visit her sick-room daily, and spend the rest of his time with companions,"], [249, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 231 some of whom were not such as Miss Ann could associate with. I do not know what her sister could have done without Miss Ann now. It was she who brought Master Geoffrey from school to bid his mother farewell, and who gave the last dying message of repentance to the husband who was away when his wife breathed her last. My dears, I should hardly have told you such a tale as this, if it had not been for a warning. Never marry a man for anything but true love and honour; and never let rebellious pride take pos session of your hearts and harden you. These two things together ate into your Aunt Charlotte's heart, poisoned her life, saddened that of her only child, harmed her husband, body and soul, and brought her at length to an early grave. Nurse had so often spoken to us of our Aunt Ann, and her name had figured so constantly in nearly all the stories she had told us, that once we asked her to tell us one about her, and only her ; something, I mean, that should bring her more clearly before us, and make us know her more thoroughly. She told us the following \"Chronicle,\" as we strolled and sat in Blackheath Park, one fine summer holiday. \" Miss Ann had no particular story of her own, so to speak. After the death of Mr. Herbert's first"], [250, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 232 wife, which I have told you about, she used to look much younger and happier. My dear mistress's death was a great grief to her, but she was one of those people who seem to lose their own sorrows in those of others. No one said, that I ever heard, in speaking of any particular occurrence of a sorrowful kind, 'Ann will feel that. I must try and comfort her.' It was always, 'I must go to Ann ; she will comfort me.' And so she did. From that early time, when poor, broken-hearted Miss Agatha called to her in the garden, under the yew hedge, she was the comforter of all the family. And hers was the happiest, calmest old age I ever knew. I have many times thought that the text, ' It is more blessed to give than to receive,' was truer of her than of any one I ever met with in the course of my long life.\" Tiny here asked whether Aunt Ann was as pretty as all the Stirlings. Nurse said \"No.\" She was generally thought quite plain and ordinary-looking by the side of her handsome sisters ; and she went on to describe her looks quite particularly, which was what I liked, for I can always understand people so much better when I know what they are like outside. \" Miss Ann was tall \u2014 all the Stirlings were tall \u2014 but she limped a little in her walk, and lost her height by stooping, whereas her sisters were noted for their fine carriage, and elegant figures. Her lameness was owing to an accident when she was a baby, and her stoop, I make no doubt, by"], [251, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 233 weakness from the same cause, for her health was never robust, even when she was young. Her eyes, instead of being keen and blue, like all the Stirlings, were soft and grey, her hair silky and beautiful, but almost too light, and her complexion too delicate and colourless. Somehow she wanted the rich red and white which made the other young ladies so handsome and admired. But her smile was very sweet, and when her face lighted up, which was not very often when I first knew her, as you may guess, I used to think her as pleasant-looking as any of the four ; pleasanter, indeed, than Miss Charlotte ever was, though she was thought the handsomest of all. Perhaps it was because, though I loved them all dearly, I loved Miss Ann the best, that I resented hearing her called ordinary-looking. \"And now what special story have I tell you about her ? I must think a bit.\" \"Don't let it be a very sad one, please, Nurse,\" said I, a little apprehensively. \" Ah ! my dear, no doubt you think nearly all those I have told you are sad. But you must con sider that I have only picked out just one bit from a life to tell you. Miss Agatha was bright and happy all her seventeen years till that fatal letter came. The poor French lady, too, doubtless had a happy home in France, and was blithe enough till that hateful war, and her separation from her husband. And then think of my Miss Letitia, why she was the brightest, gayest \""], [252, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 234 Nurse stopped, and her eyes filled ; even at her age, and at that distance of time, she sometimes broke off suddenly when talking of our grand mother. Then she took hold of my hand and spoke earnestly. \"Never think, for a moment, Miss Mabel, that there can be a life which has not a great deal of happiness in it. I have been very wrong, and have made a sad mistake, if I have led you to think so. Cares and sorrows may come, but they are mostly exceptions. We count them by hours ; but we might, if we would, count our happiness by days and weeks, and months and years.\" \" Like my measles,\" I said under my breath, for Nurse's words were so earnest they awed me. \" I thought them so long, and it was only a fortnight.\" \" Yes, my dear, pain and sorrow are longer than ease and joy, while they last ; but we often forget to count up the long times of comfort, when things all went brightly, and it seemed so natural to be happy. / have had my sorrows,\" continued the old woman reverently, gazing out over the distant woods with misty eyes, \"but I have had many joys, too ; I should be a thankless creature to my God if I forgot them.\" We were all silent for a while, and then Nurse said, in her usual voice \u2014 \"Well, Miss Mabel, I won't tell you anything sad this time. It shall be a cheerful story, if story it can be called.\" And we all sat still and listened."], [253, "VII. HAVE told you that Miss Ann and Miss J- Dorothy left the Hall when Mr. Herbert came to live there, and settled themselves in a small house not far off, called the \" Manor,\" that Miss Dorothy married, and Miss Ann was left alone. She lived in that house till she died, leaving it now and then to go to any of her relations who wanted her, but always glad to return, and live her tranquil, useful home-life there. We all loved her, and Miss Nelly's greatest treat was to be allowed to spend the day with her aunt, and her sorest punishment to be kept from doing so. When she grew old enough, she used to go there every morning for her lessons, and then she had her dinner and took a walk with Miss Ann in the afternoon. I missed the child dreadfully then, but of course it was very good for her to learn of such a clever lady as Miss Ann ; and Master Arthur gave me plenty to do. But I always went a bit down the lane to look for her when tea-time came on, and if I did not see her coming along under the old beeches with her aunt, I used to go on right to the Manor to fetch her myself. Now and then,"], [254, "236 MY OWN PEOPLE. Miss Ann would keep us both to drink tea, and as I had got Betty under me in the nursery, and could trust her, I was nothing loth once in a while to do so. \"Was that the Betty who was servant at your Uncle Roger's ? \" I asked. \" Yes, the very same, and a steady, sober young woman she had grown, though I never could cure her of her love for a bit of gossip. However, as I was saying, I sometimes stopped to tea in the summer, and I count those tea-drinkings with Miss Ann and my darling Miss Nelly in the pleasant parlour of the Manor, among the happy times I was speak ing of a few minutes ago. I can see the room now, and everything in it, to the very paper on the walls, and the things in Miss Ann's work-basket, and I seem to feel the summer air as it came in through the open window, and to hear your mamma's prattle and Miss Ann's kind, gentle answers.\" Here Janet, who was the only one of us who could recollect mamma, said \u2014 \" Please tell us about the room, Nurse. I want to know. I was so little when we went to the Hall that I don't remember. How I should like to go again ! \" \" I make no doubt you will,\" said Nurse ; \" but you must remember I am talking of a great many years ago, and it was quite changed when I saw it last, just before your grandfather died. You would think it very strange and old-fashioned in these days.\""], [255, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 237 \" I should have liked it, I know,\" said Tiny. \" What a much nicer school-room than ours it must have been, if that was where our mamma had lessons ! \" \" Well, in the first place,\" said Nurse, \" it had not a single straight line in it, and that can never be altered. I mean that the house was so old that the walls were crooked, and the floors uneven. And instead of a plain white ceiling, such as you see now-a-days, there were two great beams of black wood right across it, and neither of those were straight. The walls were papered down to the skirting-board, which came up very high, with a paper which was covered with birds flying over a trellis-work wreathed with roses. The skirting was black, like the beams over-head, and had gold lines round it ; and the chairs were very straight and upright, and were also black and gold. There were no easy low chairs and sofas, such as you see now in every drawing-room, but one great red leather arm-chair stood by the fire in winter, and by the window in summer, for Miss Ann to rest in, for she was no longer as young as she had been, and a little thing tired her lame leg. The carpet was a Turkey one, and the rug all needle-work, done by Miss Ann's mother. Miss Nelly was never tired of examining it. It represented a hunting scene, with ladies and gentlemen on horseback, and a group of dogs, and two hunts men blowing horns. On the border were worked the heads of all sorts of animals. Horses, dogs,"], [256, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 238 deer, hares, foxes, badgers, and such like animals, all done like life. I never saw such needle-work before or since. Your mamma used to be fond of lying down on that rug, and stroking the different animals, talking to them, and making stories about them out of her own head, which she would sometimes repeat to me afterwards. I believe she thought they were all alive, and she made pets of them and gave them names. She was a happy child, and no wonder, for she had a store of sweet, pretty fancies in her mind, which must have been Heaven sent. A carved wooden console stood opposite the window, and upon it some beautiful old Chelsea china, which Lady Ridgeway had given to her niece. There were a shepherd and shepherdess, and two vases, which were very valuable, I know, to people who care for such things. There was also a large piece of white coral, and a bit of rock amethyst ; and hung up against the wall behind, was what Miss Ann treasured beyond all these things, a rosary in carved ebony and silver, which had belonged to Mr. Herbert's first wife. She never would let Miss Nelly play with it, though I often heard her ask ; for the poor thing that was dead and gone had used it at her prayers, and so it was sacred, as was right, in Miss Ann's eyes. \" Well, I am getting on slowly, but you must be patient, for I am an old woman now, and like to dwell upon all these past memories. Sometimes I"], [257, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 239 think they are not past, but the only things that are really present, but I dare say that is because I am getting old and confused. \" One side of the room was lined with books, by which I do not mean that there was a book-case, but shelves fitted into the wall, and on the other side was a round mirror in a black frame, with a gilt eagle (the crest of the Stirlings) holding a gilded ball in its beak, fluttering over it. Then there was the bay window ; the front one opening to the ground, the two small side ones having their top panes filled with coloured glass, and the recesses beneath fitted with snug, deep window seats, with red cushions for elbows or knees. In the bow stood Miss Ann's little Pembroke table and work-basket ; none of your dainty little things which now-a-days seem as if they were made to look at, and not to use, but one to hold real work, lined with red silk, and always full of some kind of charitable task ; for Miss Ann was a true Dorcas to the people of the village. \"And now, when I mention the red moreen curtains, and the one faded crayon portrait of a lady (some relation of the family, I believe), I think you have the room complete. The window opened upon a low stone step, and from this you walked out upon a perfectly straight turfed path, bordered on each side with gay, tall flowers and bushes, such as lilies, rockets, sweet williams, hollyhocks, cabbage roses, lavender, and the like. A sun-dial stood at the end of this walk, which led into an old orchard,"], [258, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 240 thickly planted with apple, pear, and cherry-trees. There w-as a dining-room, a very pleasant kitchen, and six bedrooms in the house, besides the par lour I have been describing.\" \" But you have said nothing about the outside,\" said I, with the love of a child for details. \"Was that pretty too ? \" \" Well, not fine like the Hall \u2014 my master's house was the grandest in the country side,\" said nurse with pride \u2014 \" but well-looking enough. It was built of red brick, and had a pretty stone porch with seats, and on one side of it a pome granate grew up to the roof, and was covered with scarlet flowers in summer ; but the house was too low to be a handsome one.\" \" And now for the story, Nurse,\" said Tiny. She did not care so much about the description as we did, so she shook her curls back, as she always did when she was impatient, and repeated, \" The story, please ! \" \" I am coming to one, Miss Tiny, and I think it shall be about the French dress-maker ; that is more of a story than anything else I can think of, which happened at that time.\" \u2022 \" A French dress-maker ! what could she have to do with Aunt Ann ? \" \" You shall hear.\" The village of Cobden lay at some little distance from the Hall and the Manor. You did not go down that steep bit of road lined with beeches,"], [259, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 241 which I have so often told you about, but you turned up behind the house, past the church, on to the Down, and followed a chalk track for nearly three-quarters of a mile, and then you came upon it like a surprise, if you were a stranger. It lay nestled in a hollow of the Down, and seemed to have nothing to do with any other place but itself. When you got out upon the Down beyond it, if it was a clear day, you could just see the sea-line away in the distance. The same sea which I had seen for the first time when I was a girl, and had gone with Mr. Herbert's first wife to the little village on the coast, not above five miles away, as the crow flies. The track was good enough in summer, but in winter, and after heavy rains, it was very bad ; indeed, often impassable, except to the shepherd boys in their heavy boots, or to the horse of the good village doctor, who often had to ride across in dark winter nights, and summer storms, to visit patients whose houses lay scattered on the other side of the hill. One February night, one of Miss Ann's servant maids was taken ill. Miss Ann was a bit of a doctor herself, for in her young days every lady was taught something of the virtue of herbs, and to cure hurts and burns, and to make salves and ointments. But this illness was getting beyond Miss Ann's skill, and she sent up to the Hill for Doctor Staynes, and sat herself by the bed of the poor suffering kitchen girl till he arrived. It took two hours to fetch him. Perhaps it would R"], [260, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 242 have taken more with another, but Doctor Staynes never thought of his own ease when illness was concerned. The messenger found him in his little parlour, his feet on the fender, and a glass of elderberry wine simmering on the hob, while his supper was preparing. He put on his boots again, drank the wine, congratulating himself that it at least was ready and hot, and rode off down the hill, with lights and fire behind him, and the cold wet air of a February night in front. He found the poor girl in a state of inflammation which required quick and sharp remedies, and it was not until dawn that the attack was subdued. Then Miss Ann saw that he was exhausted, and ordered him a good break fast, in which she joined him. While they sat over it, she pressed him to take some rest before returning, but he declined ; so she asked if he had many patients just then, and he replied by naming all, except one whom he called \" The poor French thing.\" \" What poor French thing ? \" said Miss Ann, with a sudden yearning of heart which you can well account for. \" Oh, the young French woman,\" was the reply, \"who has been in the village all the winter,\" and Miss Ann detected an annoyance in his tone which surprised her. \" You must have seen her, madam \" But I have not. All the winter ! What is her name, and what does she do ? \""], [261, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 243 \"Her name is Mademoiselle Rose, and she makes dresses and bonnets.\" \"A French milliner is, you will kallow, some thing so unheard of,\" said Miss Ann with a smile, \" that I wonder her fame has not descended to the Hall. Poor thing ! I suppose she has come over like the rest of them, to earn a livelihood ; but why should she pick out Cobden of all places on the earth ? \" \" I fancy her fingers are too fine and dainty for a good deal that she has undertaken,\" remarked the doctor drily. \" You interest me very much,\" said Miss Ann \u2014 she told me the whole conversation afterwards \u2014 \" and what is the matter with her, that she wants you ? \" \" Oh, it's more a matter of climate than anything else. She has a cough. She is not accustomed to live on a hill.\" \" Poor thing ! \" said Miss Ann again. \" Has she money ? I mean, does she earn enough to support herself, and \u2014 pay you ? Surely not ! \" \" For the latter I can't tell yet,\" said the doctor, with a shade of impatience very unlike his usual respectful courtesy, \"but she lodges in a spare room in one of our farmer's houses, and I never heard any complaints.\" Here the doctor, who was unusually reluctant in his answers, rose, and with thanks, prepared for his ride home. \"When the weather gets better, I shall come and see Mademoiselle Rose,\" said Miss Ann, who"], [262, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 244 saw the reluctance without understanding it, and was too kind-hearted and high bred to force a subject upon any one ; and after a few parting words of advice about the servant girl, the doctor made his bow and rode off. Miss Ann was puzzled. Not but what there were a great many French in England then. The war was at an end, and many of them came over in hopes of retrieving their ruined fortunes, or at least of getting more bread to eat than they could at home. Some of them were sadly disappointed, poor things ; especially the women. The men, some of them gentlemen as highly born as the squire, taught French and dancing, and so gained money ; but the poor women, those who had no husbands or brothers to mend and cook for, and none to care for them, had nothing but their needle work, millinery, or artificial flowers, to look to for a livelihood. Some few of the better educated took to teaching, but those were only the few, and their want of knowledge of English stood in their way. \"But didn't they learn English as we learn French ? \" asked Janet. \" Miss Ann used to say that languages were not thought much of then,\" was Nurse's reply. \" Why, neither Miss Ann nor Miss Dorothy, nor any of the young ladies at the Hall learnt French : that has only got to be the fashion since their time. They picked up a little from their sister-in-"], [263, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 245 law, and Miss Ann, who was always so clever, took to it, and studied it, and knew more about it than most ladies did at that time.\" \" How odd ! \" said Tiny. \"Not odd, Miss Tiny, when you consider how little people travelled then. What use would French have been to folks who never left England in their lives, and who never expected to have any thing to do with French people ? It was the revo lution, and the war, and Bonaparte that first brought it into fashion ; and, of course, now that everybody travels, it is of consequence for them to speak all kinds of languages.\" \" And Mademoiselle Rose ? \" said I eagerly. Miss Ann was fairly puzzled. In the first place, Cobden was such a poor, out-of-the-way place for a Frenchwoman to settle in. London or Bath would have seemed so much more likely. And then the doctor was apparently afraid of saying much about the newcomer, or at any rate did not choose to do so, and his manner was most unac countable, as was the expression of vexation Miss Ann was sure she saw on his face at being ques tioned. However, it was February, and quite impossible for a lady to get up to the village then ; so the French stranger was not forgotten, but put on one side in Miss Ann's mind till the spring. March was snowy, April more fickle than usual, May cold and windy, and so it happened that June had made everything green and sweet and"], [264, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 246 leafy before Miss Ann was able to make her long meditated visit to Cobden. It was not to satisfy an idle curiosity that she went, but to see if she could be of any use to the poor stranger, who must feel so forlorn alone among the rough villagers. There was no parson or parson's wife to go to if she wanted a friend ; for in those days one clergy man did duty for two or three parishes as often as not, and Mr. Rogers, an old and somewhat infirm, but very wealthy man, was the clergyman of two parishes besides Cobden. He was driven over every Sunday to read the prayers and preach to the people in the morning, and hear the children their catechism in the afternoon, at the old parish church which was just behind the Hall, and sadly out of reach of the old and ailing among the vil lage folk in the winter, and then he went away, and was never seen till the next week. But he was charitable and kind, and never refused a shil ling to any one of the line of people who would be waiting for him after church, with pitiful stories of all kinds. Also, he used to give the squire five pounds every Christmas to spend in coals and blankets ; so that the people of Cobden had less to complain of than many. Nowadays things are improved, and parishes better looked after; but then it was different. Well, it was a fine June morning when Miss Ann started on her walk. Her maid behind her carried a basket with tea and sugar and other like comforts for the old women, and some pretty soft"], [265, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 247 stuff for Mademoiselle Rose to make up into a gown for her. When she got to the farmhouse where the doctor had told her Mademoiselle Rose lodged, she tapped at the door, and was much disappointed to find that she was out. \" But she will be in very soon, madam,\" said the farmer's wife. \"Do you come in and rest. It is a treat to see your face again, though you do look tired and spent.\" So saying the good woman settled her visitor in the great patchwork-cushioned arm-chair, and went off for curds-and-whey. While Miss Ann waited and drank the whey, her favourite summer drink from a child, she learnt a little about the young woman she had come to see ; found that she could talk but very broken English, as was to be expected ; that she was very industrious at any kind of work she could get to do ; and that she had a cough and a weak chest, for which Doctor Staynes came very often to see her. \" She is none too well off, poor soul, I expect,\" added the farmer's wife. \"And then she can't stomach our food, but must needs make her own soup and messes of one kind and another, which I don't believe are so wholesome as good bacon or meat, such as we have every day. I'm downright sorry for her, she must be so lonesome. But she looks cheerful; so perhaps I'm wasting pity. There she is,\" as a little figure passed the window, and light steps were heard ascending the stairs ; \" I will go and tell her you are here, or she will be"], [266, "248 MY OWN PEOPLE. flustered ;\" and the kind-hearted dame went off after her lodger. Miss Ann said afterwards, in telling me about her visit, that she was quite disappointed when she went up and first saw the young woman, but afterwards that feeling left her, and she conceived the greatest interest in her. I can understand this, having seen her so often myself. Miss Ann went up, leaving her maid in the kitchen, and found Mademoiselle Rose standing to receive her. She was a very little person, so small and so neatly made, that you were reminded of a doll when you looked at her. She had keen black eyes, a sallow complexion, very black hair, which she wore combed straight off her forehead, French fashion, and the smallest, prettiest hands and feet I ever saw. Everything she wore was as dainty as her self, though as cheap and common as possible : a black stuff gown, a white linen apron with pockets, a little white cap with a crimped border \u2014 that was all. But it was put on so neatly \u2014 the gown fitted her trim little figure so well, and the apron and cap were so white and fresh, that she could not have looked better, nor so well, in my opinion, if she had been dressed in silk and velvet. On one of her fingers she wore a hair ring, with an opal set in it, and that was the only thing at all out of the way about her. Her bed was in one corner of the room, and she had made a white cambric covering for it, with a deep frill, which made it look quite pretty ; the table was pushed"], [267, ""], [268, ""], [269, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 249 into the window, and littered with work, and on the window-ledge was a flower-pot, with a rose in it. She made a deep curtsey when Miss Ann came in, and then stood as if waiting for a work order. Now the reason of Miss Ann's disappoint ment was partly because she had made up her mind for a mystery, and mystery there seemed to be none. The little woman was as plain and business-like a person as possible, and spoke straight to the point. \" Good-day, mademoiselle,\" said she in her broken English ; and she had this curious thing about her, that she never seemed to be afraid of making a blunder, though of course she made plenty, but went on as quickly as if she were talking her own language, and a strange jumble she made of it. \"Good-day, mademoiselle,\" said Miss Ann in French, at which the little woman started and coloured up through her sallow skin. \"Ah, mademoiselle, what pleasure!\" she ex claimed. \" I have heard nothing so sweet for so long ! \" and tears came into the bright eyes ; and then she suddenly became the workwoman again and added, \" I await your commands.\" Miss Ann accordingly called to her maid and produced the stuff, giving her orders for the dress in such a way as to bring out the taste and skill of the workwoman, who proved to have plenty of both, and to enjoy having anything to do in which she could exercise them. Her eyes sparkled when Miss Ann said she would leave the trimming for"], [270, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 250 her decision, and she asked eagerly when the dress would be wanted. \" Can you bring it to me in a week's time ? \" said Miss Ann ; \" then I could try it, and you could make any alterations that might be needful.\" Miss Ann said this in the hope of getting an opportunity of more general talk with her than seemed likely now, though Mademoiselle Rose evidently thought so much about her work, that all the romantic stories she had been making up in her own mind about the little dressmaker being a countess in her own country, and so on, appeared likely to fade into nothing. Mademoiselle Rose hesitated. \" Is it too short a time ? \" said Miss Ann. \" I am in no great hurry.\" \" No indeed, mademoiselle ; but \u2014 pardon me \u2014 I never go out much ; I have not the time ; I might be wanted. And for alterations,\" she added, with a little proud smile, \"mademoiselle may assure herself that none will be required.\" This was provoking ; but as Miss Ann wondered what she could say, the little woman suddenly remembered that she had not taken the length of the skirt, and ran across the room for her measure. The quick movement brought on her cough, and she had to stop and put her hand to her chest. Miss Ann's kind heart was roused in a moment. \"Your cough is very bad, I fear,\" she said, making her sit down in a chair, and waiting till the fit should pass."], [271, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 251 \" It has been bad, mademoiselle,\" panted Made moiselle Rose, recovering herself; \"but that will pass. Now the roses are blowing\"\u2014 she pointed to a white rose-bush which was beginning to flower luxuriantly all up one side of the house \u2014 \" I shall make a tisane of roses, and it will soon cure my chest,\" and she got up from the chair. \" But what does Dr. Staynes say ? He tells me he is attending you for it,\" said Miss Ann. Mademoiselle Rose's hands began to fidget a little nervously at the black ribbon which held her scissors to her side, and she glanced quickly at Miss Ann with a sort of questioning look in her eyes, and then dropped them as quickly. \" He says it is climate \u2014 your fogs ;\" and break ing off as if with a sudden recollection, she added, \" You do me too much honour, mademoiselle ; it is nothing, absolutely nothing ;\" and she began folding up the stuff with neat hands and a quick movement which plainly said, \" Our business is done, and I have no time to talk on any other matters.\" Miss Ann was fairly baffled, but she ventured to say, as she left the room, \"Well, I think a walk to the Hall would do you good ; so bring my dress if you can.\" And then she walked home, thinking that Mademoiselle Rose was a com monplace little body enough, evidently devoted to work, cheerful to all appearance, and not over sensitive ; in fact, not at all the person who could be made into the heroine of a romance. And yet,"], [272, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 252 in spite of this, Miss Ann did feel a great interest, not to say curiosity, about her. She did feel sure that there was some concealment somewhere. \" No concern of mine,\" she said to herself ; yet the wish grew strong within her to find out more about Mademoiselle Rose. Contrary to Miss Ann's expectations, Made moiselle Rose brought home the dress herself at the end of four days. Miss Ann was in the garden, and Mademoiselle Rose was shown into the par lour to wait while the servant went to fetch her mistress. Miss Nelly was at the table in the win dow with her lesson books, and told all about it afterwards. That is to say, she told us how Made moiselle Rose curtsied to her, and then sat down in the chair placed for her. The chair was one of a row at the side of the room, so that she could see everything in it as she sate. \" I am sure she thought the parlour very pretty, auntie,\" said the child afterwards ; \" she looked at the things so much ; and I think she can see more with her eyes than other people, they look so,\" said my darling, not knowing how to express what she meant. \" First of all she looked at the picture and then at the rug. I should have liked to tell her what that was about, but I didn't know if she would under stand me, and besides, you said I wasn't to talk at my lessons. Then she turned, and looked at the coral and the amethyst, and the china, you know, and as she looked, I heard her make a sound some-"], [273, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 253 thing like a sigh, only shorter, and she started up on her feet. I was frightened, auntie, and I wished you would come, for she went up to the things, and put out her hand and touched the necklace.\" Miss Nelly called the rosary a neck lace, for she was too young to understand what it really was. \" Well, then,\" Miss Nelly went on, \" of course I went to her and said she must not touch it ; for auntie never would let me have it in my hand even, and it belonged to a lady who was dead, and Aunt Ann had loved her very much, and kept the necklace, and let no one so much as dust it but herself. And then \u2014 only think, auntie, she began to cry, and looked at me, and said some French words which I could not understand, and clasped her two hands together, and then you came in.\" This was Miss Nelly's explanation of what Miss Ann saw when she entered the room. Mademoi selle Rose stood by the carved console, with tears running down over her cheeks. Your mamma stood near, looking at her in her grave, sweet way, with a flush on her face, which deepened as Miss Ann came up. \"Auntie, she is crying,\" whispered the child. \" Shall I go ? \" \" Yes, my love,\" and Miss Nelly ran away re lieved, for the scene had frightened her a little. Miss Ann took Mademoiselle Rose's hand. \" Can I do anything for you ? \" she said gently. \" No, mademoiselle, I thank you much. I am a little unwell ; it is nothing ;\" and she turned, and"], [274, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 254 went to the table, and began unfolding her work, seeming so embarrassed that Miss Ann for very pity could ask no more questions then. The dress fitted to a nicety, and the work and trimming were so beautifully done, that Miss Ann said involuntarily \u2014 \"Why, you are not going to stay at Cobden, surely, if you can work like this ! What made you come here ? \" and then added, as the sallow face flushed again, \" Excuse me ; that is an impertinent question.\" \" Oh, no, no ! You are very good. London is sad, and they said I should suffer in my health if I lived there ; and I obtain some work here, and fresh air, and light. It is better than to live in the town.\" \" You are right so far, mademoiselle ; but the work here is not suited to your abilities.\" Mademoiselle Rose smiled, and touched the dress lovingly. \" This is the first robe of taste I have made since I come here. It has been a true pleasure. The dress of the English bourgeoisie, ah ! but it is frightening ; \" and she sighed. \" And you are going back to work you dislike,\" said Miss Ann, \" for no other reason than the one you have just told me ? \" Mademoiselle Rose dropped her eyes, and said nothing. At that moment a horseman rode up to the door, and Miss Ann recognised Doctor Staynes. He had called to see her about one of his patients in whom she was interested. Made-"], [275, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 255 moiselle Rose instantly grew nervous again, and hurried on her gloves, as if ready to go. \" Stop,\" said Miss Ann ; \" we have said nothing about payment. What is your charge ? \" Mademoiselle Rose hesitated exceedingly. At last she said \u2014 \" I know nothing of English charges.\" \"Well, and I know nothing of French ones,\" said Miss Ann, smiling. \" Will you tell me what you were in the habit of charging for such a dress as this in France ? \" More hesitation, and a deeper colour than ever through the sallow skin, and then the words low spoken \u2014 \" I was not a dressmaker in France. My sister and I, we worked for amusement only. She dressed her dolls ; and she was my doll ; I made her dresses sometimes.\" It was Miss Ann's turn to be confused. \" You must forgive me,\" she said, \" I must have pained you. You must allow me to say how grieved I am.\" But Mademoiselle Rose had recovered herself.) \" It has been a pleasure to make the robe,\" said she, \"and if you will add to your kindness by naming your own price, I shall be most grateful.\" \" And I will do so,\" said Miss Ann, \" with this understanding, that you stay and drink tea with me before you return to Cobden. You know Dr. Staynes, I think ; I will ask him to stay too.\" But Mademoiselle Rose decidedly refused. In"], [276, "256 MY OWN PEOPLE. fact, she seemed thoroughly distressed when urged, and Miss Ann saw at once she must say no more about it ; so with a few parting words, and a promise that she would come and pay her debt as soon as she could ascertain what it ought to be, Mademoiselle Rose hurried out of the house as Dr. Staynes came in. Miss Ann looking at him, observed a flush mount over his face as he caught sight of Made moiselle Rose, though it was so momentary as to leave her in doubt if she had seen rightly. After some discourse respecting the Doctor's patient, Miss Ann said, \" You have got a genius at Cobden, Doctor, without knowing it. Made moiselle Rose is a very skilled workwoman, and has turned me out a dress which would do honour to a modiste of the first water.\" \" I think I told you,\" was the Doctor's answer, \" that her skill was rather above what was needed here ; at least I heard so. Good morning ! I must get back as fast as possible ! \" And he was out of the house in a great hurry. Nothing more to be got out of him : that was plain enough, and Miss Ann was a little piqued, as was natural. She went, however, to Cobden with the money for her dress, and paid Mademoiselle Rose ; and several times afterwards she gave her needlework to do, out of pure kindness, and she would have me now and then go to see her, and take her a nosegay, or a French book. But she never renewed her invitation to tea, nor in any way tried to win"], [277, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 257 Mademoiselle Rose's confidence again. Made moiselle Rose always showed herself very grateful for these little kindnesses, and would sometimes look at me during my visits, in a wistful way, as if she wanted to say something, and yet could not bring herself to speak the word. Once she asked me about my master, the squire, and where he was, and if he would ever come back and live at the Hall. But I thought this question forward in a stranger, and was so backward in my answers, that she never said anything more of that kind to me. It has often seemed odd to me since, when I came to know the truth, that neither Miss Ann nor I should ever have guessed it, especially after the affair of the rosary. But there is no account ing for these things ; we never did. July passed, and I think it was the beginning of August, when one evening, just as I had come for Miss Nelly, Miss Ann, seeing the Doctor ride wearily past her gate, sent me out, as she some times did, to ask him in to drink tea with her. He must have been very tired, I thought, for he an swered quite eagerly that he would do himself the honour of stopping (that was always his phrase) ; so Miss Ann sent me and my child home, and she and the Doctor sat down to tea alone. What passed I will tell you as well as I can from my recollection of Miss Ann's own words, as she related it to me some days after wards. \" I filled the tea-pot, as usual, and served him s"], [278, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 258 with bread-and-butter and tea-cake, before I entered into any conversation. He looked tired and harassed, and I knew the best thing was to make him eat and drink. But he seemed too much pre-occupied to benefit by my remedies, and I was sure that he ate and drank mechanically, his mind all the while full of something else. I talked of the beauty of the evening, of some trifling ailment of Nelly's, and of her progress in her lessons, and then I laid my hand upon a book which lay on the window-seat within reach. ' By-the-bye,' I said, ' may I trouble you to take this book to Made moiselle Rose ? It is the second volume of one she is reading.' He looked up with a start, and replied that he would do so gladly. ' Gladly,' he repeated, and looked full at me in a strange, defiant kind of way. I did not in the least under stand what the look meant, but something com pelled me to go on and say, \u2014 \" ' How curious it is, that she is no dressmaker after all ! ' \"The Doctor made a sudden movement, and very nearly upset his tea-cup. \" ' She told you that ? ' he said. \" ' Yes ; why should she not tell me ? ' said I, a little mischievously, I own, ' as it seems she has told you ? ' \" ' I am a friend,' stammered the Doctor, who is not usually at a loss for words, but now seemed at fault ; ' that is \u2014 she has known me \u2014 I have attended her all the winter \u2014 she \""], [279, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 259 \" ' She has given you all her confidence, and seems oddly unwilling to bestow a grain upon me,' said I, a little piqued ; ' not that I wish to know anything she is desirous of concealing from me, but I had taken an interest\u2014 a fancy \u2014 the French tongue always goes to my heart ; ' and here I know I faltered, Deborah. Then recovering my composure with an effort, I added, 'I shall not frighten her with any more questions, Dr. Staynes. Pray tell her so. Poor thing ! ' and here I re- gained the temper I had for a moment lost \" (which I don't believe, mind, for Miss Ann never lost her temper). \" ' Poor thing ! if she ever wants a woman's counsel, or sympathy, she will always find it if she comes here ; tell her that, too. Will you have another dish of tea, or some straw berries and cream ?' \" Looking up with moist eyes, for a great many feelings and memories were in my heart, I was astonished to see that the Doctor's were full of a strange trouble of some sort, and they were misty, without doubt, and yearning, and altogether unlike Dr. Staynes's usual eyes, so unlike, indeed, that I sat and stared at him in bewilderment. I was still further astonished, when taking no heed of my question about the strawberries, he got up, and said in an agitated way, ' God bless you, madam ! I will tell her ; but a wife is not so much in need of a woman's help as a spinster, and Mademoiselle Rose will be my wife before a fortnight is over her head.'"], [280, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 260 \" Then he sat down, blew his nose, and looked himself again. \" Amazement took away my speech for a full minute. You know the Doctor's age, above forty I should say, the grave professional way he has with him, and his somewhat dry talk and manner, it all takes away any idea of love or marriage in connection with him. And yet here he was talk ing quite rationally of his marriage with Made moiselle Rose in a week as a matter of course ! It really took away my breath. Mademoiselle Rose, the French milliner \u2014 no, not the milliner, but the Frenchwoman \u2014 and Dr. Staynes, the sensible, downright, sober English parish doctor ! Well, after my thoughts had run wild for a full minute I should say, I recovered myself sufficiently to utter a few civil words. I don't know what they were. Commonplace and cold enough, no doubt, but I felt as if I were in a dream, and as I caught his eye, I broke off, ashamed of myself, got up, and held out my hand. ' Forgive me, Doctor, I was too much surprised when you first spoke to express my feelings. I honour and esteem you so much that I feel it incumbent upon me to go to Made moiselle Rose to-morrow, and wish her joy.' \" But the Doctor looked troubled again as I spoke, and he did not smile as I intended he should. On the contrary, his lips trembled a little as he said, his eyes still fixed on me with a curious mixture of expressions in them, \u2014 \" ' I may as well tell you that she has another"], [281, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 261 name. The name by which I shall marry her is Rose Josephine Salterre.' \" I don't know,\" said Miss Ann, as she got thus far in her narrative, \" I don't know what prompted me, at that distance of time, to burst out weeping at the sudden sound of that name, but so it was. \" My poor dear lamb ! My beautiful patient sister ! \" said she, weeping again, \" how could I help it, Deb ? \" \" The Doctor, poor man, did not know what to say or do, so he very wisely said and did nothing. He let me cry. But I did not cry longer than I could help, and when I was quite calm, he got up and bowed as if he were going away. \" I felt too shaken to say much, but there was one question among the many I wished to ask, which I felt must be answered before he left me. '\" What relation \u2014 ' I began, and he did not oblige me to finish it. \" ' A cousin,' he replied. ' Old Monsieur Salterre had a brother, Rose is his daughter.' \" ' Ah,' I said, ' she spoke now and then of her cousins.' \" ' One word, madam,' said the Doctor ; ' may I, or may she come to you to-morrow, and tell you anything you wish to know ? ' \" ' Yes,' I replied, ' that will be best. I own I do not feel equal to much conversation now. I am so surprised \u2014 so startled.' \" I held out my hand. The Doctor, as he took it,"], [282, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 262 looked wistfully at me, with a look I could not understand at the time, and then he said ' Good bye,' and went. \" It occurred to me afterwards that he must have waited for my felicitations, and that I had failed in common courtesy and kindness, in not giving them, and I resolved to make due amends on the morrow. \" The next morning, I sent Nelly to play, instead of keeping her to her lessons as usual, for I felt unsettled, and I could not know for certain when Mademoiselle Rose, or Doctor Staynes, or both, might arrive. I began to employ myself in a hundred ways, and left them all, and was preparing myself, for the twentieth time at least, to read, when Mademoiselle Rose passed the window, \u2014 alone. \" I was very glad that she was alone, and when she entered the room, with a timid, slow step, instead of her usual brisk one, and I saw that her eyes began to fill, my heart warmed to her for her own sake, as well as for the sake of her name. I held out both my hands. \"'Mademoiselle Rose Salterre,' I said, and the little woman impulsively caught one of my hands and kissed it. \" ' Ah ! ' she cried, ' and Mademoiselle is not angry. Dr. Staynes said you would be this morn ing, when you had had time to think. But I said you looked too good.' \" ' Angry ! why, and with whom ? ' I asked. \" ' With him and me,' said Mademoiselle Rose,"], [283, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 263 with a little smile ; ' but there\u2014 he will talk of mesalliances, and I, who am I ? A poor little French dressmaker ! ' \"I began to see what she meant now. The Doctor had thought that if her real name was known to me, I or my family should object to her marrying a man who was so lowly born, as we knew him to be, and should perhaps persuade her against it, with her ignorance of English ways and manners. He fancied, foolish man, that my brother would dislike such a connection; and he had wrought his fears into her. I call him foolish, but I do not know, on reflection, but that he had sufficient grounds to go upon, after all he must have heard from her about by-gone times.\" And Miss Ann gave one of her heavy sighs of long ago. \" I thought of all this, Deborah, or it would be truer to say that it flashed through my mind, and then I looked at the little figure before me, with the eager, French face, and the quaintly-simple dress, and I said, \u2014 \" ' My dear, Dr. Staynes is greatly mistaken. You are no doubt above him in birth, but he is a generous, high-minded man, and should have known us better.' \" ' Thanks, thanks, Mademoiselle ! ' cried the little woman tearfully. 'I love to hear you say so. You have taken such a load from my heart.' And she made a pretty gesture with her hands of flinging something away. And then I made her sit down, and got her to tell me all I wanted to"], [284, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 264 know. The substance of it divested of many interruptions, caused by emotion of different kinds, was that Monsieur Ignace Salterre, brother to my poor sister's father, had lived in the provinces after his wife's death, with his two daughters, Rose, the eldest, and Antoinette, who was eleven years younger than her sister. The family lived in comfort, but not in luxury, like the Parisian banker, and there had never been much inter course between the two, though there seems to have been a strong sentiment of admiration and affection on the part of Rose for her beautiful cousin, who was of course some years older than herself. Her marriage to Herbert, my father's anger, and her subsequent death, made a very painful impression upon them, and, naturally enough, deepened Monsieur Salterre's feeling of dislike to intercourse with English people. When his brother's failure took place, he was involved in the common ruin. He was proud with the pride of a weak mind that could not stand up against misfortune. A sudden illness prostrated him, and he died in a week from the day when the news from Paris arrived. Rose, like many women who, until they are tried, display no particularly heroic qualities, proved a heroine now in the real sense of the word, with courage and wit, and readiness to act, which came out unwittingly in her simple way of telling her story. \" Antoinette was only fourteen, and had been the pet of her father, and the light of her sister's"], [285, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 265 eyes. She was quite a child, and Rose felt that she must part from her for a time in order to carry her own plan into execution. This was to go to England, as she knew many others had done, to make money there by the only talent she possessed, that of needlework, to form a home for her sister, and then, when that home, however humble, was secured, to return to France and fetch her. The terrible part of the scheme to her was not the voyage to England, nor the uncertainty as to what she might be exposed to when she got there, but the parting from Antoinette. It had to be done, however, and it softened the blow to the poor girl that she was able to leave her with an old friend of her father, who, though strict and rigid in her notions, and not likely to be indulgent, was kind and pious, and sincerely interested in both the girls. \"Antoinette provided for, and the lamentable parting over, Mademoiselle Salterre wrote to her uncle to tell him of her intention. She conceived that this step was all that was necessary, and aware that he would object greatly to what she was doing, she awaited no reply, but started for England immediately. She told me very little about her first experiences, which must, I suspect, have been bitter enough. She went to London, and contracted a great dislike to it. Her health failed, and the doctor she consulted told her that she ought to live in country air if possible. She knew, of course, our name, and had heard also in"], [286, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 266 what part of England we lived ; and she made up her mind at once to go there. She had three reasons for this rather rash resolve. The first was that she wanted to see the only place in England which possessed a living interest for her. \" Secondly. Her ignorance. The country to a French girl means a good-sized town, with a promenade and plenty of well-dressed people. She fancied that in such a place she should get full employment, and pass unnoticed. \" Thirdly. She had heard of me. Only think, Deborah ; she knew that I was the only one of my family who had been in the secret of Her bert's marriage, and she said she had a dim hope of some day seeing me, and thanking me for having befriended the dead. Her dismay was great when she saw the place she had come to, but there was no help for it. She could not afford a second move, and so she settled herself down in the dull country village, just as autumn was fading into winter, with a determination and energy worthy of all praise. She refused no work, how ever rough and coarse, that was offered to her, never complained, and hid in her own breast all the disappointment she must have suffered. Think of the want of all society, the weather, the roads, and little daily hardships of all kinds besides ! Poor thing ! I could see that that first month had been very, very hard to bear. From the moment, however, that she made the acquaintance of Dr. Staynes, her lot brightened. She consulted him"], [287, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 267 first about her cough, with a great dread of the expense such a step might bring with it ; and when he repeated his visits, and continued to prescribe for her, she fairly told him that she could not afford a bill, and therefore must decline seeing him any more. She said that he stared with astonish ment (I had not believed the Doctor could be such a Jesuit ! ), and asked her if it were possible she did not know that his first visit only was a pro fessional one, and that the rest were perfectly voluntary on his part, and, as such, had nothing to do with money. What with her ignorance of English habits, and of the English language, Mademoiselle Rose was easily deceived ; and so the acquaintance grew, and deepened into some thing more than an acquaintance on both sides. \" I asked her, when she got so far, why the Doctor, who knew me well, had not told me about her, and why he had seemed so reluctant to mention her name when I asked him about her. She coloured deeply at my question. \" ' / did not wish it at first,' she said ; ' how could I know you would be so good ? I concealed my name, for I could not bear to think that you should fancy I came here to be helped by any of your family. You would have done the same in my place, mademoiselle.' \" I owned that I should. \" ' But,' she went on, ' after I had seen you two or three times, and heard about you from Mrs. Williams, and when he asked me to marry him,"], [288, "268 MY OWN PEOPLE. then I wished you to know. The idea of keeping up a secret was painful to me, for I felt I wanted no help then, and my motives could not be called in question ; but he objected ' and she stopped, colouring again still more deeply. \" ' He thought I, my brother would object,' I said. ' I understand that ; but we had no right.' \" ' That was not all, mademoiselle,' said R.ose. ' I will tell you now, though you will smile.' \" And her simple narration of the jealousy of the Doctor, and of his wish to keep his newly-found possession to himself, and his dislike of her getting known and talked of, nearly did make me smile, though I kept grave, for fear of hurting the feelings of this good Rose. \" For good and brave-hearted she must be,\" said Miss Ann in conclusion : \" a true woman, Deborah, and one who will make a good wife, I feel assured.\" I felt as Miss Ann did, and I was glad to think that Dr. Staynes was going to be so happy, and Mademoiselle Rose too, and I said so. \" And now, Deborah,\" said she to me, with tear ful eyes, \" I must try and do what I can to atone : one member of that family, at least, must \" She broke off. \" We must contrive to make the wedding as bright and festive a one as we can. They had thought of stealing off, as it were, to Keysham (the village on the coast where the poor French lady died) to be married, but it must be here. We must show that we heartily approve the"], [289, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 269 match. I wish I could transport that poor little sister over from France, but that is out of the question ; so Nelly must be the bridesmaid ; she shall help you and me to dress the church with flowers, and she shall give the bride a posy. I will write to my brother, and he shall send her a wedding-gift.\" She looked so bright and young as she spoke, that I felt more strongly than usual how com pletely she lived for the sake of other people, and said so to her, for which she rebuked me. It always pained her if anything was said to her which in the least savoured of praise. Well, the wedding-day came and went, and the old church, which stood close to the Hall, was dressed with flowers, and the churchyard path strewn with lilies ; and the Doctor and his wife \u2014 the former very quiet and grave, the latter beam ing in her lilac-coloured silk and white bonnet \u2014 came and had breakfast and bridecake at the Manor. Just before they started for their wedding-trip, Miss Ann presented Mr. Herbert's wedding-gift of a silver teapot and cream-ewer ; and when they came back at the end of a fortnight she had fur nished the little drawing-room for them, as her own present to them both. There they lived very happily for many years. They never had any children ; but Antoinette came to live with them after a time, and a winning little creature she was, and a nice companion for your mamma. She"], [290, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 270 married a Frenchman afterwards, and went back to her own country. The Doctor died before his wife, and she went to live with Antoinette in her turn ; but I think she got so fond of England that it was a pang to her to leave it. That was no wonder, when the hap piest part of her life was spent here, and she left behind her her husband's grave."], [291, "VIII. \\ X 7E did not hear this chronicle, which follows, \u00bb \u00bb from Nurse, but from Papa. He, know ing that old Deborah was in the habit of telling us family histories from time to time, asked one day if she had ever told us about the rick-burners. When we said \" No,\" he thought a little, and then said that we should go on the river for a long afternoon, some day that week, and that he would tell us the story. This was a great treat to look forward to. We saw so little of papa now, from his constant law business in town, that the idea of a summer day with him all to ourselves was inexpressibly delightful. How we watched the weather, and rejoiced as we heard it prophesied on all sides that it was settled, and likely to remain so ! I remember getting up very early the next morning, to peep out and see if the dawn gave promise of a fine day, and waking Tiny in my glee by singing the old distich, \" Evening red and morning grey,\" &c. The next day, however, was a busy one with papa, so we had to wait, but at last our hopes were fulfilled. Four days after that on which papa"], [292, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 272 had made his promise he came home early, and as soon as it was cool enough to be pleasant, about four o'clock, we crossed Greenwich Park to the river-side, where lay our boat, rowed it some little distance down to the shade of a clump of trees, and there moored it and prepared to enjoy ourselves. We had brought fruit with us, some cake, and a bottle of milk, and Tiny had tried hard to persuade papa that this would do instead of dinner. Papa shook his head at that, but said he should be very glad of it when he had told his story. At the mention of the story we all became quiet. Tiny stopped fidgeting about, and sat down to plait some straw for a hat, Janet got her pencils ready for a sketch, and I took out my work ; but I don't love work, and I soon dropped it in my lap, to watch the gliding water, and the shadows thrown upon it by the trees, which I liked much better. It was such a lovely afternoon that I felt as if it were quite employment enough to look at everything and admire it ; and eager as I had been for the story, I was now glad that papa did not begin immediately. It was towards the end of August, and the air was still and hot. The water was so bright, where it caught the sun, that I could hardly look at it ; but in the shade where our boat lay, it was cool and dark and green with shadows of bank and trees. A willow dipped itself into the water close by, and at its root was a hole in the bank, from which an old trout came"], [293, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 273 out every now and then to have a look at us, dis appearing if we made any remark. On the other side of the river were some swans, belonging to the owner of the villa which stood among the trees just out of sight. A bend of the stream on each side of us shut out everything else, so that we were seemingly as completely alone as if we had been in our own garden. Dragon-flies darted about, fish leaped out of the water close to us, and then disappeared, leaving sparkling circles and eddies behind them ; voices were now and then wafted to us across from the grounds of the villa, or the dash of oars would break the stillness, and a boat would pass swiftly by. But for these occasional sounds, the stillness would have been complete. Blue sky, sparkling water, cool green shade, and hot fragrant air. I have been trying to describe it all, and on reading over what I have written I find I have not done so in the least. How is it, I wonder, that in reading some descrip tions you seem to see the place, or the things, or the people described, as clearly as if they were before your bodily eyes ? Is it because some people see more than others, or that they know more words by which to tell what they see, or that they have a knack of putting the words into better order, or what ? I do not know, only I feel that I have failed in producing what I wished, and that I do not know how to do it better, and must there fore leave it alone. I said that papa did not immediately begin his T"], [294, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 274 story. He made so long a pause indeed, sitting at the end of the boat, and gazing into the water, that Janet looked up at him for a moment with inquiring eyes, and Tiny made a little half impatient sound which he did not hear ; but Janet silenced her by a glance, and a movement of her finger to her lips ; and we all sat still, for we felt, at least I know I did, that papa was thinking of something with which we had nothing to do. Perhaps it was the story he meant to tell us, and if so, I feared it would be a sad one, like so many of the rest, for his face was not exactly sad, but very, very grave and still ; and he looked as if he were far away from us and the present time. We waited patiently, and at last he looked up and smiled at Tiny, who was watching him. The look and the smile were a kind of relief, and I felt that I might ask for the story. \" The story ? Yes, Mab, you shall have it. I have been thinking some of it over again.\" And he sighed and moved away from his seat, and came and sat by me. \" Papa,\" said Janet suddenly, \" don't tell us if\u2014 if you don't wish, I mean. You look tired.\" Papa smiled very fondly at her. \" You think it will be painful to me to look back, but you are wrong, my child ; it will be pleasant.\" And without any more delay he began. \" I am going to talk of a long time ago\u2014thirty five years.\""], [295, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 275 \" Dear me ! \" broke in Tiny, \" that is nothing ; is it, Mab ? Nursie talks of things that happened double that time ago, as if it were yesterday. But go on, please, papa.\" \" I will, if you don't interrupt me. Thirty-five years ago, when your mother was a girl of nine teen, and I had not seen her, she lived, as you know, at the Hall with her father and her brother : your Uncle Arthur was some few years younger than she was.\" \" Yes, and Aunt Ann lived at the Manor and taught her,\" said Tiny. \" Oh ! Tiny, do be quiet,\" entreated I ; and Tiny shut up her mouth very tightly, as if she was de termined not to speak again, and papa went on. \" My father was a London physician, as you know too, and an old acquaintance of your mother's father : he had attended his second wife.\" This time Tiny looked at me, nodded her head several times, unpursed her lips, made a move ment with them which was intended to represent the words, \" Miss Letitia,\" and then shut them up as tightly as before. \" I was my father's only child. My mother had died when I was born, so that he and I lived to-. gether in closer and more loving intimacy than most fathers and sons. He had ceased taking any very active part in his profession at the time I am telling you of. \" I was at Cambridge, studying for the law, and had just come home for the winter vacation, when"], [296, "276 MY OWN PEOPLE. my father one morning received a letter from Mr. Stirling, asking him to go down to the Hall. The letter said that the invitation was given, not only on account of a strong desire on the part of your grandfather to renew a friendship which had been so long interrupted, but also because Miss Stirling (' Aunt Ann,' you know, Tiny) was out of health, and he was uneasy about her, and wished for a second medical opinion. My father wrote in reply that he would gladly come and see Miss Stirling, if his friend wished it, but that he could not con sent to pay any prolonged visit then, for that I was with him, and my visits at home would neces sarily become shorter and fewer when I once entered upon my profession. This letter was fol lowed by another, containing a very kind and courteous invitation to me to accompany my father. We left London accordingly, very early the following morning, and arrived at the Hall at the close of the second afternoon, just as it was getting too dark for me to see more than the out line of the fine old house. \" Coming events do not always cast their sha dows before, for I well remember looking forward with no great pleasure to the visit ; and as we journeyed along, feeling the cold in spite of our wraps, I said to my father that I thought it a great stretch of friendship on his part, to put himself to the inconvenience of such a long journey in the winter, and that it would be an interruption to all our usual pursuits and intercourse. My father"], [297, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 277 answered by telling me as much as he knew of Mr. Stirling's past history, adding that he had remained absent from home, and isolated from every one, even his children, for so long, that his wish to renew an old acquaintance was a healthy sign which he could by no means regret. Now I knew enough of my father to be sure that he did feel the journey to be a trying one, and the stop page to our quiet home life together, vexatious ; but I also knew that he never let personal con siderations weigh with him when he thought he could do anybody good, so I felt ashamed of my petulance, though I could not attain to any feeling of satisfaction throughout the day. \" Mr. Stirling's reception of us did not greatly alter my views. He was a very fine-looking man, about fifty years old, and perfectly courteous and high-bred ; but though his face, which was a very melancholy one, brightened at the sight of my father, the expression soon faded, and there was a certain look of absorption and absence, and I fancied of hauteur, which was not attractive to me. I was a very young man, and had never seen the face before it was so clouded, and did not realise, as my father did, the deep grief which had wrought such a change in it. I do not suppose a melancholy face is ever very attractive to the young and eager. \" When dinner, which was served in a small room hung with stamped brown leather, instead of paper, was over, my father asked after his children."], [298, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 278 \" ' They are very well, thank you,' was the answer, in a languid tone which was almost indif ferent. Then he roused himself and said, \" ' My daughter is with her aunt, down at the Manor, but I will send for Arthur.' \" The boy appeared in a few minutes, a tall, open faced lad about fourteen, at the age when awkward shyness is the chief thing to be noticed in a boy before strangers. I observed with surprise, that he seemed as shy and tongue-tied with his father, as he did with us, until I remembered that they must know very little of each other, for Mr. Stir ling had not returned home many months from his long wanderings. Not but what he had often been to the Hall from time to time, but Arthur had lately always been at school during his short visits, and before that he was too young to recollect much, and probably only had visions of a tall, serious man, whom he looked upon with more awe than affection. I tried to talk to him, and to make him talk to me, but I got little more than mono syllables in reply, and I could see the most un feigned relief shine over his face when his father told him he might go. The evening was rather dreary, and I retired early, leaving my father and Mr. Stirling together. My father told me after wards, that they had sat up till nearly midnight, talking as only old friends after a long separation can do. He told me that Mr. Stirling had owned himself wrong in having given way to his sorrow, and had mourned over the estrangement of his"], [299, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 279 children, which he seemed to accept as a thing that could not now be cured. \" ' My daughter,' said he, ' is wrapped up in her aunt, and is never away from her when she can help it, and Arthur is, I do believe, happier with Deborah Standish, his former nurse, than he is with me.' \" This was natural enough, my father thought, and said so, and added something in his downright way about Mr. Stirling's listlessness and morbid depression having become a habit, to be overcome, if he wished his children to know and love him. Something too, he added, about Christian submis sion being cheerful, and more than a dull resigna tion, to which Mr. Stirling listened, but made no reply. \" They talked, as I have said, for a long time, and when my father came up to his bedroom, which opened out of mine, he sat upon the edge of my bed and said, ' He wants a tonic, my boy. A cold douche and a good wholesome bitter. Poor dear fellow ! ' \" ' In this weather ! ' I said sleepily, as I involun tarily pulled the clothes closer round me. \" My father laughed. ' Yes, in this weather. I'm glad I came, very glad. Good night.' And my father left me to dream of poor Mr. Stirling undergoing a system of cold bathing and camo mile tea. \" The next day I saw what my father had meant"], [300, "280 MY OWN PEOPLE. by the cold douche and the bitter tonic. He pro posed, directly after breakfast, that he and Mr. Stirling should see the medical man who was attending Miss Stirling. The squire hesitated, and then said that he had not mentioned my father's name to him. \" ' But, my dear sir,' said my father, ' you must do so, or I cannot possibly see your sister ; where does the Doctor live ? Can we not walk and call upon him, this fine frosty morning ? ' \" I saw Mr. Stirling look at the fire, and the weekly newspaper, which had been delayed some days over its time, and had just arrived. My father saw it too, but would not notice it, and went on \u2014 \" ' What a pleasure to be able to walk in such a glorious country ! It puts me in mind of old country days. Your boy is out, I dare say. Ah ! there he is, with the dogs. What a fine fellow, Stirling ! May he come with us ? ' \" Mr. Stirling had nothing to do but to submit, and we all set out together for Dr. Staynes's house. \" He was an elderly man, with clever eyes, and a little French wife younger than himself.\" \" Oh papa, papa ! \" said the irrepressible Tiny, \"we know all about her and her history; such a pretty one ! \" \" Well,\" said papa ; \" perhaps you know, then, that your Uncle Arthur was quite at home there, and very fond of Mrs. Staynes.\""], [301, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 281 \"No,\" said Tiny and I together; \"we don't know that; but was Antoinette there ? \" \"Yes, but I did not see her on that occasion.\" \" My father found the Doctor very courteous, and ready to assent to Mr. Stirling's proposal that he should see Miss Stirling ; indeed, my father's name was one that stood too high in the medical profes sion for any one to feel otherwise than honoured at acting with him. \" As we walked down the hill together, having left Arthur with Mrs. Staynes, the conversation turned upon the rick-burnings that were so frequent all over the country, and upon the disturbed state of feeling which led to them. Mr. Stirling remarked that he knew very little about the state of feeling in the agricultural districts, and asked many questions with more appearance of interest than he had shown since our arrival. While my father and he talked, I was more en gaged in admiring the country than in listening. To a town-bred youth, such as I was, knowing only London, and flat, fenny Cambridgeshire, the Downs, pearly grey in the sunny morning air, the stee p broken ground, the moss-covered oaks, the sweeping beeches, were all enchanting, and as we came near the Manor, a low red-brick house, with a warm, old-world look about it, and a graceful figure of a girl standing in the door-way, I almost thought it a dissolving view which must pass away, leaving nothing but recollec tion behind it. The figure in the doorway, look-"], [302, "282 MY OWN PEOPLE. ing so anxiously up the road towards us, was your mother.\" Papa made a short pause, and then went on. \" My father and Mr. Stirling went up-stairs, led by your mother, who was evidently quite absorbed in anxiety for her aunt, and I was left alone, feeling very much in the way, and after a time I strolled out into the garden. I had not been there many minutes, and was standing by the sun-dial, ad miring the icicles which had formed upon its edge in the night, and were slowly dissolving under the morning sun, when this young girl, of whom I had had but that first glance, joined me. \" ' Papa has sent me down to you,' she said, in a gentle, rather sad voice, ' to ask if you would prefer waiting, or going back to the Hall ? ' \" I felt more in the way than ever, thanked her, and said I would go back, and then made some civil inquiry about Miss Stirling. \" 'Very ill,' she said, in a still sadder tone. ' I am so glad your father is come ; he is very clever, is he not ? ' \" ' Yes, very clever,' I replied ; and I think I foolishly added something about being well able to judge, never having been separated from him for any length of time, for I recollect she looked at me earnestly and sighed, as we shook hands and parted. I went home with a strange new feeling stirring at my heart. Arthur came bounding down the hill as I got to the park gate, and we spent the rest of the morning together in the"], [303, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 283 stable and kennel and farm-yard, but I saw the look and heard the sigh through it all. The boy's constraint and shyness soon wore off with me, and we became capital friends. We had some skating in the afternoon, and Mr. Stirling promised us some shooting on the following day, and I began to think that my visit would prove a pleasant one after all. My father did not take a gloomy view of Miss Stirling's illness, but agreed with Dr. Staynes, that she must be kept extremely quiet, and that any shock to her nerves might be dangerous, if not fatal, in her weak state.\" \" Two days passed, and I did not see Nelly again, as I had hoped. Once, after a visit to the Manor, my father spoke to me of her excessive devotion to her aunt, and of the quiet way in which she took her directions and carried them out, remarking that he was sure that under the sad, gentle manner lay a mine of energy and determination which only wanted an opportunity to sparkle up into life. We little thought then, either of us, how soon those qualities were to be brought into exercise. \" You have often heard me speak of the machine breaking and rick-burning mania which spread and grew in England at the time I am speaking of. The former died out as soon as the people learnt to see that the machines did them more good than harm. The latter was so easy of accomplishment, and detection was so difficult, that when wages were low or bread dear, as was the case now, it"], [304, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 284 broke out again. Small bands of men went about under cover of the darkness, and stacks were seen burning night after night, to the great terror of the timid and the unprotected. \"When we had been at the Hall a week, it was whispered about that the rick-burners were not far off, and that we might expect a visit from them before long. Precautions were taken, and men set to watch all night round the Hail premises, chiefly through my father's persuasion, for the squire was inclined to treat the whole matter very lightly. It was on that account, I suppose, that no measures were taken at the Manor, which was one of the smallest, but at the same time one of the best farms, on the estate. I wondered afterwards that none of us, and more especially my father, should have considered the danger to Miss Stir ling, of a sudden fright or night attack. Arthur and I used to go the round of the Hall premises soon after dark, see that the men were at their posts, and had hot beer served out to them. The boy was in a high state of delight, and I myself felt that the excitement and spice of danger were very pleasant. Several nights passed quite quietly, however, and it was rumoured on one hand that the men had dispersed ; on the other, that they had gone in an opposite direction. I suspect that although the watchers were ready enough to come for the sake of the extra wages they got, and the beer, they relaxed their watch considerably when they found that night after night passed without"], [305, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 285 any attack, and I dare say they had a fellow feeling too, with the aggressors, and were not dis posed to be very vigorous in the performance of their duty. The surprise which really came upon us could be accounted for in no other way. \" It was a week after the watch had first been set, and the novelty of the thing had worn off, so that we had almost ceased to think or talk of the rick- burners. I had been with Arthur down to a piece of marshy land on the extreme edge of the estate, to look for a snipe, and we set out on our return about four o'clock in the afternoon, when it was already growing dark. Since my arrival, Arthur had been allowed to carry a gun and use it, and this afternoon he had shot a landrail, and was in such a hurry to carry it home and announce his triumph, that he took a short cut to the Hall, followed by the keeper, who had orders not to let him out of his sight. I had promised my father to inquire at the Manor on my return, and as the short way chosen by Arthur did not pass by the house, I took the ordinary road alone. I recollect the road rang under my feet like hard metal, as I walked along, and my breath steamed out in the frosty air. The way was for the most part lonely, but now and then a cottage gave forth a glimmer of fire, which blinked and shone cheerily through the uncurtained window, and I met two or three labourers going home from their work, who, how ever, did not give me the cordial ' good night,' in answer to my salutation, which I was told they"], [306, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 286 would have done in more prosperous times. But this troubled me very little. I was fresh from a day's successful shooting, cold-footed, and very hungry it is true, but I was going home to a warm house and a good dinner, and perhaps, too, I was to have a glimpse of the young lady at the Manor, and a few words from her as I went. I was not insensible either to the peculiar effect of the melt ing grey in the sky ; I admired the sharp outline of the Downs in front of me, the elasticity of the air had an exhilarating effect upon my whole frame, and my eyes sought eagerly the dim, dark shapes of the trees which lined one side of the road with their half-shrouded forms of beauty. I walked on quickly, with a sense of glowing pleasure in the mere fact of walking. In half-an-hour I reached the Manor, and rang the bell gently, for fear the invalid should be sleeping. To my surprise, the door was opened almost before the sound of the bell had ceased, by Nelly herself. Her start as she saw me and her white face told me there was something wrong. She laid her finger on her lips, and in a whisper asked me to come in. \" ' Do you want my father ? ' I asked, as I followed her into the parlour. ' I can fetch him in a quarter of an hour. Is Miss Stirling worse ? ' \" She did not answer till she had carefully shut the door of the room. Then she said, ' No, my aunt is better, she is asleep : ' and then with a little quiver of the lip, which her smile did not hide,"], [307, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 287 'I suppose I am nervous; I am afraid of the rioters. Do you think they will come here ? ' \" ' No, indeed,' I said, ' I do not think they will.' And then I told her of the report, which seemed to be well founded, that they had gone elsewhere, and how her father and mine thought all danger was over. \"She listened eagerly, with some returning colour in her face, and I wondered for a moment at her evident alarm. It hardly seemed consistent with my father's account of her steady courage. But her next words explained it. \" ' If they were to come, and my aunt were to know, it would kill her, in her nervous state.' \" She sat with her hands clasped on her lap, and her eyes fixed on me as she said this, as if to entreat me to say something more to re-assure her. \" ' Miss Stirling,' I began eagerly \u2014 and then I stopped. I had been going to offer to remain there for the night, but I recollected in time that I was all but a stranger, and that there might be some impropriety in my offer. I changed the sentence, and said I was sure Mr. Stirling would send a man down to watch, if she wished. \" ' No, no,' she replied, ' I don't wish that. The servants are so easily frightened, and if a man came they would be sure to fancy something was going to happen this very night. That may be so, I feel as if it were, but they would never keep quiet, and Aunt Ann would find it out. I wish Deborah were here, I should feel safer then.'"], [308, "288 MY OWN PEOPLE. \"'A woman could hardly do any real good,' I said. ' She could not stop the men from firing the ricks.' \" ' No,' said Nelly, ' but she is so wise and help ful. You don't know her. I do believe she could almost do it by speaking to them.' \" I thought again, and another alternative sug gested itself. ' My father might come,' I said, ' and the servants would think nothing of that. They would only fancy Miss Stirling was worse, and that he wanted to be at hand to watch her ; and I dare say he could bring Deborah too, if it would be a comfort to you.' \" She brightened very much at this, and gave a sigh of relief. \" ' Oh, Mr. Harrington ' she said, ' do you think he would ? But it is too much,\u2014 in this cold, too \u2014 I don't like to ask him.' \" ' But I will ask him,' I said ; ' he will come, I know. Will you have Deborah too ? ' \" ' No, no. I shall feel quite happy, quite safe with your father,' and she got up as if nervously eager that I should go at once, at which I felt a little mortified. \" ' I will engage that he will be here in an hour,' 1 said, opening the door. ' No one who had evil designs would think of coming before nine or ten, and it is now hardly half-past four.' \" We shook hands. She stole away up-stairs, and I let myself out of the house, and ran all the rest of the way to the Hall."], [309, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 289 \"My father was with Mr. Stirling when I arrived, and I at once went to them and told my story. \" ' The silly girl ! ' said Mr. Stirling ; ' you can't possibly go down there at this time of night. I'll send a man. It's all nonsense, you know.' \" I looked anxiously at my father. \" ' I have answered for you, sir,' I whispered \" ' It's not all nonsense, Stirling,' said he. ' The fact is, Miss Nelly has been nursing and watching a little too much of late. Not but what she is brave and strong enough to bear a good deal, but nerves play the best of us tricks sometimes ; and hers are just a little overstrained. I'll go.' \" ' But you must dine first.' \" ' Well, yes, I'll dine. I can't fast now as I could ; and nothing can happen, even supposing it were likely, so early.' \" So it was settled. Mr. Stirling ordered the car riage, which my father laughed at and declined. We made a hurried dinner, and Mr. Stirling and I, for the first time, sat down to spend the evening alone together. \" I was nervous and ill at ease. Not on account of my host, who had brightened considerably since the beginning of our visit, and who was, I think, pleased at the interest I showed in his son, and inclined to like me in consequence, but on account of Nelly. As often as we got into conversation about Arthur's prowess in shooting, or Mr. Stir ling's own travels, which had been more varied and extensive than those of most non-military men TJ"], [310, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 290 then, her pale face came before me and I fell into silence. How I longed to be with her ! encourag ing her to forget her fears, or if there really was danger , but that thought was insupportable during my forced inaction, and I would not enter tain it. \" Mr. Stirling was more inclined to talk than usual, and yet the evening was the slowest and most wearisome one I ever spent. Now and then, in an interval of conversation, I ventured to sug gest that there might be disturbances going on at the Manor, of which we at the Hall could know nothing ; but my host smiled at my remarks in a way which made me feel as if I had said some thing very foolish, and effectually closed my mouth. \" Nine o'clock struck, and supper was announced. I made a last effort. ' My father,' I said, ' is getting old, and I own I am a little anxious about him. I am told some of these men are desperate enough, and should there be any real ground for Miss Nelly's fears ' \" ' Which there is not,' remarked Mr. Stirling. \" ' Still, if you will allow me,' I insisted, ' I will run down and see that all is quiet. I would rather do it than go in to supper.' \" I waited in some trepidation for what Mr. Stir ling should say, for though I was resolved to have my own way, I was too young not to be keenly alive to ridicule, and I felt, also, that what I said was not altogether perfectly ingenuous. \"His answer was stopped by the door being"], [311, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 291 opened suddenly and quickly, and Deborah Stand ish coming into the room. \" It was the first time I had seen her, or observed her closely, and I recollect being greatly struck with her open, pleasant face and vigorous expression; and feeling, in some indistinct way, that there was a great deal of power about her, and a great deal of courage and honesty too. She looked eager and flushed, and had her bonnet and shawl on, and she breathed quickly, as if she had just come in from a walk. \" She went straight up to Mr. Stirling, and said shortly, \" ' She is quite safe, sleeping like a lamb ; and so are they all, thank God ! ' \" ' She \u2014 they ! Whom are you talking of, De borah ; and what do you mean ? ' said Mr. Stirling. \" The truth must have flashed upon him, as it did upon me, but he refused to recognise it, and I did not dare to ask the question which was on my lips. \" ' Miss Ann, sir, to be sure,' said Deborah with a gasp. ' Those rick-burners have been at it down at the Manor, and it's thanks to Miss Nelly only that she knows nothing of it, and never will.' \" ' Miss Nelly ! ' we both echoed ; but I can recall so perfectly all that was said during the next half hour, that I will tell you the story in Deborah's own words, as I think I can. \"I could not sit still, sir, when I heard Dr."], [312, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 292 Harrington had gone down to the Manor. I knew Miss Ann was better, for I had been there myself in the morning, and I could not see any reason why the Doctor should go at that hour unless Miss Nelly had sent for him. The child has had over nursing and over-anxiety of late, and has been shut up in the house too much ; and though I can't blame her for not leaving her aunt, for it's only right that one angel should nurse another, it has gone to my heart many a time to see her pale looks, and I went down to-day to try and tempt her out a bit, but she would not listen. Well, I suspected that something was wrong, and I was fidgety over my needle-work, and instead of going downstairs went and sat in the gallery bed room, where I could see over towards the Manor. There came into my mind as I sat, the story about the poor lady over at Glatton, you know, sir, who died with her three days' old babe from fright, at seeing the glare of the flames through her window. I watched and watched, expecting every moment to see the fire shoot up in the darkness, but nothing came. I heard Master Arthur come up-stairs to bed and call for me, but I would not answer, for 1 had determined to go myself to the Manor to ease my mind; and I knew he would ask ques tions, and if he found out where I was going he would want to go too. So I sat quietly until I heard his whistling and singing stop, and I knew he must be in bed, and then I went to him to bid him ' good night,' and to ask if he had remembered"], [313, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 293 his prayers. I have never missed that, sir, since the day I gave up putting him to bed with my own hands. \" I glanced at the squire as Deborah said this, and saw that he was much moved ; but he said nothing, and she proceeded. \" He asked me where I had been, and wanted to tell me all about his shooting, but I could not listen then, so I made believe to think he was tired, and must go to sleep as fast as possible. \" ' Oh Nurse, how tiresome you are to-night ! ' he said, ' I'm not a bit sleepy.' But he was asleep before I was out of the house. I got the lantern, for it was pitch-dark, and made all the haste I could down the road to the Manor, for a sudden dread had fallen upon me for which I could not account. I did not hear a sound or meet a creature, and when I got to the house all was still. I would not go to the front door for fear of making a noise, but went through the garden, intending to go in by the kitchen. As I crept round by the left side of the house, where the holly hedge sepa rates the garden from the farm-yard, I thought I heard the sound of men's voices talking together in whispers, and I ran down the garden to the little gate which leads into the yard. \" I covered my lantern with my cloak, and strained my eyes into the darkness, and by-and by, as they got accustomed to the gloom, I made out a white figure, which flitted across the yard very near to the gate where I stood, and which"], [314, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 294 I felt sure was no man but a woman. I was very much relieved. ' One of the maids out here at this time of night!' I thought, 'there must be a cow or a calf ill ; what a goose I am ! ' I was just going to uncover my lantern when the light of one suddenly shone nearly upon me, and made me start back into the shade, and to my surprise and terror I saw the figures of several men in a group close to the cow-shed, and, standing with her back against the shed, and her face turned to the men, was Miss Nelly. \" The light of the lantern which was carried by one of them was now turned upon her, and dim as it was, I could see that her face was as white as her dress, but very set-looking and determined. I had never seen her with such a look before, and it put me in mind of poor Miss Charlotte for a moment. Well, I stood there and never stirred, but waited to see what would happen before I dared go for help. I wonder now at myself, for I never thought about the cold, and her standing there exposed to it, with only a shawl over her white dress ; I only saw that look in her face and wondered what it meant. \" She had been speaking to the men before I came up, I suppose, which was what I had heard; and after a silence which might have lasted a quarter of a minute, she spoke again, very distinctly, and not a shake in her voice. \" ' You say your wages are too low, because bread is so dear, and yet you are going to burn the wheat"], [315, ""], [316, ""], [317, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 295 and make it still dearer. Why don't you go to the squire and tell him fairly in broad daylight, instead of creeping out in the dark to do a cowardly deed ? It is not like Englishmen ! ' \"There was a murmur at this, but no one spoke. \" Miss Nelly stopped for a few seconds and then went on. ' Why don't you go to my father ? ' she repeated. '\"We don't know nothing about him,' said one man at last. 'Why don't he come and see us? He's always away in foreign parts, so folks say, and don't care if his own people starve at home.' '\"That is not true,' said my darling indignantly. ' He is at the Hall now \u2014 living there ; and he will hear you, I know. He went away because he had a great, great sorrow, and he could not bear to stay ; but he will not go away again, and he cares very much about you all.' \" As Deborah said this I saw the squire's lips tremble, and his eyes grow misty. She went rapidly on. \"My lamb stopped again and looked up to Miss Ann's window, where a light was burn ing. There was a shuffling and whispering among the men. As far as I could make out they were trying to push one of their number forward as spokesman, and the man was unwilling. I tried to distinguish their faces, for I knew most of the men about, and I had not recognised the voice of the one who had already spoken. But the single lantern gave such a dim, wavering light, that I"], [318, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 296 could not see any one clearly, and I dared not show my own, lest I should do harm by my appearance, for Miss Nelly had clearly made an impression on them. At last one of the men was induced to go forward, and he stood awkwardly enough before Miss Nelly, who never once moved, but remained in her former attitude, with her back against the cow-shed, her head held very upright, and her eyes looking straight into the men's faces. They now looked as steadily at the spokesman, who was a stranger to me. \" ' We don't want to do you any harm, miss,' he said a little sulkily. He never looked at her, but kept his eyes down, as well he might. \" ' It is not me,' she interrupted with impatient scorn in her voice, such as I never heard before, and which again reminded me of Miss Charlotte. ' I have told you that my aunt lies ill there,' she pointed to the window. ' Any noise, the sudden glare of a light across her window would wake her, and such a waking would be fatal.

If you are Cobden men, you all know well enough that she would not hurt a hair of your heads.' \" Silence again. The men were evidently ashamed of their errand, and did not know how to reply ; but another man, who had been standing behind the rest, now came forward."], [319, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 297 You and she are safe enough from any harm,' he said. ' I know Miss Ann, and if I'd known it was her as was so ill, horses should not have dragged me here to-night. She saved my Sukey's life'. \" I knew that voice. It was Tobias Drove, the blacksmith. \" ' God bless you ! ' said Miss Nelly at this, with a sudden change in her voice ; and she held out her hand. ' If you know my aunt, you know me. Will you shake hands ? ' \" ' Yes, and welcome,' was the answer. ' I'm sorry to have frighted you, miss, and so are we all.' \" ' You're a brave lass, whoever you are,' said another voice, ' and we'll give you a cheer before we go.' \" ' No, no, no ! ' cried Miss Nelly in terror. ' You will waken her. Thank you all. I will tell my father how good you have been. Pray go away quietly.' \"'That they shall,' said Drove again. 'I'll answer for them, miss. Come on, men ! ' and the men slunk out of the yard without a word, and I could hear their tramp as they went down the road. \" Miss Nelly stood still where she was till the sound of their footsteps had died away, and then made a movement as if to come towards the little gate where I stood ; but she tottered and laid hold of the wall against which she had been leaning,"], [320, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 298 and I opened the gate and said softly, 'Miss Nelly, my darling ! it is Nurse ! ' She gave a little scream, came forwards, and fell against me. She was not in a faint, but only so cold and trembling that she could not stand. \" ' Oh Deborah ! ' was all she said as she clung to me. ' Oh Deborah ! are they gone ? ' \" ' Yes, dear, all gone,' I said, wrapping my cloak round her, ' the false-hearted cowards ! Come in now, you'll catch your death of cold ! ' and I fairly lifted her up and carried her into the house like a baby, the dear, brave lamb ! (and Deborah gave a sob and sat down). \" Mr. Stirling went into the next room, brought her a glass of wine, and said impatiently, ' Go on. How is she ? Nelly, I mean ; and how is my sister ? ' \" ' Sleeping as quietly as a child,' was the an swer ; ' and Miss Nelly is better and in her warm bed ; but what with the cold and the fright, if she is not ill, it will be a miracle. Her courage has all gone out of her now, poor dear, and I'm going down there for the night to see after her.' \" ' And does my father know nothing of it ? ' I said. \" ' He did not till I called him out of Miss Ann's room and told him. It was he who sent me here to say that he would do all that was required. I left him with Miss Nelly, and the cook was making a warm posset for her according to his orders. It seems that he had sent her to bed when he arrived,"], [321, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 299 and had said he would himself sit up with Miss Ann ; and that Miss Nelly saw a light in the yard from her own window, stole down-stairs, and went out, taking care that none should see her, for fear the Doctor should know, and leave Miss Ann.' \" ' Her mother would have done the same,' said the squire, his eyes full of tears. \" ' That she would, sir,' said Deborah fervently. \" ' And now I will go, if you please.' \" ' Yes, go, and say that we shall come down the first thing to-morrow morning. God bless you, Deborah ! it is not the first time I have had to say that to you from my heart,' and Mr. Stirling's voice was fairly choked, while Deborah turned away hastily and left the room. \"We neither of us spoke when we were left alone ; we were both too much moved. I could see that to the squire, who had never known his daughter, this unexpected revelation of her cha racter was at once touching and startling. I re joiced to feel that he would now value and cherish her, as she deserved to be valued and cherished ; but my joy arose not so much from the sunshine it would give to the father's life, as from the remem brance of the sigh and wistful look of the daughter, which had told me, the first day I saw her, how she yearned for such an affection, and pined under the want of it. My mind reverted to that first meeting only ten days before, and I found myself wondering whether I could ever go back contentedly to London and Cambridge, with-"], [322, "3oo MY OWN PEOPLE. out any certain prospect of seeing her again. I must have known her all my life, I thought, without being aware of it ; it could not be only ten days since I had first seen her; that was all a mistake and a dream. \" I was roused out of these vague fancies and sensations by Mr. Stirling wishing me good night, and I was glad to be alone, to think uninter ruptedly, as I said to myself, but in reality to fall into a deep sleep the moment I lay down, caused, no doubt, by the excitement of the few preceding hours. \"The next morning Mr. Stirling was the first in the breakfast-parlour, looking more cheerful and alert than I had yet seen him. The tonic my father had talked about had come to him in an unexpected shape, and was already working his cure. Arthur had had his breakfast, and was away after rabbits, having heard nothing of the affair of the night before, and as soon as breakfast was over we went down to the Manor. \" No one was stirring but Deborah, who gave us the good news that Miss Stirling had awoke much better for her good night ; and that Nelly was fast asleep, with no signs of cold or fever about her. My father was not yet up, and Mr. Stirling, to my great surprise, said that he had business at Cobden, and would return to the Manor when he had accomplished it. I guessed that he meant to go and see for himself what reason there was for the men's complaints, and that his conscience was"], [323, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 301 beginning to tell him he had not cared so very much about his people as Nelly had innocently asserted for him the night before. He went off with a quick, firm step, and I went softly up to my father's room, to sit and watch till he should wake.\" Papa paused here, and then said \u2014 \" There is not much more to tell. Our visit came to an end two days afterwards. Your mother did not suffer so much as had been feared, from her night adventure and the strain upon her nerves, but she was delicate enough, for some time after, to require care and change of air. When Miss Stir ling was well enough to be left, her father took her away with him ; and when the following summer we again visited the Hall it was easy to see that the most thorough love and confidence existed between father and daughter. He was cheerful, healthful-looking, and genial. She was no longer a pale, grave girl, with wistful eyes, but a bright, happy creature, full, notwithstanding, of the serene, gentle grace which had always distin guished her. \" It was then that I ventured to own, first to myself, then to my father, and lastly to her, that I loved her, though five years passed before we married.\" \" Why, papa ? \" I asked softly. \" Because she would not leave her aunt, whose life was bound up in hers, and whose health was failing again, slowly but surely. Because she was"], [324, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 302 too noble-hearted, my Mabel, to take away from one who had been the truest and best of mothers to her, the daily companionship, the gentle care, and the tender attention which no one else could have rendered. Because your aunt was so un selfish, so entirely self- abnegating, that had she known the state of affairs, she would have been miserable till she had given up her darling. Because, too, she felt that her father would miss her sorely, just as he had got to know and love her. So we waited, and were happy in waiting. Waited till your aunt gradually faded away from her long, loving life on earth, to enter upon a longer, more loving life in heaven.\" Papa came to a full stop here, as he had done when he first began his story. He sat silently looking through the interlacing boughs overhead, to the blue, gleaming sky. His dear face was untroubled ; almost glad in its expression.

We knew it yesterday, and we have two days in which to pack and prepare. Uncle Arthur has often asked us before, and when Janet was a little baby, papa and mamma went there with her. But when they went again we were left at home with Deborah, for mamma did not think it good for little girls to be taken out visiting, and after she died papa never left home. Now, however, he says he is glad to go, and we ! \u2014 we are enchanted. It is a dream coming true, which is what dreams hardly ever do except in story-books. I seem to know every room in the old house, every hole and corner outside and in ; and then there is the village, and the house where Dr. and Airs. Staynes used to live, and the road lined with beeches, and above all, the Manor. And we shall see our Cousin Geoffrey Allworthy, who does not live very far off; and the young Dugdales are to be at the Hall to meet us. Deborah used to say that no pleasure could be"], [326, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 304 quite perfect in this world ; \" no rose without a thorn,\" was a favourite saying of hers. I wonder where it is, for this rose seems to me so very perfect. July 6th. \u2014 I have found out the thorn already. It is Deborah herself, or rather the loss of her, though she would not like to be called a thorn either. But I do miss her dreadfully, for I have had to pack for myself, and see after all my things, and I am not at all handy at it. I dare say she spoilt me, and did a great deal too much for me. Papa says so, but it was very pleasant notwith standing ; and I could not help crying a little this morning when I found that I had not folded my things properly, and Janet said I must do it all over again. Dear Nursie ! How happy she would have been if she had known we were going to the Hall, the place she loved better than any other in the world ! And if she could have gone herself ! But perhaps that would have been too painful when nearly every one she knew is gone or dead. Still if she had only known about us ! But perhaps she does know. I think our visit may do for a chronicle; so I mean to keep a journal of what happens every day, if I can, and then, when we come back, Janet will look it over, and tell me if it will do for my book."], [327, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 305 July \u25a0jth.\u2014The Hall. I have written the date, and now I hardly know what to say, though I must write something before I go to bed, just to make myself feel sure that we really are here. I think I am a little \u2014 just a little, disappointed. Not with the journey, nor with the outside of the house, nor with Uncle Arthur, whom I remember. What is it, then ? It must be the inside of the house, and yet that is as pretty and comfortable as it can be. But somehow it looks like a modern house. The drawing-room to-night was all wax candles, and bright, pretty chintz; and this room, where Janet and I are to sleep, is not a bit old-fashioned, like Nurse's stories. I have been so accustomed to see the Hall in my mind's eye as it was when my great aunts lived there as young girls, and to think ot the brown parlour, the still-room, with its lavender and roses laid out to dry, the yew-hedge and straight grass walks in the garden, and my aunts themselves in their chintz-patterned gowns and ruffles, moving about in it, that it is a kind of shock to find everything so modern-looking. But I have only seen two rooms after all, for we came very late, and there must be a great deal that I shall recognise to-morrow, so I will say no more about my disappointment, which looks greater than it really is, now I have put it upon paper. July 8th.\u2014 How foolish of me to write down first impressions so soon ! Here I am ready to tear out the last leaf, now that I have spent a whole x"], [328, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 306 day at this lovely place, and seen it by daylight. And something has happened, too, so that I really have a good deal to write in my journal to-night. In the first place Uncle Arthur has added four rooms to the house, and our bedroom is one of them, which is the reason it is so modern-looking. But when we came down to breakfast this morn ing, we had to cross the hall to the breakfast room, and then I knew where we were at once. Deborah had so often told us of the oak hall, with the long window on one side filled with lozenge shaped panes, the two men in armour at one end, and the gallery at the other, that I knew it by heart, and then breakfast was laid in the brown parlour ! It is such a pleasant room, with leather-hung walls, a gothic window, which was open towards the flower-garden, and many portraits. One over the mantelshelf was of a lady in a shepherdess's hat and white gown, with lovely blue eyes and a beaming smile. I am afraid it was very odd of me, but when I saw it I clasped my hands and said, \" Oh, is that Miss Letitia ? \" \" It is your grandmother,\" said Uncle Arthur, with an astonished look at me ; and I grew very hot and crimson as papa explained that Deborah had told us all about her, and Tiny said laughing, \"The chronicles come between Mab and her wits.\" \"What chronicles?\" said Uncle Arthur, with another look at me, and Tiny was just going to"], [329, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 307 tell him, when dear papa, in pity to me, stopped her. I did not dare give so much as one look at the picture all breakfast time. Afterwards, papa told me that I had better not always think out loud, as he called it, before others. Of course he must be right, but I do not quite understand. I only asked a question. Am I never to talk of what my mind is full of except when I am at home ? And papa said \" not always,\" and he laid a stress on the word. How am I to know when I may, and when I may not ? It will involve so much thinking before every word ! Perhaps Janet will explain ; but I begin to think paying visits and mixing in society, as Tiny calls it when she is in one of her grand moods, must be rather tire some and difficult, and I know I felt very un comfortable all breakfast time. It was different when we three went out alone together. I could talk as I liked then, and oh, how nice it was! There were so many things to be seen that we did not know where to go first. I wanted to climb the hill up to the village, and see Dr. Staynes's house ; Tiny wished to see the park and the beeches, and Janet proposed walking down the road to the Manor. She wanted to see where dear mamma was brought up, and where Aunt Ann lived for so long, and we all assented at once. Janet thinks most about mamma because she remembers her better than we do ; but since papa's story, Tiny and I have felt as if we had been brought closer to her than ever before, and"], [330, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 308 Cobden and the park went out of our heads as we drew near the Manor House. It is only a farm-house now, and a farmer and his wife and several children live there ; but we went in, and over all the rooms, and saw the parlour, with its black and gold wainscoting, and the sunny window where Aunt Ann used to drink tea. We went into the garden, too, which is very much as it was, only not so well kept, and stood and watched the shadows on the old stone sun dial. I felt as if I were in a dream, and almost expected to see our mother \u2014 a quiet, grave girl \u2014 step out of the house and stand by my side. It was trying to see in her stead a big, awkward boy, and two younger children, peeping at us through the garden-gate, and still more so, to be followed about by the farmer's wife wherever we went. I could not bear it at last, when I saw Janet's distressed look at the parlour as we passed it a second time, and I made her go in alone, and kept Mrs. Hart at bay by talking as fast as I could, till it was time to go back to the Hall. I was re warded for my pains by Janet's sweet smile at me, as she came out of the room with wet eyes. Farther down the road, in a garden perfectly brilliant with sweet-williams and peonies, was the house where dear old Deborah lived with her Uncle Roger, till she took service at the Hall. I should have liked to see every corner of it, but we contented ourselves with looking, and I was delighted to discover the old mulberry-tree, where"], [331, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 309 Uncle Roger used to have his pipe and ale on summer evenings. Then we turned to go back to the Hall, and now comes the something which I said had happened to-day. When we had got about half-way, we were overtaken by a gentleman lead ing a pony, who looked at us very earnestly as he passed us. His face was a very interesting one, and we were sure he was a gentleman, though he was so shabby. He had large, soft, dark eyes, and hair that was almost white, although he did not look older than papa, and a melancholy, dreamy face, which had a great deal of refinement in it. He had a book in his hand, and the pony's bridle over his arm, and turned and looked at us very earnestly, as I have said. I suppose it must have occurred to him that he was doing what might be thought a rude thing, for he suddenly lifted his hat, turned, got on his pony, and rode up the hill. We speculated a good deal as to who he could be, and to our surprise came upon him again just outside the park gate. He was in a ditch by the road-side, holding a plant in his hand, which he was intently examining, now and then looking into his book, while the pony stood patiently by his side. Our surprise was greater still, when we came down-stairs after having taken off our things, to see him in the hall, talking to papa and Uncle Arthur. Papa called us and said, \"This is your cousin, Geoffrey Allworthy.\" He looked strangely shy and uncomfortable, and was going to bow, but"], [332, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 310 Tiny held out her hand, and so we all shook hands and went in to luncheon. From what Uncle Arthur said, I gathered that this cousin of ours lives quite alone, and dislikes society; and that it was with great difficulty uncle got him over here to see papa, for he hardly ever leaves home ; and now he has come he seems so shy that I quite pity him. Papa told me after wards that his father had died very much in debt, and that his home, Allworthy Court, is all going to ruin, because he cannot afford to keep it up properly, and that he saves every penny he can to pay the creditors, and lives himself in a small house in the park, which used to be one of the keepers' lodges. I respect him for that, and I respect his shabby coat too, which cannot prevent one from seeing that he is a gentleman. It was too hot this afternoon to do more than sit in the garden, and in the evening Uncle Arthur made Tiny sing to him, and set Janet down to chess with Cousin Geoffrey, who is a very good player ; so papa and I sat outside the window and had a nice little talk. It was then he told me about Cousin Geoffrey. July 10th. \u2014 I was too tired to write down any thing yesterday. The Dugdales came. Two grand daughters of our Aunt Dorothy. She had several sons, and these two young ladies are children of her youngest son, and live about ten miles off. Their names are Dorothy and Henrietta, and they are called Dolly and Nettie. They came with their"], [333, "MY O WN PEOPLE. 311 mother, who put me through such a catechism before she had been in the house an hour, that I do not feel disposed to like her. But, oh, the girls are so handsome! I watch them as I would a picture, and think of Deborah's description of Aunt Dorothy, their grandmother, and feel sure that they are like her. Dolly, the eldest, is very tall, and has the most lovely hair and eyes I ever saw ; hair of a rich dark brown, plaited all over the back and top of her head, and eyes that almost match the hair ; then her complexion is clear and bright, and her teeth, which she shows a good deal when she smiles, as white and even as possible. Nettie's hair is a shade or two lighter than her sister's, and her eyes are blue. They are very friendly, and talked a great deal to Tiny, who got on with them better than I did : for I felt as if I could not talk, but only look at and admire them, and I wished they would leave me in quiet to do so. Tiny laughed at me afterwards, and said I was like a mouse all the evening ; I wish I could suit myself at once to people as she seems to do. wth. \u2014 I have had a walk alone with Cousin Geoffrey, and this is how it came about. I had gone out into the garden after breakfast, to gather flowers, and I was carefully sorting them according to their colours as I went, when I came upon him, sauntering along, with his hands behind him. His shyness had so infected me, that if it had been possible, I should have avoided him, but there was no way of escape, so I went on, not"], [334, "3 . 2 MY 0 WN PEOPLE. looking up from my nosegay, and wondering if I ought to speak to him. To my surprise he spoke to me. \"Are you fond of flowers ?\" he asked. \" Yes, very,\" I answered. \" I love them dearly,\" and I looked up at him. \" Yes, you love those,\" he said, pointing to my carnations and roses ; \" but do you love field flowers ? \" \" I don't know much about them,\" I said, \" except daisies, and buttercups, and clover, and you can't make a nosegay of them.\" He gave me a pitying smile. \" Come with me,\" he said, \" and I will show you something more than that,\" and as we went along he kept mur muring to himself, \" daisies,,buttercups, and clover; so that is all she knows of field flowers,\" till I was half amused and half discomfited. He took me out of the garden, through a bit of the park which I did not know, where there were sheep grazing, and through a gate into a meadow. There was a steep bank on one side of the meadow, with some trees on it, and down below on the other side, was a deep, narrow lane. \"There,\" said he, when we had scrambled up, \" look down.\" And I looked down while he put the brambles aside, and saw a steep fern-clothed bank, with hollows in it, where grew fox-gloves, purple and white, the bright pink stars of the wild geranium, delicate convolvulus, white with the faintest blush in its cup, silver star-wort, purple mallow, and, tangled amid the emerald grass, a"], [335, "MY O WN PEOPLE. 313 network of snowy bindweed, and wreaths of wild briony and honeysuckle. \" How lovely ! \" I exclaimed ; \" but those are not all field flowers ? \" \" They are only the hundred-thousandth part of our British field flowers,\" he replied ; \" and then there are the grasses and ferns. The works of God are boundless.\" He said these last words in a very solemn way, lifting his hat and looking upwards. His shyness seemed all gone. \" Last month,\" he went on, \" you would have seen the ragged-robin growing by the pond, yonder, where now the grass looks snowy with meadow-sweet, and this hedge was then festooned with wild roses, and the bank enamelled with strawberry blossom ; as the month before, it was carpeted with wild anemone and hyacinth or blue-bell, and before that with celan dines, primroses, violets, and two or three kinds of speedwell, and the hedge fragrant with spring hawthorn. Next month the fruits will come.\" \" Fruits ! \" said I, in surprise. \" Yes. The strawberry may even now be hiding somewhere under the green carpet down there. Next month you may gather and eat handfuls. Then there will be the orange hips and haws, the wreaths of scarlet briony berries, and the clusters of ivy fruit will be forming, though they do not come to their full purple lustre till later in the year ; and have you forgotten the blackberries and nuts ? \" I had only thought of something to eat."], [336, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 314 I was silent with surprise and pleasure, and stood looking down at the beautiful bank, feeling very ignorant and stupid, till Cousin Geoffrey made a sudden step forward, let go the branch he had been holding, which, being a bramble, re minded me pretty sharply of the existence of blackberries, and scrambled down the bank. \" Can you come down ? \" he called to me. \" No.\" \" Then I will come up and bring it to you,\" and he presently appeared, panting, and holding a lovely little flower of brown velvet and gold. \" There,\" said he triumphantly ; \" I never saw one before on this bank,\" and he held it to me. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"It looks like an insect.\" \" Ah, just so,\" said he, in a delighted voice. And he began to repeat some lines, something about \" ambrosial gold,\" and \" velvet fragrance,\" which I mean to ask him to tell me again. \" It is the bee orchis.\" Then as he looked at my face he smiled, and repeated, \"Daisies, butter cups, and clover, eh ? \" \" Of course I knew,\" I said, feeling vexed, \" that there were more wild flowers than that, Cousin Geoffrey, but you said field flowers.\" \" It means the same thing,\" said he. I stood silently admiring the orchis for some time, and then said, half to myself, \" I don't think Deborah knew much about flowers. She never told us much about them.\""], [337, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 315 \" Deborah\u2014 Deborah,\" repeated Cousin Geoffrey, \" who is she ? \" \"Our old nurse,\" I said ; \"but she is dead.\" \" Deborah Standish, ah,\" he repeated to himself in a dreamy way ; \" I heard she had gone to live with Nelly. So she is dead too, like so many more ! \" \" She was very old,\" I said. \" Old ? Yes, I suppose so,\" said he. And he seemed to be trying to recollect something, and after a while gave a heavy sigh. \" Old !\" he re peated, \" why / am \u2014 how old do you think ? \" and he suddenly fixed his great dark eyes on me. I had no time to feel embarrassed by the question, and I said at once, \" You must be older than papa, and he is fifty-three.\" \" You are right,\" he said, \" I am fifty-five.\" He said no more for some time after that, and my thoughts went back from him to the bee orchis I held in my hand. We were walking towards the Hall again, and as I glanced up at him, I saw that he had his dreamy look on, and that he walked with his hands behind him, and his head down, in a reverie. I did not dare speak to him then ; I felt so sure he would hear me no more than the buzzing of the gnats around us ; and we went on in perfect silence till we got into the garden again. Then he woke up and looked at me. I think he had forgotten me for the time. \"And so Deborah is gone,\" he said; \"were you fond of her ? \""], [338, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 316 \" Yes,\" I said, my eyes filling with tears. \" Home is not the same now she is dead.\" \" Ah, you think so now, but it will be the same soon. Life goes on, whether those we love die or live.\" His tone was very mournful, and I felt that he must have lost some one who was very dear to him. But the next minute it changed, as he said, \" Would you like a lesson about the flowers ? \" \" Oh, yes,\" I replied eagerly, \" so very much ! \" \" Then come this way,\" and he took me through the shrubbery to a small tool-house, and seating me on the handle of a wheel-barrow, he gave me, as he said, my first lesson on botany. I had always supposed it a dry study before, made up of Latin names and classifications, but it was so clear and interesting as it came from his lips, that I was sorry when the luncheon-bell rang, and ventured to ask when he would give me another. To my delight he has promised me another to-morrow. 1 2th. \u2014 Poor Cousin Geoffrey ! We had a pleasant hour's lesson in the tool-house this morning, while the others all went out riding, and when it was over he surprised me by saying, \" You have got your mother's love for flowers, Mabel.\" \" Mamma ! \" I said ; \" did you know her ? \" and then I felt myself colour at my forgetfulness, for of course he must have known her well, and there rushed to my memory Deborah's story of Aunt Charlotte, and little Geoffrey and his brother run ning into the nursery, and Geoffrey saying, \" Oh, what a pretty little girl ! \""], [339, "MY 0 WN PEOPL E. 317 \" Know her ? \" he repeated. \" Yes, I knew her well\u2014 before your father did. You are not like her,\" he went on, gazing at me, \"but your sister Janet is.\" \" Yes, I know,\" I said. \" Papa says so. And Janet is very pretty ; don't you think so ? \" He did not answer, but got up from his seat and paced restlessly about the tool-house ; then sud denly stopping he said solemnly, \" Child, may you never know what it is to be haunted by ghosts of the dead past.\" I was half-frightened by his manner, and did not understand his words, but he did not seem to expect any answer or remark from me, for he went on talking half to himself, which I begin to see is his habit. I suppose it comes from living so much alone. \" The past, \u2014 yes, every one has a past, and with some it merges itself so gently and graciously into the present, that the two can hardly be dis tinguished ; but with others \u2014 my past stands out sharply enough \u2014 first disgrace \u2014 then a dawning joy \u2014 then a disappointment \u2014 a blank \u2014 and now,\" he suddenly turned to me, \" why do you interrupt my growing calm with your questions ? \" \"I am \u2014 very sorry,\" I faltered, really frightened, and my- voice seemed to recall him to himself, for his manner changed instantly to one of the greatest gentleness, and he came and took both my hands. \" Don't be afraid of me,\" he said, with a very sweet smile. \" I had forgotten you were here"], [340, "318 MY OWN PEOPLE. till you spoke. I beg your pardon if I startled you.\" \" And I \u2014 I beg your pardon for asking questions. I did not think it was any harm ; but papa says I ought not to think out loud now, as I used to do when I was at home, and I cannot help for getting.\" \" Your home ! \" he repeated. \" Yes, prize your home dearly, Mabel. It is a precious thing. I think I shall go back to mine \u2014 such as it is \u2014 to morrow.\" \" And what is to become of my lessons, Cousin Geoffrey ? \" I asked, for he had quite reassured me, and there is something in his smile which makes me love him. \" Your lessons ? Ah, I was forgetting. Well, I will stay then, if you care for them.\" And his face brightened so much that I felt glad at heart that anything I could say should work such a change. \"Yes,\" he repeated, \" I will stay for the lessons \u2014 for nothing else, mind ; \" and with these words he went out of the tool-house, and I came in and ran up-stairs to write down what had passed, while it was fresh in my mind. Poor dear Cousin Geoffrey ! Since I have thought over what he said, I see that the shame he talked of must have been the separa tion of his father and mother ; and Deborah said, too, that Mr. Allworthy altered for the worse, and papa told me that Cousin Geoffrey pays his debts. But I wonder what the joy and the disappoint ment were !"], [341, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 319 Nineo'cwck. \u2014 Oh, I have been so vexed ; so dread fully annoyed and ashamed ! What will Cousin Geoffrey think of me ? My eyes are so sore with crying that I can hardly see to write. Mrs. Dug dale asked me after dinner where I had been all the morning. I felt a little reluctant to tell her, remembering her catechizing before, but of course I had to answer that Cousin Geoffrey had been giving me a lesson on botany. She laughed in an uncomfortable kind of way at this, and said, \" Poor child, we must take better care of you for the future ; must we not, Nettie ? \" \" What ! \" said Nettie, \" have you been with Cousin Geoffrey ? I pity you ! Isn't he a bore ? \" \" No,\" I said indignantly. \" I didn't think so. He was very kind to me, and told me the most lovely things about flowers, and he said \u2014 \" here I stopped in time, for I had been going to repeat what he had said about my inheriting mamma's love of flowers, and I felt that I would rather not tell Mrs. Dugdale anything about it. \"Well?\" said Nettie and her mother together, \" he said what ? \" \" I would rather not tell you,\" I said in great confusion. \" Please not to ask me.\" Mrs. Dugdale laughed again, and this time Nettie joined. \" Oh, if it is a secret,\" said the latter, \" we won't inquire, you odd child ! \" \" Only,\" added Mrs. Dugdale, \" there is nothing"], [342, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 320 to be gained from poor Geoffrey. Janet knows better, by attaching herself to her uncle.\" I looked at Janet, distressed and bewildered, and saw her colour, while Dolly said, \" Now, mamma, that is not fair. Janet don't look as if she knew what the word gain means, and as for this poor child, you have puzzled her entirely.\" And she came up and kissed me. It was very kind of Dolly, but I could not recover myself immediately, though I should have got over it had not something much worse happened, when the gentlemen came in ; for Mrs. Dugdale took occasion to say aloud for every one to hear \u2014 \" So, Geoffrey, this young lady has been telling us that you and she have a secret together.\" \" Oh, Mrs. Dugdale ! Cousin Geoffrey ! \" I cried, and I felt myself grow crimson ; \" I never said any thing of the kind.\" \" Why you said that Geoffrey had told you some thing which you would rather not repeat ; and if that is not a secret \" \" I said, \u2014 it was not that ! Oh, you know how it was, Mrs. Dugdale ! \" I exclaimed, and I hardly know what other words I used, I was so over whelmed and indignant, and so afraid that Cousin Geoffrey \u2014 oh, dear, is it very wrong to hate Mrs. Dugdale ? I was nearly crying when papa laid his hand on my shoulder and said \u2014 \" A good deal depends on how things are spoken, Mrs. Dugdale ; and whether they are spontaneous or not. I don't think Mabel at all likely to have"], [343, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 321 boasted of having a secret. She is too much of a little mouse for that. Go to bed, my child ; it is past your time.\" And he pressed my hand and kissed me tenderly. The kiss soothed me so that I ventured to glance at Cousin Geoffrey, as I got up to go. He was looking at me so sadly and yet so kindly, that I was upset again, and not venturing to bid any one good-night, I went away up-stairs and have had a good cry. Oh, what will he think ot me ! How can I set myself right with him, for that I must and will do ! I dare say he thinks at this moment that I boasted of the few words he spoke to himself, as being a confidence addressed to me. I wish I were at home again, or that Deborah were alive and here. 13X \u2014 Janet came to me last night when I was so miserable, and I told her all about it, and what Cousin Geoffrey had said. She fondled me and begged me not to cry, for that nothing more had passed on the subject in the drawing-room, \" and you know, Mab,\" she said, \" poor Cousin Geoffrey is not quite like other people, he has most likely forgotten all about it already.\" \" Not like other people ! no, he is much nicer, Janet, and you should have heard and seen him when he talked about his home. It nearly made me cry ; and for him to think that I\u2014\" and I broke down again. \" I can't bear it, Janet,\" I sobbed. \" I must tell him how it really was, before I go to bed.\" Y"], [344, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 322 But Janet said I must not sit up, and that she would tell him herself, when the others were gone up-stairs. I hugged her in gratitude, and then she made me promise to go to bed, and left me. I did as I was told, but I did not go to sleep ; I lay and waited for Janet's footstep for what seemed hours, but was in reality only one. At last she came, and sitting by me, told me that he had sent me a message. \"Tell her,\" he had said, \"that I understand it all, and guessed how it was from the first. I quite believe in her. Poor child ! it is hard to be mis judged, and she is learning her first lesson rather roughly.\" \" There, Mab, now go to sleep like a good, happy child.\" \" Yes, Janet,\" I said, as I leant my weary head against her ; \" how kind he is ! I love him ; but what does he mean by my first lessons ? \" \" You can ask him yourself, but now you must sleep. Good night ! \" I said \" good night,\" and shut my eyes, but I did not sleep for some time. Dozing off at last, and then waking and opening my eyes, I saw Janet sitting with her head on her hands, thinking. She sat still so long that I wondered what her thoughts could be about. But directly I began to wonder, I slept. Last evening seems to me now something like a nightmare. Cousin Geoffrey was so kind to me at breakfast this morning. He sat by me,"], [345, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 323 and did what he could to reassure me, and spilt a whole cup of coffee into my lap in his endeavours to make me comfortable. He is certainly very awkward, and coloured like a girl at the accident, while Nettie and Dolly both laughed, which made me very angry, for I thought it both rude and un kind. I am afraid society is making me wicked. I hardly ever used to feel cross and angry till I came here, and now something happens almost every day to make me so. Cousin Geoffrey gave me my lesson as usual, but we talked about nothing but flowers, and he went out for a long walk by himself, directly it was over, not appearing at luncheon, at which I was greatly relieved, for I had to bear a great many joking allusions to my \" knight \" and \" squire,\" as Mrs. Dugdale calls Cousin Geoffrey. Janet asked me to sit with her in the garden, in the afternoon, as the others were all going to drive or ride, and I was so glad to keep quiet, and be with her alone. She is never unkind, or rude, or anything but her dear, gentle, wise self. We sat together under a large lime-tree on the lawn, and talked of what had happened since we arrived. I said to Janet that she was Uncle Arthur's favourite, as could be easily seen. She looked pained, and said she did not see why it should be a question of favourites at all : of course Uncle Arthur would be fond of all his nieces. \" Yes,\" I said, \" but you are like mamma, you know. Cousin Geoffrey said so.\""], [346, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 324 To my great surprise, Janet coloured violently at this remark of mine. \" Don't you love to be like mamma, Janet ? \" I asked. \"Yes, dear,\" she replied, as the colour faded away almost as quickly as it came ; \" but I don't love to draw attention, and to provoke jealousy. But there, do not trouble your little head about such matters ; they are hateful, and it is better not to understand them, Mab.\" \" But, Janet,\" I persisted, \" I am getting old now. I am all but seventeen. I think you forget that sometimes, all of you ; and I am taller than either you or Tiny,\" I added ; for I do think it is time my sisters left off calling me \" little,\" and fancying me a child. Janet smiled and kissed me. \" I beg your pardon, Mabel dear, but why should you want to under stand an unpleasant subject ? Why not enjoy yourself simply as you used to do ? \" \" Because,\" I replied, \" since I came here, I seem to be much older. Why should Mrs. Dugdale be jealous of you ? I am sure Uncle Arthur is very kind to her, and Dolly, and Hettie.\" \" I don't know,\" said Janet ; \" but, Mab, we won't talk any more about it. We will enjoy what there is to enjoy here, and that is a great deal, and we shall go home again and love that all the more.\" \" Yes, that we shall,\" I said, with a sigh. \" I almost wish we were going back to-morrow.\" \" What ! before you have seen Cobden ! What"], [347, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 325 do you say to going there with me, when it grows cool ? \" I assented delightedly, and we went; found out the farm-house where lived Mrs. Williams's son, who perfectly remembered the old Doctor's French wife and her sister, and showed us the house where they had lived, now turned into a small shop. We wandered about the village, and talked about Aunt Ann and Mrs. Staynes, who is still alive in France, with Antoinette, and, on our way home, we went into the church-yard and found Dr. Staynes's tomb. I was transported back to Deborah's days again, and only returned to the present at dinner-time. I really seem to be living among what Cousin Geoffrey called ghosts of the dead past. But they are pleasant, kindly ghosts, and don't haunt me in any fearful or painful shapes. ibth. \u2014 We returned this morning from a visit to no less a place than Allworthy Court, Cousin Geoffrey's house. It is not kept up, nor does he live in it, as I said before ; but the old house keeper w-as delighted to make up some beds for us, and said that it did her heart good to have visitors. Our visit came about in this way. Cousin Geoffrey talked of going home in spite of my lessons. He appears to be restless and un happy, and not at his ease amongst us. He says himself that he is unfit for society, and is best alone ; but Uncle Arthur laughs at him, and tells him that he will make matters worse by cooping"], [348, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 326 himself up, and then proposed that we should all go over and see his house and bring him back again. \" You want to see that all your things are in order, your pets well, and none of your shells or plants stolen \u2014 that's it, I know,\" said Uncle Arthur ; \" and we all know that you can't be away from your microscope for more than forty-eight hours without pining to go back to it. It is a fact, Mabel,\" he said, nodding his head gravely at me ; \" he is a very curious man, this cousin of yours. But we will go over and see that all is right, sleep at the Court, and come back to-morrow. Mrs. Wilson will be in ecstasies.\" So it was settled, and we drove the twenty miles to Allworthy Court the next morning, were set down at the lodge where Cousin Geoffrey lives, and walked across the large paddock, for it can hardly be called a park, to the house. I looked out for the cedars and Scotch firs, which Deborah had mentioned as forming the chief beauty of the place, but could not see them, and I heard after wards that they had all been cut down, together with many others, by Cousin Geoffrey's father, to raise money. This accounted for the bare, some what dreary look of everything. The house is large and handsome, but it faces the north, and the high hills behind it screen it from the sun, so that in winter it must be cheerless and cold. The carriage-drive was weedy, and the lawn unmown. A couple of peacocks were sweeping along in front of the stone steps, and as we came up they"], [349, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 327 scuttled off with a harsh scream. Beautiful crea tures enough, but unloving. I could not help fancying I saw in the whole scene a type of poor Aunt Charlotte's life ; and I did not wonder at Cousin Geoffrey's preferring the little sunny lodge to such a grand, gloomy building. We went through the rooms, which were handsome, but I did not care for them, then up a great, wide, slippery oak staircase to see where we were to sleep. We three had one large double-bedded room, and Mrs. Dug dale, and Dolly and Nettie, another. I was glad we were to be all together, for there was something about the place which gave me a creepy feeling, and Tiny said the same. The housekeeper talked incessantly, glad of an opportunity, and told us she had been there thirty years. It was forty-five years ago that Aunt Charlotte died, so I thought it useless to ask any questions about her, but to my surprise she over heard a remark of Janet's, and said at once, \"You are speaking of master's mother. I recollect her when I was quite a girl, and I re member her funeral well.\" \" Then you are a native of the place ? \" said Janet, and I drew near to listen, while the others strolled on. \"Yes, miss,\" said she, \"I never lived anywhere else. Allworthy village, Allworthy Court, and the Allworthy family have been my world, so to speak.\" I thought of Deborah and the Stirlings ; but this"], [350, "328 MY OWN PEOPLE. Mrs. Wilson was very unlike her, and wore a handsome silk gown, though it was in the morning, and a wig. \" I never thought to live to see the house empty, and an Allworthy living where Mr. Geoffrey does,\" she went on ; \" but I suppose I shall never see things otherwise now. He is not a marrying gentleman ; if he had been, and had taken a lady with a good fortune, it might have been very dif ferent for all parties.\" \"You must have been very young when his mother was alive,\" I said, wishing to hear all she knew of Aunt Charlotte. She smiled. \" I am older than you think,\" she said. \" Forty-five years ago I was twenty years old, but I had never been out to service, for my mother was a cripple, and I had to be at home to do every thing.\" \" Then you must have known Aunt Charlotte, said Janet. \" A little,\" said Mrs. Wilson hesitatingly ; \" but she was away for a long while. She came home for a time w-hen Master Charles died. I remember that well.\" \" Do tell us about it,\" we said. \" Well, he fell down on his head, from a tree he was climbing, and never spoke again, and Mrs. Allworthy, she was staying with her brother, I have heard, and came down then, but he never knew her. Poor thing ! he was the third child she had lost, I have heard mother say. Many a time"], [351, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 329 Master Geoffrey used to come down to mother's, and cry for his brother, poor little fellow ! for they had always been together, and he was lost without him. He was always a gentle, loving boy. Mrs. Allworthy went away again afterwards, and lived somewhere alone, and the squire left the Court too, and it was shut up, and the place was dull enough. Mrs. Allworthy's sister took Master Geoffrey with her to her own home, and I was glad of it, for he was moping himself quite ill. After a time, Mr. Allworthy came back, and then my mother died, and I was offered the housemaid's place here, which I took, and have lived here ever since. There was a great deal of company and dinners going on then, but all among gentlemen, and the squire was not as steady as he had been, and drank hard, and took to bad ways. I suppose it was from being lonely like, and no ladies ever near the place.\" \" But Mrs. Allworthy came back,\" I said, deeply interested in this confirmation of Deborah's story. \" Yes, she came back, but she died a few weeks after: that was the saddest time of all. No one could help being sorry for her, poor thing ! but she had brought it all on herself. I was sorrier for master, I must say ; for he had been very fond of her once, every one said, and then he was driven to bad courses, as one may say, by her. But she died, and one must not speak ill of the dead, only it was all through her that the place is what it is. Mr. Allworthy took to gambling, and lost more"], [352, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 330 money than he had to pay ; and when he died, of a fall from his horse, he was in debt for thousands of pounds.\" Here was a commentary on Deborah's story indeed ! She had said, when she told it to us, that she did it for a warning, and here was a warning stronger than any words. I said to my self at the time that Mrs. Wilson was very hard on Aunt Charlotte, who had been so unhappy and so penitent ; but I remembered afterwards that she had loved her master as much perhaps as Deborah loved Miss Charlotte, and that of course she felt for him most. \" And that is the reason Cousin Geoffrey lives at the Lodge ? \" I said. \" Yes. He is a good man, if ever there was one, and I have known him since he was nine years old. There is never a charity in the place, which the family was accustomed to support, that he doesn't give to ; but he doesn't take the money out of what goes to the creditors, but out of his own pocket \u2014 what he allows himself, that is, which is little enough. He is a good man,\" she repeated emphatically. At that moment we heard voices calling us im patiently. \" Janet ! Mab ! where are you ? Do come ! \" And we had to hurry off. We found Cousin Geoffrey, Uncle Arthur, and papa waiting to walk back with us to the Lodge ; and as we went up the little garden-path to the door, Cousin Geoffrey's pets came out to greet him"], [353, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 331 and look at us. There was a large grey cat, very stately and consequential, a small terrier full of fuss and excitement, and a solemn parrot, who put his head on one side and exclaimed, \" A pack of thieves! Be off with you!\" and then chuckled in a way which belied his words. The first object that attracted my attention was an aquarium in the window. Then an old square piano had been turned into a cabinet, and was fitted with com- partments where the key-board had been, which were filled with shells, British and foreign, in most beautiful order. A large microscope stood upon the top of this piano, and a newspaper full of things to be examined by its aid, lay near. There were moths, beetles' wings, dried flowers, moss, a glass of pond water, and many other things. Then there was a small case of most brilliant- looking artificial flies for fishing, and rods and lines filled up every corner of the room. I must not forget to mention a bookcase filled with volumes, most of them scientific, for Cousin Geoffrey is a great reader. It was a pleasant room, far more habitable-looking than any one of the great apartments we had been looking at, and I spent two or three hours there very happily. The rest of the party went to the river, but I was tired, and Cousin Geoffrey set me down to the microscope, where the wonders I saw wholly ab- sorbed me. When I had at last done admiring, I fell to thinking again over what the housekeeper had told us ; and I felt my esteem for Cousin"], [354, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 332 Geoffrey rise higher and higher as I did so. I was full of pity, too, for his sad life ; and piecing Deborah's story to Mrs. Wilson's, I could trace the whole to its source ; and involuntarily there came to my mind the warning about God visiting the father's sins upon the children, which has always seemed to me such a mysterious and awful one. The rest of the afternoon and evening passed very happily ; and as we walked to the Court to sleep, there was a sensation of novelty and romance about it all which Tiny said made her feel as if she were a character in a novel, which observation made every one laugh, and put an end to senti ment at once. No restless spirits haunted the rooms at night, as I had half fancied they must, or I slept much too soundly to hear or see them ; and we drove away back to the Hall, bringing Cousin Geoffrey with us. I was vexed with Janet, that when he made some little demur about coming just at the last, and looked at her as if to decide for him, she turned away and said nothing. It was not like her. 17 th. \u2014 We have been for a long expedition to the sea : two carriages full, and the rest on horse back. It has been a cooler day than usual, for there was a heavy thunder-shower in the night, which had laid the dust and freshened the trees, and brought out a new perfume from the leaves and blossoms. The wayside flowers seemed to me to have a different aspect, and to look at me with friends' faces, now that I knew something about"], [355, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 333 them and their names ; and as we drove along, now under the shade of tall trees, musical with blackbirds, and now in the open sunshine, with the voices of larks high above our heads, past meadows full of cattle rejoicing in the fragrant moist grass, and hedges gleaming with silver and diamonds, I felt too glad at heart to recollect that there were any disagreeable people in the world. By-and-by we neared the sea, and a certain salt spiciness came into the air, while every now and then a cart full of sea-weed passed us, and left a trail of fresh sea-scent behind it. Then we drove into the little village of Key sham, and the horses were put up, and we walked down to the sea shore. There was nothing particular about the place, except the exceeding beauty of the little bay ; the long stretch of hard white sand, over which, at low water, one could walk for two or three miles ; and some curious flat rocks, which also came into view when the tide was down, and were covered with green weed, barnacles, and other sea-creatures. But the sea itself was a novelty to us ; and just to sit and look at the tiny ripples coming and going, and play idly with the streamers of sea-weed, and grope among the stones for agate and onyx, and listen to the never-ending plash and murmur, was enjoyment enough. Dolly and Nettie announced their intention of bathing, and Mrs. Dugdale said she would stay with them ; and papa and Uncle Arthur proposed a stroll along the shore till"], [356, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 334 luncheon-time, so we set out \u2014 papa and Uncle Arthur in front, Cousin Geoffrey with Janet, Tiny, and me behind. Cousin Geoffrey was very silent, and we walked along for some time without speaking, till I caught sight of some lovely pink sea-weed, and stopped with Tiny to get it, while Cousin Geoffrey and Janet went on together. They were some fifty yards on in front when we had secured our treasure, and I proposed a race to overtake them, but Tiny stopped me with a mys terious, knowing look on her face. \" Don't be a goose, Mab. Leave them alone. I have a secret to tell you.\" \" What is it ?\" I said, surprised. \"Let us sit down here in the shade of this old boat, and I will tell you all about it.\" She spoke in a solemn under-tone which im pressed me a good deal, and I sat down without a word, and prepared to listen. Putting her face close to mine, as if the sea could hear what she had to say, she whispered \u2014 \" I think Cousin Geoffrey is in love with Janet.\" These few words so astounded me that I sat perfectly still, staring at Tiny, and at last burst out with \u2014 \" Why, he is older than papa !\" \" That don't matter,\" said Tiny sententiously ; \" that don't matter a bit, Mab. Papa is only fifty three.\" \" And Cousin Geoffrey is fifty-five : he told me so,\" I said. \" You must have made a mistake,"], [357, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 335 Tiny. How do you know ? He can't have told you.\" \" No, but I have eyes, and I have seen him looking at her when he thought nobody saw him.\" \" But that is because she is like mamma,\" said I. \" He said she was very like mamma.\" \" How do you know that ?\" asked Tiny. \" Because he told me so,\" was my answer. \" Told you that was why he looked at her ?' \" No, no, Tiny,\" I said impatiently. \" Well, I don't care,\" said Tiny, poking the point of her parasol resolutely into the sand ; \" I am sure he is in love with her. You'll see ! \" \"What shall I see?\" said I, alarmed. \"She can't be in love with him, you know, and that's one comfort.\" \" Why can't she ? and why should it be a com fort ? Mrs. Dugdale says it is time one of us were married.\" \"Tiny, how can you!\" I cried indignantly. \" Mrs. Dugdale, indeed ! \" \" And,\" went on Tiny reflectively, \" I think so too, Mab, though it never came into my head before. Besides, I thought you liked Cousin Geoffrey.\" \" So I do ; but Janet ! why you know she always says she should like to be a dear, good old maid, like Aunt Ann, and how could we do without her ! Oh dear, Tiny, I wish you hadn't put it into my head.\""], [358, "336 MY OWN PEOPLE. \"You are such a child, Mab,\" said Tiny with great dignity. \" You don't know about things.\" \" I know,\" I said, a little hotly, for I was vexed at Tiny, who is only two years older than me, calling me a child, \" I know that Mrs. Dugdale has put it into your mind, and I think she is a horrid woman.\" \" No one put it into my mind,\" said Tiny ; \" but I heard her and Dolly talking about it the day before yesterday.\" \" Talking about it ! But that does not make it any the more true ; and,\" I went on triumphantly, \" I k?imv Janet would never have him. She said he wasn't like other people ; and just think how awkward he is ! and he is very poor, too.\" \" People don't care for that when they love each other,\" said Tiny. \"There was Beauty and the Beast, you know. How hot and angry you look, Mab ! \" \" I can't help it,\" I said, almost crying. \" I wish we had never come, if that is going to hap pen, and \u2014 and, I get vexed every day, I think.\" \" I didn't mean to vex you,\" said Tiny. \" I thought you would like it. Mrs. Dugdale said it would be such a good thing. I am frightened to death of Cousin Geoffrey myself, he is so queer and so clever, but Janet is different ; and as for you, Mab, I thought you and Cousin Geoffrey were such great friends, and yet you call him awkward, and don't want to have anything to do with him. I don't think it's very kind of you.\""], [359, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 337 I thought this myself, and I was in a puzzled state of unhappiness, and could not understand what I felt. I was sure I loved Cousin Geoffrey, and I was equally sure I did not want Janet to marry him. \" Don't let us talk any more about it,\" I said at last, thinking that I would ask Janet if it was true in the evening. \" Very well, we won't,\" said Tiny jumping up ; \"we will go and meet them. They will be coming back by this time ; \" and we resumed our walk along the sand. But a great weight seemed to have fallen upon me, I felt stifled with it, and I could no longer enjoy the sunshine and rippling water as I had done half an hour before. We soon met the four coming back. I was not sure at the time whether it was the reflection of my own thoughts which made me fancy that Janet looked paler than usual, and very grave. We all walked back to Keysham, papa and Uncle Arthur still keeping to gether, and I had a curious feeling upon me that we were acting parts in a play. Hardly any one spoke. Janet walked by me; I felt too con strained and conscious to talk to her, and she seemed only intent on watching a little white-sailed boat, which looked as if it were idly floating in the sunshine. Tiny tried to talk, but even she did not succeed. Oddly enough, it only came into my mind just then that Keysham was the place where Mr. Herbert's French wife died, and where her cousin had been going to marry Dr. Staynes, if it had not been for Aunt Ann. Was there a fate"], [360, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 338 over the place, that miserable or disagreeable things had so often happened there ? Mrs. Dug dale and Dolly and Nettie came to meet us just at the entrance of the village, and their lively talk and laughter dissolved the spell for some of us, but not for me. They had got their hair streaming over their shoulders to dry, and were full of a plan to have luncheon out on the shore, instead of in the inn parlour. This was agreed to, and we had it under the shade of an old boat planted upright in the sand, and full of the pleasant smell of ropes, tar, and old fishing nets. I hardly know how the afternoon went. The tide was out at its farthest at twelve o'clock, and was beginning to roll gently in by the time we had finished our luncheon. Cousin Geoffrey, who seems to know all about sea animals and shells, as well as flowers, called me to look at some curious kind of creature he had found sticking to the flat rocks I have spoken of, and we wandered about on them, slipping and stumbling till I almost forgot Tiny's conversation, and entirely forgot the tide. When I looked up at last it had covered one or two of the rocks between us and the beach, and I saw that the one on which we stood was the only dry one, and that we must wade through the water to get off. I said so to Cousin Geoffrey, who would never have discovered our situation by himself. We had some difficulty in getting to dry land, and then it was at the expense of wet feet and ankles. The little adventure entirely brought back my"], [361, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 339 spirits, but I got well laughed at by the others, and had to go into the inn to dry my shoes and stockings. Once there, I had no inclination to go out again, but sat at the bow window of the little sitting-room till the carriages were ready, watch ing the water as it rolled in like clear amber in the sunlight. It was a relief when the day was over and I was alone in my room. I sat by the open window, and began to think that the dis turbance of my mind was altogether selfish and wrong. Why should not Janet love Cousin Geoffrey ? Why was the repugnance I felt to the notion so great ? Was it only because I could not bear the idea of losing her ? or was it partly the thought of its having been made a subject for dis cussion between Mrs. Dugdale and her daughters, which had offended my sense of what was delicate and proper ? I puzzled over these questions for some time, and Janet found me still sitting at the window when she came up to bed, and gave me a gentle scolding. I put myr arms round her and looked at her wistfully, but the question I had meant to ask would not come. \\Wi. \u2014 The day has passed by with nothing of any consequence to relate. Uncle Arthur, papa, and Cousin Geoffrey were shut up in the library for nearly the whole morning. Some wondering remarks were made about the business that could be keeping them ; and Nettie said, \" I should not wonder if Cousin Arthur were going to be married at last, and Mr. Harrington were drawing out"], [362, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 340 the settlements. Now, Mabel, don't look so. I declare you think everything one says must be true. I'm sure I hope it isn't, for then there would be an end to all chance of a legacy for us, and it is so horrid to be poor.\" \" Nettie,\" said her mother, \" how can you talk in such a wild way ? Mabel has more sense than to believe you ; \" and she gave Nettie such an angry look that she was silenced. This remark, however, whether in fun or earnest, set me wonder ing why it was that Uncle Arthur never had married ; and I constructed a little romance of my- own on the subject, which I suppose will always remain such as I made it. Sunday night. \u2014 I felt a curious and painful tugging at my heart when Janet and Cousin Geoffrey were missing after church. Tiny gave me a mischievous look, and I felt as if my fears were on the point of being realised. I walked away disconsolately, and went up-stairs with a book that I might be alone. I sat reading and thinking by turns for nearly an hour, when the door opened and Janet came in. I was sitting at the window, which was open, and the curtain was blown out with the draught of the opening door, and then collapsing as the door shut, twisted itself round my chair, completely covering me. I could see Janet, but she could not see me. Her face was very much agitated, and she threw herself on her knees by the bed, and hiding her face began to sob. I could not bear it, and rushing to the"], [363, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 341 bedside threw my arms round her, and begged her to tell me what ailed her. She almost screamed at my sudden appearance. I suppose I must have startled her very much indeed, for she is usually so very quiet and unexcitable. Her sobs ceased and she cried on softly, hiding her face ; but when I made her lift it up and entreated her to speak to me, she broke into something like a smile and tried to speak, though her lips quivered too much, and her tears came once more. \"Janet,\" I said desperately, \"is it about Cousin Geoffrey ? \" She hid her face again \"Then it is,\" I said. \"Oh, Janet! if you love him as he loves you \u2014 why, of course, it will be dreadful for me ; but if you love him, Janet \" \u2014 Janet looked up, her tears gone, and her face of a vivid colour. \" Mabel,\" she said, \" what do you mean ? How do you know ? \" \" I do know,\" I said, \" and I won't be selfish any more. I will give you up, Janet. I wish he had been a little younger, but I love Cousin Geoffrey, he is very kind to me, and very clever, too,\" I went on, working myself to quite a heroic state ; \" and only think what Mrs. Wilson told us, that he had always been gentle and loving from a boy ; those were her words, and it will be such a thing for him to be happy at last ! \" Janet smiled thoroughly this time, and got up from the bedside. \" My darling little Mab,\" she"], [364, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 342 said, \" my own little sister ! \" and she was going to kiss me, but I held my head back. Somehow I could not feel magnanimous, and the embrace gave me a chill. I did not like to see her look so happy at my words. She was very ready to leave us all, I thought bitterly. But to my surprise she put her arms round me, half laughing, half crying, and said: \" You foolish Mab ! How could you think, how could you suppose \" \"Think \u2014 suppose!\" I interrupted. \"Tiny told me so, and Mrs. Dugdale said it would be a good thing. Oh, Janet, isn't it true ? \" \" Isn't what true ? \" asked Janet. \"Why that Cousin Geoffrey is in love with y-ou ! \" \" I\u2014 I am afraid that is true,\" said Janet reluc tantly, and colouring afresh. \" Afraid ! Then you don't care for him,\" I cried, forgetting all my previous arguments in his favour. \" I am so glad Janet, so glad ! I told Tiny I was sure you could not really care ;\" but I stopped my gleeful exclamations as I saw Janet's face. I had forgotten poor Cousin Geoffrey. \" Has he asked you to marry him ? \" I whispered. She bowed her head. \" Oh, poor man ! I am so sorry for him,\" I said. \" Is he very miserable, Janet ? He won't drown himself, will he ? \" \" No,\" said Janet, with another faint smile, \" I don't think he will do that : but,\" here she paused, \" I think I can venture to tell you, Mabel. You are growing up, as you told me some days ago.\""], [365, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 343 \" Yes,\" I said, \" I will never repeat it. I never could talk of such things, you know. Please tell me, dear Janet.\" And we sat down by the window, and Janet, with her arm round my neck, told me ail about it. It seems she had guessed the truth some days before, she did not tell me when, but I do think it must be a case of love at first sight, a thing I never believed could be true before. She avoided him as much as she could, without seeming unkind ; but for so shy a man he was wonderfully persistent, and during that walk on the sands at Keysham, Janet would have been too glad of our company, when Tiny insisted on our keeping behind. On this Sunday afternoon he had found an opportunity of speaking to her after church, and had told her that he had loved our mother. Poor, poor Cousin Geoffrey ! that was no doubt the disappointment he spoke of to me. No wonder he looked so un comfortable when he first saw us and papa, and that Uncle Arthur had found it difficult to per suade him to come. I wonder he could bear it at all. And Janet is so like mamma! I see it all. Janet said she was very much touched at his confession, and greatly distressed when he went on to say that he now felt he had given way to his grief and disappointment and had wasted his life, but that if Janet could possibly care enough for him to marry him, it would be a happiness such as he had never dared to look for."], [366, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 344 I wonder, yes, I do wonder how Janet had the courage to say No ! When at last she had made him understand that she could not do as he wished, his hopeless face as she left him, upset her entirely, and she came up stairs to cry as she thought unobserved. \" He will not let it overwhelm him a second time,\" she said tearfully, \" but it is very grievous, Mabel. His life has been a very hard one.\" \" Yes,\" said I ; \"I wonder why such things happen. And it has been none of his fault.\" But I could not help feeling glad at heart, with all my pity for Cousin Geoffrey, that Janet was not going to marry him. She was our own Janet still. It seemed to me impossible to go down-stairs again that evening, but it had to be done. I hardly dared look up from the tea-table, but when I did summon courage to do so, I saw that Cousin Geoffrey was not there. I pictured him to myself, wandering alone and unhappy in the lanes or fields, and longed to go and comfort him. To night Janet and I have both prayed that God would be his comforter. The next morning he was gone before we went down to breakfast. He had left a book for me on wild flowers and grasses\u2014 such a book as I had seen him with, and had longed to possess \u2014 full of beautiful illustrations. He had written my name and his own initials inside. Dear Cousin Geoffrey ! I cried over the book, and sat down and wrote him a letter of thanks, in which I tried, very"], [367, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 345 clumsily, I am afraid, to make him understand how sorry I was for him. I showed it to Janet, and she said it would do, so I sent it. Of course Janet told papa and Tiny. Tiny at first said that it was cruel of Janet, but she soon relented, and confessed that things were better as they were. She seemed to think it a very grand thing for Janet to have had an offer ; but then she could not feel for Cousin Geoffrey as I do. She does not know him so well. 2gth. Our last day at the Hall. Janet had a letter and a small packet by the post. The letter was from Cousin Geoffrey ; the packet contained a small gold seal, with the name \" Nellie \" engraved on the stone. Janet told me what was in the letter, but she showed it to no one. The seal was given to him by mamma, when they were play fellows together at the Hall, after the death of little Charles. Cousin Geoffrey was half broken hearted at the time, and used to mope and look so sad, that mamma's tender child's heart bled for him, and she used to try and comfort him by every means she could think of. One day she brought him this seal as her most precious possession. The boy kept it, and appears to have almost looked upon it as a talisman, and wore it from boyhood to manhood, his heart full of love for the sweet little giver. He has sent it to Janet, as being the thing he values most in the world. He says that in parting with it he is parting with a great many hopes and memories, and that he wishes to"], [368, "346 MY OWN PEOPLE. feel that in doing so he has given them wholly into the hand of God. I could not cry over what Janet told me, it gave me too deep a feeling for that, but I felt as if I could never sufficiently revere Cousin Geoffrey for the noble way in which he bears his disappoint ment. It will surely be made up to him in another world ! To-morrow we go home. The Dugdales left this morning. Uncle Arthur gave them beautiful dresses each before they went. They are very poor, papa says, so I suppose I must forgive Mrs. Dugdale for being jealous of Janet, for Tiny says they told her that if Janet lives long enough she will come into this property, and have the Hall for her own. I do not see how that is possible, and, at any rate, it is far enough off to prevent any body from thinking about it, one would suppose. I cannot help being glad they are gone, and that our last day will be a quiet one. I walked with papa up and down in the moon light just before bedtime, and he asked me if I had had a happy visit. I told him I thought now it was over, that it had been a very happy one, though I had several times been very puzzled and unhappy. But that was all gone. Papa kissed me and said, \" As you grow older, Mabel, much that puzzles your inexperience now, will look clear enough ; but you must not expect unmixed happiness even in a fortnight's visit.\" I know papa is right, and I have been very"], [369, "MY OWN PEOPLE. 347 happy, and begin to wonder already why things troubled me as they did. At some future time when these Chronicles, now at an end, come to be read over, I dare say my fears and perplexities will seem very small even to myself.
