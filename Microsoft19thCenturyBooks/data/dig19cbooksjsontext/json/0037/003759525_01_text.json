CHAPTER I. ON THE WAY TO THE MILLS. Brooding over a fire that needed stirrings, pulling at a pale coffee-coloured moustache with one hand, nervously unbuttoning and buttoning his black waistcoat with the other, sat with his feet on the fender, a man who had left his thirtieth year well behind him, though his fortieth did not yet cast its shadow on his face. He was scarcely showing at his best as * I feel that it is due to myself, in order to prevent any misconception, to state that when I commenced this story in December, 1888, it bore the title 'The Mills of God,' and it was not until arrangements were on foot for its publication, that the discovery was made of a serial story then running under the same title. Thus forestalled, a change in mine became compulsory, hence the above. \u2014 I. B. VOL. I.

There were deep furrows between the pro minent bushes of his closely-contracted eye brows, and incipient lines across a forehead whose backward slope was only apparent when, as now, his wavy hair was pushed back as if to give thought free scope. Beard and moustache made a mystery of his mouth and chin, but his lips were on the move as if agitated by the same nervous tremor that kept eyes and fingers in motion, whilst jerky mutterings found their way between a full round set of large white teeth. He was alone, evidently attempting to re concile the irreconcilable, weighing and ponder ing chances and possibilities that would not adjust themselves to his satisfaction ; and men do not look their best when alone, under such conditions. The setting on the table behind him of a common tea-tray, holding a bachelor's solitary cup and saucer, had not disturbed his cogitations. He was troubled with something less easy of digestion than simple tea and toast, or even the sardines placed there as a relish.

Nothing venture, nothing win. I'll risk it.' So saying, he took a shilling from his waist coat pocket and sent it spinning into the air, to fall on the worn hearthrug at his feet. ' Heads I win, tails I lose. Head, by all that's auspicious. That settles it.' As he spoke he cast his eyes around his small and homely sitting-room with a self assured confident air of elation which seemed to make quite another man of him. He straight ened his back, gave his head a toss that shook"], [16, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 4 his straggling light brown locks into place, pulled down his wrinkled waistcoat with a jerk, gave a brisk stir to the melancholy fire, and with a beaming smile sent thought and its furrows fleeing towards the limbo of the past. The change was marvellous. The face that had confronted the fire was not a pleasant one by any means ; the one that bent over the tea tray, and made the best of the half cold toast and tea, might be prepossessing, if nothing more. He did not relish the apology for a comfort able meal, though he did not ring for a fresh supply. He only smiled the more, and said, half aloud, \u2014 'Ah, I'll soon change these miserable sur roundings. Mrs Copeland shall not sigh in vain over her troublesome tenants, or the perplexities of legal details, if she will permit me to control them ; and I don't think she will need much persuasion. ' It was a lucky chance laid old Sedgwick on his back, and left me at the head of affairs. the last six weeks.

I wish' \u2014 and a shade passed over his face \u2014 ' I wish I could have found that partnership deed as well as the will.' And again his fingers went twiddling among his waistcoat buttons. He brightened. ' No matter. I have learned what may be the making of me, unless I am a fool and throw away my own chances, and I'm not likely to do that.' He pushed aside his cup and saucer, and gave the dingy bell-rope a twitch that brought his landlady, all in a flutter, into the room before the bell had ceased to vibrate. ' Goodness ! Mr Bromley, how you do startle one. I thought the chimney must be on fire. You was quiet enough when I brought in the tray, for you never stirred when I spoke to you. I thought you was having a dose. But, goodness me ! what's the matter ? You're surely not going to be ill. You've neither drunk your tea, nor eaten half your toast, nor touched them sardines as you're so fond of.' The good woman, who was not unmindful of her lodger's comforts according to her lights,"], [18, "6 The Slowly Grinding Mills. looked up in his face for a sign or token of coming malady, so unusual an event was loss of appetite. 'Ah yes, I must have been dozing. The tea was cold when I awoke from my dreams. But I am awake now ; and will trouble you, Mrs Pratt, for my candlestick and my clean boots.' She caught at the word, not at its covert meaning, ' I should think you was awake. I'd a notion you meant to wake the dead in the churchyard by the way you set the bell ringing. It's a wonder the rope's not down.' ' That would have been a misfortune,' re turned he with a peculiar smile, ' I must be more cautious in future. It would never do to disturb the sleepers in that bed, at any rate.' She was stopping with the tray in her hands, as if to make some further observations when his reminder, 'A light, Mrs Pratt, and my boots,' hastened her departure, and speedy reappearance with a lighted dip-candle in a flat brass candlestick, with the words, ' Your boots is upstairs, sir,' in a tone which echoed her unspoken 'wonder that he wants clean boots for at this time o' night.' Her wonder was increased when, in about"], [19, "On the Way to the Mills. 7 half-an-hour, her lodger descended the narrow stairs as spic-and-span as if he had been bound for Sunday morning service. He flicked out a white pocket-handkerchief, and thrust it with careless care into the breast-pocket of his best overcoat, gave a final twitch to his new waist coat, as she officiously opened the outer door for him, and then set off at a brisk pace, fitting on his gloves as he went. Highfield was a straggling, irregular, up and down village in a coal and iron district, of which the ancient church was at once the centre and the pride. Mrs Pratt's spouse was the parish clerk, and their house abutted on the church yard wall, consequently her doorstep was a good vantage ground for observation, as it came flush with the main street. ' Goodness, what a swell he is to-night with his scented handkercher' ! Gloves, too, and new ones. I wonder where my gentleman's off to.' The daughter of Eve stepped out into the roadway to ascertain, regardless of the rough autumnal breeze which sent a shoal of faded leaves from the swaying trees in the Rectory garden, whirling across the road, flying about her cap and face, and swooping in at her open"], [20, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 8 door to litter her tidy passage. Gas had not yet lighted up the dark places of Highfield. and a whole fleet of black clouds provokingly scudded across the moon to baffle her, except when her lodger's shadow crossed a lighted window, an open shop, or a kindly lamp over some special portal. She made her comments as he went briskly on with long, peculiar strides, and head erect, now in the light, now in the shade. ' He's not gone for billiards at the New Inn, that's clear ; and now he's passed his governor's. Maybe he's going to hear the lecture. No, he's gone past the Institute. Why, where can he be going ? He's not one o' the chapel folk. He's never turning down Moorside Lane, surely.' She stood cogitating and watching some time. ' Happen he's bound for Bridge End ; but goodness, he'd not ha' dressed up to go to Armstrong's, not he. Ha ! Asaph ! ' she presently called to a great lad with a covered basket, who stopped at a door to leave a bottle of medicine, and came at her call. ' What do you want, mother ? ' ' I say, did you pass Mr Bromley on the way?' 'Ay, that I did. He ran against me and my basket in the dark soon after I had passed"], [21, "On the Way to the Mills. 9 the chapel. I thought he'd smashed all the bottles. He nearly knocked me over. Then he called out : \" Take care, stoopid ! Look where you're going ! \" But' I gave it him back sharp enough : ' \" Look where you're going, Old Nick!'\" ' You shouldn't have said that, Asaph. It's wicked to call names, and it doesn't do to offend your mother's lodger.' 'Well, I didn't call him out of his name, did I ? ' said the doctor's boy in an in jured tone. ' What did he call me a stoopid for ? It's him as was stoopid \u2014 tearing along in the dark, as if no one else had a right to be out.' ' Well, well ; but did you happen to notice which way he went ? ' ' Ay,' answered the lad in the same aggrieved voice ; ' I stood still, and watched him turn the chapel corner down Moorside Lane.' ' Goodness me ! Nobody lives there but the Stanfields and Mr Copeland's widow. He'd never, surely, be going to either of their houses. ' Why not, if his guv'nor sent him ? ' was Asaph's logical retort. ' And you forget, there's Finch's and Cowan's. But I must be off, or I may get my ears pulled. Good-night, mother.'"], [22, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 10 ' Good night, Asaph, and don't be so ready with your tongue another time.' On went the boy with his empty basket, close under the churchyard wall, and round the corner to his master's surgery, and she into the house to sweep away intrusive leaves and in dulge in fresh speculation, unaware that her black lace cap had a tell-tale decoration of Vir- ginia creeper. ' He's never trimmed himself up to see either Cowan the blacksmith or Finch the carpenter, I know. Asaph's guess may be right, after all. He may have gone on office business to either the Squire's or the widow's. Lawyer Sedg wick won't be able to face the night-air for a long while. But, goodness me, Mr Bromley needn't have got himself up so grand ; nobody'll mistake him for his master. Eh ! but I'd best look alive, or Pratt will be here for his supper afore I've damped and folded half them clothes.' Leaving her, still curious, to sprinkle and fold the linen she had washed, we may as well follow her lodger along Moorside Lane, past the car penter's silent shop, then a few yards farther on past the open forge, where the furnace was aglow, and the smith's hammer clinked on a collier's pick under repair, whilst the pitman"], [23, "On the Way to the Mills. 11 a sturdy young fellow named Saunders \u2014 waited outside, and Cowan's neighbour, Finch, leaning over the half-door, called out it was 'time to give up.' A kindly 'Good-night, sir,' from all the three greeted him in passing, and was returned a little stiffly, as if a town-bred man had not yet fallen in with the cordial country custom of wayside salutation, or desired to repress famili arity. ' What a swell the lawyer's clerk is to-night,' remarked the carpenter when he was out of hearing. ' I'd like to know what brings him up this road so late ; it's well nigh eight o'clock.' He had gone on some distance, under the shade of a thick, overhanging plantation of dark firs, with barely a glance across the road at the lodge-gate or the stone wall shutting in Squire Stanfield's grounds, and still on a couple of hundred yards more, to a tall, substantial, double fronted house, standing back on the right, but a few feet from the road, behind a row of iron pallisades. As his gloved hand sought the latch of the two-leaved gate, he looked up at the illumin- ated fan-light under the stone architrave, then glanced towards the pair of crimson-curtained"], [24, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 12 windows on his left, and felt as if the light and glow betokened warmth of welcome. His elated spirit seemed to bathe in the effulgence as he stood there opening the gate to his new venture, with a ruddy tinge, as of newly-spilt wine, or something else, on his morsel of white handkerchief and on his upturned face. Lightly he ran up the broad, steep flight of steps, then paused a moment, gave himself a shake, unbuttoned his overcoat, and pulled down his satin vest, before he touched the heavy knocker in the darkening shadow of the door. A neat servant-maid, in a grey stuff dress, a white muslin apron, and a little dab of crochet that did duty for a cap, opened the door and admitted him to a wide hall, where the light of a swing lamp made his eyes blink, coming fresh from the darkness without. Yet he took in every detail of the picture, from the red-and black diamond tiles under foot, the large mahogany hatstand with branching arms out spread, the barometer on the painted wall, the case of labelled minerals on a slab in the full glare of the lamp, the hall clock on the stroke of eight, to the dapper maid herself, waiting to receive his hat and coat."], [25, "On the Way to the Mills. 13 There was no necessity to give in the name of Mr Nicholas Bromley ; he was evidently expected, and he knew he was half an hour behind time \u2014 the half-hour he had lost in de liberation. ' Mr Bromley,' said the maid, after turning the handle of a door on the left. He was ushered into the warmth and light of a spacious apartment \u2014 hung with old pictures and fur nished well, if not newly \u2014 and into the presence of Mrs Copeland, the widowed owner. She had been occupied with account-books and papers at the centre table, and rose on his entrance, to receive him with a smile and a frank extension of her hand. He took it in his own, bowing low over it in respectful homage \u2014 possibly retaining it longer than was necessary \u2014 whilst he apologised for being after time on the plea of detention by urgent business. We have seen what that urgent business was ; but she accepted his bona-fides, saying, she was sure Mr Sedgwick's long illness must have made his own duties extremely heavy, and that he was most kind to spare an evening to relieve her. He took the seat she indicated, and as he"], [26, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 14 did so, noted the richness of her black silk dress, which fell in heavy and expansive folds to her feet, the filmy lightness of her symbolic cap, and her muslin under-sleeves, the smoothly braided mouse-coloured hair, the drooping hazel eyes, and the gentle mouth, so weak in outline, while he told himself that her five-and-forty years had not robbed her of all the prettiness that had captivated the late Mr Copeland. She looked like one with whom the world had gone so well and smoothly, that the cares of her own property were not mere crumpled rose leaves, but veritable thistle-burrs. And, as she stood there in the light of the moderator-lamp, with the rich crimson draperies of the two front windows as a background, he hailed, with a feeling of more than satisfaction, the little sigh of relief with which she received him. ' Yes, Mr Sedgwick's illness has somewhat overweighed me, I confess ; but I esteem it so much an honour to act as your confidential adviser in these private business affairs, Mrs Copeland, that myself and my own time are always at your disposal. I am proud to be of service in any way.' He was deferential in his manner, but whilst disclaiming any sense of obligation, left an im-"], [27, "On the Way to the Mills. 15 pression that he was able and more than willing to serve her, and he went on to show how much those services were needed. From an inside pocket he drew forth a small bundle of papers tied together with pink tape, folded and docketed with methodical care. ' I have gone carefully into these accounts, madam,' he said, ' and I find in several, gross overcharges, such as would never have been made to your late husband. Here is \u2014 ' ' Ah, dear no,' she sighed ; it is shocking how tradespeople do impose upon a helpless woman.' He shrugged his shoulders lightly. 'It is monstrous, but I am afraid it is the way of the world. You will observe, madam, if you cast your eye down your builder's account for the repair of Woodside Cottages, that I have ticked off sundry items which should be considerably reduced before you discharge the bill ; but \u2014 a \u2014 possibly you have been accus tomed to deduct a heavy discount for cash.' ' Discount ? ' She looked up in his face as if the word or the idea was new to her. ' I mean, take off a long percentage when you pay your bills, against which the creditor might possibly make provision.'"], [28, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 16 She appeared more helplessly bewildered. ' I never deduct anything. Sometimes I add up the bills to see if the amounts are correct, but I have always paid in full, and never thought of scrutinising prices. Indeed, I do not know what charges were made to my poor, dear Clarence. I had nothing to do with busi ness matters whilst he was living. I never imagined that people who had served or worked for him so long would impose upon poor me, until you made the suggestion. And you do not know how grateful I am.' She looked rueful, if that was what she meant, and sighed frequently, as he demon strated on the face of one account after another, that she had been charged more than current prices. ' Dear me ! How did you know the proper values ? ' she asked, at length. ' I made it in my business to ascertain, as was my duty in the interest of a clie \u2014 lady I desired to serve,' he corrected. ' But Mr Sedgwick never hinted even at a necessity to overlook accounts. How was that ?' The confidential clerk seemed embarrassed to reply, and the lady, putting her own construc tion on his silence, went on to say :"], [29, "On the Way to the Mills. 17 ' I am sure, Mr Bromley, I' do not know how to thank you sufficiently for the great trouble you have taken to serve me. And, really, after all, I am afraid I shall not have the courage to press these tradesmen for the fair reductions. It seems like accusing them of dishonesty.' ' If you will permit me, Mrs Copeland, to be your paymaster on this occasion, I will do it for you with the greatest pleasure. It may serve as a check to the unscrupulous to find that their accounts are audited.' ' Oh, if you only would, I shall be so much obliged. I should feel ashamed to tell people they were not dealing fairly by me.' And so it was settled, she writing out a cheque to cover all. Then he rose to leave, refusing any refresh ment except a single glass of wine. It had been to all intents and purposes a purely business interview, but the widow her self stood by as he put on his overcoat in the hall, and she again thanked him, offering her plump, warm hand, as they said ' good night.' He hurried down the steps, buttoning up his overcoat as he went with quick strides up vol. 1. b"], [30, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 18 the darksome lane, muttering in self-content, ' I've made sure of a footing at Moorside House, at all events. See if I don't hang up my hat there as master before Christmas comes ! ' The pines and firs moaned, and creaked, and plunged in the rising gale as he passed the wood, but the trees had no voices for him ; and though a very fusilade of sharp needless reft from the conifers drove into his face and stung him, as the sharper arrows of conscience might have done, he simply turned up the collar of his coat and bent his head to the wind, lost in a maze of speculation. Thus driving on, blindly as the wind, he struck against a man's shoulder, and jostled him off the raised footpath. . ' Hout, mon ! Is na the causey braid enough for twa folk ? Keep a better luik-oot anither time, or mebbe ye'll fa' foul of some chiel' wi' hetter bluid than Ben Saunders. So guid nicht tae ye !

THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. ' Really, that is a most obliging and intelligent young man,' ruminated Mrs Copeland, as she went back into her long drawing-room and began to collect the books and papers on the table. ' It is extremely generous of him to give his leisure hours to the consideration of those bothering bills, just to relieve me of my per plexities. And how delicately he gave me to understand that his services were gratuitous, and not as for a client, to swell Mr Sedgwick's long account. Ah, me ! what a difference it makes when there is a man at the head of affairs. The masculine mind seems to grasp and arrange details so naturally. When should I have thought of folding, arranging, and en dorsing those bills as Mr Bromley had done. And how quick he was at detecting extortion where I never suspected it \u2014 Yes, Dinah, you can bring the supper-tray here.' (This to the"], [33, "The Spider and the Fly. 21 neat maid-servant, who had tapped at the door and waited for orders.) ' I shudder when I sit down alone in that dreary dining-room,' she went on, half aloud ; ' and now that my darling boy has gone back to Rugby it seems more dreary and desolate than before. How thank ful I shall be when his school days are over, but that will not be just yet. He was only seventeen last March, it will be long before he is home for good. Yet how tall and handsome he looked when we parted on the platform of the station last week, half a head taller than Herbert Stanfield, and there is but a month's difference in their age. He is growing the very image of his dear father. Yes, the same broad high forehead and prominent nose, the same resolute mouth and chin, the same nut brown hair and eyes he had when that was painted.' She was standing as she said this, regardless of the dainty tray upon the table, gazing with humid eyes upon a life-size portrait in oil which hung over a rosewood cottage-piano in a recess between the window and the fireplace. 'Yes,' she went on, 'and he has just the same high spirit, the same hatred of all that is false or mean, the same quick, decisive ways."], [34, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 22 Yet, though apt to be a bit headstrong and resentful at times, what a loving, affectionate heart he has. No wonder he and Herbert are such close friends. And he might be the Squire's own son. How good it was of him to go up with the boys and see them comfortably settled. I should have been utterly helpless. Ah me ! ' With a heavy sigh she turned to the table and sat down to her neglected supper, pouring out a glass of Maderia from a handsome cut decanter before she helped herself to a portion of the partridge, served up as appetisingly as if to tempt an anchorite. But partridges were not rarities, and she had apparently lost her appetite for a solitary feast. She sipped her wine, ate a few mouthfuls, and sighed more than once unconsciously. Then she sipped her wine again, and, as if she found an idea in the glass, said to herself. ' I wonder why Mr Bromley declined to remain for supper. There was nothing unusual in offering him hospitality after his great kindness. Surely ' \u2014 and she laughed lightly \u2014 ' he did not think I was going to set my cap at him ? Why, he must be six or eight years younger than I. He need have no fears on that head. I have not forgotten my"], [35, "The Spider and the Fly. 23 poor dear husband yet. Perhaps he was afraid of village gossip. Ah, well ! if a man of busi ness may not spend an hour over dry business with a lone woman, without setting tongues wagging, there must be something radically wrong in the world. Well, well, Clarence will be at home for Christmas. I will coax him to overlook accounts for me.' A pause, another sigh, a refilled glass \u2014 ' I am not sure Clarence would do it. At Christ mas he is all for football, or skating, or music parties at the Rectory and Manor House. No, he will not be for settling to business for years to come. I shall only see my boy by fits and starts during the vacations. The house will be lively enough whilst he is here \u2014 and just as lonely when he is gone.' ' Dear me, how the wind whistles about the house to-night ! Is that rain or dead leaves beating against the windows ? I feel unac countably timid and nervous, just as if some thing dreadful was hanging over us.' She touched the bell. Dinah answered the summons. ' Has Thomas locked and barred all the doors and shutters ? ' 'All but these, ma'am.'"], [36, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 24 Has he turned Negro loose ?' Yes, ma'am.' ' Remove the tray, and then come in to prayers.' In they filed, cook, housemaid, parlour-maid, old Thomas, at once groom, coachman, gar dener, general factotum \u2014 he bringing with him a couple of bells to affix to the shutters after prayers ; it being an established principle that so long as the family were astir, the warm light from the windows should fall on the gate and the path outside, as a cheering guide to belated travellers on their way to or from the colliery on the moor. Mrs Copeland watched the closing of the long narrow shutters, and the fixing of the bells that night with a peculiar feeling of insecurity ; and went to bed in the chamber above, wonder ing how she would feel if those bells were to ring and awaken her at midnight, with only women in the house, and an old man incapable of protecting them. She kept a night-light burning, and lay long awake. But she was in more danger from her own fears and sense of insecurity than from midnight robbers. True, colliers are a rough lot, apt to be"], [37, "The Spider and the Fly. 25 quarrelsome in their cups, but as a rule they are honest and hard-working, with nothing of the sneaking burglar about them, and many are fervent disciples of John Wesley. She had nothing to fear from them, or from the poachers who made free with Squire Stan field's game, though the house was isolated, and the plate was tempting. The Copelands were held in esteem by their poorer neighbours as kindly, charitably-disposed people, always ready to help in time of sickness or trouble, and never hard on a backward tenant ; and that character was the best safeguard for their possessions. It was a practising night for the village choir, and when Jacob Pratt went home from the schoolroom at nine o'clock, weary with his ex ertions in drilling his neophytes, he found his wife bustling about to clear away her irons and ironing blanket, the tokens of her handiwork airing on a great clothes-horse by the fire, the inseparable odour hanging still about, and his supper nowhere. He was punctuality itself. He did not speak, he only looked up at the clock. ' You need not look at the clock, Jacob ; you shall have your supper in a minute. It is not my fault I'm late. Mr Bromley kept me wait-"], [38, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 26 ing sor his things best part of an hour. I couldn't begin my ironing till I'd washed up,' she apologised, laying a cloth on the round table, and talking all the while she hurried from plateshelf to pantry, and covered the white cloth with his customary cheese and bread and a glass of clear cold water. It was his theory that beer tended to thicken the voice ; hence his abstention. 'You're remarkably fine to-night,' said he, after a quiet glance at her cap. ' Fine ? ' she echoed, as she seated herself. 'I'm no finer than usual ; but you should have seen Mr Bromley, what a beau he was when he went out. I thought he must be off to the Institute ; but he didn't stop there, or anywhere, I could see.' ' Oh, then, his finery accounts for your finery, and my late supper,' observed Jacob, dryly. 'You got your crimson top-knot watching him.' Up went her hand to her head, and down came the bit of Virginia creeper. She was fairly caught, but she carried it off with a laugh. ' Goodness me, it was no crime to look down the street before I shut the door.' ' No crime, Martha ; but curiosity is not a plant to be cultivated. Mr Bromley pays us"], [39, "The Spider and the Fly. 27 regularly, gives little trouble, has no visitors ' (' And no letters,' she put in), 'and it is no con cern of ours where he goes, or how he dresses. If he thinks he is watched, he may change his quarters.' ' My goodness, what a fuss. He may change his quarters without watching if he is going courting. Though who there is to court down Moorside Lane is a puzzle to me, without it was Polly Finch.' Half an hour later, home came Mr Bromley to a supper almost as frugal as the parish clerk's, though it might wind up with a bottle of Allsopp and a cigar. As he removed his hat and overcoat, Mrs Pratt, who had followed, candle in hand, to re light his paraffin lamp, noticed that his long hair and beard were as thickly stuck with fir needles as a pincushion with pins. He flicked them off as he sat down, and so many fell on the white cloth she could not be mistaken. 'Oh,' thought she to herself, 'there's tell tales, if you will ; ' and went back to Jacob to relieve her mind. ' Them things never came from anywhere but Copeland's Wood. He must ha' been to see the widow. What should take him there, I wonder ? '"], [40, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 28 ' His legs and his master's business. Do thou mind thine, and leave his alone,' said Jacob, not usually a man of many words. ' Ah, so thought Asaph ; but folks don't dress up for business,' was her inward commentary. ' We shall see.' Others saw, and not without displeasure, that Mrs Copeland had put her affairs into the hands of a business man more clear-sighted \u2014 not to say exacting \u2014 than ever Mr Copeland had been. Charges which had been made on the principle ' that she was able to pay, and not likely to grumble,' were denounced by her new agent, Mr Sedgwick's clerk, as 'extortion,' and not only pared down to just proportions, but a shade below. Then, cash in hand, he de manded customary discount, and obtained it on the all-sufficient hint that the lady, weary of village prices, would otherwise transfer her patronage to Colborough, the market and assize town nine miles away. Shopkeepers and mechanics, from the grocer to the builder, compared notes, and murmured at the sudden change. ' Women are always mean,' said one. ' The old gentleman was never so sharp and niggardly,' declared another. ' I wouldn't have believed it of her, always so"], [41, "The Spider and the Fly. 29 mild and fair-spoken,' said a third. 'Ah, its them fair-spoken ones as is the hardest,' put in someone else. And so the ball rolled through trading High field, where ' Mrs Copeland ' had been only another name for careless liberality. Of course, she heard nothing of this. The people who supplied or who worked for her took her orders with smiles, or bowed obsequi ously as she drove her low pony phaeton through the village to the Rectory or back with pretty Miss Irene Preston, the Rector's daughter, by her side, but neither the smiles nor the bows were as genuine as of old. She only saw her voluntary agent with the receipted bills in his hand, along with the golden aggregate of his many and minute de ductions. No suggestion of undue pressure crossed her mind. She simply saw, as he meant she should, the cupidity of people who had en deavoured to impose on her womanly ignor ance, and could not face out their surcharges to a business man. Never had she felt her own helplessness more completely. Tears filled her eyes as she gazed at the sheaf of receipts scored with pencilled"], [42, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 30 deductions. There was pain and distress in her voice as she murmured, \u2014 ' Oh, dear, dear, I could not have imagined people we have dealt with all our lives, would have so imposed upon me in my loneliness. It is heart-breaking.' Then she hid her face in her handkerchief, and fairly sobbed aloud over the new discovery forced upon her. Beyond a bare acquiescence, Mr Bromley made no immediate remark ; but, after a long pause, as if troubled with her weeping, he said, in a tone that seemed to partake of her emotion, \u2014 ' Pardon me, dear madam, for calling your attention to these matters. It might, perhaps, have been better had I let things go on as usual, since the ingratitude of these trades people affects you so keenly. I fear my inter ference was ill-advised.' 'Oh, dear no, Mr Bromley, by no means. Just the reverse. I am extremely grateful to you,' she gasped between her sobs ; ' I am afraid lest I should have contributed to this unfair dealing by my own carelessness and un suspicion. I have never had anything to do with business all my life. And now I am left to \u2014 oh, it comes very hard.'"], [43, "The Spider and the Fly. 31 And still her tears flowed freely, his few words of apparent consolation having little efficacy. Presently she sobbed out : ' Mr Copeland always managed our house property, and collected his rents himself; but now, I fancy, our tenants ask for more repairs, and pay their rents with less regularity. They know I cannot press them for it. It seems as if even they take advantage of my forlorn posi tion. Here is just Michaelmas, yet half the Midsummer rents are unpaid.' He tapped, as if impatiently, with his finger ends upon the table. ' It would seem as if they did,' he echoed ; adding after another pause, as the widow wiped her swollen eyes, ' Do you think \u2014 I do not wish to appear ob trusive or officious \u2014 but \u2014 could I \u2014 render any assistance \u2014 call on one or two of your more troublesome tenants ? Or should I venture to suggest placing your house property in Mr Sedgwick's hands, since he already has charge of your railway stock and other divi dends ? ' 'Oh, no, no!' she answered hastily. 'He would be too hard on the poor people. My dear husband always said so, and begged me"], [44, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 32 never to let a lawyer come between me and them. But if you would not mind \u2014 I should be so glad \u2014 and any commission you \u2014 ' ' Pardon me,' he interrupted, ' I should be defrauding Mr Sedgwick if I accepted a com mission from his client, or attended to your business in his time. After office-hours you may command me ; my best energies are at your disposal, if you will graciously accept my services. I have a warm heart, Mrs Copeland, and have been much moved by the exigencies of your peculiar case. I could do no less than what I have done, considering your loneliness and unsuspicious nature.' ' I am sure, Mr Bromley, you are kindness itself. It seems strange you should have taken so much interest in poor me and my affairs. How I can ever repay you I do not know.' He knew well. He only said, with some show of embarrass ment, and a tone of introspection, ' Well \u2014 a \u2014 perhaps it is strange. We are often interested and influenced, we hardly know how or where fore. Perhaps I am more than commonly impressionable.' His voice lowered as he said this, and he did not raise his eyes to see what impression he had made."], [45, "The Spider and the Fly. 33 Possibly the momentary silence of the widow was sufficient. When he left Moorside House that evening, with authority to deal with her tenants, he smiled serenely to himself as he buttoned his overcoat over the rent and receipt books. ' Capital hit that suggestion of Sedgwick for her house-agent,' communed he, as he stalked along ; ' two birds killed with one bolt. Closed the governor's mouth before my collecting gets wind, and left the simple creature in a flutter of gratitude at my disinterestedness. Made an impression, too, otherwise. Ah, trust me, I know a woman's weak side. But I must not be in too great haste. She is not quite a fool, and I might spoil all by showing my hand too soon. She must learn to depend on me en tirely. What is her income from the colliery, I should like to know, and the precise conditions of that partnership deed referred to in the will ? The only clause that appears to limit the widow's control of everything. \" Subject to the conditions of the deed of partnership existing between myself, Clarence Copeland, the elder. of Moorside House, Highfield, on the one part, and Ernest Stanfield, of Highfield Manor House, on the other part.\" Yes, I think those VOL. i. c"], [46, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 34 are the terms. But what are those conditions ? Do they concern Mrs C. or the boy? No matter ; it must be a deep pit I cannot fathom, if I have not yet got to the bottom. It's too soon to sift the widow, and there's no worming anything out of Squire Stanfield, or cautious old Sedgwick ; but there's surely some spongy clerk at the colliery agent's in Colborough to be squeezed dry without suspicion, if Arm strong, the viewer, is not in the know. I must get at that clause ; it baffles me.' Mrs Pratt's curiosity was baffled. When she went for her Sunday joint and Mr Bromley's steak to Mr Oxley's, she was greeted with, ' Hegh, Mrs Pratt, but that lodger of yours is a clever chap. Mrs Copeland's not done amiss in getting her bills paid by her lawyer. If he'd been born and bred a butcher he couldn't have been more knowledgable over joints and weights, and all that. I wasn't born yesterday, but he got over me, though I'm not one to bate my prices for gentle or simple. It's hard to have your bills sliced down by them as can afford to pay for credit, and it's what Mr Cope land never expected. Some of my neighbours came off worse than me. Not that I blame your lodger, Mrs Pratt ; not I. He was bound,"], [47, "The Spider and the Fly. 35 as he said, to obey instructions, and do his best for their client. And I must say he was down right cute .over it. I hear he's collecting the Copeland rents now. He'll waken up the lag behinds, I'll warrant. But what can I serve you with to-day, ma'am.' ' So it's business, after all, as takes him there o' nights, as fine as any lord. I'd never have got such a cold in my head looking after him if I'd ha' guessed. Mr Sedgwick should have more conscience than to keep Mr Bromley at work till eight or ten at night. It's negar driving. And I think Mrs Copeland might offer him a bit of supper, seeing he's kept out about her business,' was Mrs Pratt's summing up, as she went home full of compassion for her overworked lodger. So ignorantly is the praise and blame of the world generally apportioned. No one had any compassion for Mrs Cope land, the unwary fly, with her feet already among the meshes of the spider's web."], [48, "CHAPTER III. KEEN EYES, THIN EARS, CLOSE LIPS. Mr Theobald Sedgwick, a long, lean man, with keen, dark eyes and close lips, was but slowly recovering from a sharp attack of rheu- matic fever, and only able to receive a few old and valuable clients in his private office. From every chink and cranny draughts had been carefully excluded by his attentive sister, a slim maiden lady of uncertain years, who managed his house, and did her futile best to manage her bachelor brother. A very unofficial easy-chair had been wheeled in for his accommodation ; a faded footstool, worked on canvas by Miss Selina's schoolgirl fingers, raised his feet from the ground ; and a huge fire blazed in the old-fashioned grate \u2014 tokens all that obstinate Theobald Sedgwick had returned to his duties before Dr Elliott (Dr by courtesy only) had signed his charter of freedom. Why he was so eager to get back to his post he kept to himself. The doctor took it as the"], [49, "Keen Eyes, Thin Ears, Close Lips. 37 natural aversion of a business man to the tedium of a sick-chamber, and as natural a desire to do his duty to his clients. Miss Selina concluded he had an ulterior motive ; but she was a counterpart of her brother, and kept her opin ions to herself. Devoted to him, she had strictly obeyed the surgeon's instructions to avoid disturbing his patient with any business details whatso ever. But his own restless inquiries, and odd words dropped involuntarily, made her doubt ful if all was as well as it appeared, or as she suggested to him. Mr Bromley's unwearied assiduity, and ac knowledged legal acumen, should have satisfied the most exacting of masters. He was in the office early and late, carried on correspond ence, advised with clients, filled in printed forms, made drafts and fair copies of leases and other documents ; and to do this intrenched on his own leisure time. What report could Miss Selina make except that the zealous clerk was indefatigable and and all-sufficient ? And wherefore should the sick lawyer groan over so favourable a state of things ? Gradually it dawned upon the observant lady"], [50, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 38 that the active and astute deputy might be more than sufficient. The lawyer's abode was a respectable, double fronted, bay-windowed, brick house of three storeys. The entrance hall, raised but a single step from the street, separated the business portion on the ground floor from the domestic. Miss Sedgwick's dining and sitting room over looked the street, and its door confronted that of the clerk's office across the passage. Between this outer office and the inner or private one, which gave to view a grass plot in the rear bordered with evergreens, was a baize-covered door of communication. It was, however, not necessary for clients to pass through the clerk's office to interview his principal, as there was a second door from the passage at the foot of the staircase. At some remote period a great kitchen door might have stood open opposite to this, but, to ensure privacy, that had been removed to the extreme end of the narrowed passage under shadow of the stairs, and the gap blocked up. Above these stairs, besides the sleeping - rooms, was a drawing - room, rarely called into requisition. It has been intimated that Mr Bromley had, in consequence of his double duties, been fre-"], [51, "Keen Eyes, Thin Ears, Close Lips. 39 quently detained long after the office-boy, Jack Reid, had been dismissed and the shutters closed, ' in order,' as he said, ' to engross some deed or study some case without interruption.' Miss Sedgwick was not only keen-eyed, but, like her brother, preternaturally quick of hear ing, and it occurred to her that there was more shuffling about the private office in these over hours than was at all consistent with quiet engrossing, and more disturbance of the ja panned deed-boxes than her brother's ordinary practice involved. The thin-eared invalid overhead may, also, have heard the sliding of these tin receptacles from their shelves, he so often asked, in irrit able impatience, ' What is Bromley doing down there ? ' and so seldom appeared satisfied with the soothing answers given. So that when the lawyer announced his inten tion, ' risk or no risk,' to take his seat once more where he could ' be easy of access for con sultation,' Miss Selina raised fewer objections than might have been expected. She simply hedged him round with precautions against cold. He had come downstairs on the forenoon of Wednesday, the 28th, all unaware of Mr"], [52, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 40 Bromley's visit to his widowed client, or of the receipts and gold in his clerk's pocket to be rendered up at Moorside House that evening. Theobald Sedgwick's presence in his private office had not been expected, yet everything there , was in order. There ap peared nothing to complain of in that respect. ' You will be glad to be at the head of affairs again, sir,' said the clerk suavely, adding, ' I have managed things to the best of my ability in your absence, and I hope it will prove to your satisfaction.' ' I hope so, too,' said the other shortly, committing himself to nothing. ' Let me hear what has been done.' One by one, Nicholas Bromley checked off the items on a prepared list, entering into particulars respecting them, with so much system and order that the old gentleman could do little else than tick off each with an approbative, ' Quite right.' Yet, as he listened, his observing eyes glanced uneasily round the walls, resting on shelves and pigeon-holes loaded with boxes and papers The ready clerk anticipated questions. Trifl ing with his waistcoat buttons, he began, \u2014"], [53, "Keen Eyes, Thin Ears, Close Lips. 41 ' I took the liberty in your absence to remove accumulated dust and cobwebs, as you may perceive, sir. I trust I have not exceeded my duty.' ' I prefer dust to disturbing fingers,' was the curt reply. 'It is the mark of honour able age in a lawyer's office, Mr Bromley.' ' Pardon me, sir, if I add that its accumu lation may denote decay as well as antiquity. Deed boxes connected by cobweb links ap pear like ancient tombs \u2014 as rarely visited. I am sorry if my newer ideas have clashed with yours in this respect.' ' Why not have begun with the books, man ? ' queried the keen-eyed lawyer dryly, his glance travelling to the law library, dusty and grim as of old. The reply was prompt and plausible ' I should have come to them in due course \u2014 most likely this evening; and if you think proper \u2014 ' ' No, thank you. I did not engage a clerk to dust my shelves or my books. My sister can do all that I require. If the Rector should call respecting those glebe lands, let him come here to me.' Thus dismissed, the clerk retreated beyond"], [54, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 42 the baize door, the eyes of the close-lipped lawyer following him as he went. '\"Antiquity!\" \"Decay!\" It is almost time your lease ran out, Mr Nicholas. I'm afraid you have too inquiring a mind for me. No doubt the office wants new blood \u2014 but not yours, young man,' mused the old one, as he rested his long bony back against the cushions in his tall easy-chair, closed his eyes and tightened his lips, whilst he matured a project conceived on his sick bed. A tap at his private door put his ruminations to flight, for the tap was followed by the charm ing face and supple form of a sweet, fair-haired girl, with beaming dark-blue eyes, a maiden who had barely crossed the threshold of her sixteenth year, who, after carefully closing the door in obedience to Miss Selina's strict injunc tions, darted forward and took both his long lean hands in hers, and with a smile that irradiated her whole face, absolutely saluted the grim old lawyer with a kiss. ' Oh, you dear godpapa, how glad I am to see you down downstairs once again ! Dr Elliott said you would not be fit to come down for a week or more. I hope you have not"], [55, "Keen Eyes, Thin Ears, Close Lips. 43 been precipitate,' and she looked wondrous solemn all at once. ' My dear Irene, it might suit Dr Elliott's practice to keep me coddled upstairs. It suits me and my practice to do my coddling down stairs. So here I am.' ' But suppose you have a relapse ? ' ' I should have had a collapse, missie, if I had remained where I was, fuming over my clients' affairs, with no one to manage matters here but my clerk.' ' But my father says Mr Bromley is a very clever lawyer. He has conducted our case admirably. ' ' Very clever, no doubt, my dear. But I am not ready to relinquish the reins just yet. I am best here, whatever may be Elliott's opinion. The sight of your blooming cheeks will be a better tonic than any he will send. You are as rosy as a peach this morning.' ' Oh, that will be the wind. There has been quite a breeze all the week. I have had to unearth a winter jacket, and September not out yet.' She took a fancy basket from her arm. ' See what fine chrysanthemums I have brought you. The first of the season. Are they not lovely ? '"], [56, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 44 ' I know who is, and quite as genuine as her posies. Now, take them to my sister. I think I hear your father's voice. He will want to see me on business. Have you come to spend the day here ? ' ' No, I am off to Mrs Copeland's. She has had a long- letter from Clarence, and I want to hear all the news. The Squire has not come back yet. Here comes papa.' Mr Bromley, opening wide the baize door to admit the Rector, caught the last sentence, and, ere Irene Preston vanished, with a lively nod and a ' Good morning,' had a momentary vision of sparkling eyes and blooming cheeks which he intuitively connected with the letter Mrs Copeland had received from her son. For the first time during the three years of Mr Bromley's clerkship, it became necessary to summon him to the conference between his governor and a client, and the scarcely con valescent lawyer inwardly chafed at the con fidential position his temporary deputy had obtained. More than once during the day the same need cropped up, and although the clerk stood whilst Mr Sedgwick and his clients were seated, and always preserved a respectful demeanour,"], [57, "Keen Eyes, Thin Ears, Close Lips. 45 the old man observed, or fancied, a shade less deference in his voice and manner. ' He has played the master so long during my illness, confound him, that he forgets he is a common clerk,' said the old man in confid ence to his ruddy fire. ' Counts on deposing the antiquated fossil, does he ? We shall see ; ' and a grim smile hovered round his close thin lips. In vain Miss Selina urged him to retire early to bed. He stuck at his post until the office was closed and shuttered, then, rejecting the prof fered assistance of Mr Bromley, insisted on being wheeled by Betty and her mistress into the cosy sitting-room to take tea with his sister as of old, ' I'm afraid you are overdoing it, Theobald,' said she, with solicitude, whilst adjusting cushions and wraps around him on a couch drawn up to the hearth, ' Dr Elliott would \u2014 ' ' Never mind Dr Elliott. I feel more like myself, and my own master, down here. The very sight of Irene's beaming face warmed me like a sunbeam. I am glad you have placed her flowers on the table, the dear child. Now, give me my tea.'"], [58, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 46 The firelight played on Miss Sedgwick's brown satin gown, on the smooth braids of her grey hair, and, in her suspiciously humid eyes, as she sat stiffly erect behind the old fashioned bronze tea-urn, furtively watching her brother's painful efforts to carry teacup or toast to his lips with those sadly cramped hands of his ; but she said never a word to remind him of his infirmity. She saw how resolutely he was bent on con cealing or overcoming his weakness, and be yond a natural expression of thankfulness in having him there once more, talked of Irene and her arrangement of the flowers ; of a lecture at the Institute, which the Rector had patronised ; of Clarence Copeland's letter home ; of anything, in short, to divert her silent brother's attention from the unuttered trouble in his mind. As if the mention of young Copeland's letter had been suggestive, he broke the ice with the abrupt question, \u2014 ' When did you hear from Norman ? ' A light that redeemed its angular plainness shot athwart Miss Sedgwick's face as she answered, with a faint tremor in her voice, \u2014 ' I heard last week.'"], [59, "Keen Eyes, Thin Ears, Close Lips. 47 Oh !

Years before, when she undertook to keep his house, there had been a stipulation that she should hold no communication with their younger brother or his family. The law had been broken when, first the brother, and then the wife, had died, leaving the son alone in London, articled to a legal firm on a stamp. Theobald had suspected an occasional correspondence, but, until this night, had never broached the subject. It was therefore with some trepidation she said, \u2014 ' I have not replied. I did not know what to say.' ' Then get pen, ink and paper, and I will dictate what you are to write.' 'You will not be harsh, Theobald, I pray. Why not bury the dead past with the dead.

All the answer to this pleading was an inci sive \u2014 ' Do as I tell you.' There was a transparent bead on the tall spinster's high cheekbone when she sat down to the table with writing materials before her, and, resting one elbow on the table, shaded her eyes with her long hand as if from the lamp light, and waited nervously with her pen in the other for her brother's words. ' Nephew ' (she prefixed ' Dear '). ' If you require a holiday you will find Uncle Theobald's doors open. Though not as soft as butter, he is not hard as flint.

Miss Sedgwick had posted her letter to the nephew in London, and was returning with firm step and head erect, as if conscious of a duty done, when behold the figure of Mr Bromley came within the rays of the Sedgwick lamp. Not Mr Bromley in his ordinary attire, but got up with glossy hat, kid gloves, and a suggestion of white pocket-handkerchief. It was so unusual, that she stopped short where she was, in the shade, and slowly turning her head convinced herself that he was not seeking the reading-room, but that he was in his best array, wherever he was bound.

Every russet or yellow leaf held a tear for departed friends. The macadamised roads were coated with a thick black paste called mud, and the village gutters were charged with sluggish streams resembling ink. Highfield, with houses more or less aslant, had a dull, melancholy aspect ; few people were abroad ; here and there a woman with a shawl over her head, or a man with his wideawake pulled low over his brows, plodded steadily along, almost resenting the intrusion of a far-between umbrella on the narrow pathway. Over the wire-blind of the front office might be seen the head of the clerk, with a face as much out of sorts as the weather. There were no tears in his eyes, but there were clouds on his brow ; and whilst he"], [66, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 54 nibbled the thumb nail of his left hand, he buttoned and unbuttoned his vest with his right. He was perplexed. All was going well at the widow's \u2014 that is, pretty well \u2014 he was not sure all was well at the lawyer's, though what was wrong he could not for the life of him make out. That Mr Sedgwick should emerge from his sick-room dogged, taciturn, tetchy, and sar castic by turns, did not surprise him ; pain and long confinement to bed sweetened no man's temper, he argued, but why, before three days were over, he should suddenly grow complacent, not to say cheerful, in spite of unsubdued pain, was, to say the least, curious. Then that Monday afternoon had brought him another nut to crack. Squire Stanfield's carriage had been drawn up at the door with the horses' head turned homewards, and before either the office-boy Jack, or he could reach the spot in respectful attendance, out had stepped a tall, gentleman like young fellow in a dark-blue overcoat, who carried a small carpet-bag and an umbrella in his left hand.

Mr Bromley discreetly retired, but the office-door was apt at times to swing ajar, and he could hear how the new arrival was first drawn into the sitting-room, as if for a hasty word or two, then led down the passage to the private door of the lawyer's own sanctum. Had his ears played him false, or had he heard this Mr Norman greet Miss Sedgwick as ' dear aunt' He had not ferreted about amongst the lawyer's papers without discovering that there was a nephew studying law in London, who was under ban on account of some family feud. If this Mr Norman was the one, what might his familiar reception mean ? And how came he in the Stanfield carriage ?

Norman Sedgwick had graduated in a school where nerves were at a discount. He was prepared to face the world on his own merits ; he had fought his way upwards through difficulties and temptations, and as he owed nothing to his uncle but the five pound note voluntarily sent to defray his expenses thither, he walked forward with a perfectly independent bearing, neither abashed nor assumptive. 'How are you, uncle?' he said, pleasantly enough ; ' I was sorry to hear you had been so long a sufferer, but am glad to see you in your office as a token you are better.' Undemonstratively the old man took the other's extended hand, returning the frank clasp with a firm, rather than a warm one. ' Glad and sorry are stock phrases,"], [70, "58 The Slowly Grinding Mills. nephew,' was the curt response to his saluta tion, whilst the keen eyes scanned him from head to foot. 'They are the common words to express common feelings, and need no garnish. If I had said I was, ' highly delighted \" or \" deeply grieved\" would you have set a higher value on my veracity ? I am not given to hyperbole, and our intimacy has not been such, Uncle Theobald, as to call forth warmer feelings, or to justify stronger expression.' Miss Selina looked from one to another somewhat ruefully. This was not a promis ing begining, she thought. ' Oh,' said the old man, ' that's it, is it ? There's some of the old blood in you, I see. But there's something of your mother in your face, too. It will never harden as your crabbed uncle's has done. We may improve our intimacy before we part, Nephew Norman.' ' I hope so,' said the young fellow, his face relaxing into a smile which showed his sensi tive mouth and chin. ' I hope so, for my mother's and my Aunt Selina's sake.' ' Oh, there, that will do. How did you get here from the station ? You don't look as if you had walked far.'"], [71, "What does it mean ? 59 ' No, I fortunately made the acquaintance of Mr Stanfield, my fellow-traveller from Rugby, and of his agreeable daughter, who joined us at Colborough. They courteously offered me a seat in the carriage waiting for them at the station.' ' Oh ! \u2014 Selina, show Norman to his room, and then come back and help me to my sofa. It's about closing time.' ' Shall I assist you now ? ' said Norman, moving forward for the purpose. ' No, not now. When you come down.' 'Quite a concession this,' Miss Selina inti mated to her nephew as they went upstairs. ' It's all right now, if he was a bit queer at first. He would not let you touch him if he was not satisfied with you. Theobald has peculiar ways of his own, but we get on very well to gether.' ' Very peculiar and very disagreeable,' thought the young man during the course of the evening. ' Unless I find more agreeable society at the Manor House, I shall not stay my week out here. If he thinks I came to toady him and assent to all his eccentric theories he will find out his mistake. It may not be civil to contradict a man of his years and ex-"], [72, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 60 perience, but I must preserve my self-respect, and maintain my right of judgment' So often, indeed, did their opinions and sentiments clash, that Miss Selina, who was most anxious to promote a good understanding between the two, grew nervous and fidgety, dropped stitches in her knitting, and could scarcely take them up again, and to herself she said, ' Whatever can have taken Theobald to-night ; he seems so snarly and contro versial, and I am sure he is arguing against his own principles.' Yet the crotchety disputant made use of his nephew's shoulder to assist him upstairs at bedtime, accepted further service at his hands, and finally dismissed him with the words, ' Your voice is very like your mother's, Norman. Thank you. Good-night.' It was quite a relief to the young fellow to discover that only Aunt Selina, whom he had known in his boyhood, put in an appear ance at the breakfast-table. She might have become stiff and formal from long association with her brother, but he well knew she had a kindly heart under the cold exterior, and so they became pleasant and chatty over the meal, he making no secret of his struggles"], [73, "What does it mean ? 61 and his prospects \u2014 or rather plans. In the course of conversation he produced the un broken bank-note she had sent. ' See, aunt, did you send this, or did Uncle Theobald ? ' ' Why do you want to know ? ' Because I do not mind accepting a gift from you ; but it goes against the grain to be under such an obligation to Uncle Theo bald. I am not hard set for a pound or two, and should prefer to return it, if it came from him.' ' Oh, my boy,' exclaimed Miss Selina, put ting down her coffee-cup as if aghast, 'you must not dream of such a thing. You would spoil all, and offend your uncle irrevocably.' ' I do not know what you mean by spoil ing all, but I must say his invitation after all these years of silence and neglect was a staggerer. His reception, however, was not so cordial as to induce me to prolong my visit, or to make it at his cost.' ' You foolish boy. Could you not see he was drawing you out. But, supposing him perverse, could you make no allowance for an old man racked with pain, and affected by the change of weather ? Then, although"], [74, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 62 he has not breathed a syllable to me, I know he is smarting under a conviction of double dealing in one he has trusted. It has made him irritable and suspicious. You must bear with him, as I do. He had overcome a life long prejudice when he sent for you. Do not mar your own prospects. He does not tell his plans to me, but I can guess \u2014 and I say, wait.' This was a long speech from Miss Selina, who was not given to waste words any more than her brother. Norman listened, looking at her steadfastly across the table. ' Hasty conclusions are commonly mistakes. I will take your advice, good aunt, if I can do so without loss of self-respect. I hear someone moving overhead. Shall I assist uncle downstairs ? ' ' If you will, Norman. He presses very heavily on old Betty or me, and he will not accept Mr Bromley's stronger arm.' So that day (and all the week) Norman Sedgwick lent his shoulder to the grip ot his uncle's long bony hand, as he came down, slowly and painfully, stair by stair, or went back at night as warily."], [75, "What does it mean ? 63 ' Can I render you any further assistance ?

We have to make it. Go to the law library, hunt up cases and precedents, and make abstracts and prepare briefs, when the office is supposed to be respectably closed. We must find time for private study when the cock crows. All our recreation comes between terms. But I dare not indulge in much of that' 'Then grasp your opportunity. Your new"], [76, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 64 friends may expect you,' was Mr Sedgwick's only comment ; ' young ladies are more attrac tive than old lawyers.' There was a tap at the door, a turn of the handle. 'Ah, here comes one, the sweetest blossom of the Rectory garden, a privileged visitor. Come forward, missie. Come and shake hands with my big nephew, Norman, and let him see what nice girls we have in Highfield. He only came up from London yesterday, but he has stolen a march upon us, Irene, and made Miss Octavia's acquaintance already.' ' He could not have done better, godpapa,' said she with a blush and a smile, coming forward at his bidding, and putting forth a small, neatly-gloved hand to be swallowed up in Norman's large one. ' Octavia is a delightful companion ; Highfield would be dreadfully dull without her. You will find it so after London, Mr Norman, especially at this season, when nearly all the flowers are gone, and the lawns are too damp for croquet.' ' I do not play croquet, Miss \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 : ' Preston \u2014 Miss Irene Preston,' supplied a prompt voice from the easy-chair."], [77, "What does it mean ? 65 ' Thank you.' And Mr Norman went on : ' I have scant leisure for learning new games, Miss Preston ; and few feminine friends to instruct me, if I had. Only flowers of rhetoric are cultivated in Furnival's Inn ; but, if I may presume to say so, there are some fair flowers blooming in Highfield, whatever may be the season.' An inclination of the speaker's head pointed the allusion, and brought a richer bloom to Irene's cheeks. ' I came hither to see my uncle and aunt,' continued he, with scarcely a percep tible pause ; and my stay will be so brief, dullness will not have time to find me, see ing that I have made such charming ac quaintances at the outset.' ' Oh ! ' interjected the voice from the big chair, in a tone between a growl and a chuckle, as if at some rich joke. ' Then do you go back to London so very soon ? ' questioned the artless girl, who had drawn close to her gaunt godfather, and . laid her hand caressingly on his bony shoulder. 'At the end of the week. I must be at my desk on Monday morning. vol. 1. e"], [78, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 66 'That is a short stay. I fancied you might perhaps be here until Christmas, when Clarence and Herbert are home from Rugby. That would be so jolly ! ' Again the extraordinary growl or chuckle, from the enigma by the fireside. ' I am not likely to make the acquaintance of Messrs Clarence and Herbert, and must take their jolliness on credit,' was the amused reply of Norman, from the superior eleva tion of his manly years. ' I presume they are your brothers.' ' Ah, dear, no ! ' with a sigh ; ' I have neither brothers or sisters. I thought god papa would surely have mentioned Clarence Copeland and Herbert Stanfield. I'm sur prised Octavia said nothing of her brother.' The baize door opened after a discreet tap ; Mr Bromley put in his head and half his body. ' Farmer Redfern desires to see you, sir. Shall I say you are engaged ? ' he added, coming farther in, the better to scan the unusual group. ' Say I will see him in three minutes, prompt. Have you the affidavits ready ? ' 'Yes, sir.'"], [79, "What does it mean ? 67 A nod. Mr Bromley was gone, and the door closed. ' Now, pet, you must go. But you have not told me your errand yet' ' I came to bring these woollen mits I have crocheted to keep your poor hands warm,' said she, affectionately, producing her gift. ' I know you feel the cold severely. Miss Selina said so.' ' You are a good little missie.

What do you say ? ' Hesitation was but momentary. ' Pleasure must at all times give way to business. I am at your service,' was the ready answer, as he held the door open, and respectfully bowed the young lady out, the eyes of Theobald Sedgwick following him keenly.

'Then you would not carry the case into Court and fight it out there ? ' argued Mr Bromley, with those restless fingers of his at his buttons. ' 1 would not. It would be an inglorious fight, and involve the defendant in damages and double costs. I have seen a man stripped of all he possessed who had a much clearer case to go upon. I give my opinion with all deference to that of Mr Sedgwick.' ' Farmer Redfern, you have known my opinion all along. You hear it seconded by a lawyer fresh from the London Courts. If you prefer to empty your pockets into mine and our opponent's, you can do so, and we will sharpen our weapons for the fight, but we say \" Don't.\" ' And 'don't ' it was.

I want naught but what's fair and honest ; and if your clerk there, when I came here for advice, hadn't persuaded me that I was right, and Stubbs in the wrong, and his claim an imposition, I should have settled it right off long ago.' ' What a couple of fools ! ' was Mr Brom ley's private comment in his own office. ' A long bill of costs thrown away, after all my pains to fan the smoking flax to flame.

Did he imagine Theobald Sedgwick was a weasel asleep ?"], [82, "70 CHAPTER V. CULTIVATING ACQUAINTANCE. The restless fingers of his uncle's clerk had not escaped Norman Sedgwick, nor the change in the man's smug countenance when o o the thick, close brows contracted for a mo ment in swift displeasure at the overthrow of his fine legal castle. Norman's eyes were keen and observant as those of the elder, if less furtive and suspicious, and he was not favourably im pressed with Mr Nicholas Bromley. But he had his share of the family reticence, de veloped, no doubt, by his legal training, and he kept his private opinions to himself. If at breakfast-time he had been in haste to depart from Highfield altogether, he had also a desire to honour the double invitation of the Squire and Miss Octavia Stanfield before he went away; persuading himself"], [83, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 71 he only desired to look upon his own mother's friend. At least, that was his mental excuse for remaining under a roof where his reception had been so curt and ungracious. Yet, when bucolic client and clerk had left the coast clear, and he was free to 'grasp his opportunity,' as advised, he lingered, drew a chair to the fireside, and entered into a discussion of legal topics, as if never a young lady was in his thoughts ; never a vision of clear dark eyes and firm red lips, with a show of pearls between, was to be seen over the gaunt shoulders opposite. Light had broken on his darkness since the morning meal. Some little illumination had been shed by his anxious aunt. But fuller rays came in with the slight form and fresh face of Irene Preston. Not that he saw in her more than the warm-hearted, generous, unsophisticated girl she was. But the evident affection subsisting between god child and godfather, and the sudden trans formation of the grim old man in her presence, set a warmer current free in the nephew's breast. ' Uncle Theobald has warm pulses beating"], [84, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 72 somewhere. He cannot be naturally cold and stern as I have heard and have found him, or he would never have won a place in this young creature's heart Aunt Selina may be right, after all.' It was this new impression caused him to take the half-hint, and remain to assist in disentangling the legal knot Mr Bromley had so cleverly tied, when he would so much have preferred cultivating his acquaint ance with Miss Octavia and her family. As if a dark impalpable veil had fallen from his uncle's face with the cutting of that knot, the brusque impenetrable despot was seen transformed. He became simply a man of clear perceptions, and unbiassed opinions to whom justice and integrity were more than personal gain. Norman asked himself: What could have warped the nature of such a man ? New cords of interest seemed to draw him towards his long-estranged and misre presented relative. A feeling of respectful sympathy had sprung into being which might ultimately warm to something strono-er. The taking of that chair for conversation was but the natural impulse of the moment,"], [85, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 73 so too was the prompt readiness with which his arm was tendered as a support to the yet enfeebled frame, when dinner was announced. Over the meal the old gentleman relapsed into habitual taciturnity, but his grim features had relaxed, and did not re-stiffen, and the few words he did speak were neither sharp nor bitter. Rain had ceased to fall two hours or more ; the dispersion of the cloud indoors had but prefigured the clearance of the sky overhead, when Norman Sedgwick, wearing a new dark-blue overcoat above his iron grey tweeds, stepped out on the narrow pathway paved with cobble-stones, and took his way along the village street with well set head erect, followed by many eyes and many comments. A stranger set down at the lawyer's door by the Squire could not possibly pass on unnoticed. People meeting or following looked after him and made remarks one to to another, or to tradespeople drawn to their shop doors. Jack had spread the news that the stranger was his master's nephew ; and now one said"], [86, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 74 he was 'the very marrow of the lawyer when he was young.' Others disputed this, and maintained ' Lawyer Sedgwick was never so good-looking ' ; an old woman of eighty lifted up her wrinkled brown hands and cried, ' Here's a sight for sore eyes ! Horace Sedgwick's son on old Theobald's doorstone! My conscience, what next ? ' So one and all agreed in wondering what wind had blown him thither, and how long he was likely to stay. Unconscious of either observation or specu lation, Norman went on, with firm, free step, turned the chapel corner on his right hand, passed detached workshops where the car penter's saw and the blacksmith's hammer were at work, and after proceeding some little distance under the overhanging planta tion, inhaling the fresh odour of fir and pine, was crossing the lane carefully to avoid its muddy pools, when the ornamental iron gates of the Manor House were thrown open, and a low pony-phaeton came forth almost before he was aware or could avoid a splash. The driver was a gentle-featured lady in widow's weeds, and by her side sat Miss Irene Preston."], [87, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 75 The young girl smiled and nodded pleas antly. He raised his hat, and as they drove past him up the hill towards the village he could imagine from her speaking countenance, and the movement of her head, that she was enlightening her companion as to his identity. For a minute or two he stood dreamily looking back at them over his shoulder, just as one in a crowded street may be casually attracted by a passing vehicle or a stranger's face, the remembrance of which may be fleeting as breath from the polished surface of a mirror. The future was as blank to him as to them or to the smart apple-cheeked lass who closed the great gates, and stood in the narrower gateway by the lodge, also looking after them, and waiting to admit the stranger, evidently on his way to the house. The spider's thread was then but a film of the slightest gossamer, but, unless brushed away on the instant, it might become a coil thick as a hempen rope, and who should cut or who be caught in that ? The Manor House, a venerable old pile,"], [88, "l he Slowly Grinding Mills. 76 so embowered in ivy, that the archi tectural additions of many generations blent in one picturesque whole, stood far back from the road, partially hidden by a group of wide-spreading cedars on the bold lawn round which swept a broad gravelled drive shaded on the outer edge by green and glossy rhododendrons, backed by taller evergreens and scarlet - berried mOUntain ash. Nelly Trench, the fresh - looking, bare armed damsel at the gate, recognised a stranger in his very questioning. ' Yes, sir ; they're all at home, leastways the Squire and Mrs Stanfield, and Miss Octavia, and if you please to take the turn to the right of the lawn it's nighest the hall door,' was her answer. She too, deputy lodge-keeper when her father, the gardener, was elsewhere, looked after the visitor, wondering who he was and what was his business. 'He's a fine looking gentleman, but he doesn't belong to these parts, I know. I reckon he's come from Lunnon, o'er some colliery business or t'other. Ben said something about the sinking of a new shaft That'll be iti"], [89, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 77 And having settled the question to her own mind, she turned into the lodge to sweep up the hearth, set the kettle on the hob, and think on her sweetheart Ben Saunders, not of her master's visitor. Norman's reception was of the heartiest. The Squire grasped him by the hand and led him into a spacious oaken-panelled draw ing-room with deep mullioned windows, over looking drive and sloping lawn, and a sun dial with sombre cedars in the background. ' Here, Caroline,' said he to a lady, seated on a cushioned couch placed near \u2014 but not too near, the scorching fire blazing in a capacious basket - grate, wrought in the last century, ' here is the friend I invited. What welcome have you for Eleanor Sedgwick's son ? ' ' The very best,' said Mrs Stanfield \u2014 a white - haired woman whose fifty-five years sat well upon her \u2014 as she rose and came forward graciously with both hands ex tended to meet Norman's clasp. 'You are welcome for your sweet mother's sake ; we have yet to learn how welcome you may be for your own.' ' I trust, my dear madam, I shall never"], [90, "78 The Slowly Grinding Mills. dishonour the welcome you accord,' said he, proudly. 'You would scarcely be Eleanor's son if you did \u2014 and yet \u2014 ah, well ! many changeful years have come and gone ; the frosts of time have settled on my brow, and shorn my raven ringlets since I beheld your dear mother ; yet we were bosom friends at school, and when I married, who but she was my bridesmaid. ' Ay,' blurted out the Squire, ' and Theo bald Sedgwick was groomsman, as fine and frank a fellow as ever served a friend at such a pinch. We little thought then that Eleanor Norman would marry Horace, or the mischief that was brewing in the dark ! ' 'Mischief!' echoed Norman, glancing from one to the other, ' What mischief? My mother never spoke to me of her early days, or of her marriage.' ' Wonderful ! ' exclaimed the Squire ; ' was there ever a woman before who did not chatter about her lovers and her wedding ? ' Norman was feeling hot and uncomfort able, much as if the Squire had held a lighted fusee to a keg of gunpowder under his feet"], [91, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 79 But before another word could be said, a blithe voice from behind fell like music on his ear, \u2014 ' There will be mischief in the daylight if an old gentleman I may not name, chatters so freely about other people's lovers and weddings, and leaves his daughter out of the conversation, and his invited guest with out a chair to sit down upon. I told you this was an uncivilised region, Mr Sedgwick,' she added, offering her hand to be shaken. Norman's face brightened as he clasped it for a moment, his mere 'How do you do, Miss Octavia ?

Norman watched the white and taper fingers darting hither and thither in their cunning work, and whilst he listened, wondered what"], [92, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 80 there had been in his parents' past, she was so carefully keeping from his hearing. 'What a pity you were not here an hour ago,' she said lightly, 'we had Mrs Copeland and Miss Preston at luncheon with us. It appears that Irene had already made your acquaintance, and had inspired the widow \u2014 to whom Highfield is insuffer ably dull \u2014 with a supreme desire for an immediate introduction.' ' I am sure I feel flattered by Miss Preston's favourable representations,' he began. ' Oh, you need not. A pilgrim to any shrine in this barren wilderness is certain to create a furore, quite irrespective of his personal attractions.' ' Mr Norman, do you shoot ? ' broke in the Squire; 'if you do, I can promise you some good sport upon the moors.' Norman, shaking his head, deplored his ignorance of country sports and games. ' I am thoroughly town-bred, ' said he, ' and have few outdoor accomplishments. My leisure hours were spent with my books by the side of my sick mother. Her piano furnished my sole recreation, as it was her"], [93, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 81 solace ; so I am afraid I shall soon lose caste in country estimation.' ' Only with the gentlemen, ' cried Miss Octavia gleefully, laying down her tatting and rising to open the piano, ' the fireside thermometer will rise to fever heat. An individual who can \"discourse sweet music,\" instead of kennel and stable, game and guns, will have greater attractions than the last new novel. Do savour us, Mr Norman.' He had not expected this, and said so. ' You misunderstand me. I should dis appoint expectation. I have had no proper musical training. My mother was my sole instructor.' ' You could not well have had a better,' interjected Mrs Stanfield from the sofa. ' Eleanor was a proficient. She was the envy of the whole school.' Norman's sole apology had failed. He could not well, in the teeth of his own admission, excuse himself. He was as un willing to appear ungracious as to display, what his modesty assured him, would be his own shortcomings. If his mother's piano had been the sole relief from the monotony of dry study, he had played for few ears VOL. I. F"], [94, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 82 but his own after he had lost her. Re stricted means had kept them out of suitable society, and he would have no other ; so that, really unused to an audience, he sat down to the instrument at a disadvantage. But either he was a better musician than he knew, or they were not critical judges, for they listened as if for the first time a soul had found its way to keys and strings. With no uncertain hand he plunged at once into the sublimities of Handel's ' Messiah,' and, ere the last note had ceased to vibrate, with the delicate tones and rhythmic flow of a psalm, he gave a render ing of ' Weber's Last Waltz,' with varia tions, such as had never been heard for years in that room. ' I did not think the old musical-box had so much harmony in it,' exclaimed the Squire, who had sat intent, bent forward, with his clasped hands between his knees. ' Thank you much,' said the old lady, quietly. ' I could have fancied Eleanor's fingers had been upon the keys, I have heard her play that air, with its variations, scores of times. It had never the same expression from other touch than hers.'"], [95, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 83 ' It was a favourite of my mother's to the last ; but she said it was desecration to give it the gay rattle of dance music. She main tained that Weber had caught the melody from the angels, for it seemed to lift her up from earth to heaven.' ' No wonder, as you play it,' assented Miss Octavia, with emphasis. ' You have given me a lesson, such as Signor Capello never gave. I thank you for the unexpected pleasure.' Norman, rising from his seat, somewhat abashed by so much compliment, looked up in the speaker's face and saw those expres sive black eyes of hers humid with feeling evoked by the music. It was clear she had spoken from her heart, and that it held a fountain of tender emotions. The vivacious rattlepate was invested with a new charm. Shall we say that possibly her manifest appreciation of his performance might, in part, be answerable. Yet he felt uncomfortable under these compliments, and almost stammered out, ' It is to my mother's memory, not to me, that thanks are due if I have pleased your ears. And then, though he would gladly have"], [96, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 84 lingered by Miss Octavia's side, and watched her varying moods, he rose to retire, as in courtesy bound. Those were not the days of modern 'afternoon tea,' and, as he declined to re main for the family dinner, he was allowed to depart, after a promise to pay a second visit before his return to town, and was followed by regrets that Herbert and Miss Stanfield were not at home to be introduced. The girl at the gate was dressed a little more coquettishly than when she had admitted him, and had a sort of embarrassed aspect, as she trifled with some fine sewing in her brown hands, and looked askance at a good-tempered, cheery sort of young man, who propped up the gate-post at her elbow with his sturdy shoulders. ' Guid day, sir,' said he, civilly, making way for the gentleman to pass out. ' Good day,' returned Norman, pausing and surveying the speaker in surprise at the salutation. ' Good day to you ; but I do not know you, my good fellow.' ' An' I dinna ken you, sir, but I hope no offence. It's a canny way the pitmen an' country folk hev o' speiring to ithers we"], [97, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 85 happen to meet In lone places it's unco cheerfu'.' ' So it will be, my man ; and a very hearty custom. Good afternoon to you,' he replied, thinking how much more cordial these country people were to strangers, than Londoners even to those they knew. He thought he should carry the pretty picture of these rustic sweethearts away with him. That they were sweethearts he concluded without hesitation. And something like a sigh of regret passed his lips as he con templated his return to his solitary chambers in Furnival's Inn, where sweethearts had no place, except in marriage settlements or breaches of promise. He found Miss Sedgwick waiting tea, old fashioned country tea, for him, and, in addi tion, the rubicund jolly-faced Rector, his sister, and his daughter. ' How do you do, sir, how do you do ? ' said the Rector, impressively, with a hearty shake of the hand on introduction ; ' I am proud to see the nephew of my old and valued friends, very proud. I hope we shall live to become better acquainted.' ' I hope so, too,' responded Norman,"], [98, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 86 ' although my opportunities for cultivating friendships in Highfield will be very limited. I return to London on Saturday.' There was the same sort of half grunt, half chuckle, from the bony figure propped up in the chair by the fireside, but he made no remark beyond ' Saturday, ah, yes, Saturday.' The Rector, however, plunged into con versation with Norman, chiefly about Church affairs in the Metropolis, and made himself comfortable with hot buttered cakes and tea, whilst Irene waited on her godfather, and the young man, at every interval, contrasted the speaker's round, fleshy face with the long, lank visages beside him ; yet felt the whole atmosphere so genial, and his uncle's manner so conciliatory, he was sorry when the evening came to an end, and the con trast of his solitary evenings in London loomed in dark shadow over the future perspective. His uncle's clerk was spending a pleasant evening likewise. He was sitting tete-a-tete with the desolate widow at Moorside House. Business was speedily despatched ; yet he lingered, enlivening the time with anecdotes"], [99, "Cultivating Acquaintance. 87 of people he professed to have met, inter spersed with scraps of poetry or dramatic quotations, and contrived to make himself so very acceptable and agreeable that his going left a dismal blank for the simple-minded woman to confront. He had ventured so far as to hold her hand at parting, to sigh heavily, and to regret that one so formed for cheerful com panionship should be left to spend her lonely hours in sorrowful remembrance and regret. He caught the echo of a low responsive sigh, and went up the lane, buttoning his overcoat, elate and jubilant.

So far from finding Highfield dull, as had been predicted, Saturday came all too soon for Norman Sedgwick. All things had tended to make his holiday a pleasurable one. Invita tions for Miss Selina and her nephew had come in swift succession, feasting and friendly greet ings had met him wherever they went. The very skies had been propitious, the weather having cleared up. And what though he met at Manor House, Rectory, or elsewhere, pretty nearly the same set of people, with the same class of entertainment the very novelty of his surroundings had charms for him. And, though he had the good sense to accept the honour as due to his nephewship rather than to his individuality, it was somewhat exhilarating to be for the first time in his life the centre of attraction. He breathed a new atmosphere. As he had observed ' dulness had not time to find ss"], [101, "A Bit of Paper. 89 him.' And, indeed, there could be no mono tony in the bright presence of Octavia Stanfield or the unsophisticated guilelessness of Irene Preston. Each day there had been a looking forward to afternoon or evening, even if he had spent his holiday mornings in a dingy office with a crabbed old man, listening to his clients, dis cussing knotty points of law, arguing out real or imaginary cases, and sometimes with little more than a civil apology, riding roughshod over his uncle's opinions. In the heat of argument he bowled away at the legal ninepins Theobald Sedgwick set up, and knocked them down when he could, with little more hesitation than if his adversary had been a fellow clerk. It might not be politic, but it was characteristic. He was willing to be convinced by reasons and citations stronger than his own ; but he would not budge an inch when he had law and pre cedent on his side. Whether his uncle was obtuse or obstinate, or shaky in his law, or merely drawing him out for his own amusement, was not clear to the younger man. At all events this appropriation of a too brief holiday could scarcely be regarded as recreation, even to an enthusiast in the"], [102, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 90 profession, however, in the excitement of argu ment or disputation, time might slip away unawares. He had not been sorry when privileged Irene Preston had broken in on their dry discourses, or he was summoned to the parlour opposite to be introduced to Mrs Copeland, or when the Squire carried him off vi et armis for a stroll across the moor to the colliery. He had enough of pleas and counter pleas, writs and affidavits, leases and releases in Furnival's Inn, and ' Bills before the House' had lost their interest for him. He, however, had his compensation when ever he came within the radiance of Miss Octavia's wonderful black eyes, or could gather up the crumbs of her animated con versation for after solace and digestion. He had been attracted by her manner in greeting her old father on the platform at Colborough ; and her reception of himself five minutes later in the train, on his intro duction as the nephew of Theobald Sedgwick and his sister, had completed his fascination. His governor, Mr Robins, had a bevy of daughters, who were fairly accomplished and made themselves agreeable, but he had met"], [103, "A Bit of Paper. 91 them from time to time without emotion, and taken leave without regret. How differently had he felt the touch of her soft, warm hand, as he took it within his \u2014 twice over \u2014 on saying ' Good-bye,' at the Manor House on the Friday night. And how her lightly-uttered comparison of his brief visit to the flight of a meteor, which left darkness more dense behind, lingered in his memory, to the rejection of the generalisa tion which allowed so little foothold for per sonal vanity. Saturday morning dawned all too soon. It was heavy, dull, unpromising. In a few hours, he told himself, he would be whirling away from Highfield. The effulgent sun, which had beamed upon him as through a rift in a cloud, would be in eclipse, and nothing remained for him but to take up the burden of life as he had left it \u2014 a lonely, solitary man, who would have to fight his way to a position with only his own ability and energy to help him forward. He set his teeth hard upon the thought. A vigorous application of cold water and towels had a marvellous effect in counteract ing the gloom of the sky. It was not his"], [104, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 92 wont to look on the dark side of his future. ' Pshaw ! ' he murmured ; ' is a man of my years' (he was twenty-four) 'to sit down like a puling child and cry for the unattainable ? Rather let me thank God that a spark has been kindled in my breast to light my path and nerve me to fresh endeavour. Men have risen by their own energies ere now, and why not I, with such a radiant star to guide me ? ' Thus he ruminated whilst dressing, and although common-sense whispered that his hair might be grey, and Octavia a matron who had forgotten his existence, before he could raise himself to her level, he was not to be daunted, even though Uncle Sedgwick had said no word to bear out the promise in Aunt Selina's letter. There was nothing for it but to go back freshened by his holiday and work his way independently. He thrust the last of his belongings into his travelling-bag, and turned the key in the lock with a resolute snap, then marched down stairs, if anything taller and stiffer than he had been. He was ready to depart with the first train if need be. Only Aunt Selina and himself at break-"], [105, "A Bit of Paper. 93 fast. For so prim and rigid a person she was singularly fidgety and nervous. The table was well supplied with edibles, and she pressed upon him the eggs, the boiled ham, the grouse the squire had shot, with more than ordinary solicitude. ' You must lay a good foundation, Norman ; you know you have a long journey before you, and your train starts before the dinner hour.' ' But you are eating nothing yourself,' he observed, as he handed his coffee-cup to be refilled. 'Well \u2014 I \u2014 the fact is I have no appetite. I am sorry we are to lose you so soon. I daresay I am very silly \u2014 but \u2014 I had hopes \u2014 Has not Theobald said anything particular to you, Norman?' The hand with which she poured out the coffee shook as she said this, until the cup resembled a white tower in the midst of a brown moat. ' Nothing' answered he with emphasis, look ing her steadfastly in the face, and extending his hand for the refilled cup, when the moat had been drained. ' I am \u2014 disappointed,' she faltered, her vis-"], [106, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 94 age lengthening, and a hazy moisture dimming her grey eyes. ' So am I \u2014 rather,' he replied ; ' but never mind, aunt What does it matter? I have seen your dear old face once more ; I have found Uncle Theobald less crusty than I anticipated ; have altogether had a delightful holiday, and shall go back refreshed to my work with a fund of pleasurable new associa tions for memory to dwell upon ; and, if we live, who knows but you may see me again next autumn ? The Squire has given me a hearty invitation if uncle does not care to have me.' Just then Betty came into the room. ' Please 'm, master will have his breakfast downstairs, and will Mr Norman please to help him down. I couldn't persuade him to have more than a cup of coffee up there, nohow.' Norman sprang to his feet ; Betty and her mistress scurried to rearrange the table, and place the big, chintz-covered arm-chair by the fire in readiness, and by the time a fresh plate, cup, and saucer were laid for the old man, his stick was heard in the passage, and he entered leaning on his nephew's arm. His keen eyes scanned the table at a glance."], [107, "A Bit of Paper. 95 ' Ho ! breakfast half over ! Well, so much the better. Mine will be speedily dispatched. I want a few words with Norman before office hours. Selina, see that Betty keeps to her own territories. I will have no eavesdroppers.' Miss Sedgwick took the hint and shortly withdrew, after placing coffee and comestibles within her brother's reach. She had been trained to obey his behests, but she looked as if she would have liked to linger where she was. Norman had risen to open the door for her to pass out, and saw a smile of satisfaction break over her set features, as she went with head erect and spine as stiff as her brother's. her morning gown of plain black merino, emphasising her spare form, and falling in long straight clinging folds to her feet, regardless of any fashion but her own. 'Well, nephew,' began the old man, when they were left together, ' is your mind at rest respecting Uncle Theobald ? ' Norman, who had resumed his seat, looked across the table with questioning hesitation. ' Have you not been taught to regard him as hard and relentless ; a cantankerous old savage, fit only to herd with wild beasts. A griping, grasping miser, who let his brother live and"], [108, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 96 die in poverty whilst he gathered and hoarded with fingers that stuck to coin like birdlime? Has not that been your creed from childhood until now? Answer me.' ' It has, and it has not,' answered Norman, with incisive promptitude, looking his questioner in the face without flinching. ' My father had no word too bitter for you. My mother never a word in your dispraise. In my early youth I took his bold assertions for gospel. As I grew to manhood I weighed her silence against his wrathful asseverations, and made my own deductions.' There was a sort of grunt from the easy chair. ' It was not long before my father's miserable end \u2014 I was about sixteen \u2014 when I asked her if you were as harsh and vindictive as he con tinually affirmed \u2014 ' ' Well ? ' interrupted the grim catechist, with fierce avidity, ' and what was her response ? ' ' One I can never forget. She burst into tears, hid her face in her hands, and sobbed out, \" God only knows ! He was warm and generous when I knew him. If he is changed, it is as iron heated in the furnace is chilled and hardened on the anvil by the blows of the"], [109, "A Bit of Paper. 97 hammerman ! \" \" But father calls him a skin flint, a petrifaction ! \" I persisted. She looked up with mournful eyes, and said, with a heavy sigh, \" There are petrifying springs that will turn a silken glove, a tuft of moss, to shapeless stone. So softest hearts may petrify.\" \" They are encrusted, not petrified,\" I argued; \" if you broke the stony mass you would find the glove or the moss within, changed, but still there.\" \"Even so,\" she assented; \"but people judge superficially, and take the seeming for reality.\" \" Then you think my father is mistaken or un \u2014 \" She interrupted me. \" Norman, there are some things a wife cannot discuss, even with her son. The subject is painful. Do not renew it.\" I respected the interdict, but knowing my father, as I say, I drew my own deductions.' As if to neutralise the effect of his one passionate outburst, Theobald Sedgwick had set his face rigidly, and listened mutely, meet ing the steadfast gaze of his nephew as if he had been a client detailing a case. But Nor man's scrutiny was close, and he detected a slight quivering of the muscles round the lips, a nervous clutching of the lean hand on the arm of his chair. VOL. I. G"], [110, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 98 ' And those deductions ? \" he put quietly. 'As they led me to accept your hospitality you need not ask them. It is rather for me to inquire what grave misapprehension, or what monstrous wrong broke the close bonds of brotherhood, and extended the isolation to the widow and her son ? ' A sudden spasm twitched the rigid face. ' You say truly, it was a monstrous wrong ! ' broke hoarsely from the thin white lips. He stopped short. ' Stay, I forgot myself. How am I to reveal to my brother's son the misdeeds of his father, seeing that the long-suffering wife spared his memory, and you the shame,' he cried, deep lines of pain puckering his face. ' Yet she could only have known in part, or her forbearance would have broken bounds. Alas ! poor girl, she paid dearly for her credulity !' Norman grew excited. ' Why have I been kept in the dark ? And what should you, who held aloof, know of my mother's sufferings or forbearance ? ' A grim smile flitted across the elder counte nance.

Yet he answered steadily : ' I was but a boy at the time, but I know that to dear Aunt Selina we owed a home secure from the harpies my father brought upon us ; and that my mother's first music pupils came through her, even when' she had herself been withdrawn and estranged from us \u2014 \" brutually, cruelly,\" my father said.' The speaker's sensi tive nostrils expanded as he uttered this, and his hand pressed heavily on the table. ' Young man, don't repeat to me that scoun drel's words! Yes, I was so \"cruel,\" so \" brutal,\" as to carry her away before her last sovereign had been clutched to pour molten down his throat, or to rattle away in the dice box. Six hundred pounds had gone before I came to the rescue ; yet he bruited abroad that I had carried his sister off against her will, to keep her gold within my own avaricious grip. You had a bad time after that, for he was like a raging demon ? ' Norman started to his feet. ' Unhappily, yes ! But how did you, so far away, learn this ? ' asked he, astonished and agitated.

' ' Ah, that I should like to learn. We had an unknown benefactor, some old friend of my grandfather, who, through his solicitor in Lin coln's Inn, not only took upon himself to article me to Messrs Sharp and Robins, but to pay over to my mother a sum month by month, more than equivalent to any salary I might otherwise have obtained.' 'Ugh ! I think while he was doing, he might as well have found the for your stamp at once, and not fettered you with the payment as a fine afterwards !

And what right had I to expect a stranger to lay down even \u00a360 or for me ? What he did gave me a chance to help myself to the rest.

I can never for get my deep obligations to him.' During this protest the lawyer had drawn his green and yellow silk pocket-handkerchief across his mouth once or,twice as if to wipe his lips. With quite a change of manner, he said at its earnest close, \u2014 ' Well, well, Norman, if you think so, I'll not gainsay it. The nearer the better. There ! ' he added, with a curious smile, after fumbling in his waistcoat pocket and fling ing something across the table, ' there is a bit of paper that may help you to qualify at once if you can pass the November examinations.' Norman unfolded the ' bit of paper.' It was a cheque for .\u00a3150. He had been standing. He dropped into his seat dumbfounded. ' I cannot accept this, uncle,' he began ; ' I was not prepared for \u2014 \" Sharp was the interruption.

This was an extinguisher for Norman's im pulsive outburst of independence, the result, no doubt, of proud antagonism fostered in youth"], [114, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 102 and hardly yet eradicated. The impulse had been momentary. Theobald's lowering brows, not less than his own swift consciousness, suggested the unwisdom of rejecting the hand held out to him in amity so palpable. If the hard rock had softened at his sympathetic touch, was it for him to plug up the generous fountain at its source ? Was it for him, after all his lonely years of rigid self-denial to compass the bare sum needed to place him on the rolls, to fling back to the donor the gift that meant an ' Open Sesame ! ' to the temple of his ambition, and freedom from chafing economics in the future, merely to satisfy a tradition that was proving itself a myth ? Had he not made the first over tures to friendliness in his letter to Aunt Selina? How should he turn round in the face of reci procity so overwhelming and say so ungra ciously, ' Keep your money ; I would rather work, and wait, and pinch myself a year or more than be beholden to the man my father said you were, even though I feel it to be false ? ' Should he not rather recognise the generous act in one so long estranged, so much maligned. He had still his eyes upon the open cheque he held in both his hands, when he said, in a"], [115, "A Bit of Paper. 103 much less steady voice, and without lifting his head, ' Pardon me, Uncle, if for a moment I lost sight of my early obligations to a stranger, overpowered by generosity so great, so utterly unexpected from you.' 'So repugnant to your pride, you mean,' thrust in the old man. ' Well, I don't mind a little independence \u2014 when it does not over-ride common-sense. Put the cheque in your pocket and make no more bones about it' Norman coloured. The shaft had gone home. He stumbled over some words of thanks which he felt to be quite inadequate. ' There, there, there, that will do. I'll take thanks for granted. You see, the devil's not so black as he's painted. Now, not another word, pocket that paper and hear me out, for I have something to say. It is this, I know of a good opening for just such a straight forward young fellow as yourself, as managing clerk on a respectable salary, where, after a time, there might be a chance of partnership. But, mind you, it is a country practice and might not suit your town-bred notions, your inclinations, or more ambitious views.

If you think you have better prospects in London, there is an end of the matter. But let me know, and now ring the bell for Betty. I hear Jack beating the devil's tattoo on the doorstep. Bromley will not be far off. Now silence. I don't tell my affairs to the four winds \u2014 or to women \u2014 which would be as foolish. Hark ! there is Bromley's voice. And here comes Betty for the office keys.' A frown and a growl put a stopper on every further attempt of Norman to refer to the subject. In little more than half-an-hour he had taken leave of his strange uncle, seated in his high backed chair by his office fire, and of his tearful Aunt Selina on the doorstep. She had volun teered to be his guide to the Moorland station, but was checked by a sharp ' Stay where you are ; do you think a young fellow of his inches wants an old woman at his heels to set him off on a journey like a schoolboy ?

' I am very sorry to leave both you and"], [117, "A Bit of Paper. 105 uncle so soon,' were the audible words with which he took her lean and trembling hand in his strong clasp ; but his glance put an out spoken significance into the context, ' I shall carry grateful memories of unlooked-for kind ness away with me.' He pressed a farewell kiss on her angular cheek, left a whispered ' All's right ' in her ear, said ' Good-bye ' with fervour, released the hand he grasped, knowing he was understood, and was off with his umbrella and carpet-bag, which Mr Bromley, at the window, thought Jack Reid ought to have carried for him."], [118, "106 CHAPTER VII. BY THE SAME TRAIN. The lower windows on either side of Theobald Sedgwick's street door projected some ten or twelve inches over the stony footpath in a broad, shallow bay. This was a convenience to Mr Nicholas Bromley, whose desk and high stool were close to the window-ledge, behind a wire blind. He had only to rest his elbow on the desk, with the slightest inclination of his body to the right, whilst he nibbled the feather of his pen or the back of his thumb nail in cogitation, and he had not only the immediate doorstep, but the whole length of the street northward as far as the projecting angle of the churchyard wall full in view. It was thus he had witnessed the demon strative and unexpected arrival of Norman Sedgwick under the auspices of the Squire, and thus he watched his departure on foot without so much as a lad to carry his bag for him. This set him thinking. The arrival and presence of his governor's"], [119, "By the same Train. 107 nephew ; his admission to legal consultations and the acceptance of his opinions, notably in the case of Stubbs v. Redfern, had filled the susceptible breast of the clerk with grave apprehensions. A note of alarm had already been sounded by the premature descent of old Theobald from his sick-room, and his disconcerting survey of the newly dusted deed-boxes, no less than his curt reception of explanations. But when the nephew, ' fresh from the London law courts,' stood side by side with his grim uncle in seem ing friendliness, the alarm was intensified. 'It is clear the old fellow suspects some thing,' he cogitated, nibbling at his thumb nail, and twiddling among his waistcoat buttons with the fingers of his other hand. ' He must have sent for that long-headed long shanks to supersede me without warning. It's devilish provoking. If they had only left me another month or two undisturbed, I might snap my fingers at them.' His bushy brows drew closer as he ruminated : ' I have got everything in train so naturally, but pre cipitation might defeat all my plans, and a rupture here, at this juncture, would be fatal. It is irritating to deal with a nature so reticent"], [120, "108 The Slowly Grinding Mills. and so suspicious as old Sedgwick. If I could only ascertain what really brings that pragmatical puppy here, I should see my way clearer. One thing is certain, I must let no grass grow under my feet, and I must keep both eyes and ears open.' Yet, although a small rent in the faded baize on the clerk's side of the communicating door between the offices had enlarged of late over a convenient chink, and Jack's out-door errands had multiplied, the week went by without his hearing a word at which he could catch to confirm or dispel his fears. Uncle and nephew seemed to argue and debate with more obstinacy than courtesy, but their wordy wars terminated without any actual quarrelling ; and that perplexed him, for his governor appeared more than ordinarily per verse and irritating. Of himself, Nicholas Bromley, young Mr Sedgwick had taken so little notice it was hard to decide whether his easy in difference was accidental or intentional. ' Hang him and his lofty airs ! He might think he was master here,' had said the clerk to himself, when his own attempts at familiarity and good-fellowship met with no response."], [121, "By the same Train. 109 ' What, going already ! ' he ejaculated under his breath, in surprise and pleasure, when the slight bustle attending farewells and departure met his ear on the Saturday forenoon, through the door so conveniently ajar. ' His lordship has not made a long stay of it, after all. Hark ! what's that ? Oh ! so Miss Selina must stay where she is, must she ! U-m-m. And not even Jack sent to carry his travelling bag ! Ah, there he goes, laden ! I need not have alarmed myself about him, that's evident. The old bear has not sent him away too civilly. He'll not want to come back here in a hurry. I may make myself content.' It did not occur to him that ' the old bear might be throwing a wily fox off the scent, or that Miss Selina was bidden to 'stay where she was ' from any other motive than untowardness. Yet Norman, whose lips were sealed, might have found his aunt's presence em barrassing under the circumstances ; and the road to the railway station called for no guide. It was a sufficiently broad and traversed highway through the length of the village street. True, a narrow green lane, dotted with villa cottages here and there, did diverge"], [122, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 110 on the right beyond the Rectory garden. But his way lay to the left, beyond church and schools, where the road made a bold sweep past Dr Elliot's grey stone house, where a red lamp projected from the cornice above the surgery door at the corner, and shone at night like a danger-signal. A useful signal flinging its significant light across the open on to the green shrubberies and the angular grey shoulders of the three detached houses occupying the outer curve. Beyond the doctor's \u2014 and only broken by a narrow street trending back towards and past the churchyard \u2014 the main road was lined for a short distance with newer dwellings in close rank, all of modest proportions and flush with the footpath. Then the houses became scattered and more picturesque, trailing off beyond the wayside public-house, where children dabbled in the horse-trough, and the sign, ' The Jolly Pitman,' swung aloft on a tall pole, and so on away to a comfort able farmstead, and a few humble labourers' cottages perched upon the high bank, where the last trace of tree or hedge was left be hind, and only the hard angles of the little railway station in the background broke the"], [123, "By the same Train. 111 monotony of the rugged moorland through which the highroad had been cut, before the iron road was thought of. That morning's private interview with his Uncle Theobald had furnished Norman with ample material for weighty consideration. Yet, as he went over the ground with firm steps at a swinging pace, with deep thought in every lineament, he looked about him right and left as if the village had acquired more than a passing interest now that he was leav ing it. He found himself speculating on the char acter of the lectures and entertainments at the Institute behind him, on the quantity of business done by the slow shopkeepers, and the quality of the goods in their small paned windows : on the age of the ' New Inn,' where plate-glass made no show; on the occupations of two men in earnest con versation on its broad, semi-circular steps ; on the reason why the long-nosed woman dusting cushions in the church porch should put them down and watch him so intently. And then, turning his head involuntarily to the right, as if to take a farewell view of the old Rectory, where the mantling ivy"], [124, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 112 was in better case than the red and ragged Virginia creeper on the garden wall, he thought himself the luckiest of the lucky, for there, at an upper window, stood Irene Preston and Octavia Stanfield, waving their hands to him. Cumbered as he was, he could not well take off his hat, but he flourished his umbrella vigorously, and bowed twice or thrice in acknowledgment That casual glimpse of two fair faces sent his errant thoughts on another ramble, and though Dr Elliott almost rubbed shoulders with him as he turned the corner, and called out, 'What! are you off so soon? Highfield will go into mourning. A pleasant journey and a speedy return, Mr Norman!' the in terruption was but momentary. A pony-phaeton, standing in front of a house in the row beyond the doctor's, attracted his attention to a brass plate upon the door \u2014 ' Miss Croft, Dressmaker ' \u2014 which door, or his eyesight had deceived him, had just closed on the sable skirts of the widowed Mrs Copeland. It seemed to him as if nearly all the new acquaintances he had made in the village came within his view in that mile-and-half walk to the station, as if with a last appeal to be graciously remembered."], [125, "By the same Train. 113 The importance of Highfield railway station was not to be estimated by the dozen or so third-class passengers then waiting on the plat form for the forenoon trains, but, as Norman had leisure to observe, for its colliery traffic. Heavy trains of laden coal-trucks stood in waiting on sidings, with empty ones along side. There were turntables and intersecting points on the main line in connection with a branch curving away across the barren moor to the west, where huge heaps of coal and cinders, and a grim, tall, wooden skele ton showed black against the grey sky in close proximity to a great smoking chimney, and proclaimed at a glance the mouth of Stanmoor pit, even if the long rows of low cottages on the north-west, and the long waggon coming thence toward the station, filled with lines of men and women, had indicated nothing to the stranger. But it so chanced that the previous day, Squire Stan field, remarking that it was little more than a good mile walk down Moorside Lane and under the railway arch to a colliery of which he was part owner, had introduced him to the one be fore him as a novelty to a Londoner. So it had been a novelty, and so had been the lowly homes vol. 1. h"], [126, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 114 of the pitmen, where trim beds, and polished chests of drawers with gorgeous trays a-top, had shone conspicuously through the open doorways, suggesting a contrast to the fetid slums where the labouring masses of London herd together perforce, paying dearly with hard-earned coin and precious lives for what is not accommodation. Not that all pit villages are perfection by any means. He had already secured his ticket, and after a second glance at the waggon, with its gaily dressed freight and baskets, suggestive of marketing, had begun to think what a wide sweep of road seemed to embrace Highfield within its outstretched arms, and of the dip in Moorside Lane, whilst the highway to the station was on the level, when he encountered a couple at the door of the ticket office, in whom he recognised the Squire's rosy-cheeked lodge-keeper and her sweetheart, evidently in their Sunday best. It so happened that he had casually men tioned to Miss Octavia the pitman's un expected salutation at the gate, and this had led to a little story of true love thwarted by a stern parent in the guise of Nelly Trench's father, who opposed the match, not on the"], [127, "By the same Train. 115 ground that Ben delved under the earth instead of on its surface, or that his was a dangerous calling, but because his Nelly had not been brought up to live among hard swearing pit- folk ; and, worse than all, Ben was a Scotchman, and in his sight 'a furriner.' Besides, he said, there was no knowing what the chap had been up to, made him run his country. Nelly, whose faith in her sweet heart was not to be shaken, had gone in tears to Miss Octavia, with whom she was in high favour, and the young lady, moved by the girl's distress, was doing her best to knock down the old gardener's five - barred gate. She had inspired her unmarried sister, then staying with friends in Scotland, not far from the place of Ben's nativity, to institute inquiries. These had resulted in high hon ours for Ben, who had shown his bravery in more than one colliery disaster, and had kept his aged mother until her death, when he quitted Scotland in his grief. ' I don't believe in insurmountable ob stacles, Mr Norman,' Miss Octavia had said, with animation. ' Here were the topmost bars down, as I told Trench, and I have set myself to remove the others. Mrs Copeland's"], [128, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 116 son had two neat cottages standing together on this side the moor, quite away from the pit side village. If honest Ben can have one of these, Nelly may buy her wedding-gown, for I shall talk Trench the obstinate over.' The air of triumphant possession with which Ben tucked Nelly's arm within his own brought this conversation fresh to Nor man's recollection. . The smiling pitman again bade him ' Guid day,' to which he responded, \u2014 \u25a0 ' So you two are off for a holiday. You look very happy over it.' ' Hout, sir, an' ye'd look happy.

I'll wark my airms aff or my ain guidwife sail stint o' comfort' Just then Mrs Copeland's pony -phaeton drove with a dash into the open space out side the station railing, and the widow, alighting in haste, came through the turn stile on to the platform without passing through the ticket office. 'Oh, I'm glad I'm not too late! ' she ejacu lated ; then, smiling and nodding to Nelly and her swain, she placed her hand in Nor man's, and said in a tone of relief, \u2014 ' Ah, what a fortunate chance ! I shall have a travelling companion. You do not know how much I dislike travelling alone. And I could not well ask Irene to accompany me to-day.' ' I shall be proud to serve as a substitute,' said he. 'Had I not better obtain your ticket? Mine is a second-class, but I \u2014 ' 'That is of no consequence. I have a shareholder's ticket. Any class will serve, so that I do not travel alone. I am dreadfully timid and nervous.'

' It was backed. There was a bustling exchange of passengers and luggage. Nor man handed Mrs Copeland into an empty compartment, disposed of his bag and um brella, and seated himself opposite to her. The gates and the waiting waggon were full in view. ' Do you know,' said she, with a shudder, as she settled herself, ' I never see a vehicle waiting behind those gates but I picture the havoc there would be if the train was too swift and the gatekeeper too slow.' ' Precisely the same thought had occurred to me as the gates swung back within an inch of the leader's nose. It was a close shave,' said Norman ; ' but I should have thought familiarity would have set you at ease. In town we duck under horses' heads, and wind in and out between vehicles to cross a street when the traffic is congested, in a manner that would appal a stranger. It is all familiarity and use.' ' Nothing familiarises me with danger. I was never a brave woman, and I think the"], [131, "By the same Train. 119 very care my poor husband took of me de stroyed what little presence of mind and self reliance I had. It is a shocking thing to feel alone and helpless, Mr Norman.' ' We \u2014 el, perhaps it is at times dispiriting. One needs to brace one's energies up to fight the shadows. Purposeful work is the best cure for loneliness. Of helplessness I am no judge.' ' Ah, yes ; but you must have energies before you can brace them up. And what purposeful work can a woman in my posi tion find ? I have not to earn a living ; servants keep my house in order. My dear husband is lost, my son away. I am not stu dious or talented : books and music, tatting and crotchet, cannot fill the vacancy or dissipate the dreariness. There is no one to work for, look for, or amuse. Men have a host of dis tractions, go out into the world, rub shoulders with one another, in the attrition strike out sparks as between flint and steel. Women with no absolute necessity to work sit in doors and chafe if energetic ; if otherwise, sit and brood in solitary listlessness until they grow nervous or melancholy. It is very sad.' She sighed heavily as she said this, and, looking dreamily from the window, failed to"], [132, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 120 detect the touch of irony in Norman's mono syllablic answer, ' Very ! ' He had no experience of melancholy nursed by luxurious helplessness. He thought of his own mother, so frail and delicate, turning her one accomplishment to account, then of the sturdy women on the pit bank he had so recently seen shovelling and carrying coal. He was not sympathetic. Had he known whose sentiments she was uttering at second hand, he might have been. As it was, he endeavoured to shift the conversation. ' I presume you are not travelling far, seeing you are not cumbered with luggage ? ' ' Only to Colborough. Miss Octavia Stanfield \u2014 and other friends \u2014 insist that sables foster melancholy, and urge me to cast aside my weeds. So although forget fulness is not possible, I am bound on a shopping expedition.' Norman's thoughts at once flew to the happy couple travelling to Colborough in the same train, also on a shopping expedition, and spoke of Miss Octavia's interest in them.' He had introduced a topic of which"], [133, "By the same Train. 121 neither seemed to tire, and he saw Mrs Copeland in a new light. In her kindly interest in Nelly and her sweetheart, Ben, and her hopes that they would live long and happily together in her son's cottage on the moor, her simple-minded perplexity what would be most acceptable to the young people as a wedding gift, and her friendly eulogies of Miss Octavia's warm hearted energy and shrewd penetration, the disconsolate widow vanished and he beheld only an open-hearted, open-handed woman, amiable and unselfish, if somewhat weak. The Mrs Copeland he assisted to alight at Colborough was a very different person in his esteem to the Mrs Copeland he had handed into the train at Highfield, when he would have been well content with his own society. Her unstinted praise of Miss Octavia, and her genuine admiration for a character so diametrically opposed to her own, had con verted the ' bit of a bore,' into a charmingly companionable woman. And when the train steamed away from the quaint old borough, he indulged in reveries very foreign to the life problem his uncle had set for him to work out."], [134, "122 CHAPTER VIII. life problems. To avoid disturbance from short-distance passengers coming in and out, Norman had ensconced himself with his back to the engine in the corner farthest from the platform, and there he sat with his knees crossed, looking through the window, seeing not the landscape slipping past, but a face last seen at a Rectory window, with a smile of recognition on the lips, a look of sadness \u2014 or he thought so \u2014 in the black expressive eyes. Another smiling face had been framed in the same picture, but its loveliness was only half-developed, and he contrasted the ingenuous girlishness of the blonde with the full-hearted frankness of the brunette, with a nonchalant smile for the one, an un questionably yearning sigh for the other. All the hours he had spent in Octavia Stanfield's society, every word that had"], [135, "Life Problems. 123 fallen from her lips seemed coming back to him afresh, and to sting him with the reflection that all was of the past, a memory to him only. Could it be possible that she, richly endowed in all respects as she was, would keep a place in her memory for the passing acquaintance of a week, the mere lawyer's clerk, who owed his very reception to his family connections, not to his own position or merit. Yet something in her farewell look, some thing to which he could give no name, tempted him to hope otherwise. But why hope ? Was he not going farther away with every mile into a world where love and soul-lit eyes could have no abode with the struggling aspirant for professional place ? This brought him, with aching brows, to think over and consider the life-problem his uncle had set him to work out, involving as it did, a nice point of honour with respect to the return or retention of the cheque thrust upon him. But Miss Octavia's face intruded strangely on his deliberations, adding to their complexity, and interfering with calm reflection. He was alone. There was nothing to"], [136, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 124 hinder him taking the cheque from his waistcoat pocket, and spreading it out for contemplation before his somewhat dazzled eyes. 'Well,' said he to himself as he refolded and placed it in his pocket-book along with the unchanged bank note, ' I can hardly realise that this is mine. But is it mine ? Can I honestly and honourably accept this from Uncle Theobald ? What does this sudden generosity mean ? But is it generosity or the working of late repentance for old injustice to the dead ? Rather a thousandfold he had solved the enigma of the past, and kept his gifts for those who are free to accept them. He must have known what a temptation he laid before me. I had told Aunt Selina what I was struggling to compass. And now I have the means in my own possession. But what of the country clerkship and the probable partner ship ? He surely does not think I am so blind that I cannot see his drift Well, it would heal old feuds, and Aunt Selina was tremblingly anxious to achieve that end. And it would bring me nearer to that glorious girl. But there, I must not let"], [137, "Life Problems. 125 Octavia's eyes blind me to common-sense. Yet \u2014 ah, what would I not give to bask in their light for ever ! ' The train stopped, and a porter turned the door handle for a lady who hurried past to the next carriage. He gave himself a shake. ' This will never do,' went on his ruminations. ' If I am to succeed as a lawyer, I must relinquish all thoughts of love for years to come, and I must keep far away from Highfield and the incom parable treasure I should covet in vain. I am dreaming again.' Another shake. He stretched out his long legs and leaned back. ' Let me see ; what are my chances in London ! A mere door-plate will not pull in a practice. Robins & Sharp have promised me the overflow from the office, if I decide to leave them ; but I don't build much on their promises ; and Gammon, the special pleader, has offered to give me a lift ; but he is not altogether to be counted on. I have more hopes from the interest of Gifford, our old benefactor's attorney. By-the-bye, I wonder who that mysterious benefactor could be ? I have heard nothing"], [138, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 126 of him since the term of my articles expired, and my mother's death absolved me from accepting favours for myself. Mr Gifford said he took umbrage at my determination to make my salary keep me ; but I know he approved, and if I lost one friend I made another. I'll go to Lincoln's Inn on Monday and ask his opinion of my uncle's proposal. I expect he will say, ' Bury yourself in a country village ! Abandon your prospects in London ! Not to be thought of, my boy, not to be thought of.' But \u2014 in that case I must return the cheque ; I could not possibly retain it. And I must work, and study, and wait, and economise for many months to come before I can take the world on my own shoulders. It would be a dis appointment to Aunt Selina as well as Uncle Theobald \u2014 and \u2014 a \u2014 Octavia Stanfield would forget my very existence. Hang it, the more I think, the more I am perplexed.' And so it was. He arrived at his journey's end without solving the problem which was to determine the current of his life. Sunday passed and Monday morning came to find him still undecided. He was not vacillating by nature, but he"], [139, "Life Problems. 127 had ambition. His fellow-clerks, his very governors, had predicted for him a promising career. But that presupposed the metropolis for his arena. It must be a weighty con sideration to turn the balance between London and Highfield for a town -bred man with aspirations. Mr Gifford was not to be met with until the Wednesday. He was a little grey-headed gentleman, with quick, bright eyes, and spectacles which he seldom wore save for professional pur poses. He held them folded in his right hand upon his knee, whilst he listened to Norman Sedgwick, his left hand shading his eyes, his elbow resting on his writing table. 'Well, my boy, and what is it you want to know ? ' he asked, when, with one reserva tion, Norman had laid his perplexities before him. ' Do you want to shift the responsi bility of your decision to my old shoulders. ? ' ' Not so, Mr Gifford ; but I wish to learn from you the cause of the cruel estrangement between my father and my uncle. If all my father said was true, I cannot accept this cheque as a tardy attempt at reparation ; still"], [140, "128 The Slowly Grinding Mills. less could I think of quitting London to bury myself in any country office at his bidding. If he be the one wronged and maligned, as I have some reason to suppose, I should feel in honour bound (cheque or no cheque) to devote myself to his service.' ' Very creditable sentiments, Mr Norman, very. I regret my inability to disclose the facts within my knowledge, since Mr Theobald Sedgwick has not thought proper to enlighten you. But, to prevent further misunderstanding, and the perpetuation of ill-feeling, I take upon myself to declare that your uncle was in no wise to blame, and whatsoever was the griev ous wrong \u2014 and it was grievous \u2014 he was the sufferer, not the doer. If he grew hard, sus picious, and crotchety, as I have heard, he had bitter cause. His present generosity towards yourself I regard as something mag nanimous. I can say no more. I have no authority to say so much. And, begging your pardon, you must think out your own case, London versus Highfield, for yourself.

Yet in London, men of energy and acumen push and thrust each other down"], [141, "Life Problems. 129 in all professions, and without influence or money, the young solicitor is apt to find the road to success heavy and heart-breaking. If you decide to commence practice in town, you can depend on my good offices, so far as they may go. But, to my mind, it matters little ivhere a man does his duty so long as his duty is done. Success is as often found in the byways as in the highways.' And the solicitor's bright eyes seemed to look the young man through. ' I thank you most sincerely, sir, for what you have said. You have relieved my mind of a great load of doubt concerning my uncle ; though the mystery is as great as ever. There is, however, a something else I would ask if you are free to disclose it. I long to learn to whom I was indebted for the stamp to my articles, and for all the other favours you are alone cognisant of.' ' That must still remain my client's secret, until he please to remove the embargo. Good afternoon.' So saying, Mr Gifford rose to his feet, as an intimation that the conference must terminate.

We left Mrs Copeland on the platform at Colborough, where Ben Saunders and his sweetheart also alighted from' the train. For the lady, whose face and shareholder's ticket were well-known, a ready porter hailed a hackney-coach. The miner, whose homely features were all in a glow of rapturous delight, simply tucked Nelly's arm within his own, and walked off with her down the incline and into the town, as if desirous all the world should know she was his, and how proud he was of it. Colborough, the county and assize town, on the banks of the River Cole, looked down upon by a venerable castle, and more venerable cathedral, although of no con siderable extent, was at all times toilsome"], [143, "Life Problems. 131 to traverse on account of its steep hills, and cramped thoroughfares, more especially on market-days, when the surrounding pit villages sent in their contingents to disburse their quota of the fortnight's pay in and around the central market-place. It was singular Mrs Copeland should have selected so busy a day for her shopping expedition, being, as she said, so timid ; but it was not singular that she should come across the sweethearts more than once, since the principal shops clustered around the market-place, and none were too ex clusive for the miners and their money. True, she stepped into a quiet confectioner's in a side street for a dainty luncheon, a glass of wine, and two or three macaroons, whilst Ben conducted Nelly to a cook-shop to dine off savoury goose and potatoes, not caring to take her into a common taproom. Before that, her conveyance had set her down at a jeweller's, and, whilst she was hesitating between the purchase of a set of gold shirt-studs and an Albert watch-chain, Ben led in blushing Nelly to be fitted with 'a braw gowd wedding-ring.' There was no apparent reason why she"], [144, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 132 should have been disconcerted by their entrance, but she blushed almost as vividly as did bashful Nelly, and brought her selec tion to a precipitate conclusion, dropping her voice as she gave a hasty push to some of the bright things before her, and said, ' I will take those.' If she had wished to avoid observation, she should have spoken louder, for the shopkeeper, in uncertainty, raised his voice to make sure, \u2014 ' Thank you, Mrs Copeland ; which did you say, the studs or the chain ? ' There was some slight annoyance in her answer, ' Both.' It did not escape the jeweller, but he only repeated his thanks, put the articles up in neat little boxes, took up the lady's bank note and gave the change \u2014 bowing low as she hurried away without a second glance at the couple behind her. ' How provoking,' she muttered to herself when once in the street ; I might as well have brought Irene or Miss Croft with me. That girl is sure to tell Octavia what I was buying. Well, if she does, it is no business of theirs. It is the only way in which I can repay an"], [145, "Life Problems. 133 obligation. Still, I would rather \u2014 dear me, how rudely the people jostle ! ' She need have been under no apprehension ; Nelly was too much engrossed in the import ant business before her to notice anything else. It was not until Ben gave her elbow a jog that she turned to drop a curtsey to the retreating lady. He had seen, but had 'just kenned the lady was buying jeemcracks for th' young maister,' and thought no more about it. Ben had insisted that Nelly should have the thickest ring on the tray which would fit her, as if he thought she would be bound to him the surer and faster, and he laid down his money for his purchase with none of the hag gling over prices he displayed later on, when the ' plenishing ' had to be bargained for. ' Why, here's Mrs Copeland again,' whis pered Nelly to Ben as they walked into a large double-countered draper's shop, when their dinner was over, ' and she's looking at coloured silks and satins. Happen she's going out of mourning. I hope she'll not think as we's following of her about' Mrs Copeland knew better. The draper's shop overlooked the market-place, and did the"], [146, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. \u25a034 most extensive trade in the whole town. Be sides, her little annoyance had disappeared with her luncheon. So, when she had added to a long list of purchases a black silk dress with violet satin stripes, which the shopman assured her was the newest Parisian style, and whilst waiting for her bill, she watched, with some interest, Nelly's wavering choice between bright coloured materials and serviceable ones. The latter carried the day ; a sapphire blue merino was voted ' neither too dark for the occasion nor too light for winter wear,' as she whispered to Ben \u2014 adding, ' Miss Octavia bid me buy something sensible, and to choose my wedding-gown as the old vicar's wife did in a book she lent me.' Mrs Copeland stopped them as they were crossing to the opposite counter for calicoes, sheeting, etc. ' Have you bought your bonnet, Nelly ? \u2014 No ; then leave Ben here and come with me.' Nelly followed to the show-room all in a flutter, and when they returned, a pretty straw bonnet had been found, ready trimmed with white ribbons for a bride. ' Now, Ben Saunders,' said Mrs Copeland, ' I have made a little present to Nelly, I"], [147, "Life Problems. 135 should like to contribute something towards the furnishing of your home, as a mark of goodwill to both \u2014 something useful, that shall last your lives.'

Mrs Copeland smiled. ' Ah, Saunders, I fancy gratitude is less durable than iron. I have found it fragile as glass or china, ready to flaw or go to pieces at a touch. We will see if your memory or my gift will last the longest. You know Mr Steele's shop, Nelly?' ' Yes m'm ; the ironmonger's by the bridge ? ' 'Well, you can go there when you have done here. No doubt I shall find something both essential and durable to set aside for > you. She left Nelly and Ben hardly breath to thank her, and was gone before they could"], [148, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 136 fairly say what they felt. They had taken the letting of the cottage as an especial favour, since it had smoothed the way for their union. Best part of an hour went before the weighty matters of towelling and bed-clothing were bought and paid for, after hard bargain ing, out of Ben's money-bag (a rag tied round with a string), and Nelly had invested in stout aprons and a few bits of finery the balance of her Octavian capital, and then they betook themselves to the ironmonger's for more bargaining. There is furnishing and furnishing. A miner's cottage is sooner supplied than his master's kitchen. Ben scratched his sandy whiskers, and Nelly opened wide her eyes when the ironmonger pointed out the goods set aside for them. ' Did Mrs Copeland mean all them things for us?' gasped Nelly. 'Why, we'll not want much more, Ben. Look at this lovely tea pot, and isn't that tray fine ? And feel what a heavy kettle, and big pot !

I should be sorry to have a blow from it. But is there nothing I can show you on your own account? You will need knives and forks and other little odds and ends to set up housekeeping.' ' Ou, ay,' assented Ben; 'the lassie kens maist aboot siccan gear. An', Nelly, ye need na stint yersel' wi' siccan a hantle o' things to the guid. Finch and Cowan telt lees whan they said Mrs Coupland had grown mean an' stingy. We's hae anither tale to tell.' And, glowing with grateful indignation, Ben turned his attention to the proud busi ness of the hour."], [150, "138 CHAPTER IX. LINKS IN A CHAIN. By what curious coincidence was it that Mrs Copeland, walking leisurely up the long in cline to Colborough Station should reach the platform barely two minutes after Nicholas Bromley's breathless ascent by the steep and trying steps ? Could it be that, sitting on the watch at the smoke-room window of the Railway Inn, in jovial good fellowship with the colliery agent's clerk, he espied the widow pass,, and suddenly recollected that ' the five o'clock train was due, and the best of friends must part ? ' At all events, there he was on the down platform, waiting to be seen and recognised. It was no part of his policy to thrust himself prominently into notice, and no part of his policy to let himself go unnoticed. 1 Ah, Mr Bromley,' exclaimed she as they"], [151, "Links in a Chain. 139 came face to face, ' is that you ? May I ask if you are returning by this train ? ' He assured her he was, and at her service. ' Then fortune has favoured me a second time to-day. You must know, Mr Bromley, sjie went on, all in a flutter, ' I am a dreadfully nervous traveller. It is an unprecedented circumstance that I ventured by train to-day without a companion. By the merest chance I encountered Mr Sedgwick's nephew on the platform this morning, and he gave me the support of his presence, I have been detained later than I anticipated \u2014 and \u2014 a \u2014 ' 'It is really a rough day for a lady to travel alone,' put in Mr Bromley with promp titude ; but if my presence can allay your fears I shall count it an honour to attend you. Excuse me one moment' He darted into the ticket office, came back with a first-class ticket, and was by the widow's side again, in time to preserve her from the jostling of a rough crowd of country people, rushing in at the last moment, with their laden bags and baskets, to scramble for places as soon as the train came to a stand still. A first-class carriage emptied. Into that"], [152, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 140 he handed Mrs Copeland as if she had been a queen and he her humble servitor ; and after her a large parcel a boy had in waiting. ' I am not surprised at your timidity,' he observed, as he followed and closed the door ; ' these pitmen and their wives are dreadfully ill-mannered ; they push and thrust with no consideration for a lady. And, pardon me, but I think you should scarcely venture into Colborough on a Saturday without an effici ent protector.' He said this with so grave a face that the simple widow began to think she really had done something rash or improper, and sighed over her own helpless need of such pro tection. If it did not occur to her that scores of unprotected women were, even then, thread ing their way through the crowded streets and markets, making their hebdomadal pur chases without fear or danger, it must be remembered that she had passed nearly her whole life in a quiet country place where every second face was familiar to her, and that she had never been under the necessity to depend on her own exertions, or to con front a crowd alone."], [153, "Links in a Chain. 141 Hers was no solitary case. How many women of the upper classes, hedged round by solicitous service, attention, and etiquette from infancy to womanhood, would, thirty years ago, have ventured out alone into the crowded streets of the metropolis without shrinking? And if at the present day our girls have grown more self-reliant, it is due more to new methods of training than to relaxation of etiquette, or stronger natural forces. Our faculties become enfeebled by disuse, or contrariwise strengthened. There are, of course, natures constitutionally feeble, but even these may be invigorated by judicious exercise. Is not the delicate touch, the brilliant execu tion of the accomplished musician, one half due to laborious and incessant exercise of sensitive fingers ? Dares the most distinguished song ster to relax for a single day the exercise of the delicate vocal organs that echo the soul of harmony within ? Do not our athletes train special muscles to special service by constant use ? Bind up a limb and keep it bound, and note the consequence. In marrying a wife somewhat younger than himself Clarence Copeland had selected one"], [154, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 142 likely to lean upon him for support, though fully able to stand alone if left to do so. And, in his idolatry, he had so shielded her from contact with the world as to develop nervous tendencies dormant in her system. Miss Octavia Stanfield had done something to rouse her to exertion and active use of her natural powers since her widowhood, as witness the driving of her ponies ; but con tact with Nicholas Bromley was numbing her awakened faculties like the touch of a torpedo. She sighed and almost apologised to him for her venturesome excursion. ' I had a little private business to transact, and some shopping that would have taxed the patience of an un interested person, or I should really not have gone into Colborough by myself. My going on market day was quite an oversight. Neither Miss Preston nor Miss Octavia Stanfield would have felt interested in the selection of common ironmongery for a pit man's cottage, even as a wedding gift for their favourite Nelly Trench. And it would have been unfair to ask busy Miss Croft to leave work unfinished merely to assist me in the choice of drapery, even if I could have offered payment for her time.'"], [155, "Links in a Chain. 143 This excuse was certainly formulated on the spur of the moment, though why she should make so elaborate an excuse to her lawyer's clerk was not apparent. It was not designed as a proclamation that the stable slough of widowhood was to be cast, still less to parade her generosity, if he for a moment thought so ; but, as he very speedily discovered, was due to innate consciousness that her true errand needed a disguise. ' Nelly Trench ? Let me see, is not she the Squire's buxom lodge-keeper ? I think I have heard something of her grave father's objection to her marrying a pitman.' ' Yes ; but Miss Octavia and I have suc ceeded in smoothing away his objections, and the girl is to marry Ben Saunders about Mar tinmas, now close upon us.' ' I think the young couple have reason to be extremely grateful for such gracious inter cession ; ' and now he sighed. ' It is always cheering to hear of obstacles cleared away from the pathway of devoted love. But it is easier for rough-grained men like this pit man to hammer down barriers in their way, than for men of more refined character and sentiment, who dare hardly lift up their eyes"], [156, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 144 towards a beloved object, still less seek the intervention of strangers.' He said this with an air of resigned acquiescence to fate ; and then, as if to turn an embarrassing subject, began : ' You will have placed the young people under a double obligation by your uncommon generosity in helping to furnish their home for them. I trust you will never have occasion to repent your liberality. Your own servants must be deeply attached to you, Mrs Copeland, when your good-feeling overflows even to the dependents of your friends.' ' You forget, Mr Bromley, that Saunders is as much in my employ as in Squire Stan field's. But \u2014 that reminds me \u2014 ' and she hesitated. ' I took the opportunity when I was in Colborough to-day, to \u2014 to make a little purchase, which you will oblige me by accepting. It is the only way in which I can show my estimation of your valuable services.' She had been fumbling in her small hand bag as she spoke, and now placed within his hand the larger of the two boxes the jeweller had so neatly papered up. He closed his hand upon the gift, though"], [157, "Links in a Chain. 145 he did say, as if by way of disclaimer, ' Oh, madam, if you will only honour me with a place in your esteem, I should hold it as the fullest repayment for any little service it may have been my privilege to render.' ' It is only a trifle \u2014 ' she began. ' Only a trifle ! ' he echoed with emphasis, gazing, as if in enraptured amazement, upon the trinket in its bed of cotton-wool. ' Ah, madam, your goodness is overpowering. Who but your gracious self would have supposed the mere clerk worthy such a priceless offer ing ? I shall treasure the gift to my dying day as a precious memento.' He raised the golden chain to his lips, and looked with appealing humility up to her as if to say, ' It is all I dare.' She crimsoned ; all in a flutter at what a wiser woman might have called audacity, and resented on the instant. The inferential act, in its very unexpectedness, deprived Mrs Copeland of her self-possession, and left her powerless to utter a word. At that juncture, much to the relief of her em barrassment, the train came to a standstill at Highfield Station, and she put an abrupt stop to a trying situation by rising to quit the carriage. vol. 1. k"], [158, "146 The Slowly Grinding Mills. The movement was anticipated. A mere ' Pardon me,' which might have two mean ings, and he was on the platform assisting her to alight, and securing her parcel. Thomas, who had the phaeton in attend ance, opened wide his blinking eyes when Mr Bromley handed his mistress to her seat and half-wondered if the lawyer's clerk, who had been so much of late at Moorside House, ' was going to take the reins, and his place on the high seat beside her. He smiled so confoundedly, and she looked in such an uncommon fluster,' as the old fellow said in confidence to the cook when recall ing the incident a few weeks later. However, the man gave quite a contented grunt when Mr Bromley merely raised his hat with a deferential bow and stood aside, whilst he touched up the ponies to lengthen the distance between them. For a minute or so Mr Sedgwick's clerk remained standing where he had been left, watching the vehicle down the road ; then, with a peculiar smile of self-satisfaction spreading from the thin lips under his coffee-coloured moustache to the green-grey eyes, he looked down on the pasteboard box"], [159, "Links in a Chain. 147 still in his left hand, gave it a firm clutch, and thrust it into the breast-pocket of his coat, with something of a chuckle. A smart downward twitch was given to his waistcoat, and he was striding along after the retreat ing phaeton, buttoning his overcoat as he went, and congratulating himself on the pro gress he was making. ' You're in luck to-day, N. B., thanks to your own sharpness.' Thus he apostro phised himself. ' I put this and that together very cleverly when I saw Thomas driving home without his mistress, and Miss Irene Preston coming along with Miss Octavia. I knew if she was not staying at the Rectory he must have left her at the railway station, for the eleven o'clock train Sedgwick's nephew left by.

The \" private business \" that sent the timid little woman into Colborough on a market-day, and for once without an escort, was never the pur chase of ironmongery for a common pit man, or his sweetheart ; if she thought me green enough to swallow the story. The gold chain was a tell-tale. If she went to a draper's it was not to renew her mourning. And she need not have been afraid to take a friend there. No ; I'd bet odds the private errand was to the jeweller's. And whether she knew her own motive or not, it augurs well for me that she made her little golden purchase on the quiet. A token how she \" estimates my valuable services ! \" You are getting on, N. B. But didn't you startle her ? Well, it would set her thinking ; and thinking in her loneli ness, of a good-looking fellow whose services are \"valuable,\" and whose devotion is ap parent \u2014 would not be in favour of widow hood.

But it was not until he was alone, in the privacy of his own room, that he took the gold chain from the flat cardboard box, weighed it in his hand, examined the hall mark and the workmanship, and adjusted it across his waiscoat in front of the skimpy looking glass, as if he had been a young lad of eighteen. As he gazed admiringly, his big white teeth gleamed as palpably as the chain, and he deliberated for a few moments : ' Shall I wear this to-morrow or not. It's a costly article for Sedgwick's clerk, and I don't want to excite curiosity too soon. But who is to know it's not Brummagem, or that I did not buy it myself in Colborough to-day? I need not let old Sedgwick see it, or he'd be curious where the money came from ; yet it will never do to treat the precious gift ungraciously. The giver's name need not transpire if she prefers to keep it dark ; and if she makes no secret of it, why should I ? ' ' Goodness me ! How fine Mr Bromley is to-day !

But here comes the Squire an' the ladies ; and if there isn't Nelly Trench coming after them, with a face like a poppy, alongside that Scotch sweetheart of hers ! I wonder what brings them here arm-in-arm so confidently ? Nelly was a Wesleyan. Having given a bob of a curtesy in rever ential homage to the great people, she glided before them to open the Squire's crimson curtained pew, as sedately as if never an irreverent thought could flit across her brain under that sacred roof. Then, after throw ing a pew or two open for Major Bathurst and less imposing personages, such as Dr Elliott and the maiden ladies from The Hollies, leaving the strangers \u2014 Saunders and Nelly \u2014 to find places for themselves, the black maypole of a woman went back to her post beside the inner doors, some five"], [163, "Links in a Chain. 151 feet from the Gothic entrance, as if the solemnity and importance of her office, as ' doorkeeper of the house of the Lord,' alone engrossed her mind.

I wonder if she got so tired yesterday she can't come to church this morning. Oh ! here she comes with Miss Preston, and what a colour she have got. That's with hurrying ; ' and again there was a noiseless movement to open a pew-door, whilst the clerk ushered the Rector from the vestry to the reading-desk, took his own place below in the old oaken three-tiered pulpit, and the service commenced. The publication, in due course, of the banns of marriage between Nelly Trench and Benjamin Saunders set one item of Mrs Pratt's wonderment at rest, and her tongue tied thoughts at work.

Service over, she opened the baize-covered inner doors to let the well-known congregation stream away, and kept a sharp look-out for con scious countenances ; but her poke-nose pro clivities were at fault, and she had to content herself with whispering to Nelly as she passed with Ben, after waiting, for manner's sake, to give the gentry precedence, ' Goodness me, Nell, you kept it mighty sly.' However, in that whisper, she lost an oppor tunity. She missed the raising of her lodger's hat and the expression in his eyes, when Mrs Copeland passed him halfway down the churchyard path, and the lady's change of countenance as her glance rested for a mo ment on his watch-chain. Had Mrs Pratt seen either, she would have founded a whole chapter of wondering theories thereon. A week later she had a subject for private speculation, when Mrs Copeland appeared at church in a violet velvet bonnet, a black velvet mantle, and a flounced silk dress striped with violet satin. Scarcely could she contain herself until her"], [165, "Links in a Chain. 153 good man, after closing the church, hung his hat upon a hook in the narrow passage at home.

' My goodness ! and sit mum-chance all day as you do ! No, thank you, Jacob. But you didn't see her shake hands with Bromley at the church gates.

What had Mr Bromley said to make Mrs Pratt so curious ? Merely paid a compliment which others echoed within a few minutes. ' Allow me to congratulate you on a most desirable change,' he had said, with a glance at Mrs Copeland's new attire. ' If I may ven ture the remark, you look ten years younger in your coloured bonnet.' The pleased response had been merely, ' I am glad you think so.' No more, no less. He raised his hat, as if to say, ' I will not detain you ; ' and she passed on, to encounter Mrs Stanfield and Miss Octavia at the gates. ' You did well to take my advice. The change improves you wonderfully. Does it not, mother ? '"], [167, "Through the Rain. 155 'Certainly it does. You are looking like your old self now,' assented Mrs Stanfield. Then followed Irene Preston. 'Oh, Mrs Copeland ! What a love of a bonnet ! Have you told Clarence you were discarding your mourning ? He will scarcely know you when he comes back,' she said, in an undertone, as if conscious that dress was not a subject for dis cussion at the church gates on a Sunday morn ing by the Rector's daughter, however many of Eve's daughters might keep her in countenance. ' No, I have not told Clarence yet. Most likely I shall when I send him the studs I bought him in Colborough the other day.' ' Oh, have you bought a present for him ? He will be so pleased. Well, tell him we all thought it time you cast off the dismals ; even Miss Sedgwick said so. Ta, ta !

She had an inner conscious ness of going into the jeweller's to buy a suit able gift for Mr Bromley, in order to relieve her own mind of an obligation, without a single thought of Clarence. And she was forced to admit to herself that but for the unexpected entrance of Nelly Trench, who might chatter, she would never have said ' both ' in answer to the shopkeeper's ' which ? ' The gift to Clar ence had clearly been an impromptu after thought But what could have suggested the need of a screen for her other purchase ? And why should Nelly's observation or chatter affect her ? She did not care to be under an obligation to Mr Sedgwick's clerk ; and since he was too honourable or disinterested to accept payment for his services, she was perfectly justified, in deed could do no other than compensate him for loss of time in such way as should not offend his delicacy. Surely no one could mis take or impugn her motives ! Just then she recollected the kissing of the chain in the railway carriage, and, startled by the reminis cence, she flushed hotly. Surely he had not misinterpreted. If he had, what might not"], [169, "Through the Rain. 157 Clarence think ! Her cogitations were not quite satisfactory. She reached home in a state of perplexity. Millinery had occupied her mind during the previous week, yet not wholly to the exclusion of other and bewildering suggestions. As she stood before her toilet-glass taking off her bonnet, she lingered complacently for a minute or two, contemplating the general effect in the light of the compliments paid to her. ' Well, I think I do look better, but surely not ten years younger. Mr Bromley must have been flattering.' In any case the flattery sent her down to the Sunday's noontide dinner in the best of humours with herself and all around her. And when she sallied into the drawing-room after the repast, with its large chimney-glass before her, she could not well avoid noting the com pact figure Miss Croft had set off with so much skill, or the lively tinted flouncing of her ex pansive skirts, or the dainty lace substitutes for the mournful muslin collar and under-sleeves. ' It suits me admirably. How my poor dear Clarence would have admired me in it' And then she sighed, and walked to a window looking out on the little frequented"], [170, "158 The Slowly Grinding Mills. lane ; and then she sighed again, shivered, put up her shoulders, and felt less content with her dress since there was no one on her own hearth to admire it. She sat down to the piano, but she could only play sacred music, and that made her melancholy. The oval centre-table was strewn with illustrated books and magazines. She turned over one after another, then went to a bookcase to make a selection. In a very short time that was flung aside with a weary yawn. She stirred the fire, and seated herself in a crimson rep lounge beside it, looking at vacancy. ' Dear me,' she murmured after a while, glancing at the ornamental timepiece on the marble mantelshelf, whereon a golden figure of Time sat on a revolving globe, symbolically mowing down the hours with his scythe ; ' dear me, how extremely dull and lonely it is here on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing to do and no one to exchange a word with. How some people can pore over books by the hour I cannot imagine. I wish someone would come in just now, and relieve the wearisome mono tony. It is a dreadful thing to be alone in the world. Ah, me ! '"], [171, "Through the Rain. 159 No one did call. The hours slowly wore themselves away in that peculiar Sabbath afternoon hush which pervades a childless country-house from which the master is absent. Mrs Copeland had no pets ; no lap-dog, no bird. The tortoise-shell cat, dosing and blink ing in front of the huge kitchen fire, had been banished her presence since he laid ruth less claws on her tame canary, whose cage was still empty. Negro was the nearest approach to a domestic pet ; but although she would stroke his head caressingly for the sake of his young master, she was half-afraid of the great black retriever's admission to her drawing-room since his whisking tail had made havoc among the china treasures on a what not. His home was an outdoor kennel. No. She had given her life to husband and son. She filled the heart of the former and they filled hers, as they also found occupation for mind and hands.

But that afternoon her solitary cup and saucer awoke painful reminiscences, and before she had swallowed the second mouthful she burst into tears and wept copiously. ' Dear me,' she said at last, when the tearful storm had abated, ' I seem to grow more nervous and repining as the months roll by. I wish my dear boy was at home again. I am lost without him.' But it did not cross her mind how much more nervous she had grown since Mr Bromley had so respectfully sympathised with her lonely position. He did, however, obtrude upon her musings that evening more than once, as she recalled one sympathetic phrase or other, and could not shut out from her vision his reception of her golden gift. ' It was very strange behaviour. I do hope the young fellow has not been falling in \u2014 oh, no, that is too preposterous. He has certainly been most attentive, and most anxious for my well-being, and so very sorry for my helpless state ; but \u2014 oh, dear no.

No doubt he will come when he has some of the rents to hand in. He cannot presume to come here as a private visitor. And yet, oh dear me, he does make an evening pass so pleasantly. Ah me ! ' It had not suited Mr Bromley's long head to make too many of Mrs Copeland's evenings ' pass so pleasantly,' or he had rents received sufficient for an excuse. He had awakened her to the fact of her solitariness, her helpless incapacity for business, and his chivalrous devotion, and he left the yeast to ferment. He knew there would be a reaction towards quietude after the abnormal party-giving epi demic in honour of his governor's nephew, and had already decided to let the long autumnal evenings do his work for him, VOL.

Besides she will have millinery and the wedding of the much-favoured pitman to occupy her thoughts for a week or two. With this golden gauge of her \"estimation\" in my possession, I can afford to wait till the chain is strong enough to bind her to me,' was his argument. So another and another week went by. He was as attentive to office business as of old, if not more attentive, now that the old lawyer was on the spot with keen eyes and ears alert, and limbs growing stronger day by day. He did not neglect the interests of Mrs Copeland among her tenants ; but he gave his spare evenings to chess with Mr Armstrong, the viewer, to the reading-room [or lecture room at the Institute, of which he was a pro minent member, and he kept away from Moorside House. As if to play into his hand, the rain came down persistently all the latter part of this second week, and had not ceased on the Sunday."], [175, "Through the Rain. 163 An open phaeton is a delightful vehicle for fine weather, and so long as Mrs Copeland could drive about with one of the Miss Stanfields or Irene Preston by her side, or even alone to make morning calls, life had some zest. But when the rain rained every day, it was ' Ah me ! ' and ' Ah me ! ' Needlework, books, music, were tried in turns, to be in turns abandoned. A fit of diligent overhauling of plate, linen, china, and other household stores did carry her through one wet day ; but the long evening, with the rain beating against the casements, sent her spirits down to zero. She took refuge in letter-writing, and Clarence, her chief correspondent, had the benefit of her morbid outpourings, as he had hitherto been treated with all the chit-chat and news of Highfield \u2014 Mr Norman Sedg wick's advent and departure, the flutter he had caused among the unmarried young ladies, the extreme kindness of Mr Sedgwick's clerk in overlooking her tradesmen's bills, the large sum he had been the means of saving her, the overdue rents he had collected, etc., etc., and the relief it had been to her.

Return post had brought her son's thanks for the present, and his content that she should change her robes, since that could not change her loving heart. But the rain had come before the post, and would not let her deliver his messages to Irene, or do anything that was cheerful ; and so her Saturday's letter to him was little better than a wail over her loneliness, and a longing for his home-coming.

Miss Sedgwick, who never permitted weather to interfere with her outgoings, had left her convalescent brother to the care of Betty, and, cloaked to the feet, had put in an ap pearance at church that morning for the first time after long absence. As Fate would have it, she had some trouble in replacing her goloshes when ser vice came to an end, but she reached the porch in time to observe, at the end of a line of umbrellas, her brother's clerk handing Mrs Copeland into her phaeton, and care fully buttoning the cover over her knees. It was certainly only a common act of courtesy, one her brother's clerk might naturally perform for his governor's client ; but though Mr Bromley's umbrella impeded the view, and he was on the near side of the phaeton, she thought he shook hands with the lady, and that as if not for the first time."], [178, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 166 She stood stock-still for a moment, with her umbrella half opened ; then, shutting her lips up tightly, stalked down the flagged pathway looking straight before her, as close a counterpart of her grim brother as if they had been twins. Something had gone wrong. Neither the lawyer nor his sister courted familiarity, still less interference with their affairs. Hence it happened that no one made any allusion to Mr Bromley's collector ship in their hearing, it being assumed that he acted with his governor's cognisance, and that another slice of business had fallen to Theobald Sedgwick's share. But Miss Selina had been watching Mr Bromley for some time, and nothing was too trivial for her observation. Nearly a month had gone since she posted her letter to Norman, and, herself unseen, beheld her brother's clerk, in dandified array, march along Church Street, as if he owned the ground he trod upon. Not Mrs Pratt could have been quicker to connect that evening with the hand-shake in the phaeton. ' I'll not disturb Theobald until I'm sure,' she decided, promptly.

If so, he put a stopper on that with his fine speech ; and, if I'm not blind, he did someone else a good turn with no intent. He has let light into my old eyes to day.' Shrewd as she was, the spinster's sus picions fell wide of the mark. Whatever had been his original ambition, he was not then contemplating a partnership with Lawyer Sedgwick. He had seen Mrs Copeland's face brighten when he stood ready with umbrella open to escort her from the church door to her con veyance, and shook hands with him so cordially before driving off. And he judged"], [180, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 168 the time was ripe for his reappearance at Moorside House. ' My goodness, Mr Bromley ! You're surely never going out again to-night ? Why, it's raining cats and dogs ! ' exclaimed Mrs Pratt. as her lodger donned his overcoat, and shook out the folds of his best umbrella in the nar row passage on the Monday evening. 'Well, I've rather an objection to wild cats, Mrs Pratt, and am not a dog-fancier, but I was not brought up to shirk business for a shower of rain.' And away he went, followed by the inquisitive eyes of his land lady, who, with her apron thrown over her head, braved the cats and dogs to follow his movements. As if determined to baffle curiosity, instead of turning down the street, he made the north-west circuit of the churchyard, as if bound for the railway station, or somewhere in that direction ; and she went back, ' won dering,' to her household duties, wetter if not wiser. No sooner, however, had the lodger, in whom she took so much interest, rounded the schools and Dr Elliott's prominent abode, than he turned southwards down a narrow"], [181, "Through the Rain. 169 thoroughfare parallel to Church Street, and called Back Lane, where the humbler in habitants of Highfield were chiefly located. Here he made several calls, and gave re ceipts in rent-books where the quarterly or monthly rent was ready, and sharp words where it was not. But instead of turning back when he had made his last call, or availing himself midway of the common out let to Church Street, he left the cottages behind and crossed the rising moorland in an oblique direction to a private path, only open on sufferance as a near cut, through Copeland's wood to Moorside House and Moorside Lane, taking his chance of finding the low whitewashed wicket unfastened. Pleasant enough in daylight and sunshine, when gorse and straggling heather were in bloom, was that irregular footway over the unreclaimed patch of moorland lying between railway and village, but scarcely desirable or discernible in darkness and pelting rain. Still, it cut off a wide corner, was remote from curious observation ; and if the lighted back windows of the main street on his left grew dimmer as distance widened, he was little likely to go astray, even in the"], [182, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 170 dark \u2014 so firm and hard, so different to the tread from the spongy ground on either side, was the cinder-path under foot, laid down by Mr Copeland with no inkling by whom it would be trod hereafter. However much Mr Bromley might affect to despise the rain, he was by no means sorry to see the white gate before him, or to find the latch unchained. But a loud anathema escaped him on discovering that there his umbrella must come down or be torn to tatters by unaccommodating boughs, leaving him no better shelter than dripping fir and pine\u2014 a small item overlooked in his calculations. Nor had he calculated how rugged and slippery would be the descent of the high, steep bank to the level road, over outcrop ping roots and sodden vegetation under the sombre trees, where the narrow path at best was but a succession of natural steps at various heights and intervals, where matted roots held the loose soil together.

His first slip in the wood, which had brought him to the ground heavily, had been answered by a long low growl, that told the intruder watchful Negro was on the alert. Anon, there came a short sharp bark as footsteps slipped again ; but the clashing of the gate seemed to rouse a whole chorus of resonant barks from the one dog's throat, as if in prescient warning.

Can it be you on a night like this ? ' exclaimed the widow, in tones of surprise, her hands clasped tightly together, when he stood on the hall-mat, and Thomas shut out the rain.

Mr Bromley had calculated on giving to the widow ocular demonstration of the de voted loyalty that defied wind and weather in her service ; arguing that a wet overcoat would do his cause no harm.

Still less had he calculated on the alarm he"], [187, "A Slip in the Dark. 175 had created, or on the heartiness of his reception when he dissipated that alarm. Could he have beheld his own deplorably ludicrous appearance, he would have turned back from the very gate ; yet the active hos pitality his pitiable condition had set in motion was far beyond his most eager anticipations. He had never been the object of so much care in all his life. His white teeth gleamed in the lamp-light as he recognised the fact, and made profuse apologies for the 'alarm he had caused,' his ' disreputable appearance, the result of a slight accident close to the house.' But it was not until he was seated by the drawing-room fire, with a pair of the dead Mr Copeland's embroidered slippers on his feet, and a steaming glass of hot whisky toddy on the table by the side of canvas cash bag, rent-book, and papers, that he entered into a more precise explanation, as an excuse for his presumption to appear, in so unseemly a state, before a lady he so much honoured.

She had not expected to see the slippers she had worked for her husband on a stranger's feet. Whether anything of its possible import struck her as it struck him, he could only surmise ; but her face blanched suddenly, and she appeared about to faint In an instant he was up and across the hearth-rug in haste to support her as she swayed in her chair. ' My dear Mrs Copeland, what is the matter ? Are you ill ? Shall I ring for your maid ? Oh, pardon me, I feared you were falling,' \u2014 this as the touch of his arm and of her head against the gold chain across his vest, recalled her to conscious ness, and she drew herself away, only to rest her left elbow on the table, and drop her forehead on her hand, waving him back with the other.

He preferred to take the brandy decanter from the silver spirit stand \u2014 brought in for his use \u2014 and adding a dash of the liquor to cold water, offer the glass to her white lips."], [191, "A Slip in the Dark. 179 ' Pray sip a little of this, it may revive you.

Pray, do take a little more, you are really in need of a restorative.' The glass was again offered to her lips, into which the colour was slowly coming back, whilst he bent over her with a degree of concern in manner and voice which could not fail to impress her, if with head downcast she lost the expression of his countenance. He lingered there in the same position of anxious watchfulness for at least a couple of minutes after she had raised her head and pronounced herself ' better,' as if he feared a relapse, only retiring on her as surance. ' I am quite myself again, thank you.' In that minute or two the slippers had been driven into the background by the newer thought, ' How nice it is to be so"], [192, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 180 watched and cared for.

Her heavy sigh was audible if her private thoughts were not, but something of her thought might be written on her face, and Mr Bromley was skilled in cryptic read ings. He sat silent in the arm-chair across the hearth, watching her with real anxiety, for he felt that great issues depended on that interview, and he was careful not to mar his chances by precipitation. ' She is shocked at seeing how naturally I have slipped into the dead man's shoes and the dead man's seat. I must give the sentiment time to work off,' ran through his brain.

He started from his chair, took her small, plump hand in his, and dropped on one knee at her feet. ' Ah, my dear madam,' he cried, im petuously, ' you give me life. I would gladly risk falls and broken limbs, and ex posure to pitiless midnight rain, nay life itself, only to hear again such words of gentle pity from those sweet lips.' She was too bewildered for utterance. He raised her hand to his lips, as if he was doing homage to his sovereign, and raised his eyes to hers with an appealing glance that only disconcerted her the more. She had no suspicion of 'designing men,' not she, and least of all would she have suspected him. ' Mr Bromley,' she gasped, incoherently, 'I am surprised at \u2014 at- \u2014 you.

Human hearts and emotions are not under human control. Let Byron plead for me. Does he not say \u2014 \" Why did she love him ? Curious fool, be still.

He was on his feet, but, bending over her, whispered in low, glad tones, ' And you bid me hope ? ' There was no answer this time ; but again he pressed those hidden lips of his upon her hand, as if he took her silence for assent. Papers, rent-book, money, lay loose upon the table between them when Dinah appeared at the door not ten minutes later, and Mrs Copeland, pen in hand, appeared to be signing a receipt. To cover her confusion, she had elected to overlook Mr Bromley's accounts, though she ticked off the names of tenants, counted moneys, and affixed her signature with no more perception of items or totals than an automaton. Her ' Directly, Dinah,' was not very steady ; but then she had her head down"], [197, "A Slip in the Dark. 185 over the papers, and in the few minutes given to clearing away papers, and locking up money, she had so far recovered her composure as to take Mr Bromley's proffered arm and cross the hall with him into the lighted supper-room without any perceptible display of weakness. What woman, with another woman's eye upon her, cannot call up her reserve forces and present an un moved front on emergency ? So that repast, with Dinah in waiting, was but an ordinary affair after all ; and though the maid remarked that her mistress took an extra glass of wine, she had no inkling of the scene which had preceded it, and called that extra glass into requisition. Nor did the inquiries and orders about the drying and brushing of Mr Bromley's overcoat attract attention in the kitchen. Hospitality and warm-hearted kindliness had been the order of the house as long as the oldest servant could remember, and common humanity dictated common attention in a case of the kind, even as they saw it.

Was ever woman in such humour won?' He cried, in exultation, half aloud, as he had spouted it in amateur theatricals years before ; and then he paused, not caring to carry the Shakespearean quotation farther. ' Egad, as things have turned out, that slip in the wood was lucky. I took informal possession of the ground, as did William the Conqueror when he slipped on the beach at Hastings.

At the very hour Mr Bromley exchanged his wet and muddy boots for the comfortable slippers of the dead Mr Copeland, in the hall of Moorside House, Clarence Copeland, seated at the small table in his narrow study at Rugby, was penning an anxious letter to Irene Preston. Opposite to him, with both elbows on the table, and his big hands in his hair, sat his sturdy chum, Herbert, ostensibly preparing first lesson for the morrow, a lexicon and a Greek poet lying before him, but more exercised in mind over the unknown trouble of his friend and the home letter that had caused it. Irene Preston, Mrs Copeland's girl friend, had long been motherless, Mrs Preston having been thrown out of a carriage when her little daughter was not more than five years of age, and been injured beyond"], [201, "Correspondence. 189 recovery. The distracted Rector had summoned his maiden sister to take charge of his dying wife and his home ; and at the head of his household she still remained, as good-tempered, warm-hearted a specimen of spinsterhood as ever spoiled a motherless niece. At the first intelligence of the disastrous accident, Mrs Copeland had flown to the Rectory, not so much to offer her temporary services as nurse, but to carry off the sobbing little one \u2014 who distressed her agitated father by her tears, and appeared to be in everybody's way \u2014 to be comforted and caressed out of sight and hearing of the terrible trouble at home. Clarence, not many months older than Irene, had not arrived at the age which despises girls as playfellows. He was sorry for her grief, tried to kiss away her tears, brought the choicest of his toys and picture books to entertain her, and finally led her away to the nursery, where he had a fine rocking-horse for her to ride. Mrs Preston lingered, but unconscious, and Irene was not called home. At the end of a week Miss Croft came to measure her"], [202, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 190 for new mourning. The child was put into a black frock, and was gently told that her dear mamma had been taken away by the angels to live in heaven, and that sometime she would see her again, if she was a very, very good little girl, and did not distress her poor papa by crying. She was crying then, but she did her infantile best to still her sobs, and in a few weeks the world was rolling on merrily again. Motherless Irene was caressed and petted by the mother and father of Clarence, romped and raced in the large garden with him, or rambled in the woods to pick up fir-cones, with a staid nurse on guard, or Octavia and Herbert Stanfield for occasional companions. Mrs Preston had been laid to rest quite two months before the Rector and his sister finally decided that propriety demanded the child's return home. But so unwilling did they find the little maid to leave her new playmates and friends, that a compromise was effected, and Clarence invited to spend a week or two at the Rectory with her, weeks that spread into five. From that time visits were interchangeable alike between the elders and the young ones."], [203, "Correspondence. 191 But whatever fresh boy-and-girl friendships were formed as they grew in years and stature, their intimacy remained the same, yet not the same ; the childlike faith and affection deepening with years and con fidential intercourse. They were like brother and sister, and as yet no one had awakened to the probability of warmer relations between them. Irene had been the chief solace of Mrs Copeland's widowed home, spending almost as much time with her as at the Rectory. Perfectly easy on that score, Clarence had passed his terms at Rugby since his father's death with no ? fears respecting his mother's comfort. Certainly, he had noticed, during his last vacation, she referred to him small details in connection with her executorship and property, as if wanting in self-reliance. The appeal to his judgment had been flattering to his own self-importance, nothing more. Then she had been excessively solicitous about his personal equipment and supplies, more than ordinarily anxious for the completion of his studies, and final settlement at home. Her parting from him at the end of the"], [204, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 192 vacation had been marked by unwonted reluctance. And almost her last words had been, ' I shall rejoice when your studies are over, and I have you with me for good and all. You will relieve me of the business cares connected with our property. The burden is too much for my womanly in competence.' Otherwise he had no suspicion that she was less resigned, or, indeed, anything but practically happy. Conse quently her morbid, melancholy outpourings of the Saturday disturbed and set him thinking. Not without cause. A combination of unto ward circumstances must have choked the ink pot whence came reflections such as these : \u2014 ' I am weary of my own society. My solitary life is becoming too dull and monotonous for endurance. It is miserable to look upon your father's empty chair by the fireside, with nothing to distract my attention. The prospect from the window is scarcely less depressing. In fine weather what prospect is there but an unfrequented lane, a stone wall, and a thick plantation behind it ?

Poor woman ! the unhappy desolation of her lot was very real to her for the time being. So real, that not all the elastic buoyancy of youth could prevent her lachrymose epistle from weighing down her son's spirits. So real, that he shrank from communicating his new trouble to his inseparable chum, who rallied him all day on his new-born gravity. In vain he perplexed himself to discover the source of his mother's disconsolate wailings. He was not given to blunder on in the dark when light was to be had for the seeking. It had struck him suddenly that Irene's name had no place in the whole communication. At once he sat down to seek a solution from her. ' Rugby, October 24, 185 \u2014 .

I feel as if something was wrong with the moral atmosphere in that quarter. A wet day, or a week of wet days, would not account for the painful lamentations of \" loneliness and des pondence \" she poured out on paper for my refreshment last Saturday. She tells me that the \" sight of my father's empty chair makes her miserable \" ; that her \" life is becoming too dull and monotonous for endurance,\" and speaks of \" advertising for a companion,\" with much more in the same melancholy strain. You know it is not customary for my mother to indulge in querulous complainings, or I should treat them lightly. As it is, I feel as if I were guilty of a breach of confidence in quoting the above. But I confess I am uneasy, and wish to have a full report of any sudden change in her health or manner since my return hither, nay, within the past fortnight, and I know I can trust you, dear Irene, to the uttermost.

In equal concern, if with more brevity, he replied to his mother : \u2014 ' My Dear Mater, \u2014 Did you think what a damper your last would be to your son ? The rainfall of a week seemed to pour out of the envelope. Seriously, it troubles me.

In any case, you can do no harm in advertising for a companion ; only be wary whom you engage. Perhaps Octavia or Miss Sedgwick could recommend someone suitable. By-the-bye, you do not mention Irene. Surely our \" Sunbeam \" has not deserted you ? What say you to purchasing a horse and a brougham, so that wet weather need not keep you at home ? Talk to the Squire about it. And for Heaven's sake, mother, do keep up your spirits until I am back to keep you alive. \u2014 Your affectionate son, 1 Clarence Copeland.' Thursday morning brought him the expected answer from Irene. He tore it open with impatience all the greater for there being no reply from his mother. Surely she must be ill. Irene's first words were reassuring. 'The Rectory, Highfield, October 26, 185\u2014 ' Dear Clarence, \u2014 Do not distress yourself about your mother. Your alarm is quite un founded.

Now and then she certainly relapsed into silence, as if wrapped in thought. I had not then received your letter, or I might have observed her more closely. Something she did say of the depress ing influence of wet weather, and of a doleful letter she had thoughtlessly written during the downpour last week. But I must say Mrs Copeland appears to us more energetic than I can remember. It is but three weeks since she actually went into Colborough by train on the Saturday, and neither asked me nor Octavia to bear her company. She did not even take Dinah or Thomas for protection, and went about shopping from place to place quite composedly without an escort. Nelly Trench, who was there with her sweetheart Ben, had the good fortune to meet her in one or two places, and was as full of surprise as she was of gratitude for \" Mrs Copeland's gener osity,\" of which you will have heard. And only last Sunday she came to church through the rain. So you may content yourself, there is no demand for Dr Elliott. ' At present all her talk is of weddings and wedding - dresses. Nelly Trench is to be"], [210, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 198 married to Ben Saunders on November 16, and the Squire is to give them a wedding-feast in the servants' hall. But Herbert will have told you this. And no doubt he has told you that his sister Beatrice has come back from Scot land to be married to Sir John Spencer. All is excitement at the Manor House with the two weddings on the tapis. Miss Croft and her assistants are working day and night, for although Beatrice is having most of her trousseau from London, half Highfield will expect to witness the ceremony, invited or uninvited. Your mother intends to be quite gay for the occasion. She is going with aunt and me to Colborough next week to select our finery before it is all bought up. That does not look much like melancholia, does it ? Octavia and Beatrice are downright shabby. Don't you think so ? They will not reveal the appointed day just yet, even to me. Yet I hope it will not be before you two boys are home for the Christmas holidays, or it would be disappointing. ' Is my news sufficiently sunny to disperse the looming cloud? If so, you will have to make your very best bow and most grateful thanks to \u2014 Your obedient Sunbeam."], [211, "Correspondence. 199 ' P.S. \u2014 Godpapa can get about now with his stick quite easily.

But I wish the Mater herself had written,' followed, after a pause, much more soberly. It was Saturday before the widow's reply reached her son, and then it was not altogether satisfactory, though, for the life of him, he could not tell why. She was ' sorry if she had alarmed him ' ; ' her health was never better ' ; still it was ' awfully dull to mope alone in wet weather ' ; 'she had not decided yet about the companion.' Then she launched into her accounts of the expected bridal festivities, for the poor pitman and the rich baronet, her own lonely lot running like an intangible thread through all. And she did not forget to describe the great fright Negro had given them all, or the drenched and deplorable condition of 'poor"], [212, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 200 Mr Bromley,' whose fall in the woods ' might have been very serious.' Clarence, reading the letter in the School Close, laughed aloud at this. 'Hullo! What's the fun?' cried Herbert Stanfield, seldom to be found far from his chum. The joke was too good to be bottled up. Clarence, in the midst of his laughter, spluttered out, \u2014 ' It's enough to make a fellow split his sides, ha ! ha ! ha ! I say, you know old Sedgwick's clerk ? ' ' Ay , to be sure. He got me into a row with the Pater, the lying vagabond.' ' Well, here's such a lark !

' Ay, that he is,' struck in the other ; ' I wonder Sedgwick keeps him. He tried to pump the Pater once about the colliery partner ship, but he got a smack in the face from the pump-handle for his pains.

Meanwhile, a fall over a bit of orange-peel had accounted to Theobald Sedgwick for his clerk's limping gait the following morning. Even wondering Mrs Pratt was temporarily blinded, and rummaged out a bottle of opo deldoc with motherly compassion. He might thank Copeland's huge kitchen fire for dry ing his overcoat ready for Thomas's brush, and the old man's skilful manipulation of the crushed hat for keeping her in the dark a single day. But the scare at Moorside House was an event not to be passed over in servants' gossip. It reached Mrs Pratt after Sunday evening's service, and up went her hands with the breathless ejaculation, ' Goodness me ! he said he slipped over a piece of orange-peel !

It shall not be my fault if I do not teach her something more than chess. So far I have played a winning game. I visit now as the favoured friend, not the mere rent-collector.' So satisfactory was this reflection that not even Negro's churlish bark disturbed his equanimity.

Mrs Copeland, too, wore a smile. She rose and advanced \u25a0 to receive him with extended palm, and a word of welcome that merged into regret for the evident consequences of his fall. He gently pressed the offered hand, thinking the while he had never seen her look so young or pretty. She would make a charming fire side companion. Since the filmy symbol of widowhood had disappeared, she had worn her hair in the graceful fashion of the day, smoothly brushed from the crown over an artificial rouleau, so that it encircled the head like a coronal. The style became her well ; her forty-five years took the aspect of forty ; whilst the royal blue satin dress shimmering in the firelight over a slight crinoline, with touches of old lace as a relief, supplied all that was needed of matronly dignity, at the same time set ting off the plump freshness of her clear skin. She suited her surroundings well. She was"], [220, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 208 at home there, and every motion showed it. Her visitor was not so much at home, though her smiling reception should have set him at his ease. He would fain have complimented her on her appearance, but words did not come so readily as usual. The surprised admiration in his eyes was genuine, and perhaps did more for him than words. Then the little chess-table brought them into close companionship. Not only were their heads drawn nearer, bending over the board, but he found it necessary to arrest the white hand laid on knight or pawn, or with his own guide hers to make a move. Then, again, there were little pauses between the games which he knew how to fill effectively and pleasantly. And then the chess-table was moved aside, and he drew nearer, not farther apart. Then, apropos of the coming bridals, the conversation took a sentimental turn, and \u2014 the spider secured his fly. Up the steep lane that night he strode triumphantly, his head well up, his shoulders well back, his chest forward. The very"], [221, "Agreeably settled. 209 buttoning up of his overcoat had fresh ex pression. ' I feel a new man,' said he, half-aloud, as he stalked along, and bore his newness upon him. ' Won't I turn the tables on old Sedg- wick pretty sharply ? Ay,' he continued, as he grew gradually nearer the dark hill-top, and beheld a couple of close carriages, one after the other, bowl out at the gateway of the Manor House, whilst innumerable sparks of light, twinkling through sombre cedars or the airy network of deciduous trees, told of festivities within ; ' ay, it will not be long before my carriage will be rolling through those gates ; not long before Nicholas Bromley, Esq., will be hobnobbing to his crusty old governor across Squire Stanfield's mahogany. There can be no shutting me out. The colliery partnership settles that ! ' And so he went on, elate in his unhatched chicken counting, whilst the two carriages turned the Chapel corner up Church Street, and a third driving past him took its way towards Bridge End.

'If he hadn't them he couldn't throw them,' rejoined her husband, then busily screwing up a new string on his fiddle to the proper pitch. ' Goodness me, man ! you seem to care for naught but that fiddle o' yours. Happen you'll not care to hear that Dr Elliott's going to take our Asaph 'prentice, an' make a doctor on him.'

I say, Pratt, doctor must think a rare lot of our Asaph. \u2014 My goodness ! how Mr Bromley is walk ing up and down the parlour, as if he meant to wear the carpet into holes. I wonder what megrim's taken him now. He was pleasant enough when he went out. Something's gone wrong, I know.

And up went the fiddle under Jacob's chin."], [224, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 212 ' Ay, and there'll soon be a cry out for a new carpet, if my fine gentleman rampages about like a wild beast in a cage, and who'll pay for that, I wonder ? ' A flourish on Jacob's freshly-tuned fiddle drowned the wondering, and Mrs Pratt, having a vision of lost buttons before her eyes, dashed about her kitchen as if rampaging had been infectious ; muttering from time to time odd words which sounded like motherly pride in her son's promotion, or chagrin that no one shared her elation. Punctual to a minute was Jacob. If the tall kitchen clock had by chance made a mistake, Jacob might have set it right. There was not such another timekeeper in the town. Waken him at any hour of the night, and he would tell you the time to a minute. He was not likely to forget himself that morning, for little though he might say, Asaph's welfare was very near to the father's heart. It had been a genuine grief to him that his son had no ear or inclination for music, though he had made good progress at the village school, and knew as much about the wild"], [225, "Agreeably settled. 213 plants in the woods and on the moors as ever a young man in the village. Many a ' littering mess of them things ' had gone behind Martha's kitchen fire, whilst Asaph was poring over ' Woodville's Medical Botany ' to learn the properties of his 'finds.' Since the time when Jacob Pratt had taken the illustrated herbal \u2014 once the property of his wife's father \u2014 down from the kitchen book shelf to search out a remedy for some ailment of the sick lad, had he been curious to master the secrets of the volumes that could make people well. At first the finely - coloured plates attracted the boy, combined with a childish feeling of some magic in the pages he could scarcely read, some mystery he could not fathom, and it may be also a spice of hereditary curiosity. The printed book sent him to the book of nature. Many a cuff on the ear did he get from his mother for bringing clay and mud on his boots into her clean kitchen along with his plants, or for surreptitiously boiling roots and weeds in her saucepans. Asaph was little over thirteen years old when he went boldly to Dr Elliott on his own inspiration, and offered himself"], [226, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 214 as errand-boy in place of one who was leaving. o The doctor, well aware of the boy's pro clivities, as who was not, snapped at the offer, and the youngster was in his element. No fear of his loitering with physic for delivery, so eager was he to get back to the pestle and mortar, the spatula and pill boxes. The great lout,' as Nicholas Bromley called him, had been over three years with the surgeon, when he ran in hot haste to summon his musical father to a conference which, as he told his mother, was ' to make a man of him.' Dr Elliott was not a polished specimen of humanity ; few colliery doctors are. They are apt to roughen and deteriorate among rough surroundings, isolated from other society than their own and the spirit-decanter. But apart from his colliery contract, his practice extended over a wide, general area, and his genial face was as welcome at aristocratic bedsides as by the bright four-poster of the sick pitman. He was beginning to feel the need of an assistant, and he shrewdly argued that it"], [227, "Agreeably settled. 215 would be doing an equally good turn to Asaph and himself if he bound the lad closer to his own surgery, and helped to train an assistant who was assiduously training himself, and might otherwise carry his undoubted talents to a rival. Something, but not all, of this he said to Jacob Pratt when the spare little clerk, with not an unbrushed wrinkle in his rusty black garments \u2014 not a speck on his snowy shirt front or stand-up collar, not an atom too much bow in his black silk neckerchief \u2014 sat har moniously neat and unobtrusive, hat in hand, waiting the loosely - attired surgeon's prelim inary proposition before he put in a word. ' You see,' said Dr Elliott, pushing back his plate and breakfast-cup, 'a little know ledge is a dangerous thing. Asaph has just got sufficient knowledge to make him more dangerous than serviceable to himself or others, and it strikes me that unless he be properly trained and instructed, some of these days he may be turning quack, and getting into prison for poisoning some body.' Jacob listened, but made no premature sign. He had memories of a cat and a rabbit coming"], [228, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 216 to grief through some of the youngster's early experiments. 1 Still, the lad has natural ability, and it would be a pity to keep him running errands. Only yesterday I found him setting the broken leg of a chicken, and putting it into match- wood splints ; and he bandaged a girl's sprained ankle very cleverly last week. You see I have been putting him forward to ascertain what stuff he was made of, and now, although it is customary to receive a premium with a medical pupil, and to pay him nothing during his articled term, I have concluded, as you are not a rich man, Mr Pratt, to pay Asaph a small sum to keep him in clothes and pocket- money, and to further his medical education to the best of my ability, on the proviso that he shall be duly bound to me for five years, and that he agrees to remain with me as an assistant afterwards, so long as may be mutu- ally satisfactory. Asaph is willing, what say you ? ' ' Amen, and thankful, sir ! ' assented Jacob, fervently; 'I'll not say but what I'd rather have made a musician of him. I gave him his name because Asaph was chief musician to King David. Most likely there was ne'er"], [229, "Agreeably settled. 217 a fiddle in those days, for Asaph made a sound with cymbals. But our Asaph would neither sound cymbal nor violin, to be chief anywhere. So, as he hated music, and took to physic natural, I let him have his bent. And depend upon it, doctor, you'll not lose by what you do for Asaph.' ' I don't expect I shall,' said the surgeon, dryly, as he thurst his arms into a loose brown overcoat, which he called a ' wrap rascal.' ' And now my horse is at the door, I must be off. You can meet me at Lawyer Sedgwick's, two hours hence, to arrange for Asaph's articles \u2014 what you will call indentures.' ' Stay, sir. Will Asaph be a doctor right out when he's out of his time ? ' ' No, no. He would have to walk the hospitals in London or Edinburgh, attend lectures, and properly qualify before he could obtain a diploma to practise. And that would cost money.' Jacob Pratt's countenance fell. ' Then, sir, what be the good of binding him to you?' ' A doctor does not grow up like a cab bage, Jacob. Every medical student has a probation as assistant, and sometimes a"], [230, "218 The Slowly Grinding Mills. long one before he qualifies. If Asaph be steady and saving he may shorten the term. Bpt it's time enough to talk of that.' ' Ay, so it is. Plans laid long aforehand get soonest rubbed out, or Asaph would have taken to the fiddle. Yet me and my missis have not been of the spending sort, and, please God ' (reverently), ' our only lad need not be begging for a few pounds to give him a start.' ' Well, so much the better for Asaph. But I'm off' And in two minutes more the doctor was riding fast towards Stan moor Colliery, with a smile on his face at the simple clerk's ' few pounds.' Nicholas Bromley had slept off his fit of uneasy depression, and walked to the office as jubilant and elate as if he had his prize within his grasp. But he found Miss Sedgwick and her brother in the hall, with such well-satisfied smiles on both lank faces, that his elation had a sudden check, as if a shower-bath had given him an un expected douche. His conscience told him that he was walking among tin-tacks with the 'business-end up,' and he put down to some discovery or plot against himself, those"], [231, "Agreeably settled. 219 uncommonly pleasant smiles on both faces together. Then he noticed that Miss Selina had a letter in her hand. ' It could not come in answer to the one she posted overnight,' he argued. It did not. It anticipated the queries con tained in that, and told with little preface that their nephew, Norman, had paid his fine, passed his final examination, expected his name to appear on the rolls in due course, and was prepared to leave London in accordance with his uncle's proposal. Of his motives or reasons he said nothing. Most likely they defied his own analysis. There was something of gratitude mingling with a desire to compensate in his own person for the wrongs done by his father. But there was a stronger passion under lying all ; and, whether he knew it or not, Octavia Stanfield had been the chief lever to move him. What would Mr Bromley not have given to peep within that blue envelope ? He was nervous and fidgety all the morn ing. . He got another cold douche when Jacob"], [232, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 220 Pratt walked in, asked to ' see his master,' and bade Jack run out to hold Dr Elliott's horse, no horse being then at the door or near it.

' My dear Mrs Copeland, what a colour you have this morning!' exclaimed Irene Preston, shaking her hand, warmly, before seating her self. ' I only wish Clarence could see you now. He would not think of calling in Dr Elliott. I declare I have not seen you so blooming for many and many a month. You are not like the same being since you threw off those horrid caps. Your own beautiful hair is so much more becoming. Now, don't say I'm flattering \u2014 I'm only delighted, and I'm sure Clarence will rejoice at the change as much as I do.' It was always Clarence ; Clarence first, Clar ence last, in Irene's thought. 'Ah, my dear Sunbeam, it is your sweet, young presence brightens me up. I'm afraid I mope a good deal when I'm alone. Have you come to spend the day with me ? '"], [234, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 222 Mrs Copeland was not so certain about her son's rejoicing. The colour that self-conscious ness had driven to her cheeks deepened at Irene's reference to him, and she put her question in part to turn the conversation. If overnight her senses had been led captive by seductive glances and a beguiling tongue, and her womanly vanity flattered by the ardent protestations of a fairly good-looking man so much younger than herself, morning had brought reflection, and remembrance that she had a son who might not be well affected towards the life companion she had so precipitately accepted. If to a young girl the incense of a lover's adoration comes as the perfumed breath of May, it comes as the natural tribute of youth to youth. To a woman whose first love is spent, whose maturity is past \u2014 or passing, who looks only to a solitary journey downhill towards the setting sun, love comes as a refreshing draught of sparkling water from an unsuspected fount, offered to the parched lips of the traveller in an arid desert. Few are they wise enough to ask if the goblet be pure or poisoned. There is a thirst to be quenched and the lips are eager to quaff. If Nicholas Bromley had not in the first"], [235, "The Cottage on the Moor. 223 instance awakened the widow to a sense of her own solitariness, he had insidiously intensified the feeling, created a yearning for the com panionship she missed, for the helpful friend whose loving care had been around her to the last, a shield and a support. And in her loneliest hour he had come to offer a substitute for all she had lost \u2014 a young, impassioned husband to replace the old one gone. She took the paste for a diamond ; meretri cious glitter for love's pure gem. It was this had given lightness and brightness to her step and countenance. But now, consciousness and doubt deepened the bloom on cheeks and brow. She knew \u2014 she felt as if others must also know. Irene's pleasant ' Yes, if you will have me. I have brought my needlework,' did not set her more at ease. Afraid of betraying her new secret in a pro longed tete-a-tete, she proposed a walk to the Institute Library, and a call on Miss Sedgwick, but she fidgeted about with face averted as she spoke, rearranging little matters about the room in a manner that suggested discomposure even to the unsuspicious girl. At the moment Irene agreed to the proposed"], [236, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 224 walk, there was a tap at the door. Dinah showed her natty little figure there. ' If you please 'm, Nelly Trench have come to the side door, and would you please to see her, m'm ? ' ' Oh, certainly. Show her in \u2014 you'll not mind?' turning to Irene. ' No,' Irene did not mind ; so Nelly Trench, with a conscious bloom, which scarcely out rivalled Mrs Copeland's, was ushered in, and curtseying within a yard of the door, as if afraid to advance, said shamefacedly, \u2014 ' If you please 'm, Ben said, as he thought 'm, you'd p'raps like to look over our pretty little house, and see how nice and smart it is, with all the fine things you and Miss Octavia, an' Missis, have given to set us up, and he thought as p'raps you'd like see it afore we disturb it. We wouldn't have taken the liberty 'm, but to see how them things you was so good as to give us do set it off' Mrs Copeland turned to Irene. ' What do you say ; shall we go ? ' There was a ready assent. Nelly, who had been nervously twirling a door-key over her two forefingers, dropped another curtsey, and hurried off, as she"], [237, "The Cottage on the Moor 225 said, to have the door opened in readi ness. In a few minutes Mrs Copeland, fully equipped for a breezy moorland walk, with fur trimmed paletot and muff, and the much admired velvet bonnet, left the house with Irene, she as warmly, if more simply clad in a navy-blue merino, a silk bonnet to correspond, and a serviceable thick cloth jacket of a dark shade, which would stand wear and weather, yet set off the lissom figure that was seen as frequently on the threshold of the poor and sorrowing, as on the steps of the rich and prosperous. The narrow footpath was barely broad enough for their two crinolines as they walked on abreast down the hill and under the railway arch, beyond which the footpath was lost in the rising roadway, a mere cart-horse track over the rugged moor, now bleak and black under a November sky, the very gorse and ferns having a ragged, wintry aspect. Leaden, too, seemed the waters of the gliding beck which, rising somewhere two or three miles north-west of the colliery, took its erratic course round by the south, and then swept, with a bold dash, under a railway bridge, through the Stanfield grounds vol. 1. p"], [238, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 226 and lakelet, passing Highfield as a boundary at Bridge End, as the name may tell. The ladies went on chatting of this and that, personal, parochial, and matrimonial, until, after walking about three parts of a mile with the beck on their left, they came in sight of two solidly-built stone cottages, with no pre tensions to architectural beauty, and no second storey but what was indicated by a window in the gable-end, which came first in view. Yet they covered a considerable plot of ground, and had the by no means common adjuncts of out buildings in the rear for the housing of turf, coals, tools, or even a donkey if required. But what distinguished the two cottages from any in the general pit-village \u2014 visible across the moor a mile or more away, beyond the black pit-mouth, where the lines of houses were flush with the dusty street \u2014 was the fair expanse of garden in which they were set. This, which lay along the frontage and around the side of each gable, was en closed within sheltering walls of uncemented stone, divided only by the common entrance and common footpath leading to the pair of adjoining doors, and extended as far back as the translucent beck."], [239, "The Cottage on the Moor. 227 'Dear me!' exclaimed Irene, 'what a time it does seem since I was here last. It was summer then, the heather was in blossom, and Mr Copeland was here super- intending the builders, and measuring out the gardens. And I remember, as if it were to-day, his telling Clarence that he meant to build five more pairs of the cottages, not all the same size, some larger, but all fit for decent people. That they were for Clarence himself to own and to manage. He wanted to see what sort of landlord he would make. And I know he said Clarence was on no account to let a cottage to a tenant who would not under- take to cultivate his garden in spare hours, and he said that he should expect him to keep the cottages in good repair, for that a good tenant deserved a snug, warm house, and if the owner neglected his property he could not expect tenants to care for it. What a dear, kind man he was, and so thoughtful for his poorer tenants ! You should hear how they speak of him to this day ! ' The young girl's eyes brimmed with tears at the recollection, the more readily from the contrast some of the poor she visited had"], [240, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 228 latterly set up between the old regime and the new. Mrs Copeland seemed uneasy. 'Ah, yes, my dear, and Clarence holds the title to the land, and the buildings upon it ; but my poor dear husband did not live to carry out his intentions. You may see the land has been cleared and marked out, and the foundations laid for another pair ; but when he died I had no heart to go on with the building. I found that workpeople cheated me, and so thought it best to wait until Clarence himself could carry out his father's plans. You know, my dear, all I have will be my darling boy's some day.' She said this with genuine feeling and hon est conviction, little dreaming what she had herself done, or was doing, to mar her son's inheritance. They were walking up the broad garden path, paved with cobble-stones from the moor, and Nelly, with the door open, stood on the threshold of the second cottage proud and smil ing to receive them. ' See, ma'am,' said she before they had set a foot within, ' that there door-mat was made for us by Ben, his own self,' pointing to one com posed of shreds of cloth and list knitted together"], [241, "The Cottage on the Moor. 229 into a thick fell with twine, ' and that there hearthrug, too, miss. Isn't it a picture ? ' Her face was a picture glowing with proud affection. Ben had knitted into his heathrug the scarlet device of two united hearts. The sentiment and handiwork were his, and the love of two united hearts made it truly a picture to her. Alas, that ever hearts or hearthrug should be spoiled by trampling on ! Nelly listened with pride to the praises of Ben's industry and ingenuity, disturbed by no imaginative symbolisms. Then she called attention to the oven and grate, where fuel was laid for a fire, the newly polished kitchen fender and fire-irons, the bright brass candlesticks and metal teapot over the mantelshelf, the fine paraffin lamp (of which as a novelty she was half afraid) in a nook by itself, and took care to inform Miss Irene that they owed all these to Mrs Copeland, as well as the kettle on the hob, and the gaily painted tea-tray conspicuously displayed upon the new mahogany chest of drawers, bought by Ben out of his own savings. A large old folio Bible lay also upon the"], [242, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 230 drawers in front of the tray. On this Irene laid a finger, with the words, \u2014 ' Ben never bought this ? ' a remark that was more of a question than an assertion. ' No, miss. That Bible belonged to Ben's father's grandfather. He was a preacher of the Word where Ben comes from in Scotland, and he sets great store by it' ' For his great grandfather's sake or its own. Nelly answered readily with an intelli gent smile. ' Both, miss. But he says it's too precious, with all the writing inside, to be used common. We have got another here to read regular, one we'll not be afraid to handle,' and she turned towards a small shelf of books in the nook above the lamp, where, in companionship with the poems of Burns and Hogg, and a few volumes of heavy Calvinistic literature evidently coeval with the huge folio.j an ordinary octavo Bible ranged alongside Wesley's Hymns. 'Wesley's Hymns!' ejaculated Irene. ' Are we not to expect your attendance at church ? '"], [243, "The Cottage on the Moor. 231 ' No, miss, Ben have gone all the way to Colborough to meeting. But father would not let him have me till he promised to go to the Wesleyan chapel along of us.' Irene looked grave. Hers had been no narrow-minded training, still she had not learned to regard dissent with favour. Mrs Copeland put in a word. ' Ben must love you well, Nelly, if he has made such a concession for your sake.' 'That he do, ma'am. He have put up with all sorts of hard words from father for my sake. But then I love him too, you know,' an admission, comprehensive in its simplicity, which somehow set Mrs Copeland all in a tingle. She turned aside whilst a cupboard by the fireplace was opened to display a china tea-service, and other such ware Miss Octavia had supplied, and then, without a glance at their common chairs and table, and three - legged stools, Nelly laid her hands triumphantly on a handsome four post bedstead set in one corner against the inner wall, with its foot opposite to the door, saying, \u2014"], [244, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 232 'See, ma'am, see what Mrs Stanfield has given us, just when we thought we should have to put up with one of them gimcrack iron things they make now. Isn't it a beauty? I don't think there's such another in all Stanmoor village.' T really don't think there is, Nelly; you will be the envy of all the pit- wives. It is well you live so far apart, or there might be some jealousy, for we all know the four-post bedstead is the glory of the pitman's home.' ' Yes, m'm, so it is ; but you have not seen the wash-kitchen yet' And passing through a door between the chest of drawers and the bookshelf corner Nelly led the way to a smaller apartment, whence ran a narrow stair to the large attic above, and where she had ranged her pots and pans, her dels-rack, her tinware and washing - trough, her pail and brushes, with all the nicety of a new beginner. ' You will find that sink and copper con venient,' remarked Mrs Copeland, as if they were not common appurtenances, adding, after all had been duly inspected and admired, with the very faintest touch of affable condescension, \u2014"], [245, "The Cottage on the Moor. 233 'Well, Nelly, you only want the husband here to make all complete. I declare I should not mind living here myself, every thing is so nice and snug.' Irene laughed out merrily. Nelly had much ado to control her mirth as dis respectful. ' You live here ! ' echoed the pair simultane ously, as if the very suggestion was prepos terous. ' You live here ? ' repeated Irene. ' Fancy the mistress of Moorside House surrounded by servants and luxuries, finding herself like \"the old cobbler who lived in a stall, that served him for kitchen and parlour and all ! \" Only fancy it ! ' ' Please, miss,' put in the bride-elect, apolo getically, ' Mrs Copeland only means if she was a working-man's wife.' 'Yes, that's it exactly. And I'm not sure the working-man's wife has not the best of it in some respects,' assented the elder lady, thoughtfully. ' Certainly she could not \" mope \" for want of occupation, with floors to scrub and pans to scour, if that's what you mean,' suggested Irene, slyly."], [246, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 234 Mrs Copeland turned her head sharply to look Irene full in the face, blushed, sighed, and walked away hurriedly down the path ; so that Irene, who had lingered whilst Nelly told how her father had ' actually dug up and manured the ground ready for Ben,' had to step briskly on to overtake her. She could perceive that something had disturbed the ordinary equability of Mrs Copeland, and having no key to locked-up secrets, naturally fell back on the apparent, and began to apologise. ' I am sorry if I hurt your feelings in any way,' she said sincerely ; ' but the contrast between the drawing - room in which not more than an hour before you confessed to \"moping terribly,\" and the humble cottage in which you said you \" should not mind living,\" struck me as so ludicrous I was compelled to laugh. I really could not help it.' 'You might, at least, have spared the comment' ' Perhaps I might. It was a thoughtless remark, I admit. But you must forgive me.' ' Forgive you ! oh, yes, child.

Of course, I saw its absurdity as soon as you did. But there, let the matter drop.' It did drop out of conversation, but it provoked Irene's risibility more than once that day. And for a length of time the very mention of Moorside Cottages conjured up a picture of Mrs Copeland richly dressed in fur and velvet, standing on the uncarpeted stone floor complacently pronouncing the pitman's cottage a desirable residence for herself. At such times she was sure to smile ; ' it was all so preposterous.'"], [248, "236 CHAPTER XV. madame arrietta. It is not pleasant to turn out into a thick November fog in the early morning hours.

If he was wanted, it was best to err on the right side, and start without delay. His arrangements were soon made. A change of raiment neatly packed in a small black bag, a word with the laundress, a paper wafered on his door to say, ' Back in three days,' and he was ready for a scant night's rest, and whatever the morning might bring. It brought fog, cold, and discomfort. He had not bargained for them, but he had bargained with himself to catch the early morning train, and catch it he did, in spite of the fog, trusting blindly to obtain a hot breakfast at either Peterborough or Gran tham, with leisure to swallow it. He had barely time to take his ticket and"], [250, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 238 jump into a carriage a porter held open for him. There were but two other passengers in the same compartment \u2014 a burly fellow all wraps and Inverness cape, and a woman on the opposite seat, who was but as a darker shadow looming through the fog. London, the great octopus, had not then stretched out its ugly arms so very far over the green parks and fields as now, though they were rapidly feeling their way into the outskirts, and making havoc of the picturesque. The open country was sooner reached, and there the dense black cloud became a silvery veil of mist, had there been daylight to discern it. They were a silent trio. They seemed to have wrapped up their souls as well as their bodies, and to be each as self-contained as ever a bivalve with a mouth to open. Norman, indulging in as many specula tions as on his first journey north, speedily lost sight of the dark veil and thick woollen shawl opposite to him, and filled the space with a remembered pair of luminous eyes in an animated countenance, crowned with a coronal of shining jet."], [251, "Madame Arrietta. 239 He held silent converse with the ideal companion his own eager imagination had given him, in which hope and expectation outstripped sober reason, and transported him to dreamland, when the rapturous illu sion was suddenly dispelled by the pungent odour of a bad cigar in the mouth above the Inverness cape, and he was brought back rudely to the actual and present. He did not smoke. One of his small economics in the past had lain in that direc tion, and given a bias to his taste. As the circling fumes filled the closed carriage, and offended his sensitive nostrils, he bent for ward and said to the veiled figure oppo site, \u2014 ' I hope the smoke is not offensive to you, madam.' This was meant as a rebuke to the smoker, whose rudeness he considered un pardonable, although there was no remedy prior to the introduction of exclusive smok ing carriages. The close black veil was removed. A suave, well - modulated voice answered him, and set the burly smoker at his ease. ' Oh, dear no ! I rather like it. We"], [252, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 240 should get on very badly in our profession if we were fastidious over trifles, but for all that, I thank you for your politeness, sir.' Norman simply inclined his head. ' What is your profession ? ' rose to his lips, but good breeding set its seal upon the words, and they relapsed into silence. However, the ice had been broken. Pre sently, in the same tones, she asked if it would be possible to obtain a cup of coffee at Peterborough, adding, \u2014 ' I was up all night with a sick child, and having to drive from Bromley to King's Cross, had no time to think of breakfast.' ' I hope we shall,' answered Norman. ' for I, also, am breakfastless.' ' Then you won't,' came roughly from the Inverness. 'No breakfast on this side York.' 'Oh, dear, I am sorry,' she exclaimed. ' I left Bromley about four o'clock in an open vehicle, and driving through the raw damp air has quite chilled me.' ' People who travel at unearthly hours should provide against discomfort' A gurgle and an odour of whisky proclaimed how he was provided."], [253, "Madame Arrietta. 241 ' People cannot always choose their hours for travelling, sir. Railway directors and their own urgent business often decide that for them,' put in Norman. ' I do not sup pose this lady left her sick child at four in the morning, in a November fog, from choice.' ' Indeed, no, sir,' assented she. ' The time-table allowed me no alternative. I must fulfil my engagement to-night, and if I had waited hours for the next train I should be too late for rehearsal. A woman with her living to earn in public cannot always choose her own times and seasons. Nor can she afford to show fatigue or weariness. She must be at all times up to the mark, as if she had nerves of cast-iron.' There was a curious hardening of her voice as she said this, turning her face towards the Inverness cape, and at the same time into the light of the lamp. There was a start as of recognition. ' Bless my life, Madame Arrietta, is it you? I beg your pardon, I am sure. Here, take my flask. It's quite at your service. If I had only known \u2014 ' cried the burly fellow, evidently desirous to propitiate the vol. I. Q"], [254, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 242 individual he claimed to recognise as ' Madame Arrietta.' 'Thank you, sir,' she said coldly, waving him back, 'spirits are no substitutes for hot coffee. I am already supplied with sherry and sandwiches. Coffee would be more re freshing, that is all.' And again there was silence after a surly grunt from the big fellow, who had not ex pected the rebuff, and who, after another pull at the flask, subsided into the far corner and sleep. There was something in her face, when the light fell full upon it which attracted Norman's attention. Anger, scorn, contempt and bitterness, all shone in the flash of her keen, beady, orange - brown eyes, and gave an unpleasant curve to her flexible thin lips, which had a strange suggestiveness of venom behind them disguised in honey. The open brim of her bonnet displayed a mass of tangled coppery - red hair above a low fore head, broad, as was the face generally, albeit the nose was somewhat thin and prominent. It was a very composite countenance, and Norman found himself endeavouring to analyse it, and to decide whether it was"], [255, "Madame Arrietta. 243 frank or false, fascinating or repelling, whether she was five-and-twenty or thirty. She might have been aware of his un conscious scrutiny, for although she volun teered no further statements respecting her self at Peterborough, where there was a brief stoppage, and he left the carriage to stretch his long limbs, he found her on his return with her bonnet off, as if she had been arranging her disordered hair under a chen ille net. ' I am afraid I shall be scarcely present able at my journey's end,' she remarked, as she replaced her bonnet. ' I could not leave my child until the last minute, and was too flurried to bestow much care upon my toilette.' ' No doubt,' he acquiesced, ' these early trains must be a nuisance to ladies. I hope you left your child in good hands ? ' 'Very, his grandmother will care for him.' But she said this with such a heavy sigh, he wondered if her black dress and bonnet were indicative of widowhood. Whilst tying her bonnet - strings beneath her chin, he had observed a wedding - ring she wore, but less the ring than her long"], [256, "The Slozvly Grinding Mills. 244 lithe fingers, twining in and out, as he said to himself, like so many white snakes. Nor could he rid himself of the impression whilst she sat before him opening her bag and packet of sandwiches, which she ate with perfect composure and self-possession, as she took her sherry, like an old traveller. The remembrance of the days when his own fragile mother ' had a living to earn,' came back to him, and stirred his heart with pity for this other mother, compelled to quit her sick child and travel alone, ' at unearthly hours,' by the stern necessity to earn a living at the beck of an exacting public. But not for a moment did he institute a comparison between his own mother and this ' Madame Arrietta.' Mrs Horace Sedgwick had been a refined lady in tone and manner under all circumstances. Her son felt some thing of this lacking in his travelling com panion. When Peterborough was left behind day light came on with rapid strides, but that did not make the journey less cold and cheer less. At Grantham, whilst Norman darted out to make a hurried raid on the just opened refreshment - room, the big fellow"], [257, "Madame Arrietta. 245 wakened up and departed, other passengers getting in. Norman imagined he had said something rude to Madame Arrietta, her face wore such an aspect of rigid displeasure. She, however, made no remark, nor did Norman ; and little more was said until, on nearing Doncaster, he saw her collect her few belongings, including a roll of music. When the train stopped he was out first, and assisted her to alight. She thanked him with a smile, declined his offer to find her luggage, exchanged a polite ' good morning,' and threaded her way among the people on the platform with an easy sinuous movement not even her thick grey shawl could hide. As the train steamed out again, he saw her standing along with a porter, beside a large trunk, which bore tokens of travel ; and saw, moreover, that, whether vocalist or actress, she was quite capable of taking her own part in life. It was surprising how this casually-en countered stranger, whom he never expected to meet again, had broken up and intruded on his private reverie. And even when he had settled his long body as comfortably as he could in the corner, to think out his own"], [258, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 246 thoughts collectedly, he found his mind dwell ing more than once on Madame Arrietta's miserable drive through fog and darkness all the way from Bromley to King's Cross, and the hard life she must lead, whatever her vocation. This was but an occasional break in his speculations what his own life would become if spent in a country village, with his grim uncle, and his little less grim aunt, for companions, not unmingled with doubts as to the wisdom of his own decision. The ' change for Colborough ' created a diversion, and, once there, all vanished, to give place to the fair vision of a dark-eyed daughter welcoming a father, and accepting without scruple that father's newly-discovered friend. It changed the dubious character of his cogitations, and, when he leaped from the train on to Highfield platform, the last doubt was cast aside. He gave his cramped limbs a shake to set the blood in motion, threw his travelling-rug over his left shoulder, took his bag in one hand, his umbrella in the other, and walked out of the station, with purposeful energy in every limb and lineament. The moor might look black, the sky over-"], [259, "Madame Arrietta. 247 head a dirty grey ; he saw only his duty, and the possible future far before him. People and vehicles met and passed him, to be regarded with an observant eye as possible factors in the life he was about to take up, no question of his uncle's enigmatic offer having occurred to him. He began to wonder if at the Rectory window the same faces would be visible to which he had waved a farewell so few weeks ago. For, although summoned thither by a lawyer, for dry legal work, he had young blood in his veins, and love is paramount over law. As he rounded Dr Elliott's corner the church bells began to ring merrily. ' That is a pleasant welcome,' he said with in himself. ' Someone is being married.' And, surely enough, when the long school house was passed, he beheld quite a procession walking down the churchyard path, with Ben Saunders and Nelly at its head ; he proud as a peacock, with a gay necktie, a tartan vest, and a bunch of flowers in his button-hole, for which his newly made father-in-law was responsible. Norman met them at the gateway. ' So, my friend,' he said, cheerily, ' I have turned up just in time to congratulate you and"], [260, "248 The Slowly Grinding Mills. your pretty bride. I wish you both much happiness.' ' Nae fears, sir,' responded the bridegroom, proudly, ' Nelly and me hae taen ane anither for better or waur ; but gin I dinna mak it a' for the better, I'll tint my heid. Mony thanks, sir, for your guid wishes.' Nelly, with rosy face bent down, spoke not a word, but clung closely to Ben's arm, and played shamefacedly with one corner of her white shawl. Then they passed on, followed by their friends, arrayed for the occasion, Trench, and Thomas from Moorside House bringing up the rear, the former looking very much as if mak ing the best of the unavoidable. Norman had stopped to let them file out. Glancing towards the church, he distinguished from the common crowd of children and gapers, a knot of ladies in conversation near the porch, as if waiting for someone. The Rector joined them, and they turned. His heart gave a bound, for foremost came Octavia Stanfield, and she recognised him with a smile of surprise and welcome. He advanced to meet them, shook hands with her, with Irene Preston, Mrs Copeland,"], [261, "Madame Arrietta. 249 and the Rector, and then was formally pre sented to ' Miss Stanfield,' who just inclined her head as if her dignity required preservation. As they moved on towards the gate, after the first greetings and inquiries, Norman observed : ' It quite gratifies me to see what a cordial feeling exists here between employers and their dependents. It would be a strange sight in London to find a group of ladies in your posi tion present at the marriage of a servant and a working-man.' ' Nor is it common in the country, sir,' put in Miss Stanfield with some hauteur, ' but my sister has chosen to spoil Nelly Trench in all ways. I think both she and Mrs Copeland might have been contented with the Squire's treat to the couple, without dragging me hither to witness a common pitman's wedding.' ' Never mind, Beatrice dear, never a pitman shall profane the precincts of the church when you pose as a bride. We will hang a screen of crimson cloth round the outer walls, and hoist placards to warn them off,' said Octavia in mock contrition, as if soothing a spoiled child. Then to Norman she added in a different tone, \u2014 'The fact is, Nelly Trench's mother left her little girl to chance in order to nurse vol. 1.

I believe she has selected a husband well worthy of her, and they love each other most sincerely. And I also believe,' she went on, ' that if people in our position took a little more real interest in the daily lives of their dependents, there would be less fric tion and strife between the classes.' ' Ah, you always were Quixotic,' fell deris ively from a curling lip, and Miss Stanfield stepped back to the others. Norman's heart had glowed in response to Octavia's words and eyes. ' Your senti ments do you honour,' he began. ' Sym pathy is the universal touchstone of all hearts, whether they beat under broadcloth or cord uroy. As for your Scotch pitman, I must confess to a hearty liking for him since his unexpected salutation of me, a stranger, at your gate. I have had a specimen of surliness and want of sympathy in the train. But I am detaining you. I must say good morning.'"], [263, "Madame Arrietta. 251 ' Stay one moment,' she said. ' My father is giving the wedding-feast, and I have pre vailed on Mr Pratt to bring his fiddle and let them have a dance in the servants'-hall before they break up.

' Well, nephew, you do not let grass grow under your feet,' cried Theobald Sedgwick, rising and extending his bony hand, with more spontaneity than Norman had previously witnessed.

' This, sir \u2014 your proposal to me was vague ; might mean an introduction to a stranger's office \u2014 or to your own. I interpreted it to mean the latter, and in that case concluded to accept the offer with thanks.' ' Ugh ! Suppose it was otherwise ? ' ' Then I return to town to-morrow, and repay your cheque as I best can, by in stalments.' A frown gathered on the thickly - lined brow. ' You are wondrously independent, young man. But if your choice is for town versus country, what induces you to re linquish your choice, and give my office the preference? Do you look to step into the dead man's shoes ? ' Norman started, and rose to his feet. The coarse suggestion stung him. With his hand on the back of his chair, he an swered proudly and decisively, ' No, sir ; emphatically no ! I came to the conclusion that I was triply bound to you. Firstly, by ties of blood and kinship ; secondly, by gratitude for the means to qualify as a solicitor ; and, thirdly, by moral obligation to"], [268, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 256 repair in my own person, by faithful service, any wrong you may have sustained from my father in the past. On the last score alone I feel called upon to devote my best years and best abilities to your interest and well-being. In quitting London I should relinquish comparatively little. It has shown a hard front to me. Of its gaieties I know nothing. For low amusements I have had no inclination ; for higher, no means. I certainly had professional aspirations, but aspirations are not achievements.' Theobald Sedgwick had listened, nor lost a word, or an inflection, or an expression of the speaker's face, full in the light from the broad window, whilst his own was in shadow. ' Um ! It sounds well, nephew. And, pray, what did you expect from me ? ' ' What you proposed. A fair equivalent for professional service, with a prospect of partner ship. For other service I may be able to render as your ?iephew I am already in your debt' A queer smile flitted across the old gentle man's face.

Well, it's not fair to be less frank with you. I have not lost sight of you all these years. And I do want someone here, in this office, whom I can trust. Bromley is a double dealer. I must be quit of him speedily. Shake hands, Norman, we shall not quarrel about terms. I'm right glad to see your face again.' Norman was scarcely prepared for the sudden change in his uncle's tone and manner, or for the hearty grip of his hand, which might never have known a touch of rheumatism. His own surprise and satisfaction were manifest, if he said little. With scarcely a pause, Theobald began again,\u2014 ' You have come just in the nick of time. Miss Stanfield's marriage settlements have to be drawn up and engrossed. Sir John Spencer, whom she is to marry, will be here to-morrow with the Squire ; and if we can keep the busi ness clear of the clerk's office it will be as well.

How does \"Sedgwick & Nephew \" sound, eh, Norman ? ' A dry chuckle wound up the composite Speech, which at the outset had caused Norman to catch his breath ; till swiftly to his relief came recollection of the Miss Stanfield in her haughty contrast to Miss Octavia at the church gates. Dinner was served, and Miss Selina waiting. Betty had vanished ; it being against Theo bald Sedgwick's principle to give servants a chance of listening and chattering. ' I like to have my meals free for conversation, without overlookers or eavesdroppers,' was the reason assigned for dispensing with a waitress. 'Here, Selina,' he began; 'let me intro duce my new managing clerk. See you don't spoil him, and make me jealous. And now, as that's settled, let us have up a bottle of champagne to drink his health, and success to the young lawyer.' Betty was clearing the dinner- table when Mr Bromley returned to the office. The empty champagne bottle on her tray caught his atten tion from its rarity. There was no profusion under the Sedgwick roof. His forehead puckered ; his coffee-coloured"], [271, "The Close of a Wedding- Feast. 259 eyebrows almost met. He hung up his hat and overcoat mechanically and moodily. ' If such be the reception accorded to the nephew, I must waste no more time deliber ating,' he muttered to himself between his set teeth, ' or I shall lose all.

' There, I think that should do the business. And it's tolerably near to the truth,' was his mental commentary, as he stretched out his hand for a common blue office-envelope, im pressed with the ordinary wafer stamp. He addressed it in a flowing hand, very unlike his general caligraphy, and, singularly enough, to someone residing at Bromley-by-Bow, London, whose name was not that borne by the writer. Jack Reid had come into the office mean while. Seated at the far end of the long high desk, filling in legal forms from a list before him, he glanced from time to time at the senior clerk, whose absorption was something abnor mal ; and when he observed the addressed letter go into the scribe's own pocket instead of adding to the increasing pile for post, he did a bit of private chuckle to himself, thinking, with self-confident penetration, ' Ah, I knew as that was no office business. That's a love letter or"], [274, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 262 my name's not Jack. He means to post that himself Mr Bromley did mean to post it himself, but not in Highfield. No sooner was the office closed than he was off up the street almost at a run to catch the 4.40 train to Colborough. He swung himself on the footboard of the last carriage as the train was steaming out. 'Just in time,' he said half-aloud, as he took his seat ; ' and, as if luck would have it, she will be at the Manor House to-night and not want me. Thanks to the jollification over that pitman's wedding there will be no occasion to hurry back. I can go to the Crown for a game at billiards and a glance at the Era after I have posted my letter. No one will miss me at Highfield.' No one but Mrs Pratt, who had not seen him hurry past her window, and was fidgety over the spoiling tea and toast she had pre pared. She was not satisfied with her lodger's erratic movements of late, and wondered at this and at that, much to the discomfort of less inquisitive Jacob. She had not even Jacob to share her wondering with, for he was away with his fiddle at the Manor House, vigorously exercising his beloved art for the entertain-"], [275, "The Close of a Wedding-Feast. 263 ment of the couple he had, in his clerkly vocation, helped to marry that morning. In the latter capacity he had pronounced a devout ' grace ' before and after the bountiful dinner over which the housekeeper and butler pre sided in the servants' hall, and although he let the ale-can pass him and drank only water, he apparently enjoyed the repast and the fun afterwards with the best of the merrymakers. Meanwhile Norman Sedgwick had excused himself for an hour to his uncle and aunt, and when the hearty Squire in the fulness of his own hospitable satisfaction led him from the drawing-room to witness the scene in the servants' hall, cleared for the occasion, there was Jacob Pratt perched on a stout table at one end and fiddling away with all his might, whilst Saunders in the midst was capering and gyrating in a practical and demonstrative illus tration of the Highland fling, with its charac teristic vocal accompaniments. The entrance of the two gentlemen might not have discomfited either dancer or musician, but when the faces of three ladies, Mrs Copeland, Irene Preston, and Miss Octavia, also appeared in the wide doorway, drawn thither by the extraordinary 'Hecks!' and"], [276, "264 The Slowly Grinding Mills. ' Oicks ! ' of the bridegroom as much as by the inspiriting notes that set his northern limbs in motion, Jacob's bow was arrested half-way across the strings, and Saunders came to a panting standstill. ' Bravo, Saunders ! ' cried the Squire encour agingly. ' Nay, man, never look abashed, don't stop your dance on our account We came to see you enjoy yourselves, not as spoil-sports.' ' The leddies, sir,' suggested Ben, deprecat ingly, as if they had caught him in some flagrant breach of decorum. 'Oh, I'll answer for the ladies. I don't suppose they ever saw a Scotchman dance a Highland fling in their lives. Take breath and start afresh, man ; let them see you do your best for the honour of your native land. Now tune up, Pratt, and afterwards we will lead off \" Sir Roger de Coverley.\" It's getting time the newly-married people started homewards.' Thus encouraged, Jacob struck up, and Saunders took the floor again ; but whether weary with previous exertions, or awed by a solemn face behind Nelly's shoulder, he dis played considerably less agility and emphasis than during his original performance."], [277, "The Close of a Wedding-Feast. 265 Nevertheless, the party from the drawing room were highly entertained, and expressed their satisfaction without stint ; the Squire all the more loudly on account of the one glum face he had espied. ' Why, Trench, what's the matter with you ? You look as sombre as a mute at a funeral. Brisk up, and clap your hands like a man. You ought to be proud of your son-in-law's famous dancing,' he cried across the room. ' Proud ! proud ! ' exclaimed the gardener, starting to his feet all in a quiver with sup pressed passion, ' proud of a godless whirligig such as that ! He'd have been no son-in law of mine could I have thought he would have lent his limbs to the service of Sattan in such a monstrous fashion.' A murmur of amazement and dissent ran round the room. ' Father, father, don't ! ' pleaded Nelly, clinging to his shoulder, her cheeks a burning red. He shook her off roughly. ' I thought I was giving her to a decent, God-fearing man, who came of pious folk, if they was Scotch ; a chap as would bring up his own bairns in the fear and admonition of"], [278, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 266 the Lord, and I've been and sacrificed my poor lass to a sinful follower of the Evil One.' Nelly was by this time sobbing on the breast of her husband, who appeared literally dumbfounded ; unable to utter a word in his own defence. The Squire interposed. ' Here, here, Trench, we can't stand that, you know. You ought to be thankful the girl has got a steady, brave, hard-working husband to protect her ; one who neither drinks, nor swears, nor fights. Ben has been a good servant and a good son. We have not a more religious man on the whole colliery.' ' Religious ? ' with infinite scorn. ' Ay, about as religious as Jacob Pratt there, who keeps his religion for church on Sundays, and thinks it no sin to go fiddling for the devil and his dancing crew on a week day.' Another voice took up the controversy. Jacob Pratt was down from his perch. \u2022 Jeremiah Trench,' he began, ' who art thou who judgeth another ? To his own mas ter he standeth or falleth !

Let me refresh it, Jeremiah Trench, with the direct command, \" Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour,\" and remind you that the same Scripture that says \" there is a time to plant,\" says also, \" there is a time to dance.\" It also says there is \" time to keep silence, and a time to speak.\" But you can find no authority for evil speaking, and none to for bid either music or harmless dancing.' The quiet self-possession of Jacob Pratt was as oil to the furnace of Trench's wrath. Utterly regardless of place or people, he cried out vehemently, \u2014 ' No authority, do you say ?

Your narrow-minded prejudices have prematurely broken up a happy party, and brought tears of distress to the eyes of your own daughter, on a day that should have been all joy. Apologise at once like a sensible man, both to your son and Mr Pratt, for your ill-timed outburst of temper. Here is Saunders holding out his hand in amity.' ' Hout, mon, shake hands, an' dinna fash yersel' ower a bit dance. Kiss Nelly, an' say guid-nicht ; we maun gang hame noo,' urged Ben, with more good-humour than might have been expected. But Trench, whose mistaken zeal had swept down the barriers of habitual deference, re fused to see the proffered hand. ' Apologise ! Me apologise to a fiddling parish clerk ; and to a fellow who spins round like a teetotum, and flings his limbs in the air, whooping like a wild Indian, when it was more fitting he should go on his knees"], [281, "The Close of a Wedding- Feast. 269 and ask a blessing on his marriage ? Never ! If I have to quit my place to-morrow, I'll not countenance what pious John Wesley denounced. And, look you, Ben Saunders, go home and repent of the bad beginning you've made, lest it should end in your dancing on nothing ! ' Consternation sat on every face. From the moment the Squire spoke the word ' funeral,' one ill-omen had trod upon the heels of another. Saunders had much ado to preserve a show of equanimity. As for Nelly, she had fairly broken down, and not all Miss Octavia or Miss Irene could say sufficed to console her. The Squire again took Trench by the shoulder and turned him out of the hall, saying sharply : 'If you were not so old a servant I would dismiss you on the spot for the commotion you have caused. Go to the lodge, and repent you the mischief you have done.' He might repent. But there is no recall ing hasty words or their echoes \u2014 no restor ing to their fountains the tears sad eyes have shed. vol. 1. t"], [282, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 270 He had spoiled the harmony of the wedding-day.

HURRAH ! Jeremiah Trench had certainly caused a convulsion in the servants' hall by his mis taken and ill-timed zeal. He had sat out stoically two or three reels and country dances, though they set his very teeth on edge as it were ; but the force of numbers was too strong for him, and, as we have seen, it was not until his newly-made son-in-law took the floor alone, that the smouldering fuse burned down and the powder exploded. The Squire's kind - hearted announcement that he and his friends would honour the occasion by leading off the last dance had fallen on deaf ears, or the old servant had surely not forgotten what was due to his good master or to his daughter and guests. At all events, when the Squire forced him out of the room, merriment was at an end, the party broken up into groups. At the"], [284, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 272 suggestion of Geordie Gill, the groomsman, Polly Finch, the bridesmaid, was hurrying away to 'put on her things.' Nelly's sister had already made her escape to the lodge in a fright Mrs Copeland, little less dismayed, had betaken herself to the drawing-room as a refuge, whilst Norman stood there helpless, feeling himself very much out of place. He found himself watching with uncommon interest the group of which disconsolate Nelly was the centre, towards whom both Miss Octavia and Miss Irene had hastened on the first outburst. And he could not avoid noting the tact and delicacy with which the former endeavoured to soothe the over wrought emotions of the distressed young wife, who sobbed out, ' Oh, Miss Octavia, only to think that I should ever hear my own father say such awful words to my dear, dear Ben, and all for nothing. Oh, it was cruel, cruel ! I shall never be able to look my dear husband in the face again.' ' Yes, you will. Ben will have too much good sense to be disturbed by a few hot words. And in any case he will not blame you. Dry your eyes, my girl. You should not shed tears on your wedding-day.'"], [285, "Hurrah ! 273 ' I know that, miss, I know that ; but oh, it was cruel. And what will Ben think?' and Nelly's tears only flowed the faster. The group gave way for Ben, who gathered her to him with an air of generous protection, in itself an answer to her agitated query. ' Dinna greet, lassie dear,' he said tenderly, yet cheerily ; ' hard words break nae bones. I ken my ain granfaither wad hae flyted muckle waur, gin he had seen ane o' his ain kith an kin making a fool o' himsel' as I hae dune this nicht. Sae dinna greet, dearie ; but pit on your duds, and lat us thank the Squire and the leddies, and Mr Pratt, and gang awa hame crousely thegither.

There, dearie, that's richt ; wipe your bonnie een, and mak' haste.' Nelly had risen to her feet as he spoke, and done her best to smile upon him through her tears. Her preparations were soon made.

Yet, although she clung to her husband more closely and lovingly as if to show her own unswerving faith in him, and he made light of her father's outburst in good-humoured attempts to set her at ease, an undefined unacknowledged something lay like a drop of lead at the heart of each, as if poured molten from the crucible of Jeremiah's wrath, there to consolidate and lie a heavy load. ' How seldom does the reflection, that every hot and burning word poured forth in anger may scorch and sear a sensitive heart, come to wrathful man or woman in time to stay the voluble torrent, or coming, how seldom is the silent voice regarded,' observed Norman reflectively to Miss Octavia as they threaded their way along intricate passages to the party in the drawing-room. 'Are you speaking from your own ex perience ? ' she asked archly. ' I am speaking from my own observation."], [287, "Hurrah ! 275 I have seen before to-day how the unjustifiable words of an ungovernable tongue could scathe and wither like lightning. I fear your old gardener has planted thorns in the path of the young couple who seemed so happy in each other.' ' If he have, I shall not let him rest until he root them out again,' she replied ; ' but I don't think he has done much real mischief in that quarter, the pair are so utterly devoted to each other, and Ben is so thoroughly good-natured. The words would run from his mind like rain from the back of a water-fowl.' ' Yes, but if the rain were hot and scalding as the speech of John Wesley's over-zealous disciple, it would not run off the water-fowl's back without carrying the feathers with it,' he rejoined. Octavia smiled. ' That is an apt simile, Mr Norman, and you may be right after all. But I am more concerned about the effect of his words on Mr Pratt. They touched him on a very sore point. He has not, to my know ledge, played any dance music for many years, in fact, not since he was appointed parish clerk. And, although he argued in defence of Ben's dancing and his own playing, I fancy it was"], [288, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 276 more for the sake of putting Ben and Nelly at ease, and confounding the vituperative Method ist, than from personal feeling. Trench in sulted him grossly, and as Pratt was here solely to oblige me, I feel the more annoyed. Then I fancy he was more hurt than he would admit, or he would not have argued the point at all, for he is a man of few words. He said it was of no consequence when father and I attempted to apologise ; but I am not so sure of that. And I may have to make peace between him and the Rector.' ' Not a very difficult task, I should think,' said Norman, in a tone that implied it would not be difficult if he were the Rector. 'We \u2014 11, I am not sure about that. It depends on his view of the case. Mr Preston can be very obstinate at times.' Irene and the Squire had been walking a little in advance. The former had stopped short at the open drawing-room door. ' What is that about papa ? ' she asked lightly. ' I am hoping he will not blame Jacob Pratt for his involuntary share in this evening's disquiet' ' Oh, I should hope not ; ' but there was implied doubt in Irene's tone."], [289, "Hurrah ! 277 Norman changed the subject. ' Miss Preston, I perceive you are already equipped for your walk home. My uncle laid upon me a strict injunction to escort you in safety to the Rectory this evening in case you were alone. May I look for the honour?' and he bowed politely. 'That is so like dear godpapa. If I hap pen to be out after dusk, he seems fearful lest some grim wolf should steal out of a wood and snap me up like Red-Riding Hood.' A merry smile rippled over the girl's face and dimpled her cheeks \u2014 revealing a row of pearly teeth between lips of rose-leaf red, as she added, ' I think it absurd. No one about Highfield would harm me. Still, I thank godpapa, and you also, Mr Norman, although \u2014 ' Her speech was stopped abruptly by the announcement, 'The Rector's brougham waits.' ' Oh, in that case, Irene,' put in Mrs Cope land, rising from a lounge near Mrs Stan field, ' you can drive me home without troubling the Squire, and we may also offer Mr Norman a seat, so he may act as cavalier to both of us.' Of course, Norman was 'only too happy.'"], [290, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 278 Whilst the ladies interchanged kisses, Mrs Stanfield shook hands with him most cordi ally, the Squire heartily, Miss Stanfield offered him two limp fingers, but Miss Octavia allowed her hand to linger a moment in his clasp, and the warm touch sent a thrill through every vein and fibre. Down the dark hill they went \u2014 first to leave Mrs Copeland at Moorside House, up again and along shop-lighted Church Street to the Rectory, where Norman left Miss Irene, in fulfilment of his uncle's charge, and much to that uncle's satisfaction \u2014 but, though there was some sort of desultory conversation during the drive, it passed from his mind like breath from a mirror ; there was no room for anything but the image of Octavia Stanfield. ' I've an idea the widow is sweet on Norman Sedgwick,' said the Squire laughingly, when he returned to the drawing-room ; ' I was told she travelled to Colborough in the train which took him back to London, and laid siege to him on the platform, enlisting him in her service vi-et armis. She evidently does not intend to remain a widow over long.' ' Nonsense, Ernest ; Mrs Copeland is old enough to be Norman's mother. Besides, she"], [291, "Hurrah ! 279 is too much wrapped up in her son Clarence to think of marrying again,' said Mrs Stanfield. ' I fancy it looks more like match-making than marrying,' suggested Miss Octavia, with a slight access of colour. Miss Stanfield darted a piercing glance at her sister. ' What induces you to imagine that ? ' she asked loftily. 'Only her readiness to give Irene the escort Mr Sedgwick proposed for her,' answered Octavia, turning away as she spoke. ' Really, your perception has grown too acute of late ; papa's vivid imagination pales before it,' retorted Beatrice, sarcastically, with a curl on her lip which betokened watchfulness as well as penetration. She had heard of Norman Sedgwick before she saw him, and was searching the recesses of her sister's soul. The sister of the future Lady Spencer must not waste a second thought on a man of his class. And she suspected many wasted thoughts. 'Well, time will show whether marrying or match-making,' said the Squire. And, the delayed dinner being served, the adjournment to the dining-room put an end to the colloquy. Sir John Spencer and Squire Stanfield met,"], [292, "280 The Slowly Grinding Mills. as appointed, at Theobald Sedgwick's office the following morning. The lawyer duly in troduced his nephew as his future manager, and both were heartily congratulated by the Squire. Sir John \u2014 a slim, fair-haired man, about thirty, with a much-petted moustache \u2014 accepted the announcement with the polite affability of one whom it only concerned in the way of business ; and no sooner took his seat than he plunged at once into the question of the marriage settlements, whilst Norman made notes, and received instructions, as any other confidential clerk might have done. The Baronet watched the firm hand driving a rapid pen across the paper, with interest concentrated on the provisions of the deeds in preparation, as one by one the items were jotted down ; and, as he watched, a vague thought crossed his mind, that the long, firm hand, with its shapely filbert nails, was that of a gentleman, albeit a lawyer's clerk. But could he have known how that same hand had clasped his future sister-in-law's overnight, he would have started from his seat aghast at the fellow's presumption.

' It is confoundedly irritating to be shut out of their consultation. I looked forward to its chances of revealing something of the colliery affairs. If / had made one there, something would transpire, I'd bet odds. One thing is clear ; Sedgwick is preparing to oust me. It's lucky I sent my letter when I did. But, if the old fellow turns crusty and refuses, where shall I be? It would be ruination to wait until I had my dismissal here. Is that long-legged fellow going to remain here, I wonder ? He only brought a hand-bag.' Such was the tenor of the Bromley rumina tions, disjointed and interrupted by one client or other \u2014 whether to pay money, or to plead for time ; to set the law in motion, or endea vour to stay its course ; to inquire about a case in progress, or to seek temporary advice. Norman Sedgwick was not back in his chambers in three days, and Mr Bromley watched for his departure with increasing"], [294, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 282 anxiety as the hours and days sped. His nervousness on the Saturday morning was palpable. And such was his haste to catch the afternoon train to Colborough that he had to pace the platform fully ten minutes before the train steamed in. His destination was the post-office, but he was desirous to reach it without attracting observation. There was no rain, and no excuse for an open umbrella, but the air was somewhat raw, and, besides wearing a muffler, he turned up the collar of his overcoat. Still one or other met and recognised him, and asked if he had been ill or had a cold. His 'spongy' acquaint ance seemed loth to let him go, but a public-house, a jug of ale, and a pipe rid him of that incumbrance. Moreover, he was not desirous to show up at the post office until the edge of dusk. So fortune favoured him. It might be the effect of agitation, or it might be intentional, but so hoarse and husky was the voice which asked, ' Is there a London letter here for N. B. ? ' it was scarcely recognisable for his. ' It may bear the additional post-mark \" Bow,\" ' he added,"], [295, "Hurrah ! 283 with a strong effort to subdue his nervous tremour. The three minutes during which the clerk lit the gas and searched the letter rack, might have been thirty, measured by his fears and his impatience. His hopes were sinking rapidly when the clerk came back and laid a letter before him, asking if he was the N. B. His fingers trembled as he took it up, answering in the affirma tive, and the post-office clerk noticed that he staggered as he turned from the window. Under a street lamp three yards away he tore it open. A flash of exultation shot into those green-grey eyes of his. ' Hurrah ! there are bank notes inside ! ' That was all he cared to know. Envelope and enclosures went into his inner pocket with a thrust of self-satisfied possession. He had not even looked at the values of the notes. Had there been only one he might have done so. But more assured him of sufficient for his purpose, and he retrod the way to the station as if he trod down fate.
