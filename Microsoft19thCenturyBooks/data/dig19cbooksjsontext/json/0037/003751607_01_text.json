He was a direct lineal descendant of the Treveldoes of Stratton - Porth- Treveldoe, a family well known in the county before the days of King Alfred ; yet Madam Nature, though working with such fine material as this ancient Cornish blood, had produced a man of no particular physical distinction. The long pedigree had, in fact, issued in a short man \u2014 a blunt, bluff, homely sort of man, whom strangers had been known to mistake for a gardener. As a cynical friend (himself the scion of an honest race of butchers) had once remarked : \" The colonel traces his descent almost back to Adam, so it's a clear case of reversion to type \u2014 the gardener-type.\""], [12, "6 Three Brace of Lovers. The history of the Treveldoe race was a long romance, and the colonel himself like a common place tag, added thereto after the author's death by some malignant fellow instinct with the modern democrat's envy and spite. And, as Nature chose to make him a commonplace man, Dame Fortune, with her usual fine sense of harmonious fitness, was careful to leave him a poor one. He began life with but two advantages \u2014 a commission in the army and the fine dogged spirit of his ancestors, which latter unfortunately led him to marry into another im poverished family \u2014 mere mushrooms, too, of whom little or nothing was known before Agincourt. The colonel was now, at the time of our making his acquaintance, about five-and-fifty, and a widower of some years' standing. He was leaning against a table in the reading-room of a West-end club, offering an effective contrast, with his homely figure and rather shabby clothes, to the handsome furni ture around him. He was rattling some halfpence in his trowsers pocket, and pondering deeply, as though trying to solve some abstruse problem \u2014 say, in Rule of Three, which he had mastered after severe study in his cramming days. \" Yes, it will have to be done ; I 've quite made up my mind to it,\" the old soldier muttered to him self, his brow still furrowed by the stress of unwonted mental effort."], [13, "Three Brace of Lovers. 7 \"What will have to be done?\" asked an un expected voice at his shoulder. \" Hullo ! Hugo, what are you doing here ?\" \" Loafing, coz, always loafing ; my existence is summed up in that one word.\" \" What a fool you must be, then ! \" \" Partly that, no doubt, for I don't set up for being better than my neighbours ; but partly also an unfortunate dog.\" \"Psha!\" grunted the colonel, rumpling what little hair Nature had left him, \"you're suffering from a plethora of riches, that 's your only grievance.\" \" That 's one of them, certainly ; a spell of abject poverty would doubtless soothe me inexpressibly, for then I should be too busy bread-earning to have time for reflection on the Irony of Things.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" growled the elder man, more irritably than before. \" No one ever does,\" sighed the other, \" and that's another of my grievances \u2014 I'm a misunder stood man.\" \" Poor devil, I feel for you ! Are you on leave now, Hugo ? \" \" Well, yes; but I've sent in my papers. You'll see my name in the next Gazette.\" \" In the name of Tomfoolery, why ?\" \" I couldn't support the idleness of the Service any longer.\""], [14, "8 Three Brace of Lovers. \" But you 've nothing else to do ? \" \" Nothing whatever, coz, but at least the idle ness will be genuine now ; it was the pretence of work that bored me so. I shall henceforth be a plain, simple, sincere loafer \u2014 and sincerity 's a great luxury, let me tell you.\" \" You go through a campaign with distinction, win the V.C., and a heap of kudos to boot ; and then go and slink out of the Service like any young rip who fails to pay his mess bill. You're nothing short of an idiot, Hugo!\" \"Ah ! that V.C. sticks in my throat, I do assure you. My subaltern, Jones, did far more than I in that action with the Arabs; he's the keenest soldier I know, and the most gallant, and the most hard working\u2014but no one thought of recommending Jones for a V.C. There's the Irony of Fate as usual, you see. I sit on my horse, smoking a cigarette, and get decorated ; Jones plays the hero all day, and never gets even honourable mention. Cousin, the world 's a bubbling caldron of humbug, and I 'm sick of it ! And yet,\" added the melancholy Hugo, with a sigh, \" I was less bored in Egypt than I have been for years ; in fact, the little campaign made mere soldiering in time of peace an anti-climax which has floored me.\" Colonel Treveldoe stood regarding his cousin with a perplexed frown, but could make nothing of"], [15, "Three Brace of Lovers. 9 him. Here was a man half suffocated with the good things of the world, yet sighing like a furnace, pretending even \u2014 save the mark ! \u2014 to the possession of grievances. Hugo's complaints were enough to make a plain man, who had tasted real adversity, swear like a trooper. To see this tall, fashionable lounger, this obvious pet of Fortune, sadly twirling his moustaches as he poured forth his melancholy tale, was a sore trial to a battered old fellow with no sense of humour worth mentioning. \"Well, I suppose you're suffering from the commonest of all ailments \u2014 idleness,\" growled the colonel after a pause, with an effort to sum up his cousin as charitably as possible. The verdict was sound in the main ; but there was, in fact, a screw loose in Hugo's mental, or rather sentimental, constitution which the colonel knew nothing about. The poor fellow was suffering from an ailment more romantic, and far commoner, than that of riches. \" Look here, Chief,\" he said presently, addressing his cousin by an ancient nickname, \" suppose we go and have some lunch ?\" \" I've given up lunching.\" \" Wherefore, coz ? \" \"I'm a pauper,\" retorted the elder man laconi cally, \" and every shilling is a consideration with me \""], [16, "10 Three Brace of Lovers. \" My dear- \" Can't you let a man speak without interruption ? I'm going to give up Society also, and as much of civilisation as is possible.\" \" You 're joking, man ? \" \" The joke's about to land me in a \u00a3ij a year cottage in the country, however,\" said the colonel, grimly. \" Won't you let a useless cousin, who is never any good to anybody, lend you a hand, old fellow ?\" \"No, I won't ; so there's an end of it. I don't want a hand from anyone ; all I want is to be let alone.

I 've taken, or almost taken, a little place, formerly a gamekeeper's lodge, on the banks of the Drowse, and intend to live my own life there. The world will be glad to let a pauper alone, when he confesses his state by living in such a place.

I shall say that I 've secured a little place in the country, and take good care that she never sets eyes on it.\" \"You'll find it difficult to manage that, Chief.\" \" Not at all ; for the girl has always been taught to obey, and not to ask questions.\" \" What will you do all day ? \" Hugo was getting interested in this, to him, highly novel scheme, and drew the colonel into a chair beside him. Before them, as they sat in the great bay-window, streamed all the traffic, glitter and fashion of Piccadilly. \" There 's a decent garden, and I shall grow all my own vegetables, which will occupy a lot of my time. Then there's plenty of coarse fishing in the Drowse, and I shall fish a lot \u2014 for the pot, of course, not for mere amusement. My appetite's good, and perch and pike aren't bad eating.\" \" Hang it ! I like the idea ! \" cried Hugo. \" Your life down there will be quite free, and abso lutely sincere \u2014 what more can a man want ? \""], [18, "Three Brace of Lovers. 12 \" Most men want a good bit more,\" answered the practical old soldier; \" but the constant wear of money-anxiety inclines one to put up with almost anything in order to escape it.\" \" The cottage is some way from any town, really in the country ? \" \"Yes, about two miles from Chatterby, a small place on the Drowse; and it's buried in woods and hop-gardens. For, mind you, I mean business ; no mock gentility for me. I mean to live pretty much as a working-man, at least for a year, till my affairs straighten themselves.\" \" Near Chatterby, you say ?\" \" Yes ; do you know it ? \" Hugo wore at this moment a conscious look which must have evoked the serious curiosity of any woman, but which had no meaning for the solid old \" Chief.\" \" I think I've heard of Chatterby,\" he said care lessly ; \" isn't there a place called Ashlands Court in the neighbourhood ?\" \" I believe so. Ashlands Lock is about a mile or so above my cottage, and there's a big country place on a hill just above it ; probably that's the Court.\" \" Somehow your scheme intoxicates me, cousin.\" \"Then your head must be pretty weak, I should think.

I should like to join you in your cottage, if a companion wouldn't bore you ? \" \" Don't be a fool, my good fellow. What ! a young Society fop like you in a six-roomed cottage ? You don't seem to understand that I 'm simply and actually going to give the go-by to gentility for a spell \u2014 to clean my own boots, cook my own breakfast, and do everything else except the sweeping of the house and washing-up of plates, which an old woman has undertaken to see to for a trifle.\" \" Chief, you've heard of Rasselas ?\" \" No. What regiment was he in ? Hugo looked baffled, and tried another tack \" You may not believe me, but I too wish to be quit of Society and its humdrum round, and enjoy a draught of freedom. I tell you everything here is stale and flat to me, and every new conventional dis traction but a new phase of boredom. Now, your cottage is on the river, you said ? Well, I could keep one or two boats at the bottom of the garden, and live on the water \" \" But I don't want you, my good fellow . It doesn't seem to occur to you that you might be a confounded"], [20, "Three Brace of Lovers. 14 nuisance, if you seriously wished to make such an ass of yourself.\" Now, but for this opposition, it is probable that Hugo's momentary whim would have died a natural death; as it was, he at once became violently enamoured of the scheme. In point of fact, there was a large vein of what his friends were pleased to call \" cussedness \" in his composition ; and, further, there was a certain aroma in the atmosphere of the Chatterby district which had a special attraction for him just now. At any rate, he at once proceeded to vigorously refute all Colonel Treveldoe's objections. The dialogue which ensued between this brace of cousins might have tickled the ears of auy cynical critic of the Superior sex. As everyone else had gone to luncheon, they had a clear field for their argument ; and both waxed warm, not to say angry, in the course of it ; while the naive selfishness of the masuline gender ran through the discussion like a bright thread. Hugo's eloquence all went to show how this hermit-life on the Drowse would suit himself; how he would again take up his neglected violin ; how excellent would be the opportunity for the practice of his last new fad \u2014 instantaneous photography ; and so on. Colonel Treveldoe, gradually worried into acquiescence by his cousin's insistence, and"], [21, "Three Brace of Lovers. 15 thinking perhaps that a single week in the cottage would suffice to sicken him of it for good, at length grudgingly consented to receive him for a short time ; after which point the colloquy proceeded somewhat in this fashion : \" I don't know anything of gardening at present, but shall get a handbook and mug it up, and then \" \" Barges, did you say ? The barge-life will suit the hand-camera to a T ; and look here, coz \" \" I know you dib in potatoes, but what is ' dibbing in,' and when do you do it ? And as for cabbages \" \" I shall give myself out as a photographer, and offer to take picnic-parties and the like at a moderate rate. Couldn't we put up a board to that effect at the bottom of your potato-garden ? \" \" Of course it will be absurd to think of flowers, except perhaps a nasturtium or two, which look bright in the . . . late autumn, or early spring, \u2014 or whenever they do come up. You'll have to get the breakfast, Hugo, as you will come bothering me. In fact, you '11 save my time in one or two ways, for I fully intend to make you work. As you insist so strongly upon making a fool of yourself, you shall take the consequences \" \" Whereabouts is \" \" I wish you'd attend to me, instead of gabbling"], [22, "Three Brace of Lovers. 16 on like this,\" cried the colonel with asperity. \"You talk, talk, talk, and never listen to a word I say ! \" \"Ah! that's the way of us all,\" said Hugo, with a dry chuckle. \"As for your photographic whim, that'll be for gotten by the time you join me; and the fiddling too, I should hope, for I don't want the infernal squeaking of the instrument about the place.\" \" You must allow,\" suggested Hugo, apologeti cally, \" for a man who spent some years at a German University ; it was there that I contracted the musical disease. However,\" he added, cheerfully, \"a few more years of commonplace English life will assuredly cure me.\" \" I should hope so. And now, as I 'm rather busy, you might drive round the shops and pick me up one or two cheap handbooks on gardening ?\" \"Certainly, Chief; I shall study them too, and so win a foretaste of our Arcadian life on the Drowse.\""], [23, "Three Brace of Lovers. 17 CHAPTER II. HE little place called Chatterby, in whose neighbourhood Col. Treveldoe and his cousin were about to commence housekeeping in so picturesquely rustic a fashion, was not one of those drowsy, dead-alive little towns about which we read so much ; but, on the whole, rather a brisk little place, gay at certain periods, downright dissipated at times \u2014 as, for instance, during the Christmas holidays, or the annual cricket week, when a couple of county matches were played on the town ground \u2014 and fervidly athletic always. In this latter respect, indeed, Chatterby was fully abreast of the times, its conversation running steadily in the cricket groove during the summer months, and only veering with the fall of the leaf to the equally important one of football. Its society was always, metaphorically speaking, in flannels; and through the autumn months \"football knees\" and broken collar-bones were such matter-of-course incidents as to be hardly worth talking about. The life of little Chatterby centred mainly in the great school of four hundred and fifty boys, whose cricket was compulsory, whose masters were for the 2"], [24, "18 Three Brace of Lovers. most part old 'Varsity \" Blues,\" and the main current of whose ambition set in the direction of 'Varsity Eights and Elevens. To win a scholarship at either University was no actual discredit to a Chatterby youth ; but were he troubled with a genuine itch for Fame, he knew better than to addle his head with Aristotle or the Differential Calculus. Thus, in this favoured town, an old Indian warrior \u2014 and the place was thick-sown with retired majors and colonels \u2014 could be certain of having his son brought up in healthy English fashion, of launching him into manhood with his character braced by wholesome British prejudice, and his mind impregnated with that contempt for learning which makes us Englishmen what we are. Anything in the way of intellectual priggism was, you may be sure, quite unknown in this cheerful little town. No one spoke ill of you for thinking too highly of Pickwick, or for not thinking enough of Adonais or Sordello ; but, if you didn't know the amount of Tomson's score last match, or John son's bowling average up to date, why the women thought you a poor creature, and the men called you one. But, despite some little weaknesses, the Chatterbians were a kindly and hospitable people, and not so very conceited \u2014 considering their merits. Down tbe main street of this athletic hotbed"], [25, "Three Brace of Lovers. 19 there chanced to be walking, one June day, soon after the meeting of Col. Treveldoe and his cousin, a young fellow of four or five-and-twenty, named Bissett Pyne. He was flannel-clad, as a matter of course, for to walk through Chatterby on a summer afternoon in any other costume would have been to wantonly outrage public opinion ; and his mauve and-white \" blazer \" proclaimed him a member of the boating club connected with a certain military tutor's establishment at Winkleigh, some two miles up the river. Bissett Pyne was a dark, handsome, well-groomed man \u2014 but poor ; well-born, sensitive, and highly cultured \u2014 but poor ; inordinately proud \u2014 but very poor. A shrewd observer, accustomed to read a man's history and character from his carriage and facial expression, would probably have jotted down Pyne's leading points somewhat in the above order, recurring insistently to the poverty. For to the practised eye the handwriting of that common oppressor is a very readable one. Into the face of a man who has to give much thought to the sordid question of income there comes, even at four-and twenty, an unmistakable shadow, to which, more over, Pride is apt to add a firm, sharp outline. Ill-health itself can hardly write a clearer hand than can Genteel Poverty. As he passed down the High Street, young men 2 *"], [26, "Three Brace of Lovers. 20 stopped Bissett Pyne to ask, with the aggressive manner of the Englishman who suspects you of not sharing his pet prejudice, why he was not going to the tennis club ; flocks of schoolboys hurried past him on their way to the cricket ground ; a picnic party, bound for the boathouse, caught him up, and tried to absorb him \u2014 but Bissett was not to be enticed from the path of duty, which, as it happened, led straight forward to the railway station. Nor would he tell anyone upon what errand he was bound ; for, perhaps, as a self-willed young fellow, he took a pleasure in thus flouting public senti ment by turning his back upon all things proper to a half-holiday. This young tutor \u2014 for he earned his bread in that capacity, and found it the bread of affliction \u2014 was, in truth, bound upon a peculiar, almost deli cate, mission, yet one which, on the face of it, should have been a pleasant one ; for he was about to receive, and take charge of, a youthful cousin, understood to be beautiful as well as young, whose full style and title he was conning as he marched over the town bridge. \"The Honourable Delicia Muriel Beatrice Forbes Fitzalan de Ribeau,\" he muttered scathingly, halting for a moment to lean upon the bridge-parapet and wish himself in a sculling-boat. \"And I've no doubt she's as insolent, fashionable,"], [27, "Three Brace of Lovers. 21 feather-headed a young minx as ever cut a poor gentleman ! All women are snobs at heart,\" he added, with the trenchant injustice natural to youth, pride, and temper, in combination, \" and I know she'll make life a burden to us at home!\" A few words will suffice to explain the situa tion which this high-stomached young tutor found so galling. Bissett's father, the Rev. Edmund Pyne, was sprung from an old Stubbleshire stock, and for many years held a family living in that county. Though he had never been a rich man, or a good manager of what small private means he possessed, the living was a good one ; and his brother, Sir Bissett, was so truly brotherly as always to be a friend in need, available for any emergency. Thus the Pynes had always been able to live a comfort able, easy-going, country life enough ; and their son had gone from a public school to Oxford, as a matter of course. Bissett, moreover, was a clever, energetic lad, with every intention of carving out a career for himself; but, unfortunately, just as he had secured a first-class in Moderations, and was marching for ward, chisel in hand, with good hope of continuing the carving process, his father died suddenly. As everyone expected, Mr. Pyne's provision for his widow and son was found to be of a slight"], [28, "Three Brace of Lovers. 22 and feeble description. He had proposed to live on, at least, until Bissett should have made his start in the world, and was much astonished and confounded to find himself upon his death-bed. But even his brother, the baronet, the good-natured prop and mainstay in all difficulty, could not ward off this grim visitor. Mr. Pyne had to die, as better and worse men have done, with a suddenness quite outside his calculations. At this juncture Sir Bissett came to the fore, as usual, at once offering to help his nephew at Oxford, and to give the lad's mother a home for as long as she chose to keep it. But young Bissett's pet weak ness, with which the reader is already acquainted, was a complete bar to this reasonable plan. He could not see his way to being dependent upon his uncle for an indefinite period ; and, with all the courage of youth, ignorance, and obstinacy, decided to confront the world unbacked by anyone. It cost him a severe pang to give up his University career, but in the first flush of independence he performed the feat, and thereupon flung himself upon the tutorial market. Result, so far, a classical tutorship at the Rev. Hugh Mulliner's\u2014 and the Chatterby Villa ; future prospects, indefinite tutoring\u2014 and still the villa. When the mother and son settled into the new groove, however, they found a good many more"], [29, "Three Brace of Lovers. 23 friends than they had hoped for ; and one of the two was fairly content. Had she not her son for half of every Saturday and all Sunday, her old maid Hester \u2014 converted now into a general servant, \u2014 a small front garden full of flowers, and a large district full of quarrelsome poor people to be visited ? A mother of the right sort, with a son who makes no threat of going to India or settling in the backwoods, can surrender material comforts more easily than most people. Whether or not Bissett learned to regret his folly, was his own secret ; in the main, he took his luck with stoical silence, and waxed bitter accordingly. Now, it fell upon a day, when they had been settled at Chatterby for some three years, that Mrs. Pyne was officially informed that her nephew, Lord Hengist, was about to be married. This nephew had forgotten her existence for some years, but circumstances connected with his own interest had now refreshed his lordship's memory. He and his sister Delicia were orphans, and had, unfortunately, inherited the contentious spirit for which the de Ribeau family was famous. Down at the old place in Hampshire they would quarrel together at their ease, and did so pretty frequently, without much hurt to anyone ; but, through finding this monotonous, or from sheer ill-luck, they con trived one day \u2014 just when Lord Hengist had landed"], [30, "Three Brace of Lovers. 24 an heiress, too, and should have been as amiable as the day was long \u2014 to have a serious difference of opinion with Mrs. Longhurst, a fashionable aunt, by whom Delicia had been brought up. To do Miss de Ribeau justice, it must be admitted that most of the quarrels \u2014 and this one in particular \u2014 were owing to her brother rather than herself; but the fact remained that Mrs. Longhurst was irrevocably offended, and none of her other relatives seemed inclined to give her a home. The heiress, whose first business would be to pay Lord Hengist's debts, had no fancy for having a sister-in-law to manage as as well as a husband ; it was therefore pressingly needful for Delicia to look out for a home. She was but a girl \u2014 not eighteen until next autumn \u2014 and whither was she to turn? She puzzled her head over the question for some time, and Lord Hengist swore heartily over it to his friends, but no solution of the problem offered itself. At length his lordship remembered the existence of his mother's sister, Mrs. Pyne, who was understood to be living in obscurity in some country town or other. But Dehcia put her foot down, vowing not to surrender herself to the care of poor relations in any part of the country ; whereupon her brother put his foot down, and swore there was nothing else to be done. He informed her at the same time, moreover, that she had but \u00a3&o a year of her own, and that he was"], [31, "Three Brace of Lovers. 25 himself too much embarrassed to make her an allowance. He would arrange, however, that she should not be a burden upon her aunt, and her own \u00a380 must find her in dress and pocket-money. Delicia complained, resisted, and wept in vain. The wedding-day drew on, and no other outlet from the situation was discoverable. A paltry country town, with its paltry and vulgar society \u2014 such as she was well acquainted with through the medium of lady novelists \u2014 was to be her doom ; she must needs face it with what patience she possessed, which was of poor texture. Her executioner, as she had now begun to consider her brother, made all arrangements for the sacrifice, and cousin Bissett was now, as we have seen, actually on his way to meet the victim. Bissett was carrying out his task with a sense of deep resentment against Fate, chiefly, as he put it to himself, on his mother's account. Certainly it was a grievous thing for Mrs. Pyne to have this fashionable, and probably frivolous, young relative thrust into her quiet home-life, and she had accepted the unpleasant duty with many sighs ; but Bissett's resentment was not all in her interest, his darling pride was tingling on his own account. He could bear to be poor in private, or, at any rate, could show a bold front to the world while gnawing out his heart in secret ; but to have a perfect stranger,"], [32, "26 Three Brace of Lovers. a member of the regardful sex whose eyes nothing escapes, a person accustomed to rich ways and rich people, a girl doubtless imbued with that contempt for poverty which he looked upon as woman's leading characteristic, planted in that tiny villa, among all its little shifts and economies, was almost more than youthful flesh and blood could support. He writhed under the infliction, and groaned under the weight of his poverty as he had never groaned before. The distance between the town bridge and the railway station was barely a quarter of a mile, but in that short space Bissett worked through his grievance from end to end and from side to side, and finished by striding on to the platform in a state of hopeless exasperation. The practice of self-pity is indeed one very wearing to the nervous system ; so much so, that, just when he wished to be perfectly cool and superior, he found himself growing as shy as a girl, which increased his irrita tion tenfold. A simple-hearted, less egoistic man might have faced the seventeen-year-old cousin with out a qualm ; but the train was nearly due, and Bissett could not hope to change his nature at five minutes' notice. He was confident that Miss de Ribeau would patronise him with her first glance, rasp his sore pride with her opening sentence ; and the more he dwelt upon this the more bitter he grew. With"], [33, "Three Brace of Lovers. 27 some vague notion of propping up his dignity, he bought a Punch at the bookstall, then threw it aside with a scoff at his own weakness \u2014 he would play the part of cool, nonchalant stranger without the assistance of any stage-properties whatever. Unfortunately, he felt not cool, but annoyingly nervous \u2014 almost frightened, as he confessed with an angry flush. Had not stern Pride forbidden such a bathos, he would have been glad to indulge in a whisky-and-soda at the refreshment bar ; as it was, nature at length became too strong for him, he sacrificed self-respect so far as to light a cigarette. This comforted him for a moment or two, when he positively picked up his Punch again. He was, in fact, throwing away dignity in bits, as a balloonist casts out sand-bags, but still failed to rise from the earth. The train was late ; the exasperating clock appeared to stand still. Had the delay continued much longer, he must have descended even to the whisky-and-soda. Meanwhile, the Hon. Delicia Muriel Beatrice, etc., was speeding towards him in a first-class carriage, and in a condition hardly more enviable than his own. Upon saying farewell to her maid on the London platform she had, as it were, cast off the last rope that bound her to civilisation ; good bye now to society and refinement, to balls, theatres, pretty dresses, and everything else that makes for"], [34, "28 Three Brace of Lovers. human happiness. She was now an exile from the pleasant meads of Fashion, condemned to end her days in the desert of a petty country town, with the ministration of poor relations to aggravate her hard lot. Of course they would welcome her, and be proud to parade a person of social importance like herself among the lawyers and doctors of their acquaintance. And she meant to be as generally civil as she could, provided people kept their dis tance. She meant to be a genuine novel-heroine \u2014 proud, beautiful, composed \u2014 moving among these inferiors with an air of sad distinction, unapproach able, yet benign ; regal, yet superbly gracious. Doubtless Aunt Sybil would be eagerly awaiting her upon the platform \u2014 a plain, homely creature, dressed like a housekeeper, and carrying a bag of parcels\u2014 and would greet her with little gush of mild platitudes, and some kissing ? And late in the afternoon the shabby tutor would come home to tea, and \u2014 perhaps he too, as a man and a cousin, w-ould wish to take a hand in the kissing ? But no, she need not fear that, the humble fellow would scarcely dare even to raise his eyes to hers ; rather would he sit wondering at her style and beauty, timidly offering her bread-and-butter now and then, or venturing a question or two as to the sights of London. After wards . . . but DOOT Delicia rnnlrl nmr-opH r,^ but poor Delicia could proceed no further with her miserable programme ; imagination"], [35, "Three Brace of Lovers. 29 having done its worst, she was fain to shed a few quiet tears in the corner of the carriage, to the horror of a soft-hearted old gentleman who sat blinking opposite. The cry of \" Chatterby \u2014 change here for Talk town and Dulbury ! \" sounded like a knell in her ears. No smart maid would come to the window now to assist her, no deferential man-servant would approach to take charge of everything ; there would be no Aunt Longhurst awaiting her in the neat Victoria, but only the housekeeper \u2014 and the kissing. Delicia stepped out upon the platform, heart-sick and forlorn, waiting to be sacrificed. But no one seemed to be expecting her. True, an elderly woman, corresponding closely to the housekeeper-portrait, did bear down upon her in a flurried condition ; but, in place of any words of welcome, cried : \" 'Ere, miss, am I right for Dulbury, do you think ?\" Then a civil porter approached from the rear of the train, saying : \" Any of this here your luggage, miss ?\" All of it was Delicia's, and there seemed to be enough to fill Woodbine Villa from garret to base ment. A haughty-looking gentleman, with straight features and a dark complexion, and a bearing suggestive of five thousand a year, was regarding it critically."], [36, "Delicia stepped out upon the plats"], [37, "Three Brace of Lovers. 31 \" Evidently a somebody !\" thought Delicia. \" I almost wish he would speak, since he's the last civilised person with whom I am likely to exchange a word.\" The young baronet, or duke, or whatever he might be, seemed to have heard her unspoken thought, for he came forward, raising his flannel cap and saying : \" Miss de Ribeau, I believe ?\" Delicia felt bewildered. Had her brother de puted some friend to meet her, just to break her fall on arrival ? How very kind of Hengist \u2014 and how very unlike him ! She found herself at once taken possession of, escorted down the platform, and handed into a fly, about a quarter of her luggage being stacked with difficulty upon the box-seat and outworks. The stranger seated himself beside her; the flyman at once drove off, apparently needing no directions. \" Are you going to deliver me at Mr. Pyne's, may I ask?\" \" Exactly so. I 'm your cousin, Bissett.\" \"What! the tu ?\" The half word articulated itself before she could check her tongue. \" Yes\u2014 the tutor.\" As Bissett pronounced the word a dark flush crept up his cheek."], [38, "Three Brace of Lovers. 32 \" She has begun well,\" thought he. Delicia leaned back, limp with amazement. There need have been nothing phenomenal in the discovery that her cousin was as distinguished looking and superior as herself \u2014 as she could not help acknowledging at this moment \u2014 but she was completely taken aback. He should, as we know, have been a timid, shabby, overworked creature, almost afraid to open his lips, gratefully accepting her patronage ; and this mental picture of him had been worked up so elaborately, conned so frequently, that its sudden collapse was bewildering. Bissett, on his side, had also to re-adjust a care fully considered preconception. He found his cousin objectionable \u2014 so far, no fresh arrangement of ideas was necessary ; but her appearance surprised him. He had imagined her tall, pale, and haughty ; and she proved to be small, and as dark of hue as himself. She was a brunette, richly tinted ; her face a pointed oval ; her eyes full of life and fire, and shaded by lashes the longest he had ever seen : her general expression he considered insolent. Her beauty, however, claimed a good deal of attention as they drove up the High Street, so that Bissett's resentment against her was veined with reluctant pride. They passed, as it happened, most of the shabbiest and homeliest people of his acquaintance, and it must be admitted that Bissett"], [39, "Three Brace os Lovers. 33 would have preferred at this juncture to exchange bows with some of the smarter sort ; yet he scrupulously acknowledged every greeting, whereas Miss de Ribeau would, in his place, most probably have checked one or two by judicious use of her parasol. As they rumbled over the town bridge she uttered an exclamation : \" Is this the Drowse ? \u2014 what a dirty river, to be sure ! And they are actually boating on this soupy water, I see \u2014 truly the good people here must be hard up for amusement ! There's a fine old ruined wall on the farther bank, however, and surely I see the keep of an old castle through the trees ? \" \" Yes, it is an old Anglo-Norman castle, which sustained a memorable siege by Simon de Montfort, and there's a modern residence built on to it.\" \" I suppose it is occupied by some county family now ?\" \" I regret to say it is at present a seminary for young ladies.\" \" Oh !\" she exclaimed, with a little shudder. After the bridge the High Street widens a little, and a few decent shops make their appearance. In front of these some carriages were drawn up, making a little simmer of traffic and bustle ; and further on they passed an old Elizabethan inn, before which the advanced guard of a homely circus company was 3"], [40, "Further on they passed an old Eliz:abctlian inn."], [41, "Three Brace of Lovers. 35 defiling, with a score of small boys at its heels. In fact, the livelier aspect of things seem to cheer Delicia in some degree, thus bringing a more gracious expression into her face. Pressing forward at a kind of lolloping trot, the old fly-horse presently drew them clear of the street, and abreast of the old school, with its mellow grey walls and quadrangle daintily turfed. This evoked from the visitor her first expression of real pleasure. \" My old school,\" Bissett explained, with sup pressed pride, \" founded in Edward the Sixth's reign \u2014 built in Queen Anne's. I used to be at the School-House \u2014 that's it on the left as you go in.\" The cold-mannered cousin spoke quite heartily this time ; his face brightened as well as Delicia's. Soon afterwards, too, they came upon something else worth looking at \u2014 the school cricket-ground, at the open gate of which the flyman, as a Chatterbian who respected himself and his fare, of course drew up for a moment or two. Immediately before them was a crowd of cream-white figures, flitting about like clots of wind-driven foam upon a sea of emerald. \" But this is only a game,\" Bissett explained ; \" there's a match going on down below, on the Head Eleven ground. Hark! there's a cheer.\" \"Very good eleven this year, sir?\" suggested the flyman eagerly. \" Muster Crashling was the 3 *"], [42, "36 Three Brace of Lovers. best public-school bat last year, and they say he '11 captain the Hoxford Eleven next. D'ye think he will, sir ? 'cos there 's some bettin' goin' on about it, and I've a mind to put half-a-crown on Crashling.\" \" He'll play for Oxford next year, and captain the 'Varsity Eleven the year after,\" said Bissett with decision. The driver was standing up amidst the hecatomb of luggage, gazing yearningly down the avenue of chestnuts towards the lower ground; and Bissett was equally loath to proceed homewards, as dreading the coming anti-climax, which was now so close at hand; for they had to drive but a short distance \u2014 past half-a dozen big houses and gardens and a small church of notable ugliness \u2014 and then \u2014 the \" Twopenny Villa,\" as Bissett, already in the throes ofthe coming mortifi cation, was minded to call it. Reluctantly he gave the word to drive on, and in three minutes' time they were passing the crude iittle red-brick church. At this point they turned off the respectable main road, down a short lane which seemed to lead straight into the heart of the country, and almost immediately the lane ended in a field full of browsing cows. All around them were meadows and hop-gardens, interspersed with ash-plantations. On their left stood a small \u2014 a very small \u2014 house, cut off from the lane by a narrow strip of front garden."], [43, "Three Brace of Lovers. 37 \" Why, surely we have taken a wrong turning ?\" cried Delicia. \" This must be a gardener's house ? \" \"No,\" said Bissett quietly, \"it's not good enough for a successful gardener ; it is a tutor's house, and his mother lives there with him \u2014 I am sorry they have no better place in which to welcome you.\" Poor Delicia fell back against the hard cushion of the fly with a dazed look in her eyes, more thoroughly depressed and wretched even than she had been during that gloomy journey from London."], [44, "38 Three Brace of Lovers. CHAPTER III. PYNE installed his cousin in the tiny cottage drawing-room with ____/^_.___^-V, ./ o o $\u00a3?*?.\u25a0&) more gentleness of manner than he \"^^JC? had yet exhibited ; he sympathised with her depression at this moment, when the utter insignificance of the new environ ment so dazed and bewildered her. Nor would he forget for a long time to come what a pang it had cost him to bring his mother from the comfortable and spacious old vicarage home, with its bosky garden, which seemed to have gathered into itself the peace and repose of a hundred quiet years, to this paltry villa, with its little patch of flowers in front, balanced by its strip of cabbages behind. For the first few days, he remembered, the tiny rooms and crude surroundings had crushed all the spirit out of them. In fact, though he would have respected his cousin more had she showed her disappointment less, he was just enough to admit that her case was a hard one. He knew exactly what would occur now. His mother, who by the divine right of kind feeling understood most human troubles, great and small, had seen the arrival from her bedroom window, but"], [45, "Three Brace of Lovers. 39 had not as yet appeared to welcome her niece, which meant that the stranger would be given a little time in which to compose herself. Old Hester would take charge of the new-comer, who, the moment she came downstairs after changing her dress, would be physicked with a glass of Tarragona. Later on, Delicia would doubtless be despatched upstairs again to try that feminine recipe for all the ills that flesh is heir to \u2014 an hour's lying down. Meanwhile Bissett proceeded to help the per spiring flyman with the luggage. They toiled manfully at the portentous heap, but as the tiny house flatly refused to receive the bigger boxes, the latter had to be stacked in Bissett's \"workshop,\" as he called it \u2014 a corrugated iron shed at the bottom of the cabbage-garden. Bissett would not see his mother, for fear of pouring out his unfavourable impression of the new-comer ; but, after dismissing the driver, with some further hints as to Crashling's prospects of a great career, retired to his workshop with a view to seeking the consolation of strong tobacco. For a time silence reigned in the cottage, save for the songs of many skylarks and other country sounds that floated in at the open windows ; then a rustle on the narrow stair and a gentle cough in the hall announced that Aunt Sybil was about to face the invader of her peace."], [46, "Three Brace of Lovers. 40 She opened the door noiselessly, and found Delicia weeping copiously upon the sofa, just as she had expected. The glass of Tarragona had been quite ineffectual so far. Mrs. Pyne was naturally shy and self-distrustful, but the least symptom of distress in another always had the effect of dissolving this weakness. She now advanced without hesitation, took one of her niece's small hands, and sat down beside her, murmuring \"Poor child!\" Not another word was spoken for the present. Delicia looked up, and the imaginary housekeeper evaporated even as the shabby tutor had done ; this time, however, without causing her any surprise, for she was too deeply crushed to be capable of an emotion so lively. Yet there was something soothing about the consciousness that kind grey eyes were bending over her, and a gentle face with a certain haunting peace about it, like the brooding of summer twilight. Indeed, human kindness, if large and deep enough thus to etherealise the face of its possessor, is not to be resisted by ordinary flesh and blood, and Delicia presently felt an inclination to pour out her heart a little and be comforted. She tried to raise herself, but being a good deal over come, sank back with a fresh gush of tears \u2014 only this time somehow her head sank upon the shoulder that seemed to be awaiting it."], [47, "Her head sank upon the shoulder that seemed to be awaiting it."], [48, "Three Brace of Lovers. 42 \"Why, what a pretty child it is!\" murmured Aunt Sybil, almost involuntarily ; and that one sentence was a little conquest in itself. For if the lords of creation, with all their large philosophy and perfect freedom from any taint of vanity, occasionally lend a good-natured ear to \" the tinsel clink of compliment,\" what can be expected of the weaker vessel ? Had Mrs. Pyne been the veritable housekeeper painted by her niece's morbid imagination, instead of the dainty and refined little woman she was in reality, this piece of flattery must have softened Delicia. In a short space of time she was so far com posed as to be equal to drinking a cup of tea, and Hester was accordingly summoned. Happily, Delicia was not addicted to inspecting herself through the eyes of other people \u2014 at any rate, those of domestic servants \u2014 or Hester's swift, critical glance as she entered the room might have troubled her ; nor had she the least conception of how much the peace of a small household depends upon the goodwill of its servants, and the preserva tion of the kitchen's nervous equilibrium. She would have been amazed to learn that the first intimation of her coming entry into the family had convulsed this little world to its centre ; that faithful Hester, whose happiness consisted in slaving for those she loved, whose jealous temper would not"], [49, "Three Brace of Lovers. 43 even brook the presence of another servant as a sharer of her beloved mistress's favour, had, when informed of the expected invasion, reached the dramatic climax of her life, and given that mistress notice. This outrage had Hester perpetrated in the first flush of her indignation, and her subsequent remorse had been more tragic than the deed itself. Delicia was aware that a servant of very decent demeanour had entered the room and left it, but that was all ; she only hoped the other domestics might be of a like respectable stamp. However, she did notice that the silver teapot was charmingly antique, and the tea-set of the daintiest Crown Derby. The furniture of the room, too, had evidently come from the old home, and there were one or two good water-colours upon the walls ; not that Delicia could appreciate the latter, her artistic perceptions being at present held in check by a leaning towards the \" sweetly pretty.\" But she could take pleasure in the view from the single window, which embraced a breadth of placid country, in no wise fine, yet suave and soothing. True, there wasa banal foreground of cabbage-garden, chastely environing Bissett's corrugated-iron shed; but, by keeping well back from the window, the garden became invisible, and the shed ceased to obtrude itself. On the whole, the new surroundings"], [50, "Three Brace of Lovers. 44 improved on closer acquaintance \u2014 and Aunt Sybil evidently thought her charming. This assumption was a delicate tribute to Aunt Sybil's kindness, for in truth Mrs. Pyne had some difficulty in being as favourably impressed by her niece as she wished and intended. She was genuinely anxious to be in place of a mother to Delicia and to grow really fond of her, but felt rather chilled than encouraged when her niece began to talk freely. Not that Mrs. Pyne was inclined to judge as harshly as her son, but there were little notes which jarred upon a sensitive ear ; indeed, it was hardly possible for the visitor to throw off at a moment's notice a role that she had been studying for weeks. Frequent rehearsals had thoroughly impressed her with the part ; some of the lines suitable to a heroine from another sphere came to her lips of their own accord. Mrs. Longhurst, the aunt who, with the assist ance of a succession of governesses, had been so good as to \" form \" Delicia, was a woman of fashion, but, save in that important respect, not one especially well adapted for the training of a young mind. Her system, perhaps, resembled too much that of a gardener who concentrates his efforts upon the pro duction of showy blossom at the expense of a plant's vital power. Delicia was certainly a showy blossom, who, but for that untoward quarrel with her trainer, would have been on view this London season ; yet"], [51, "Three Brace of Lovers. 45 her talk might have provoked, even in a woman of less insight than this other aunt, thoughts of the pruning-knife. She had plenty to say for herself, now that she was quite at her ease ; there was no difficulty in entertaining her. Aunt Sybil quickly abandoned her intention of sending the child up stairs for an hour's lying-down; as a niece who was already sufficiently at ease to patronise her might be spared any composing treatment of that sort. Bissett did not come in for his usual cup of tea, a sign that his prescience had not been at fault, that he found the new cousin as little to his taste as he had expected. Mrs. Pyne sighed furtively; it was a bad beginning. Were Bissett's prejudices to become intensified, she might lose a good deal of his society, thanks to the new-comer. Yet, on the whole, she was glad he was absent just now; when Delicia's first excitement should have calmed down, she might become more likeable, and so less impeachable by a critic of four-and-twenty. Mrs. Pyne was a good listener, and had a favourable opportunity of prac tising that virtue during the half-hour which fol lowed upon the removal of the tea equipage ; but she felt a sense of respite when her niece, who had talked a good deal of music and the various masters under whom she had studied, offered to go to the piano and sing something."], [52, "46 Three Brace of Lovers. As his cousin sat down to the instrument Bissett slipped into the room. He approached at once with a view to turning her leaves, but she waved him away hastily. Perhaps Delicia rather prided herself upon her singing, and wished to have them both at as great a distance as the tiny room would permit, in order to get the full benefit of her voice. After looking through her aunt's music she had opened Salaman's \" I Arise from Dreams of Thee,\" and from her handling of the opening chords it was clear that she had been well taught. Her voice, too, was of good quality, but alas ! it soon became apparent that her ear was deficient. She was some times downright flat ; from beginning to end of the song, her voice was never absolutely true. Mrs. Pyne was very musical ; her son, though not a performer, had a faultless ear. The song was nothing short of torture to them both. They listened to it with steadfast and stoical politeness, not daring even to exchange a glance, and murmured conven tional thanks when the trouble was over. \"Your piano's a little out of tune, Aunt Sybil, but shall I sing another while I'm here ?\" Bissett gazed stonily at a sketch of the old home hung upon the wall opposite him, and registered a vow not to come home next Saturday. After a second and a third performance, which"], [53, "Three Brace of Lovers. 47 strained Bissett's politeness almost to the cracking point, she turned to him conversationally, saying : \"Aunt Sybil calls that iron place your'work shop,' is that where you look over the little boys' exercises at the end of the week ?\" \" Precisely ; I have been engaged in something of the sort since your arrival.\" \"And is a tutor's life a very trying one?\" \" There are points about it which might jar upon a man with five thousand a year.\" \" Do you have to take the little boys to church on Sunday, for instance?\" \" Well, only a few of them go to church,\" Bissett answered, with perfect gravity. \"There seems to be a vein of Agnosticism running through the school just now.\" \"Agnosticism? Oh yes, I know about that! Aunt Theodora was an Agnostic last year \u2014 no, it was the- year before, though ; last year I think she was a Pos \u2014 Pos \u2014 something ? \" \"A Positivist?\" \" Yes, that 's it. Her views change, for she always likes to be in the fashion, you know.\" \" I see. In that case her religion must be an interesting sort of miscellany. Has she tried Esoteric Buddhism at all ? \" Poor Mrs. Pyne listened to this dialogue with a pale little smile. She had rather counted upon her"], [54, "48 Three Brace of Lovers. niece's assistance with her Sunday-school class, and now. . . But it was characteristic of the little woman that she felt more drawn towards her niece at this moment than she had yet been. \" Did your aunt never go to church ?\" she asked gently. \" Oh yes, twice a month regularly ; for many of our friends are that way of thinking, and she always thought it bad form to offend people's prejudices. My last governess always insisted upon taking me to church, but she only stayed a month. The fact is,\" Delicia added naively, \" she didn't appreciate my singing \u2014 and so I was angry with her.\" Bissett was conscious of a deep thrill of sympathy for that governess. \"As for my own views,\" continued his cousin, \"they're rather \" \" Rather mixed ?\" suggested Bissett \" Yes, I may say mixed.\" Mrs. Pyne directed a very pitiful mother-look at her niece, and again felt a drawing towards her. Delicia, quite unconscious of this special attraction, turned again to the question of Bissett's professional experiences. \"Do you have to cane the boys much?\" she asked, with a pretty bend of her head towards her cousin. \" Is your school anything like that one in Dickens which Squeers kept ?\""], [55, "Three Brace of Lovers. 49 Fora moment the comparison between Dotheboys Hall and the highly aristocratic establishment of the Rev. Hugh Mulliner made Bissett almost hysterical ; but he answered with tolerable gravity : \" I never cane a pupil, for fear that should lead to a pugilistic encounter.\" \"Are the little fellows so pugnacious, then ?\" \" My dear,\" put in Mrs. Pyne with a smile, \"you mustn't heed Bissett's nonsense ; the ' little fellows ' you speak of are young men, varying from seventeen to twenty-two, reading for the Army and University Examinations.\" \" Oh ! it's a military crammer's, then ?\" \" Just so ; I'm an usher at a crammer's, and they allow me out on Saturdays and Sundays ; at least, they have done so hitherto,\" Bissett added hastily, \"though in future I fancy there'll be some difficulty in getting away.\" \"Ah ! I feared something of the sort !\" mused Bissett's mother, adding aloud\u2014 for she thought the dialogue was growing a little dangerous \u2014 that it was time to see about unpacking some of Delicia's things. \" But won't your maid do that, Aunt Sybil ?\" \" My dear child, I keep but one servant, and she is at this moment cooking the dinner.\" The visitor was too much amazed for any com ment upon this announcement, but followed her aunt upstairs without a word. 4"], [56, "Three Brace of Lovers. 50 The little party reassembled again in about an hour's time, Delicia being this time attired in a ravishing dinner-gown of white and gold. Bissett also was in evening-dress, donned for the sake of pride, or mockery, or grim humour \u2014 he scarcely knew which. Mrs. Pyne's costume betrayed her s#t's nice sense of harmonious fitness ; it was black and sheeny, with an overspread of laciness, and in some inexplicable way seemed to suit the small room and the general atmosphere of the cottage. This daintily equipped group then adjourned to a dining-room hardly bigger than a dolls' house, and sat down to a half-shoulder of mutton, very nicely cooked by old Hester ; who, having done with the kitchen for the present, appeared in a white cap and apron, and waited upon them with all due solemnity. Mrs. Pyne looked tolerably placid and serene, and glanced now and then at her resplendent niece with a kindness veined with something like pity ; Bissett's mood, on the contrary, was far from amiable. During the meal he led his cousin on to prattle fashionable twaddle and expose all her little weaknesses by way of whetstone to his irony. His mother was distressed for her niece, yet need not have been so, for Delicia quite thought she was making a brilliant impression upon them both. Certainly Bissett seemed a little cold and sarcastic, but asked so many questions and listened so politely"], [57, "Three Brace of Lovers. 51 to her dissertations that she felt all the pleased complaisance of an instructress. To the after-dinner hour Mrs. Pyne looked for ward with some apprehension, for as the time went by Bissett grew more politely sarcastic ; but happily a digression occurred almost as soon as the meal was concluded. A visitor, in the shape of Mrs. Pyne's old friend, Major Clinton, was announced and duly ushered in by old Hester, who had to leave her washing-up for the purpose. Major Clinton was acquainted with Delicia's brother, having served in a Fusilier regiment with him in the days when Lord Hengist was but a younger son with no particular prospects, and Mrs. Pyne counted upon this old friend as a useful ally in the entertainment of her niece. For what better purveyor of amusement could have been found within a radius of five miles ? The major was the most popular man about the place, as well as the chief promoter of its institutions. Had he not won the praise of all and sundry by getting up the Club \u2014 the Chatterby Club which had proved such a boon to all the idle old soldiers, sailors, and parsons, with whom little Chatterby always brimmed over ? He was called, indeed, \" the lazy major,\" yet on all sides was accepted as a public benefactor, since his occasional bursts of energy 4 *"], [58, "Three Brace of Lovers. 52 always tended in the direction of the public weal. For instance, when the excitement of organising the Club was over, and he had grown tired of driving his roan cob into the town every morning and home again every afternoon, the major soon became big with another public-spirited scheme, and, working himself up to a fresh operative climax, founded the Chatterby Tennis Club. Whereupon gratitude poured in upon him from all sides ; and another old soldier, with even less to do than our major, got up a testimonial, presenting it to this general benefactor before the assembled Club, together with a eulogistic speech that touched all hearts. In short, the generous warmth which characterised all the speeches delivered at this meeting showed how full of senti mental stuff was this Arcadian little town of Chatterby. The \" lazy major,\" as he was still called \u2014 for custom is even stronger than gratitude, \u2014 had a pleasingly characteristic way of strolling half-way into a sentence, and then compressing the remainder into a simple \" wha'. . . . ?\" or \" d'ye-see ?\" Thus, upon shaking hands with Miss de Ribeau and sinking on to a sofa at her side, he began : \"Well, how are you, Miss de Ribeau? Come down to live with us here in the jungle, with all the wha' . . .?\" He had a complexion of parchment, as became"], [59, "Three Brace of Lovers. 53 an old Indian : humorous grey eyes, in which a laugh seemed to have got entangled in his youth, and to have remained ever since, and a thatch of wavy iron-grey hair above them. Delicia \"took to\" him, as the homely phrase has it, at once. \"She'll find us all very Acardian and that sort of . . . eh, Mrs. Pyne ? But we must get up a little tomasha for her now and then, picnics, and . . . wha' . . .?\" They laughed, as people were wont to do at the genial major's half-embodied thoughts. Bissett forgot to sneer for fully ten minutes after his arrival. This good-natured old bachelor had an eye for a pretty woman, and thought the task of catering for Delicia's amusement might relieve his normal state of boredom very pleasantly ; in fact, as she responded gracefully enough to his suggestions, one of his bursts of energy became imminent. He decreed that Miss de Ribeau must come to the Tennis Club every Wednesday, to the School cricket-matches on Saturdays, to the County match next week, to some river-picnics which he proposed to organise shortly, and for a drive round the neighbourhood with him self once or twice a week. Further, he would shortly be giving a small dinner-party, at which she should meet some of the most desirable people obtainable \" in the jungle.\" Delicia began to hope that life in"], [60, "54 Three Brace of Lovers. Ultima Thule would be more supportable than she had imagined. Presently the visitor inquired whether Miss de Ribeau were musical, and was duly regaled with a song. \" Why,\" he cried, with evident delight, \"you'll be quite our prim a donna here, eh \u2014 Mrs. Pyne ? \u2014 our Jenny Lind, don't you know ? You should get your aunt to sing too, Miss de Ribeau, eh ?\" \" Do you sing, Aunt Sybil ? I had no idea you were musical ; though, of course by-the-by, all these are your songs.\" There was just enough patronage in her tone to set Bissett's teeth on edge once more. Now, in Chatterby it was always considered a privilege to hear Mrs. Pyne sing, and Delicia was soon ready to acquiesce in this verdict. Aunt Sybil chose on this occasion Schubert's \" Peace,\" and as the well-trained voice rose and fell some of the song's infinite repose stole over her audience\u2014 or, strictly speaking, over two of them, for the honest major found it somewhat dull, and would have much preferred a Christy. When the last chord had been struck, Delicia walked over to her aunt with sparkling eyes, and leaning over her with a prettily caressing gesture, murmured : \" Oh, Aunt Sybil, it is a treat to hear you ! and"], [61, "\" Why,\" he cried, with evident delight, \"you '11 be quite our prima donna.\""], [62, "56 Three Brace of Lovers. I 'm almost ashamed of having sung before you. Were I to study for years and years, I should never sing like that !\" This little speech was certainly the most gracious and graceful performance of Delicia's since her arrival ; but it only served to vex the obdurate Bissett, as serving to mar the completeness of his indictment against her. After the music followed a period of local gossip, to which Miss de Ribeau listened with the tolerant good-nature of a person who is much above that sort of thing; and then the major rose to make his farewells. \" I must tear myself ... eh, Mrs. Pyne ? . . . expecting me at the whist-table, don't you know ? Good-bye, Miss de Ribeau; don't forget you're to dine with my sister and me next week. She'll call on you to-morrow, and all that. Coming down to the Club, Bissett . . . black-pool wha' . . . ? No use asking you, I suppose ?\" Bissett generally stayed at home on Saturday nights, but, to the major's surprise, jumped up with alacrity on this occasion. Mrs. Pyne sighed as he disappeared. Delicia, finding it somewhat dull after the departure of the men, permitted herself to be a little tired after the fatigues of her journey, and was easily persuaded to retire early. Mrs. Pyne, how-"], [63, "Three Brace of Lovers. 57 ever, lingered over a book for long after her niece had said \" Good-night,\" and was ready for a talk with Bissett on his return. Knowing that he was thoroughly ruffled, she thought it unlikely that his temper would settle into its natural channel until a sluice or two had been opened. Accordingly, as soon as she heard the latch of the garden-gate, she went forth to meet this irritable son, presently adjourning with him to the iron workshop that he might smoke the pipe of peace \u2014 that is to say, might smoke and rail against women for she presumed his outburst would be in that direction. To a man of Bissett's hot and nervous temperament, peace only comes by way of reaction after storm. Bissett installed his mother in the best chair to be had, and himself stood by the window, through which streamed a flood of moonlight, obviating any necessity for lamp or candle. He was not looking at the meads gleaming palely in moonlit haze, but sideways at the bedroom window above the drawing room \u2014 the best in the cottage, just vacated by Mrs. Pyne in favour of her niece. \"I know what she's thinking of,\" he began, biting savagely at his favourite pipe ; \" she is think ing of the profound impression she has made upon us, and how exalted we must feel in the possession of such a guest.\""], [64, "58 Three Brace of Lovers. \" Yet I think your cousin's a little afraid of you, dear lad.\" \"Afraid ? She fears nothing in the world except that we may not be sufficiently impressed with her superiority.\" \" She is a little conceited,\" said Mrs. Pyne gently; \"I quite admit that.\" \"A little conceited? Good Heavens! she's nothing but a breathing image of clotted arrogance.\" \" My dear Bissett ! \" \" She pretends, forsooth, to care something for family, but, like all her sex, cares not a jot for any thing but money and show.

His mother seldom talked about herself \u2014 her life being regulated on the presumption that his happiness was the only thing worth thinking about, \u2014 thus, even so mild a complaint was impressive from its rarity. She had fallen upon bad times \u2014 this view of the situation had not been present to him during the evening ; being a man, he had naturally conceived himself the chief and central sufferer. He glanced uneasily at his mother. The clear moonlight emphasised the pallor of her face and the lines which Care had written upon it. The disturb ance of her household by an unwilling guest, the stormful condition of old Hester's temper, not to mention the crossness of Bissett himself, and the various little anxieties belonging to the situation, had been rather trying to a delicate woman like Mrs. Pyne, and she looked somewhat overwrought. The new-comer, moreover, promised to be a thorn in the side of the little household for many a long day to come ; yet how patient she was, and always had been !"], [66, "60 Three Brace of Lovers. Bissett began to think that after all he himself cut a less pathetic figure under present circumstances than did this gentle, uncomplaining mother of his. \"We must make allowances for Delicia,\" said Mrs. Pyne presently. \" In place of a mother, she has had this Mrs. Longhurst, whose influence can't have been very wholesome ; while as for her brother, I remember him as a selfish man of the world in his seventeenth year.\" \" I dislike everything about her,\" Bissett insisted, \" her looks, manner, voice, way of thinking, \u2014 and heavens ! what an ear for music ! \" \"There's something pathetic about that singing, Bissett ; think how she must have been flattered and deceived by one master after another.\" \" Well, in the matter of encouraging her musical talent, human depravity has surpassed itself, I must say.\" Mrs. Pyne laughed, and allowed her son to rail on unchecked. Yet in the whole course of his indictment, Bissett never once touched upon what was really \u2014 though he was himself unaware of it\u2014 his central grievance against the visitor\u2014 her beauty. Delicia's physical charms had done more to upset his mental equilibrium than all her moral failings put together. He couldn't possibly afford the luxury of falling in love, but deep down in his consciousness \u2014"], [67, ". Three Brace of Lovers. 61 deeper than vanity would permit him to look \u2014 there lurked an uneasy dread of Delicia. It would be advisable to come home as seldom as possible, and always to keep a mental list of her failings ready to con over whenever her prettiness threatened to over power his judgment. Meanwhile it was well to begin by abusing her, for it is always fortifying to disparage the person who frightens you. \"Well, mother,\" Bissett at length concluded, after talking himself back to comparative rationality, \"it's high time for you to go to bed now. I'm going to sit up and do a paragraph or two about the innate vulgarity of woman, just by way of composing myself. To-morrow I shall be a mere lamb ; we'll take miss to church in state, and hear her sing hymns out of tune. Good-night, best of mothers ! \" \" Good-night, dearest and best of sons ! \" \" Mother, you really must depart ; your charity is demoralising. You'll take all the spite out of my pen if you stand there any longer.\" From this brief hint it will be gathered that Bissett had a failing even more reprehensible than that of pride \u2014 that is, a weakness for dabbling in ink."], [68, "62 Three Brace of Lovers. \u00bb CHAPTER IV. \" m\\'y,7rsJi OU see, I'm trenching this bit of TT- \\ / 7%, kjkcr'-l \\s grouni^' Hugo, and I throw the 'top rST -A- - /-' spits ' of No. i into the bottom of No. Jl. g&. spits' of No. i into the bottom of No. ISlPsi 2, and so on.

Then there are the white currants to pinch and prune, but I forget when it ought to be done. I get through a lot of hoeing, anyhow, though I 'm bound to admit that I frequently hoe up seeds or young plants, which makes a man look like a fool. Fact is, you know, I've mugged it all up in the book, but most of it has slipped my memory again, and the confounded book's lost. When do you plant Brussels-sprouts, do you remember ? and how do you manage 'bastard-trenching,' as it is called?\" Hugo shook his head with much gravity ; he was rather a well-read man, but had not the least idea how or when to plant even a potato. \" I should get a practical gardener to give me a hand, if I were you,\" he suggested."], [69, "Three Brace of Lovers. 63 \" Nonsense ! \" cried the colonel, irritably ; \"I'm here to save money, not to pay men to do the work for me.\" \" Hoeing up seeds must be rather bad economy, though, cousin.\" Col. Treveldoe only growled and threw down his spade, and they walked into the little grass field which connected the garden with the river-bank. Backed by dense oak-woods, the ivy-clad cottage looked picturesque enough as viewed from this field, yet the colonel sighed rather mournfully as he looked back at his new home. He had been there three weeks, but as yet had quite failed to get used to the place. He missed the pleasant gossipy hours at his Club, and all the seeming trifles that had gone to make up his life. He had no gift of imagination, such as might have given some touch of glamour to the cottage routine ; the solitude oppressed him strangely, and literature was a blank page to him. Without looking for much pleasure in this life of renunciation, he had yet hoped to find it less burden some and depressing than it proved to be. But Hugo, who, according to his cousin's fore cast should have deserted in a week at latest, was settling down quite comfortably in the rustic quarters. Habits contracted during his German University days now stood him in good stead. His neglected violin was taken up again and practised"], [70, "64 Three Brace of Lovers. vigorously, mainly on the river, since the colonel hated music with the virulence of a true Philistine. His taste for literature, too, showed symptoms of reviving ; and, in addition to some cultured tenden cies, he had a happy knack of sucking pleasure from every-day amusements, provided they were new. Fortunately, his latest fad \u2014 instantaneous photo graphy \u2014 was still in its first freshness ; the hand camera had not yet ceased to be a delightful toy, while the boat-and-barge life of the river offered a succession of subjects. He had a little fleet of his own also \u2014 a Canadian canoe, a luxuriously-cushioned punt, and two or three sculling-boats ; and a good deal of time had been spent in superintending the construction of a boathouse for their reception. In short, with one occupation and another, his time was fully occupied. Moreover, as has been previously hinted, this seeming pursuer of the whim of the moment had a certain definite object in view, over and above that of testing the pleasure possi bilities of a rustic life. But this whimsical Hugo, as a really kind-hearted fellow, sympathised with his disconsolate companion. \" It's my old friend. Ironical Destiny, at work again,\" he remarked, as they strolled down to the boathouse. \" You've got to live here, and hate it ; I needn't, and like it. And, alas ! Julia is quite un aware of the sacrifices you 're making for her sake.\""], [71, "Three Brace of Lovers. 65 \" Of course she is ! \" grunted the colonel, moodily throwing himself down upon the grassy bank. \" I don't quite see how you're going to carry on existence with nothing but kitchen-gardening for work and play both, Chief Hullo ! \" \u2014 Hugo broke off abruptly, and stared across the river, \u2014 \"a punt-load of youth and beauty abreast of us ! \" \" Yes,\" said the colonel, with a wistful glance, \" these Chatterby folks are always on the river enjoying themselves.\" \" Hi ! Treveldoe, old boy, is that you ? Here, bargeman, pull up that old crock of yours, will you ? \" The voice was that of Major Clinton ; the punt was also Major Clinton's, and the people on board were his guests ; the horse which drew the punt, and the bargee who drove the horse, were his property for the day. The major did everything in this easy fashion. He was going fishing now ; that is to say, he was going to watch some rods and floats, while his servant, who was to meet the party a mile or so further up, did the baiting and other work. \" That must be old Treveldoe, who commanded our regiment in India for many years,\" he muttered to his party. \" They told me at the Club that some one of that name had taken this cottage, together with a friend, who 's said to be a photographer, or something of the sort.\" 5"], [72, "Three Brace of Lovers. 66 \" One of the Treveldoes of Stratton-Porth- Treveldoe ? \" asked a dainty young person in cream white. \" Yes, that 's the family, Miss de Ribeau ; dates back to Noah's Ark, I believe.

Wha' . . . ?\" muttered the major; \"and how the doose does Treveldoe come to be living with a photog . . . , eh ?\" Hugo chuckled, seeing the major's doubtful atti tude, and perfectly comprehending what was going on in his mind ; but, nothing daunted, the supposed tradesman quickly shot his canoe alongside the punt. The heavy major was trans - shipped with some difficulty. \"He doesn't look quite like a man of that class,\" murmured Delicia, as the canoe was re crossing the placid river. \"Well, everyone says he is going to take the photographer's shop and studio near the town bridge.\" Mrs. Pyne smiled as she said this, for she had met Hugo once or twice in Chatterby High Street, and formed her own opinion about him."], [73, "Three Brace of Lovers. 67 \" I haven't seen you for years, old boy ; what on earth are you doing down here? \" asked \" the lazy major,\" grasping his old friend's hand. \" Playing the pauper,\" answered the other quietly. He was highly pleased at the meeting, but, on the surface, unemotional as usual. \" Well, you must join our little society at Chatterby, and the Club too, and let us see some thing of you\u2014 eh ? Come now, I 'm going perch fishing, Treveldoe, and have got some ladies to look after the lunch for me \u2014 you must join us, old fellow. You remember young de Ribeau, of Ours ? \" \" Yes \u2014 the most worthless young cub of a sub altern I ever had.\" \" Eh ?

I 've got some tiffin on board, too, and some decent claret, and some of your old favourite weeds : come on, old fellow ! \" The colonel looked down at his gardening trousers, and sighed. \" I wonder if the fish in this lazy river ever rise to a fly ?\" he muttered, reflectively. \" Rather so,\" put in Hugo. \" My bargee friends tell me the chub and dace rise well in the gravelly parts higher up.

There was a lot of work to be done, but . . . the temptation was too strong : he vanished into the cottage. \" Nice weather ?\" began Hugo, conversationally, as he shipped the big major again. \"Wha, . . . ?\" \" Where are you going to fish ? \" \" He 's fishing \u2014 for an invitation, confound him ! \" thought the major; \"but I'm not going to ask him.\" Hugo, who had a large vein of schoolboy \"cheek \" in his composition, resumed cheerfully : \" I expect you 're not given to throwing a fly much, you 'd find it too fatiguing ? \" \" Confound your impertinence ! What d'ye eh?\" Hugo laughed so as nearly to upset the canoe. \" I 'm a photographer, he explained, \" and so accustomed to studying the human countenance, and you strike me as looking contemplative, that 's"], [75, "Three Brace of Lovers. 69 all. Shall I take a picture of yon punt-load ? I 've got a hand-camera close by, and the ladies' parasols, with their reflections, will make a nice ' note.' \" But the major was in high dudgeon. He left the canoeist without reply, or even so much as a word of thanks. \" A counter-skipper, by Jove ! \" he ejaculated, as he settled himself upon the cushions of the punt, \" and fished for an invitation, and wanted to photo graph us all. Wha' . . . ? \" \u25a0>\" \" And he really looked almost like a gentleman,\" Mrs. Pyne suggested, with a private twinkle in her eye. \" Almost, but not quite,\" said Delicia, correc tively, \" though it is surprising how good-looking these sort of people are sometimes.\" \" They 're human beings, like ourselves, you see,\" laughed Mrs. Pyne; \" at least, I 've been told so, though it doesn't seem a generally accepted truth.\" \" Start the old horse again, bargeman,\" drawled Major Clinton, lighting a cigar, and already for getting his ill-temper ; \" if we don't get under weigh again soon,\" he added, with a lazy chuckle, \" Mr. Hand-camera will be sitting down to lunch with us yet, eh ? \" \" I do think,\" Delicia continued, reflectively, \" that it is an impertinence for a mere tradesman to wear a long moustache like that.\""], [76, "Three Brace of Lovers. 70 \" Looks like a cavalry subaltern, doesn't he ? \" chuckled the major. \" No, no ; there was a something about him that betrayed the shop. I felt he was no gentleman. Certainly your friend, Col. Treveldoe, must be an odd man ?\" \" Rather viewy, don't you know ? always had queer notions. Thinks that, as a man of ancient blood, \u2014 descended from Jacob or Esau, I forget which, \u2014 he can associate with anyone. I don't approve of that sort of thing myself.\" \" Nor I,\" added the fair critic in white. The dripping tow-rope was now tautened, the old horse took to his collar, and the punt glided placidly on its way. In ten minutes' time Col. Treveldoe was ready, and as eager for the day's outing as a loosed school boy, though he looked as uninterested and uninter esting as ever. Hugo was also in good spirits. He was relieved to think that the honest colonel, who had been somewhat peevish, as well as dull, lately, was now in a fair way towards getting a little companionship and amusement. His own immediate prospects, too, were satisfactory : he had on board a copy of As You Like It, a volume of Moliere, and his hand camera, and proposed to lunch at Winkleigh, after wards exploring the higher reaches of the river."], [77, "Three Brace of Lovers. 71 The weather was worthy of the leafy month now drawing to its close, the June sunshine full of warmth and sparkle. The gentle breeze was wafting across the reaches the scent of new-mown hay ; the meads were a blaze of golden buttercups and iris ; dazzling white water-lilies gleamed here and there in rushy bays, and blue forget-me-nots answered the smile of the summer sky. It seemed that the idle boating life in this lotus-eating land must to-day be a veritable idyll. The excellent but commonplace colonel took no heed of the beauties of Nature, but did remark that the fine weather made him hungry, and thereupon urged Hugo to quicken his stroke. Presently the flat meadows gave way to hanging woods of oak and ash, and the stream narrowed. \"Good!\" said old Treveldoe ; \"we shall be in sight of Ashlands Lock directly.\" Upon turning the next corner they perceived the punt, just about to pass the lock gates. The colonel uttered a sigh of relief. They entered the lock, and Hugo delivered up his passenger, this time making no assault upon the major, but holding aloof, and amusing himself with As You Like It. The bargeman closed the lower gates and opened the upper sluices ; and while the lock-"], [78, "Three Brace of Lovers. 72 basin was filling the two old brother soldiers drank a glass of wine together, and the ladies talked. Delicia was inquiring about Ashland Place, which crowned a low hill on the south bank of the river, and its present owner, Lady Marsh. This Lady Marsh, Mrs. Pyne informed her, was the widow of Sir Jekyll Marsh, who had died about a year and a half since. She had been a well-known Society beauty, and had been married but three months when she lost her husband. Mrs. Pyne had seen her drive into the town sometimes, but did not know her personally ; she could only state bare facts about the young widow. One person in the lock, however, was listening to these bare facts with more interest than might have been suspected from a man so buried in a book. \" Is Lady Marsh at home now ? \" asked Delicia. Mrs. Pyne hardly knew. The place had been shut up for some time, but she believed there was some talk of its owner's return next month. \" You're interested in Lady Marsh, eh ?\" asked Major Clinton, breaking off his own conversation with the colonel. \" Well, you shall make her acquaintance whenever you please, Miss de Ribeau. She is an old friend of my sister, Mrs. Disbrowe, and is, I hear, expected home every day. She 's an"], [79, "Three Brace of Lovers. 73 interesting young widow, very artistic and that sort of thing, don't you know?\" As the major said this the lock-gates were being opened, and both boats now emerged into the open water again. Before them lay a broad straight reach, with the oak woods of Ashlands Court feathering down to the south bank. \" There, now you can get a glimpse of the Court through the trees,\" resumed the major ; \" a fine old place, isn't it ? . . . Why, surely that's Lady Marsh herself? Has she returned already then ... eh, wha' . . .?\" Hugo was not a nervous subject, but his heart gave a sudden fierce leap as he caught these words, while the eyes of the whole party were turned towards a dark-clad figure strolling among the dappled shadows. The figure was that of a tall, slender woman, who was moving away from the river with bent head and listless steps. There was a touch of pathos about this solitary walker, heightened perhaps in some degree by the stateliness of her surroundings. The owner of all these broad acres, they thought, ought somehow to have been a happy wife and mother ; the dusky figure seemed out of tune with its environment. There was an atmosphere about it as of a marred life, which accorded ill, at least from their subjective"], [80, "A tall, slender woman, who was moving away front the river with bent head and listless steps."], [81, "Three Brace of Lovers. 75 point of view, with the actual beauty of the scene, as well as with the ideas of wealth and happiness which it suggested. But the only deeply interested person present did not wait for any comments that the picture might call forth ; he shot away from the major's punt with rapid strokes, and was quickly out of sight. The man who was now sculling so vigorously round the reedy corners would have been hardly recognisable as the lazy-drifting Hugo who stepped into the boat half-an-hour ago \u2014 or, if the same man, he would seem to be slightly intoxicated. Which was almost literally the case, for the potent spirit of romance had got into his veins. After an absence of two years, he had once again caught sight of a well-known profile, and the simple incident had wrought a curious change in him : the vague possi bilities which had originally given Colonel Treveldoe the benefit of his company had in a flash acquired a sudden weight and piquancy. He felt himself upon the threshold of an actual, instead of a potential, romantic idyll, and yet one which contained elements of fascinating uncertainty. Thus there was about the situation a subtle and peculiar aroma which delighted him. He knew not even what course he should follow, nor whether he could bring any plan to a successful issue. For the present, however, he resolved to fear nothing, but rather to let Fancy"], [82, "76 Three Brace of Lovers. have a free brush and a full palette, and leave the idyll to work itself out according to the moulding of circumstances \u2014 a programme suitable enough to his whimsical temper, but which might end in queer complications. While his brain worked his arms were not idle, and twenty minutes of steady pulling brought Hugo to the neighbourhood of Winkleigh, as was evidenced by the frequent appearance, in all sorts of craft, of the Rev. Hugh Mulliner's mauve - and - white colours. Artistically speaking, these boating-coats were of service to the scene, as brightening not a little the placid bosom of the river \u2014 so unlike that of the lively, bustling Thames\u2014 and the rather monotonous greenery of its banks ; yet some among the good folks of these parts were so deficient in \u00e6sthetic perception, or in power of charity, as to pronounce the presence of these innocentgarments a curse to the country-side \u2014 yea, even to call their youthful wearers \" Mulliner's young devils ! .\" The harsh nickname may, or may not, have been deserved : so much depends upon a man's point of view. Some worthy people, for instance\u2014 though not as a rule those who lived in the immediate neigh bourhood of Beechgrove, as Mr. Mulliner's establish ment was named, \u2014 would say :"], [83, "Three Brace of Lovers. 77 \" Here is a clergyman who might very well be taking his ease in some quiet country parsonage, surrounded by his children and books, yet voluntarily giving up his life to the instruction and improvement of young fellows just at the critical period of their entry upon manhood. His rules are strict, yet well-considered ; every encouragement to lead a wholesome out-of door life is given to the students, and certainly the establishment is most select. Have you noticed how Mr. Mulliner's lists of successful candidates quoted in the daily papers bristle with the names of young noblemen ?\" Whereas others, equally worthy, but of a more captious turn, would exclaim roundly : \" The place is a mere sink of iniquity \u2014 the very worst army crammer's in the country. That hoary old rogue will take anyone, provided he'll pay, and will keep him through thick and thin. Where another tutor would expel a boy with ignominy, Mulliner keeps him on, and takes the change out of his father's pocket. He has got together the worst set of young rips in the country. You can hear their drunken choruses down the river any night of the week . . .\" and so on, and so on, in the same strain. How is the truth to be ascertained, when honour able men view things in such different lights? Which pronouncement was the sounder ? \" It is for"], [84, "78 Three Brace of Lovers. the jury to decide,\" as baffled judges always say in their summings-up. Now it chanced that our philosophic Hugo was destined to make the personal acquaintance of the Beechgrove establishment this very day \u2014 an interest ing experience, for which he was indebted to the following incident. He had reached a point within about a quarter of a mile of Winkleigh, and had run his boat into a reed-bed, with a view to enjoying a spell of idleness after his pull, when another sculler, clad in the inevitable mauve-and-white, made his appearance round a bend of the river. Something about this oarsman's figure struck the observer at once. The mauve back was swaying from side to side, the shoulders were hunched up, the head hanging down ; the light skiff wobbled along very slowly, threatening each moment to turn over. In a moment or two, just as another boat shot swiftly round the corner, the first comer caught his left scull in the water-lily stems with which this part of the river was half-strangled, and immediately upset his skiff. The incident being of such an every-day kind, Hugo only laughed, preparing to shove off his own boat in case the swimmer should need a hand. But the craft refused to move ; he had driven it far into"], [85, "Three Brace of Lovers. 79 the reeds, and it was now half aground. He thrust hard against the muddy bottom, but only drove in his oar so deeply as to fix it there. However, the second sculler had now come up, and would of course go to the swimmer's assistance if needful. But . . . but what had happened ? The ship wrecked oarsman was nowhere to be seen. Hugo, glancing over his shoulder, could not detect a sign of him ; but only saw the second man in the act of diving from the stern of his skiff. Then, finding his own boat still immovable, he stepped into the water and struck out for mid-stream. For a few strokes all went well ; then he found himself in the grasp of the water-lily bed. The long stems writhed round his legs, sending quick spasms of fear through him. But a moment ago he had been lazily reclining, watching the dragon-flies, and dipping occasionally into As Yoti Like It ; now he was in actual danger of his life ! With a great sigh of relief, he got free again, after a sharp struggle, and began to look round for the others, whom for a few seconds he had totally forgotten. The boats had floated down some little distance and were now useless. The ripples caused by the plunge of the second man, who happened to be Bissett Pyne, were spreading shorewards. After a moment or two the diver came to the surface again,"], [86, "Three Brace of Lovers. 80 grasping the other by the hair, and the slow current began to bear them directly on to the bed of lilies. Two bargemen were looking on from the bank, shouting for help to someone behind the big bend, and cursing freely at intervals. \" Hold on to him, and I '11 lend you a hand in a moment,\" cried Hugo, striking out vigorously for the pair. Bissett said never a word ; the man he held was insensible, and could only be kept afloat by dint of great exertion. Hugo was quickly alongside him. They made a joint effort to tow the half-drowned man away from the lily-bed. But his feet were already entangled ; they could barely, by their united efforts, keep his head above water. Meantime help was approaching. The two barge men ran a little way down the towpath, then re appeared flogging the\" old horse which drew Major Clinton's party. The punt came quickly round the bend, and was cleverly steered by the major close up to the ex hausted swimmers, who were thus safely captured, together with their lifeless burden. \" Touch and go, though, eh ?\" cried the major, as he helped to drag the three drowned rats on board. Bissett, who was much exhausted, fainted when"], [87, "Three Brace of Lovers. 81 they had laid him in the bottom of the punt ; but Hugo, who had only come in for the latter part of the struggle, was himself again as soon as he had swallowed a stiff glass of brandy-and-water. Mrs. Pyne was quite unnerved and deadly white ; Delicia gave all her attentions to her aunt. \" Who 's your friend?\" asked Major Clinton of Bissett, as soon as the latter was strong enough to sit up again. \" We can't bring him round anyhow ; he still lies there like a log.\" \"It's McLachlan, one of our men,\" whispered Bissett ; \" he was rather screwed, and I think had a touch of the sun too, before he upset. I was fol lowing him down, fearing some accident of this sort.\" \"Then he's in rather a bad way . . . wha'? You had better run for a doctor at once.\" They were now but a few hundred yards from Beechgrove, which stood, chastely secluded in its own park, on the north bank of the river. It was decided that the two bargees should carry the sick man thither, while Bissett and Hugo hurried into the village for a doctor. The latter started at once ; Bissett lingered a moment or two with a view to reassuring his mother, but was quickly dismissed. \" Don't stay, dear lad, or you'll catch your death of cold standing about in those dripping garments. 6"], [88, "82 Three Brace of Lovers. Please run home and change everything, and put on a very thick jersey, and \" \" The precious lad isn't consumptive, is he? wha' . . . ?\" said the major, hoping to brace up Mrs. Pyne with a little chaff. Bissett, who liked even less than most people to be laughed at, was a little annoyed at his mother's too obvious solicitude ; but his enemy was good enough to come to his rescue. The obnoxious cousin vouchsafed him a look of warm approval. \"You've done well,\" she whispered, \"and I'm proud of my cousin. But you had better be off at once ; for the photographer, as a stranger to your village, might be half-an-hour finding a doctor without you. I'll take care of your mother ; she'll only be anxious if you linger.\" For the first time Bissett found his cousin the reverse of irritating. There was no patronage in her manner just now; and a word of flattery from a very pretty woman, however conceited, has a musical ring of its own. He gave her a half-smile, and marched off along the towpath. \" There, Mrs. Pyne, now we've lost the precious boy,\" quoth the major ; \" and you'll say I 've inveigled you into this expedition on false pretences. I know your only object in coming was the chance of seeing Young Hopeful?\" \"I do hope he'll put on a thick jersey; young"], [89, "Three Brace of Lovers. 83 men are so careless,\" said Mrs. Pyne, rather fret fully, for her nerves were a good deal shaken. \" Well, well, let us have some lunch, and forget all about this little accident, eh ?\" This was a happy inspiration of the major's, and saved some tiresome thinking; for he hated nothing more than the trouble of making up his mind, and, but for this accidental stoppage, might have pro ceeded miles up the river rather than undergo the mental strain of having to choose a halting-place. Yet luncheon, without his man's assistance, meant trouble. \"Where's that fellow Johnson, I wonder?\" he muttered rather disconsolately. Fortunately, Johnson, after awaiting the party for some time at the next lock, now appeared walking down the towpath. The major brightened visibly. \" Now then, bargeman, you take the beer ashore on this bank ; and don't drink it all, ov you'll be get ting a sunstroke. Johnson, you punt us across, and then spread out the things under that willow.\" These orders were promptly obeyed, and the major soon had the satisfaction of running his eye over a dainty little repast spread upon the white table-cloth.

The well of the punt, when opened, displayed a tempting array of bottles ; and Colonel Treveldoe, who had lived for three weeks upon small beer, only hoped his eyes might not be sparkling. \"We've barely escaped your friend, the photo grapher, after all, eh? . . . Wha' . . .? \"laughed the major, after exerting himself so far as to draw the cork of one bottle. \" Is he a photographer, by-the by?\" \" He says so. \" Surely you must know, man, seeing that he lives with you ? \" \" He forced himself upon me, though I'm bound to say his company has been rather a boon.\" \" What's his name ? where does he hail from ?\" \" His name's Hugo \u2014 he hails from London.\" \" Is he an old friend of yours ?\" \" Look here, Clinton, when do you plant kidney beans ?\" At this point in the dialogue, however, Johnson announced that the lunch was served, and the two old soldiers readily dropped conversation for some thing more important. Mrs. Pyne seated herself upon a shawl in full view of Beechgrove, and would have been well content to gaze thereat without eating a morsel."], [91, "Three Brace of Lovers. 85 Miss de Ribeau was busy decking herself with meadowsweet upon the river-brink, when the major summoned her in rather an irritable tone, muttering to old Treveldoe : \"A good luncheon is always thrown away upon women, don't you know ? They care for nothing but frivolity!\""], [92, "86 Three Brace of Lovers. CHAPTER V. UGO'S promptitude in an emergency often astonished those who were little used to him, the truth being that this easy-going, seeming-idle fellow, whose melancholy languor often made busy men feel irritable, chose to show the world but one side of himself. Yet, in truth, when the necessity arose, or the whim seized him, he could \"put in \" \u2014 to borrow the slang phrase of his old profession \u2014 a day's work, whether physical or mental, such as would put most men to shame ; for he had the rare gift of extracting pleasure from either idle ness or energy, which ever circumstances happened to demand. When he volunteered for the Egyptian campaign, the colonel of Hugo's regiment had really felt con scientious scruples in recommending this laissez-aller young captain ; but the very first report from the seat of war was destined to allay these doubts. Hugo proved not only a dashing soldier, but one of the most useful and untiring in the force. His feats soon became the talk of the military clubs. Nor was his old colonel long in learning to brag how he had always known the man \u2014 would have singled him"], [93, "Three Brace of Lovers. 87 out of the whole mess as the very officer for \u2014 etc., etc. Thus it was not surprising that Bissett Pyne fell into a common error about the stranger who had rendered him such good service in the water. When he saw Hugo lounge easily off along the tow-path, he counted upon overtaking him in a couple of hundred yards or so ; but, after running half the distance into Winkleigh, he caught not a glimpse of the flannel-clad figure until he reached the door of the AnglersTnn, when \u2014 behold ! \u2014 the placid stranger was already galloping down the street, bare-backed, to search the neighbouring villages for a doctor. Hugo, it appeared, upon learning that Winkleigh's only doctor had not yet returned from his rounds, had walked straight into the Anglers' yard : and finding no one about, had bridled the only horse in the stables, and started in a twinkling. The aston ished landlord was gazing after the horseman with mouth agape, and told Mr. Pyne that he had never been \" so took aback in his 'ole bloomin' life.\" Bissett reassured the man, and proceeded to his own village quarters to change. For, as Beechgrove was too small to contain all Mr. Mulliner's five-and fifty young military aspirants, many of them were planted out in the village, with a tutor in charge of each small cottage detachment. After donning a dry suit of clothes, Bissett,"], [94, "88 Three Brace of Lovers. whose bedroom window commanded a view of the village street, caught sight of the stranger riding back to the Inn at a foot's pace, looking thoroughly bored and idle, and a little dejected. \" He appears too lazy to climb this narrow stair,\" thought Bissett ; \" but I 'm bound to put a dry shirt at his disposal, I presume ? \" Descending to the street, he thereupon made the stranger an offer of his bedroom and wardrobe. \" My dear fellow,\" said Hugo, \" you 're very good. I '11 come in at once.\" The tutor was somewhat surprised at this familiar greeting, though it happened to be quite characteristic of Hugo, who, as a shrewd observer, very apt at reading people, liked to plunge into friendship for a man at once, if his first judgment were favourable ; but, if otherwise, to have nothing to do with him. He always declared mere acquaintanceship to be the most tiresome relation in existence ; so that friendship, or nothing, had come to be his rule and whim. He put his arm through Bissett's at once, and sauntered placidly away with him, murmuring : \" What a bore life is, with its mill-round of idle ness ! I quite hoped there was a task before me in scouring the country for a doctor, but the tiresome fellow turned up in the very next village.\" Bissett laughed heartily. It was pleasant to come"], [95, "Three Brace of Lovers. 89 across so whimsical a personage, and, to a reserved man like himself, especially so to be addressed in this frankly unconventional fashion. \" Your name 's Pyne, I know,\" said the other, as they entered the cottage, \" for I heard Major Clinton call you so.\" \" Yes, Bissett Pyne.\" \" Ah ! then I know all about you : know your uncle, Sir Bissett ; was yachting with him and your two cousins last summer season. They often spoke of you, and complained that they had lost sight of you lately.\" \"I'm a good deal tied by my work, and have to bury myself down here,\" Bissett explained. Hugo inferred a good deal from this one sen tence, and the shade on Pyne's face as he spoke it. In a very short space of time, though he seemed to be so little observant, he was able to sum up Bissett as follows : \" Has come down in the world ; rather miser able, because poor and proud. The Mrs. Pyne in the punt is doubtless his mother ; a good fellow, from his evident anxiety about her. Too much manuscript about the room : he hates tutoring ; hopes to emancipate himself some day by means of that same MS. \u2014 poor deluded lad ! A good fellow, I say, so of course fails to get on in this crooked world. Rather foolish of me to mention"], [96, "Three Brace of Lovers. 90 his cousins, for he might make enquiries of them ; but no, Pyne's not one of the prying sort. I shall easily preserve my incog, and my liberty a few weeks longer, after which I shall be sick of both.\" \" Suppose we go over to Beechgrove for some lunch ? \" suggested Bissett, as soon as the toilet operations were complete. \" Have you seen any thing of life at a military crammer's ? If not, it may amuse you.\" \"My dear fellow, I've just discovered that I'm starving, and could eat a horse. Pray let us start immediately. You don't know my name yet, by-the by : I'm an idle fellow called Hugo, and I live with a certain Col. Treveldoe in a gamekeeper's cottage down the river.\" \" Then come along, Mr. Hugo, and mind you don't take a header down my narrow stairs.\" Bissett led his guest rapidly out of the village and across the meadows, though his hospitable alacrity was but skin-deep, and he was, in reality, ill at ease concerning the amusement affordable to a stranger by a glimpse of Beechgrove life. Were the head of the establishment at home, the meal might pass off respectably ; but Mr. Mulliner, having frequent calls (generally understood to be of a business nature) to London, was seldom at home for more than three or four days in the week. Probably, as keeping up an expensive staff of tutors, he considered himself"], [97, "Three Brace of Lovers. 91 free to dispose of his time as he pleased. Nor did he take a personal share in the scholastic part of the Beechgrove routine, having given his life, according to general report, to the study of Hebrew \u2014 a subject possessing no vital interest for the military student. Beechgrove, engirt by fine trees, well-shaven lawns, and trim flower-beds, had an air of refine ment and high respectability, as viewed from the gate by which the two young men entered its grounds. Winding along a mossy path among the grey beech-stems, Hugo caught sight of the gover ness and children enjoying a picnic meal in the chequered shade, and was evidently struck with the pastoral atmosphere of the place. Bissett smiled rather grimly at his guest's appre ciative comments, and devoutly hoped Mr. Mulliner might not have gone up to town by his usual train, the 12.20. It soon became evident, however, that this wish would not be gratified ; from the open dining-room windows there issued sounds very significant to Bissett's accustomed ears. They seemed louder than usual, too, owing doubtless to his present nervous anxiety. They passed into the room amid a great clatter of knives and forks and much loud laughter. At the first table were seated most of the younger men, chiefly Woolwich candidates, who were chattering"], [98, "Three Brace of Lovers. 92 like a nest of young rooks, and throwing pieces of bread at one another with genial abandonment. A middle-aged tutor at the head of the table made a feeble attempt to quiet his party when he perceived the stranger, but had long ago recognised the futility of any such effort. Bissett marched on to his own table, at which he always insisted upon at least the outward appear ance of decorum, and seated Hugo at his right hand. The young men in this quarter of the room were more advanced in years \u2014 as also in wickedness. The conversation was less noisy, but of coarser grain. A meal was always a more painful proceeding to Bissett than a lecture, and with a stranger at his side his normal discomfort was naturally increased. Hugo, after listening for a few minutes to the conversation going on around him, perfectly comprehended his host's feelings ; nor was he disappointed at his new friend's handling of the situation. To succeed in clearing the immediate atmosphere, by launching two or three of the talkers upon a harmless controversy about the last county match, and at the same time pay every courteous attention to his guest, was a task calling for some tact and nicety ; and Bissett achieved this successfully. He was lucky enough to be a popular man on the whole, but had been unfortunately compelled to show his"], [99, "Three Brace of Lovers. 93 teeth on one or two occasions lately, thereby making some enemies, as a matter of course ; and some of these, being shrewd enough to perceive his present wishes, were bent upon thwarting him. Thus his task was a difficult one ; but he went on doing his best with unbroken perseverance and dogged polite ness, and the meal could not last for ever. Yet it lasted long enough to make Bissett sick hearted and ashamed ; by the time it was done he had almost lost the power of keeping up appear ances. Through the stranger his enemies had been in a position to punish him heavily, and had seized the opportunity with avidity. Only one thing was in his favour to-day \u2014 the absence of McLachlan. For that jovial Scot, though a personal friend of Pyne's, gave him more trouble than any three of the others put together. The lad had an ingrained taste for rowdyism in general, which nothing could assuage. He delighted in giving luncheon parties at the Angler's to half-a dozen of his friends, afterwards going round the lecture-rooms with a list of them in his hand. \"I s-say, Mr. Peacocke!\" he would exclaim, with his habitual slight stammer, bursting into the geometrical drawing master's room as soon as lecture was over, \" w-was Jones here this after noon ?\" \" Oh, yes,\" old Peacocke would reply, with some-"], [100, "Three Brace of Lovers. 94 thing between a sigh and chuckle, \" Jones was here, trying to draw a square circle !\" \" Ha, ha ! d-drunk !\" Mac would then exclaim. \" Jones is a d d good fellow, and shall lunch with me again next week.\" To-day, however, poor Mac was in his bed, in a very bad way indeed, and the doctor had already summoned Mr. Mulliner home by telegraph. After luncheon, Bissett decided to take the new friend back to his cottage quarters, for the atmo sphere of the little common-room devoted to the tutors at Beechgrove was not a congenial one, being, as a rule, laden with all manner of mutinous growling. Indeed, masters who happened to be much burdened with self-respect seldom stayed long at Mulliner's. The tone of the place was admittedly bad ; and the attempt to maintain dis cipline, unbacked by the head of the establishment, always proved a weariness to the flesh. There are plenty of \" crammeries \" \u2014 if you will pardon the coined word\u2014 of quite another complexion, so that Mr. Mulliner was frequently chagrined by the desertion of his tutors in two's and three's. Old Peacocke stayed on, as being old, and past the stage of hoping for, or caring about, anything very much. Bissett was anchored by his inability to afford the expense of moving the little Chatterby household ; the rest of the staff were usually in a state of flux,"], [101, "Three Brace of Lovers. 95 with just a sediment of incompetents, who occasion ally made convulsive, but futile, attempts to better themselves. But, though he hated Beechgrove with all the cordiality of youth, Pyne had that loyalty which is one of the best traditions of public-school life ; it was therefore against his principles to expose the secrets of the prison-house to a stranger. He kept his guest out of the house as much as possible ; nor would he take him on the river, thick-sown at this hour with mauve-and-white \"blazers.\" Happily the cottage was available as a retreat. For of the three young soldier-aspirants who formed his command, McLachlan was on the sick list ; Gawain, another youth of spirit, was at home with his people to-day ; while the third, by name Chol mondely, was, when permitted to follow his natural bent, the quietest of men. The cottage would be peaceful enough on this occasion, though in periods of storm Bissett had sometimes been driven to sit in the empty village church in order to get an hour or two's repose. With his mind thus eased for a full hour to come, after which duty would summon him to expound the Prometheus Vinctus to his eager class, Bissett was able to make the most of his new friend's company. They sat smoking at the open window, with the gentle stir of the village street going on before them ;"], [102, "96 Three Brace of Lovers. and Pyne enjoyed the treat, so rare in this land of the Philistines, of talking with one who cared for art and literature. Hugo was well satisfied also. After three weeks of the honest colonel's society, a change was not unwelcome. Moreover, it interested him to piece together the young tutor's life from the odd frag ments of admission which even a proud and reserved man will let slip when off his guard. Presently, when their gossip had proceeded for some half-hour or so, a clergyman appeared, walking rapidly down the little street \u2014 a tall robust man of fine presence, who walked with the assured step of one who has solved the problem of life to his satisfaction. He stopped in front of the window, smoothing his fine grey beard, and enquiring with a gracious smile whether he might come in. It was not difficult to guess from Bissett's face that this impressive-looking clergyman was the Rev. Hugh Mulliner himself. Bissett went to the cottage-door without a word, and thereupon introduced the large figure into his little room. Ah ! Pyne had a friend with him ? Mr. Mulliner was indeed sorry to intrude upon them, but need not keep Pyne more than five minutes. No, no ; he would not hear of the friend's with drawing. Mr. Hugo ? He was very pleased to"], [103, "Three Brace of Lovers. 97 make Mr. Hugo's acquaintance, and begged him not to vacate the arm-chair. After exchanging a few easy commonplaces with the stranger, Mr. Mulliner then turned with the kindest of smiles to his young tutor: \" I must thank you and your friend, Pyne, for rendering such efficient aid to poor McLachlan. I am here to speak about him, poor lad. Dr. Herring thinks he will pull through in a few days, but I have thought it advisable to wire for a London physician. You have no idea, Mr. Hugo, what a responsibility these young men of ours are, especially poor McLachlan, eh, Pyne ? But he 's a personal friend of yours, I know ? \" Yes, he was a friend of Pyne's. \" He 's a jolly young scamp, without a bit of real vice about him, eh, Pyne ? \" Bissett had an impression that habitual drunken ness was a kind of vice, in its way ; but he only said : \" McLachlan 's a good-hearted fellow, certainly.\" \"Just so; really a good fellow at bottom \u2014 and you like him, I know. Dr. Herring says his patient has had a touch of the sun, Pyne. You were with him at the time of the accident, were you not ?\" \" Yes, I was following him down, fearing some thing of the sort.\" \"The sun was very scorching about mid-day, eh?\" \" Yes, it was.\" 7"], [104, "Three Brace of Lovers. 98 Mr. Mulliner seemed relieved ; he drew his chair a trifle nearer to Pyne's, and resumed, coaxingly : \" It was about one o'clock, wasn't it ? Do you think the lad had been lunching anywhere ?\" Pyne found it impossible not to smile. Mac's habit of \" lunching \" at all hours of the day was notorious, and Mr. Mulliner's eyes were twinkling. \" Well, look here, Pyne, suppose we make no mention of the luncheon this time ? I don't want the poor lad to get into a scrape with his people. You '11 easily understand,\" he continued, turning suavely to the visitor, \" that a little good-natured blindness is sometimes absolutely necessary in our profession. For what we want is to give the young fellows a fair start by pushing them through their examinations. It would never do to expel a poor lad for his first scrape. My plan is to \u2014 to give everyone a fair chance, and not to report every trifling peccadillo to their friends, eh, Pyne?\" And so Mr. Mulliner flowed on. Nothing could have been more blandly courteous and friendly than his handling of the matter, for he happened to put a high value upon this young tutor. Pyne was, in fact, about the best master at present in his pay ; a scholar, a conscientious man, and a well-connected one \u2014 for it was known that, had his two cousins only been girls, he would be heir to a baronetcy, \u2014 and one who in many"], [105, "Three Brace of Lovers. 99 ways reflected credit upon the establishment. He never took old Peacocke's arm for a stroll in the grounds as he did Pyne's, nor did old Peacocke ever hear from his superior the honeyed phrases to which the younger tutor was well accustomed. Yet Hugo noticed his new friend's cold accept ance of these blandishments, and made a tolerable guess as to their real worth. In truth, like most insincere men, Mr. Mulliner seldom got a full return, at least from those who knew him well, for his large outlay of civility \u2014 perhaps because the quality of self-interest, so useful for work-a-day purposes, is not intrinsically lovable. From strangers, however \u2014 from anxious parents who came to interview the clergyman who was to take charge of their precious boys \u2014 he was wont to reap a full reward. He made a handsome income out of his profession ; every step in his career had been well-judged, from a sensible and worldly point of view. He had \" married well,\" as the common phrase has it \u2014 a phrase through which our innate reverence for a good income expresses itself with such pleasing frankness \u2014 and had at once invested some of his wife's money in the purchase of Beechgrove. Judicious and patient touting had then resulted in the capture of one or two titled young men \u2014 after which the thing was done. The aristocratic yearnings of the British parent are well known : 7 *"], [106, "100 Three Brace of Lovers. where young lords live and thrive, dear Tom and Harry are sure to be well tutored and cared for. Mr. Mulliner was a noted preacher, too \u2014 in short, a worthy and respectable man in every relation ; and he always drove anxious parents to and from the station behind a pair of chestnuts, whose smart appearance was as good as a testimonial. \" And how many honest fellows,\" mused Hugo, when Mr. Mulliner had taken his departure, \" are starving in country vicarages for want of a pupil or two, without capital or impudence enough to make head against the world of snobs ! All is not vanity, I say, but rather humbug and crookedness, and smooth hypocrisy, and mean ambition. Hang it ! even this little glimpse of the world sickens me. I shall be glad to get back to the cottage and my excellent proser-colonel !\" Nevertheless, he was sorry to leave Pyne, when the time came for the latter to adjourn to Prometheus Vinctus and the pleasures of his class. \" Pyne, my dear fellow ! we must see more of each other,\" he exclaimed, as they shook hands at the door of the cottage. \" Nothing I should like better, Hugo. There 's something about you that cheers a man up amazingly, if you '11 forgive so fulsome a compliment.\" \"Cheers a man up?\" echoed Hugo, with his melancholy smile, \" yet I 'm the most pessimistic, cynical, disappointed dog in existence ! \""], [107, "Three Brace of Lovers. 101 CHAPTER VI. HE end of four weeks found Miss de Ribeau, if not reconciled to her fate, at least acquiescing in it with some show of equanimity. She had the buoyancy of youth and health to assist her, and \u00a380 a year for dress and pocket-money \u2014 a miserable pittance, as she often complained to Aunt Sybil, but then the dressing average of Chatterby was of so moderate an order that even her pittance sufficed to keep her well above it. Chatterby could play cricket and tennis rather better than its neighbours, and had other claims upon the world's regard, but, for the most part, its womenkind had not the gift of self-adornment. Yet, despite this grave deficiency, Miss de Ribeau felt bound to admit that Chatterby society was of a better texture than she had been led to expect. She even felt some resentment against one or two of her favourite lady-novelists for imbuing her with the impression that the gentry of a country town must be, in the very nature of things, vulgar and unknow able. None of her aunt's friends were vulgar ; most of them were quite the contrary. Nor did they at present show any symptoms of making that dead"], [108, "Three Brace of Lovers. 102 set at herself which she had anticipated as a matter of course. A certain situation, very frequently present to her imagination in pre-Chatterby days, had not yet been realised : she had not yet found herself in a drawing-room full of wax-flowers in glass cases, purred over by one or two eager-humble attorneys' wives, and listened to with rapt attention by the shabby daughters of some country doctor. The only attorney (she always held to the old fashioned title under which an unfortunate profession has been held up to obloquy by whole generations of writers) of whom she had seen anything lived in a country-house down the river, and was connected with one or two county families. As for the medical ladies, they never called on her at all. It had not occurred to her that such middle-class people could be troubled with pride ; yet what other possible motive \u2014 as she naively asked herself \u2014 could be keeping them aloof? For the most part, her visitors were the families of the old naval and military men who had come to Chatterby for the School and the Club, and she found none of them dangerously pressing in their attentions. They were friendly and civil, that was all ; and the easy-going, old-Indian sort of atmosphere ofthe place was not unpleasant. She met them all at the Tennis Club, on the school cricket-fields, on the river, and, in short, everywhere. The little place was full of"], [109, "Three Brace of Lovers. 103 life and bustle in the summer, and well sprinkled with young 'Varsity men home for the Long Vacation. Among the latter her beauty had already made a considerable stir, so that she probably got quite as much admiration as was good for her, and began to find some real difficulty in keeping up her own impression of being an outcast from the world, a forlorn heroine, worthy of the respectful and chivalrous pity of all mankind. In plain truth, Miss de Ribeau was enjoying herself, though hardly yet prepared to make such an admission. Only one person gave Delicia present dissatisfac tion \u2014 her cousin Bissett. For her own part, she was inclined to like him, which made his insensibility towards herself the more puzzling. This indiffer ence, too, as possessing special and piquing qualities of its own, had the effect of interesting as well as vexing her. Her cousin never quarrelled with her, an omission which was in itself an irrita tion to a warm-tempered girl with a taste for alternate skirmishing and reconciliation with her friends. Bissett treated her with a frigid politeness that rather hurt her feelings ; and while apparently accepting her original conception of herself as a person too innately superior to Chatterby life to be capable of taking interest in it, he yet filled her with an uneasy sense of being in reality despised. Nor could she help noticing that Bissett generally"], [110, "Three Brace of Lovers. 104 managed to time his visits home so as to coincide with her periods of absence. In fair weather, for instance, when she was pretty sure to be at the Tennis Club, he often contrived to get home for an hour on the Wednesday half-holiday ; if it rained hard, he always happened to be engaged with his class. As for Aunt Sybil, she was all kindness, and Delicia was fairly in love with her ; yet even this gentle aunt had caused her a qualm on one or two occasions lately. She missed something \u2014 though at present she could hardly tell what \u2014 in the relations between Mrs. Pyne and herself. The other day, for example, when she had been asked to a quiet game of tennis at the Otleys', her aunt had remarked hesitatingly : \"Well, we'll go if you like, my dear ; but they're quiet people, you know, and have but a small garden.\" \"Are they common, or anything of that sort?\" she had retorted sharply. \" Oh, certainly not ; very well-bred girls, and highly cultured, though they never exhibit their learning.\" \"You, think then, that I care for nothing but money and show, auntie?\" Of course Aunt Sybil smiled away the imputa tion, but none the less had she the discomfited look of one whose thoughts have been read too shrewdly."], [111, "Three Brace of Lovers. 105 Some weeks ago Delicia would not have noticed this ; but the new environment was already affecting the drift of her ideas, and perhaps adding to her perceptive faculties. Saturday had now come round again, and Major Clinton had arranged a river-picnic in her honour. The party was to collect itself, in casual Chatterby fashion, at the Club boathouse, whither Bissett was to escort his cousin. He had promised this much, though declining to commit himself to the picnic as well. Delicia was trying to account for his insistent unfriendliness as she faced her looking-glass in full picnic array. Certainly the mirror's version of her self offered no solution of the problem. The piquante brunette, with the rich olive tints and great eyes, who smiled back at her was not a repelling sort of person, as far as she could judge. The white hat crowning the dark little head was such as would, she knew very well, create a stir of envy in every feminine bosom of the party ; the crisp white gown, with its sly gleams of lemon-yellow, would assuredly increase the stinging power of the hat. Yes, she was worth looking at, whatever Bissett's opinion might be. But the time was getting on ; surely that unheeding cousin would have arrived by now ? She gave a final glance at the mirror, just to verify the good impression already given, and rustled away down the narrow stairs."], [112, "106 Three Brace of Lovers. There was no one in the small drawing-room ; the minute dining-room was empty also, but through its open French window she perceived Bissett and his mother standing upon the lawn, a plot of grass about the size of an ordinary hearthrug. As they were looking up the lane, neither perceived her approach. \" Yes, your cousin is to sing a solo at the Charity Concert next week,\" Mrs. Pyne was remarking. Deliciaought, of course, tohave made her presence known at once ; she could not, however, resist the temptation of hearing what Bissett would say \u2014 at least, just his first syllable. Before the whole word was out she would interrupt him. \" Oh ! \" said Bissett, shortly, \" then I hope she'll sing in tune ; though I have never yet heard her do so. Thank goodness, I shan't be there, anyhow ! \" What had happened ? Almost before Bissett's cruel comment had escaped his lips, a fierce little creature in gleaming white and lemon-yellow, with dark eyes aflame, was standing before him. \"How dare you?\" she panted. \"How dare you ?\" in such a voice that Bissett thought she would have struck him. Then she turned fiercely upon Mrs. Pyne. \"Aunt Sybil, do I sing out of tune? Tell me\u2014 tell me at once ; I will have the truth ! \" A flush as quick as a young girl's dyed the"], [113, "Three Brace of Lovers. 107 delicate old face. For a moment poor Aunt Sybil could not utter a syllable. Always fearing a quarrel, she lived on tenterhooks when these two young people were within speaking distance of one another ; but so painful a climax as this was quite outside her calculations. A tarradiddle would of course free her from the dilemma in a trice, though from a person honest to the core the smallest falsehood comes stiffly. Indeed, honesty might be compared to good ballast, which, while giving ad mirable stability to a vessel, helps to ground her on mudbanks such as lighter craft skim over unchecked. Mrs. Pyne was now hard and fast aground ; there remained only for Bissett to float her off. \" You go in, mother,\" he said peremptorily. \"I'm the culprit, and quite capable of taking care of myself! \" \" Please, miss,\" interpolated old Hester, who appeared suddenly round the corner of the house, \" Major Clinton sends his compliments, and they're waiting for you at the boathouse.\" Delicia was too much overcome with wrath to do anything but glare at Hester.' The old servant waited respectfully, though with a malicious gleam in her eyes. \"Mr. Bissett's been giving it to her,\" thought she ; \" and I hope he'll give it her again ! \" It will be seen that Hester was not as yet recon-"], [114, "108 Three Brace of Lovers. ciled to the visitor. Miss de Ribeau's arrival had, in the ordinary course of things, added considerably to the work of the household, and she was not yet educated up to the point of giving a mere servant the kind word or two which might have converted the extra labour into a pleasure. She had endeavoured to fee Hester, but the huffy old servant had been affronted by the would-be giver's manner, and flatly declined the present. After a short pause, Bissett said coolly : \" I am sorry to have given you pain, cousin ; and I might have been still more so had you taken a criticism which was never meant for your ears with more gentleness and dignity.\" Poor Delicia was baffled now, as well as furious ; her cousin's coolness was even worse than his calumny. \" Do you mean to say that I really sing out of tune ? Answer me that, Bissett ! \" \" I decline to discuss that question with you.' \"I hate you! I hate you!\" she cried, with a break in her voice and every symptom of a shower. \" I'm afraid you do ; for a man without money or position, even though a relative, can hardly hope to win your regard.\" It was a cutting speech, but she had assuredly laid herself open to the knife. Her first attitude towards himself\u2014 a good deal modified since, as he"], [115, "Three Brace of Lovers. 109 ought to have reflected \u2014 was still rankling in Bissett's mind. Hester looked on with perfect outward self control, though with a deep inward yearning to exclaim : \"There, now you've got it, miss; and I hope you like the flavour!\" Poor Delicia fell away with a rain of tears, and a sense that life had suddenly become intolerable. \"Hester, you had better tell Major Clinton's messenger that Miss de Ribeau is unwell this after noon, and will not be able to come.\" \" Say nothing of the sort ! \" cried Miss de Ribeau, \" for I shall be glad enough to be among people who 1\u2014 like me a little.\" \" Then I will escort you whenever you please,\" said Bissett calmly. \" I d \u2014 decline your escort ! \" \" In that case, Hester must put on her hat and take you.\" \" I won't have Hester ! \" Bissett tilted back his flannel cap with the air of a man who has done his best, and is not going to trouble himself further. He was at bottom a little sorry for his harshness, though quite ready to justify it if challenged. Delicia went sobbing indoors ; he strolled out, whistling, into the lane."], [116, "Three Brace of Lovers. 110 In a few minutes she joined him, looking pale, but with a set look about the mouth and a smouldering fire in her eyes. Neither spoke a word ; they passed in dead silence up the lane, and so on into the High Street. People who met them exclaimed : \" What a hand some young couple these cousins make! It's a pleasure to see them together.\" On the whole, Bissett felt he had done well \u2014 very well ; he had been firm, critical, perhaps even a little harsh. If he had any lurking weakness for his cousin, he was evidently capable of keeping it to himself. And yet \u2014 suppose things were to be different ? Suppose success, the radiant Thing which, though so rare, is not actually unknown to human history, were to befall him \u2014 how then ? Would he think it necessary to judge Delicia so harshly on account of a little natural weakness ? Suppose, for instance, he reflected as they passed over the town bridge, that novel, which no one knew he was working at, were to bring him name and fame, would not his opinion of Delicia undergo a change ? She was very pretty, so pretty that he seldom dared to allow himself a good look at her. It was with great difficulty that he had kept away from home last Saturday ; and he now wished he had accepted the invitation to this picnic. What excuse could he offer for joining it after all ?"], [117, "Three Brace of Lovers. 111 Upon reaching the boathouse, they were greeted with a growl from the major : \"Eh \u2014 eh? Come at last? We've all been waiting for you . . . other boats all gone on. Wha' . . . ? Jump in, Miss de Ribeau. Bissett, you're coming too, aren't you ?\" While the major was helping his cousin into the boat and resettling himself with a heavy sigh among the cushions, Bissett was perusing a brief note just handed him by a boat-boy : \" Major Clinton has asked me to the picnic ; scull up here, and let us go together in my Canadian. You're not fond of the ladies, I know; but we'll sit apart and view the sport, and, like Jacques, ' we two will rail upon our mistress the world, and all our misery.' \" Yours, \" Hugo. \"Thanks, major,\" Bissett answered hastily; \"I shall be up the river presently, and will join you later on at ' The Gravels,' if I may.\" \"Ah, you lazy dog! You want to shirk rowing this heavy boat-load, do you ? When I was your age, now . . . Wha' . . .?\""], [118, "Three Brace of Lover*. 112 CHAPTER VII. CHATTERBY picnic was a unique thing in its way \u2014 a simple-hearted, Arcadian proceeding, to be present at which might refresh the heart even of a latter-day cynic. Almost anyone could organise one of these joyous and rambling affairs. You had only to engage every tub-boat in the Club, load the fleet with young people and the materials for afternoon tea \u2014 and after that the thing worked automatically. The most nervous of hostesses could find nothing to fume about in giving such an entertainment. Would not every boat-load find its way, as a matter of course, to \" The Gravels \" \u2014 as a certain side stream was called, \u2014 disembark of its own accord at the old, old spot, and begin, as by clock-work, the old, old game of rounders ? There was a field hard by \"The Gravels\" \u2014 the field, in short \u2014 worn bare, one might almost assert, by these determined picnickers from the town ; yet they never tired of it, nor did it ever occur to them to pitch their camp, say in the next field, for a change. To-day, however, Major Clinton was to attempt"], [119, "Three Brace of Lovers. 113 a dangerous innovation, not in the shape of a change of scene, which must have convulsed Chatterby indeed, but in the way of an irruption of new guests \u2014 to wit, the Dodds and Gawains from Chesning, or, to adopt Bissett's scornful title, \" The Hybrids.\" It must be explained that Chesning and Chatterby were not upon the best of terms at this period. Time was when \u2014 Chesning's social position being less assured, and its charity not yet extinguished by successful speculation, and Chatterby being less bitter and captious than at present \u2014 the young folks of both parties had fraternised well enough, doubt less getting mutual benefit from the process. There upon, however, had succeeded a period of bickering and petty spite, degenerating in due course into downright open warfare, accompanied by rancour, malice, hatred, and the other things proper to a feud of this kind. Chesning lived in Grange, Hall, or Manor House, and claimed to be of the county. It went up to the City every morning in fast trains, being for the most part on the Stock Exchange, or in some wholesale business. It subscribed largely to the hounds, and rode across country as hard and straight as though a dozen generations had gone to make its sportsman ship. Its sons went to Eton or Winchester, its daughters sometimes had a season in Town. It 8"], [120, "Three Brace of Lovers. 114 drove into Chatterby in smart dog-carts, to do a little shopping and to patronise the new vicar, when ever there was one. In a word, Chesning had a hundred claims upon the world's respect, and liked to assert them in frank and manly fashion ; and, if its grandfather was seldom producible, its present environment was beyond reproach. How could Chatterby hope to keep pace with this fashionable village, embosomed in its deep wooded vale ? The notion was absurd on the face of it. The little town was a mere collection of Fortune's derelicts ; its inhabitants, as we have seen, being mostly old soldiers, who, after a life of com parative luxury in India, with horses to ride and plenty of black servants to drive, had to settle into twopenny villas, with, perhaps, a couple of maids ready to give notice upon the slightest pro vocation. On the other hand, Chatterby's grand father had probably commanded one of Nelson's ships of the line at Trafalgar, or a division under Wellington, while Chesning's forbears were in sh . . . that is, in business. Thus, on the one side was the professional class, whose end is genteel poverty; on the other, the trading, whose eventual haven is the Grange or the Manor House, with possibly some dim hopes of a ducal alliance. While, as to their mutual hostility, and the due apportionment of the blame thereof,"], [121, "Three Brace of Lovers. 115 let the sagacious reader settle the question to suit his own sense of abstract justice \u2014 or his preju dices. In the matter of county families proper, it must be admitted with regret that the district in general was somewhat deficient ; and old Lord Chesning, who lived within a mile of the bosky village and might have gladdened the lives of half-a-dozen families around him, would have nothing to do with any of them \u2014 nor did he recognise Chatterby, save as a place of amusement for his servants. Major Clinton, however, enjoyed the rare felicity of being acquainted with Lord Chesning, and, further, of claiming a distant kinship, through a long per spective of second cousins distantly removed, with his lordship, and consequently could not be put upon even by the fashionable Hybrids. The old bachelor, moreover, had a snug little place about midway between the hostile encampments, and delighted not only in keeping up the acquaintance of both factions, but in bringing them together whenever occasion served, as in the case of this picnic. To a man with so much of schoolboy mischief in his composition, the assemblage in one field of these bitter opponents was a genuine treat. Nor was such a consummation difficult to bring about, for the season was now propitious for picnics ; and a married sister, who had come to spend a month or 8 *"], [122, "116 Three Brace of Lovers. two with him, made a willing and graceful hostess. The only difficulty had consisted in the capture of the Dodds and Gawains, who were so apt to have engagements when invited to meet the Chatterby people ; but the cunning old soldier had obviated this in the first place by securing Lady Marsh, whom the Dodds were bent upon cultivating, now that she had come to settle at Ashlands; and secondly, by allowing a rumour to drift up the lanes to Ches ning concerning a certain Miss de Ribeau, Lord Hengist's sister. To bait his trap with an \" honour able \" was, he knew, to make certain of his prey. Indeed, he was well assured that Miss de Ribeau would be promptly taken up and petted by the Hybrid faction, whose carriages the mere aroma of a peer's name would bring to the doer of even the paltriest villa in Chatterby. As he had remarked to his sister just before starting this afternoon : \"We're a pair of fowlers, Mary, and Miss de Ribeau 's our call-bird, eh ? . . . Wha' . . . ? The \" call-bird,\" as we have seen, was not in a mood for doing her piping as gracefully as might have been. At the time of leaving the boathouse she was oppressed with a fit of what the person principally concerned usually calls \" quiet dignity,\" but which the callous onlooker is apt to bluntly term \" sulks.\" In fact, poor Delicia was deeply hurt by her cousin's unkindness. Why was it that he"], [123, "Three Brace of Lovers. 117 always succeeded in making her feel small ? How was it that almost every other man about the place was bowed down with admiration for her, while her own cousin hardly ever looked at her without a sneer in his eyes ? That last stroke of his rankled deeply : \" No man without money or position could hope to win your regard.\" She was repeating the words as she arranged her dainty little person on the cushions of the major's boat. Was there a grain of truth in them ? Of course not. Then why should they annoy her ? Bissett thought her snobbish : yes, that was the word, the most hateful in our language, \u2014 he dared to think her snobbish ! She grew hot under the sting of that most unjust accusation. It was bad enough to be accused of singing flat ; but But she couldn't bear to go all over it again. Instead of doing so, she would adjust herself to play her proper part as Queen of the party, and thus show Bissett how she despised him. She would, as a matter of course, be the prettiest woman present, and the best dressed, and could certainly afford to ignore his existence. It will be seen from this brief glimpse into Delicia's mind that she was not quite as black as the cousin-critic had painted her. Had she been pre cisely the person whom, with the large arrogance of youth, he had summed up and appraised to himself, his indictment would have brought no pang. Per-"], [124, "118 Three Brace of Lovers. haps, too, the influence of Aunt Sybil was affecting the girl more than modest Mrs. Pyne would have deemed possible. The \"lazy major\" was in the best of spirits to-day, not only as a successful fowler who had made a clean sweep of the Chesning coverts, as well as a man of real good-nature who was about to see some two score of young folks enjoy his hospitality, but also as possessing a piquant little secret of his own, which provided quite a vista of entertainment to one who knew how to use it. The secret con cerned that mysterious friend of Col. Treveldoe's, and was at present wrapped up in the form of a letter in the major's breast-pocket. In truth, Major Clinton had, ever since the day of McLachlan's rescue, been troubled with flitting suspicions that he had seen Hugo before, at one of his London Clubs ; and a day or two since had written certain inquiries to an old friend and constant frequenter of that Club. This morning he had received an answer that made him laugh heartily for the best part of an hour, to the torment of his sister, Mrs. Disbrowe, whose curiosity he was careful to pique by many dark hints. He explained that he was in a position to spring a mine upon this quiet neighbourhood, to shake Chesning and Chatterby to their very centres, but that he was not going to spoil a delightful situation by any premature disclosure."], [125, "Three Brace of Lovers. 119 His first step on receipt of the letter was to despatch a note to Col. Treveldoe, begging him to bring his friend Hugo to the picnic. As he now sat between his sister and Miss de Ribeau, chaffing the brace of young Oxford men who were pulling the heavy boat-load, and the half dozen other young people who made up its comple ment, the letter was crackling in his pocket, tickling him to fresh sallies of mirth. Delicia found her genial host, with his good natured chaff lazily drawled forth as they crept along the drowsy river, a pleasant corrective to the caustic ways of her cousin. Her youthfui spirits soon re-asserted themselves ; she laughed as merrily as anyone, trying by many tricks and wiles to induce the major to undertake the steering, a task much too fatiguing for him, and which he eluded with great skill. It ended by Delicia taking the yoke-lines herself, and running the heavy boat stem-on into one reedy point after another ; whereat the rowers showed no symptoms of annoyance whatever, but rather the contrary, for had they not the queen of the party on board ? Once up at \"The Gravels,\" they must needs lose her in the crowd, of whom at least five or six were doubt lessly thirsting for an innings with the new beauty. \"Don't mind us, Miss de Ribeau,\" cried stroke, cheerfully ; \" an occasional contact with the bank"], [126, "Three Brace of Lovers. 120 breaks the monotony, and tends to lighten our toil.\" \" Hear, hear,\" said the youth on the bow-thwart ; \"and when we're tired Major Clinton will scull the party ! \" Everyone laughed at this, while the major threat ened to send them all home to their mothers ; in short, they were all very young and very mirthful, nor was any member of the party in a hurry to catch up the rest of the fleet. They picked up Col. Treveldoe, armed with a lot of rods, at his cottage ; and the major learned, with a satisfied chuckle, that Hugo was to follow shortly. Hugo was, in fact, watching the party from the cottage window ; and, truth to tell, was not a little glad that he was shortly to join them. For, in the first place, there were certain possi bilities connected with this picnic. Bearing in mind how Major Clinton had described Lady Marsh as an old acquaintance of his sister's, Hugo thought it not unlikely that she would be among Mrs. Disbrowe's guests to-day. If this were so, he would meet the young widow in a natural, unconventional way ; for it did not accord with his plans \u2014 or perhaps, more strictly, his whims \u2014 to seem to be seeking her out. Up till now, he had not succeeded in effecting a chance meeting with her such as he had looked for ;"], [127, "Three Brace of Lovers. 121 in fact, had only once or twice caught sight of her in the distance. Now this failure to attain his wishes had made Hugo discontented, and lessened his appreciation of the rustic cottage life with his cousin. He com plained not so much of the discomforts as of the increasing dulness of the atmosphere. The little menage was indeed far more luxurious than the colonel had intended, for their charwoman was an ex-cook in a gentleman's family, and her husband had been pressed into the service as general handy-man. Moreover, Hugo insisted upon doing all the catering himself, thus freeing the colonel for the garden work. How he contrived to \"run\" the little establishment so comfortably at such a trifling cost was a puzzle to the simple old soldier. But certain it was that his own weekly contribution (he always persisted in settling accounts once a week) was ridiculously small, considering how well they fared. No, the physical discomforts were hardly worth mentioning, especially as they lived almost entirely out of doors. What was beginning to tell upon poor Hugo was the constant companion ship of honest old Treveldoe. A good-hearted, worthy man may indeed be a prodigious failure as a home-companion. The very worthiness which gives colour to a man's whole being, and differentiates him from the general ruck"], [128, "122 Three Brace of Lovers. of mankind, may yet go for nothing when you come to live with him. A genuine villain, provided he possesses some wit and humour, may be a preferable companion. The colonel had no ideas \u2014 positively none. He had never read anything ; he seemed never to have thought of anything, save of doing his duty. He would pass the morning plodding away in his gar den, \u2014 then talk about what he had done, while eating a hearty luncheon. Then he would fish through the afternoon, smoking, and perhaps ruminating \u2014 but nothing ever came of the rumination. After din ner of an evening he would go to sleep and snore portentously. No wonder Hugo, the most gre garious of men, began to pine for the society of someone with a trifle more of youth and sparkle than this worthiest of old soldiers. As things were, his only companion was Bissett Pyne, who seldom had a free hour now that a Line Examination was immi nent. Not long after the disappearance of the picnickers Bissett Pyne hove in sight, sculling rapidly up the broad still reach. Hugo thereupon uttered a deep sigh of relief, then hailed his friend with a hearty shout. The moment Bissett landed, he fell upon him : \" Have a weed, old fellow ; and, for Heaven's sake, tell me -ome news while I'm getting out the"], [129, "Three Brace of Lovers. 123 canoe. Talk about the weather, or any mortal thing, provided only you wag your tongue to some tune, for I 'm dying for a bit of human gossip. Tell me all about this picnic ; name every soul who 's coming, including children under ten years. I do assure you that the merest prattle will serve to amuse me.\" Bissett was glad enough to be with this friend who never jarred upon him, and whose society, after a spell of Beechgrove, was always a deep refreshment. He entered into Hugo's mood with alacrity, so that when they presently paddled forth upon the bosom of the placid Drowse, with its glints of summer blue and creamy cloud-reflections, life was beginning to re-assert its idyllic tone for that whimsical philosopher. Hugo clung with curious persistence to the question of whom they were to meet at \" The Gravels.\" He twice made Bissett rehearse the probable list of invited persons, and twice put the same question at the end : \" Are you sure there is no one else ? \" \" Well,\" said Bissett, \" I mentioned all the Dodds and Gawains, didn't I? They're coming, worst luck ; and if Lady Marsh is back at Ashlands yet, she will probably have been asked to meet them. But how does the question interest you, seeing that these people are strangers to you ? \""], [130, "124 Three Brace of Lovers. \" My dear fellow, I 'm a whimsical fool ! Be satisfied with that piece of knowledge. If you give me the least opening, I shall be sure to make a confidant of you, and bore you to death : I'm on the brink of doing it already. You must have wondered often enough why I am masquerading in a cottage down here ? \" \" I may have speculated about you at odd times, but am perfectly content without prying into your affairs.\" \"You're so delightfully proud, Pyne,\" laughed Hugo. \" Another man would have wormed it all out of me long ago, but you would rather be shot at than ask a question. I need tell you nothing ; yet, were the sentimental expansive fit to come over me, I know you'd listen like a brother. Certainly you're the best of comrades.\" Bissett was, however, more curious than he chose to admit, for he detected in these hints the subtle odour of romance, a thing very pleasing to the nostrils of four-and-twenty. What was this man's history ? Whom was he anxious to meet ? Why was he, as he said, masquerading in a cottage ? From his talk, he had evidently been in the army, and had seen service ; also he had been a man about town, and knew the great world. Again, he was an accomplished violinist, which seemed odd in a soldier; and . . . in short, Hugo was a mystery"], [131, "Three Brace of Lovers. 125 and a puzzle altogether. But Bissett, as his friend declared, was much too proud to ask questions ; he decided instead to talk about the weather. And so they progressed lazily, without further threat of confidence on Hugo's part, up the long reaches and round the quiet bends, and in due time came in sight of the whole fleet of picnic-boats drawn up on the shingle under a spreading oak."], [132, "126 Three Brace of Lovers. CHAPTER VIII. PON scrambling up the bank, Hugo found himself confronted by what, but for the fatal modern costume, might have been a scene from some old pastoral play. Just before him was a group of children \u2014 grown-up and other \u2014 playing a lively game, Miss de Ribeau being in the thick of it, together with every flannel-clad youth and boy in the company. A few chaperons\u2014 they were apt to be few and young at all Chatterby entertainments \u2014 were gathered under the big oak, smiling at and applauding the players. At the further end of the mead large sleek cows were browsing, and several more had wandered into the gravelly shallow, seemingly with a view to admiring their own reflections. Just above them was a deep pool, over which leaned Colonel Treveldoe, stolidly watching his floats. Beside him, in white clothes of evident Indian build and texture, and in an attitude that seemed to epitomise thelaziness of an entire hemisphere, lolled Major Clinton, cigar in mouth, tranquilly regarding the colonel and another fisherman who was drifting along in a boat near some old piles ; while upon gleaming meadow and peaceful stream, and laughingyoung folks, slanted"], [133, "Three Brace of Lovers. 127 the late afternoon sun. It was a veritable idyll \u2014 it was Chatterby's innocent summer-life set forth in a single bright picture, summed up in one sunny instant. Hugo felt very young at this moment, almost like a schoolboy with half-holiday blood racing in his veins; then a fashionably- dressed woman came forward with well-bred phrase of welcome, and lo ! he was grown-up again, with the idyll fading into a mere society entertainment. Easy platitudes were exchanged among the very ruins of the idyll, and very soon he was led by Mrs. Disbrowe up to the group under the tree ; and then he wished he hadn't come. He could not help perceiving that his approach caused a little sensation in the party ; there was a"], [134, "128 Three Brace of Lovers. certain indescribable flutter in the group of ladies, who seemed to be entirely wrapped up in the game of rounders. He realised, with something very like angry discomfort, that the interest of the new-comer centred in his doubtful social position. It had, of course, been rumoured that he was a photographer, or something of that sort, a man whom Major Clinton had invited out of deference to his old brother-officer's feelings, and everyone wanted to know what a photographer was like to meet on equal terms \u2014 a real live one, away from the shop and the studio. He had got himself, entirely by his own fault, into a supremely ridiculous position. It was absurd \u2014 charmingly absurd, no doubt, \u2014 and he had thought to enter into the joke with zest, but somehow he was too near the heart of the situation to enjoy it fully. And suppose someone were to arrive, someone he knew, what an unspeakable idiot he would feel ! Meanwhile they studied him furtively. The elder Miss Calshott, who wrote novels, began to make interesting mental notes of the stranger : \"An interesting figure: tall, handsome man, with decided air of fashion, though only a trades man \u2014 a little flushed, doubtless from nervousness at finding himself in Society \u2014 would do well as hero, say millionaire young shopman engaged to a countess \u2014 must get introduced, and note the subtle nuances"], [135, "Three Brace of Lovers. 129 which doubtless differentiate him from men of birth and education.\" Presently Miss Calshott was introduced, and found the said nu-ances so very subtle as almost to baffle scrutiny ; her impressions of this likely model, summed np and put into print, would have made quite a different figure to the one she had been pro jecting. Hugo was, in fact, put upon his mettle just now, feeling somewhat as a medieval knight might have been expected to do upon finding himself in the thick of a fight with his armour left at home. Hitherto he had faced the world in all the panoply of wealth and an unassailable position, and the fighting had been mere play-work ; but now, standing as an unarmed man, with nothing but personal prowess in his favour, he owed it to his self-respect to show what stuff he was made of. It happened that Miss Calshott, as being a person a thought too much impressed with her superiority to her neighbours in the domain of Art and Letters, opened the acquaintance by a rather patronising conversation upon painting, of which a photographer might be expected to have some humble knowledge. Everyone listened, though still apparently absorbed in the game. At first Hugo spoke little, wishing perhaps to test the depth of Miss Calshott's know ledge ; but, as they warmed to their work, it became apparent that he knew more about all Art \u2014 ancient 9"], [136, "Three Brace of Lovers. 130 and modern, Continental and British \u2014 than did his opponent. Miss Calshott was a mere child in the hands of a man who had lingered in every gallery in Europe, and knew personally almost every artist of note in Paris, Munich, and London. Yet Hugo's manner was courteous, almost deprecatory : he seemed to be trying civilly to make the most of what little knowledge Miss Calshott possessed. Nothing could have been more popular than his victory over this too-omniscient lady ; even her father, old General Calshott, who possibly found her conceit somewhat tioublesome at home, was leaning against the oak-bole, chuckling silently at his daughter's discomfiture. The \" lazy major,\" too, had rolled across the grass to greet Hugo, and was a delighted spectator of the combat. \" You should get Mr. Hugo to talk literature with you as well, Miss Calshott,\" he suggested, with his grey eyes twinkling, \"for we're all such Goths and Philistines here, eh?\" Miss Calshott accepted this challenge with avidity, and was soon asking Mr. Hugo's opinion of a certain obscure passage in Pippa Passes, not without a devout hope that he might never have read it. It appeared, however, that this tiresome stranger had read Browning to better purpose than herself. He corrected her quotation, with all due apology, in two places, and expounded the meaning of the whole"], [137, "Three Brace of Lovers. 131 passage with ease. This stroke was too much for poor Miss Calshott ; she fell back, very hot and flushed, with a feeling that everyone present was secretly laughing at her, and withdrew to see how Colonel Treveldoe's fishing was going on. Meanwhile, how was Bissett Pyne passing the time ? He had extricated himself as soon as pos sible from the rest of the party, and was sitting beside the fisherman, alternately watching the colonel, who now and then pulled out a perch about as long as his hand, and the game of rounders. Had the picnic consisted of Chatterbians only, he would not have held aloof; but the Dodds and Gawains might arrive at any moment, and Bissett never could meet these Chesning folk without fume and fret of temper. As Tom Gawain's tutor, to whom it was advisable to extend a little civility, he had dined at both houses occasionally, when they had treated him with a calm patronage that made his foolish young blood boil. It was embittering, too, to reflect that had he chosen to brag of his uncle, Sir Bissett, and certain of his other relations, he would have been treated differently ; while the casual nods that the Hybrids were in the habit of casting him as they drove through Chatterby, and which used to stick in the sensitive lad's mind like poisoned darts, would have become gracious bows. Altogether, perhaps, \" the contagion of the world's 9 *"], [138, "Three Brace of Lovers. 132 slow stain \" had assailed the young tutor ten years sooner than it need have done. The game of rounders was presently endowed with a fresh interest in the person of a new arrival, Mr. Hugo, who, after making a highly favourable impression under the oak, was apparently minded to relax a little among the young folks. Bissett saw him led forth by the major and introduced to Miss de Ribeau ; and thereupon braced himself up for some cynical enjoyment, for Delicia would infallibly snub the supposed photographer. But the cynic was destined to be disappointed. He knew nothing of a little communication whis pered by Major Clinton an hour ago, and somewhat to this effect : \" I say, Miss de Ribeau, I 'm going to give you a part share in a joke that I've got on hand, but no blabbing, mind ! I've just heard that our so-called tradesman is rather a personage, but as he has chosen to make a fool of himself, and of us too, why we '11 run him on his own lines, eh ? Let him take the consequences. . . . Wha' . . . ? And think what a laugh we shall have over everyone that snubs the photographer ! \" Being quite in the dark as to this, Bissett was not a little astonished at his cousin's friendly recep tion of Hugo. She was standing bat in hand \u2014 for the ladies were allowed a bat, while the men played"], [139, "Three Brace of Lovers. 133 with a cricket-stump, \u2014 with a 'Varsity \"Blue\" bowling to her, when the stranger was brought up. The game had to be interrupted for the sake of the ceremony, yet she listened to Mr. Hugo's opening commonplaces quite graciously. Indeed, her con duct all through the game, and evident hearty enjoyment of the whole Arcadian entertainment, had been something like a revelation to Delicia's captious critic. He began to realise that after all she was a mere girl ; that it was possible, barely possible, he might have been a little hard on her. It happened, too, that cousin Delicia was looking very bewitching at this moment. She was young enough to stand the full blaze of the summer sun without detriment to her beauty. The high lights to her creamy apparel finely emphasised her dark rich colouring, and her eyes were sparkling with triumph ; for had she not done good service to her side, to the delight of all her admirers ? But for his quarrel with her, Bissett must have joined the game ; it was exasperating, now he came to think of it, to be watching the colonel's tiresome red floats and listening to his commonplace remarks, while other men were making much of his cousin, showing her how to hold her bat, and so forth \u2014 confound them ! And here was Hugo joining the ranks of her admirers now, standing near and giving"], [140, "134 Three Brace of Lovers. her hints Ah ! who caught that ? Delicia was out at last ! But matters did not mend. Hugo walked off with her along the river's bank, and it was clear that the pair found each other interesting. \" Hum ! \" grunted the old soldier, taking' his eye from his float for just one moment, \" Hugo's at his old games, I see ! \" \" How do you mean ? \" Philandering after the pretty women ; he always did, and always will Hah! another bite ?\" Bissett jerked himself to his feet, looking rather savage. He could not understand himself this afternoon ; but his fit of irritation, from whatever cause it might arise, had now something definite to fasten upon, for at this moment a waggonette and pair came bowling along a farm-road which traversed the next meadow \u2014 the Hybrids were at hand ! Mr. Dodd himself\u2014 the great Mr. Dodd, who had come to be one of the most distinguished figures in the neighbourhood \u2014 was drivingthe party. As he pulled up his blacks at the field gate, taking in at a glance the rounders, the fishing, and all the rustic simplicity of the entertainment, he snarled out in a loud tone: \" Good God ! what a set of gabies ! \" The master of Chesning Grange and head of the great Stock Exchange firm of Dodd, Larks, Gawain, and Co., was in the habit of thus simply and freshly"], [141, "Three Brace of Lovers. 135 expressing his feelings. He was a big, powerful man, in rather a loud checked suit. His face was some what bloated : his scraggy black beard looked wiry and irritable ; his nose was too thick and bulbous to be called handsome ; his small eyes were full of sardonic contempt for the world in general, especially for that large proportion of it whose income is not worth taxing. In short \u2014 to borrow for a moment his own admirable frankness \u2014 he was a man with the outward appearance of a rich publican and the speaking voice of a bargee. But then, he also had forty thousand a year. Mr. Dodd's two daughters, together with Miss Gawain and a couple of Bissett's pupils \u2014 to wit young Tom Gawain and that jovial Scott McLachlan, now happily recovered of his sunstroke, \u2014 jumped to the ground with more haste than dignity. For it was clear that Mr. Dodd's rooted objection to the folks of Chatterby was just now coming to a climax, and the briefest delay might end in his driving the party away again. However, they scrambled over the gate before he had time even to swear with any heartiness, and so left him with no one to swear at. The Miss Dodds moved forward briskly, followed by their escort. They were smart young women, and the fashion of the hour being of a masculine cast, they resembled as closely as might be a brace of moustache-less young subalterns. As they were"], [142, "136 Three Brace of Lovers. the leading spirits of Chesning, moreover, Miss Gawain's style was always a humble imitation, tending occasionally to travesty, of their own. They all three wore the look of complacent superiority with which they were wont to confront a Chatterby gathering. \" Here we are,\" they seemed to say, \" descending from our sphere, yet quite willing to be talked to ; don't be afraid ! \" They passed so close to Bissett, that absorption in the angling was hardly compatible with the fitness of things; he felt obliged to look round. They nodded quite graciously, and seemed willing to go even further ; but the ruffled tutor was not in a mood to add the pangs of patronage to his other grievances against Fate. He returned their bow with all the hauteur of four - and - twenty and nothing - a - year. The young lady subalterns looked just a shade crestfallen. Mr. Pyne, though a tutor, was undeniably a pretty fellow, and a little bird had yesterday, about 3 p.m., informed them that the Hon. Miss de Ribeau was his cousin. By 3.30 p.m. they had decided to call upon Mrs. Pyne, and had quite intended to be civil to her son this afternoon. The two young men hung back for a moment or two to have a look at the fishing. McLachlan was rather sober, for him; and good-natured Tom"], [143, "Three Brace of Lovers. 137 Gawain, with his round face and fatuous smile, was full, as usual, of facetious geniality. \" Hullo ! governor,\" he cried, addressing the placid colonel, \"pull up, you've got a bite !\" This was a standing local joke, hurled by passing bargemen at every Waltonian upon the banks of Drowse. \" Who the devil areyou ? \" growled old Treveldoe, turning sharply round. \"A w-worm at one end and a f-fool at the other \u2014 evidently an irate one!\" murmured Mac, in an audible aside. \"What are you fishin' for \u2014 tittlebats?\" asked Tom, nothing abashed by the colonel's indignant tone. \" D-don't talk so,\" murmured Mac, whose quiet voice and slight stammer Colonel Treveldoe found more irritating than his friend's frank impudence ; \"you'll spoil the gentleman's sp-port.\" \" Perhaps I had better introduce you to the gentleman?\" suggested Bissett drily. \"This is Colonel Treveldoe, who lately commanded the Blue-green Fusiliers, the regiment you hope to get into. Colonel Treveldoe, let me introduce one of the quietest and hardest-working of our military aspirants \u2014 Mr. McLachlan.\" \"Oh, damme ! \" cried Tom the irrepressible, \" did you command the Blue-greens ? Then you must know my old pal, Jim Fanshawe?\""], [144, "138 Three Brace of Lovers. \"Yes, I do; and he's just such another un licked, mannerless young cub as yourself!\" \" Give it him again, Colonel Treveldoe ; Tom wants a deal of snubbing ! \" cried Mac, with his quiet chuckle. The colonel was adjusting himself for a shot at Mac himself this time, but the canny fellow mollified him by a single apt question : \" Do you get any chub about here ?\" For a moment the colonel stared doubtfully at his interlocutor, but Mac looked as solemn as a judge; it was difficult not to be softened, for the old soldier had a veritable craze for angling, and seldom got a gossip upon his beloved topic. Seeing that an armistice was probable, Bissett judiciously drew off Master Tom \u2014 a simple feat enough, since the fatuous lad had a genuine admira tion for his tutor. \" Pyne's a d d good fellow,\" he would often declare to his friends, \"and he'll shove me through my ' Prelim.' if mortal man can perform that miracle ; and, what 's more, he '11 pass Mac among the first ten \u2014 if we can only get the beggar to the post sober.\" Tom would even confide his domestic troubles to Pyne, declaiming about the plainness of his three sisters, and the consequent labour devolving upon himself when he took them out to balls."], [145, "Three Brace of Lovers. 139 \" I have to give them a couple of dances each myself, by Jove I do!\" he would sigh, \"and it's doosid rough on a man to have such gawks to look after. I wish we could marry 'em off, I know ! \" As they strolled along the river-bank now, he was describing gleefully how he had baulked Maisie and Agatha of to-day's picnic, and had almost succeeded in choking off Miss Gawain also. \" But your cousin spoilt my game there,\" he concluded regretfully ; \" there 's no holding a woman when she sniffs an ' honourable.' Lord bless you, the Dodds are thirsting for your cousin's acquaint ance ; damme, sir, the whole of Chesning is ready to quarrel about her ! Ha ! \u2014 look ! the Dodds are going for her already. I bar those girls; they're second-rate people, yet my sisters will found them selves upon the Dodds, and accept them at their own estimate. I hear Lady Marsh has an engagement this afternoon, but is to put in an appearance later on, before the party breaks up ; if so, you '11 see my sister fastening upon her, while the Dodds devour your cousin : you wait, and see if I 'm not a true prophet. I understand the women, sir \u2014 always had a natural gift for that, as well as for playin' the banjo.\" Bissett disliked these confidences , but had long ago given up trying to check them. It was as im possible to stop Tom's tongue as to get the Pons Asinorum into his head."], [146, "Three Brace of Lovers. 140 The Miss Dodds had indeed captured Delicia, and were charming her very successfully. It was a significant symptom of their desire to please that they had now been embedded in a group of Chatter bians for a full quarter of an hour without once saying a word about fox-hunting \u2014 a topic which was sure to crop up, no matter what the time of year might be, whenever they found themselves in this society. For, except General Calshott and his daughters, and the two leading butchers of the place, hardly anyone in Chatterby could afford to hunt, which made the subject a safe one for purposes of self-elevation ; nor was it to be altogether neglected on this occasion, as we shall see. The mischievous major took an opportunity, when the elder Miss Dodd had fallen back for a moment, to introduce the doubtful Mr. Hugo. He felt tolerably sure that the popular fallacies con cerning the stranger would by this time have reached Chesning; and Miss Dodd's acknowledgment of the introduction at once showed he was right. Major Clinton watched the little episode with a silent, relishing chuckle. He was certainly punishing Hugo for making fools of them all, and it was highly probable that Miss Dodd would now have to take a share in the punishment. Hugo was, in fact, something more than upon his mettle this time. He found Miss Dodd's manner"], [147, "Three Brace of Lovers. 141 nothing short of insulting ; insomuch that, unused as he was to the acceptance of snubs from anyone, he felt that peculiar thrill of injured pride with which poorer men are so familiar. To feel this was to resolve at once upon Miss Dodd's demolition. With Miss Calshott, whose desire had been merely to show off her own learning, he had dealt leniently, but for a lady of this stamp he had no mercy. He began by forcing her to talk a little by sheer pressure of will ; almost immediately the hunting question cropped up. At first he allowed her to hold forth and to patronise to her heart's content ; she obviously talked to the general audience, not to himself. Presently he hinted gently that the hunting in this district was understood to be poor \u2014 but doubtless she knew Leicestershire ? \" Well \u2014 not exactly Leicestershire.\" Doubtless, however, she had hunted with many packs in different parts ? He mentioned the points of several leading ones ; but she was growing timid, like a walker on slippery ice. Cross-examination, conducted with much tact and all due courtesy, elicited the fact that she had hunted with no pack but the local one \u2014 a confession which made a bad anti-climax to previous tall-talk. Further, it appeared that Miss Dodd knew little about the sport, and needed setting right upon several important points. Heproceeded to instruct her with the calm superiority"], [148, "Three Brace of Lovers. 142 of an old hand who is good-naturedly desirous of helping a beginner. It was very galling to be treated so in the presence of half Chatterby. Miss Dodd felt herself growing crimson, and presently dropped the subject suddenly, as though it were a red-hot coal. But it would never do to retire thus broken winged. Miss Dodd had pluck, and she meant fighting. After a pause for breath, she plunged into the subject of yachting. Her opponent showed no eagerness for this topic ; but lured her on to brag her hardest, while he listened deferentially. Poor Miss Dodd recovered herself, straightening her neck exultingly. Oh yes, she had done a great deal of yachting ; knew any number of yachting people ; had been cruising about the Solent and South Coast on board a big schooner all last season, and of course had been at Cowes during the regatta-week. A schooner was a vessel with two masts, as perhaps Mr. Hugo knew ? Might he ask the schooner's name ? \" The Desdcmona.\" It was a pity she had to mention this, for Hugo had also been at Cowes during the week ; he also remembered the Desdemona \u2014 a 100-ton schooner, owned by a well-known brewer. \" I think I remember the name,\" he said quietly. \" You picked up your moorings on the first day of"], [149, "Three Brace of Lovers. 143 the Regatta, didn't you, close to Lord Braddington's little yawl?\" \" Ye-es,\" in rather a crushed tone \" You know Lord Braddington, of course, the keenest yachtsman going ?\" \" No \u2014 I believe not ; at least, I don't remember meeting him, but one comes across such crowds of people yachting.\" \" Just so. And as you were at Cowes about that time, we are sure to have a dozen mutual acquaint ances ; for instance . . .\" Then followed a dozen well-known names and titles, to everyone of which she had perforce to answer \" No.\" Miss Dodd felt giddy, almost faint. A dozen people whom she had been patronising any time these five years were listening while this exas perating stranger was quietly, but firmly, establishing her as a nobody. Meanwhile her sister was clinging gallantly to her talk with Miss de Ribeau, though her sense of discomfiture was palpable enough in her strained voice and the quiver of her eyelids. After wringing his enemy dry, so to speak, Hugo stepped aside, as though having done all that politeness required. Miss Dodd would gladly have wept. This little incident was followed by a much pleasanter one \u2014 the picnic meal. It took place under the oak, while the declining sun, pausing upon"], [150, "Thc picnic meal."], [151, "Three Brace of Lovers. 145 the rim of the low hills from whose lap the Drowse seemed to have sucked its dreamy quietude, poured orange light upon lustrous meadow and browsing kine. It was nominally a tea-picnic, but with that hospitable old Indian, the \" lazy major,\" the expres sion \" tea\" was always understood to mean a solid meal, with champagne and other enticing drinks ; and its meaning to-day was, if anything, more com prehensive than usual. Major Clinton had indeed surpassed himself, and his party was an obvious success. Even the Chesning detachment failed to strike a discordant note on this occasion ; the Miss Dodds had grown meek and unassuming as lambs. As for Tom Gawain and McLachlan, they made of themselves mere serving-men in their anxiety to anticipate the wants of the young queen of the party ; while Mac's activity generated a thirst which began to have a serious effect upon his stammer. Probably Bissett Pyne was the only unsatisfied member of the party. He was uneasy about McLachlan, for one thing, since he could gauge Mac's sobriety to a nicety by the condition of his stammer, and knew him to be fast approaching the sentimental stage. At any moment the man might make Delicia conspicous by some silly speech or other ; but how to get him away from her side ? Not wishing to make their little quarrel public, 10"], [152, "146 Three Brace of Lovers. Bissett hesitated to approach his cousin ; but pre sently she herself grew nervous, and gave him a glance which decided him at once. He whispered to Mac that it would be wise to make the most of Colonel Treveldoe, who probably had a good deal of interest with the old regiment ; whereupon Mac started up, filled his glass once more, and carried it round to where the old soldier was sitting with General Calshott, engaged in making a hearty meal behind the ladies' backs, and wishing perhaps that Julia were here to share his pleasure. Bissett took the vacant place beside Delicia with rather mixed feelings. He was now, however, to discover a pleasing feature in his faulty cousin's character ; viz., that she was rather good at for giving. It seemed that she could give and take a knock or two without bearing malice afterwards, a virtue which her cousin now recognised with some inward qualms. \"You haven't come near me all the afternoon, Bissett ? \" she began rather timidly. \"Well, it's rather good of you to interest your self about my presence or absence after \" \" Oh, I never bear malice ; really I 'm not spiteful, though I know you think poorly of me in most respects.\" \" Do you think me such a hard critic, then ?\" \"Yes, I do.'"], [153, "Three Brace of Lovers. 147 Bissett smiled at her less coldly than he was wont to do \u2014 indeed, almost warmly. Other people seemed to think so much of her ; every man present, ex cepting his critical self, had been doing his best to spoil her \u2014 yet she could be forgiving ! The forgive ness of a very pretty woman, too, has a pleasing flavour, very soft to the palate. Bissett felt somehow younger than he had done lately, less bitter, more charitable. It seemed that he was not too old for enjoyment after all. Delicia's eyelashes were really remarkable, and her face like a flower \u2014 a small flower, rich of hue and crisp of outline. Yes, and it really was a perfect evening, and everyone looked happy. It was a moment for a man to relax in, to forget the hateful money-question and the weariness of the tutorial treadmill, and to think what life might have been if only everything had not gone wrong. While Bissett thus indulged himself, Tom Gawain prattled on like an artless schoolboy. Delicia listened to him smilingly ; but she too was enjoying the pleasure of \" making it up,\" though she and her cousin did none of the talking. Presently, when the flaming orange of the west had faded into a gentle amber glow, the Arcadian party became musically inclined. It was the Chat terby custom to sing in the boats as they rowed home through the dusk ; but nobody wanted to go 10 *"], [154, "148 Three Brace of Lovers. home yet, and there was not light enough for another game of rounders. Major Clinton, who was reclining with his back against the oak-bole, when appealed to by the children, drawled out : \" Well, you don't expect me to sing . . . Wha' ? You must call on Miss de Ribeau. A deputation of little girls accordingly waited upon Miss de Ribeau, and was backed by urgent requests from the young men. Delicia, however, with downcast eyes and a slight blush, declined to pleasure them ; Bissett had cured her of all desire to perform in public for the present. But Tom Gawain, having no cousinly critic at hand to make him nervous, was easily persuaded to exhibit his talent. He got out his banjo with alacrity, and, without the least sense of incongruity, began to sing the old Christy, \" Rock Me to Sleep, Mother,\" very tenderly, and to his own accompaniment. Tom's round foolish face, thrown somewhat back \u2014 for he was full of pleasing sentimentalism, \u2014 was a little comedy in itself, though the chorus of young voices at the end of each verse was pretty enough. Nor would he relinquish his instrument upon slight provocation, for his genius was many-sided and his repertory a full one. He might not be good at books and that sort of thing, but he could play and sing, and was resolved that Miss de Ribeau should recognise his"], [155, "Three Brace of Lovers. 149 talent. Indeed, Tom's performance might have gone on indefinitely, but for an inquiry from Mrs. Disbrowe as to whether Mr. Hugo had brought his violin. Mr. Hugo had done so : the little girls raced down in hot haste to fetch it from the canoe. After that, poor Tom Gawain could only grind his teeth and mutter disparaging remarks about the new performer in Miss de Ribeau's ear. Hugo, in deference to his audience, selected well-known airs from the Italian operas, and was amply rewarded for his good-nature. His strains seemed to intensify the pastoral scene \u2014 to express its very heart, to take tough old soldiers back to the period of youth and courtship, and to make the twilight tingle with the gentle melancholy which happy young people can afford to encourage and enjoy. Everyone was pleased and touched, with the exception of honest old Treveldoe, who sat smoking a very dirty pipe and counting his small perch, and haply wishing that the major would give the word to start for home again. The last performance of all was the great suc cess of the evening, for little Maud Calshott, a maiden of sixteen, and too shy to perform in broad daylight, was so far encouraged by the growing dusk as to sing Gounod's \"Ave Maria\" to Mr. Hugo's accompaniment. The child had a sweet"], [156, "Three Brace of Lovers. 150 mezzo-soprano of great promise; and, standing behind them all, with Hugo leaning against the tree beside her, she lost all fear, and so surpassed herself. Then, while the tender melody rose and fell, and the evening air was thrilling with sweet sound, there appeared a single figure advancing from the gate. Some of the party at once recognised the figure as that of Lady Marsh, who had promised her old friend Mrs. Disbrowe to look in upon the party, though detained until this moment, as Tom Gawain had explained. Doubtless she had driven to the farm hard by, and walked on. The new arrival was observed with much interest, for the young widow was a romantic and picturesque figure to look upon, as well as somewhat of a stranger to the neighbourhood. The short period of her wedded life had been mainly spent abroad, and during the year and a half of her widowhood she had only been at Ashlands Court for a week or two at long intervals. People thought she must be a restless woman, or rather hard to please, for Ashlands was a beautiful old place ; while, as for sentiment and that sort of thing, Sir Jekyll was some forty years her senior, and had left her everything \u2014 what more could a woman want ? But the thoughts of our picnickers \u2014 especially just now that they were under the spell of the fresh"], [157, "Three Brace of Lovers. 151 young voice and wailing strings \u2014 were running in no such sordid groove. The lady whom Mrs. Disbrowe stepped forward to greet was tall and graceful, and beautifully fair \u2014 altogether, they thought, a charming, as well as a pathetic-looking, woman. Perhaps she had been greatly attached to that ancient husband of hers, and was still mourning for him ? Yet, if the truth must be told, Lady Marsh had never had more than a good-natured liking for the old gentleman, and though she often dwelt upon his memory with kindly regret, she had now for the moment forgotten that he had ever existed. It happened that the music which was making so much impression upon the others was affecting her still more deeply. The song that filled them with a vague, pleasing sadness did more for her : it took her back to a certain day six months before her wedding, to the twilight of a dim drawing room on just such an evening as this, when she had herself sung Gounod's \"Ave Maria\" \u2014 to someone's accompaniment. That was the last night of her engagement; next morning the lovers had quarrelled and parted, and had never met since. \" What a sweet voice,\" she murmured to her hostess, \" but I only heard half the song. Do you think you could persuade them to give it again ? \" Cheered by the hushed appreciation of her audience, little Maud Calshott was easily persuaded"], [158, "Three Brace of Lovers. 152 to repeat the song. Her accompanist was less willing ; he still leaned against the tree, but seemed doubtful about beginning again. After a pause, however, he pushed his straw hat down over his eyes, and drew out the opening notes of the obligato. \" Is the dusk a sufficient cover ? Does she recognise me?\" \u2014 that was what Hugo was asking himself as he began playing again, \u2014 \" and will she be vexed if I hold aloof, avoiding a meeting for the present ? Curious that she should arrive just in time to hear this song of all others!\" As the song progressed, Hugo perceived under the shade of his hat, that he was recognised. His heart was beating rather quickly : the situation was certainly piquant and peculiar ; he was intensely curious to see what his former betrothed would do next. Lady Marsh turned a shade paler, but perfectly recovered her self-possession before the song was ended. Then she exchanged greetings with the Dodds and one or two others whom she knew, pro ceeding next to bow to Hugo as quietly as though she had met him yesterday ; whereupon, to the amazement of all, he walked forward and silently shook hands with her. Apparently, then, this mysterious person, who puzzled everybody, and could talk of everything from"], [159, "Three Brace of Lovers. 153 high Art to yachting, was a friend of Lady Marsh's ! Verily the man's whole career this afternoon had been a succession of surprises. Soon after this the picnic broke up ; and while the things were being carried down to the boats, Hugo and Lady Marsh melted away into the dusk, not appearing again until every hamper was embarked and some of the party had shoved off. Bissett waited, consumed by curiosity, in the canoe ; but said not a word when Hugo at length rejoined him. Nor did the latter for a time seem inclined either to unbosom himself or to talk upon indifferent topics. Silence reigned between them until they had paddled some distance, and found themselves in a solitary reach of the main river, with its smooth surface jewelled by star-reflections when Hugo began abruptly : \" You guess my story, I suppose, Pyne ? \" \"I guess at it, that's all.\" \" That is the lady to whom I was engaged once upon a time. We parted on a lover's quarrel ; and which of us was most to blame I neither know nor care \u2014 for it's all the same now.\" \" It is very interesting,\" said Bissett, sympatheti cally. \"And now, I suppose, you are going to take up the threads of the old romance again ?\" \"No, my good fellow, no,\" retorted the other"], [160, "Three Brace of Lovers. 154 fretfully, \" for the fact is \u2014 we 've quarrelled again already !\" This announcement so astonished Bissett that he drew in his paddle to think about it. For the first time he began to realise fully what he had hitherto only surmised vaguely ; viz., that beneath Hugo's good-natured, whimsical surface there lurked certain veins of downright wicked perversity, scarcely to be distinguished from that of a spoiled child."], [161, "Three Brace of Lovers. 155 CHAPTER IX. NE morning, about a fortnight after the picnic at \"The Gravels,\" old Hester came in to her mistress to announce the arrival of Major Clinton. It was barely ten o'clock, and Mrs. Pyne was dusting the nicknacks in the drawing room, as was her usual custom of a morning; equally as a matter of course, she was thinking of her son as she moved round the room taking up one little ornament after another. Hester's announcement startled her somewhat, for the major's roan cob and smart little groom seldom made their appearance in the lane before noon, his ordinary rule being to drive straight to the Club, and work steadily through the morning papers, before entering upon the gentle labours of the day. But Mrs. Pyne never made a stranger of the major, who was her general adviser as well as staunch old friend. He was shown in to her at once. \" Well, Mrs. Pyne, how are you ? \" he inquired, in his rich, lazy voice. \" May I interrupt your house hold duties for a few minutes ? I want to have a"], [162, "Three Brace os Lovers. 156 little business talk with you ; but don't be alarmed ! Wha' . . . ?\" If there be a phrase better calculated to scare an anxious mother than another, it is that fear some \"don't be alarmed ! \" The delicate old face paled at once ; the mother's heart flew straightway to Beechgrove. Was poor Bissett in trouble with those dreadful young men ? Had he quarrelled with Mr. Mulliner ? Had he \"It's about your niece; the precious boy's all right,\" said the major, quite quickly for him, and with the old twinkle coming into his eyes. Mrs. Pyne recovered at once. The strange gravity of her old friend's look had frightened her even more than his words. \"I suppose she is still at Chesning?\" he proceeded, sinking into the deepest chair avail able. Yes, Delicia was still at Chesning Grange ; indeed, the Dodd family had been quite wrapped up in her lately. They had called upon Mrs. Pyne the very day after the picnic ; and, the reaction after yesterday's meekness having naturally set in rather strongly, they had sat in the tiny drawing-room, patronising Mrs. Pyne with great success. That gentle little woman had been somewhat stiff and distant, for her, but could make no head against them. Miss"], [163, "Three Brace of Lovers. 157 Dodd overflowed with complacent kindness, carried off Delicia at the end of the visit, and drove her back again the next morning. After that, the Grange dog-cart had come spinning down the lane almost every day, and Mrs. Pyne had to submit to frequent presents of fruit and flowers, to say nothing of other florid attentions, from people who had hitherto ignored her existence. Fortunately, his young lord ship of Beechgrove knew nothing of these, or sick pride must have worked him into a fever. But his mother had to put up with a good deal, in order not to stand in the way of Delicia's opportunities of excitement and change ; though, as a set-off against her personal discomforts, she found old Hester's temper and spirits always the better for the occa sional absence of her niece. \"Well, I don't like this constant visiting at the Grange,\" grumbled Major Clinton. \" Don't you see their little game, eh ?\" \" I must say they are very civil and kind to Delicia, and the frequent change does her good.\" \" Don't you see that they mean to capture her for their brother Harry ? Old Dodd, for all his talk about money, would give his head to marry his son to a peer's daughter, rich or poor.\" \" I daresay they are as worldly as other people,\" said Mrs. Pyne, rather fretfully, \" but how can I help that ? what can I do ? \""], [164, "158 Three Brace of Lovers. \" Checkmate them by a little management, that's what you can do ! \" \" I don't see how ; besides, I hate all plots and schemes, and will have nothing to do with them. It seems to be all scheming now. In my young days people used to fall in love \" \"So they do still. Wha-a-a' . . . ?\" chuckled the major. \"That's just the mischief of it ! But look here, Mrs. Pyne, I want to speak to you about this man Hugo \u2014 do you know who he really is ?\" \" Perfectly well.\" \" Indeed ? How in the world did you come to make the discovery ? \" \" His mother, when Miss Treveldoe, lived for a long time in our part of the country ; I have known her people, more or less, all my life. I have not seen this Mr. Hugo, as he calls himself, since he left Eton ; but I half recognised him upon first meeting him in the High Street, and then the mention of Col. Treveldoe's name settled the point. As a boy, he was an odd, whimsical fellow, and a great anxiety to his mother. No one quite knew how he would turn out. At one time, while in Germany, he threatened to give up books and take to music, like a professional ; then to throw up both, and betake himself to African exploration. They only got him into the army by taking advantage of a passing"], [165, "Three Brace of Lovers. 159 whim ; but now his oddity has taken a turn of which I strongly disapprove.\" \" You mean his living down here incog., eh ?\" \" Yes. I call it living under false pretences. What right has he to give himself out as a nobody ? How does his conduct differ from that of one who falsely pretends to be a somebody ? To my mind, the one is as truly a deceiver as the other.\" Major Clinton smiled with the tolerant superi ority of a man of the world, emitting a vague \"Wha' . . . ?\" which might mean anything, then resumed with a surprisingly brisk air : \" At any rate, the man is a most eligible parti. You would rather see Delicia engaged to him than to young Harry Dodd, eh ?\" \" Delicia is not yet eighteen. I don't see why we should try to force her upon anyone ; in fact, I will have no hand in any such arrange ment.\" At this point the big major pulled at his wisp of moustache rather angrily, for him. He had always liked women, and stood up for them ; yet some member of the sex or other was always pulling him up short with some such \"confounded nonsense \" as this. Mrs. Pyne, too, he had always considered singularly reasonable \u2014 for a woman ; yet here she was now flying in the face of common sense, like any romantic young bread-and-butter miss ! There was"], [166, "160 Three Brace of Lovers. an artful gleam in the major's eye, however, suggestive of a trump card or two still in hand. \" Has it ever occurred to you,\" he asked, with a shade of sarcasm in his tone, \" that the presence of this pretty cousin is a standing menace to the peace of our high-and-mighty young lordship ?\" Now Mrs. Pyne resented even good-natured chaff in connection with her beloved son. He was to her a Chevalier Bayard, about whom no one should even think jestingly. Moreover, this move of the wily old soldier was in other respects a false one. His mother quite appreciated Bissett's danger, and her anxiety on this head had rather increased lately. He had been absent from home now for two or three Saturdays ; a bad symptom, which looked as though he smelt danger, and, as a by no means weak young man, meant to avoid it. That a little weakness for his cousin should follow upon his first rather extravagant dislike of her was, Mrs. Pyne thought, both natural and pro bable. She would rather have seen Bissett begin with a little cousinly liking, such as would be likely to issue in a brother-and-sister friendship, rather than anything more serious. As it was, were Delicia to be suddenly recalled to the wing of Aunt Long hurst, it would be somewhat of a relief, though Mrs. Pyne was now beginning to have a real liking for her niece. But to deliberately thwart her son's fancy, if"], [167, "Three Brace of Lovers. 161 he had one, by throwing Delicia in another man's way, was quite another thing. She was too loyal to go against him even for his own happiness. Yet yet the situation was certainly full of peril. Bissett had cut away the ground from under his own feet : a successful career was morally impossible to him from the moment of his final rejection of Sir Bissett's assistance. If only Lady Pyne had pre sented Sir Bissett with twin daughters instead of sons ! She could not help harbouring the wish for just a moment, though hitherto she had rejoiced that the barrier between Bissett and the title and entailed estate was a strong one ; for, had his cousins been sickly young men, her boy might have been tantalised with possibilities all his life. Major Clinton, observing her shrewdly, soon perceived that he could not hope for an ally in Bissett's mother, though his disappointment was tempered by the expectation of, in that case, having all the fun of the intrigue to himeslf. For he was not only resolved that Chesning should not capture the charming Princess of Chatterby, but confident in his capacity for outman\u0153uvring the whole Hybrid faction arrayed against her. \" At any rate,\" he said, as he rose to depart, \"you won't interfere with me, eh, Mrs. Pyne? You won't hinder your niece from coming to dine with us now and then, and meeting the n"], [168, "162 Three Brace of Lovers. photographer ? You 're not so unreasonable as that? Wha' . . . ?\" \" I shall take no steps whatever, make no move one way or the other; I don't believe in match making.\" \" And you a woman? Oh, come, Mrs. Pyne ! Wha-a-a-a' . . . ?\" And so the old fellow chuckled his way out into the hall, leaving Mrs. Pyne to fret and harass her self as became an anxious mother. The major's next move was to drive to the Club and despatch a civil note to Hugo, asking him to dinner at an early date. Then he joined a group of four or five other old soldiers and a couple of parsons, who were all very busy doing nothing. With them he discussed the prospects of the cricket week, and other news of the town, until, having exhausted their topics, they fell to lounging at the open window and watching the gently simmering traffic of the High Street. But the other five or six were at best mere amateur loungers \u2014 men with some talent for idleness, but no real genius. They were fain to drop off after a time, with a view to promenading the little street, and seeming to do a little shopping, so as to return home presently with a parcel or two, and a comfortable sense of having done a morning's work. The major alone was a real artist in indolence, who never found time hang"], [169, "Three Brace of Lovers. 163 heavily, so that he had peace, and a chair decently cushioned. After half-an-hour of solitary meditation, how ever, Major Clinton's serenity was disturbed by the recollection of an engagement. He had this morning received a letter from Col. Treveldoe, entreating him to come to lunch without fail, and hinting at some serious trouble, about which his advice was urgently needed. \"Confounded nuisance!\" he muttered. \"A man never gets a quiet morning here without finding himself . . . Wha' . . . ?\" He arose with a deep sigh, and strolled away to the Falcon Hotel, where his trap was always put up. Col. Treveldoe's cottage stood a long way from the main road, at the end of a tiresome long lane. The drive thither was a dull one, too, through the interminable hop-gardens of the river valley. Major Clinton had to start in haste, and drove along in rather a depressed mood, with clouds of dust half blinding him, and the deep wooded vale of Chesning looking tantalisingly cool and pleasant away to his right. But his good-nature was rewarded by a hearty welcome at the cottage. \" Awfully glad to see you, old fellow !\" exclaimed Col. Treveldoe ; \" I quite hoped you would come. Your man will put up at the Dolphin, as usual, I n *"], [170, "Three Brace of Lovers. 164 suppose? Come and have a look at my kidney beans while I change this gardening coat.\" The colonel looked round with some pride at his little garden. Certainly its soil must have been excellent, for a good many things had come up in spite of him. A stalwart row of kidney-beans already made an effective shade for his little sitting room ; and his potato-rows were a standing proof that energy, even divorced from skill, goes for some thing. Major Clinton took a reluctant step or two, stared hard at the end cabbage of a row, then summed it all up in one comprehensive \" Wha' . . . ? \" ? \" His interest in the garden was thereupon exhausted. \"Where's Hugo to-day?\" he asked, after a decent pause. \" Oh, he's away at Winkleigh with his new bosom-friend, Pyne \u2014 and a good riddance I find him. He has taken to grumbling lately, confound him ! \u2014 vows he's bored to death here, and that sort of thing, yet he won't go. I keep telling him to clear out, yet he hangs on to me like an Old Man of the Sea. However, he's a good caterer, I must say. What do you think he runs our little mess for?\" The major found this question as little interesting as that of the garden, but hazarded a guess, just to save trouble."], [171, "Three Brace of Lovers. 165 \" For less than half that !\" cried old Treveldoe, triumphantly. \" Now what do you think ? \" The visitor expressed a little decent astonishment ; then told the colonel that he thought of taking Hugo in hand, with a view to making the neighbourhood more interesting to him. \" Well, I wish you 'd either do that, or pack him straight off to town \u2014 the latter for choice. But it's high time for lunch, Clinton \u2014 let us adjourn to the cottage.\" During the meal the honest colonel began to unbosom himself concerning the trouble at which his note had hinted, the unfolding of which will give us an opportunity of viewing him in a new light. Hitherto we have seen him as an ardent perch fisherman, and a simple unpretending man, with a hearty appetite and nothing much to say for him self; but in the paternal relation, his strong point, we have not had a glimpse at the old soldier. He was, in truth, if a commonplace man, by no means a commonplace father. For years he had pinched and screwed to get his son Tom \u2014 who had inherited his father's intellect together with his worth \u2014 through a troubled sea of military crammers to the haven of the Indian Staff Corps, and had done it successfully. Now, as we know, he was wearing an economical straight-waistcoat for the sake of his daughter Julia."], [172, "166 Three Brace of Lovers. It was about Julia that he now wished to consult his friend Clinton. \" You know why I 'm here,\" he began, \" and all about my plans in general ? Well, everything has gone pretty smoothly up till now; the cottage scheme has answered very well on the whole. And while I 've been saving money, Julia has left school and begun her round of visits; nor has she as yet the ghost of an idea that I 'm slumming it in a veritable cottage, but thinks I live in a snug little country house. Well, I had hoped to keep up the fiction for another year \u2014 and now, by Jove, she 's about to come down upon me like an avalanche ! \" \" Why, what 's the matter now ? ' \" Instead of going northwards next, as had been arranged, behold! she's coming here \u2014 to Chesning \u2014 to stay with a schoolfellow, one of the younger Dodd girls. And you know what fools women are. The moment she discovers my little fraud, she'll insist upon coming here to share my poverty, forsooth ! Then I suppose she '11 lose all her chances, and fall out of Society altogether, which is a shocking thing for a young girl like that. The situation 's tragic, by Jove, downright tragic !\" But the worst of confiding one's seeming tragadies to one of the sterner sex is, that he is nearly sure to view them in the light of farcical"], [173, "Three Brace of Lovers. 167 comedies. Thus Major Clinton's sympathies took the form of a joyous rumble of laughter : \" Ho-ho ! I should like to see the girl's face when she finds you out, old fox !

I wish you 'd be reasonable.\" \"Why, look here, Treveldoe, you've always boasted of having Julia in such good discipline ; so why not put your veto on this visit ? \" \" You don't understand, Clinton,\" said the colonel, solemnly shaking his head. \" You're not a father yourself, so you can't understand. Ju would be miserable were she once to see me pigging it here, like a gardener ! \" \" You know there 's a young Dodd, heir to about thirty thousand a year ; perhaps he '11 fall in love with her ? \" suggested the major, with a chuckle. \"Gadzooks!\" cried the other testily. \"I wouldn't have her marry into that family of trades men for all I 'm worth.

Young Dodd ? Psha ! she wouldn't look at him ! \" \" Comic world, to be sure,\" reflected the major. \" I suppose old Dodd, from his point of view, would scoff as loudly at Julia ! How much would he care for a hundred yards or so of Cornish pedigree, with nothing-a-year to gild it ?\" \" But what am I to do ? \" reiterated Col. Tre veldoe, getting up, knife and fork in hand, and walking restlessly to and fro. \" Does Julia know your address ?\" \"No, no; I'm too old a bird to let that out. She knows I 'm somewhere in this county, not very far from town, and thinks I'm constantly running to and fro ; so I 've made her direct all her letters to the Club, and always have my own posted there too.\" \" Well done, old boy !

Ah! you don't know what it is, Clinton, to have \" \" Don't be doleful, old boy!

T so chanced that nearly all the good folks whose acquaintance we have made were troubled about this time, by private griefs of more or less depth ; a kind of epidemic of worries, senti- mental and other, for which there is no recognised treatment, had fallen upon the Chatterby district. There was Mrs. Pyne, as we have seen, hovering between loyalty to her son's supposed desires and fears for his happiness, harassed the while by the somewhat unwelcome blandishments of a troupe of Miss Dodds ; there was Colonel Treveldoe palpitating with anxiety as to Julia's possible discovery of his tortuous conduct ; and even Chesning, breathing its county atmosphere, shut off from the world in its happy valley brimful of oak-woods, did not escape the prevailing low-fever of mental disturbance. Major Clinton had, indeed, correctly gauged the course of Chesning Grange's present ambition : the Dodds were, in sober earnest, giving their energies to the establishment of a sentimental understanding between Miss de Ribeau and the only son of their house \u2014 and so far, without much success. Miss de Ribeau was willing enough to spend a"], [178, "Three Brace of Lovers. 172 week or so at the Grange and ride about the country with Mr. Harry and the girls ; but, as far as four anxious and sharp-sighted women could perceive, remained perfectly heart-whole ; while, as for Harry himself \u2014 an easy-going, unaffected young fellow who never could be got to see eye to eye with his people \u2014 Delicia might as well have been some plain and peevish old maid, for any impression she appeared to make upon him. Master Harry had, in fact, been a stumbling block to his people for some years. He was tire somely free from the family ambition ; his father could make nothing of him, since he flatly declined to go into the City, or in any way assist in piling up the family gold-heap. There had been a stormy domestic scene on the occasion of that refusal, Mr. Dodd's condition being so explosive that his daughters trembled through the day, and half his servants thought fit to give notice. Harry had offered to farm either in this country or one of the colonies, declaring himself unfit for any other kind of work ; and when the suggestion only made his father swear the louder, had gone calmly on his way, riding hard and straight through the hunting season, and pottering through the summer as best he might. This cool conduct had taught Harry's family a lesson ; they were now trying the gently persuasive method with him. Mr. Dodd talked, over his claret,"], [179, "Three Brace of Lovers. 173 of his fatherly yearning to see Harry married and happily settled for life, and never hinted at the City ; while the Miss Dodds praised Delicia to her face, as well as behind her back, until honest Harry was sick of the very sound of her name. Meanwhile, a fine head of jealousy was working up among their neighbours, the Gawains. They also wished to make much of Miss de Ribeau, and were hardly so much as asked to meet her. Their brothers, going up to the City every day, never got a chance of an innings with Delicia ; she was monopo lised by those Dodds, \u2014 railed off, fenced in, guarded, as it were, by female keepers. Miss de Ribeau, as it happened, was not at all offended with Harry Dodd for his inability to fall in love with her ; the truth being that she already found herself entangled in such an undergrowth of flirtations, more or less serious, that she could not see her way at all clearly just at present. Roughly speaking, all the young 'Varsity men about Chatterby, as well as any stray subalterns who chanced to be home on short leave about this time, were no better than her slaves. About this youthful crowd, it is true, she troubled herself very little; but there were older victims also, such as curates, masters of the big school and others \u2014 and some of these cases were rather serious, as was evidenced by the condition of the Chesning road of a Sunday morning during her"], [180, "Three Brace of Lovers. 174 visit to the Grange. That dusty and somewhat dull length of highway, was between ten-thirty and eleven o'clock, dotted with deserters from the parish church of Chatterby, all bound for that of Chesning. Delicia told over a list of them as she settled herself down for the sermon, and afterwards passed no less than three considerable groups of these soupirants between the church door and the lodge gates of the Grange. Well, let them sigh \u2014 it would do them no harm ; she was perfectly easy in her conscience about every one of them. But there was one person about whom she was beginning to feel a twinge or two \u2014 that is to say, her cousin Bissett. For some weeks she had been laying herself out to add him to her list ; and it must be admitted, she now frankly regretted the attempt. Things were going wrong with Bissett at Beech grove, as she knew from one or two hints he had dropped lately, and his position was one of great anxiety : it would have been kinder to leave him free to confront his existing troubles, without adding to them. Besides, the endeavour to capture her cousin was not altogether a safe pastime from her own point of view ; perhaps she had burned just the tips of her own fingers a little, while intending only to scorch his \u2014 which, considering his hopeless prospects, was ridiculous enough."], [181, "Three Brace of Lovers. 175 Happily, however, she had latterly been able to divert her mind with a perfectly fresh, new, and interesting Prince Charming \u2014 the mysterious Mr. Hugo had openly joined the ranks of her admirers. The acquisition of this new subject was certainly a little epoch in Delicia's career. Here was no enamoured fledgling, but a man of fashion, travelled and cultured \u2014 a personage, indeed, as Major Clinton had several times hinted. He must have taken a fancy to her at the picnic, for his attentions began to take definite shape soon afterwards. That he might be only amusing himself with her, or playing at flirtation for the express purpose of vexing some- one else, never occurred to Delicia, blest as she was with a power of vanity sufficient to make anyone short-sighted. She had met him several times at Major Clinton's, and, after making Mrs. Pyne's acquaintance, he had called more than once at the villa ; indeed, he seemed to lose no opportunity of being in Miss de Ribeau's company. It was Hugo's way thus to overdo every new pastime while the freshness lasted ; but naturally Delicia knew nothing of his whims and peculiarities. She was enjoying the situation heartily, and was not a little amused at the thought of how Bissett's friend, all unknown to himself, was quietly making play during his absence at Beechgrove. In fact, Bissett's continued avoid ance of her \u2014 for he was strong enough to keep away"], [182, "176 Three Brace of Lovers. a good deal, though not altogether \u2014 certainly piqued her into giving more serious attention to Hugo than she might otherwise have done. Yet, despite her keen relish of all the admiration she was receiving, Delicia too was at bottom uneasy in her mind ; for towards the only eligible on her list she felt at present no personal leaning, while as for Bissett Pyne, the most hopeless detrimental of the bunch, she liked him better than was altogether advisable. But a far greater sufferer from the prevailing epidemic of anxiety than any of those just mentioned was Lady Marsh. She knew nothing of the little comedy now being played upon the Chatterby boards, with Delicia, Hugo, and Bissett in the principal roles ; but she was painfully conscious that the man who had in old days caused her so much tribulation, and who had lately chanced across her path again so unexpectedly, still possessed the key of her peace and happiness. This discovery stung her pride and depressed her spirits not a little. Upon the breakage of her engagement she had set herself firmly to forget Hugo, and had quite hoped to succeed in doing so. After a short interval she had accepted her old friend and admirer, Sir Jekyll Marsh, partly perhaps out of pique, but mainly from a sense of duty to her family, which was rich in marriageable daughters, though in nothing else. Then, as a woman of high rectitude, as well as of a"], [183, "Three Brace of Lovers. 177 sensitive, anxious temperament, she had striven to do her duty by her husband to the utmost limit of her powers. Old Sir Jekyll, however, doted upon her, and she had nothing beyond amiable regard to bestow upon him in return, which vexed her sorely. She resolved, nevertheless, to be a devoted wife, and sedulously nursed her regard for him, hoping earnestly for better things to follow later. Unfortunately, there was no time to carry through this good resolution, for, three months after the wedding, Sir Jekyll died after a short illness, praising and blessing his bride with his eyes long after he had lost the power of speech. After her husband's death, Constance Marsh felt that she had lost an old friend, whom she was yet but just learning to know, and for whom she had not done half enough. She had none of the grief proper to a disconsolate widow, and was ashamed at having to pose as such before the world. Also, she was grieved and ashamed at coming in for his great possessions on such slight grounds, as it were \u2014 a feeling significant enough of the quality of her mind and heart. Later on there came stealing back, in spite of her, the old hope and longing ; nor did there seem anything to prevent its fulfilment as soon as a decent period of mourning should have elapsed. Hugo, she knew, had long ago regretted the foolish freak which 12"], [184, "Three Brace of Lovers. 178 had separated the lovers ; and his people had always looked upon her as the woman above all others suited for the steadying of that troublesome philosopher, their eldest son. Yet it was this very desire on the part of his relations, had she but known it, which kept Hugo from coming forward to make amends for his former folly ; the truth being that they had over done the thing from sheer anxiety, expressing their wishes so insistently as to bring on a sharp attack of his old perversity. Thus, instead of renewing the old affair, as he would certainly have done if left to himself, he had gone off to Norway salmon-fishing, and had continued to avoid the young widow ever since. He flatly declined to pursue his old love before the hungry gaze of all his friends ; and, in short, pronounced the situation altogether too crude and commonplace to be supportable. But, about the time when they had all given up the case as hopeless, came the interview with Colonel Treveldoe at the Club, which had suggested an opening for eluding all his friends, and at the same time reconnoitring Constance Marsh's neighbourhood without committing himself to any definite step. This plan, he thought, had much to recommend it ; and fitted well with his mood, as being indefinite, romantic, and suggestive of pleasing riverside indo lence. The situation would be freed from all its crudity at a stroke ; the renewal of the old tie, were"], [185, "Three Brace of Lovers. 179 it to take place, would now be on the lines of a veritable idyll. Nevertheless the projected idyll had, as we know, merged into farce at its very commencement \u2014 he had quarrelled again with Constance at their first meet ing, leaving her to return, crushed and bewildered, to the entertainment of a houseful of guests at Ashlands. But, knowing nothing of his philanderings with the Princess of Chatterby, Constance lived in daily expectation of some penitent message from Hugo. Every morning she woke up buoyed with this hope, but as the days passed it grew steadily feebler. Hugo never appeared, never sent line or message \u2014 he was otherwise engaged just at present. Two or three weeks went slowly by, and her guests departed ; Constance Marsh was left to wear through the days in solitude, and Ashlands Court became silent and mournful as Mariana's Grange. Bissett Pyne, however, the last person upon our list of unfortunates, was perhaps even more to be pitied than the hardly-used mistress of Ashlands ; for, in addition to the sentimental question, the more urgent one of bread-and-butter was now beginning to press upon him. The facts of the case were simple enough, and the principal cause of his trouble was the high spirit of his sometime friend and comrade, McLachlan. 12"], [186, "Three Brace of Lovers. 180 It happened that a Line Examination, for which about half the Beechgrove establishment, including McLachlan himself (if sober enough), were to present themselves as candidates, was coming off in the course of a week or two. All Mulliner's was bestir ring itself accordingly ; cricket languished, the scholastic treadmill was at work day and night. Now, the severity of this state of things was ill suited to a man of McLachlan's spirit : for three days he drooped ; on the fourth, he indulged in so prolonged a luncheon as to be in danger of another sunstroke. The betting at Beechgrove was now five to two against his being \" brought to the post sober,\" as they phrased it. In consequence of this, Mr. Mulliner's temper grew somewhat fretful, and he naturally fell to blaming his tutors. Old Peacocke had a hard time of it ; even Bissett came in for a side stroke or two, which pleased his mightiness but ill. Indeed, he began to dislike his lot a shade more heartily \u2014 though this had seemed impossible \u2014 than heretofore. And worse was coming. For just at this period McLachlan was so fre quently at \" The Anglers' \" as hardly ever to be quite sober after midday ; and to have him coming into lecture fresh from that haunt of pleasure was a sore trial to a conscientious tutor. Old Peacocke would laugh when Mac put in an appearance half an hour late, looking dazed and maudlin ; but Bissett fretted"], [187, "Three Brace of Lovers. 181 himself into fiddlestrings about anything of this sort. He resolved to have a battle royal with his friend McLachlan at an early opportunity. Unfortunately, circumstances so shaped them selves as to bring about this battle at a time when Bissett was already in a state of deep dejection. It has already been hinted that he was a member of that forlorn band, the literary aspirants. Hugo had ere now detected dangerous symptoms in his friend, and had solemnly warned him to shake him self free of the fatal vice of scribbling. \"The Editor regrets,\" etc. \u2014 he had read out the well-known formula from a piece of notepaper casually discovered in Bissett's room, and taking that as his text, had thereupon delivered a homily. \" Editors will go on regretting,\" he said, \"till your hair 's grey and your heart broken. I know many editors ; they are mere targets, upon which literary aspirants pour bullets all day, at all ranges. Also I know, roughly speaking; about half-a-million of literary aspirants \u2014 all honourable men, all miser able dogs. Do you see that fine elm in the doctor's garden over there ? There are more scribblers in London than leaves on that tree. Have nothing to do with that dolorous race, Bissett, as long as there's a single heap of stones to be broken by any roadside in these Islands !\" But Bissett was a stubborn fellow, and kept"], [188, "182 Three Brace of Lovers. banging away at the editor-targets with all his might, perhaps recollecting the old adage of Sir Thomas More : \" He that shoteth oft, at last shal hit the mark.\" It was foolish, almost wicked, after what he had heard, but then his only chance of ever shaking off the tutorial harness lay in the direction of this evil practice. He continued to hope some times, and to burn the midnight oil even when he had no hope. During the last year, moreover, he had carried the vicious practice to its extreme limit \u2014 he had written a novel. No one knew of it, except Delicia ; he had done this thing in secret, as became such criminal work. He had put into the novel as much of his eager young heart and brain as the strain of tutoring had left intact, and sent it off through the village post-office ; and it need hardly be added that the question of Cousin Delicia was somehow mixed up with that of the success of his book. In about three weeks, during which time his romantic hopes would multiply and thicken in spite of him, the great work was re-delivered to him by the village postman. Thus, to his bulky collection of editors' polite regrets he added those of a pub lisher ; and went over to his lecture-room, feeling that it must now be his prison for life. The remainder of his existence must be spent in wrestling with idle young men ; his dream of carving out a career for"], [189, "Three Brace of Lovers. 183 himself was evidently a piece of childish folly, and the sooner it could be put aside the better. As for Cousin Delicia, who had seemed to be almost in arm's length of him when viewed through the tele scope of youthful hope, she was now, as seen with the naked eye, a mere speck vanishing on the horizon. The Greek class found their tutor rather tame spirited that morning, and waxed somewhat rowdy accordingly, in place of being simply idle. As a rule, Bissett kept them in order, though no man living could make them work ; but to-day the power of his will was slackened. Moreover, as McLachlan gave a party at \"The Anglers',\" the afternoon class was as fresh as a lively young colt. Bissett was still seemingly tame, but inwardly brooding, and nursing thoughts of revenge. In the evening, as being a tutor of all work, though in the main classical, he took a Euclid class. But between work and worry his brain was in an addled condition, and, to relieve the pressure, he gave them an examination-paper in place of ex pounding diagrams on the black-board. While they scribbled pretty zealously \u2014 for some of them really meant to pass \u2014 the tutor endeavoured to make his mind a blank, and so allow it to regain its balance. But he couldn't stop thinking ; dis appointment and geometry began to mix themselves"], [190, "184 Three Brace of Lovers. up into a strange sort of amalgam, something like a proposition in Euclid. \" Leave off thinking, and give me a little peace,\" said he to his brain. \" It is required to prove that the literary aspirant is a veritable patriot,\" his brain retorted immediately. \" Now, it is conceded by Postulate xxv. that a man who gives either health or money to his country without hope of reward is a patriot ; but the literary aspirant pours out money upon postage-stamps, thus enriching his country's revenue, and does so with out any hope of return whatsoever. And it has already been proved (Euc. xvii, 18) that his health suffers in the process ; therefore he gives his health and money gratuitously for the enrichment of his country. Wherefore the literary aspirant is,\" etc., etc. Q.E.D. From the above proposition it is manifest \" that a fool is a person of some real use in the world.\" For it has already been shown the literary aspirant is a patriot ; and by a former proposition it was proved that a patriot is a person of real use ; and by Axiom i. the literary aspirant is a fool \u2014 therefore \" a fool is a person,\" etc., etc. Q.E.D. For some half-hour his brain went ploughing through such nonsense as this, while the goading of irritated nerves became well-nigh insupportable. The stoicism upon which he justly prided himself"], [191, "Three Brace of Lovers. 185 seemed likely to give way at last ; he was overworn and overworked, as well as sore with disappoint- ment. To him, thus vexed McLachlan and Tom drunk. and driven, there entered Gawain, both somewhat They came straight from the bar of \" The Anglers',\" emerging slowly from the dim passage into the lamp-lit lecture-room, just half-an-hour late. For the moment \u2014 and perhaps for the first time in his career, for he was far too young to have achieved the calm of despair which had distinguished old Peacocke for years \u2014 our harassed tutor was minded to play the coward, and content himself with just saying : \" You 're late, both of you ! I wish you would come in decent time, There's your Euclid paper.\" But Pyne's conscience was too active to permit of his accepting such a loophole. The yellow light fell upon Mac's face, shining and oily-looking from the effect of many luncheons, upon his boozy eyes and dishevelled hair ; and upon Tom Gawain's depre cating, idiotic smile, and shrinking figure. With a leap of hot blood to his face, Bissett started to his feet, crying sharply : \" You're drunk, both of you ! The pens ceased scratching ; a ghastly kind of silence fell upon the room. \"That's a lie!\" whispered McLachlan, pale and"], [192, "186 Three Brace of Lovers. almost voiceless with fury. \" That's a lie\u2014 I'm not drunk!\" Tom Gawain leaned against the door-jamb, cowed and trembling; McLachlan advanced a few steps, as though about to strike the tutor who had so often befriended him. But nothing tends to cool a man's fury better than the kind of look with which he was now encountered. Pyne seemed, not anxious or frightened, but exultant : his blood was boiling ; he was thirsting for blows like any savage. Had McLachlan got within arm's length of him, the Euclid class would have probably been treated to a stand-up fight \u2014 and tutor and pupil must have left the establishment next morning. But McLachlan paused ; for a second or two they glared at one another in silence\u2014 then the tutor pointed to the door, and the pupil turned to the class, more sober at this moment than he had been for many days. \" I call you men to witness,\" he said, \" that I'm not drunk ; and, by God, I '11 make him answer for this false accusation ! \" \"Leave my room!\" said Bissett, steadying his voice by a great effort of will, and thrusting both hands into his pockets to keep them quiet. \" I shall not receive either of you again without an ample apology for this night's work.\" Two or three men gathered round McLachlan,"], [193, "Three Brace of Lovers. 187 muttering and whispering. Certainly they would stand by and back him ; he was no more drunk than they were. Let him make it hot for Pyne \u2014 they would stand by him ; but let him go now, and see about punishing the tutor to-morrow. Bissett had done what seemed to him his duty, and it was clear that he would be made to suffer for it. These men ranged themselves against him, as against a natural enemy ; these men, whose friend and comrade he was during play-time, with whom he was cricketing, boating or riding at one hour of the day, and whose tutor he had to become the next. He had to instruct and keep them in order, with none of the ordinary powers of a schoolmaster to help him ; yet in the treatment of friend and foe alike he had been just as an Aristides. He had got more work out of them, in their own interest, than any other master in the place ; he had slaved for them good-naturedly in hours and out of hours, and they now turned upon him as naturally and inevitably as though he were the best-hated tutor in Beech grove. Yet one thing Pyne had secured \u2014 their respect ; but for which, his class must now have been in open mutiny. As it was, the men who had gathered round McLachlan returned quietly to their seats ; while Mac himself, with a glance of deadly spite at"], [194, "188 Three Brace of Lovers. the tutor who had outraged him so, stalked out of the room, and was seen no more that evening. Tom Gawain had ere this tottered away into the passage, the brief scene was over for the present, though Bissett was well assured that the trouble was only half begun."], [195, "Three Brace of Lovers. 189 CHAPTER XI. EXT morning found Bissett with his w b\u00ab^ ill blood not much cooled, and his sense EU^^SiO) of antagonism to the world in general *2*l||pP<- rather increased than lessened. The atmosphere of the breakfast-room at Beechgrove was ominous, and highly suggestive of troubles to come ; and Bissett heard young men greeting one another in the passage outside with such humorous remarks as : \"You're drunk; I won't have you here in this state \u2014 leave my room at once, sir ! \" It was evident that his little affair was the talk of the place, and looked upon as rather a good joke by all those not concerned in its possible issue. McLachlan did not appear at breakfast ; but, on returning to his cottage quarters, Bissett found him strolling up and down with Tom Gawain, seemingly with the intention of confronting himself. Mac, as the stronger man, had of course taken the lead and settled upon the plan of action to be followed. Tom Gawain was merely clinging to the other's skirts, at bottom very unwilling to play the man of spirit, but rather yearning to make it up with Pyne and return to his old allegiance. Nor"], [196, "Three Brace of Lovers. 190 was Mac quite easy in his conscience, which insinu ated that Pyne had only done his duty. On the other hand, pride was smarting and insisting upon his right to an apology, and so far had the best of it that his present business was the putting forward of an ultimatum. Looking rather pale and dissipated, but full of resolution, with his long face showing its freckles rather distinctly and his light-blue eyes full of smouldering wrath, McLachlan stepped forward to deliver his statement. He remarked briefly that if Mr. Pyne were willing to apologise for his unjustifiable accusation, he and Gawain would carry the matter no further ; but if not Bissett stopped the speaker at this point ; his answer came out in one brief spurt, having in it more pith than propriety : \"I'll see you d\u2014d first, McLachlan ! \" Thereupon the pair withdrew, and marched straight off to Beechgrove, doubtless bound for Mr. Mulliner's study. Bissett adjourned to his Greek class, and some hours of deceitful calm ensued. Just before luncheon, Bissett received the note which he had been expecting all the morning ; a note somewhat curt, but perfectly polite, inviting his presence in the study."], [197, "Three Brace of Lovers. 191 Mr. Mulliner was, in fact, in a somewhat difficult position. With any other of his tutors his course would have been plain enough : a telegram to his agents would have brought a substitute from town by an afternoon train. For as a Hobbist pure and simple, whose chief rule of life was that of a prudent selfishness, the rights or wrongs of the matter would not have concerned him seriously. Not that he was without a moral code by any means : for outside his own interests, Mr. Mulliner was quite as just and considerate as most men; but within the domain of business, he never allowed sentiment or ethics, or indeed anything but plain common sense, to enter. In the city of London, and elsewhere upon the habitable globe, there might perchance be found here and there men of precisely similar views. But Pyne was not an ordinary tutor; he was clever and conscientious ; hitherto he had been much looked up to by the establishment generally. He certainly had a knack with the men. He had played that difficult double part of tutor-in-work and comrade-in-play more successfully than nine masters out of ten who had served Mr. Mulliner. It would not be easy to replace him at all, much less at a moment's notice. It was this consideration that made the conjuncture an awkward one. Thus the head of the establishment's manner in"], [198, "Three Brace of Lovers. 192 receiving Bissett was, if it may be said without dis respect, a kind of compost produced by the mingling of various sentiments and interests. He was glad to see Pyne : this matter was rather serious, \u2014 let him take a seat, and talk the difficulty over in a friendly and rational spirit ; it was serious, but he trusted some solution would offer itself. In the first place, Mr. Mulliner wished to hear no details of the case ; details only confused an issue \u2014 he liked to look at a thing broadly. Bissett had no remark to make at this point. He knew that one side had already been heard, details and all, as also that the head of the establishment was perfectly aware of McLachlan's semi-inebriate condition throughout the last week ; but he had no intention of making a speech in his defence. \" You see, Pyne, my plan in a case of this sort is, to let the quarrel adjust itself if possible. When tutor and pupils have a difference, I act on the assumption that there must be faults on both sides, and I look for mutual concessions, standing aloof so long as there is any chance of an understanding being arrived at.\" This statement of policy was no news to Bissett. How often had he seen ardent young tutors, on first joining the establishment, hurrying open-mouthed to its head, full of prosecutive zeal, with some tale as to this pupil's insubordination, or that one's per-"], [199, "Three Brace of Lovers. 193 sistent cutting of lectures, only to be baffled by the calm rejoinder, \" Fight it out among yourselves,\" expressed of course more elegantly, but always to the same effect ! So they did \" fight it out among themselves,\" \u2014 and it may be guessed which side generally had the worst of the skirmish. Thus Bissett had no mind to argue or explain, or in any way defend himself. He said not a word. While Mr. Mullinger harangued about mutual con cessions, he was conning over a picture of the immediate future. He would have to apologise \u2014 or leave, \u2014 that was certain. That he would never apologise, was equally certain ; so the only remaining question was, Where was he to go ? He could, of course, get a place at another establishment, and could hardly like his life less than he did at Beech grove. The drudgery, he thought, would be pretty much the same at one place as another. Personally, he cared little what became of him, but . . . what of the little home at Chatterby ? He had the villa upon his hands for another two years, and might not be able to sub-let it. Expenses were pressing somewhat heavily upon him already, and the move to other quarters would pretty well cripple him. But worst of all was the uprooting of his mother, who had settled down so happily, and, thanks in great measure to the good offices of her old friend Major Clinton, had been 13"], [200, "Three Brace of Lovers. 194 surrounded with kindnesses from the time of her first establishment in Chatterby. She must needs begin all over again in some other country-town, in some wretched cottage or other, where she might be for years without making a single friend. She was neither young nor strong. The thought of thus uprooting her was to Bissett the most painful feature of the situation. The upshot of the interview was contained in Mr. Mulliner's concluding sentences : \" I hope you '11 see your way to making up this little difficulty, my dear fellow \u2014 in your own interest, don't you know? Let me see \u2014 to day's Friday; our Line candidates will be leaving for town on Tuesday, won't they ? Come now, I '11 give you till then to come to an understanding with these young men. Let me advise you not to take an overstrained view ofthe matter. We 're often obliged to swallow our pride just to smooth things over. McLachlan spoke of expecting an apology from you, but will doubtless be contented with something less if you manage him properly. Have a quiet talk with him, smooth him down judiciously ; tell him he 's really a good fellow, and you 've always liked him \u2014 and that sort of thing. You '11 soon find him inclined to soften ; and Gawain is simply his echo. Take it quietly, Pyne, and all will come right, \u2014 if not, why I shall be com-"], [201, "Three Brace of Lovers. 195 pelled to give a more serious consideration to the case.\" With this ultimatum to collate and compare with McLachlan's, Bissett withdrew to consider his course. He was expected to apologise for telling the truth and going through with an unpleasant duty \u2014 that was the whole situation in brief. Had he been free to consider himself alone, he would have marched straight back to his cottage and packed up his things there and then ; as it was, he must needs do a little thinking before taking the step of thus burning his boats. But where to go ? \u2014 that was the present diffi culty. The tutor's room at Beechgrove was out of the question. His own cottage was so full of mutiny and sedition, that he could not enter his own room without hearing through the wall the rumble of Mac's voice, as he sat haranguing the various friends who came to condole with him and offer their assist ance in \" making it hot for Pyne.\" The parlour at \" The Anglers,\" again, was an unsafe retreat ; and as it poured with rain all day, it was useless to think of a sculling-boat. In fine, Bissett was driven to avail himself of a quiet haunt which had served him well on one or two former occasions \u2014 the village church. This little church, with its peaceful graveyard, was situated upon a point round which the curving 13"], [202, "196 Three Brace of Lovers. Drowse wended idly, showing little of Father Thames's sheen and glitter, and none of its healthy flow, but reflecting things with a dim vagueness, somewhat as the bucolic mind does passing events. The building was ancient, ivy-clad, deeply shadowed by tall elms, and the air about it was commonly filled by the lazy cawing of many rooks. The north door always stood open, the porch with its oaken seats offering kindly invitation to the tired wayfarer or casual passing artist. But the weather to-day, though seemingly good enough for a tutor, was too ungenial for artist or vagrant. As Bissett came threading his way among the moss-grown gravestones, with the rain lashing his face in hearty English-summer fashion, he perceived with satisfaction that the porch was tenantless. Under his arm he carried a thickish parcel, of a shape and size such as appeals familiarly to the publisher's reader. Entering the porch, he seated himself upon a bench with the bundle beside him. To kill it or keep it ? That was the first question awaiting decision ; the apology business must then be dealt with in due course. Now the hope of a literary aspirant has more lives than a cat, and Bissett had just awoke to this discovery. He had fondly thought that the first"], [203, "Three Brace of Lovers. 197 refusal of his novel must put him out of his pain ; but twenty-four hours had dispersed this delusion, thus making him acquainted with that special scourge of indestructible hope which belongs to the dangerous art of writing. Already, he perceived, the old insanity was returning ; the notion of a possible literary success was biassing his judgment even in this matter of the apology. This was bad \u2014 altogether bad. The evil would grow : time would increase the hope, and the real work \u2014 the tutorial work \u2014 would suffer in consequence. Heart-sickness of deferred hope would lessen his bread-earning power : in the end, his mother would have to suffer for his literary vanity, \u2014 they would have to descend together into some mean London lodging, bidding a long farewell to all the little refinements which made their present poverty tolerable. This reasonable forecast was the outcome of a luminous moment ; he had not before looked at things so straightly and clearly. After some hard thinking in the porch, with only the rain-drip to interrupt him, Bissett's decision was made. The novel and all the foolish hopes concerning his pretty cousin should drown together ; then he could start fair again, unhampered by any care or ambition beyond that of earning daily bread by the only certain method that offered itself. His demand upon life being thus reduced to workable"], [204, "198 Three Brace of Lovers. dimensions, he could plod through existence with a decent stoicism. Taking the parcel under his arm, he strode out into the rain again, making for the low wall of the churchyard which overhung the river. Arrived there, he looked across the dun-coloured water, pitted and ringed by the scourging of the skies. For a moment his will went sodden, like everything around him ; and a puling hesitation \u2014 for which those who have ever fingered the quill will know how to pardon him \u2014 possessed the young author. This passed, however. He took hold, figura tively of himself, literally of the parcel of MS., and with a powerful heave sent the latter far out into the dull stream. It sank as though weighted with all the pains he had bestowed upon it \u2014 and its author could have sobbed like a girl. Instead of which, he smiled grimly, and strode back to the church. This time Bissett entered the building, and sat down in the chancel, facing the low pulpit, whence Mr. Mulliner was wont to deliver his excellent sermons. Had anyone seen the lad sitting there perfectly still, his face showing clearly enough that he was in no prayerful mood, the observer might have been puzzled to account for the solitary figure. A care worn old village-woman, or some young widow with fresh crepe and tear-stained cheeks, might have been"], [205, "Three Brace of Lovers. 199 discovered here without arousing much sense of unfitness ; but the picture as it stood seemed like the work of some grotesquely humorous artist, whose only aim was incongruity. However, this oddly placed model had the building to himself, and was able to settle his affairs without even disturbance from the rooks, who seemed to have had all the noise drowned out of them by the weather. Feeling, perhaps, that he had had enough of heroic measures for one day, he came to the conclusion not to apologise in any form whatever."], [206, "Three Brace of Lovers. 200 CHAPTER XII. M O N G the numbers of new people whose acquaintance Delicia had made about this time, the person who took her fancy most was not a member of the worshipping sex at all, but a very womanly woman, named Constance Marsh. It seemed, indeed, that either Puck himself, or some impish relative of his, must have been pulling the strings which worked Delicia and her friends just now, for these were getting twisted together in a peculiar and freakish manner. Lady Marsh, for instance, reciprocated Delicia's liking, and was doing her best to make much of her, all unconscious of thereby harbouring a dangerous rival; while Delicia, on her part, had not the least idea that by en couraging Hugo she was doing anything to endanger the happiness of her new friend. Happily for Constance Marsh, she was not an idle woman, and during this period of trying sus pense was able to solace herself by the practice of painting. She had studied Art pretty severely, for an amateur, in her younger days, and though the habit had fallen into abeyance during the society beauty phase of her existence, the old hankering"], [207, "She had studied Art pretty severely."], [208, "Three Brace of Lovers. 202 remained. Sir Jekyll had encouraged her talent, and during her widowhood it served her in good stead. Finding it a good thing for a solitary woman to have something to say upon canvas, she had worked hard, acquiring at length sufficient technical skill for the making of marketable pictures. Then she took to exhibiting, and sold pictures for the benefit of various charities, thus giving some point and purpose to her labours. This painting business, as it happened, helped to bring Lady Marsh into closer contact with Delicia; for the latter, though not absolutely perfect from some points of view, was, aesthetically speaking, almost unimpeachable. A face at once so dainty of outline and opulent of colour had an irresistible appeal for wielders of brush and mahlstick, and Constance Marsh at first cultivated Miss de Ribeau's acquaintance with the express view of asking for a sitting. Delicia needed little persuasion, but frankly admitted her willingness to sit \u2014 indeed, to give an}' number of sittings \u2014 and perhaps Lady Marsh would send her portrait to the Academy or Grosvenor next year ? The sitter was equally delighted to talk, and enlivened her portrayer's labours by many naive confessions and admissions. Thus their intimacy advanced with the progress of the picture. It must be said for Delicia that she had an"], [209, "Three Brace of Lovers. 203 innate tendency to cultivate the acquaintance of people superior to herself, as though conscious of having good stuff in her which needed developing from without. For instance, she had a genuine love and admiration for Aunt Sybil, whose thinking was upon a much higher plane than her own ; and as a woman who had seen something of the world without allowing herself to sink to its general level, Constance Marsh might have been classed with Mrs. Pyne. Delicia was frankly aware that the companionship of such women as these was a needed corrective to her own somewhat mundane tendencies. \" I am abominably worldly,\" she would sigh to Lady Marsh, \" and I do believe my aims and ambi tions are contemptible enough.\" Meanwhile the portrait advanced so steadily that on the Saturday following Bissett's rupture with McLachlan, Delicia was driven up to Ashlands for the final sitting. But Lady Marsh was on this occasion troubled with a headache, brought on doubtless by the wear of continually deferred hope, and found herself unequal to the delicate finishing work required. Accordingly they quitted the studio in favour of the river meadows ; though, not wishing to waste her model altogether, the artist prepared to make a rough sketch of her among the reeds and water plants. It was a heavy, slumberous day, unfavourable to"], [210, "Three Brace of Lovers. 204 labour of any kind ; and Constance Marsh found herself less inclined to study her model than to gaze up and down the river \u2014 with a vague hope, per haps, of seeing someone whom she had often watched secretly as he rowed or paddled to and from Winkleigh. Delicia too seemed disquieted and out of sorts ; she paced the grass impatiently, while the artist adjusted her easel and languidly handled her tubes of paint. \" Constance,\" she began presently, for they had arrived at Christian names some time ere this, \" I 'm in a sort of fix \u2014 at least, in a state of tiresome doubt and hesitation.\" \" Is it another love-affair, dear ?\" \"Well . . . not exactly a new one.\" \" Perhaps one of the old ones has reached an acute stage ?\" \"Ye-s\u2014 something of that sort.\" Delicia was still moving uneasily about, plucking a flower now and then only to throw it away again. \" You see, Constance, my cousin Bissett is coming home this Saturday.\" \" Well ? \" \" He hasn't been home for weeks.\" \" I respect your cousin's resolution, dear.\" \" You think it is resolution, then \u2014 not simply coldness ? \" \" My dear, I gather from hints you have let fall"], [211, "Three Brace of Lovers. 205 lately that you have taken great pains to disturb his peace of mind, and it is scarcely likely that he has escaped scot-free.\" \" I hope not,\" murmured the ingenuous Delicia. \" That hope is rather a dangerous symptom ?\" \" But you see, Constance, considered as a parti, Bissett is simply ridiculous.\" \" That verdict applies to many of your present following, does it not?\" \"Ah! but there's one important exception; at least, I think so.\" \" Indeed ! Then now we are getting to the root of the trouble.\" \" The other man is, I believe, a somebody.\" \"And so you 're a little afraid of letting sentiment interfere with business ? Forgive my putting it so crudely.\" \" Don't mention it ; I go in for plain-speaking myself. The fact is, you know, I 'm not fit to be a poor man's wife. Fancy settling down \u2014 for good \u2014 in Chatterby ! I should pine away and die, were I to attempt the experiment. What I really want is to be \" \"A fashionable beauty, the comet of a season, and that sort of thing?\" \" Yes, yes ! \" cried Delicia, with a flash of her fine eyes ; \"let me play that part for a year or two, and then \u2014 I don't care what becomes of me.\""], [212, "206 Three Brace of Lovers. \" My dear, you should avoid the part as a true gambler should avoid play\u2014 it would end by breaking your heart.\" \"But you 've played the role yourself, Constance ? \" \" Yes, for two seasons ; after which, Lady Mary Porthcurnow obliterated me as completely as though I had never existed. Now, I put this to you, Delicia, what would be your state under like circumstances ?\" \" Was your heart broken, Constance ? \" No, because it was never wrapped up in the business ; indeed, my heart was \u2014 hardly \u2014 in my own keeping.\" This confession, and the sudden change of tone in which it was made, came as a great surprise to the listener. There was something reckless, almost jarring, about this unlooked-for admission on the part of a gentle, reticent woman whom Delicia was wont to regard, not only as her own superior, but as the possessor of everything in the world worth having. Yet Lady Marsh, though half-frightened at the plunge she had made, was conscious of the relief which comes of even hinting at one's secret grief. \"Something separated you from \u2014 him, then?\" Delicia murmured, instinctively sinking her voice out of deference to her friend's troubled expression. \" Oh yes,\" whispered Constance, with her eyes"], [213, "Three Brace of Lovers. 207 bent upon the grass, \" something did separate us \u2014 and you can guess the rest. I \u2014 I don't wish to talk about myself any more ; so tell me about your own difficulty, dear, and let me play the candid friend who is anxious for your happiness.\" \" Well, the fact is, Constance, that if Aunt Sybil had brought me up from the beginning, instead of my other aunt, I might now be a happy and con tented creature ; but, between the two influences, I have now come to be rather wretched. I had social ambition, and all that sort of thing, well drilled into me to start with ; yet now somehow I 'm beginning to think that a good match, of itself, wouldn't quite complete the life of a woman.\" \"You're right,\" said Constance earnestly. \"And forgive me for uttering such a commonplace, but the only things that do make up a true and wholesome life for a woman are\u2014 love and home and children. The statement 's a platitude, but, believe me, a sound one ; and I don't think a succession of Society triumphs would ever fill up your existence, Delicia. You have better instincts, which after a time would infallibly cry out for satisfaction. And \u2014 to be per fectly frank with you \u2014 I believe the translation from the great world to a small one has been good for you ; and though you now seem to have come to the meeting of two roads, I've great hopes that you'll choose the quieter and happier.\""], [214, "Three Brace of Lovers. 208 \" But doyou think I 'm fitted for love in a cottage, Constance ?\" \" No, I don't ; but from what little I 've heard of your cousin, I should put him down as a man of spirit and enterprise, who will end by achieving something better than a cottage. Give him a little hope to work upon, and he '11 carve out a fortune in time.\" \" The worst of it is, Constance, that I have encouraged his rival a good deal lately ; not to the extent of going out of my way to win his heart, as I'm afraid I have done with Bissett, but I'm bound to say I have accepted the man's attentions up to a certain point. I'm afraid he'll be in a bad way if I throw him over now.\" \" He can't have been in love very long ; is he so very devoted, dear ? \" \" I think his trouble only began at that picnic of Major Clinton's ; but since then the affair has been progressing rather rapidly. That foolish little Chat terby is talking of our engagement already, I'm told.\" \"Poor fellow! I fear you'll have to disappoint him, dear \u2014 unless my lecture has come too late.\" \"Now I come to think of it, Constance, you must know the man, for I remember your shaking hands with him just after he had played Maud Calshott's accompaniments?\""], [215, "Three Brace of Lovers. 209 Constance Marsh's pale cheek grew paler, and she put up her hand as though to loosen the throat of her dress. Delicia, however, was looking up the reach towards Winkleigh, and noticed nothing. \" I 'm speaking, of course, of Mr. Hugo,\" she concluded calmly. After the blank wearing suspense of the last few weeks, Constance had imagined that any item of news, good or bad, would be welcome : she could now realise the fallacy of this assumption. Her palette and brushes slid from her knee, for a moment or two her slim figure swayed upon the sketching stool ; but happily Delicia was walking towards the river bank, and exclaimed at this moment : \" Ah ! yes, it is Bissett coming down the reach in that Canadian canoe. He shall give me a passage, then, Constance, and I needn't trouble you to drive me home. You've given up the idea of making a sketch of me to-day, haven't you ?\" \" Yes ; I think I won't trouble you this morning, thanks. These heavy brooding days make one lazy, don't they?\" \" Bissett ! Bissett ! I want you to give me a passage home !\" called Delicia to the canoeist, who was now nearly abreast of where she stood. \" I mustn't keep him waiting, Constance, and I needn't say good-bye, for we shall meet at the cricket match this afternoon, sha'n't we ? Don't forget that you've H"], [216, "Three Brace of Lovers. 210 promised to come and see us beat Chesning. I'm so much obliged for all your sympathy and advice, and I think you have nearly decided me.\" \" You had better forget all about that, Delicia. After all, it is best to disregard the meddling of friends, and decide one's own fate. Don't let my advice bias you one way or the other.\" \" Bissett looks very grumpy,\" muttered Delicia, \"or I'd make him come ashore; but the fact is, I would sooner let you see him at his best. Good bye, dear, and au revoir!\" Bissett's mood certainly deserved the epithet \"grumpy,\" \u2014 so much so, that upon catching sight of his cousin, he was much inclined to turn back again, and put off the Chatterby visit for another week. He wished to avoid Delicia as much as possible now ; for, after drowning his novel and finally deciding to accept his dismissal from Beech grove, he felt himself once more at the very bottom of the ladder. Nothing but flat disappointment could possibly come of dalliance with pretty cousins now. For a man whose proper business is the treadmill, he thought, it were better to walk straight into the prison-yard, without stopping to senti mentalise over the flowers outside. Yes, he had resolved to avoid her ; yet here she was, standing upon the bank above him, beckoning imperiously, with the evident intention of joining him \u2014 and looking"], [217, "Three Brace of Lovers. 211 abominably pretty. His gloom deepened as he paddled alongside the bank. But Delicia was by no means dashed by his sulky aspect, though doubtless intending to punish him for it presently. \"I suppose you're coming down the river with me ? \" he asked rather tartly. \" Yes, I am \u2014 in spite of your rudeness, Bissett.\" \" Do you wish to do any paddling ? \" \" No; but I'm not going to sit with my back to you \u2014 you must alter the position of that cushion. That 's better : now you must hold my flowers for a minute. Will you condescend to give me a hand, or must I get in without assistance ? \" She held out a small hand\u2014 clasping which, Bissett was troubled with a second's intoxication. It was just one of those moments \u2014 brief, yet with an odd capacity for dwelling in the memory \u2014 which he had avoided of late, by clinging to Beechgrove for three whole weeks. For a short time, until she was seated on the cushion, he lost his head altogether ; then regained it with an effort, just as he grasped his paddle. Delicia looked round to wave a farewell to her friend, but Lady Marsh had disappeared behind a clump of willows. Then she settled herself com fortably, hoisted a parasol, and smiled saucily in her cousin's face. 14 *"], [218, "Three Brace of Lovers. 212 \" Bissett, I 've got a rod in pickle for you.

I know you think me plain, but surely I'm passable? You have utterly deserted us, I say; and now that you've at last condescended to pay us a visit, you look about as cheerful as a convict newly sentenced !

She listened attentively. \" I know it will vex you to be obliged to uproot your mother,\" she commented, after a pause; \" but, in other respects, why should you be downhearted ? It will be a gain, rather than not, to quit that selfish, plausible Mr. Mulliner; and even if you fail in getting another place, there's our great secret, the novel \" \" That's dead and buried : it has found a watery grave.\" \" Do you mean to say you have destroyed it?\" He then described to her the funeral obsequies of the great work. This time her face grew full of resentment as she listened. \"And I imagined you a man of spirit!\" she muttered, scathingly. \" You made a mistake \u2014 I have none.\""], [221, "Three Brace of Lovers. 215 \" And no ambition either \u2014 no wish to hew out a career for yourself?\" \" None whatever ; my only hope is, to be a hack tutor for the remainder of my days.\" Delicia thereupon leaned back in what she felt to be a majestic silence. Taking his every word seri ously, and not in the least comprehending his mood, she was deeply offended. Either Bissett cared nothing for her \u2014 in which case all her pains had been thrown away \u2014 or he was a poor-spirited creature, incapable of making a serious effort to win her. She disliked one horn of the dilemma as much as the other. This spoiled young beauty could not enter into the bitterness of a straightforward man upon first discovering that honesty, though good ethics, is sometimes the worst policy. Bissett's hot young heart was rankling under the knowledge that the performance of a difficult duty had led to disaster. A little slurring of it would, he knew, have saved him ; a little soft-sawdering of McLachlan, a little relaxation of his own self-respect, would straighten the matter in a moment. He inferred that he would find pretty much the same state of things elsewhere ; that he must fight the world with its own mean weapons, or consent to be a pauper all his life. A little free railing against human nature, the world in general, and his own particular profession\u2014 in a word,"], [222, "Three Brace of Lovers. 216 a brief opening of the emotional safety-valve with which kindly Dame Nature always furnishes her sons \u2014 would quickly have lightened his mood, and freshened up his hope ; but Delicia only snubbed him with a chilling silence. \" I see how it is,\" thought he ; \" I 'm a failure, and so she turns against me.\" \" I know he doesn't care for me,\" thought she, \" so I shall encourage Mr. Hugo ; \" adding with pleasing inconsequence, \" I believe he does care for me \u2014 and I intend to make him smart!\" And so the misunderstanding pair glided down the familiar reaches, Delicia humming a tune, Bissett plying his paddle in dogged silence. It seemed that Lady Marsh might have spared herself the trouble of delivering that lecture."], [223, "Three Brace of Lovers. 217 CHAPTER XIII. HE silence of the two cousins continued unbroken until they touched the boat house raft, where they found them selves in the heart of a chattering throng. The change was as abrupt as that from the quiet of a country lane to the stir and movement of a crowded drawing-room. Chatterby was, in fact, in a highly effervescent condition to-day, on account of a certain function which was to take place at three p.m. in a large field adjoining the Tennis Club. This was nothing less than a ladies' cricket-match, about which everyone had been talking for the last month or more. Several boatloads, all talking of the coming event, were discharging themselves as Bissett deftly shot his canoe alongside the raft, and he was immediately assailed by half-a-dozen voices. But, under pressure of personal anxiety, he had entirely forgotten this important matter, and at first wondered what all the pother was about. His forgetfulness was an added source of offence to his cousin. It was her match ; she had conceived it and got it up, had taken immense pains about it, and had paid Bissett the compliment of asking him to umpire for her side."], [224, "218 Three Brace of Lovers. She now decided not even to walk up the town with him. But if Bissett was lukewarm, others were not ; Miss de Ribeau quickly found herself the centre of an admiring throng. And certainly she had earned some homage ; for had she not these three weeks been selecting, drilling, and generally licking into shape the Chatterby Eleven, whose chosen captain she was ? Moreover, the Long Vacation being now in full swing, we may be sure Captain Delicia de Ribeau had had the very best coaching talent at her disposal. Cricket, as the reader knows, had never been viewed as a mere pastime in this athletic centre : in Chatterby you might be careless about mere work, if you pleased, but a game was no joking matter. The team of petticoats had been steadily coached by 'Varsity \"Blues,\" and had slaved away at their practising with all the conscientiousness of the fair sex ; at least, had begun to do so as soon as the most momentous question of all \u2014 that of costume \u2014 had been definitely settled. That question took time, and proved a wearing one to Captain Delicia. She spent the best of ten days driving to and fro with the Dodds before an arrangement could be arrived at. The Chesning party, possibly with a view to cutting out their opponents, had demanded a free hand in the matter of dressing for the great match ; while Chatterby,"], [225, "Three Brace of Lovers. 219 with its true athletic instincts and deep reverence for the game, would not hear of its being turned into a mere masquerade for the schoolboys to jeer at. Here was a deadlock to begin with ; and other issues of importance called for settlement, to discuss which were to write a dissertation upon half the weaknesses of human nature. Suffice it that both elevens eventually agreed to appear in genuine white flannel, with natty straw hats, blue-ribboned on the part of Chesning (suggestive of their blue blood, as the harassed Captain de Ribeau remarked) and pink on that of Chatterby. The only opening for taste ful coquetry permitted was offered by an extra adornment in the shape of a silken sash of any colour the wearer might choose. Even this indul gence would be a hindrance to uniformity \u2014 but it certainly comforted many aching hearts. All this Bissett gathered from the young folks on the raft, but the only feature of the proceedings that really struck him was the prominent part taken in them by his friend Hugo. It seemed that no one could speak of the match without mentioning Hugo's name. He had awoke to find himself the most prominent person in Chatterby. He had coached each member of the team in succession \u2014 especially the captain ; he was at the beck and call of everyone \u2014 especially, again, of the captain."], [226, "Three Brace of Lovers. 220 This frequent cropping up of his friend's name gave Bissett matter for reflection during his solitary walk up the town. He began for the first time to realise in what manner Hugo had been solacing himself since his disappointment at the picnic, and thereupon to add the pangs of jealousy to his other vexations. So Delicia was the person with whom the per verse philosopher had chosen to philander until such time as his temper should recover ! Delicia was to be talked about and made conspicuous in order to provide him with amusement ! Such treatment of his cousin was a breach of friendship \u2014 an imperti nence. What could his mother be thinking of to allow the girl to be played with like a child's toy ? How could Delicia permit . . . and so on, and so on. By the time Bissett reached home he had worked himself into a state of honest indignation which, as a perfectly disinterested cousin, did him credit. Yet Mrs. Pyne welcomed dear Bissett joyfully; she would rather have him home in the worst of tempers than not see him at all. True, dear Bissett was inclined to be censorious ; for when things go wrong, a man naturally likes to fasten the blame upon one of the inferior sex. He conceived that his mother should have been stricter with the girl, have kept a more watchful eye upon her, etc., etc. Mrs. Pyne listened meekly; as a wife and mother, she had"], [227, "Three Brace of Lovers. 221 doubtless learned that such little censurings are a part of the fitness \u2014 or at anyrate, the inevitableness \u2014 of things. But if meek, this mother was not blind ; and regretfully gathered from her son's rather angry tone that he was troubled with the little weakness for Delicia which she had suspected. After lunch Hugo called to take Mrs. Pyne and her niece down to the cricket-ground, for Bissett had half expected to be tied to Beechgrove again this Saturday. Whether Hugo would have deeply regretted his absence may be questioned, but he certainly did not allow Bissett's presence to hinder his own amuse ment in any degree. Perhaps a suspicion as to his friend's jealousy rather tended to put him on his mettle, and gave an additional relish to the situation. In the course of the last few weeks Hugo had become a distinguished member of Chatterby society ; and probably the sense of being on a holiday, away from his own set, had turned his head a little. As an Englishman, going abroad for the first time, is sometimes apt to shake off the insular trammels too readily, and think himself free to live anyhow, dress anyhow, and do anything, so did Hugo, perhaps, expand a thought too freely in this Arcadian atmo sphere. Under other circumstances, he would certainly have been more cautious in his attentions"], [228, "Three Brace of Lovers. 222 to Delicia ; yet surely here, if anywhere in this harassing world, a man might relax a little, and taste the simple joys of freedom ? When Miss de Ribeau came into the cottage drawing-room dressed for the cricketing fray, Hugo at once took possession of her. She was attired, of course, in white flannel, with straw hat pink-trimmed, and a pink silk sash round her dainty waist. Also she wore a scarf round the left arm as a badge of captainship. Bissett scoffed at the latter as an un workmanlike addition ; but Hugo protested that it was highly correct, as well as becoming. Miss de Ribeau thereupon retorted by asking him to umpire for Chatterby this afternoon. \"My cousin,\" she explained, \"is so lukewarm about the whole thing, that he will doubtless be glad to escape the task.\" But Hugo could not acquiesce in this palpable attempt to snub his friend ; indeed, he was a little alarmed at Miss de Ribeau's growing complaisance towards himself. Not being in the stricken condi tion which her vanity had readily inferred from his conduct of late, he was naturally visited by occasional qualms. Thus these interesting young people, whom Chatterby had already engaged and well-nigh married, were troubled by reciprocal, but quite causeless, alarm. Delicia had no idea that he was simply amusing himself; while Hugo had not the"], [229, "Three Brace of Lovers. 223 least conception that she was merely encouraging him for the purpose of annoying Bissett. While they were discussing the umpire question Major Clinton made his appearance, proposing to drive some of them down to the cricket-ground. \"Well, Miss de Ribeau, this looks like business . . . Wha' . . .?\" he chuckled, shaking hands with the dashing young captain. \" Going to make a big score, and carry your bat, eh ?\" \"I'm not so sure about that, for, the fact is, Maisie Gawain bowls very fast, and I 'm half afraid of the ball. I can bowl pretty well, however, for my brother used to make me practise constantly that I might be of use to him in the holidays. I tried to make Maisie desert her side and play for us, because her bowling frightens me so ; but she was so ill natured as to refuse.\" \"Here's feminine morality for you!\" cried the major. \" Did you tamper with any more of the opposing eleven ? \" asked Bissett scathingly. \" No \u2014 for the others are not worth it. I think we shall beat them easily ; if not, I shall order an adjournment to afternoon tea, which is to be pre pared in the pavilion, and find myself too fatigued to continue play afterwards. I won't be beaten ! \" \" You had better bribe the scorer, to made quite certain!\" suggested Bissett."], [230, "Three Brace of Lovers. 224 \" Oh no, there'll be no need. I shall put them in first, for I know my girls will be too nervous to bat in the early part of the match ; and we shall get them out for less than fifty.\" \" But suppose you don't win the toss Wha'?\" \" I have no intention of tossing up. I shall insist, out of sheer good-nature, upon their taking first innings.\" The men laughed in chorus at this ; but Captain Delicia knew what she wanted, and meant to get it, despite all the male critics in existence. As three o'clock, the important hour, was now drawing near, it was decided to make a move. The major drove Hugo and Delicia; Bissett and his mother followed on foot. Upon reaching the ground, the last-named pair were not a little astonished at the appearance it pre sented. Half the country-side seemed to have emptied itself into the emerald rectangle. One long side of it was completely covered with carriages, the rest of the field being a moving mass of dark figures. About nine-tenths of the four hundred and fifty boys who composed the big school were scat tered among the crowd, some critically examining the pitch, all of them agog with mingled excitement, curiosity and contempt. The girls, the women, the petticoats, were going"], [231, "Three Brace of Lovers. 225 to play a game of cricket. Such a thing had been heard of elsewhere, \u2014 indeed, ladies' cricket was said to be \"coming in\"- \u2014 but here, in Chatterby, with its splendid School elevens, its county players, its 'Varsity \" Blues \" ! Had the girls gone mad that they should perpetrate this thing ? \" I hope one or two of 'em will get their shins well bruised, and so learn that cricket isn't all beer and skittles ! \" muttered Blenkinsop primus viciously. \"If they do, I know what '11 happen \u2014 they'll blub ! \" piped Hawkins quartus, the captain of the School Fifth Eleven. \" Girls playin' cricket ! Jerusalem !\" The two elevens were gathered in a creamy cluster about the door of the little pavilion at the south-eastern corner of the ground, talking rather harder, perhaps, than men-players would have done, but not forgetting to lean upon bats and take up such professional attitudes as seemed proper to the occasion. Miss de Ribeau and Miss Dodd, the two captains, stood forth conspicuous, each with bat under arm, and both, it must be admitted, chattering their hardest. The ceremony of tossing-up was omitted ; but Captain de Ribeau evidently won her point, for amidst a general cheer, veined with some tittering from the smaller boys, the pink-ribboned Chatterby team came forth and took the field. The umpires, 15"], [232, "Such professional attitudes as seemed proper to the occasion."], [233, "Three Brace of Lovers. 227 Bissett Pyne and Harry Dodd, assumed their places, and play was commenced in very business-like fashion. Miss de Ribeau, after a workman-like glance over the field and a slight alteration of long-leg's position, proceeded to deliver the first over from the pavilion end. \" Field isn't at all badly placed,\" said Blenkinsop condescendingly, \" and de Ribeau bowls pretty straight, for a girl.\" It was, in fact, evident that Miss de Ribeau's practice with her brother had given her considerable dexterity with the ball. She bowled round-hand, in rather good style, and much faster than the bats woman who faced her seemed to approve of. Miss Dodd was shaking with nervousness, and poked the second ball clean into point's hands ; though the latter, who happened to be little Maud Calshott, dropped it with a slight squeak and a wringing of her small hands. A low ripple of laughter went round the field ; Hawkins quartus was so indecently convulsed that Blenkinsop found it necessary to punch the small boy's head. The third ball went just over the bails ; Miss Dodd could make nothing of either the fourth or fifth. Thus Captain de Ribeau sent down \" a maiden\" to start with, and everyone began to prophesy that Chesning would \" get a licking.\" 15 *"], [234, "228 Three Brace of Lovers. Miss Calshott's bowling from the other end, how ever, proved to be of a feeble order. Runs began to come in this over ; two more catches were missed ; the field was getting flurried, and made some rather wild shots at the wicket, thus giving Chesning four or five extras. Miss de Ribeau decided to change the bowler, and sternly reprimanded the bad fielding. She wished now that the ten days or so given to the dress question had been expended upon practice. But her own bowling rather improved than not ; she had the advantage of not being nervous, and soon got very much \" on the spot,\" as Blenkinsop fully admitted. \"With two or three years' hard practice, she'd be good enough for one of our lower Elevens,\" he remarked, good-naturedly. \"Bravo, de Ribeau!\" cried the irrepressible Hawkins. \"She'll bowl 'em all out for thirty, I believe ! Je-rusalem \u2014 there goes another wicket ! \" In short, the wickets were falling fast before Chatterby's redoubtable captain, and the cheering was tremendous. The young men who had so anxiously coached this bowler vowed by all their gods that she did them credit. Something like a scare was by this time estab lished among the visitors. They came droopingly to the wickets, to be dismissed in quick succession, after hardly touching the ball."], [235, "Three Brace of Lovers. 229 But at this juncture there appeared a champion, in the shape of a stranger, who had arrived at Chesning Grange but two days since. Nothing was known as to her cricketing powers ; but Miss Dodd, being a man \u2014 or rather a woman \u2014 short, had been glad to accept her services. The new comer was tall, with high shoulders, and a somewhat boyish walk. She came swinging out of the pavilion, bat under arm, pooh-poohing the encouragements of those around her. \"It's all rot to be frightened,\" she exclaimed ; \" at the worst, one can but get out first ball ! \" This fair batswoman, though but lately returned from a finishing course at a Parisian school, was as slangy as an English youth of twelve or fourteen. She was rather a pretty girl, with a round face and merry eyes, and a good deal of fluffy fair hair loosely waving. Out of all the throng of lookers-on, only one person knew her by sight \u2014 for her kinsman Hugo had never set eyes on her before \u2014 and that one was her father, Col. Treveldoe. The colonel had been duly informed, by a letter forwarded from the Club, of Julia's arrival in the neighbourhood. He was now standing, embedded in the crowd, with strange thrills traversing his short square frame. A curious mixture of feelings possessed him as Julia came forth into the open ; but, on the whole, he felt miserable. The comedy"], [236, "Three Brace of Lovers. 230 of the situation was, owing to his lack of humour, quite lost upon him. He had decided to keep his secret to the last possible moment, for further reflec tion had strengthened his conviction that discovery would upset all his plans, to say nothing of making Julia wretched. She was an impetuous and affec tionate daughter, whom it would horrify to find her father burying himself in a cottage, in order to permit of her going from one country-house to another enjoying herself. Yes, she must be kept absolutely in the dark, if only it could be managed. After this one glimpse of her, the colonel resolved to avoid the town and public roads altogether, until the ten days' visit should be over. With his gardening and fishing, he would have plenty of occupation. Yet it cost him a sharper pang than he had looked for, to be thus peeping at his daughter from the crowd without so much as getting a smile from her. Hugo, who was standing with his cousin, guessed from the colonel's face that this must be Julia, but hardly had time to be amused before it became his turn to be sorry for himself. For, just as Julia Treveldoe played her first ball, Lady Marsh's Victoria drove on to the ground, passing close behind where Hugo and the colonel were standing. The crowd had to make way for the carriage,"], [237, "Three Brace of Lovers. 231 which moved at a foot's pace, and Hugo had time for a good look at its single occupant. She seemed sad, he thought, and so out of place among all these lively people. It would be a graceful act on his part now to go to her side, and tell her all about the match, and let her see that his fit of ill-temper was passing away. His conscience began to prick him, too, for dalliance with Miss de Ribeau. Certainly he had behaved like a fool \u2014 a thoughtless fool \u2014 and with little enough consideration for Miss de Ribeau, who was young enough to take his attentions seriously. In a word, he was just now rational enough to be ashamed of himself. Now was Constance Marsh's opportunity, if she really wished to re-win this perverse and wayward, but repentant, lover. She had but to give him an opening \u2014 a bow, with the least bit of warmth in it would do \u2014 and the victory would be complete. But, thanks to Delicia's naive revelations this morning, she was bitterly indignant with Hugo, and accord ingly executed a bow frigid and repelling enough to wound his vanity seriously, and cause his penitence to evaporate like a bubble. Meanwhile the game was growing more lively. Julia Treveldoe punished both bowlers in a way which delighted the crowd ; and Chatterby was too genuinely sportsmanlike not to cheer an opponent's success. Runs came fast ; the gloom of the visitors"], [238, "Three Brace of Lovers. 232 was perceptibly brightening, when there occurred an incident, almost tragic, judging by the disturbance it created. Miss de Ribeau bowled a half-volley, which the new batswoman returned sharply; she put up her hands for the catch, but the ball, though deadened, slipped through and struck her on the mouth. With boy players the match would not have been interrupted for a moment ; as it was, there was a veritable stampede. All the field came rushing to the wickets, to console and support the wounded bowler. The umpires alone stood motionless and aghast. Was there ever such a breach of solemn cricketing etiquette ? \"Ho-ho! now she'll blub!\" cried Hawkins quartus, delightedly. But no other sound was heard from the school ranks ; a kind of awe at this painful breach of the decorum of the arena seemed to be upon them. A crack in the mouth ! Was that all ? Why, a collar-bone had been smashed on the last day of the football season in this very field, without half the fuss. It must be reluctantly admitted, too, that, Haw kins proved a true prophet on this occasion \u2014 Captain de Ribeau did shed tears. The pain was sharp ; the blood flowing freely from the lip frightened her. Her fellows gazed reproachfully at the stranger who had done this thing."], [239, "Three Brace of Lovers. 233 The latter was decently apologetic, yet a little scornful, which at once put Delicia upon her mettle. She staunched the blood with her handkerchief, waved them all back to their places, and, to the relief of the umpires, resumed play. The other wickets fell easily ; the stranger made the only score of her side \u2014 eighteen not out \u2014 and was heartily cheered as she walked into the pavilion. In spite of the bad fielding, Chesning had only suc ceeded in putting together a total of forty-seven. The next event was afternoon tea in the pavilion \u2014 another breach of cricketing propriety. \" However,\" quoth Blenkinsop to his friends, \" I 'm glad they are going to indulge. Cut them out of their tea-cake and chatterin', and we should have more tears before the end of the match ! \" Now was the time for Chesning to make up for its poor display in the field. A little civility to their hostess, interspersed with a compliment or two, would have earned for them praise and sympathy ; but, alas ! the disappointment proved too much for them \u2014 they seemed incapable of the least magnan imity. Not that they were openly sulky, like small boys who have not yet learned to accept failure like men; but \u2014 to put it bluntly and crudely \u2014 they swaggered. They held themselves haughtily aloof, allowing their opponents to see clearly that, though they had"], [240, "Three Brace of Lovers. 234 condescended so far as to play against the town, they were not going to permit of any ex-official intimacy. This meaning was emphasised, too, by their singling out Captain de Ribeau as the only person worthy of attention. Around her they gathered, bubbling over with compliments. Her bowling was superb ; her pluck, when wounded, admirable. Had Lord Hengist coached her ? Would she give them lessons ? and so on, ad nauseam. Bissett Pyne regarded the scene contemptously, mentally scoring down additional black marks against the \" Hybrids.\" He and one or two other men, who were handing things about, fared as badly as the girls. The wearers of the Chesning azure-blue accepted their attentions in a way which made them feel like professional waiters. But the philosopher Hugo had the hardest treatment of all ; for, when he approached Miss Dodd, tea-cup in hand, she recog nised the man who had made her feel so small at the picnic \u2014 the doubtful personage who had made game of her, as she believed, by knowledge drawn, not from experience, but from sporting novels. And, so recognising him, she looked calmly in his face, and cut him dead before the two-and-twenty lady crick eters and their friends. Never in his life had the pampered fellow been so treated ; he looked stunned for a moment, then bowed gravely and withdrew."], [241, "Three Brace of Lovers. 235 Miss Dodd's friends were sorry she had gone so far, and tried to make up for her rudeness by a little spasmodic civility to their hostess. Bissett was pleased to see that his cousin deeply resented this treatment of her friends. \"They are 'Hybrids,'\" she whispered to him. \"I've quite come round to your view of these people ! \" The stranger, Miss Treveldoe, of course took no part in the snubbing process ; nor, indeed, was she aware what was going forward, being engaged in a corner, talking and laughing with Harry Dodd. The latter, who had so obstinately stood out against the charms of Delicia, was, as it happened, vastly attracted by this rattling slangy schoolgirl. \" I like Miss Treveldoe,\" he had remarked to his sisters last night, \" and I wish you had more friends like her. The people we know are for the most part mushrooms, like ourselves, and tend to intensify your failings. But, as a girl of really good birth, Miss Treveldoe has no need of your abominable airs and graces. Miss de Ribeau isn't bad, but a deal too conceited to suit me.\" This was a doubtful way of recommending Julia to his sisters' good graces, but Master Harry had probably inherited this refreshing frankness from his father. Although so deeply engaged in his corner, Harry"], [242, "236 Three Brace of Lovers. had a tolerably clear impression of what was going on in the front of the pavilion ; and the single glance that he exchanged with his eldest sister made her thankful that she was to dine from home for the next two nights. After what had occurred, it will easily be con ceived that the desire to give Chesning a good beating was not lessened ; in fact, Captain de Ribeau and her team were now bent upon surpassing themselves. Indignation lent them nerve : every girl of them left her fears among the tea-things. Moreover, Miss Maisie Gawain, the crack bowler of the other side, so strongly disapproved of the captain's conduct, that they had a word or two about it while strolling to the wickets, and the consequent irritation did not tend to straighten her bowling. Two wides were delivered in her first over, while the bowling also proved too fast for the long-stop. Miss Gawain had to be taken off very shortly as too expensive ; and though Julia Treveldoe did better, the luck was against the visitors, or else Nemesis was swifter-footed than usual, for the upshot of the game was that they were beaten, amidst a great burst of cheering, by seven wickets, and the boys were with difficulty restrained from \"chairing\" Captain de Ribeau into the pavilion."], [243, "Three Brace of Lovers. 237 CHAPTER XIV. HEN Tuesday morning arrived without the passing of any further communica tion between McLachlan and himself, Bissett concluded that their little affair might be looked upon as settled. Three days of reflection had developed no inclination on his part to apologise \u2014 the inference being that his period of service at Beechgrove was at an end. On the whole, the probability of speedy dismissal troubled him less than it would have done a month ago. For, on the one hand his sense of outrage and injustice supported him ; on the other, the final putting aside of his literary hopes, which had lent a glamour of their own to his routine work, induced a certain reckless indifference as to the future. Tutorial servitude was to be his lot, and might as well be undergone in one place as another. Nor was there any question of starvation involved ; he could get another place as a matter of course, and with the better sort of army-crammers the circumstances of his dismissal would hardly tell very severely against him, while as for real advancement in his profession, he had given up all such chimerical notions. True, there was the uprooting of his mother to be faced ;"], [244, "238 Three Brace of Lovers. but even for her sake he could not sacrifice his personal honour by a degrading apology. To tide over the expense of moving he must accept temporary help from his uncle. His pride was so far bent now that such a course seemed no longer intolerable, and he had already written to Uncle Bissett ; the letter lay waiting to be posted. The tutor was smoking an after-breakfast pipe on the towing-path by Winkleigh lock and pondering the situation, when, to his great surprise, McLachlan appeared walking from the direction of the village, and came forward with the evident intention of addressing him. Mac had been completely sobered by his wrongs ; there was no question now as to his being \" brought to the post \" in fair working order. So far, the assault made upon him before the assembled Euclid class appeared to have been of real service to him. Pyne leaned against the lock-arm, contemplating the placid surface of the Drowse ; Mac advanced rapidly, switching the reeds and water plants with his cane. \"Good-morning, Mr. Pyne.\" Mac had a curious stubborn look as he planted himself firmly in front of the tutor and delivered this greeting. He was as fixedly resolved not to apologise as was Pyne himself. Though perfectly aware that he was by no means an injured innocent,"], [245, "Three Brace of Lovers. 239 it was not in his nature to indulge in anything like generous admission. He had never confessed a wrong in his life. Had he lived in the good old days when the rack was a familiar engine, and had a con fession been extorted from him by its means, he would have undone every word again the moment the levers were relaxed. But he did wish to make friends with Pyne again \u2014 were he properly received. Bissett's tutorial situation, in fact, hung upon the tone of his return \" Good-morning.\" Were his reply to prove anxiously civil, or in any way \" gushy,\" Mac would have extorted an apology, or declined fur ther discussion ; were it, on the other hand, austerely distant, Mac would have frozen immediately. As it was, Bissett cared little, so his tone was moderate and level. Accordingly Mac proceeded : \" With regard to our difference of the other night \" I have no intention of apologising,\" put in Bissett calmly. \" N-neither have I \u2014 not the 1-least ; so perhaps we might leave it so, and c-call it square ?\" \"Just as you please.\" \"All right; then I'll go and have breakfast, and inform Mr. Mulliner that our d-difference is settled.\" Bissett smiled a little at Mac's evident desire to clear his conscience without committing himself to"], [246, "Three Brace of Lovers. 240 the smallest admission of error. His own tempera ment was of another cast ; his pride, unlike McLachlan's would have compelled him to acknow ledge his fault, had he committed one. \"The fact is,\" Mac then proceeded, with a relieved air, \" that your friend Hugo dined Gawain and myself at ' The Anglers ' last night, and per suaded me that it was a pity not to p-part friends with you. I knew well enough that you hadn't put him up to it, for that wouldn't be your sort ; b-but I suspect your pretty cousin, Miss de Ribeau, who they say is engaged to him, or thereabouts, has been working upon him. Anyhow, I'm glad we're friends, for b-being pretty certain to pass, I'm not likely to be back here again. Shall we shake hands ?\" This ceremony was gone through without much warmth on either side. Nor, were they to meet again a thousand times, would their old feeling of comradeship revive, since to mend up a broken friendship with success both parties must supply warmth and generosity. As we shall see McLachlan no more, it may as well be stated that he succeeded in passing high \u2014 ninth out of six hundred candidates \u2014 largely owing to the infinite pains taken by his tutor. His future career will doubtless depend on what sort of regi ment he joins; a \"taut\" colonel may keep him straight ; but should he chance upon a weak one,"], [247, "Three Brace of Lovers. 241 Mac will be likely enough to wake some morning to the discovery that \" Her Majesty has no further need of his services.\" Pyne stayed on the towing-path, smoking rather fiercely. There would be no need now to apply to his uncle or to look out for another situation, and he would be free to accept his cousins' invitation to go yachting along the South coast during his vacation \u2014 to enjoy himself without thought of the future. He ought to have been well pleased with the turn things had taken ; but that brief reference to his cousin spoilt everything. He did not believe there was any engagement ; but it took his breath away to hear the thing spoken of in this callous way, and gave a certain squareness and solidity to his fears. Could the man be really consoling himself with Delicia ? Such inconstancy had been heard of before ; he could hardly write Hugo down a villain were he to prove as weak kneed as other men. He might be bitterly indignant ; but even his wrath must needs be dissembled, he would be able to get no real comfort out of it. Hugo could be very fascinating when he chose. He had walked home with Delicia after the match ; later on he had taken her on the river with the Calshotts ; he had met her, it appeared, very frequently at Major Clinton's ; he had coached her in bowling ; in short, he cropped up everywhere \u2014 confound him ! 16"], [248, "Three Brace of Lovers. 242 Had it been another man, Bissett would not have minded ; but a man who only the other day . . . Stay, would he mind much less were Brown or Jones on the eve of engagement to his cousin ? No, the sting of Brown or Jones would be just as sharp ; he was forced to admit that Delicia's engagement to any man, good, bad, or indifferent, would disquiet him more than enough. He hadn't the remotest chance of marrying her himself; yet he couldn't bear to think of her marrying anyone else. In fine, as he stood there ruminating by the lock basin, Bissett enjoyed a very bad quarter of an hour, and called himself by very hard names without getting much satisfaction out of the process. At any rate there was relief in the thought that he was going away so soon ; a few weeks' yachting with his cousins \u2014 a brace of ardent young mariners, with whom sailing meant \" cracking-on \" \u2014 would meet his views very well just now. Bissett hoped that, were this ill news about Delicia confirmed, August might prove one long gale of wind. He sauntered back to Beechgrove presently, however, in a somewhat improved frame of mind. After all, what did this Chatterby gossip amount to? The little place was always busying itself with some mythical engagement or other ; were all its reputed betrothals genuine, there would have been neither bachelor nor spinster left by now within ten miles"], [249, "Three Brace of Lovers. 243 of the place. Most probably Hugo had never dreamt of anything more than a week or two's philandering with a pretty girl. Bissett felt a grudge against this little twopenny gossiping Chatterby, whose tattle had scared him so : it would be pleasant to hear no more for a month or six weeks of its Arcadian picnics, and cricketing lunacy, and eternal tennis chatter, and, most of all, of its irritating mock-engagements. 16 *"], [250, "Three Brace of Lovers. 244 CHAPTER XV. HEN the School speech-day was over, and four hundred and fifty joyous youths had packed up and departed, Chatterby was wont to settle down into its quiet summer-holiday aspect. Some of the local families would be leaving for the sea-side ; but the larger portion of the old soldiers and sailors might still be found over their whist and black-pool at the Club, or walking busily up the town after their morning's gossip over the newspapers. The young folks who were left always voted this a capital time of the year, when one of the school-playing fields would probably be available for tennis, and you could pick and choose among the boats at the Club without troubling to put your name down beforehand. One feature of the season, however, was voted a nuisance by young and old alike \u2014 the advent of the hop-pickers. These ragged unfortunates, despite their forlorn appearance, were doubtless enjoying their holiday also, taking their annual breath of country air, and finding the out-door campaign life a pleasant enough change from the East End. They certainly pervaded"], [251, "Three Brace of Lovers. 245 the whole district, covering the main London Road with their miserable little traps and go-carts, cursing and beating their wretched donkeys, filling every ale-house in the neighbourhood, and enlivening the High Street with drunken brawls at all hours. To take a charitable view of this squalid legion, it is best to view them upon canvas only, picturesquely grouped about the bins amid forests of bine and rich golden-green clusters of grapes. In real life it needs a larger than average philosophy to excuse their existence at all. No one in the neighbourhood suffered more from this army of invaders than old Col. Treveldoe. His cottage was unfortunately in the heart of the hopping country, and detachments of the enemy were quar- tered in every barn and outhouse for miles round. One large nest of them had converted into a barrack a tumble-down oast-house within a few hundred yards of his door ; and they chose the river in his immediate vicinity for their watering-place, the inn at the cross-roads as their principal house of call, and the colonel's garden and hen-roost as their favourite foraging ground. He lived in a state of siege. His temper suffered so much from these con tinual harassments that Hugo was driven, perforce, to spend still more of his time at Chatterby. The stout old soldier, too, had another weighty grievance at this period \u2014 Julia was still at Ches-"], [252, "246 Three Brace of Lovers. ning Grange; and, judging by her letters, enjoying herself heartily. Three times she had been on the point of going ; each time they had pressed her to stay one week more. Consequently, her father dared not appear in Chatterby, or upon any of the main roads. Julia's presence in the neighbourhood involved his remaining a fixture in that morass o hop-pickers. The river had hitherto been his only playground ; but, as Julia's last letter had men tioned a coming boating expedition, even that would be unsafe now. In short, owing to different eddies of circumstance, his daughter was proving as restrictive as Dick Swiveller's duns. Now, it chanced one afternoon, that this beleag ured colonel was trying to make good a gap in his hedge with a bundle of dried hop-bine, when a pair of black horses, with a long waggonette behind them, came picking their way cautiously down the lane. The showy equipage had a startling effect upon this quiet corner, where even a country cart was a rare phenomenon. A group of the colonel's per secutors, some of whom were tinkering pots and kettles on the river-bank, while their youngsters dipped up water in buckets, threw down their work, and fell to what old play directions so aptly call \"alarums and excursions.\" The children supplied the alarums in the form of shrill cheers ; the elders"], [253, "Three Brace of Lovers. 247 hurried up the lane, putting on professional smiles as they ran, to make the most of this windfall of gentlefolks. The carriage drew up just below the colonel's wicket-gate, and the gentleman who held the ribbons \u2014 an immense man with a bulbous nose and black beard \u2014 turned his horses neatly at the wide ning of the lane. At once there uprose a plaintive chorus of begging. The big man grinned sardoni cally, crying : \" Good God ! Where do all you rascals spring from ? We 're taxed for your education, your com fortable maintenance in workhouses and prisons, and God knows what else, yet you're as prolific, pestilent, and insolent as ever ! \" \" Gi' us a tanner, and us '11 explain to your worship how 'tis,\" grinned one of the men, who seemed rather pleased with an address delivered in something like his own vernacular. \" I '11 see you d \u2014 d first,\" said the gentleman coolly. \" There goes a five-bob fine, my lord,\" cried an urchin of twelve ; \" damns is dear among the gentle folks ! \" Mr. Dodd laughed hoarsely at the youngster's impudence, then began to storm again, with his usual disregard of the ladies behind him. But these people had not wheedled \"the quality \""], [254, "248 Three Brace of Lovers. for years without mastering their business. They kept the big gentleman in play with chaff that seemed to suit his humour while the children attacked the ladies, and the women gathered round young Harry Dodd. Harry, who felt ashamed of his father, threw them some silver, saying : \" Look here ! You keep out of the way like decent people, and you shall have some grub. That's our boat rounding the corner, and it's full of hampers.\" \"Gawd bless you, kind gentleman!\" cried the women. \" Don't be a d \u2014 d fool! \" cried his father. \" 'Nother five-bob; go it, gu'vnor!\" squeaked the small boy. Harry's promise was a timely one. With a view to the \"grub,\" the hopping fellows drew off their families, and allowed the ladies to descend in peace. Meanwhile, Col. Treveldoe stood rooted to the ground, as the phrase goes, just behind the partially filled gap in the hedge. Recognising the Dodds, he assumed that Julia must be in the waggonette among the ladies, who were at present hidden from his view. He dared not move. If he tried to edge away towards the left, he would be seen through the open wicket; if he took a single step to the right, the lowness of the hedge would expose him. He stood"], [255, "Three Brace of Lovers. 249 there, in his gardening clothes, more scared than he had ever felt in the sharp hill-fighting of which he had seen so much on the Afghan frontier. Should Julia discover him now, it were far worse than if he had confessed weeks ago. The light talk and laughter of the party floated through the hedge, and seemed to prick him like the thorns against which he leaned. \" What a snug little cottage ! \" \u2014 Julia was speaking now. Her voice added a sharper note to his perturbation \u2014 \" Is it a gamekeeper's, do you think ? \" \" I haven't the least idea who lives there,\" Miss Dodd answered ; \" but, probably, some well-to-do labourer.\" \" Come along, Miss Treveldoe,\" called Harry, \" I want to get you all on board.\" \" All right \u2014 don't be in such a hurry ! \" cried the schoolgirl. And her tone of easy comradeship, which she never used save to those she really liked, jarred upon her father \u2014 as also had the tone of her last two or three letters. The style of this unconven tional daughter had struck the colonel as being a shade too poetical lately ; and, seeing that she did not appear much enamoured of the Dodd family in general, her excessive enjoyment of life at \" The Grange\" was somewhat alarming. The letters"], [256, "Three Brace of Lovers. 250 certainly made the colonel uneasy. He had been chafing at the length of the visit on his daughter's account as well as his own. \"I say, let's have a peep at the garden,\" suggested Julia, after a pause. \" The labourer is sure to be away in the fields ; and, if not, we '11 cover our retreat by talking of the weather and the hops.\" Harry Dodd evidently fell in with her whim, for in a moment a dimpled girlish face, with a saucy smile in its eyes, appeared above the wicket-gate, and a young man's followed close behind it. Further concealment was impossible. Col. Tre veldoe stalked gravely towards them, with his dingy gardening trousers brushing the cabbages. For a second or two Julia stared at her father without recognising him ; then her rounded cheeks flushed, her eyes opened wide with astonishment. \" Is that you, daddy ? \" she murmured, in a scared kind of whisper. \" What on earth are you doing here ?\" \"Yes \u2014 it's me,\" the colonel replied rather solemnly. \"I'm afraid you've found me out, my dear.\" Julia raised the latch of the wicket with a falter ing hand, and moved a step or two forward wonder ingly. She was still unable to speak above a whisper :"], [257, "Three Brace of Lovers. 251 \" Father dear, what are you doing here ? *' For reply the colonel held out his arms, and quite disregarding the sardonic gaze of Mr. Dodd, who sat staring at them both from his box-seat, gathered up his daughter as though he would never let her go again, kissing her the while, so that Harry Dodd could hear it from the lane, whither he had retired. \" There, you mus'nt be disappointed, little girl,\" said the old fellow, patting Julia's cheek. \"I know I 've humbugged you a bit ; but I 'm comfortable enough here, and Hugo has been staying with me all the summer.\" \" But, dadd)' . . . Oh, daddy, it 's a mere hovel ! \" Julia burst forth, finding her voice at last, and at once beginning to cry. Harry Dodd heard that sound also through the hedge, and felt a lump rising in his own throat. Mr. Dodd continued to stare as he might have done at a sentimental scene nicely done upon a London stage, growling to himself: \"Oh! her father is he ? I guessed he was a pauper, but he seems to be a fugitive from justice as well ! Fool that I 've been to let the girl stay so long \u2014 there '11 be a row with that young idiot, Harry, now, I suppose ! \" The \"young idiot,\" meanwhile, stood cogitating in the lane, with his back to the garden. He was"], [258, "Three Brace of Lovers. 252 taking stock of the new situation, mainly from the point of view of his own interests. Perfect disregard of self is not a usual quality with men, still less with young men, least of all with young men in love\u2014 and Master Harry had been in that interesting condition for some weeks. Moreover, as a man who took himself seriously, with a strong resolution to get his own way in things great and small, he had arranged in his own mind that love should end in marriage \u2014 if only Julia would have him. His father, in consideration of Miss Treveldoe's reputed good connections, had, so far, taken no step to hinder this creditable little plan ; but the discovery of Col. Treveldoe living in a veritable cottage, and in the guise of a gardener, would doubtless cause Mr. Dodd's neck to stiffen. Thus, there would be his own father to deal with first, and Julia's afterwards. Of the two, Harry was more afraid of the latter. Having heard that Col. Treveldoe was a Cornishman of prodigiously old family, and having at Eton and Oxford learned something of the far-reaching power of birth-pride \u2014 a phenomenon not understanded of his father \u2014 he considered the Treveldoe pedigree a more formid able obstacle than the Dodd purse. But he was quite determined to overcome both, to which end his first step must be the making of Col. Treveldoe's acquaintance."], [259, "Three Brace of Lovers. 253 Accordingly, he joined his father, who was just descending from the waggonette as the Treveldoes disappeared into the cottage, and proceeded to get rid of him. \" You might be arranging the hampers and girls in the boat, father \u2014 I '11 join you in a few minutes,\" he suggested, coolly. Mr. Dodd scowled fiercely upon his son, feeling that the moment was a crucial one. Were he to give in now, Harry would certainly end by trampling upon his wishes. He had a weakness for his only son, and considered him a fit match for the greatest lady in the land. To see Harry going doggedly forward to win the daughter of a half-pay officer in a cottage, was rather more than he could bear. To him the Cornish pedigree meant little, especially now that he had enjoyed a glimpse of the colonel's menage. His indignation increased every moment. \" You come with me,\" he snarled. \" I wont have you fooling about that cottage ! \" \" I 'm going in to make Col. Treveldoe's acquaint ance,\" answered the youth. \" What 's the good of calling on a gardener ?\" \" For God's sake, speak lower !\" muttered Harry, with a scared glance at the cottage. \" Don't you see that every window's open ?\" \" D n it, Harry ; are your old father's wishes to go for nothing ? \""], [260, "Three Brace of Lovers. 254 \"I'm going in to make Colonel Treveldoe's acquaintance.\" \" Come, old boy, I don't often thwart you ; and Miss Treveldoe will doubtless join us again, when she has done fondling the gardener . . . And I'll pack her off to-morrow!\" he added under his breath, \" I 'm going in to make Col \" You shan't, then !\" bawled Mr. Dodd, in a fury. \" If you enter that gate, by the Lord I '11 go in with you, and insult the man to his face ! \" \" If you do,\" said Harry, in a low tone, looking very pale and wicked, \" we shall part, that's all ! If you cross me in the only thing I 've ever cared about, I'll leave home to-night and go off to New Zealand by the next ship that sails. I mean what I say ; you know I'm not given to empty threats ! \" Then Mr. Dodd treated himself to, at a rough guess, about five pounds' worth of swearing ; which meant that he was beaten for the present. He turned away and strode down to the boat, and every member of the party perceived that the day was spoilt. Harry went straight back to the wicket, flung it open, and strode into the garden as though about to storm a breach. He was certainly in a mood fitted rather for fighting than for making himself agree able."], [261, "Three Brace of Lovers. 255 After knocking, he had a moment or two in which to pull himself together ; then Colonel Treveldoe appeared in the low doorway and shook hands with him quite calmly. This simple proceeding was well calculated to damp any smouldering heroics ; the colonel's voice, too, was dry, though perfectly civil. \" Come in and take a seat,\" said the old soldier ; \" that is, if your people won't mind a few minutes' delay.\" \"Don't be concerned on their account, for I'm not going with them, Colonel Treveldoe.\" \"Then you had better tell them so,\" said the elder man shortly, \" at present the whole party is waiting for you. And perhaps you '11 kindly convey my daughter's apologies at the same time ?\" Feeling that he was being treated like a school boy, Harry walked sulkily down the cabbage-garden and peremptorily informed his people that they were not to wait for him. \"I'm glad to see you,\" resumed the colonel tranquilly, when his guest had re-seated himself, \" and I daresay you '11 later on be the bearer of a note from my daughter, thanking your people for their kind hospitality ; for, the fact is, she has made up her mind to cast in her lot with me here in this cottage\u2014 just as I feared.\" \" But I hope she isn't going to leave us yet ? \""], [262, "Three Brace of Lovers. 256 \" I fear so, and hope Miss Dodd will excuse her unconventional departure. You see, I have deceived her as to this little place of mine, and now she has found me out, and is much upset ; so I must humour the child. My cousin Hugo must turn out to make room for her.\" \" But \u2014 mayn't I see Miss Treveldoe to say ' good bye'?\" \" My dear boy, she is at present upstairs in dulging in a good cry, as women like to do in cases of this sort.\" \" But when she comes down again ?\" \"That won't be until you've gone.\" These two men \u2014 the greybeard and the beard less \u2014 looked at one another, and neither seemed inclined for shilly-shallying. \"Colonel Treveldoe, I don't mean to give up your daughter.\" \"But you'll have to, my boy.' \" I know she's of ancient birth, while we 're mere mushrooms from your point of view \" \" Don't mention it,\" said the colonel, drily. \" But let me tell you that, your father's voice being rather \u2014 clear, I couldn't help overhearing what he said in the lane just now. Julia heard it too.\" Poor Harry grew crimson ; his wrath against his father boiled up in such a fashion that it was well the latter was out of reach up the river."], [263, "Three Brace of Lovers. 257 \" I should advise you to take it coolly,\" suggested the old soldier, with that happy knack of saying the most irritating thing possible which is the peculiar gift of commonplace people ; \" though, mind you, I do rather feel for you. Having known my daughter for a few weeks, you of course think yourself mightily in love ? Well, your father doesn't approve, neither do I ; so there's an end ofthe matter. Take your disappointment like a man, avoid this cottage like a pest-house, and in a month or two \" \" But, look here, Colonel Treveldoe \u2014 \"My good fellow, I've done with the subject, and will hear no more about it. I believe you 're good at farming and gardening and all that sort of thing, so perhaps you '11 give me a hint or two about my little piece of ground before you go ?\" \" Oh, d n the garden! ... I beg your pardon, but a man can't pick his words when his feelings are being trampled upon.\" \"A man should \u2014 though I'm bound to say I don't always manage it myself. Come now, do you think those kidney - beans are ready for picking? \" \"I tell you I won't be put aside by anyone ; if only Miss Treveldoe will have me, I'll \" \" But she won't, my good fellow \u2014 that's just the point.

Will you have anything after your drive ? \" \" No, thanks,\" said Harry, miserably. \" Prussic acid's about the only thing to tempt me just at present !\" \" Ha ! ha ! \" chuckled the colonel. \" Then come out and have a look at the beans.\" Harry consented ; anything was better than being sent off the premises at once. He even made an effort to talk and take an interest in the garden, for which his host respected him. The furtive glance or two that he ventured to cast at the upper windows of the cottage brought him no reward ; but, once the tabooed subject was finally dismissed, he found he could get on pretty well with Julia's father. For Colonel Treveldoe, who was much inclined to like the straightforward lad, exerted him self on his side also, and waxed quite talkative, for him, telling old campainging stories of the north-west frontier. \"Ah !\" sighed Harry, \"your's has been a man's life ! We loungers at home live like women. Hunting's the only thing here fit fora man's notice."], [265, "Three Brace of Lovers. 259 But I suppose I mustn't keep you longer. May I come \" \" Let the cottage be as a pest-house ; that's the best advice I can give you. Under other circum stances, I might have been glad to see you ; as it is, why, we shan't meet overmuch.\" \" Good-bye, then, Colonel Treveldoe.\" \" Good-bye, and mind the patch of fresh paint on that gate-post.\" \" He 's a decent enough young fellow,\" said the colonel to his daughter a few minutes later ; \" but, after what we heard from the lane, I shan't have to play the stern parent with you, eh, Ju ? \" \" Certainly not,\" retorted Julia proudly, though with the tears still wet on her face ; \" I will never marry the son of a man who \u2014 who . . .

I must see about an old boat to pull 17"], [266, "260 Three Brace of Lovers. you about in, too, for he'll be wanting his own. And there's the general meeting at the Club to-day, so I may as well attend that also, while I'm about it.

There's your charwoman to pacify, for one thing, for she's very angry at my arrival.\" \"I'll row down to the boathouse directly after lunch, then, Ju.\" The little programme was duly carried out, and Hugo was found at the Club, where he had been lunching with Major Clinton. He laughed a good deal at his cousin's pathetic account of Julia's arrival at the cottage and immediate resolution to stay there. \" I suppose I shall have to change my quarters ?\" he said. \"Just so \u2014 though I 'm not altogether glad to lose you.\" \"You're most flattering, Chief; such a compli ment from you is almost crushing to my modesty. I shall put up at ' The Falcon ' here for a week or two, while I rearrange my plans.\" \" I should advise your getting out of the place altogether,\" suggested old Treveldoe significantly. \"I'm afraid it's too late!\" Hugo murmured gloomily."], [267, "Three Brace of Lovers. 261 \"Ah! I thought you'd be making a fool of yourself sooner or later, Hugo.\" \" Thanks ! the remarks of a candid friend are full of comfort. Have you anything else of a cheering nature to communicate?\" \"Well, I always thought \" But you said that just now, my dear Chief. Your prescience does you credit, I'm sure, but it doesn't help me much at the present juncture. Now, / always thought you made a mistake in letting Julia go to Chesning Grange.\" \"Ah ! hum ! Let's talk about something else,\" muttered the colonel. Hugo chuckled maliciously, and stuck to his point. But the colonel grew very glum, would hardly open his lips any more, and presently pro ceeded to bury himself in a newspaper. Hugo was quite in a mood to make himself disagreeable, but finding there was nothing to be got out of his cousin, who had an admirable gift of stubborn silence on occasion, he adjourned to \"The Falcon\" to arrange about his new quarters. Later in the afternoon the general meeting of the Club took place. Now, it happened that these meetings had latterly become somewhat stormy, owing to certain divisions in the little Club. All the old soldiers and sailors followed Major Clinton \u2014 who, indeed, had"], [268, "262 Three Brace of Lovers. not a single personal enemy, either in his own set or any other \u2014 and opposed to this party was a strong group of local professional men. Some months since, this opposition party had tried to bring in a retired London tradesman, lately settled in the neighbourhood ; whereupon the old soldiers were at once up in arms, and a very pretty quarrel ensued. So much animosity, in fact, had been stirred up, that Major Clinton, who had a constitu tional dislike of all agitations and disturbances, decided not to be present at the general meeting to-day, and resisted all persuasions to the contrary. Towards evening, however, the most genial and popular member of the Club drove in from the country as usual ; and the first thing he heard, upon mounting to the billiard-room, was that his friend Hugo had been put up and black-balled. \"Eh . . .? Wha' . . .?\" he muttered, sinking on to a seat : then added to himself, with a deep, silent chuckle, \"Just as I expected; now I shall score off Jameson and his faction once for all!\" But the Jameson clique seemed to think other wise, for, a pool being just completed, they all gathered round Major Clinton to hear what he would say about it. He was very soon surrounded by all in the room, players and lookers-on, and became the centre of a little forest of grounded cues."], [269, "\"Eh . . . ? Wha' . . .?\" he muttered."], [270, "264 Three Brace of Lovers. \" Very sorry the Club has offered such an indig nity to any friend of yours, major,\" began Mr. Jameson, in a voice spiced with triumph ; \" but some of your friends were rather down on our man as being an ex-tradesman, if you remember, and no one seems quite to know who this Mr. Hugo is. There was a report to the effect that he called him self a photographer; but perhaps you can tell us the rights of the matter ?\" \" Perhaps I can,\" murmured the major languidly, \"but I 've got nothing to smoke \u2014 would somebody kindly ring the bell for me ?\" Half-a-dozen men were ready and willing to perform this service for the kindly major : nor were those who knew him best deceived by his non chalance, but rather inferred from it the speedy demolition of Jameson. There was a hush of expectation while he was lighting his cigar. \" Who is Hugo \u2014 that's the question, eh ? Well, in the first place, he 's an ex-soldier \u2014 late captain in the 25th Lancers.\" \"Ha-ha!\" laughed all the other old soldiers, \" you 'veput your foot into it, haven't you, Jameson ? \" \"Also rather a distinguished soldier \u2014 has won the V.C. and that sort of thing . . .

Wha'? . . . For a moment there was dead silence, then such a chorus of laughter shook the billiard-room as it had seldom or never heard before. \" Lord bless me ! \" muttered Harry Dodd, dropping his cue upon the floor with a crash, \" why, this is the man my sister cut dead in the face of all Chatterby ! \""], [272, "266 Three Brace of Lovers. CHAPTER XVI. S S E T T PYNE and his twin cousins had accomplished a pleasant fortnight's cruise in the Channel, and had brought their 8-ton craft, the Niobe, to anchor in Christchurch Harbour. Nor had this cruise been a mere summer lounge ; for, all three young men being of an energetic order, and the twins being possessed of one of the healthiest of Young England's crazes, to wit, that of practical yachting, they had taken but one paid hand to cook and clean for them, doing all the seamanship themselves. The weather, on the whole, had been tamer than they would have chosen ; but yesterday the old Niobe had received a good \" dusting \" in a summer gale outside the Needles, which had braced them up nicely, and made them not disinclined for a short spell in the harbour. Also they had arranged to call at Christchurch for letters ; and the brothers pro posed to take the opportunity of running over to Southampton to see to the completion of the Mad Lass, a new racing ten-rater, which was to give much sport, and win a bouquet of cups next season. The Niobe worked up the narrow tortuous"], [273, "Three Brace of Lovers. 267 channel leading into Christchurch Harbour about dawn, with the young flood to help her, and came snugly to an anchor over against the silver sand hills. Then, immediately after breakfast, the brothers jumped into the punt, and were rowed away to the town by old Tom, their paid hand, leaving Bissett to contemplate the scenery, and wonder how things were going on at Chatterby. Bissett lay on the deck, basking in the sun, gazing over the sheen of still waters and the peaceful greenery of marsh-lands dotted with red cattle, above which rose that ancient Priory Church, which every second landscape painter in England has transferred to canvas. Around him wheeled the sea gulls, snow-white and glossy grey, while over the pale sand-hills, with their pencilling of delicate green herbage, the bay gleamed darkly blue. Bissett drank it all in luxuriously, and was presently minded to fall a-castle-building. This was, doubtless, in his circumstances, mere foolishness ; yet it may be urged, by way of excuse, that, just as he was starting for his holiday, a certain vague lightening of his horizon had taken place ; that is to say, he had heard from an old college friend named Mackenzie, who, failing to make a fortune as rapidly as his ambition demanded, was bethinking himself of military tutoring. His plans were at present hazy ; but, were he to succeed in"], [274, "268 Three Brace of Lovers. getting command of the necessary capital, would Pyne, with his practical experience of the trade, be inclined to join him in setting up an establishment ? And was there an opening for such an experiment in Chatterby itself? These were the cardinal points of Mackenzie's letter. Bissett answered the questions in a hopeful vein ; he thought a small establishment, on very different lines to those of Beechgrove, might certainly be started in Chatterby. Mulliner's men came, for the most part, from a distance ; a genuinely local cram mer need not interfere with him at all. Mackenzie, too, was a pushing, energetic fellow, who would put his whole heart into the work ; and, with a man of this sort as colleague and backer, Bissett fancied the tutorial treadmill might become a fairly workable machine, and better still, a paving one. For this was the consummation now most to be desired \u2014 a good income. He had arrived at the point to which most of us, in despite of all higher aspirations, touch upon sooner or later, when the acquisition of mere lucre becomes the paramount aim. No ardent young city man just entering upon a business career could be keener to rake in gold than was Bissett Pyne at this period. Literary ambition was dead in him for the present ; literary art had yielded its high place in his estimation to the more fascinating one of money-making ; the pen was now a contemptible"], [275, "Three Brace of Lovers. 269 tool, not worthy the handling of a man who had a real stake to play for. One of the bad features of poverty is that it has power to rob even so ethereal a thing as romantic love of its true spiritualising function, converting even a man of generous aims into a sordid calculating fellow, across the door of whose con sciousness is written, by way of warning to all unworldly imaginings : \" No admittance except on business.\" However, if Mackenzie's letter demoralised him somewhat, it certainly gave Bissett a little much needed hope, which had been carefully nursed during the cruise, and was still in a good healthy condition. As he lay idling upon the deek, this new hope was stirring his young blood irresistibly. Under its potent stimulus his castle-building progressed rapidly. He took a suitable house just outside the town, entered into partnership with Mackenzie, secured the nucleus of an establishment ; increased it rapidly ; prospered steadily ; and lastly, in one fine leap of sanguine anticipation, stood ready and able to \u2014 take a very desperate step indeed. Very probably a letter from Mackenzie would be awaiting him at Christchurch ; he looked eagerly up the river for the return of the Niobe's punt. At length that cockleshell appeared, rounding the"], [276, "Three Brace of Lovers. 270 last marshy point, where gulls and redshanks were strutting and pattering on the tidal mud. Old Tom was dipping his sculls lazily, as though anxious youth and hot impatience were things not dreamed of in his philosophy. Making a sweep, so as to stem the tide, he presently dropped alongside the Niobe, whistling gently. \" Any letters, Tom ? \" \" Why, yees, Mr. Pyne, I think there be one or two. The wind 's backin' ; a' think we shall have a puff from \" \"Where are the letters?\" \" For'rard there, sir, in one o' my coat pockets; that bank to the s'uthard, now \" \" Pass up your coat, man alive !\" In a twinkling Bissett had clutched the coat, scattered his letters on the deck, and was opening one from Mackenzie. \" Good man, excellent Scot ! \" He quite fell in with Pyne's views, would be able to raise the necessary funds, and hoped to get the modest little establishment fairly under way by next Easter. Bissett heaved a sigh of relief; at last his long period of slack-water seemed drawing to an end, and the murmuring of the rising tide was becoming audible. \" Have a glass of beer after your pull, Tom ?\""], [277, "Three Brace of Lovers. 271 \" Well, I am a bit dry, sir ; 'twas stiff work pullin' agen that flood.\" The gentleman's mood was one well calculated to make corks fly. Old Tom hoped there might be another batch of letters later on in the day. The stout 8-tonner was, indeed, too small to contain Mr. Pyne's buoyant spirits ; he found it necessary to jump into the punt, and pull himself ashore with the letters. Then he darted swiftly up the miniature mountain-range of sand, and threw himself down upon the summit. Lying luxuriously upon his back, with the blue waters at his feet, and the white cliffs of Alum Bay peeping through sunlit haze, he opened a letter in his mother's handwriting, the only one which bore the Chatterby postmark. The letter was brief, loving, and tender, It con tained but one piece of news \u2014 that of Delicia's engagement to Hugo."], [278, "Three Brace of Lovers. 272 CHAPTER XVII. HE announcement of Miss de Ribeau's engagement was far from taking Chatterby by surprise ; in fact, that little community boasted, not without justice, that no event of this nature ever was sprung upon it unawares. The relations between families were too intimate, life in general too public, and affairs of the heart too deeply interesting to permit of betrothals growing up, snow - drop - fashion, in quiet, out - of - the - way corners. Before ever a tender glance was ex changed Chatterby would have its eye Upon any brace of potential lovers, and be exercising its tongue about the pros and cons of the affair ; insomuch that very shy young men seldom dared to fall in love before first putting thirty or forty miles of distance between themselves and these lynx-eyed Arcadians. On the whole, the Chatterby public was well pleased on this occasion. Having latterly been on the look-out for the appearance of a butterfly of some kind from the Hugo chrysalis, it was satisfied with the emergence of a live lord, whose engage ment to their only peer's daughter seemed also"], [279, "Three Brace of Lovers. 273 natural and appropriate. Major Clinton, as claiming a certain proprietorship in the engagement, was especially gratified, though perhaps more com plaisant at the defeat of the Hybrids than circum stances quite warranted, seeing that young Harry's perversity had made their attack a forlorn hope from the first. It is easy to defeat an army whose leader and champion declines to move a step from his tent. Upon paying a visit of congratulation to Mrs. Pyne, the honest major was vexed at finding her less jubilant than himself. Not that she threw cold water upon the affair, or, indeed, said anything of which he could justly complain ; but there was a note of doubt and hesitation in all her comments. He had counted upon finding her relieved on Bissett's account ; and doubtless, as a sensible woman, she should have been. But the mother in her was stronger than the woman of sense, and her relief was too slight to wax eloquent about. There was some comfort in the knowledge that Bissett had kept his secret so well as to be in no danger of public condolence, yet it was no slight trial to have to send him a piece of news so destructive of his hopes. Nor, putting her son aside, did the engage ment meet with Mrs. Pyne's real approval. She was well assured that it was one of honour alone on the part of Lord St. Mellion ; and Delicia, with her 18"], [280, "Three Brace of Lovers. 274 usual frankness, made no pretence whatever of the existence of any romantic affection on her side. \" I presume that he cares for me,\" she remarked, naively enough, \" or he wouldn't have asked me to marry him. And certainly it's a better match than I could have hoped for, auntie, with only \u00a380 a year to recommend me \u2014 don't you think so ?\" Aunt Sybil had somehow hoped for a different attitude on Delicia's part, though upon Hugo's con duct, at any rate, she could look with approval. After going so far, he had certainly done what was right in making her niece an offer ; and he seemed resolved to loyally accept a situation for which he had only himself to thank. He was now quartered at \" The Falcon ; \" and having sent for his tandem-cart and couple of horses, he occupied himself with driving his fiancee out every day, and in otherwise discharging the duties of his position. In no wise was he remiss or backward in his attentions ; the affair went smoothly along without a hitch, like a well-rehearsed play, and from the ordinary spectator's point of view the players looked nice and spoke their lines easily. There was positively nothing to break the mono tonous propriety of the new engagement. The earl and countess wrote letters of welcome and formal invitations for thc autumn to the son's betrothed, and Lord Hengist congratulated his sister with"], [281, "Three Brace of Lovers. 275 almost pathetic cordiality upon a piece of good fortune so little to be looked for amid the wilds of Chatterby. Meanwhile Delicia indulged in dreams of social triumphs to come, and was doubtless conscious of deserving all her brother's praises. Happily, her vanity, or the absence of any sentiment on her own part, completely blinded her as to the actual condition of Lord St. Mellion's feelings. As for Hugo himself, he felt that he had in sober truth become Lord St. Mellion again \u2014 a common place blasi man of the world, with a certain set of duties to be got through, but without a wish or a hope worth mentioning. The apotheosis of the philosopher was complete ; Hugo, the genial idler, with his grievances, his idyllic tendencies, his enjoy able melancholy, was no more. After each day's driving and calling and punctilious attendance upon his fiancee, he would return to his hotel a shade more downcast than before. He often met Lady Marsh now at different houses, for she made a point of not seeming to avoid him. As far as he could tell, Constance regarded him as an old friend in whose welfare she took a kindly interest. She even had Miss de Ribeau to spend a few days at Ashlands, a piece of good nature that jarred heavily upon poor Hugo \u2014 and may have been a not unmixed pleasure to herself. But 18 *"], [282, "Three Brace of Lovers. 276 for his insane perversity, how different things would have been ! Verily that quarrel at the picnic had been his crowning folly, but for which the proposed idyl might now be in full swing. Instead of these weariful drives along dull country roads, with nothing to support him but Delicia's dull prattle \u2014 for he did find her dull, there was no blinking the truth when discussing her with himself \u2014 he might have been sculling up to Ashlands lock in the twilight, and . . . and . . . Oh, fool, fool ! \u2014 perverse, ungrateful, freakish fool that he had been ! Our crushed philosopher had a companion in misfortune, too \u2014 Harry Dodd was also putting up at \" The Falcon \" at this period. Probably, after that scene at Colonel Treveldoe's cottage, he could hardly trust himself at home, feeling that the con sequent family bickering must needs tend to the cutting off of what little hope was left of a final arrangement between his father and Julia's. Mean time he entered into correspondence with an old friend who was about to take up farming in New Zealand, and took care that his father should be informed of this. Unhappily, too, for Mr. Dodd's policy, Harry was independent of him, at least in so far as keeping himself comfortably as a bachelor went. If he chose to settle down with his friend at the Antipodes there was nothing to prevent his doing so, which gave an alarmingly realistic air to"], [283, "Three Brace of Lovers. 277 his proceedings. His fatherwas veritably frightened ; and, without actually sending either line or message to Harry, he ordered the girls to see him frequently, and be very sympathetic about his plans. The two unfortunates used to dine together of an evening \u2014 somewhat luxuriously, too \u2014 for \" The Falcon's \" cook had a pretty talent \u2014 -yet withal gloomily. Hugo had by now acquired a special loathing for the innocent little town ; its freshness had vanished, its novelty had turned to utter stale ness, the whole idyll was in ruins. Once or twice a week he would shake off the dust of Chatterby from his feet, and run up to Town. When neither in the train nor on duty, his only amusement consisted in lolling at his sitting-room window, watching for Constance Marsh's carriage ; he would spend hours over this fruitless pastime. Even Harry Dodd, despite his kindred lowness of spirits, was a nuisance to him, as necessitating the keeping up of a certain mock cheerfulness. After the first week or two of excitement, more over, the vigour of Delicia's spirits was somewhat abated. As soon as she had time for quiet con sideration of them, one or two things began to cause her uneasiness. Her engagement was \"all right,\" as she vaguely phrased it ; Hugo was a calm but dutiful lover \u2014 in fact, just such an one as was most desirable under the circumstances. And surely the"], [284, "278 Three Brace of Lovers. circumstances were altogether creditable ? She had done so well for herself as to elicit the warm approval even of Aunt Longhurst,who, on the strength of this well-doing, had gone to the extent of renewing friendly relations with her niece. Nor had she at anytime unduly encouraged Lord St. Mellion. He had taken an evident fancy to her soon after Major Clinton's picnic, and his attentions had been marked almost from that date. No, there was nothing on her conscience in this connection. Aunt Sybil, again, was as kind as ever ; yet Delicia felt somehow that she had sunk a little in her aunt's estimation: and there was another person whose respect for her would not be increased by this judicious engagement. In a week or two this per son would be back from his yachting cruise. Delicia rather wished the weeks were months \u2014 yet why should she dread his return ? She knew why, but had hitherto staved off admitting it even to herself. The truth was, she was conscious of having seriously encouraged Bissett, of having taken such pains to make him fall in love with her as, had they been bestowed upon an eligible man like Lord St. Mellion, would have been un pleasant to reflect upon. Even as it was, recollec tion brought blushes. It was rather hard upon Bissett to play with him in this manner. He was always so desperately in earnest ; also \u2014 as she freelv"], [285, "Three Brace of Lovers. 279 admitted \u2014 he was a truer, stauncher, less pliable man than Hugo; and being of this steadfast, old fashioned sort, she ought to have thought twice before practising upon him. How would he take it ? Certainly he would not upbraid her; but rather would conceal his mortification by every possible means She rather wished he were a feebler sort of man, to whom she might show herself pitiful and tender, and so win a measure of self-comfort. He had written a kind letter of congratulation, which still lay in her desk unanswered. Oh yes, he would certainly be friendly ; but she disliked the thought of having given him pain \u2014 and still more the probability of his secretly despising her. But, despite her wishes, the earth continued to rotate at its usual speed, the close of the holidays drew on, the little town, in expectation of the returning tide of schoolboys, awoke from its lethargy \u2014 and Bissett returned to Beechgrove for the last term he was to spend there."], [286, "280 Three Brace of Lovers. CHAPTER XVIII. I S S E T T returned to his work at Beechgrove in a mixed frame of mind. He was a good deal crushed, no doubt, and to himself fully admitted the truth ; but his disappointment, pure and simple, was not of sufficient bulk to fill up his mind to the exclusion of all else. Mackenzie's letters had made him foolishly sanguine, but that was an abnormal state with him ; previous ex perience had made of disappointment a figure so familiar that he had come to look for its appearance as a matter of course. Though hidden from view for a time, he knew it must needs crop up again, sooner or later, somewhere in his line of sight. But beyond the mere sense of frustrated hope, there was deep mortification. The conviction that Delicia had been wantonly playing with his feelings rankled sharply ; and the thought of having given his heart to a girl who had, as he considered, deliberately taken herself to market, and sold herself to the highest bidder, was a bitter pill for him to swallow. He was not a vain man ; but as a proud and self-respecting one, he felt that Delicia had proved herself altogether unworthy"], [287, "Three Brace of Lovers. 281 of him. He scorned himself and his late aspirations, vowing that, were Delicia to break her engagement to-morrow, and were he himself to come in for ten thousand a year, he would not waste another glance upon her. Here was no case of undue pressure ; there had been no match-making mamma to preach her down with \"a little hoard of maxims,\" \u2014 she had done the business herself, concluded the bargain like any other tradeswoman ; and probably she would never regret the step. In the ordinary course of things, she was destined to be a countess, and there was not an aspiration in her which a coronet would not satisfy. So much for Delicia herself; with her future husband he was even more deeply disgusted. Hugo, he was confident, had been aware of his feeling towards his cousin, and had deliberately undertaken the task of cutting him out \u2014 Hugo, who but a few weeks since had been bemoaning himself for the loss of Lady Marsh. What a thin-hearted, feeble, drifting creature the man must be ! In truth, Bissett was not very good at making allowances for people ; he was rather hard on Hugo, and failed to realise that his own practical renunciation of his cousin had not unnaturally given her a fillip in another direction. But, whatever his private conclusions might be, he must now meet the newly-engaged pair, say what was proper in the"], [288, "282 Three Brace of Lovers. way of congratulation, and, above all, keep his own mortification to himself, though, unfortunately, he was even less an adept in the art of conventional hypocrisy than in that of allowing for human weak ness. On the whole, he had a very pressing inclina tion to stick like a leech to the once-hated Beechgrove, and put off his first visit home until, say \u2014 the Greek Kalends. Yet, when Saturday came round without bringing her son down the river, and Mrs. Pyne made no complaint, her self-denial made Bissett uneasy. The thought of her disappointment pricked him the more because she said nothing about it. By Tues day he had begun to be sorry for her as well as for himself; by Thursday morning he had resolved to make the plunge at the end of the week. The intervening days passed more quickly than he liked ; but Bissett was not much given to changing his mind, and twelve o'clock on Saturday found him stepping into his sculling-boat at Winkleigh, grimly determined to go through with the trouble, and have done with it. Nor did the task become much easier for being boldly faced. The well - known landmarks, as he shot past them, the lock-gates with their inevitable loungers, and the old piles where the big pike always lay, seemed to rake at his memory, and bring up past scenes, for the express purpose of mocking him. It"], [289, "Three Brace of Lovers. 283 was vexing to discover what power familiar objects had to reproduce thoughts and emotions which he had unconsciously printed upon them. The sculler, indeed, grew more nervous and irritable with every stroke he pulled, until every trifling vexation took the colour of tragedy. When some small boys who were standing about the brink of Ashlands Lock cheered him ironically, he took"], [290, "284 Three Brace of Lovers. it quite seriously and bitterly, and with difficulty mustered a laugh at his own absurdity. Below the lock, however, there occurred a little incident of a more soothing nature. As he passed the creek, upon which was placed the Ashlands Court boathouse, he perceived three or four boats full of fashionable figures just emerging into the main stream. Evidently Lady Marsh had a large house-party again, and was helping them to kill time by a water picnic. The little flotilla, frothing over as it seemed with puffed sleeves, dainty hats, and laced parasols, had a curiously vivifying effect upon the quiet river ; and in the midst of the lively throng Bissett caught a glimpse of Lady Marsh herself. For a second her eyes met his. She was talking rapidly, and wore a fixed conventional smile ; but Bissett felt intuitively that she was really in the same case as himself, and that this one touch of nature made a kinship between them. Thus he acquired a little of that quasi-consola tion which human selfishness gathers from the knowledge that its ill-fortune is shared by another. But, once among the flat meadows of Chatterby, he relapsed heavily ; and when he at length pulled slowly up to the boathouse raft, his spirits had sunk to below zero again. Instead of making his appearance in the state of serene good-nature which his pride demanded, it"], [291, "Three Brace of Lovers. 285 seemed likely that he would achieve nothing better than the sickly kind of jauntiness which must needs betray him rather more effectually than the frankest dejection. Glancing furtively round, he could see no one but the boat-boy, and drew his feet out of the stretcher strap with a sigh of relief. Yet this satisfaction was short-lived, for, as he stepped on to the raft, the very man whom he least desired to meet came down the steps of the Club dressing-room. Hugo sauntered easily towards him, while Bissett heartily wished himself at the Antipodes. The little speech of congratulation which he had worked up to the neatness of a newspaper paragraph, though still somewhere in his system, was yet a long way from the tip of his tongue. He had got his cue, and knew his lines, yet couldn't get one of them uttered. His friend, however, greeted this embarrassed tutor as though they had met the day before yester day, nothing particular having occurred in the inter val, and began at once to talk about a certain south coast regatta, at which Bissett and his cousins had been present. Bissett clutched at the topic, and metaphorically whisked behind it, feeling much as though he were under fire, and had first secured a good bank of earth for shelter. He waxed amazingly eloquent about the"], [292, "286 Three Brace of Lovers. Studmouth Regatta, which, judging from the amount of description it called forth, must have comprised some of the finest matches ever sailed in the Channel. Hugo observed him shrewdly, at first making no attempt to stem the tide of words. But when the skiff had been taken out of the water, and Pyne was standing about in an indecisive kind of way, Hugo took his arm with a kindly smile, saying : \" You 've got something like a grudge against me, old fellow ; come for a stroll in the meadows, and let us try and work it off.\" The man's friendliness was irresistible. Bissett stalked off with him, wishing he could feel more generously towards the philosopher who had cut him out. Now Hugo had no thought at this moment of crudely pouring forth his troubles ; but he had been very solitary lately, with not a soul to comprehend or sympathise with his situation, and he had a genuine desire not to be thought meanly of by a man whom he liked and respected. Without committing himself at all, he thought it might be feasible to give Bissett, by a quiet hint or two, a fairer impression of his conduct than could be gathered from the general look of things. \"Your cousin is somewhere along the river-bank,\""], [293, "Three Brace of Lovers. 287 he said, as they marched off through a field-gate. \" I was detained this afternoon. She agreed to take a book and await me close at hand. I must go in search of her presently, but let us have a short stroll together in the meantime.\" The river was looking its worst at this time of the year, with its water shrunk by summer drought, and so disclosing unsightly mud-banks ; its rich meadows shorn of their garniture, save for a fringe of loose strife left by the scythe here and there in corners overhanging the water. It was blazing hot ; the stagnant water looked thick and unattractive ; trees and bushes drooped ; a warm reddish mist brooded over, and half concealed, the low hills and distant woods. \" Piping weather, isn't it ?\" suggested the tutor. '\u2022' Don't talk about the weather, Bissett, and don't be so infernally distant. Can't you address a man by his name, as you used to do ?\" \" Well, I'm told you've changed your \u2014 \" I've changed nothing, my good fellow \u2014 except a mock-melancholy for a real one.\" Here was confession plain and plump, not to be misread by a child. But the speaker couldn't help it ; he had not Pyne's stoicism, and speak he must \u2014 - to somebody. \" I 'm down on my luck, Bissett,\" he continued, ruefully, \"and that's the truth of it. I was always"], [294, "Three Brace of Lovers. 288 a perverse fool, and Nemesis has overtaken me a last.\" \" You seem to forget \" No, no ; I forget nothing, my good fellow. I know perfectly well that I 'm talking to Delicia's cousin. But don't imagine I'm mean enough, or unjust enough, to attach the smallest blame to her; though I do want you to see that I 'm not the shabby fellow you take me for. In my place, you'd be too high and mighty to care about righting yourself; but, hang it, I'm made of flesh and blood! Besides, as you're not a fool, you're bound to discover that we don't care a rap for each other ; it would be mere affectation to think of making any secret of that. Your cousin is everything that she should be \u2014 understand that ; and our engagement is probably pretty much on a par with most others, without pretence of romantic sentiment on either side \u2014 and I daresay our married life will be all the smoother in consequence.\" They had by this time reached the end of the first meadow, and were skirting along a wide ditch or creek shaded by heavy alders, among which stood out a grand old ash-bole, withered, hoary, and almost branchless. Making for this decaying monarch of the meadows, they halted, and proceeded to lean their backs against it, sheltered by the encompassing alders."], [295, "Three Brace of Lovers. 289 \" I can't, for the life of me, make out,\" said Bissett presently, \" how you managed to get your self into this false position ?\" \" My dear fellow, you're all steel and whalebone, and don't understand a man like me. I tell you, there's a certain amount of wax in my composition, which circumstances are apt to melt at times. Can't you see that I fell into flirtation out of sheer pique and \" cussedness,\" and then found I had gone too far for honourable retreat ? Psha ! the situation is the commonest of the common ; nor is there the least hope of mending it. I have no thought of that, and of course what I have told you is in most sacred confidence. I shan't pester you with complaints any more, however ; I ought not to have done so at all, but I hate to have you thinking so meanly of me.\" \" I don't,\" said Bissett warmly. \" I respect your motives, Hugo, now that I understand them, though I presume there's nothing to be done?\" \" Nothing whatever. I wouldn't have Delicia know the truth for all I'm worth. I've made my bed, which is a loveless match, and must lie on it.\" As he said this a sound like the rattle of an oar came from the bush-fringed creek at their backs. \" There 's someone lounging in a boat under the alders, I suppose,\" said Bissett; \"it's as well that we spoke low. Shall we go and see who it is ? \" As the sound of oars continued, thev followed it J9"], [296, "Three Brace of Lovers. 290 along the bank to an opening in the bushes, when, to their great surprise, Delicia herself appeared, punting a light skiff along the muddy creek. For a moment Hugo's flesh crept ; if she had chanced to overhear his words, how would he ever survive it ? Her first words, however, reassured him. \" How are you, Bissett ? \" she began. \" I 'm glad to see you back again. Did you have a good time with the Niobe?\" \" Capital, thanks. Are you coming ashore ? \" \" Yes\u2014 I got into this boat to practice my sculling, but felt so like upsetting in the open water that I pushed into this creek, intending to leave the skiff here and walk back across the meadow.\" Hugo helped her ashore with the anxious solici tude which comes of a pricking conscience. \" You really shouldn't venture out alone in so light a boat,\" he murmured ; \" it isn't at all safe.\" \" Oh, I 'm all right ! There was no actual danger of upsetting, but it takes nothing to make a woman nervous.\" Then for a moment or two there was an awkward silence. Hugo was still too much scared to be able to face his betrothed without discomfort, though Bissett was observing her curiously. She seemed to be hesitating about something, and was fumbling awkwardly with a diamond ring on her engaged"], [297, "Three Brace of Lovers. 291 finger. When she spoke again her voice was less firm, though quite resolute in tone. Drawing off the ring after a brief pause, she turned to Hugo, and said, blushing deeply : \" I 'm sorry to give you pain \u2014 but I wish to return your present.\" Hugo paled, falling back with an unconsciously dramatic gesture. Bissett turned to walk aside, but she stopped him. \" Don't go, Bissett. It is much better to do it quietly and without any fuss ; and I can say it more easily to you than to him. I couldn't help over hearing the last few words of your conversation ; they reached me before I quite recognised the voices. I was lying half asleep in the shade. I can only regret having up to that moment so deeply misunder stood Lord St. Mellion ; but, happily, this accident has made all straight.\" \" I cannot accept \u2014 \" muttered Hugo, but could get no further. He was offered what an hour ago he would have considered a priceless boon \u2014 his liberty; yet was at this moment more poignantly wretched than he had been in his life. He stood, with hanging head, staringat the ring in hand, and muttering inaudibly. The situa tion was rather a heavy strain upon all three of them. Bissett spoke next in a subdued voice : \" Suppose I take you back in the boat now, 19 *"], [298, "Three Brace of Lovers. 292 cousin ? Then you and Hugo can talk this over at some other time, when \" \"There's nothing to talk over,\" said Delicia firmly, though she had become as white as Hugo. \" It is all at an end between us. I wish Lord St. Mellion to understand that clearly.\" She moved a step or two towards the boat, with Bissett following her, then turned suddenly and rejoined her late fiance'. Bissett looked away, but could not help hearing what followed. \" I wish you wouldn't distress yourself so deeply, Hugo,\" \u2014 she spoke very kindly, with a slight break in her voice \u2014 \" truly you have nothing to upbraid yourself with ; nothing could have been more con siderate and more honourable than your treatment of me. Let us shake hands, and think of each other without any bitterness ? \" Then Bissett heard the rustle of her skirts again, and found himself handing her into the boat. \"Take me up the river,\" she murmured, \"we needn't return to the boathouse yet.\" He was pleased, and it must be admitted, some what surprised, at his cousin's generous attitude towards Hugo ; nor did he fail to admire her present stoicism. But poor Delicia's stock of the latter virtue was expended for the nonce ; his next remark gave the finishing stroke to her self-control. \" You've always called me a hard critic, Delicia,"], [299, "Three Brace of Lovers. 293 and I believe you're right ; but even so hard a judge as I can find no fault with your magnanimous \" There \u2014 he had done it now. Delicia burst into tears before he could finish his sentence. The only thing he could think of was to row swiftly into the mouth of the next side-stream, and ensconce her safely among the bushes. \" To think how he has been tied to me all this time unwillingly \u2014 just for honour,\" she sobbed, \" getting more and more depressed \u2014 as I see, now that my eyes are opened.

ELL, Julia, how do you like life in a cottage, now that you 've given it a fair trial?\" Hugo had just landed at the bottom of the cottage garden, and found his cousin seated upon the river-bank reading a novel ' \" Oh, it isn't bad, though daddy will persist in saying I mope. That's nonsense; I do nothing of the sort. But what has brought you up here, Hugo ? You don't often honour us with a visit ; and, now I come to think of it, why are you so cheerful ? Have you left the dismals behind for once ? \" \" Don't be alarmed for my pessimism, I shall always have that to comfort me,\" quoth Hugo, looking uncommonly cheerful. \"That's humbug; I don't in the least believe in you. How's Delicia ?\" \" She has just gone away to Southampton with her aunt.\" \" Indeed ? Have you managed to quarrel with her, then, in your usual style ?\" \" Little girls should be more respectful, my dear. Talk about yourself, instead of me ; I want to hear how you're getting on ?\""], [302, "296 Three Brace of Lovers. \" Well, I 'm also going away for a week or so, though only as far as Ashlands Court. I 've known Lady Marsh for a long time. She used to come to our school in Paris to see her younger sister, Fanny; and she has been very kind to me here lately. Daddy likes me to go there, too, for there's no chance of meeting anyone particular ... I know all about Lady Marsh,\" she added significantly, \"and how abominably the world has treated her.\" \" When do you start for Ashlands ?\" \" Some time this afternoon.\" \" Look here, Julia \u2014 between ourselves \u2014 I rather want to see Con Lady Marsh.\" \" How dare you say that ? \" she broke out hotly. \" I tell you I wish to see her,\" he repeated quietly. \" Then I shan't help you \u2014 be very sure of that ? \" \" I think you will, Julia.\" \" No, I shan't then ; so there !

I never can make you out ?\" \" Supposing I were no longer engaged ; how then?\" \"You've broken it off: you've quarrelled with poor Delicia! Cousin, I hate you!\" \"Yes, it is broken off,\" said Hugo gravely, \"and"], [303, "Three Brace of Lovers. 297 I fear that tattling little town knows all about it by now. Be very sure, however, that no particle of blame rests upon Delicia \" \" I should think not ; you needn't fear that I shall blame her !\" \"You're quite right, Julia.' \"And now you mean \u2014 \"And now I mean to be the happiest dog in existence,\" put in Hugo, half rising from the grass upon which he had stretched himself, and looking earnestly at his cousin. \" I begin to see \u2014 how it has been.\" \"You're no true woman if you don't jump at some conclusion or other, though most likely it is a wrong one. But if you're the amiable cousin I take you for, you'll keep it a dead secret for the present ; and perhaps towards evening you might suggest to your hostess that a stroll down to the river would be pleasant ? There's a woodland path leading to the Ashlands boathouse \" \" I daresay there is,\" retorted Julia saucily, \"but it doesn't interest me in the least. I don't mind helping lame dogs over stiles, but I won't have any thing to do with tiresome, perverse, unthinking dogs, who care for nothing but quarrelling \u2014 and poaching.\" But the speaker's eyes belied her words ; it was clear that she was only less eager than Hugo himself for the projected bit of romance."], [304, "298 Three Brace of Lovers. \" You had better be civil,\" he laughed, \" for some day I might be persuaded to try my hand upon a brace of obdurate parents.\" \" Oh, nothing will ever come of that,\" murmured Julia, blushing prettily. \" I suppose not. The Duke of Chesning has other views ; and the young Lord Harry is about to colonise.\" \" Is \u2014 is that report true ?\" \" Well, I ought to know ; he has been living at \" The Falcon \" all this time, and though he 's a dull enough fellow, I had to fraternise with him.\" \"You're the most aggravating of cousins ; I wish you 'd jump into your boat and depart. \"All right ; since you won't help me, I shall go Waving his hand casually, Hugo walked down to his skiff and stepped in. \"Cousin Hugo!\" \" What's the matter, now?\" \" I '11 do what I can.\" \" Very well ; see that you don't disappoint me.\" \"Hugo!\" \" Well ? \" \"Nothing.' \" Good-bye, then \u2014 the youth sails next week. \"Oh, Hugo!\" \"It's a shame to bully you, child; he's not"], [305, "Three Brace of Lovers. 299 thinking of leaving before Christmas \u2014 there. And lots of things may happen between this and then. Au revoir, Julia !\" \" Good-bye ; I dislike you less than I did.' Towards evening our restored philosopher might have been seen proceeding up the long reaches of the drowsy river much in his old style. He was in his Canadian canoe, with the violin stowed away for ward ; and was quite himself again, with the old whimsies filling his mind, and just a touch of the old melancholy to give emphasis to his real satis faction. \" The idyll nearly done ?\" he muttered, with the inevitable contrariness of human nature, \" the climax close at hand ? And afterwards the prose again ? Tush ! life has some pretty moments, but is no poem \u2014 at best a decent piece of prose, brightened by a verse-quotation here and there.\" But when the pessimist presently found him self abreast of the cottage, and detected Colonel Treveldoe amongst his cabbages, he startled the latter with a loud \"Gone away!\" which sounded fairly cheerful. \" Hullo!\" muttered the prosaic old fellow, \"it's that lunatic Hugo. . . . Where are you off to?\" he called aloud. \" Going up to look for a volume of poetry that I lost on the south bank some time ago.\""], [306, "Three Brace oj Lovers. 300 \"Psha ! \" growled the colonel, \" Let the nonsense go; you'll be all the better without it.\" \"Ah, but I can't leave it lying about, for my name's written in it \u2014 I hope. Ta-ta, Chief; stick to your cabbages and kidney-beans, they do you credit.\" \"Well, they are pretty good for an amateur's work, I must say.\" \" If I catch sight of Julia by any chance, shall I tell her not to stand about in the evening mist ?\" \"You're not likely to see her, my good fellow.\" \" But I might, you know.\" The colonel growled something inaudible, and the canoeist glided on with flash of paddle in the evening light. Reaching the mouth of \" The Gravels,\" he paused a moment. It was a warm, rich eventide, not unlike that ofthe major's picnic party, save that the breath of autumn was clothing the meads, and all the greenery w-as lustreless. The placid river, flushed with the borrowed amber and rose of the west, had the same languorous charm ; the alders fringing the long, straight reach towards Ashlands melted away with that sense of infinity which comes of long lines meeting in far perspective ; and the lazy cattle were standing about on the very spot where he and Constance had differed and parted. After this brief halt he paddled away into the"], [307, "It was a warm, rich eventide"], [308, "Three Brace of Lovers. 302 gathering mist and seeming infinity, with the sunset throbbing before him, and the peace of Nature's quiet mood hovering in his consciousness. The end of the long reach brought him to the grounds of Ashlands Court. He paused in the deep shadow of the trees ; and taking up his violin, began to play the air of Gounod's \"Ave Maria.\" \" Someone may chance to hear it,\" thought he, \"if only Julia has done her part.\" Someone did hear it ; and sighed as she came down the woodland path, listening to her young guest's prattle. After playing the air once Hugo sat motionless, looking between the alder-boughs along the patch of sward into which the path debouched. Almost immediately he saw a slight schoolgirl's figure emerge, followed by another, taller and many degrees more graceful. For a moment he was con scious of an absurd inclination to paddle away again without declaring his presence. Couldn't it be done more gracefully by letter ? Julia would giggle, he felt certain, and there was something rather ridiculous in the situation. Suppose he were to . . . But at this moment his paddle fell overboard with a splash, and Julia at once detected him. She came forward with a comical look, half-scared and half sentimental, and muttered : \" Come ashore, for goodness sake, and be quick"], [309, "Three Brace of Lovers. 303 about it, for I feel rather mean at entrapping her \u2014 and dreadfully inclined to laugh ! \" \"I thought you'd want to giggle,\" murmured Hugo resentfully. He clambered ashore, by no means gracefully, for a Canadian canoe is a ticklish thing to get out of neatly, and walked slowly towards Lady Marsh. Constance Marsh's heart was beating rapidly. It must have been Hugo who played that air just now ! What could he mean by this unexpected visit ? And why was Julia going off like that, and leaving her with . . . with him ? She was not kept long in suspense, however. Hugo approached her deferentially, and without any conventional preliminaries, began to apologise in simple, frank words for fastening that quarrel upon her at the picnic. \" I hope you '11 forgive me, though I've never had the grace to apologise until now.\" \" But \u2014 but I don't see how it matters \" she said, in a bewildered voice. \"Ah, but it does \u2014 Constance !\" The tall, fair woman flushed uneasily as he pro nounced her name. But Hugo was now too nervous to look at her. They fell to walking slowly along the bank westwards. \" It matters,\" he whispered, \"because I'm free again, Constance, and I want to have your full"], [310, "Three Brace of Lovers. 304 pardon for more than one transgression before before asking you to be my wife.\" Julia glanced back once as she entered the wood. The two figures were still pacing quietly along. They were already some distance from her, and their backs were turned, and they were walking a little apart from one another, yet somehow her romantic instinct was satisfied. \" I may as well go up to the house,\" she whis pered, with a little excited laugh, \"for I'm pretty sure they have both forgotten my existence ! \""], [311, "Three Brace of Lovers. 305 CHAPTER XX. $|\u00a3~llp^) fI term at Beechgrove passed i_!pj||\u00a7||a smoothly enough for Bissett Pyne. His cottage quarters had become, in the r-S__^SjpS\u00ab> absence of the frolicsome McLachlan, a haunt of peace : not once during- the autumn was he driven to the village church as a place of refuge, nor at any time did he find himself harassed by over-pressure to the point of mixing up Euclid and literary disappointment. In the meantime, Mackenzie, his future partner, took a house on the outskirts of Chatterby, and quickly got two or three pupils together. Bissett's other friends, too, were bestirring themselves on behalf of the new firm. Major Clinton, out of sheer good-nature, took up the question of this tutoring establishment as vigorously as he had done of the Tennis Club and other public institutions ; and Lord St. Mellion, upon bringing home his bride to Ash lands late in the autumn, began at once to write to all the likely friends he knew, with a view to recom mending his friend Pyne as an army-tutor. It seemed highly probable that in a few months' time the firm would have captured as many young men as they were likely to have space for. 20"], [312, "Three Brace of Lovers. 306 Yet the least jubilant person connected with the scheme was Bissett Pyne himself. He had longed hopelessly to be quit of Beechgrove, to be his own master, and to make a definite start in life ; and now that his problems were on the eve of solution he felt no more than a mild satisfaction at his good fortune. \" Security is an insipid thing,\" says the old play wright, \"and the overtaking and possessing of a wish discover the folly of the chase\" \u2014 a true enough adage in most cases, since the overtaking of one wish is so apt to demonstrate the higher importance of certain other wishes which have unhappily escaped capture. Thus, upon finding himself the prospective pos sessor of a decent income, with all its contingent advantages, Bissett was troubled with hankerings after the literary career, upon the hope of which this new arrangement must needs put a final extinguisher. He would never more be the recipient of polite editorial regrets, would no more wear his heart out with hoping against hope \u2014 yet he was not satisfied ; the old taint was in his blood still. Before Delicia's engagement this partnership with Mac kenzie had contained some bright possibilities ; but now, somehow, the thing had lost its savour. Her willingness to sell herself\u2014 he put it thus bluntly \u2014 for the sake of a good match, was to him a sufficient"], [313, "Three Brace of Lovers. 307 proof of her inability to settle down happily as the wife of a tutor in a country-town, however successful. He would never dream of inviting her to such a self-sacrifice \u2014 though possibly sore pride had more to do with this decision than he was aware. About Christmas time, moreover, something calculated to nail down his resolution yet more firmly took place \u2014 Delicia came in for some money by the death of a relative. She thus became something like an heiress, at least from the simple Chatterbian point of view. Nor had Bissett much doubt that Aunt Theodora would now once more offer her a home ; in short, that she would in due course return to London \u2014 and the matrimonial market. But, meanwhile, another little affair of the heart, of which we have some knowledge, was taking a favourable turn. Harry Dodd went doggedly on with his colonising preparations, and held no communication with his father. The Duke of Chesning went on going up to town by the morning express, and coming down by the evening one ; but the note of submissive entreaty from his son, of which he was in daily expectation, never reached him. Harry was too prudent thus to commit himself; were he to do so, he knew well that Mr. Dodd would so far relax as to pay a visit of state to Col. Treveldoe, and patronise him, and hint at 20 *"], [314, "308 Three Brace of Lovers. some possible future yielding on his own part \u2014 a course which would certainly set the colonel's back up more rigidly than before. Instead of this, Harry bided his time, venturing upon one or two brief visits to Col. Treveldoe when Julia was known to be away at Ashlands, and never touching upon any topic loftier, or more emotional, than that of gardening. But the situation, he felt confident, was changing for the better from his father's point of view. The gardener-colonel had now a titled relative living close at hand, his daughter was the friend and frequent visitor of Lady St. Mellion ; briefly, a certain halo of aristocracy had come to environ the cottage. The Miss Dodds, too, were extremely anxious to be recognised and invited by the St. Mellions, which gave Master Harry a hold upon them. For, by smoothing their way to a gracious reception at Ashlands, he was able to count upon their good services in return. They did call at Ashlands soon after the bride's arrival, and were met in so friendly a fashion that Miss Dodd thought Lord St. Mellion must have forgotten all about that little episode in the cricket pavilion. At any rate, she was now very willing to assist her brother, and upon approaching her father to that end, found him ready, nay eager, to pay a formal visit to Col. Treveldoe. But Harry, still having serious doubts as to the"], [315, "Three Brace of Lovers. 309 upshot of this experiment, ended by enlisting the good-natured Hugo's interest in the affair to such effect that, when the obdurate parents were at length brought together, it was in the library at Ashlands Court \u2014 an environment better suited than the cottage to the toning down of Mr. Dodd's patronising tendencies. What occurred within the library-doors, no one ever knew precisely ; but if the interview failed to bring about a life-long friendship between two gentle men who tolerated one another with difficulty, it did issue in something much more interesting to the young people. The end of that day found Harry an engaged man ; and, instead of sailing for New Zealand, he returned home in triumph, and drove Julia and his sisters to the great Christmas gathering at Ashlands. During the ensuing holidays Bissett Pyne installed his small family party in a new and com fortable home adjoining the tutorial establishment, and made all due preparations for the coming cam paign. The prospects of the new firm were excellent ; Mackenzie was thoroughly confident and satisfied ; Pyne was less enthusiastic, but quite resolved to do his best. His lot was settled, and he accepted it with philosophic calm. Mrs. Pyne thought her son might have added another and a brighter feature to his lot, but for his own stubborn pride, although she"], [316, "Three Brace of Lovers. 310 had given up hoping for such a consummation. She had set herself from the first moment of Delicia's coming under her care to avoid the smallest inter ference with the young people, and had kept stead fastly to this policy. She had left them to like or dislike one another, to quarrel or to fall in love, just as they pleased \u2014 but none the less did she know pretty clearly how things now stood between them. Of Bissett, it is true, she could not be absolutely certain. Her son was dreadfully proud \u2014 absurdly so, as she could not help admitting \u2014 and betrayed even to her no outward symptom of a tenderness for his cousin. But, with regard to Delicia, she no longer had any room to doubt ; in fact, Bissett had unwittingly taken the only course which could have resulted on her side in a romantic affection of power enough to overmaster social ambition. His stubborn indifference piqued her into caring for him more and more, until the once brilliant Delicia became no hetter than a love-sick maiden. Naturally, poor Delicia's weakness did not tend to lessen her aunt's affection for her. They became inseparable companions, more like mother and daughter than aunt and niece ; and, as Delicia set up a smart little dog-cart, they used to drive out together on the bright March mornings, while Mac kenzie and Pyne were driving the tutorial machine. And so the time wore on until the coy warmth of"], [317, "Three Brace of Lovers. 311 springtide was deepened into the rich, promise of young summer, and all the air of Chatterby was filled with cricketing murmurs. Then a crisis arrived. Delicia received a letter one evening from Mrs. Longhurst, and retired to her room with it immedi ately after dinner. Next morning she came down to breakfast looking thoughtfully solemn, and informed them that Aunt Theodora had given her a pressing invitation for the London season, suggesting at the same time that she might as well say good-bye to Chatterby for good. She would be very sorry to go, she added, but . . . but perhaps it would be better to go for good, if ... if she went at all. Bissett plunged somewhat hastily into the news paper without commenting upon this probable new departure. Mrs. Pyne kissed her niece, and took a seat beside her, as though with a view to hearing all she had to say, but also forbore to offer any opinion of her own. Then Bissett, taking out his watch, said it was time to be off, adding in good-natured cousinly fashion : \" You must talk this over with the little mother, Delicia, and consider what course will be best for your happiness. You know well enough that we shall be . . . However, I must really go \u2014 it has struck ten.\""], [318, "Three Brace of Lovers. 312 So he left them together, Delicia looking pale and depressed, and nestling her hand in her aunt's. At lunch-time he was very talkative and cheerful, but made no further allusion to his cousin's coming departure. But, just as he was starting again, according to his usual routine, Delicia remarked rather timidly : \" I should like to have a last row on the river, Bissett \u2014 as I 'm likely to be going so soon. Will there be any boats out yet ?\" \" The Club isn't open ; but I could probably get hold of a boat, and take you for a pull, when work 's over.\" \" I should like that.\" \" Very good ; then it 's a bargain, Delicia, and perhaps you'll drive me down at four o'clock? You'll join us, mother, won't you ?\" \"I think not, dear; I have some shopping to do.\" This refusal was Mrs. Pyne's first and only breach of her steadfast neutrality ; her heart beat rather quickly as she took this daring step. Bissett was very busy until four o'clock, as busy as he could possibly contrive to be, but the coming boating expedition was present with him all the time ; every two minutes or so he dismissed the subject sternly, only to find it cropping up again immediately afterwards. A last row with Delicia"], [319, "Three Brace of Lovers. 313 was a kind of ... of miserable pleasure, upon which it was impossible not to dwell. When work was over the cousins drove through the town together in brother-and-sister fashion. The little High Street looked bright and cheery ; straw hats and white flannels were appearing here and there, and people were making their way to the Tennis Club for the opening afternoon of the season. There was some difficulty in finding a boat, but Bissett presently secured one just below the town bridge\u2014 the only one that had yet made its appear ance, so they would doubtless have the river to themselves. Delicia had by now learned to steer a boat like a genuine Chatterbian ; she took her cousin through the central arch of the bridge without obliging him to shorten oars. Then they passed under the ancient castle, about which the rooks were cawing and chattering, and so on into the flower-spangled meadows that embraced the lower reaches ofthe river. They hardly exchanged a word meanwhile. Delicia was very pale, and almost in tears ; Bissett looked grim and resolute as ever, but could not trust himself to make conversation. He sculled rapidly and without pause until they reached a point where the river forked, a branch stream entering it from the north through a worm-eaten pair of lock-gates that were now seldom closed."], [320, "Three Brace of Lovers. 314 \" Which way shall we go, Delicia ?\" he asked as they came abreast of the gates. \" Suppose we go no further ? Let us land and climb the high bank, which will give me a good view of the flats and the town. I want to have a last look at them from that point.\" Bissett rowed in accordingly, and handed her ashore upon the promontory between the two rivers. After climbing the steep bank they found them selves in an open alder plantation, richly carpeted with wild hyacinths and starry anemones. On their right was the main river, on the left the branch stream came stealing through the depths of an oak wood ; eastwards, they looked over the flat meadows to where the castle and its rookery rose like a high, wooded island, half concealing the clustering roofs of the town. \" I never imagined how happy I should be there,\" said Delicia, pointing towards the latter. \" I hate leaving Chatterby ! \" \" You 're not absolutely obliged to do so, you know?\" \" No \u2014 but I shall be miserable either way, going or staying.\" \"You'll be happy enough when once you've resumed your old life. The great world is the proper arena for ambition like yours.\" \"I have none left, Bissett ; my old desires have"], [321, "Three Brace of Lovers. 315 gone, I don't know whither. My only ambition now is to be happy.\" \" We all have that much,\" he laughed. \" But my ambition has vanished also \u2014 it lies somewhere at the bottom of the river, in the shape of eight hundred sheets of neatly-written ' copy.' \" \"It seems a pity,\" she commented; \"but I daresay that difficult stroke has saved you ten years of unhappy struggling?\" \" I quite believe it ; nor have I anything to complain of.\" \" I envy you, Bissett ; you have your home, your mother, your routine of duties \u2014 and I suppose you have nothing else to wish for ? \" \" That 's just it ; when the problem of a livelihood is solved, there ensues a period of flatness, and , . But no one is ever satisfied.\" \" Yet you have everything you want ?\" \" I never said so ! \" cried Bissett, irritably. \" What more do you want, then ?\" \" That 's a secret \u2014 and will remain so \" Nothing will get it out of you ? \" \" Nothing.\" \"Then,\" said Delicia, turning aside her white face, \"I shall have to tell you my secret. I don't want to go \u2014 I hate going \u2014 yet . . . there 's only one thing to keep me.\" Bissett paused. He was almost as pale as herself."], [322, "316 Three Brace of Lovers. \" If you were to stay,\" he muttered almost inaudibly, \"you would regret it afterwards. This small restricted life would not satisfy you for long \" \" I can't stay,\" she retorted with a sob, \" because because people are too proud to ask me ! \" \" I don't care to establish my happiness at the expense of yours, dear \u2014 though of course I've cared for you for ever so long, as you know \" \"As I know? Nonsense, Bissett! I know nothing, and don't even believe such a thing. . . . Tell me about it.\" He did tell her about it ; and this stubborn cousin's eloquence, now that his tongue was at last loosened, rather astonished her. She cried quietly while he talked. \" And you still wish to send me away, Bissett ? \" \" My dear, I wish you to do whatever will make for your happiness.\" \"Bissett, you're abominable; you almost force me to propose to you, and now you won't say that you want to keep me here ?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes \u2014 yes ; I do want you to stay. I won't let you go, darling ; you shall stay. Never talk of going again, or I '11 \" \" Oh, Bissett, I 'm so happy ! I shall go on crying for an hour ! Now promise faithfully never to let anyone know that I began it ... \""], [323, "Three Brace of Lovers. 317 They were so still that a thrush returned to her nest in an alder-stump hard by, while her mate resumed his song on one of the upper sprays ; and all the little life of the copse went on as though lovers were one species of the human race from whom there was nothing to fear. How long they were there they never remembered, nor yet how they got down the river again afterwards. The only incident they were ever able to recall was the meeting with Major Clinton at the boathouse. He was standing there superintending the repairs of his punt, and hailed them as they passed. \" Step ashore and tell him, dear,\" whispered Delicia ; \" it is a pleasure to give him good news.\" \" Wha-a-a' . . . ? \" laughed the genial major, when Bissett hinted slily at what had happened. \"Well, this is a surprise, eh? Well done, Bissett \u2014 I wouldn't have believed it of you ! So you 've managed to capture the Princess of Chatterby, old boy ? I always said Chesning shouldn't rob us of her, didn't I ?
