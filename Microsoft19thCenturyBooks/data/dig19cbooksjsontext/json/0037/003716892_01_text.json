For the second day's fight it was divided into two wings, General Polk commanding the right and General Longstreet the left. The main body of the army crossed the Chickamauga at Reed's Bridge and the fords between that point and Lee and Gordon's Mill, on the afternoon and night of the 18th, and formed in the vicinity of and to the north of Hunt's and Thedford's houses for an advance on the Union position at Lee and Gordon's. The battle was, however, unexpectedly opened by Union troops, which by a night march from McLemore Cove had reached the vicinity of Jay's Mill and attacked a portion of Forrest's cavalry which had arrived at that point from Alexander's Bridge. Instead of attacking Critten den's corps at Lee and Gordon's, General Bragg's divisions were dis patched in succession to his right and rear to meet the Union army on its new ground. RIGHT WING. Lieut. Gen. Leonidas Polk. Escort. Greenleaf 's Company Louisiana Cavalry, Capt. Leeds Greenleaf. During the night of the 19th General Bragg divided his army into right and left wings, without regard to corps organizations and having regard only to the positions on the line in which the divisions fouud themselves at the close of the day's fighting. The right wing was commanded by General Polk. It comprised Forrest's cavalry divisions, Armstrong's and Pegram's, and the infantry divisions of Breckinridge, Liddell, Gist (Walker), Cleburne, and Cheatham.
