CHAPTER I. AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. The place was London, the suburb Barnes, the house in a side street, a small and shabby one, only relieved from disheart ening inferiority in every respect by a certain indescribable air of womanly pains and youthful enterprise exercised on its behalf. This was to be seen in the un- blamable cleanness of its window panes, the flawless condition of its window blinds, the old-fashioned country flowers \u2014 car nations, gillyflowers and mignonette, in addition to the stereotyped town gera niums, calceolarias and heliotrope, in its little garden. The season was early VOL. I. 1"], [14, "2 SAPPHIRA. summer, when such a flush of tender green, flaked thickly with apple and chestnut blossoms, was over the land, that it forced its way into the outskirts and even the inner nooks of great towns. The hour was late afternoon, when women's thoughts lightly turn to four o'clock teas, or if they \u2014 the women, not the thoughts \u2014 are too poor for late dinners at seven or eight, to high teas with eggs and mutton chops, and sardines, raspberry jam and marmalade, and the first garden cresses and radishes of the year. The little drawing-room, double as a matter of course, was faded yet fresh, faded as to the melancholy lemon-coloured rep and somewhat battered walnut wood, fresh with the perennial devices of a new generation bent on making the best of things, on dragging into the scene the fashion of the hour, in a Moorish rugs or two and a perilously ingenious arrangement of Japanese fans. These last accessories"], [15, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 3 were matched by the water-colour sketch half-finished on the easel, and the palette, box of colours and array of brushes on an adjoining table ; by the piano littered with loose sheets of music, and by a jar of marsh marigolds. Where and how were they got to gleam like fire, in the room of some tamer flower, in that naturally prim and shabby little drawing-room ? Where and how they were got the next railway station could have told. For there the spoils of the fields and the brooks were brought many a mile by the iron horse to meet the \u00e6sthetic arcadian shepherdess tastes of the period. The company in the room consisted of an elderly and a young woman. The former, wearing a widow's dress and sitting in a low wicker chair, was knitting with a never-ceasing monotony exasperating to some constitutions. The young woman was up and down, out and in, now painting at her easel for ten minutes, 1-2"], [16, "4 SAPPHIRA. now reading for a snatch, now idly waving one of the Japanese fans to and fro, though the heat was not excessive, and again re-arranging the marsh marigolds which needed no re-arrangement. All was done after the manner of a young woman ; indeed, rather more vehemently after the manner than is usual in an age which is balanced very nicely, where girls are concerned, between frantic effort and per petual motion on the one hand and dolce far niente on the other. The mother and daughter were a graphic commentary on the poet's definition : \" The young heart hot and restless, The old subdued and slow.\" Yet was the commentary real or only seeming ? Was the old heart subdued and slow, or was it the more scorchingly hot, the more desperately reckless of the two ? Was it just kept still in the long fever of life by an enforced occupation like that which made the thin bloodless -looking t__"], [17, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 5 hands keep ceaselessly click- clicking the knitting needles, hardly pausing save to draw out one needle and put in another ? What do some quiet domestic elderly women who are never to be seen without an endless, more or less useless, frequently utterly unattractive piece of knitting, or netting, or embroidery, knit or net or em broider into that resource of their declining years ? Does each loop or stitch catch up and hold fast a tender memory, or a stern resolution, or a gnawing regret ? Is such women's work their way of cherish ing the last reflection of the hght of other days, of bracing up their courage to the end, of stamping down care and anguish ? Men would flee from the past in a wild flight over land and sea. They would deaden remembrance by a noisy whirl of out-of-door sports, or a heavy pressure of public engagements. They would drown care in a raging flood of dissipation, or drug it with chloral, or"], [18, "6 SAPPHIRA. with some, to the bodily eyes, still surer and more lasting means of stupefaction. But there are women who have had no choice save to knit or stitch ceaselessly to keep them from crying out in their misery. These two women were mother and daughter, though there was hardly a particle of resemblance between the pair. Perhaps it would have been difficult to trace much resemblance between the elder woman and the member of a younger generation, or to recall clearly how the matron had looked as a maid. It was not that she was so old that every indi vidual trait was lost in a wrinkled mask which stood for age and age alone. She could not have been far above sixtv years, but hers was one of the faces which had blanched and set and grown inscrutable in the struggle of existence. Of course it was possible to draw a few cursory inferences. The nose must"], [19, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 7 always have been aquiline. The eyes could never have been anything else in colour than a greyish blue. The faded complexion showed traces of having been fair, in keeping with the threads of dull golden auburn which lingered among the dead silver of the hair almost concealed by the cap. The pale lips drawn tightly over teeth which were still white and even, and without a gap, must always have been firm lips. But whether they had ever unbent Hke the bow of Cupid ; whether the eyes, which had a certain cold stoniness in them, the result of a score of years' repression of their true meaning, had ever flashed or danced ; the hair, now drawn back in the straightest of narrow braids, ever curled and waved ; the wan, spare cheek ever flushed in rounded softness, not many people would have ventured to say. None of the lady's children could have told. The two elder of the three did remember"], [20, "8 SAPPHIRA. something different in her, something so widely different that it had made an in delible impression even on their childish minds, and they had naturally associated it with their father's death and the family misfortunes which soon after befell them. But whether that former mother, whom they could only dimly remember while still in the pride and prime of life, was blooming and gay like other young wives and mothers, untouched by dire disaster, her only son and her elder daughter could never, somehow, distinctly establish, either to their own or to other people's satisfaction. All they could testify was that their mother, though she might be grave and strict even then, was another woman in those days from what they knew her in later years. The girl wrho was with Mrs. Baldwin in the drawing-room of her house at Barnes was her younger daughter, about twenty one years of age. Georgie Baldwin was"], [21, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 9 rather given to stating the fact, and an nouncing that she wras major, not with any pride either in her age or her inde pendence, rather w7ith a merry ruefulness at having attained such a useless dignity. Other girls wrere allowed to have each her own ball, long before she was twenty-one, on her eighteenth birthday, which was a woman's real majority, when she came out in society and was presented to the Queen, if she were fortunate enough to be entitled to come out and to be presented to her gracious sovereign. All the Scrope girls, Susie and Stella and Sophy, had come out, been presented to her Majesty by the wife of the Lord Lieutenant of their county, and each enjoyed the peculiar glories and delights of her own ball \u2014 granted that it was but a country-house ball of which she was queen. Then there were other girls, like Georgie's own sister Agnes and some of her friends, who had achieved wonders of wrork, written poetry"], [22, "10 SAPPHIRA. and stories \u2014 ay, and sold their lucubra tions to willing publishers \u2014 painted pictures and exhibited them, passed examinations and gained scholarships, if they did not take degrees, and become full-fledged schoolmistresses by the time they were twenty-one. But as for poor Georgie, in her opinion she might as wrell have been twrelve or fourteen. She had received no promotion, basked in no joy befitting her years, neither toiled like a young slave nor by sheer genius done any noteworthy deed, which would have been more to the purpose. In addition she did not believe she would ever do anything worth record ing. She was not sure that the collapse was not in a measure that enthusiastic, provoking Agnes's fault ; but whoever was to blame, there the matter re mained. Georgie Baldwin was a dainty, plump httle girl, a warm red and brown brunette with honest if somewhat round dark hazel"], [23, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 11 eyes, a frank open w7hite forehead un skilled against by a fringe, since the pretty fluff of her silky brown hair was brushed and clustered back from her temples and round her small ears, instead of combed down defiantly, or standing out aggressively in tangles over the seat of intellect. Georgie's mouth wras apt to be open like a child's \u2014 not that she gaped and looked silly ; it was simply the innocent parting of two pouting red lips between which pearly teeth gleamed ; so far from looking silly she had an almost exaggerated expression of sound common- sense and homely wisdom. It lent her an old-world, old woman air which sat wonder- fully well, with a kind of quaint grace, on her youth and bloom. Somehow the ex- pression seemed to have to do with the defect of Georgie's exceedingly comely, comfortable-looking face. This was a slight heaviness and tendency to square ness of the jaw, which one forgot in the"], [24, "12 SAPPHIRA. dimple in the chin that corresponded with another and deeper dimple going and coming; in the left cheek. Tell it not in Gath, there was something in Georgie Baldwin's face which to a student of faces might have recalled the earlier Ger man Georges as they wrere when they were ruddy, not unhandsome lads, when the second George made his horse swim the rushing river on the chance of greet ing his unhappy mother in her fortress prison, and when he was the hero of Fontenoy; when the third George turned resolutely from beautiful Lady Sarah Lennox and wras a faithful prince and loyal gentleman to his plam httle princess. By association one was reminded of the unpretending sagacity and the lack of implacability which, in the absence of more romantic and shining qualities, were marked attributes of the Electress Sophia and her immediate descendants, standino them in good stead and causing them in"], [25, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 13 the end to defeat and supplant the gal lant, vindictive, unpractical Stuarts. Georgie Baldwin was simply but very nicely dressed in a style not altogether in accordance with her surroundings. For it is not girls living in shabby ten-roomed houses which require but a single unsophis ticated maid-servant to keep them in order and to send up an early breakfast, an early dinner and a high tea, instead of the ortho dox meals, who, as a rule, wear delicately coloured washing frocks. These perfectly simple frocks, to the uninitiated, mean a good dressmaker to contrive their exquisite simplicity, and a considerable contribution to the laundress's bill to preserve the freshness of her young employer's toilet. Girls who live hi ten, not to say in two, roomed houses have to renounce many pleasant things \u2014 cool fresh summer frocks among the rest, or else if they aspire to coolness they must find it in sober -coloured beiges and bareges."], [26, "14 SAPPHIRA. Georgie's slippers, if not manufactured by a Pinnet among slipper-makers, were of the softest, finest kid, of the latest shape, with the most ravishing combina tion of buckles and rosettes all but effacing her shapely feet. Her pocket handkerchief wras of fine cambric with her monogram worked in unsurpassable embroidery. Either Miss Georgie Baldwin must be an imprudent, inconsiderate little person, and she did not look in the least like it, or she must dress at the insti- gation and under the control of somebody who thought few things within reasonable hmits too good for her. \" Mother,\" said Georgie, suddenly breaking the silence, as she began anew to arrange the marsh marigolds at her elbow, \"the cowslips and the meadowr orchises must be in bloom all around Brackengill now.\" Mrs. Baldwin started at being thus roused from a reverie. \" What do you"], [27, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 15 remember about Brackengill, Georgie ? \" she demanded in a tone which held a suspended reproof ; \" you, a mere child when wre left and went to Sheffield.\" She glanced reproachfully at Georgie as much as to say, \" Why do you pretend to an interest you cannot feel for a place which can have made no endearing impression on your childish memory ? \" All the time her patient fingers never intermitted the movement of knitting. It was not a transitory stocking she was engaged upon, it wras one of the endless squares which when combined wrere to form some huge everlasting piece of knitted work. \" Oh ! I don't remember of course,\" said Georgie carelessly ; \" but I have heard Pat and Agnes and the Scropes speak of it, and as long as Tweedside Jeannie was alive to come and see us, she used to describe the meadows with the hunts for ' daffies ' and the gathering of the"], [28, "16 SAPPHIRA. cowslips to make wine ; she had still more to say about the fells and the berries among the heather. It sounds so tempting when the warm weather is set ting in. Shouldn't you like to go back and see Brackengill again, mother ? Then I could learn to know what father's place \u2014 where we were all born \u2014 is hke.\" \" No,\" said Mrs. Baldwin, so abruptly and harshly that it caused her daughter to look up in amazement. Mrs. Baldwin, though a cold stiff woman, even to her children since they were grown up, was not wont to be irritable or petulant. Her tone cooled down in an instant, while she grasped her knitting and turned her square to wrork the other side. \" I dare- say it is natural for you to have some curiosity about your native place and your friends the Scropes' neighbourhood,\" she proceeded to say quickly ; \" at the same time you are old enough to under stand that Brackengill, which ought to"], [29, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 17 have been your brother's \u2014 which had to be sold long before he could have any voice in the sale \u2014 may have painful as sociations for some of us.\" \" I am sorry if I have hurt you, mother,\" said the girl frankly and yet with a certain reserve. For it was nearly eighteen years since her father's death, and almost as long since Bracken gill, a north county property of no great extent or value, was sold out of the family, beyond any hope of Pat Baldwin's succeeding to it. What could Pat have done with it if he had got it, since he had been educated as a doctor and could not withdraw into the wilder- ness with the expectation of finding patients there ? If the thing lamented over had been the great manufacturing firm which had come to grief in which Georgie's father had been a partner, when the partners ranked with the smaller country gentry, there would have vol. I. 2"], [30, "18 SAPPHIRA. been a little more sense hi the lamenta tion. To that rampant common-sense and fair judgment of Georgie's it appeared more far-fetched and fantastical on her mother's part to resent any allusion to Brackengill and decline to pay it a fly ing visit than it had been for her, Georgie, to cherish a girl's sentimental regard for the spot of her nativity and a pressing wish to make its acquaintance. At that instant a tap at the door heralded the entrance on the scene of the Baldwins' solitary maid-servant, a sharp supercilious young Londoner. She was not ordinarily astonished or put out at anything, but at this moment she looked both perplexed and aggrieved. \" It is the old man again, ma'am, the old serving-man as he calls hisself. I tried to get him to call to mind that he w^as here last week, and the week before that, and that no lady, let alone no servant, wrould put up with such con-"], [31, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 19 stant coining and sitting in her kitchen, but it wrere no use, he would come in and see you.\" \" I'll see him,\" said Mrs. Baldwin with a long-drawrn breath, rising slowly ; \" I've always seen Tweedside Johnnie. Since he lost his poor wife he has been more pressing and tiresome in his visits, but it is not for me to drive him awray. He was an old servant of mine and my husband's, and the creature is in his dot age, utterly in his dotage.\" She spoke half apologetically, partly to Georgie, partly to Selina, who still lingered on the threshold, with a manifest expression of injury in her attitude. As for Mrs. Baldwin she looked stiffer and wranner and more drearily mechani cal and monotonous in her actions than ever. She still grasped her bit us knit ting as if she could not let it go. Was it like a spell which at once bound her and reassured her ? Had she come to \u00b0 __*>"], [32, "20 SAPPHIRA. view it in the light of Penelope's web ? Had she knitted into it nightmare visions and desperate resolutions, fainting hopes and haunting fears, as the Tricoteuses G ' knitted their victims' crimes and the re tribution which was awaiting them at the supreme crisis of the Great Revolution. \" Don't go, mother,\" cried Georgie energetically ; \" you are alwrays the worse of seeing this foolish old man. Why should you be knocked up by yielding to his importunity ? I should say it was as bad for you as going back to Bracken gill without any of the indemnifications. It is intolerable to have him pester you in this way. Let me speak to him, if he will see one of the family. We must get Sam Scrope to interfere, threaten him with the law and rid you of the nuisance.\" \"Not on any account, Georgie,\" her mother turned round to forbid her angrily. \"What are you thinking of? I can manage my own affairs without"], [33, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 21 the aid of my daughter, not to say of any Scrope among them. See that every thing is right for Agnes when she comes in fagged from her long day at the Museum and the offices where she meant to call. That will be more hke making yourself of use than meddling in trifles and proposing to put down a wreak old man.\" Mrs. Baldwin was fairly roused from her chronic apathy, and Georgie, with her natural shrewdness, was rather re lieved to see it, though the rousing had brought down a storm on her devoted head. \" Poor mother, life is dull and stagnant for her, and she gets more self absorbed and unlike other people every day. She makes no new friends and sees no old ones. She neither goes to church nor market, as they say in the north, neither to say her prayers nor to go about the business of her housekeeping. How can she be well, though she makes"], [34, "SAPPHIRA. 22 no complaint of bodily illness ? How can she fail to grow like a ghost or a mummy ? Why she should put herself about to coax and soothe that idiot of an old Scotchman just because he happened to be in our service a score of years ago, I cannot make out. I suppose Selina thinks it very queer, and will give warn ing presently because we are not like other people. Well, Selina is not a trea sure, but she is respectable, and can look after herself, while there was Marianne who went to the corner to talk to the potman and came in on Sunday evenings smelling of gin ; and there was Bessie who could not venture alone, after six o'clock, to the post office, and cried because the butcher's boy chaffed her. Then as to having things right for Agnes, I get little credit or thanks from the object of my attentions. Agnes will be equally well pleased to eat her chop over done or under-done ; she will not notice"], [35, "AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. 23 whether her egg is new-laid or stale, she will swallow it with a cheerful, philo sophic smile, the one way or the other. And with regard to the tea's being over drawn, she will be so busy telling her adventures and claiming our sympathy, that she will drain the teapot without the slightest respect for her nerves.\" Georgie shook her head in strong dis approbation. \" Good food is wasted on Agnes,\" she wTound up her reflections, \" so is an attentive, affectionate sister, a young woman who hates to be a humbug, who while she knows she will never set the Thames on fire either by painting or any thing else \u2014 such as having clever, sen sible men dying for love of her \u2014 has yet no mind to be treated as a doll or as a baby. I can tell you it is no pleasure for her to be put on a pedestal and waited on all her days.\" Georgie threw herself back in her chair with a gesture of mingled amusement and indignation."], [36, "CHAPTER II. THE SKELETON IN THE CUPBOARD. When Mrs. Baldwin left the drawing room she knew where to go. There was no waiting-room for servants or trades men, no fair-sized hall hi such a house. The little square landing-place, which was dignified by the name of hall, was the most public spot of all, liable to per petual interruptions and uninvited audiences. These were made up of everybody who came to the street door, as well as of the different members of the household pass ing to and fro. Every messenger who desired speech with the mistress of the family or her subordmates, every patient wilieh a dispensary in the neighbourhood sent to Dr. Patrick Baldwin, since his return from Paris, wiiere he had com-"], [37, "THE SKELETON IN THE CUPBOARD. 25 pleted his medical studies, was ushered into the small dining-room, to which Mrs. Baldwin betook herself. When she was at the door she drew back for a moment, shifted the knitting which, with its ball, she held in her right hand, to her left, in order to pull out her handkerchief and pass it over her heated face, yet her sluggish blood was in general little affected by her movements. The opening of the door disclosed an old man so short and broad as to be almost dwarfish, with bandy legs and a face shrunken and skin-dried. He wore an old-fashioned decent suit, not a groom's livery, but just such a browny-black coat and trousers as a respectable working-man of any kind might have donned on occa sions of ceremony. The clothes had not only a highly respectable aspect, they lent to the wrearer a slightly solemn and funereal air which might have become a grave-digger or that ancient official of a"], [38, "26 SAPPHIRA. Scotch kirk wiio united in his grimly respectable person the functions of \" bethrel \" and \" minister's man.\" The irrepressible old man looked sub dued enough as he stood by the dining room door, holding his tall hat in one bony hand and furtively smoothing the scanty nap with the trembling fingers of the other. His uncovered head was bald, except for a fringe of russet hair behind the large ears, the deficiency of hair accentuating the high narrow fore head to an impressive extent. Otherwise there was nothing out of the common in a small-featured face covered with minute creases, unless in the degree to wiiich the nearly toothless mouth had fallen in, and in the shifting, wandering expression of the rheumy pale blue eyes. These last details combined to add a scared attribute to what was, clearly enough, the growing fatuity of second childhood. Mrs. Baldwin advanced calmly and"], [39, "THE SKELETON IN THE CUPBOARD. 27 kindly to her visitor : \"So you have come again to see me, Johnnie,\" she said quietly ; \" that is good of you ; but is not the road too far for you now that the weather is getting hot, especially since poor Jeannie is gone, and you have nobody at home to look after you when you re turn tired out ? \" \" I couldna help myself, mem,\" said the old man with a quaver in the piping voice, which, however, could not break down the childish \" dortiness\" (huffiness) and dourness in the tones ; \" I but to come. Them that sent me would not tarry or be denied.\" \" Then, of course, there was no way out of it,\" she said, as if humouring him. \" But you must tell me, Johnnie, wrhy you would not stay in the nice peaceful retreat for lonely old men like you, to which Mr. Scrope got you admission.

But sin' you've asked me, I'll tell you, mem, what I could not repeat to Maister Sam Scrope, not for a wee, till the secret's out : I could not bide with innocent undreading folk ; you ken, mem, it could not be. It wrould be the story of Joney in the ship over again.

What she said aloud was simply a mild persuasive protest. \" There wras no need for you to stay, if you did not wish it, of course ; no body would have had you remain against your will. Only, you see all things are so changed with me that I cannot pension a faithful old servant, or keep him here, under my roof, in his old age. I regarded Mr. Scrope's proposal as worth thinking of. But what am I thinking of ? I can at least take care that you rest and have something to refresh you, after you have come so far to see your old mistress. Take that chair, Johnnie, and I'll ring for Selina the maid-servant to bring in a tray, with some cold meat and bread and beer.

Agnes Baldwin, sitting there announcing herself so bountifully supplied with creature comforts, was a slender slip of a tall fair girl, not looking her five-and-twenty years. She was an entirely different type of woman from that which her sister Georgie illustrated. One would have said Agnes was not a creature of the same race. When it comes to that we English, Lowland Scotch and Americans, who claim not only Anglo-Saxons, but Normans and Danes, with possibly a sprinkling of Celts or Cymri, among our remoter ancestors, may well display traits of various nationalities ; and these sometimes appear singly and in a marked manner, with little adulteration"], [73, "THE \"TRIAL\" AND SOME OF HER DOINGS. Cl from the other sources of our complex descent. Agnes Baldwin was not so pretty as her sister Georgie, indeed, pretty was not the word for her. She had a fine free and indomitable look, such as a good hunter or hound might bear. Her head was very handsome, though perhaps a trifle too large for the slender neck. Her forehead was broad and full. Her com- plexion was too pale for her white skin, and for hair that was pale red rather than golden. Her eyes, between blue and gray in colour, were wonderfully searching and earnest, a little trying to individuals who did not care to be looked through and through, as Agnes looked them \u2014 \u25a0 unconsciously for the most part. Her nose was well formed, but small for the face. Her mouth was delicate, though it was somewhat wide and opened sufficiently, when she spoke or smiled, to show the half arch of her regular white teeth to a"], [74, "62 SAPPHIRA. greater extent than a mouth generally does. It was at once a curiously firm and a curiously sweet mouth, entirely re deeming in the first aspect what there might have been of weakness in the slightly-peaked chin. Georgie's fingers, plump, soft and white, carried a good many old-fashioned valu able rings. The long, blunt-pointed instead of tapering fingers of Agnes's rather large but well-formed hands, uniting the spatu late and psychic attributes in the same member, were guiltless of any adornment save a signet ring, which looked as if it had been a man's ring, taken in to fit a woman's hand. It was a worn gold ring, having the initials \" R.B.,\" Agnes's father's initials, inscribed on it, together with a date of thirty years back. \" Now I am going to tell you my adven tures,\" said Agnes with much gusto, after the meal was practically ended, and she was only sipping what remained of her"], [75, "THE \"TRIAL\" AND SOME OF HER DOINGS. 63 breakfast cup of tea and nibbling a bit of cake. \" I don't know that they are very different from what they were yesterday, and what they will be to-morrow, but I am sure you will like to hear them.\" She then struck into an animated narrative, certain of an appreciative audience. She had accomplished a successful hunt in the British Museum for an authority whose existence the assistant who fell to her share had at first absolutely denied. She had paid an early visit to a dilatory publisher \u2014 dilatori ness was the vice of the trade \u2014 and found a priceless MS., which she had feared was irretrievably lost, had only been waiting to be \" returned with thanks.\" \" Did you drop a tear over the poor thing's prostrate body ? \" asked Pat. \"In the stories of you story-writers all women and some men break down and weep pas sionately over your rejected addresses.

Did Roger Guiscard spend his time bewailing the bitterness and disappointment which could come to man instead of conquering Sicily ? Of course,\" said Agnes, \" I thought the man was quite right if he had no market for my wares. They might be too good, or they might be too bad for him, they were not his bargain all the same.

If I have any small talent given to me to use, or message to deliver, ought I not to be glad and thankful to be able to do it, though it should be for twenty five instead of for five hundred pounds ?

They were both engaged in marriage, each to the man of their choice, and in each case the engagement was broken off, through adverse family circumstances, without any fault on the part of the lovers : poor \" Blackberry and Gooseberry,\" as the wags unceremoniously termed them ! Agnes Baldwin could hear the tap of their high-heeled shoes when the Berrys were girls to whom the Faubourg St. Germain was free, before the great French Revolution, and the tap of their fans at a later date, when they entertained the best of company and talked of Queen Caroline's death at Brandenburg House yonder.

The Scrope family consisted, like that of the Baldwins, of a widowed mother, an only son and his sisters \u2014 three in the Scropes' case. In a general way the two families corresponded fairly in age and standing, and Scrope Hall was a country house in the north country, in the neigh- bourhood of Brackengill, another country house, which had belonged to the Bald- wins, where they had dwelt before the family reverses. Any resemblance between the Scropes and the Baldwins stopped at this point. The Scropes had retained all their earlier claims to be tolerably well-to-do country gentry, who, though not passing rich, were in easy independent circum- stances contrasted with their old acquaint- ances.

But he did not so choose. He had brains, which every body connected with him, himself included, thought it would be a sin and a shame to bury in a growing solitude and a losing occupation. He had been from youth upwards an omnivorous reader, a hard worker at his studies, and a constant thinker, though by comparison a rare speaker. He had studied for the bar, and was now a full-fledged barrister, six years older than Pat Baldwin hi years and sixteen in knowledge of the world. Sam Scrope had briefs from north country lawyers intrusted to him at recurring intervals, and he had always given satisfaction in the discharge of his duties, which is the first step towards attaining distinction in the most arduous and uphill of professional careers. It had occurred to the mother and"], [124, "112 SAPPHIRA. sisters in the north to descend on the barrister brother in London and avail themselves of his society and circle of friends. They were also able to avail themselves of a furnished house at Chis- wick, which happened to belong to Mrs. Scrope. It had come to her through an aunt, married to a merchant in London, who, with his wife, had died childless. The house had hitherto been let, but it chanced to be vacant at this time, and its owner determined to profit by the con- tingency. Mrs. Scrope was more or less of an invalid, who cherished a faint hope that London physicians might do some- thing for her weak state of health.

The Scrope girls, under the first check of disappointment and uncertainty, looked upon an accidental circumstance as quite a fortunate incident. Through a common acquaintance, they stumbled upon the Baldwins, Lancashire folk like themselves \u2014 the Baldwins who were formerly of Brackengill, whom Mrs. Scrope and even Sam could remember as old acquaintances. True, the Baldwins were not exactly in circumstances to promote the Scropes' views on London fashion able society, but Georgie, at least, was always a boon as au fait to the neigh bourhood, and ready to dispense her information about Kew Gardens and Richmond Park, Kensington Museum and the concerts at the Albert Hall \u2014 all that was likely to occupy visitors.

The Misses Scrope in their simplicity were never certain that the day might not come when to have known her, even in the most fugitive manner, might be as good as a certificate of a liberal education. Pat Baldwin was a personable escort. The Baldwins were worth being cultivated in lieu of bigger fishes. Be sides, the Scrope girls were really honestly good-natured and friendly. Having unearthed old Lancashire neigh hours, w7ho had been under a cloud of adversity, and made their acquaintance in London, the Scropes wrere disposed to stick to them and let the connection ripen into fast friendship. Mrs. Scrope did oppose the association to a certain extent, said she had never known Mrs. Baldwin well, and that the lady had dropped her as she had dropped"], [127, "\" YOUTH AT THE PROW.\" 115 every other acquaintance after her hus- band's death. It was hardly worth any- body's pains to renew the slight tie for the short time that the Scropes were to be in town. But the opposer was a timid gentlewoman, hi her weak health largely overborne, for her good as they were firmly persuaded, by her much more robust and energetic offspring. In ad- dition she was heartily sorry for the young Baldwins, of whom she did not know a particle of harm, who seemed to be making a brave fight in a not too easy or complacent world. In the end, she contented herself with not encourag- ing the intimacy by any direct act of hers. On the contrary, she employed at once the plea of her delicate health as an excuse for not calling on Mrs. Baldwdn, since Mrs. Baldwrin could not call on her. This was for the very good reason that the London lady had not left her house at Barnes since she came to it. 8\u20142"], [128, "116 SAPPHIRA.

The family dinner on Chiswick Mall went off with the liveliness of an en- tertainment at which entertainers and guests were nearly all young people \u2014 the single exception acting as a mild restraint but by no means as a heavy damper on the hilarity of the others. There was a great deal of light chat and merry badmage, to which Agnes contributed her full share, though Pat and Georgie might be thought by some to outshine her. Sam Scrope supplied the dry humour Avithout saying very much. He had not very much to say except on special occasions, when what he did say had a great deal in it, so that there was reason to think he made up for his"], [129, "\"YOUTH AT THE PROW.\" 117 paucity of speech by abundance of thought. He was as big as Pat was little \u2014 Sam's comeliness was in a somewhat heavy and colossal style, which was better set off by his wig and gown than by ordinary dress. At Scrope Hall there was a picture of an old Scrope in judge's robes which Sam was supposed to resemble. The likeness gave rise in his friends' minds to a strong and agreeable impression that he would one day be invested with her Majesty's ermine and take his seat on the bench. Susie, Stella and Sophy Scrope consti tuted the three \" S's,\" as they had a habit of defining themselves \u2014 a definition which their brother, brother-like, was careful to remind them could, by a shght divergence in pronunciation, be converted into any thing rather than a complimentary desig nation. They retorted that he formed the fourth \" S.S.\" and would suffer in their company from any eccentricity of pronunci ation. The Misses Scrope, big, though on a"], [130, "118 SAPPHIRA. smaller scale than their brother, rosy, fairly handsome, slightly boisterous, would have been well content to romp rather than flirt wdth \" little Dr. Baldwin,\" even though a more available partner had been within reach. Pat, for his part, was quite ready to exchange saucy speeches with three jolly girls, admitting that they were not downright beauties and verged on being giantesses. If the little party looked and sounded bright and animated in the dining-room, they were still more so in the drawing room, where new elements of glad and sympathetic intercourse presented them selves. Agnes, by one consent, was voted to the piano and kept there, nothing loth, for the greater part of the evening. Her singing had a charm for everybody, and yet did not interfere with Pat's games of reversi with Stella or besique with Sophy Scrope.

She had been imperfectly taught, her knowledge was halting, and she had no time to practise and improve herself in the art she loved. But she had a fine ear and a sweet voice of moderate compass. She frequently sang her own words and airs, singing them from the heart, and they were full of freshness and originality. An expert might have detected in them sins against the learned laws of harmony, vagrant notes and unequal quantities. But even to some who had not souls much beyond scales and keys, and to all who were happily not too deeply initiated into the technicalities and subtleties of music, there was an indefinite, unapproachable charm"], [132, "120 SAPPHIRA. in Agnes Baldwin's clear, tender, half-un tutored singing.

The women were fair saints and queens, without asceticism, arrogance or insolence in their saintship and queenliness ; on the \u25a0contrary, gentle and joyous, meek and -condescending, loyal daughters, noble wives, fond yet wise mothers.

Nevertheless he listened to her en- tranced, and could have listened for ever. Whatever wit, wisdom and experience he possessed, and undoubtedly his attain ments in these respects were considerable for his years, and far surpassed those of his companions, he would have willingly exchanged all the fashionable cynicism of the day, all its profane rhapsodies about life's not being worth living and mar riage being a failure, all its lawless rav ings over the forbidden delights of what is so sad, and mad and bad, and yet so sweet, for one breath of Agnes Baldwin's"], [134, "122 SAPPHIRA. high faith in Heaven and earth, her un swerving trust, her undaunted courage, her wholly bright yet half pathetic ac quiescence in all that is as best, because it came from God. So good men and women were bound to accept it and make the best of it, and to find their blessedness in taking up and bearing the yoke and the cross, like the rest of creation, and moulding themselves to the awful, merciful Father's will. It was impossible to see and hear Agnes singing and not understand that she had great delight hi her own music ; that she was in fact, as often as not, carried away with it, so as to forget time and place and all exterior circum stances.

An instinctive perception, wrhich she refused to perceive, which she put away from her in stantly and peremptorily, flashed upon her.

Mrs. Scrope always break fasted in her dainty dressing-gown and morning cap, in tranquil retirement. She was a pretty, faded, comphant little woman whom everybody petted, whose opposition nobody minded very much ; it was so certain to break dowrn in the long run.

Then, I am sure, you are too kind-hearted to need to be reminded that though the young Bald wins are making a gallant fight, they have had trouble, and have, as most people would think, fallen down hi the world.

But I cannot call on Mrs. Baldwin ; pray do not ask me, Sam,\" and the lady drew back on her sofa wdth a kind of shivering recoil. Sam Scrope looked keenly at his mother, suddenly crossed the space between them and sat down on a chair by her sofa, making it creak with his weight and the abruptness of the movement, an abrupt ness foreign to his habits.

Georgie professed indifference to his company, it is true, but of course that was only pretty coyness. Agnes had in vested her favourite heroines with the becoming quality over and over again.

Therefore as Agnes was a hundred times fonder of Georgie than of the off spring of her own brain, she wras ready to sacrifice the latter to the former with a good grace.

A GHASTLY SHOCK. Pat Baldwin was in Sam Scrope's chambers by appointment. Sam had dis missed his clerk, and the two young men were sitting alone together, in the middle of books and papers overflowing into all the four corners of the shady room. It looked out on the river, and contained reading desks, slides, lamps, and easy chairs of every degree of ease, according to modern requirements. The crucial moment was past ; Sam Scrope had braced himself to tell his astounding tale and deliver his unwelcome warning.

The wretched Tweedside Johnnie had carried out his threat of taking refuge from unsubstantial phantoms in the sohd arms of the police, and Sam had got possession of the sub stance of the deposition taken down from the accuser's mouth, to show to the recoil ing son of the inculpated woman. The statement was a different story from that which Sam had made out for himself, and the difference was of vital importance.

Still the young man was forced to see that there was some foundation for them. There had been suspicions and surmises with regard to the precise nature of Mr. Baldwin's death, of which his young children had naturally remained profoundly ignorant. Pat had regarded his mother with a manly kind-hearted young fellow's trust ing, protecting affection. He had never dreamt of doubting her. But he could not go so far as to proclaim that he would believe her, though her speech or her silence alike should make all men liars, that he would sooner deny the existence of the sun hi the sky above"], [199, "A GHASTLY SHOCK. 187 him than consent to entertain a suspicion of her being less than spotlessly innocent. He had succeeded in resisting a desperate inclination to rise up and throttle Sam Scrope on the spot, quite irrespective of any consideration that had to do with their different ages and sizes. He had even accepted, after a fashion, the damning conclusion that the mother whom he had honoured and loved throughout his entire life might have been, nay, pro bably was, a criminal in disguise all these years To prove how hard the process had been, the lad who had that morning run up the stairs to Sam Scrope's chambers, hght-hearted and free from care beyond his years, sat there a man in sore trouble, gloomy and despondent. It looked as if the lingering radiance of boyhood was ex tinguished never to return. \" Little Bald win's \" jaunty self-confidence, his mercurial thoughtlessness, had effectually deserted"], [200, "188 SAPPHIRA. him. He was sobered down and terribly in earnest at the present moment. \" Then what would you advise, Scrope ? \" he asked with the anxious helplessness of a man wiio is utterly knocked down and thoroughly dispirited. \" She must be screened at all hazards, and an exposure avoided, if possible, for the girls' sakes,\" his lip quivered as he spoke. Sam was looking at the lad with the utmost commiseration. He had liked Pat from the first, and he was favourably im pressed by the manly wray in wrhich he had borne the tremendous blow Sam had been compelled to inflict on him. Pat was rendering the painful obligation less intolerable than it might have been ; and he wras not thinking first of himself and of the probable ruin to his own prospects, but of his unhappy mother and his sisters. Above all, Sam's heart yearned over Pat because of the big quiet valiant fellow's de vouring passion, after a short intercourse, for"], [201, "A GHASTLY SHOCK. 189 Agnes Baldwin, whom he had been doomed, in her own defence, to wound desperately ; wrho had told him, for his pains, that she wrould never speak to him again, and he was inclined to believe, in spite of Pat's forbearance, that she would keep her word. \" I can only advise you to get your mother and sisters out of the way as quickly as possible,\" said Sam with an involuntary, instantly stifled sigh. \" I still trust an exposure may be prevented. Old Buhner will do nothing.\" The speaker refrained from explaining how much his private influence, brought to bear with all his power on the sole survivor of the firm in which Mr. Baldwin was a partner, had to do with Mr. Bul mer's passive attitude in the strait. \" At the same time,\" Sam felt bound to own, \"Bulmer always felt himself ag grieved by your father's death just when it occurred, and I could see he is strongly inclined to believe this idiotic Tweedside"], [202, "190 SAPPHIRA.

There was also the acci- dental absence of the doctor who had attended Mr. Baldwin throughout his ill ness, and that doctor's surprise when he heard, on his return, of the sudden ter mination of the illness in the manner alleged, together with what was said to be his annoyance at the nature of the certificate granted by old Dr. Blacket.

He forgot that all young men were not so much the heads of their houses, and the masters of the situation, as he had been from early manhood. They were not the first born of their respective families, the reigning squires, the future judges. \" Your sister Georgie,\" he proceeded, honestly seeking to help Pat by bolster ing up his waning courage, \" will probably accept your dictum, and be too full of her duties in making ready to start on a journey, on a short notice, to insist on her right to be informed what it is all about.

What a life she must have led ; what a fate is before her, even if I succeed in carrying her off from justice.\""], [212, "CHAPTER IX. FLIGHT. It was the afternoon after Agnes's memorable walk with Sam Scrope through the park. Already Georgie had been con- siderably perplexed by her sister's de- meanour. Georgie had more leisure than any of the rest of the family to make her observations. In her very matter-of-fact- ness she was apt like a child to arrive at startlingly shrewd and sound conclu- sions. Agnes had come in from her hterary errands quite unlike herself ; she was evidently greatly disturbed, but when she was questioned she would not admit any deplorable break-down in her enter prises or disappointment in her expectations. Indeed, when she saw that she had awakened Georgie's curiosity and aroused"], [213, "FLIGHT. 201 her suspicions, the culprit waxed feverishly, flightily gay, so as to cause Mrs. Baldwin to raise her grey face and heavy eyes more than once from her knitting, in silent surprise and deprecation. For her mother hardly ever found fault with Agnes, and had unbounded confidence in the daughter who had been the family's chief stay, even before they had been entirely dependent on her cheerful indefatigable exertions. Georgie was not deceived in the very least ; she had quite counted on what happened \u2014 Agnes's complete breakdown after their mother had retired for the night, and Pat had been called out to a late patient. Nevertheless, it implied no little common-sense kind of penetration and sympathy to foresee the result.

For Georgie wrould take no denial thus far, though Agnes still"], [214, "202 SAPPHIRA. steadfastly declined to say what ailed her, or for that matter to allow that anything ailed her. \" I suppose it is just because you are over-tired,\" speculated Georgie, who in sisted on looking after her sister and wrould fain have administered to her patient a cup or two of improvised beef-tea, or a little weak brandy -and- water. \" You ought not to attempt so much, dear ; you know I always say you will wralk and write yourself into a regular illness. Why will you not suffer the rest of us to do any thing to speak of for ourselves, not to say to help you ? \" said Georgie plaintively. She spoke with the mingled sagacity, pertinacity and comfortable freedom from restless inquisitiveness of a girl largely devoid of imagination. \" Above all, you ought to eat and drink your tea gently when you come in ; you should think of nothing else except of makhig an ample meal, when you have not had a bit to"], [215, "FLIGHT, 203 eat, beyond a miserable makeshift in a restaurant, since breakfast-time.

I shall be better to-morrow.\" The fact was that Agnes, in the middle of her unswerving faith in her mother and in humanity, which Sam Scrope thought so superb and so sweet, was tortured by the doubts which had been suggested. Faint old memories which she had hitherto nearly forgotten, or under stood in a totally different hght, stirred and stumbled mto fresh life. She was haunted by cruel horrible suspicions and fears to which she would not give way for a second, which she hated herself for entertaining, which it half killed her to entertain, yet which she could not dismiss and bury in oblivion. She remained at home all the next morning, making a pretence to herself"], [218, "206 SAPPHIRA. and to Georgie of being busy at her writing-desk. In reality she was not even steadily copying what she had written previously. The moment she was alone, she either let her hand fall idly on the paper, or mechanically traced meaningless lines with the pen, which she had been wont to wield so unflaggingly, a forlorn listless figure, in the room of her old happy ardent self. When Pat came home from his interview with Sam Scrope, he immediately sought out his sisters. He found them both in the httle garden at the back of the house, where Georgie had enticed Agnes to try if the fresh air would relieve the violent headache to which she had at last con- fessed. The instant the sisters saw their brother they realized enough of the change in him, the entire droop of the young fellow's physique, together with the force he had put on himself to pull nerve and"], [219, "FLIGHT. 207 muscle together, to be aware that some thing had happened to trouble him greatly. Why, in drawing on his glove he had all but tugged the thumb out, and there he was wearing the dismembered glove, as if unconscious of the conspicuous rent. A heavy shower had fallen an hour before, leaving puddles at the crossings and at the exit from the Barnes railway station. He had walked blindly through them, without making the smallest effort at picking his steps, so that he, who was naturally as neat and trim as Georgie, was in mud-bespattered boots and draggled trousers. It was a state of matters in complete discordance with the summer sun shine which was again flooding the world and making diamonds of every drop of moisture lingering on the leaves and petals of the privet and syringa bushes in the little garden. Georgie ran to her brother, Agnes stood still to allay the wild beating of her heart and to ask her-"], [220, "SAPPHIRA. 208 self, could Sam Scrope have dared to speak to Pat, as Sam had spoken to her, and wras Pat craven enough, base enough, to listen to the tale and give credence to it without striking the accuser down, in the right and might of Pat's sonship ? The moment Georgie was near enough to her brother to speak without being heard by the inquisitive Selina in the kitchen or prying neighbours over the garden walls, she addressed him anxious ly : \" You have lost the appointment to the hospital, Pat ; but why need you mind so much ? Something else will turn up.\" \" Something else has turned up,\" said Pat with a grim contortion of his face, intended to pass for a smile, which was totally unhke his ordinary cheerfully lazy or cheerfully brisk expression. \" Most probably I should have lost the post, in any circumstances ; but it would not have signified a toss-up whether I had lost or gained, since as it happens we have all to"], [221, "FLIGHT. 209 pack up and bundle off to-night, for a longer or shorter stay on the Continent : France or Germany will do equally well.

It was in a corner where the Virginia creeper had been deftly made to meet the privet hedge, and drape and shade the water-barrel.

At least, if she had not petted and indulged him and his sisters, or made them her confidants in her trials, she had not in other respects repressed and thwrarted them ; on the contrary she had constantly deferred to them, left them free to follow their own inclinations, and submitted to their de"], [227, "FLIGHT. 215 cisions, especially to those of Agnes, in a manner that was more suggestive of some pathetic reversal of their natural position than of weakness of character on her part.

The grounds of comfort are that as a family we shall be together, all the arrangements will be undertaken by me \u2014 I have been supplied with the means \u2014 and the travelling will be made as easy for you as possible. The ques tion I have to put is, will you go with me to-night, on my assurance that the journey, however troublesome and fa tiguing, is necessary, and that everything will be done that can be done, for your safety and peace ? \" \" I will go where and when you tell me, Pat,\" she said hoarsely and hurriedly, without an instant's pause. There was even a tone of weary relief hi her voice,"], [229, "FLIGHT. 217 as if she would have said : \"I have long been looking for your coming like this, and all I can say is, God bless and reward you for sparing me.\" With that she put out her twro cold cramped hands, caught at his arm and clung to it, as if, so far from putting any impediment hi his way, she was ready then and there to set out, and travel round the world to hide her bowed head at his bid- ding. He put her carefully back in her chair and looked significantly at his sisters. \" I am glad that you agree to trust me, mother, without insisting on reasons and explanations,\" he said with forced cheer fulness. \" But there is no such desperate haste,\" he continued with a little bluster, young as he wras and unused to such a crisis. \" You must take a meal first \u2014 we must all eat our dinner to help us to bear the fatigue and the long fast after wards, for we shall not be able to have a"], [230, "218 SAPPHIRA. comfortable meal again till wre have crossed the Channel. Oh, I know all about it and can take good care of you and the girls, and tell you wiiat to do. You forget how often I have gone to and from Paris \u2014 though Paris will not be our destination exactly the journey will be the same so far. Let me see,\" look- ing at his watch, \"it is half- past three nowr. You girls must set about packing, with all the despatch you can muster, what you cannot do without. The rest of your things will be seen to and sent after us. We ought to catch a tidal tram, and be at Dover or Folkestone \u2014 wre shall not attempt Harwich\u2014 in time for the night crossing. No, Georgie, wre cannot wait 'only till the morning,'\" answering the look in her eyes ; \"it is simply impossible.\" Georgie stood still in the drawing-room open-mouthed and blank-eyed.
