It is a word to conjure with ; a word with which to reach the heart's core of the most obdurate of man kind ; a word which sinks, indeed, below the surface. This was the one word with which Mrs. Holmes sought to impress her dying requests upon the minds of her two daughters \u2014 Marguerite and Edith. It was the twilight of a glorious summer's day, just a week after the death of Mrs. Holmes, when these two young ladies were sitting in the drawing-room of their uncle's house \u2014 the Rectory attached to the small Methodist Church of a meagre, impoverished village, some few miles from the sea, in the west of England. They were silent as they sat at the open window, Marguerite gazing listlessly down into the valley which the Rectory overhung, and her sister busy mending or patching up an old dress of hers \u2014 an occupation which was by no means her favourite one. These two girls, although sisters, were as opposite, physically and mentally, as any two girls could be. Marguerite was tall and very dark, almost, one would say, a brunette. She was likewise deep, dark, and gloomy in heart and mind. Edith was small, and as fair as her sister was dark \u2014 a blonde \u2014 yet she was not handsome. She was ever thoughtless and gay ; apparently meeting sorrow and joy alike with a light heart. The dark girl, whose probable age might be twenty-"], [11, "THE KEV. DE. H0L3IES AND FAMILY. 3 three was ever even-tempered, collected, and calm; calm as the placid bosom of the lake ; suffering little motion even from the passing gusts of wind, which cause but a gentle ripple on its surface, while they threateningly sway the neighbouring oaks and pines; so, the spirit of Marguerite Holmes was ever passive, passionless, and tranquil, even when those around her soared high on the wings of pleasure and mirth. It was, however, quite different with her sister Edith, a girl of 19. She was ever buoyant and light-hearted; nothing seemed to trouble her. In most persons of this nature, beneath the ripple of their almost perpetual merriment, one finds a strong under-current of sensitiveness, which makes its presence known on the proper occasions. But in Edith Holmes there was no such relief; she was jolly, and even immoderately boisterous, in the most inoppor tune moments \u2014 even when others were sad, and ready to sink beneath the troubles that she supported \u2014 troubles which seemed not to affect her. The sisters had received a very good education ut the hands of their uncle, the effect of which was widely different in each. Marguerite, possessed of an inquiring, restless spirit, was ever studying psycho logical and religiously controversial works, whilst Edith never read anything deeper than a domestic novel."], [12, "4 LADY ROSALIND. Mr. Holmes died when Edith was but two years old and Marguerite six, and their mother having died a week previous to the evening on which they are introduced to the reader, they were now entirely under the guardianship of their uncle, the Rev. Dr. George Holmes. Notwithstanding the short time which had elapsed since the demise of Mrs. Holmes, Edith seemed as if nothing extraordinary had happened, for she was as gay and chatty as ever. In justice to her, however, it must be said that she seemed very much grieved, downcast, and despondent for three days after her mother's death. During that time her sadness was something to be lamented. She went about \" like Niobe, all tears.\" But now all signs of sorrow had vanished. Not so her sister ; she was always more or less sorrowful, but her mother's quick and unexpected demise had intensified her sorrow \u2014 at least, so it seemed. At all events, her grief was genuine, from whatever cause it had sprung. As she sat, habited in black, at that window, wrapt in deep thought, she looked the picture of true melancholy. But it was not her appearance alone that denoted her truly \u2014 \" not alone her inky cloak, nor customary suits of solemn black, nor the dejected haviour of the visage, nor the fruitful river of the eye.\" These were but mere appearances. But she had"], [13, "THE REV. DR. HOLMES AND FAMILY. 5 '\" that within which passes show ; these being merely the suits of woe.\" \"What are you always dreaming about, Gretta ? \" inquired Edith, breaking the momentary silence which existed. \" Come now, cheer up ! We must do some thing to pass the time until uncle returns with his new charge. Shall I sing something for you ? \" she asked, as, putting her needlework aside, she went over to her sister and threw her arms lovingly around her neck. \" This is no time for music,\" said Marguerite. \" We can't always be sad,\" returned Edith ; \" and, besides, a little music would rouse you up. I don't like to see you so gloomy. I'll sing something \u2014 melancholy if you will,\" laughed Edith. \" Even that would prevent you from thinking.\" \" Very well, very well,\" said Marguerite, \"anything that pleases you.\" \" I'm only trying to please you,\" replied Edith, as she rushed over to a corner of the room and drew forth a mandoline. Having swept the chords two or three times with her delicate fingers, she tripped lightly back to her seat at the window, and then she sang, to siren' plaintive strains, the following lines, composed, pro bably, by some poet who had made Melancholy his muse :\u2014"], [14, "6 LADY ROSALIND.

Almost immediately after the music ceased two voices were heard at some little distance earnestly conversing. The window in which Marguerite and Edith sat commanded a good view of the long sloping avenue which led up to the Rectory. Looking down the slope in the direction from which the voices proceeded, they saw their uncle walking arm-in-arm with a young man of low stature, whom they had not before seen, but of whose coming they had received due notice. They withdrew from the window ; but Edith laughed a merry laugh as, with characteristic curiosity, she got behind one of the window draperies, and from this \" coign of vantage \" scrutinized with curious, searching eye the form and features of the new-comer.

Edith, iu the spring-time of thy life \u2014 a life till now unsullied by a single cloud of sorrow \u2014 thou mayest make merry ; break forth in lively flashes of hilarity, and view things en coleur de rose ; but the time is fast approaching when thou shalt feel, with piercing acute ness, the terrible pangs of the remorse and sadness of a reproachful, troublous, embittered existence \u2014 an existence blasted even as the vine is sometimes when in its first flower ! The two figures disappeared from view as they"], [16, "8 LADY ROSALIND. turned an angle of the building, and walked towards the front entrance of the house, and Edith kept her eyes on the stranger until she could see no more. But before this unknown individual crosses the threshold of that home (for his coming wrought a wonderful change) let us see who he was, whence he came, and why he came. Wilhelm Holzapfel (for that was his name) was of German descent. He was about twenty-seven years of age ; small, and good-looking, with dark curly hair, and sallow features. Although not handsome, there was something irresistibly fascinating and prepossessing in his manner \u2014 a something inexplicable, which attracted everyone towards him, both men and women, but more especially the latter. He was but poorly clad, wearing a much-discoloured and badly-fitting light suit. Yet, were he in rags it could not be denied that he had the manners and bearing of a gentleman. Such, in brief, was the man ; and now as to the object of his visit. Dr. Holmes, in order to swell his exchequer, made the Rectory a sort of cease-to-do-evil for young men, who, having money to spend, were leading a reckless, devil-may-care existence. The doctor, who was very penurious, always took care that he was well paid for his trouble ; whilst he contended that at the Rectory,"], [17, "9 THE REV. DR. HOLMES AND FAMILY. away from the unhealthy and tempting atmosphere of London \u2014 away from the haunts of vice which per vaded the town, and under his own personal observa tion, rash, spendthrift, and hot-headed young men could not but mend ; and this, indeed, was a \" consum mation devoutly to be wished,\" although, if truth must be told, the doctor little troubled himself as to this point, so long as the parsonage coffers were kept full. One of the above described class of young men was Wilhelm Holzapfel, a careless and gay, happy-go-lucky individual, who, from the time he was thirteen years of age (when he ran away from a boarding school in Germany, and walked thirty miles home), led as reck less a life as he very well could. After returning from school, his first exploit was to elope with his sister's governess to England, and, having got rid of her, he travelled out to Africa, where he joined a volunteer corps. The tropical heat and heavy marching, however, were more than he cared for, and soon he was on his way back to London, but not before he had borrowed \u00a31,000 from a Jewish money-lender in Cape Town, and got off with it scot free. Gambling quickly relieved him of the thousand pounds, and now, through family interest, he procured a commission in the Army. Here again he came to grief ; he commenced to drink, went out on parade with his men, the back of his helmet to"], [18, "10 LADY ROSALIND. the front, his belt over the wrong shoulder, whilst he called out his commands altogether wrong, eliciting the hearty laughter of the soldiers. This sort of thing would not be tolerated, and Holzapfel was obliged to leave the regiment. During this period of military service he became engaged to two young ladies in the town of L , where his regiment was quartered, without the slightest intention of marrying either, and were it not that he left the town so suddenly, leaving his subsequent whereabouts a mystery, he would in all probability have been in for a couple of breach of promise actions. For two years and a half after this he lived a princely life in London and Dublin ; all at the expense of sundry hotel proprietors, tailors, and traders of all sorts and descriptions. This kind of proceeding, as might naturally be expected, did not last long, and eventually Holzapfel was dogged in all directions by process-servers and bailiffs. Meanwhile, Holzapfel mortgaged his property (a very valuable English estate, left him by his father) for a mere song, thus leaving his net annual income somewhere about \u00a350. \u00a350 ! A mere nothing for Wilhelm Holzapfel, he who, not so long since, could give that paltry sum away without as much as missing it!"], [19, "11 THE REV. DR. HOLMES AND FAMILY. This was the state of Holzapfel when he came under the notice of a certain London clergyman, who took him up and placed him under the care of Dr. Holmes at the Rectory, and such was the man who, for the trifling consideration of at most \u00a350 per annum, was brought to be the daily companion of Marguerite and Edith Holmes. Such was the man who was about to cross the threshold of that secluded and quiet home. a man whose like had never entered the Rectory before. for it may be mentioned that his predecessors were all but perfection when compared to him. Holzapfel, on his arrival, was too weary to appear at supper that night, and retired to rest almost imme diately. Consequently, Edith's curiosity to see him remained unsatisfied until the following morning. Why she was thus eager to see and know this stranger was a question that she herself might not be able to answer, but could she only see into the near future she might rue the day that brought Holzapfel to the Rectory. The next morning they had breakfast at nine o'clock. according to custom. The Doctor, a medium-sized, sharp-featured, grey haired man of about 60, had a constitutional walk beforehand, and when he returned he found his nieces and Holzapfel in lively conversation, sitting around the breakfast-table, awaiting his return."], [20, "12 LADY ROSALIND. Having exchanged salutations, the Doctor seated himself at the head of the table, and during the entire meal he and Holzapfel seemed to vie with each other in point of loquacity. \" Again I bid you welcome to the Rectory, Mr. Holzapfel,\" said Dr. Holmes, as they finished a hearty meal. \" And my nieces will have much pleasure in showing you around the neighbourhood, and pointing out everything of note.\" Edith nodded assent, and the Doctor continued : \" We have plenty of tackle if you care for fishing ; you can have a gun, too, if you like shooting, and as for boating, there are plenty of boats to be had at the shore.\" \" Thank you very much. Doctor,\" replied Holzapfel. \"I am sure that with such company I shall be perfectly happy during my stay with you.\""], [21, "CHAPTER II. A STRANGE DREAM. \"The limits of science are like the horizon, the more we approach them the more they recede.\" \u2014 Mme. Necker. It was about a week after Holzapfel's arrival at the Rectory, and Marguerite and Edith were sitting by themselves over the usual nine o'clock breakfast. Their uncle was seldom down latterly for half-an-hour after that time, and Holzapfel, as a general rule, made his appearance at ten or later. So the two young ladies were alone, conversing confidentially on this occasion. \" I had a strange dream last night, Edith,\" re marked Marguerite. \" Oh ! You're always dreaming,\" retorted Edith. \" I don't wish to hear any more of your dreams ; I believe that the half of them are mere flights ot' imagination \u2014 day dreams.\" \"Well, may be so \u2014 maybe so,\" returned Marguerite. \" And as you don't wish to hear any more of my dreams, perhaps I had better keep this one to myself.\" \" Oh ! let me hear it, by all means,\" asked Edith,"], [22, "14 LADY ROSALIND. unable to restrain her curiosity. \" What was it about ? \" \"It was all about you; a most curious dream,\" answered Marguerite. \" Tell it to me then ; I'd like very much to hear it when it was about me,\" said Edith, in an eager tone. \" Ah ! well, I will tell you then. I thought I was transported to the beach of a large island, where I stood so close to the water's edge that my feet were washed by the rolling waves. You were by my side ; and you seemed eager to break away from me and plunge into the sea, whilst I was trying by all the force of persuasion, and even by physical force, to stop you. \" The island on which we stood, I thought, repre sented Security, and turning round I saw behind me, at some considerable distance, several noble, benign looking female figures, on whose bright and sparkling helmets were graven different symbolic words. One bore the word Peace, another Friendship, another Prosperity, another Happiness, another Content, and other kindred terms. \" Looking out upon the broad expanse of the sombre surging sea (which I knew was the ocean of Fate), s saw thousands of human beings tossing and heaving on the merciless billows. Some were by themselves und others clung to one another ; now rising high on"], [23, "15 A STRANGE DREAM. the roaring waves and now precipitated in the ridges and farrows of the restless waters. All was dark as Erebus, save for the occasional beams of the sickly moon, which now and then lighted the scene as the murky leaden clouds floated over its face. \" Rising high out of the waters I beheld, in the fitful moonlight, numerous peaky rocks \u2014 some large, some small \u2014 on each of which there stood a being, whose outward appearance resembled, to some extent, the human female form. Each of these figures held in its right hand a twisted rope \u2014 some were gold, some silver, some silk \u2014 the ends of which dangled in the waves of the ocean of Fate. The innumerable human beings who were heaving to and fro on the relentless waves grappled with nervous energy at those apparent means of succour, only to be immediately dashed back into the dark, dreary waste. \" The female forms were also emblematic. Far out to my right I saw one of these majestic figures up holding a standard, on which was emblazoned the word Atheism, whilst standing around her were three impish dwarfs, on whose breasts were engraved the words Discord, Chaos, and Ate. At a greater distance in the same direction I discerned another sylph-like creature. She, I thought, represented Pride, and following in her train were more demoniacal elves, representative of Envy, Calumny, Malice, and Slander."], [24, "16 LADY ROSALIND. Another prominent figure \u2014 beautiful, attractive, majestic \u2014 symbolized Love. Following in her wake were Deceit, Jealousy, and Despair. In short, all the vain glory, all the false pleasures, and likewise all the miseries and sufferings which visit humanity in this work-a-day world, were shown forth, but to my mind the most pleasing of these figures was but a glaring deception \u2014 a gilded dissimulation. \" Further away than any of the other forms, and more vapoury and transient still, I discerned a radiant, shining representative of Hope. She was alone ; not a single attendant or satellite was near her. Many were the anxious looks which were cast upwards from the surging waters towards her beauteous form as she stood far, far away in almost inaccessible remoteness. \" Looking out on the wide expanse to the left of where I stood, I saw a long, leviathan, loathsome looking, pitch-black vessel, on the prow of which I saw the word Death. Smoothly it sailed in its slow, inevitable course, picking up hundreds of living beings as it passed. \" Presently I beheld, quite close to the shore, a small and fragile skiff, in which I thought Mr. Holzapfel was standing, struggling with all his might to steer it safely to the land. After moments of imminent peril he succeeded in doing so, and, having made our acquaintance, he seemed restless, and anxious to be"], [25, "17 A STRANGE DREAM. off again. He would not, however, go without you ; and, after some little persuasion, yon consented to accompany him, whilst I protested and even implored you not to do so. \" The scene now wavered before me ; but soon my vision grew clear again, when, to my dismay and horror, I saw you both in the light craft, sailing, or rather tossing and heaving about, at the mercy of the winds and waves of Fate, where one dare not say that his soul was his own. I could not bear the sight, and yet my eyes seemed rivetted upon you. At every moment the boat threatened to capsize, which it ulti mately did ; and for several minutes I lost sight of you altogether. When you came to the surface you were separated \u2014 Mr. Holzapfel was struggling against Fate in one direction, you in another ; and the boat had dis appeared. Almost at that instant the Death ship sailed close to Mr. Holzapfel. It took him up with many others, and continued its onward course ! \" Short as was the time which it took me to bring my eyes back to where I had seen you in the waters, I had scarcely done so when the strange phantasm was suddenly terminated ! \" I woke, and the weird awfulness and realism of that dream lingered, and will ever linger, in my mind.\" Edith, who up to this had listened attentively, but C"], [26, "18 LADY ROSALIND. incredulously, to her sister's words, now broke forth into a merry peal of laughter. ' I don't believe in dreams ! \" she exclaimed. \" Oh ! you may laugh ; you're always laughing,\" con tinued Marguerite, \" but my dreams, whether you be lieve in them or not, always come true. Do you remember the dream I had shortly before our poor mother's death ? \" \" I do remember your telling me of a dream you had, but I forget what it was,\" replied Edith, in an oblivious way. \" Oh ! you are forgetful ! \" said Marguerite ; \" but I will tell it to you again. About a week before our dear mother died, before she got ill at all, I dreamt that I came into this room and that I saw her lying in a swoon in the centre of the floor ; looking about, I be held a tall, black figure \u2014 Death \u2014 standing behind the door, grinning hideously. A little after I entered, it came over and jumped on the figure on the floor, until life left the body. You stood in the corner of the room, wailing and wringing your hands piteously, your hair hanging dishevelled over your shoulders. Do you remember now ? \" \" Oh, yes, I do, of course. You told me about that, answered Edith. \" Well, and didn't that dream come true \u2014 cruelly true ? \" asked Marguerite."], [27, "A STRANGE DREAM. 19 \" Oh, it did,\" said her sister ; \" but, at the same time, I don't believe that your dream was any indica tion or omen of what would happen. I don't give credence to dreams.\" \" But I do,\" said Marguerite, \" for my dreams were always forewarners of some particular events. I would therefore ask you to think of my dream, and above all to remember our poor mother's last words, more particularly what she said regarding young men whom uncle might think fit to bring to the Rectory, for she did not warn you without reason.\" \"I do ; I will remember her words,\" said Edith, pensively; \" but why should she warn me like that's' \" \" Well, you know,\" returned Marguerite, in a sooth ing voice, \" it was her anxiety for your welfare and not a wish to chide that prompted her to speak to yon as she did ; and I am sure you will admit that she had legitimate ground to warn when you consider the class of young men whom uncle brought here lately \u2014 young men, too, with whom you have been, to my mind, unduly familiar. Why don't you do as I do and keep away from them? I regard such fellows \u2014 fellows who come here to be reclaimed \u2014 no matter what their social position may be, as altogether unfit company for us.\" \" I know, dear Gretta, that you are right, and\u2014 \" At this juncture the Doctor entered the room, and, as he did, Edith exclaimed \u2014"], [28, "20 LADY ROSALIND. \" Here comes uncle ; we'll ask him what is his opinion about dreams. Good-morning, uncle ; we have just been talking about dreams. Do you believe in them ? \" said Edith, with her accustomed impetuosity. \" I do believe in dreams, that is when they are defined as I will explain,\" said Dr. Holmes, in a some what hesitating manner, as he seated himself at the breakfast table. \" How ? I would like very much to know,\" said Marguerite, quickly. \" I sometimes have most remark able dreams, and true ones too. What's your theory ? \" Marguerite did not wish the Doctor to know the subject of their conversation before he had entered \u2014 thus her precipitation. \" My opinion or theory regarding- dreams, which I will endeavour to make as clear to you as possible,\" said her uncle, deliberately, \" is this, that in every man there are faculties and powers of an altogether trans cendental order to those ordinarily brought into play and exercised through the senses. Under certain con ditions and circumstances, to wit, those of dream life and somnambulism, conclusive proof is given of the existence of a side of our being which is not included or embraced in our ordinary consciousness \u2014 of the existence in man of a higher and superior order of things than those of sense. When persons are dream ing, the barrier which, in a state of wakefulness."], [29, "21 A STRANGE DREAM. exists between these hidden faculties and powers, and the faculties of sense, is more or less removed, or rather shifted, and persons, under such influence, are capable of actions and of foresight into the events of the future, which in wakeful moments would be absolutely impossible.\" \" And how,\" inquired Marguerite, \"do you account, uncle, for the remembrance of dreams ? \" \" The reason why we remember a dream,\" replied the Doctor, \" is because these latent faculties, to which I have referred, are connected to a certain extent with the faculty of sense ; but the prison of flesh hinders the development of these higher powers, and only allows the scenes of dreamland to make a very slight and vague impression on the mind.\" Marguerite nodded apprehension, and inquired the cause of nightmare. \" Persons never get nightmare except when they sleep on their backs,\" answered the Doctor. \" The two faculties \u2014 superior and inferior \u2014 are always at war with one another, if I may so speak, for predominance ; in sleep the conflict is keener, and when a person sleeps on his back the conflict is still more intensified by reason of the warring faculties coming into closer contact with each other. There are many reasons which I could give for holding these opinions ; but, mainly owing to the facts which I have narrated, I"], [30, "22 LADY ROSALIND. believe that a dream \u2014 no matter how vague it may be \u2014 is au insight into events which yet lie undelivered in the womb of time. Future scientists may be able to throw more light upon these transcendental powers, and may find a means by which they can be developed ; but, notwithstanding this, I implicitly believe that not until after death (until death deprives us of sense conscious ness and leaves free those higher powers, of which in dreams and sleep-walking we only obtain flashes) will those latent faculties reach their full development. There is an impenetrable mystery in connection with all these things, and I don't think that it is right, my dear child, to think too deeply on them, or even to think on them at all.\" Marguerite had listened with marked attention to the Doctor's explanation, although it gave her no further information than she was already possessed of, if, indeed, it gave her as much, for she had read and thought on the subject, perhaps far more than did her uncle ; still it furnished her with food for a day's reflection. But, as for Edith, her guardian's words were unremembered and unthought of by her; they fell as flat upon her ears as they did upon the petals of the odour-weeping hyacinths, which grew in a box by the window. Aye, perhaps, far more flat, for who can say that in those slender, waxlike flowers there"], [31, "A STRANGE DREAM. 23 does not dwell a spirit, a soul more sensitive than many that inhabit our fleshy forms.

THE TRAPPER TRAPPED. La mort est-elle un mal ? La vie est-elle nu bien ? After a short time the Rectory became a lively place, far different from what it had been before Wilhelm Holzapfel went to reside there, and Edith was in her glory at having a congenial, kindred spirit who would help her to enliven the house and to dispel the gloom which of late hung over the parsonage and all its inmates save herself. Holzapfel went all round the neighbouring country, now shooting, now fishing, now boating ; one day he went up the mountain side, his gun over his shoulder; another day he hired a boat, and alone, in the veriest 6kiff, he rode fearlessly over the mountainous billows of seas as rough as were ever experienced along the coast ; another day he would stray along the riverside"], [33, "25 THE TRAPPER TRAPPED. fishing. In these expeditions, however, he was solely prompted by love of sport, for the beauties of nature had no attraction for him. The verdant cliffs, towering towards the sky, the sunny hills, covered with heather. where wild goats ambled all day long, the solemn, stately form of the oak, the sadness of the cypress and the willow, the fragility of the aspen or the reed, the beauty of the flowing, silver stream, the stillness of the lake, the silence of the deep, dark river \u2014 these, one and all, had no charms for him. Such scenes arouse in many hearts thoughts of the omnipotent God, the God whose wonderful works are everywhere proclaimed to the appreciative and observant intelligence of man, more particularly in the realms of nature. But Wilhelm Holzapfel was not inclined that way; he cared as little for these scenes as he would for their pictures on paper. Of these rustic amusements, or pastimes, how ever, Holzapfel soon got tired, and became restless and wished that he could leave the Rectory. Indeed, he would have done so, and returned to his reckless London life, but for Edith. She was greatly drawn towards him by reason of his charming, careless affability of manner, and he for amusement's sake, if for nothing else, was glad of late to have her company as he went fishing in the river, which ever ran beneath the parsonage. Soon Edith began to feel complete happiness in his"], [34, "\u25a02C> LADY' ROSALIND. company, and as a consequence she never permitted him to go anywhere alone, and this despite her departed mother's and her solicitous sister's words of advice. In the morning they walked together, and in the evening they went fishing together ; indeed, lightsome day often merged into twilight, and twilight glided into moonlight, as they sat on the lonely river bank fishing. Latterly, they fished with but little reward for their pains, and no wonder, for on several occasions, on pulling up their lines, they found, sometimes, that they were fishing without any bait, and other times that their lines dangled hookless in the waters. And while thus Wilhelm and Edith were insepar able, Marguerite was left alone, save at meal hours and when her uncle had time to converse with her. As long as Edith could be with Holzapfel she would never think of her sister. Marguerite, in truth, was too gloomy, too pensive for either of them ; and as for Holzapfel, he disliked her from the first moment he saw her \u2014 he looked upon her as the veritable personi fication of gloom, as, indeed, she was. Sad she was always ; more sad still after her mother's demise, and now, alone, still sadder. Her thoughts were ever on the world to come ; well could she say \u2014 My thoughts on awful subjects roll \u2014 Damnation and the dead. Being questioned by her uncle as to her undue"], [35, "27 THE TRAPPER TRAPPED. solemnity and apparently ever-present grief, she would answer : \" I cannot stifle the sadness and indefinable longings that arise in my breast. 1 sup pose while life lasts it will be so. Of course there are those who would laugh at me, but I think (at least with myself it is so) that it is the thought, or shadow of it, walking so close by my side, that I cannot be always here, and then where ? I do not fear death, but the mystery and the shadow naturally has its shadoiv for me. Such a state of mind as this was certainly deplorable in one so young, and the solitude of a dwelling in a small sequestered West of England village could not be calculated to alleviate such feelings. Thus she was and thus she remained, for neither her sister, her uncle, nor Holzapfel had any great sym pathy with her, and she, knowing this, kept as much to herself as possible. Almost every fine day that came she went to the sea shore (a couple of miles distant), where she walked alone along the beach, or sat on some lonely, un frequented part of the fringe of rocks that lined part of the shore, mayhap reading some deep metaphysical book or contemplating on the sea and its wonders, now and then watching the curlews as they hovered over the surging waves, or mentally instituting parallels between man drifting (aimlessly) on the ocean of life."], [36, "28 LADY ROSALIND. and the tempest-tossed and perilous boat of the fisher man, and between man steadily steering and never wavering in his voyage of life, and the smooth, regular, and stately course of a ponderous argosy. But to return to Edith and Wilhelm. They soon threw aside the fishing, and in its stead they went for long strolls together each evening. On one of these occasions, as they walked arm-in-arm along the pictur esque banks of the river R \u2014 , Holzapfel spoke seriously {as he had often done jocosely) of leaving the Rectory. \" I can't stand this life any longer, Edith. I must go up to London, if only for a time, and then I think I will go to Ireland to pay a visit to a cousin of mine there whom I have not seen these years,\" he said. Edith looked searchingly into his face with a view of seeing if he really spoke in seriousness. It was grow ing so dark that she could not distinctly see his features, but from what she could see, she came to the conclusion that this time, at least, he meant what he said. \" What ! \" she exclaimed ; \" going to leave so soon h And what about me ? Can I not go with you ? \" \" Oh ! I will be back again very soon,\" said Holzapfel, as he suddenly remembered that it was only a week ago since he had actually proposed to Edith that she should become his wife. But this was no unusual incident in the life of"], [37, "29 THE TRAPPER TRAPPED. Holzapfel ; she was not the first, the second, the third, nor the fourth girl whom he had proposed for in a similar way. In truth, he was merely playing upon her affections, whilst she was really in love with him. \" But when would you come back if you did go up to London ? \" asked Edith. \" Oh ! well,\" said Wilhelm, \" that would all depend upon circumstances. I might be a fortnight \u2014 might be two months.\" This was enough for Edith. She knew that if he once left the Rectory she might never see him again. This was a thought she could not bear, and from that moment she determined, at all hazards, to accompany Holzapfel, no matter whither he went, even to the ends of the earth. \"I will go with you \u2014 -I must go with you, Wilhelm. How could you leave me so long and so lonely here by myself ? \" she said, excitedly. \"Well; I will bring you with me if you wish,\" answered Holzapfel. \"But,\" he added, seeing the fix he had placed himself in, \" I may not go for some con siderable time yet.\" Edith, however, saw at once that he said this merely to please her, and the thought flashed through her mind that he might take his flight some night un known to all. But she was determined that this"], [38, "30 LADY ROSALIND. should not occur, and that she would watch his every action. They were both in too thoughtful a mood to converse further whilst they were walking homewards \u2014 he contemplating on the awkwardness of his position, if Edith insisted on keeping with him, and she revolving in her mind what the consequences of following him might be, but never for a moment thinking that her sister's dream, which she had laughed to scorn, was already coming true. When they arrived at the Rectory a new trouble awaited Holzapfel. Standing patiently outside the hall door was a cringing, hungry-looking, dirty, ragged man, with deeply-sunken eyes, and a sandy beard of about four days' growth. As Holzapfel and Edith approached the entrance to the Rectory, he sneaked, rather than walked, up in front of Holzapfel. \" So this is where you are, is it ? \" he said, with a diabolical chuckle of satisfaction. \" You've dodged me a long time, but I've got you at last, eh! boy!\" and he caught Holzapfel by the coat-sleeve with his long, bony fingers, his cat-like nails almost tearing the sleeve. whilst he uttered another chuckle. \" Oh, curse you, you damned scoundrel ! \" shouted Holzapfel, flying into a passion, as he recognized in his accoster a process-server \u2014 an old follower of his \u2014"], [39, "THE TRAPPER TRAPPED. 31 wdiom he had managed to evade for several months. \" Are you coming to persecute me again ? \" and he made a rush at the unfortunate bailiff ; but the latter, with the agility of a monkey, sprang back out of his way and avoided, probably, a blow from a hand whose weight he was ere now accustomed to. \"Not in the humour now, eh!\" said the process server, and again he sniggered and grinned like a Cheshire cat. \" Get out of my sight,\" shouted Holzapfel, \"or I'll blow your brains out.\" So saying, he suited the action to the word, and, drawing- from his breast a pistol, levelled it at the process-server's head. Another moment and the man would have been a lifeless pile on the ground were it not that Edith (who, up to this, stood amazed, wondering what it all meant) dashed up the muzzle of the pistol just as Holzapfel pulled the trigger, und the bullet whizzed harmless through the air. \"That's a dangerous game, sir: you tried that before with me.\" \"Yes, and I'll try it again, too,\" said Holzapfel, \" if you keep following me. Leave this place, and never let me see you again, or your life will not be safe.\" \"All right, sir \u2014 all right, sir; I'll go. So you're out of humour, are you, eh ? \" remarked the process server, to whom this little incident was nothing new."], [40, "32 LADY ROSALIND. \" But I'll see you to-morrow,\" he added, as he walked away, or rather disappeared, in the darkness. \" Who is that ? Is he a friend of yours ? \" anxiously asked Edith when the process-server was gone. \" No, confound the fellow ! he's not a, friend of mine, but an enemy,\" said Holzapfel, vexed at being asked the question. \" But icho is he ? \" persisted Edith. \" It's enough, I think, to tell you that he's an enemy, and the sooner I get away from him the better. But speak no more of him. Come in, and if the Doctor asks what the shot was, tell him that I fired at \u2014 well, at a passing rabbit.\" They went in, and, as they did so, Edith remarked, in her usual light-headed way \u2014 \" Missed a rabbit at a few yards distance ! What will the Doctor say when he hears that ? \" The Doctor did hear the shot, and Marguerite too ; and the aforementioned was just coming out to see what was the matter. He was, however, completely set at rest on hearing Holzapfel's explanation. But the latter was much chagrined during the evening by the Doctor's taunting remarks as to his missing the shot ! Next morning Holzapfel was up early watching for the process-server ; but that worthy gentleman did not"], [41, "THE TBAPPEB TRAPPED. 33 turn up. Day followed day. night night, and still he did not come ; and then things lapsed once more into the old monotonous groove \u2014 the Doctor pursuing his pastoral duties ; Marguerite reading, walking, or sitting by the sea-shore ; and the lovers (?) billing and cooing as of old, Holzapfel silent as to leaving the Rectory. Thus these side-players played their parts on the broad stage of Life \u2014 that stage on which our fellow actors are our audience. Thus do we (human spiders) all, in our own peculiar way, work a part in the weaving of that much-entangled web \u2014 the web of Fate.

In the interior of Africa, along the banks on either side of the river G \u2014 , at the time to which the story refers, there was a wild, small, obscure district of country, which had wou a certain amount of fame for its gold and diamond fields. The land upon each side of this river was, for the most part, flat and woody. Xear the sea there were no hills or mountains, but high up the river were ledges of lofty and rocky hills, chiefly composed of ironstone. Notwithstanding their adamantine qualities, they were covered with trees. and served greatly to beautify the face of the country. From time to time adventurers and fortune-seekers had come from all countries \u2014 whether by chance or H'ood guiding it is hard to say \u2014 and settled down, one by one, in this almost unknown district, until, finally, it became colonized by a greedy, rapacious, blood thirsty set of about two hundred men, whose sole object was to seek, with avidity, for gold and diamonds,"], [44, "36 LADY' ROSALIND. in which they were frequently successful, and when they were successful \u2014 (when one party came upon a profitable \"find\")\u2014 they fled away back to the lands from whence they came, fearful lest their neighbours might come to know of their good fortune and murder them, in order to become possessed of their long looked-for and hard-earned prize. They sought laboriously and indefatigably for those hidden treasures by day, and they murdered and plundered one another by night. They have often been known to come under cover of night, armed and disguised, to murder and rob any of their neighbours whom they suspected of having gold or diamonds \u2014 they lived in awe and fear of one another. They resided in rude huts, erected by themselves. As a general rule they went in pairs, and the two so living together divulged to one another all their secrets, and shared each other's gains. These huts were roughly-constructed habitations, and were, in all cases where practicable, pitched upon rising ground, for in the rainy seasons large portions of the country were generally submerged in water. The frame-work of the huts, including upright posts and ridges, etc., was built of rudely- wrought man groves. The walls, which were two feet thick, were built of well-tempered clay, while the roofs were covered in with thick mats made of straw, projecting"], [45, "37 CLAUDE CHAMTEPEUDRIX. about three feet, in order to secure the walls from damp and wet. The only ventilation was by means of an open space of one foot between the walls aud the roof. Each hut was sheltered by giant trees, and sur rounded by a piece of ground containing about an acre, enclosed with a fence seven feet high, made of split canes woven like hurdles. Part of this enclosure was set off as a garden, from which these reckless men supplied themselves with fruit and vegetables, and part for fowl and other stock. About these settlements were deer and wild hogs, partridges, geese, ducks, and quails. The country afforded shooting, and the fortune-hunters were never at a loss for plenty of good eating as long as they had the use of their guns. They also hunted lions, leopards, and tigers. At night, however, they had to take great precautions against these wild animals that went about howling and roaring as soon as the shades of night had fallen, and against snakes and serpents, which were very numerous. Gambling was the usual, though risky, pastime of the diamond-seekers whenever they stayed indoors at night, their principal game being faro. Partners used to play constantly to decide which of them would become possessor of the day's gains, and not infrequently did they put at stake everything of which they were the owners."], [46, "38 LADY ROSALIND. It was night, and in one of these huts a young man. strange and wild-looking, was seated at a rough wooden table before a huge fire which burned, or rather smouldered, upon a wide stone hearth. He was staring with an abstracted, vacant stare on the glowing logs before him. He seemed to be in a kind of dream -, he saw not, certainly did not heed, what he looked at. He was tall and handsome, apparently about six and-twenty years of age. His figure was robust and shapely; his eyes large, hazel, and extremely keen in expression ; his features long and sharp ; his nose aquiline, whilst a heavy moustache covered a small mouth and hid from view a set of pearly teeth which. when he smiled \u2014 which was seldom \u2014 would be other wise visible. His hair was black, long, and curly. falling in silken folds over his broad shoulders, after the fashion of the old cavaliers. His face presented in every feature the traces of care, disappointment, and regret ; anxiety and sorrow were impressed \u2014 one would say almost indelibly \u2014 upon his brow. There was some thing mystic, something indescribably supernatural in his aspect. There was a certain expression in his face and a keen brightness in his eyes which were pre possessing and attractive, yet unearthly and preter natural. The furniture and surroundings of this habitation were decidedly out of keeping with the appearance of"], [47, "CLAUDE CHANTEPERDRIX. 39 its occupant. The chattels were rude and scanty \u2014 a small chest for clothes ; a mat raised upon posts from the ground to lie on ; a table ; a jar to hold water, a calabash to drink it from, and a few food utensils ; two or three stools ; sundry guns, pistols, and daggers, which hung- upon the walls \u2014 these, together with a good supply of rugs and furs made from the skins of wild beasts, constituted all the furnishing and orna mentation of which the unostentations dwellers could boast. The only other light in the apartment besides that from the fire was the fitful, flickering glare shed from a kind of taper or rushlight, which stood wasting on the table. The two lights combined were just suffi cient to render darkness visible. Lying on the table were two long pipes and a jar of wine made from the juice extracted from the palm trees which abounded in the neighbourhood. There was also on the table the inevitable pack of cards, beside which lay a black cane about eight or ten inches long and half-an-inch in diameter. It was a wand ! a wand which Claude Charteperdrix's father (for that was this strange man s name) had given him when he was but a boy. Claude at the time looked upon it as a mere piece of worthless wood ; but for the simple reason that it was given to him by his father he treasured it as a precious prize."], [48, "40 LADY ROSALIND. His father had been burned alive as a wizard in his native country, France, where his supposed extra ordinary power over the spirit world and his practice of the black art made him the terror of all whom he came into contact with. On this account Claude doubly valued this caducean prize. He carried it with him everywhere. As he was examining it one day at home in the country of his birth (Ireland), and thinking of the donor, he accidentally waved it downwards in a northerly direction, when his father's spirit appeared to him. He looked so hideous \u2014 writhing and wincing, as if he were undergoing nameless excruciating tor tures \u2014 that Claude, in terror, let the wand fall from his hand upon the floor, when the apparition imme diately vanished. He was so appalled that he then and there vowed never to summon his father's spirit again. He had, however, often used the wand since whenever he wished to have recourse to anyone else who had left this world, or, to speak more accurately, who had once inhabited bodies in which Claude knew them. On the day of the night on which Claude was sitting in this reverie, he and his partner had come across a large quantity of diamonds, probably worth \u00a350,000, and Claude was now thinking of returning to his home and to his wife in Ireland."], [49, "41 CLAUDE CHANTEPEKDKIX. He had been compelled to leave both some five years previously owing to circumstances which will be nar rated hereafter. During his five years of exile in this distant land he had only made use of the wand on two occasions. He had used it about two years ago in order to call forth the spirits of his wife and her father, who were the only relations he left behind him in the old country; but failing to do so, he concluded that they both still lived. Now that he had been fortuuate in finding such a large quantity of diamonds, he was naturally anxious to know if his relations still lived ; for if his wife had since died (or, rather, if her spirit had quitted the body in which he knew her, to enliven another body), he would have no interest in journeying back to Ireland. A thought struck him ; he would again have recourse to the rod ! He rose from the rude stool on which he sat, took up the wand in his right hand and waved it, first from north to south, then from south to north, from south to west, west to south, and so on, with a view to summoning the spirit of his wife ; but all to no pur pose. Therefore he concluded she was still alive in the old form. He went through the same gesticulations to see if her father lived, and if he did not, to invoke his spirit ; aud when the wand was stretched upwards towards the heavens some occult power seemed to hold it in that"], [50, "42 LADY ROSALIND. direction ; Claude could not bring it downwards. Pre sently a strong down-draught, a rush of wind, pervaded the hut, the whole habitation vibrated, and, amid a din of unearthly noises, the shadow of his wife's father descended and stood as a reflection upon the wall of the hut ! Claude merely willed the spirit to appear. His wish was transmitted by animal magnetism to the wand, and thence, by spirit magnetism or sympathy, to the spirit, world, the wand being magnetically drawn in whatever direction the required spirit dwelt. The shadow looked frowningly upon Claude, as a voice, which proceeded from the direction of the spirit, inquired \u2014 \" Wherefore do you summon me ? \" \" Pray excuse my audacity and boldness in calling upon one who was so harsh upon me in this world,\" answered Claude, in a slightly nervous tone. \" I wished to know if you were dead,\" added he. \"Dead! dead I am to this world,\" said the voice; \"but yet I live. Far away, fast anchored in the abyss of space, there is another world, round as the earth on which you dwell. Indeed, it is one of those bodies, I have no doubt, that you on this earth call stars and planets. There, there dwells a race of beings different altogether from those of your world \u2014 in form so beauti ful, in colour so bright, and altogether so glorious and"], [51, "43 CLAUDE CHANTEPEEDKIX. so foreign to the creatures of your earth that I could not invent words which would in any way convey to you an idea of their forms.

We. in our planet, can sail through the air and plunge in the recesses of the waters with like facility. In fact, the order of things here is completely reversed with us. We dwell principally in the waters, which. indeed, are not waters ; for they are not fluid, neither are they solid, for we are constantly floating here and there, backwards and forwards, in our abode. When we are not in the waters we are reclining and sailing on the air. But we never visit the land in our world except to bury our dead ; we regard it as a vale of death, always to be avoided. This land (which is the only way I can describe it to you) is not like yours. The things that you call Nature \u2014 for instance, trees, grass, shrubs and plants, fields and swards, are com posed of various metals of dazzling brightness, which, when the sun shines (unlike the metals of your world). grow dim. The metal trees spring up to an enormous height instantaneously, and then, by degrees, grow smaller, until they entirely disappear beneath the land's metallic surface. Here, beneath their light shedding branches, lie the remains of our departed"], [52, "44 LADY ROSALIND. fellow-creatures. Our habitations in the sea are com posed of a substance like your wood, and they grow large by degrees. They at first appear like an air bubble iu the bosom of the seas ; they swell con tinuously, and when they are large enough we take up our temporary abode in them. Still they continue swelling until finally they burst into nothingness, and we arc compelled to look out for another home. When any one of us dies, we place the corpse in an electric balloon, and several of us accompany it through the air to the land \u2014 or vale of death \u2014 where it is safely in terred. A curious bird, something like your humming bird, is the only animal-kind that resides in our sphere. Several of these birds are to be seen in each domicile ; and not only that, but they are more masters than we, for we are completely subservient to them. They speak and converse together, whilst we can only utter a dreary, solitary note, something akin to that which your wood-pigeon so much reiterates.\" Claude, at this juncture, thought that he heard some noise from without the hut ; but he was so interested in the revelations of the spirit that he would not dis miss it until the last moment ; and the spirit implored in piteous accents that Claude would not yet discharge him, explaining that the only relief they got in that distant globe was when they were summoned to the \u25a0earth where they formerly dwelt."], [53, "CHAPTER V. JACQUES REMBRANDT. O! fortune. O! ye sparkling gems. Presently the clatter of horses' hoofs was distinctly heard from without, and Claude, not wishing that his partner \u2014 whom he knew was now returning \u2014 should know anything of his powers of intercourse with the spirit world, abruptly dismissed the apparition with a wave of the wand. He sank down upon the stool on which he had been previously sitting and tried to assume an air of indifference and unconcern, in which he was fairly successful. He had scarcely done so when Jacques Rembrandt (for that was his partner's name), having put up his horse, unlocked and pushed open the door. There was a look of solicitude in the new-comer's face as he drew a stool towards the table and let himself drop into it with a thud which betokened fatigue. He was a man of about 35 years, of low stature, and burly. His eyes, which were sunken in his head, were small and red, and wore a quick, cunning, cat-like expression. His features were short"], [54, "46 LADY ROSALIND. and decidedly of the \" pug \" order ; his hair was a l-cddish -brown hue ; it was short and stood straight upon his head, like \" quills upon the fretful porcu pine.\" His countenance and general appearance were, on the whole, rather repellent than fascinating. These two men wore long, black cloaks, slouched, broad-leafed hats, jack boots, and round their waists they had broad belts, in which were plunged pistols and knives. This was the dress of all the diamond seekers. After a death-like silence of several minutes, uudis i urbed save by the whistling of the restless winds and the howling of wild beasts without, the younger man started suddenly up in his seat, drew his stool closer to where his companion was sitting, and, stretching over, he asked, in a whisper \u2014 \" Where are the diamonds ? \" He had been out during the day, while his partner was at home securing their prize, and this accounts for his interrogative. \" They are safe, Claude,\" replied Jacques, with a chuckle of satisfaction. \" But where ? Outside or inside ? \" inquired Claude Chanteperdrix, with an expression iff anxiety and eagerness. \" There \u2014 three feet in the earth, underneath that stone,\" returned his companion, as he pointed towards"], [55, "47 JACQUES REMBRANDT. a corner of the hut, to one of the flags with which the dwelling was floored. A sigh of relief escaped the lips of the younger man when he heard this, and he seemed to breathe more freely, and to be more at ease than before. '\" Fifty thousand pounds worth ! Fifty thousand pounds ! This has been a fortunate day for us, Jacques,\" said Claude, as he tried to quiet his spirit, which had been so much moved by the revelations of the shadow. \"Ay, Ay,\" replied Jacques. \"We have worked hard, and for a very, very long time \u2014 for years, years of cruel exile and hardship in all forms ; but it is a consolation to think that the day of luck has at last arrived. But now that fortune has smiled upon us. now that we have secured this great prize, we had best lose no time in seeing after our own personal safety.\" \" And how can we best do that ? \" was the anxious interrogative of the junior partner. \u25a0' By flying hence at ouce, with as little delay as possible. The longer we stay here the more we endanger our lives. We must not let the time slip.

That's the question. Where do you wish to go ? \" inquired Rembrandt. \" Where should I wish to go but to the land from whence, five years ago, I was driven \u2014 ah, yes, most cruelly and wrong-fully driven, only to fall into this den of bloodthirsty villains, a crew of hybrid out casts. And what would I have done but for you, Jacques ? \" said Claude, in a tone of despondency. \" But it is all over now. The day of success has come at last, and if we can escape safely from this loathsome place I will retrace my steps, with all possible haste, to Ireland \u2014 to her.\" And here he buried his face in his hands, and burst forth into a fit of convulsive sobbing. \" Don't weep, don't weep, old fellow,\" said Rem brandt, in a consolatory tone ; and after a few"], [57, "49 JACQUES REMBRANDT. moments' pause he continued, \" I have long thought, Claude, although I never spoke on the subject, that there was something always troubling you; some hidden sorrow perpetually gnawing at your heart ; some great trial oppressing you. During all the time \u2014 almost five long years \u2014 that we have been together you have never opened your mind to me ; you have never told me of your past life, of your friends or relations, or by what chance you happened to come here. Yet could I read perturbation, grief, anxiety \u2014 aye, I would say blighted hope, and even disappointed love in every feature of your face. And not alone in your face could I see these indications ; you have been silent and gloomy by day (I don't remember to have ever seen you smile), and restless have you been by night. There are a kind of men so loose of soul, That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs. And such a one are you, Claude. Many a sleepless night have I watched you, tossing and muttering as you slept ; and in all your ravings the pervading sub jects of your unconnected utterances were, as well as I could understand, something in connection with a false signature, and about the wife you had to leave, well nigh broken-hearted, behind you.\" At this point Claude Chanteperdrix started up, turned E"], [58, "50 LADY ROSALIND. deadly pale, and paced the hut with rapid, impatient steps. \" Claude, why did you not tell me of all your troubles ? \" continued Jacques Rembrandt ; \" I, too, have had mine, and I know that there is no greater relief when one is so oppressed than to open their mind and heart to a congenial, sympathizing spirit. This will be our last night here, and in a few days more we may be parted for ever.

Claude Chanteperdrix reseated himself, and drew his stool closer towards the table. \" Jacques,\" said he, \" mine has been a hard and bitter lot. Two months before I came to this den I held an excellent position in a bank in a certain part of Ireland ; in fact, in a short time I was to have been appointed mauager, at a salary of eight or nine hundred a year. But fate arranged things otherwise. A certain young gentleman, a very intimate friend of mine, to whom I was much attached, came to me at the bank one day. (Oh ! would to God I had never lived to see that accursed day.) He explained to me that he was in a great fix for a considerable sum of money. He had been betting and lost -the horse he had backed heavily fell and broke its neck. He knew that I had more than ordinary powers as a penman, and that I could, unfortunately for myself, forge almost any signature I once saw, and so he presented me with a bill for the amount of his loss, and conjured me by all our ties of friendship to sign a wealthy depositor's name"], [60, "52 LADY ROSALIND. across the draft, and thus save him, as he said, from ' destruction.' At the same time he swore a mighty oath that he would make it all right, so far as I was concerned, in a few weeks time. I hesitated for a long time, but his entreaties were so earnest that I at length consented to write the name. He got the money, and saved himself ; but he never thought of saving me ! The forgery was detected ; there was a sworn inquiry into the matter.

But, hardest fate of all, and what has caused me such pain and remorse, was the parting with my young wife, to whom I had been but three months married. I could not bring her with me, for reasons which I will presently explain. She was young, beautiful, and of high family. I fell in love with her; I could not bear her out of my sight.

We got married privately, one reason for doing so being that if we did so publicly, and in open defiance of the com mands of my wife's father, who was a morose old aentleman, he might deprive her of the very large fortune which would otherwise be hers. But, oh ! Jacques, the disgrace, the ignominy that that signature brought on, just as I was about getting such a good position ; and then the heart-breaking parting with her I loved so dearly.\" \" Claude,\" said Rembrandt, who had listened with absorbing interest to all that Chanteperdrix had nar rated, \" if I were you, now that you have plenty of money.

I will explain. I am of French origin \u2014 noble French blood oourses through my veins. I was an only child, and when I was but a boy my father went to Ireland, and there in the capital he carried on for many years, on a very extensive scale, the business of bit and spur manufacturer. He was at all times decidedly demo cratic in his views, and he had not been long in Ireland when he joined the old Irish Volunteer Corps. When going through the country he came into contact with a member of a certain ancient French family, whose ancestors were ever at variance with those of my father \u2014 feuds continually raged between them. This gentleman with whom he met had been always taught to hate our family, and being of a vindictive turn of mind he, after meeting my father, sent word privately to Dublin Castle that there were pikes and other arms hidden beneath the forge in the workshop attached to my father's business premises \u2014 a most outrageous and malicious fabrication. However, a few weeks subse quently, one morning as my father was sitting with my mother at the breakfast table at home, a servant entered the room, and announced that two gentlemen at the hall door wished to speak to my father. He."], [63, "FORGIVING AND UNFORGIVING. 55 without any preparation, stood up and left the room. My mother waited and waited and waited, but he never returned.

Weeks passed, months passed, but no clue to his whereabouts could be obtained, until one day my mother \u2014 who, by this time, was well-nigh dis tracted \u2014 accidentally passing through the Castle yard, saw a white pocket-handkerchief waving from one of the high narrow cell windows, on the east flank of the square. You know the place I allude to, Claude ? \" \" Yes, yes,\" answered Claude, impatient to hear the rest of the narrative. \" My mother knew,\" continued Rembrandt, \"who it was that waved that handkerchief. She responded, and, without losing any time, she hastened to the authorities and begged the favour of an interview with my father. All her entreaties were in vain ; she knew not what to do. At last an idea dawned upon her mind that she would wait at the entrance to the Castle, and when the Lord-Lieutenant would be riding through she would throw herself on her knees before him and implore of him that she might be even allowed to see her husband. She did so, only to be laughed to scorn by His Excellency and staff. My father (Oh, God! it maddens me to think on it) took fever in prison, and died in two weeks. My mother died shortly after of a"], [64, "56 LADY ROSALIND. broken heart, and I was thrown at an early age upon the obdurate, unpitying world. I have been always, during my whole life, seeking an opportunity for revenge upon the man who murdered my parents (I cannot use any milder expression) for mere spite by telling the most dastardly, unmitigated falsehoods ; but never, owing to my want of wealth, have I been able, surreptitiously and unknown, to come into quarters with him, by mixing in that class of society where I would be sure to meet him. But now I have money, whose want was my only drawback, and now will I retaliate.\" \"Yours is a sad story,\" interrupted Claude, \"but, perhaps, when you do return to the old country, you may not be able to find the gentleman ; he may have died since you came here. Ten years is a long time \u2014 time for mpny changes and vicissitudes. Indeed, regarding my own case, I feel a presentiment over me that I will never again see my wife. I feel convinced either that she will be dead or that I will never land safely in Ireland. Perhaps it is mere fancy \u2014 a mere depression of the spirits ; but, however it be, so I feel. If I ever do arrive in Ireland, unlike you, revenge will be the farthest thought from my mind.

What do you think of retiring to rest ? \" \" Ay, ay,\" said Rembrandt, \" we will require it ; we have a long and anxious journey before us to-morrow night.\" Thus was the conversation abruptly terminated, and the two men retired to rest knowing more of one another than they had been able to learn during their five years' abode together in that African hut. But they retired less in sympathy with one another than they had ever been before during those long years of expatriation, for Rembrandt despised Claude for what he considered unmanliness, cowardice, and want of spirit, and Claude was filled with contempt for the man who could foster revenge within his breast, and work indefatigably for a life-time with no other end in view than retaliation and a craving for satisfaction for wrongs which, if time could not efface, mercy should teach to forgive."], [66, "CHAPTER VII. DE FORDYKE HALL. Thou, Nature, art my goddess. In the South of Ireland, about six miles from the picturesque, historic, and romantic town of K \u2014 , sur rounded by a spacious demesne of woody wealth, at the period to which these pages refer, there stood a large and beautiful mansion, the appearance and structure of which would lead the spectator to believe that it was erected in the latter half of the last century. But, in truth, it was much older, for on one of the drawing-room windows there were distinctly visible the letters and date, \" W. de F., 1481,\" cut or scratched with a sharp-pointed instrument upon the window-pane. This ancient dwelling \u2014 Built with turrets on a rising ground, And strong, and large, and picturesque around- if tradition tells aright, was the seat for many a long year of a noble and illustrious family of French descent, named De Fordyke, the sole remaining"], [67, "59 DE FORDYKE HALL. representative of which (the Lady Rosalind de For dyke) at present resided within its sombre walls. The house \u2014 a gloomy-looking oblong mass \u2014 was a three-storey building of massive, dark limestone, con taining no less than twenty-seven commodious apart ments. From the centre of the building a square-built castellated tower, erected principally for astronomical purposes, reared its stately form on high ; the passing clouds oft kissed its loftly pinnacles. A stone verandah in front, with heavy architrave and rich cornice, supported on massive columns of the Doric style, with elaborately-carved caps and bases, added to the imposing and tenebrose appearance of the building. The walls were everywhere covered with creeping wild rose, large-leaved ivy (for which that part of the country was famed), trailing luscious woodbine, and fragrant clematis, whose perfume ever floated upon the balmy air. The walls throughout were six feet thick. some being hollow, with secret passages leading to secret doors in certain rooms. From the kitchen in the basement there was a trap door down into dark vaults, in which a gaseous, deadly vapour infected the air. The dark and dismal walls glistened with an unwholesome moisture. From the vaults there were two subterraneous passages, clammy and chill, one to the town of K \u2014 , and the other to a"], [68, "60 LADY ROSALIND. small hamlet, which could boast of but few inhabitants, about a mile-and-a-half east of the demesne on which the De Fordyke mansion was situate. Few had ever ventured through those passages, for it was whispered abroad that sights most horrible \u2014 spectres dire \u2014 in fested the place ; rats of unnatural size, with fiery glance, darted back and forward through the gloom ; human skeletons, too, were said to be there; nay, 'tis even said that ghosts stalked to and fro, held converse there, and laughed and wailed in fiendish fashion. However, let the cause be what it may, the fact re mains that these subterraneous passages had not been entered by mortal for many a long year, save by the present Lady Rosalind's late father, of whom more will be disclosed. The environments of this weird-like habitation were striking, none the less for their sad, not to say melan choly, aspect, than for their wild and sylvan beauty. A long avenue, leading from the roadside up to the entrance door of the building, was studded on either side by sombre, luxuriantly-foliaged lime-trees, amid the thick-set branches and rustling leaves of which a thousand crows sat croaking ominously during all times and all seasons.

Within this vast manor, sylvan scenes, grotesque and wild \u2014 Nature's pictures, unsullied by the aits of man \u2014 everywhere abounded ; in sooth, it was a rustic paradise. Crystal rivulets, amber, lucid streams and gargling brooks wound their mystic way from the mountain heights, and in their labyrinthic course exercised their vivifying and fertilizing influence on all they passed. Facing the west gable of the house there was an orchard, whose rich trees, laden with blossoms and delicious, nectarine fruits, wept sweetest odours ; while to the east lay gardens thronged with flowers of every hue \u2014 rosemary, fennel, pansies, columbine, carnations, and The marigold that goes to bed wi' the sun, And with him rises weeping. Nor were there wanting shrubs of any sort ; flowery arborets and bowers overgrown with gently-creeping evergreens. In the middle of these gardens there was an arti ficial pond, enclosed with shining rocks and inhabited"], [70, "62 LADY ROSALIND. by gold-fish. In its centre a crystal fountain ever played with soft murmuring sound. The pond over flowed into a flowery brook that wound its mazy course to the top of a steep precipice, from whence its waters dashed down cliffs, from ledge to ledge, with noise terrific, which gradually died away in the dark depths beneath until it was heard no more. Encircling all this beauty there was a shady grove running around the outskirts of the demesne, which was known as the \" Lady Rosalind's Walk,\" because of the frequency with which she traced and retraced her steps along its winding course \u2014 Under oaks and elms, Whose outspread branches over-arch'd the glade. On each side of this walk were trees of all sorts and sizes, whose boughs and graceful foliage met overhead, thick-shading the grove \u2014 - Laburnum, rich In streaming gold; syringa, ivory pure; The scentless and the scented rose ; this red And of an humbler growth, the other tall And throwing up into the darkest gloom Of neighbouring cypress, or more sable yew, Her silver lobes, light as the foamy surf That the wind severs from the broken wave ; The lilac, various in array, now white, Now sanguine, and her beauteous head now set With purple spikes pyramidal, as if Studious of ornament, yet unresolved Which hue she most approvVI, she chose them all ;"], [71, "63 DE FORDYKE HALL.

From this grove, through the trees, could be seen the embattled tower of the Hall, from whence the strains of the wind-played harp, swelling and waning upon the breeze, were distinctly heard. And here \u2014 The redbreast warbled still, but was content With slender notes, and more than half suppressed. Stillness, accompanied with sounds so soft, Charmed more than silence. Meditation here Might think down hours to moments. Such was the romantic and sequestered abode which Lady Rosalind's great-grandfather, the Marquis Wm. de Fordyke, purchased and settled down in, many, many years ago, shortly after his arrival in Ireland from his motherland \u2014 France ; and here the Lady Rosalind now led a secluded and solitary life.

Our hearts recall the distant day With many sighs ; The moments that are speeding fast We heed not, but the past \u2014 the past \u2014 More highly prize. It was a beautiful day in August. It had rained during the morning, but now the sun was shining brightly, tinging all nature with a golden hue. The trees wore a freshened aspect ; the silvery streams rippled merrily along ; the rain-drops glistened like pearls on the tiny grass blades of the lawns and meadows, and \u2014 The breath of some thousand flowers, Sweeter after gentle showers, Perfumed the air. The faithful old Jean Tuppitt was pursuing his usual occupation in the magnificent gardens attached to De Fordyke Hall.

F"], [74, "66 LADY ROSALIND. It was not hard to conclude, after once seeing and speaking to him, that Jean, in his time, had seen better days, and that he once belonged to a rank much higher than that which his present calling would indicate. He was once tall and handsome, with large, dark-blue eyes, aquiline features, and black, silken hair, but age and hard service had told its wonted story. He now wore a worn and haggard appearance ; his hair long and white, his form weak and bent, his face impressed with many a scar. He had been for many years a soldier, at one time ranking as lieutenant. He took part in many engagements, both on land and at sea \u2014 many a blood-curdling tale could he tell of the battle.

He was passionately fond of gardening ; he loved flowers of all sorts, and consequently he was often seen busily engaged over the flowers and shrubs. Such was his occupation on the occasion in question. and as he worked he thought \u2014 aye, even grieved \u2014 over the sad state of melancholy into wrhich the Lady Rosalind had fallen since the death of her father, which happened just two years ago. It was a sad, sad sight, he thought, to see such a young and hand some lady lapsing into such a despondent, dejected. and pitiable condition ; she who was wont to be so gay and cheerful ; she whose society was courted by lords and earls ; she who sought pleasure in its every form. He knew the Lady Rosalind from her childhood ; he had become very fond of her. Many a time, in her infant days, had he taken her ou his knee and told her .stories that gratified the yearnings of her childish heart. She grew fond of him.

Ah ! yes, alone and unconsoled ! For since her father's demise she had grown cold, almost repugnant, towards all her acquaintances and friends, and the coolness had become reciprocal. She had been strange in her manner at all times for some years past, but now her strangeness had developed, to all appearance, into the worst kind of hypochondria. Alone and unconsoled ! Yes, save for one, Colonel Victor de Burg, commander of the 5th Battalion of the King's Regiment, which was, at that time, stationed under canvas upon the mountain-side, some four miles distant from De Fordyke Hall. He loved her passionately ; he had made many protestations of his love. Since the death of the Major he had paid her marked attention, and it was even mooted that he had proposed for her. Howbeit, she treated him apparently with the greatest scorn and contempt ; rejected all his advances, and ultimately he ceased to be a visitor at the Hall. He had not been seen there for nearly twelve months \u2014 he whose visits were almost daily. Now she had no friends ; no sympathizing, consola tory soul ever visited her now; she was derelict.

He was about, to move towards another bed, when he descried her ladyship walking slowly towards him, or rather towards her favourite walk, near the entrance to which he was at that time standing ; and, fearing to disturb her by his presence \u2014 for he knew she could not bear to meet anyone \u2014 he slipped gently behind some neighbouring shrubbery, and escaped her view.

She had a tall, stately figure, symmetrical in all its"], [78, "70 LADY ROSALIND. parts ; she was always careless regarding her dress. and on the present occasion she was shrouded in a loose, ill-fitting black silk habiliment. She was but twenty-four years of age, but to judge from her appearance she seemed fully ten years older. so careworn was the expression of her face \u2014 a face which by its noble, beautiful outline, fixes the atten tion. It was a face expressive of unfortunate love ; it was the face of one who had felt the power of love, which still was nourished by the sweet recollections of the beloved object. Her features were very beautiful. Her skin was as white and as smooth as alabaster, yet did her cheeks glow with the tint of the rose, and the ruddiness of her arched lips indicated that she was full of health. Albeit, her skin was so beautifully fair, her waving locks of hair, her eyebrows and her eyes were dark, very dark, though not exactly black. Her ex pression of countenance was very mobile, changing constantly as her quickly susceptible heart and imagi native mind were affected by any passing events in which she took an active part.

She was in a brooding, sadly-meditating mood ; and the twilight, ever sacred to deep and solemn thought, spread its dreamy influence over her mind. There is something in its strange silence that elevates the human soul ; it is the magic hour at which all men think ; and now its influence, combined with the musical murmur from the brooks and rippling streams, wrapt the lady's soul in a pensive sadness. A look of deep thought, most painfully deep and abstracted, hung upon her brow. She had g-one round her walk once, and now she moved slowly, with measured step, towards the foun tain side, and here seated herself upon a mossy bank.

Thus he went away in a hopeful mood, still trusting that in a future interview he would meet with the desired success.

Hope went arm in arm with him on his eventide walk, whispering many flattering tales in his eager ear. Little thought he that, so far as his winning the heart of Lady Rosalind was concerned, his hopes were doomed to utter disappointment. Lady Rosalind stood mutely watching the Colonel's figure as it receded quickly in the darkness, and when it disappeared, she lapsed into her thoughtful mood again, just as if no such episode had intervened.

The day after the night on which they arranged for their escape, was passed in the usual way \u2014 digging and shooting ; but the evening, which was eagerly watched for by both, was spent in preparations for their long and hazardous journey, a journey on which they had not only to guard against their fellow diamond-seekers, but also against the wild beasts that roved night and day through the surrounding woods and Savannas. They shut and barricaded the door of the hut as soon as it grew dark, and then set to work to dig up the diamonds. They did so by the light of their fire and the dim taper that burned upon their rudely con structed table \u2014 without disturbance.

This done they had little else to take with them from that dreary habitation. Gathering up beast skins to cover their horses, and pistols and daggers to protect themselves, they gave a last long look around the hut, and then crept cautiously and silently to the door. As they did so Claude hung a little behind his companion in order to snap up the wand and place it in his bosom.

It's dangerous for us to linger here.\" They groped their way by the back of the hut to where they had their horses tied up in readiness. Having thrown the furs over them and seen that the coast was clear, they mounted, and before many minutes had elapsed were galloping across a wide tract of bare country at the top of their speed. Silently they rode on. never daring to look back or to pause for a moment. They could not, however, keep up this pace very long without running the risk of tiring out their steeds ; but on seeing the outskirts of a wood looming in the distant darkness they deter mined not to slacken their speed until they reached it. At length they came to the skirts of the wood, and now they ventured to dismount. They were about to fasten their horses to one of the trees, spread their rough rugs and rest awhile, but Rembrandt, on putting his ear to the ground, thought that he heard the distant thud of horses' hoofs against the earth. He imme diately called Claude's attention to the fact ; the latter put his ear to the earth, and almost instantly exclaimed that they were being followed fast, for the clatter of hoofs became louder and louder. What should they do ? At first they were uncertain ; but on consideration they concluded that their safest course was to remain where they were ; and silently"], [87, "A SECRET FLIGHT. 79 wait until the approaching horsemen had passed by, and then take another course towards the town of H . They waited almost breathless ; the clatter continued for a considerable time, and then by degrees grew less distinct until it ultimately died away. They were now in as great perplexity as before, for they could not tell which way their pursuers had directed their course, or whether they might not, like themselves, be resting at no great distance away. Jacques and Claude decided, however, to still keep quiet and rest themselves for a short time at least. Presently they were alarmed by the threatening growl of some wild animal quite close by them. Without hesitation the two travellers hurriedly collected some twigs and leaves that were scattered around, and Claude, striking a flint, set fire to the pile. It blazed up at once, and by its light was seen a huge hy\u00e6na crouching like a cat, and evidently prepared to spring upon Rembrandt. Claude drew a pistol and fired at the animal, killing it; and now several beasts, they knew not of what kind, were seen making away in all directions, howling furiously. Were it not that they had presence of mind to kindle the sticks, they would, in all probability, have been torn to pieces. To stay there longer would have been dangerous ; Claude again put his ear to the earth, and finding all"], [88, "80 LADY ROSALIND. silent, himself and companion remounted and rode slowly through the mazy wood. After about three hours' riding they came, un molested, to the verge of the forest-land, and as they made their advent therefrom they beheld, by the grey light which was already breaking through the clouds, a wide river whose rapid waters they would have to ford. When they arrived at the river they both plunged in, and after a desperate struggle with the rushing waters, in which their horses were almost jaded, they succeeded in reaching the opposite bank. They now dismounted and led their horses by the bridle for a considerable distance. All fear was past ; the night was over, and the morning grew clearer and clearer, and the travellers felt themselves safe at last. The remainder of their journey was through flat country, and joy filled their hearts \u2014 temporarily, at least \u2014 when towards the close of the day they descried at some distance, in a sloping direction beneath them, the houses and streets of the town of H as thev glittered 'neath the rays of the wanino- sun."], [89, "CHAPTER XL GAMING AND QUARRELLING. That you have wronged me, it doth well appear. It was almost dark when two travellers arrived, tired and weary, at the seaj:>ort town of H \u2014 . Having sold their horses, disposed of some of the diamonds in order to supply their present necessities, changed their African attire for more rational and less attractive habiliments, and inquired at what time the vessel started for England next day, they procured lodging accommodation for the night. The vessel did not leave port until the following evenino-, and they then embarked direct for England, with a view to proceeding to London, and thence to Ireland. The passengers in question were Claude and Rembrandt. It was a calm, clear night, and Claude enjoyed its sad stillness, which was in accord with his present frame of mind, after the turmoil and perturbation of the last two days. He paced slowly, with firm step, up and down the deck, while his companion preferred G"], [90, "82 LADY ROSALIND. to stay, with many other passengers, smoking, chatting, and gaming in the cabin. Claude was alone on deck, at least, so far as his fellow-passengers were concerned, and all was com paratively silent, save for the frequent outbursts of laughter which rang forth from the cabin, and the rough voice of the captain \u2014 pacing his deck above \u2014 which was clearly heard at intervals, now giving orders to the lieutenant of the watch, and now addressing words of caution or reprimand to the helmsman. The vessel was gallantly gliding over the crested waves, parting them with her prow and dashing to either side their glittering drops in snowy jets of spray, and yielding with grace to every undulation of the heaving billows. The moon was sailing majesti cally in a broad field of blue, high in the eastern sky, unobscured by a single cloud. On all sides the waves leaped towards\" it upwards, to fall back into the crystal shining sea in showers of silver, and brightness and serenity reigned. Claude grew weary of thinking, and in order to stifle the unpleasant thoughts that crowded upon him, he descended to the cabin and joined in the gambling. Soon afterwards all the passengers retired to rest, but Rembrandt, who (while Claude was on deck) had lost considerably, was only warming to his work, and"], [91, "83 GAMING AND QUARRELLING. insisted that Claude should play on with him. Claude consented to do so, and faro was the game selected. There they gambled on, playing for the diamonds which they had been fortunate to find \u2014 gambled on as they used to do during the many weary nights which they spent in the African hut ; gambled on l'ecklessly as many a rich man has done, until from being perchance a millionaire he has been reduced to beggary, and in desperation and despair he has made away with his life, aye, his soul. It would be useless to follow in detail the many games of faro that Chanteperdrix and Rembrandt played, suffice it to say that they became more and more excited as they went on, and that Claude was fast losing his diamonds. Naturally anxious to recoup his losses he played on and on, until finally, to the great amusement of his confrere, he lost every stone of his so lately-acquired fortune. He had now lost everything of which he was pos sessed ! What was he to do ? Here in a few hours he was dispossessed of the fruits of his five years of bodily and mental labour in exile ! How could he return to Ireland, as penniless as he had been when he left it? How could he face the scorn, the contempt, perhaps the penury, which awaited him there? Penury, for he knew not but"], [92, "84 LADY ROSALIND. that his wife might have confessed to her father at his dying bed that she was the wife of Claude Chanteper drii in opposition to the old man's will ; and might he not on this aocount have cut her off with a shilling (for he was a callous, irascible old man) ? It would be foolish for him to dream of returning if such were the case. Perhaps, too, on his arrival he might find that his wife had been married to someone else during his long absence, thinking he was dead ; and if this were the case (which he doubted very much) he would not destroy her happiness by making known his identity. He would rather, a thousand times, return to the hated diamond-fields than do so. These thoughts rushed like the lightning's flash through Claude's brain, and with them came thoughts as to how he could win back some of the diamonds. He knew that it would be useless to importune Rem brandt to give him a chance to win back, and he saw that there was only one way out of the difficulty : His wife's father was dead, and on the supposition of the devolution of his property upon his daughter-, Claude concluded that the property (being his wife's) was consequently his. Accordingly he determined to make one great venture. Having procured pen, ink, and paper, he told Rembrandt that he would now play him another game, putting at stake his wife's property in Ireland"], [93, "GAMING AND QUARRELLING. 85 (what that property was need not here be told), in the hope of gaining back even some of his heavy losses, and that he was about to draw up a deed handing over the said property to Rembrandt, which he would give him if he lost the game ; understanding at the same time that if he won he should get two-thirds of his diamonds back from his opponent. \" Your wife's property ! Did you not tell me that her father was alive ? How, then, could the property be yours or hers ? \" said Rembrandt, in a derisive tone. \" I tell you her father is now dead, and that the property is my wife's, and consequently mine,\" an swered Claude, testily, annoyed that Rembrandt should doubt his veracity. He was also annoyed at the sud denly cool, gibing manner in which his partner treated him since he commenced to lose. \" I don't believe you,\" said Jacques, in a sneering tone ; \"you say this for the sole purpose of my giving you a chance of winning what is justly mine.\" \" Don't believe me ! \" exclaimed Claude. \" Say that again, you vile wretch, and I won't be accountable for what may follow ! Is this the way you treat me after you have beggared me ? \" and he grasped the handle of his dagger, and rushed towards Rembrandt. \" Put up your dagger,\" said the latter, \" I would not quarrel with you ; but what proof have I got that such a property exists at all ? \""], [94, "86 LADY ROSALIND. \" Do you not believe my word ? Am I not an honour able man ? \" questioned Claude, excitedly. \" Honourable man ! \" laughed Rembrandt, scornfully. as he rose to his feet from the gambling table. \" You call yourself an honourable man ? You who, according to your account, are an exiled forger, and I know not what else besides.\" \"Nay, tempt me no further,\" shouted Claude, pale with passion. \" How dare you \u2014 you above all persons \u2014 throw this in my teeth ? If I am a forger, I have the consolation \u2014 small though it be \u2014 of knowing that I served a friend ; but you \u2014 you wretch ! How many men have you sent by your hand to a bloody grave ? How many men have you murdered to gain a few paltry diamonds ? Aye, and sent to an untimely judg ment these men will cry to heaven for vengeance upon their murderer.\" \" Enough, enough,\" cried Rembrandt, stung to the quick by his companion's words. \" Draw up this deed. and swear that what you say is true ; then and then only will I give you the chance you have asked for.\" Claude could hardly restrain his feelings of indigna tion at being asked to swear that his statement was correct. He, however, drew up the deed in silence, and when he had it finished he called upon God to witness the truth of his asseveration. Little did he think that had he sworn twenty oaths instead of one Rem-"], [95, "87 GAMING AND QUARRELLING. brands would not have believed him \u2014 in fact, so incredu lous was the latter, that when Claude handed him the deed he did not even look at it ; and although he con sented to giving him the chance, he was determined, by fair means or foul, that Claude should not win ! One game was to decide. It was played with intense earnestness, and \u2014 whether Rembrandt cheated or not would be a hard question to answer \u2014 Claude lost again ! Rembrandt took up the deed and put it in his pocket, while Claude, without opening his lips, arose and walked quietly out of the cabin. His companion never offered to stop him, thinking that he was merely sulky after the words that had passed between them, and that he meant to cool his temper by pacing the deck. How beit, Jacques did not trouble himself further about Claude, but retired soon afterwards to his berth, and slept as if no such storm of words and threats had passed between them ! He did not, however, enjoy his sleep long, for soon the cry of \" A man overboard ! \" sounded and re-rang in his ears. Without a moment's hesitation he sprang from his berth (his eyes still heavy with sleep), and in the twinkling of an eye he was up on the deck. All was excitement on board. The captain was shouting commands to his men ; the lifeboats were being lowered, and there was a general rush towards one side of the vessel."], [96, "88 LADY ROSALIND. Rembrandt pushed his way to the front, and, look ing over the side, he saw by the light of the moon Claude tossing as' if senseless upon the waves, his face upturned and pale as death, his long dark hair wet and dragging in the water, while his eyes were per fectly closed. Before the boats had time to touch the waves, Rem brandt, wild with fear, or excitement, or worse, threw off his outer garments (which he had not removed when going to his berth) and plunged headlong into the ocean, coming down just beside Claude. Many were the cries of encouragement and acclama tion that assailed his ears. \" Bravo ! bravo ! \" was the general shout of the sailors as he struggled in the waves beneath. Almost immediately the two figures in the water disappeared, and after a few minutes (which seemed hours to those on board the vessel and in the boats) Rembrandt came to the surface, ex hausted, pale as a sheet, and bearing in his right hand the belt of diamonds which Claude had around his waist, but which he had not previously given up to the winner. Rembrandt, well nigh-fainting with weakness, was taken into one of the boats, and thence conveyed on board. When he got there he pulled himself together as much as possible, and carelessly fastened the belt around his waist, amidst congratulations with which"], [97, "GAMING AND QUARRELLING. 89 he was greeted on all sides for the pluck he had shown. Those around him, of course, never suspected that the belt was not his own, or that it contained diamonds ; indeed, it is hardly probable that they cast a thought upon it at all. And why should they ? It was not an improbable thing that a man's belt should become loosened in such an action, and that he should be now putting it on again. \"My best friend drowned!\" said Rembrandt to the captain, who was supporting him to the cabin. \" I'll never, never have such a friend again,\" he added, in a broken .voice, as he sat down in the cabin, leaned his arms on the table, and buried his face in his hands. The first spasm of grief seeming to have passed away, Rembrandt sat up, and proceeded to narrate in faltering accents how, when he reached the water, his comrade sank, and how he, diving after him, caught him by the coat, which tore, and Claude sank further and further beneath his reach ; and finally how he had much ado to save himself. The captain here and there inserted a word of sympathy and condolence with Rembrandt, as the latter spoke in feeling terms of his \" dear friend whom he should never see again.\" The former now arose to leave, in order to pass some commands to his lieutenants, promising to return"], [98, "90 LADY ROSALIND. shortly. He accordingly left the cabin, closing the door after him, and thus leaving Rembrandt alone. \" Alone at last ! \" hissed Rembrandt, half aloud. \" So, Chanteperdrix, you thought to do me out of my diamonds, did you ? But I was a little too smart for you ! You called me a murderer ; perhaps you would have reason to do so now ! If you had been a little more civil to me this evening I would not have thrust you to the bottom ! The deed ! the deed ! \" he ex claimed, suddenly thinking of that document, \" there must be more truth in that than I expected, or Claude would not have thrown himself into the ocean after I had won the game.\" So muttering, Rembrandt pulled the paper from the pocket of his coat (which lay beside him on the table) and opened it hurriedly. His eyes sped from line to line of the deed ; he scrutinized it, every word, and the further he went the more it seemed to please him. \" I'll have my revenge at last,\" he murmured, \" this deed must be genuine. No wonder he threw himself into the water ! But I care not about him. I'll have my revenge now to the fullest. I'm in luck's way to get this document ; I'd plunge to my neck in human gore to get it ! What need I care then about one human life ? I can nowr accomplish the object of my life \u2014 revenge ! revenge ! \""], [99, "GAMING AND QUARRELLING. 91 The captain now re-entered the cabin, and Rem brandt, feigning great grief, bade him \"good-night,\" and went away to his berth, to all appearance in a very despondent mood. The remainder of the voyage to London was very quiet, during wrhich Rembrandt was heartily condoled with for the loss of his friend. The vessel having safely arrived, we will leave Rembrandt in London, and, returning to De Fordyke Hall, watch the development of events there."], [100, "CHAPTER XII. A ROOM OF MYSTERY. THE SHEETED DEAD From doubts and scruples thy soul be free, Nor hell nor devil have terrors for thee ! It was far into the night, and all was silent at De Fordyke Hall. Lady Rosalind, according to her long-established custom, was seated at a massive oaken desk in her study \u2014 a room of mysteries and charms \u2014 which was situated at the top of the tower in the centre of the building. The chamber was a lofty, narrow, Gothic apartment; the walls were hung with richly-embroidered, though faded, tapestry ; and the furniture, antique and cum brous, was carved in quaint designs. Here night after night for years had the lady's father read and studied subjects profound and abstruse ; here had he tried to probe into secrets and mysteries beyond the comprehension of man, until by their con tinued contemplation he almost lost his mind. From this chamber, also, he nightly watched the changes of \u2014 The crescent moon, the diadem of night ;"], [101, "A ROOM OF MYSTERY. THE SHEETED DEAD. 9S And observed the stars rolling within their mazy orbits \u2014 Stars countless, each in his appointed place, Past anchor'd in the deep abyss of space. \" Comets importing change of times and states,\" too, when they appeared, were closely tracked by him. Here, also, it is stated, he held concourse with spirits from the other world \u2014 here and in the subterraneous passages of the mansion. The sounds of strange, weird music and unearthly nocturnal revelry were often heard proceeding from the direction of the Major's chamber, which no mortal being was ever known to enter during his life save himself. They say he led a charmed life. The Lady Rosalind was now the sole occupier of this apartment, and she, so far at least as scientific inquiry and research were concerned, followed closely in her father's footsteps. She was a deep philosopher ; law she had studied profoundly; astronomy's paths and theology's dreary deserts had she roved ; nor were the mysteries of medicine unknown to her. Around her, as she sat in her solitary bower, were piles of soiled and musty books, gnawed by the devour ing moth, and smoke-stained papers covered with dust. Here and there were secret chests, with private drawers, secured with spring locks ; numerous instruments of"], [102, "94 LADY ROSALIND. science, and phials filled with strange distillations, were strewn about confusedly ; skeletons of birds and beasts stood round, aye, even human skeletons and hollow skulls were there. Although Lady Rosalind had a volume open before her upon the desk, she read not \u2014 she seemed to be in a state of unrest. Her raven locks fell loosely over her shoulders, and her ever-piercing eyes were aglow with more than ordinary fire. Her whole form seemed to thrill with emotion, as if some violent mental struggle raged within her brain; nay, even touched her very soul. She turned over the pages of her book with restless rapidity, stopped suddenly and glanced slowly round the room, then buried her face in her hands and wept silently. At last, raising her head, she cast a complaisant, piteous look upon a skull which lay beside her upon the desk. Gazing intently upon it, thus she spoke \u2014 \"Alas! poor skull! what wisdom, what intellect, what God-like qualities may have been here enthroned ! Yet, now how repelling, how abhorrent thou art ! Why may you not have been a statesman, with diamond mind, whose silver-tongued oratory sank deep into the heart, and swayed the mind of a mighty nation ? Yet now how silent, how helpless ! Why may you not have been a minister of God, whose words of wisdom"], [103, "95 A ROOM OF MYSTERY. THE SHEETED DEAD. and advice fell upon the ears and touched the very souls of many an erring spirit ? But now thou art no more, death struggled with and conquered thee ! Why not a musician, fantastical, whose powerful composi tions, whose melodies and harmonies charmed and held enthralled a thousand kindred spirits, and won an everlasting fame for thee ? Yet, now, where be your fame and greatness ? Why may you not have been a weary, heart-sick actor, who strutted and declaimed before a thankless, insatiable audience ? Ah, me ! if so, happier thy spirit to have dispossessed this bony, narrow prison. Now thou art free from the world's contagion. Why may you not have been a soldier, haughty, vain-glorious, and proud of transitory honours and bubble achievements, \" full of strange oaths and bearded like a pard, jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, seeking the bubble, reputation, even in the cannon's mouth ? \" Or why may you not have been a doctor, your brains on the rack studying the cells and cavities of such a skull as thine is now ? Would that I knew what thou wert ! Yet, what matters that ? Thou art now but an empty shell, a mere nothing. \" Would that I were in thy place, and thou in mine ! To this favour might I bring myself, even in the next few moments, did I but drain this phial of its potent contents.\""], [104, "96 LADY ROSALIND. Here the lady clutched convulsively a little bottle filled with a deadly draught. \"But soft ! \" she cried, dashing the phial from her, \" I'll not do it, and yet I would if I were sure of my spirit's immediate flight to regions of happiness.

Then comes an awful silence \u2014 a silence unlike all other silence of this world \u2014 deep, prolonged, mysterious, unbroken \u2014 a silence that seems to deepen with the lengthening of the years.

It grinned and leered in diabolical fashion, and ere descending from its smoky chariot it vomited blue flames, which immediately assumed multifarious demoniacal forms and floated away on the magic air. \" Worm of earth ! Abhorred mortal ! Why do you call me hence ? I hate and scorn your race, yet must I obey. Your will, lady ? \" demanded the spirit. Lady Rosalind trembled and shuddered from head to foot as she said \u2014 \" If you, oh, nameless thing ! can reveal the secrets of the world beyond, oh, let me hear them ! Tell me why it is that I cannot probe into the mysteries of the future ? Why is man here at all if, having mastered all earthly science, he cannot learn the secrets of his spirit and know that spirit's destination ? \" \" Ha ! ha ! ha ! \" chuckled the spirit. \" These things, all, wrill I reveal to you, but on one condition.

Adieu ! \" So saying, the spirit disappeared, sailing upwards on his smoky chariot ; and as he vanished, the mocking laughter which had heralded his coming pealed forth again and again, followed, in turn, by the most piteous sobbing and inhuman wailing. Then followed a lull, and Lady Rosalind was again alone \u2014 alone save for the company of melancholy and deploring thoughts. She examined the ring which the spirit had thrown her \u2014 a massive gold one \u2014 turning it round and round. scrutinizing its every interstice. It was, to all appearance, the ring her father wore for many years before his death, but where could he be now ? and how could the spirit come by that same ring ? How could she find out whether it was or not her father's property ? There was only one way of doinc; so. She remembered that the late Lord and Major de Fordyke was buried with that ring on his finger. She decided to proceed immediately to her father's tomb in the small churchyard, about half-a-mile from"], [109, "A ROOM OF MYSTERY. THE SHEETED DEAD. 101 the Hall. He was buried in the family vault, into which she could easily get, and, once in, she thought there would be no difficulty in seeing if the ring was on his finger, for she recollected that the coffin in which he was interred had a glass lid, and Lady Rosalind, as we know, had all the courage of her race. She looked out through one of the chamber windows, aud, seeing- that it was a clear night \u2014 the moon shining brightly \u2014 she donned her outer garments, descended to the hall, opened the heavy, ponderous door, and in a few moments was on her way to the churchyard. At every step she increased her pace, hoping to reach the grave and return without being missed from the Hall. Through dell and coppice and field she hurried, and after some little time \u2014 whose minutes seemed as hours \u2014 she came within sight of the ruined, sepulchral mass \u2014 an old ivy-clad abbey \u2014 beneath whose sombre, dismal shadows many of her kin slumbered their last long sleep on earth. And now her steps wavered and her brain grew dizzy as she passed, in the moonlight, through the broken portal of that once-majestic structure. All was dark within. Upon the once-encaustic tiled floor her form no shadow traced ; nor did her faltering steps an echo wake within those huge, yet trembling walls. See her now as she stood at the head of the stone"], [110, "102 LADY\" ROSALIND. steps leading down to the tomb of her father \u2014 see her pale face and her flashing eyes ! See her as she descended the uneven steps ! See her as she bent over the leaden, glass-covered coffin of her father ! She did not sigh ; she did not weep. There she stood like one in a trance. Through a crevice in the high eastern tower of the abbey a solitary beam from the pale moon broke in, and, piercing the darkness like a silvery dart, fell full upon the face of the silent dead. The wind now whistled through the turrets above : the neighbouring oaks, swung by the sudden gusts of wind, groaned to their very trunks ; while, high amid the ebon shadows of the buttresses, the owl hooted hideously. Lady Rosalind glanced around the chill, damp vault, and quivered to think that she was alone in that ghastly place wdiere lay the preserved bones of her ancestors ! She well remembered the form and features of at least three or four of those who were there interred ; and at that moment she thought she saw them sit up in their coffins and glare at her with a fiery, terrible glance. She felt a chill creep through her veins, and so completely was she unnerved that she almost forgot the mission that brought her there. Presently, how ever, she came to herself a little, and turned her atten-"], [111, "A ROOM OF MY'STERY. \u2014 THE SHEETED DEAD. lOo tion to the cold, rigid features of her dead father, on whose face the moonbeams danced as if in mockery. In woe she threw herself upon her knees beside the coffin, and, bending down her head, she tried, through the glass, to see the left-hand of the corpse, on which she knew the ring would be if it were there at all. But the hand was partly covered by the shroud, and she could not see it. She was about to rise with a view to getting in another position over the dead, but \u2014 Oh! horror \u2014 in her confusion she accidentally leaned her hand too heavily on the glass lid. It broke ! Her hand went through and fell forcibly against the body. causing it to bend and sit almost upright in the leaden shell ! She sprang suddenly to her feet, her heart beating wildly with terror. Oh ! Gods, what ill-star guided her thence ! Would she were back at the Hall ! But Lady Rosalind was, as we have seen, a woman of determination, and would not leave until she had accomplished the object of her visit. Still trembling, she moved again towards the corpse, and replaced it in the coffin as gently as possible. And now for her terrible task. She lifted up the left hand and searched the cold, stiff fingers ; but there was no ring on them. She let the left hand fall and took up the right, and, as she did so, its icy coldness sent a chill almost to her shoulders. But the ring was not there."], [112, "104 LADY ROSALIND. She ran her hands along each side of the body, but with a like result. She was satisfied that Ilackado was right \u2014 that the ring he had given her was her father's. Her curiosity was sated. But where was her father's spirit ? and how did Ilackado come by the ring ? These were questions to her inscrutable \u2014 ques tions never to be answered. Having looked a long, last look at the withered body, she turned and hastened up the broken steps of the vault. When she reached the top she looked round, and there, beneath, she saw the red form of Ilackado watching her depart. He \u2014 if we may personify a spirit \u2014 cast a sidelong look at Lady Rosalind, ex claiming, in a shrill, unnatural voice \u2014 \"Ha! ha! incredulous mortal, perhaps you will be lieve my words in future.\" Lady Rosalind quickened her pace towards the Hall, and after a little time she arrived there and made her way to her study, heedless and unheeded."], [113, "CHAPTER Xlll. WITH IHE IMMORTALS. In Nature's infinite book of secrecy A little I can read. If was the appointed night, and Lady Rosalind was sitting in her studyT awaiting impatiently the coming of the spirit whose appearance so terrified her but a few uights jireviously. Yet now she felt no thrill of fear ; she was perfectly intrepid regarding his coming. She thought not of her books, her papers, or her scientific pursuits. She was restive and feverish, and she longed to have her fortune told \u2014 to see into futurity ; for although she now knew that her life was, to some extent, a charmed one, still was she anxious about her future. She began to feel sorry that she had had any intercourse with the spirit; but she concluded that \u2014 To mourn a mischief that is past aud gone Is the next way to draw new mischief ou. And, in sad truth, she thought that anything at all would be better than the peaking and pining existence that she was eking out among worthless old books"], [114, "106 LADY ROSALIND. and studies baffling and insuperable, pursuits ending only in hopeless, disheartening chaos, and difficulties insurmountable by mankind \u2014 complex and abstruse. Thus were her thoughts engaged when suddenly the chamber trembled as if shaken by an earthquake. Curious cries and noises resounded in the air, and amid a babel of sounds and flashes of lurid light the satyr-like form of the spirit Ilackado appeared in the corner of the room, with fire shooting from his nostrilsT mouth, and ears. After a few seconds the unearthly light died out, the confusion of noises stopped, and the fire ceased to spurt from the demon's head and face. Then the spirit advanced towards the lady, and thus addressed her \u2014 \" Mortal, art thou ready ? Prepare to our cave to come. I await thee.\" The Lady Rosalind arose from her seat, and with the greatest intrepidity answered \u2014 \" I'm ready, lead on ; in thy footsteps I will walk.\" \" No,\" said the fiend, \" let. me clutch thy arm.\" The words had scarcely escaped his lips when he caught her by the arm with iron grasp, led her to the door, down the stairs, along the basement corridors. into the kitchen, and down through the trap-door, by broken stone stairs, into the foetid atmosphere of the wine-cellar."], [115, "WITH THE IMMORTALS. 107 They had now got to the door leading into the subterraneous passage which winds its way towards the hamlet before mentioned ; and, without uttering a single word, the demon pushed open the ponderous door, caught up the Lady Rosalind in his arms and fled with terrific speed through the cavern. And even flying at such a rate, sights of woe and horror tilled her dazzled vision \u2014 hideous spectres met her view on all sides. When about half-way through this subterranean passage the demon stopped his horizontal flight, and seemed to descend with like rapidity. At last he ceased to move, and left the lady, almost breathless with terror and excitement, standing at the entrance to a witch's cave. Their presence without was greeted from within by a phalanx of discordant and sonorous sounds and acclamations. But above all other sounds there could be distinctly heard a cat-like growl which was uttered by a serpent with a human head, which guarded the entrance to the cave, and the guttural tones of the witch demanding to know who was there. \" It is I, Ilackado,\" answered the spirit. \"But I smell mortal blood,\" retorted the witch. \" Who's the mortal ? \" \" One that wants thee to prognosticate ; one, I hope that shall be ours hereafter,\" said Ilackado."], [116, "108 LADY ROSALIND. \" Then welcome ; and enter,\" returned the witch. They entered, and lo ! the demon disappeared, and the Lady Rosalind stood friendless in the witch's \u2022cave ! In the centre was a large caldron seething in human blood, over which the witch was bending, gesticulating wildly, and pronouncing mystic words \u2014 Mumbling of wicked charms; conjuring the moon. A fire smouldered beneath the caldron, and by its fitful glare the weird furniture and ornaments of the cave were distinctly visible. Serpents of enormous size, their fangs glittering in the firelight, crept about the floor ; dead sea-dragons were hung about ; toads, lizards, tortoises, aud other revolting reptiles were suspended from the ceiling ; numerous apes ran towards the lady and fawned upon her; while porcupines and other setous animals and human bones, arranged in grotesque shapes, were fastened to the walls. Volumes of dense smoke arose from the caldron. which, when they reached the ceiling, diffused, and descended to within a few feet of the ground. The witch stirred the noxious liquid with a human leg-bone, causing it to emit a foetid, sulphurous odour ; and now and then, with mystic air, she dropped some strange ingredients into the fire beneath, which"], [117, "WIIH THE IMMORTALS. 109 instantly blazed up, casting a green, sickly glare through the ghastly gloom of the cavern. Through the ascending fumes multitudinous diabolical forms and figures were seen ; and as the hag stalked with wild gait around the caldron in her sibylline circuit the fire-light shone vividly upon her person, bringing out into bold relief every feature of her hideous countenance. She had those red, turned eyes and strangely hooked nose which Theophrastus Paracelsus pronounced to be the prominent characteristics of a witch. Her eyes were likewise fierce, protruding unnaturally from their sockets ; yet they were remarkably intelligent and human-looking in expression. Her hair was fiery red, and fell dishevelled and bristly down below her waist. She had a beard of the same colour, narrow, long and shaggy. Her lank, attenuated arms were uncovered, and being curiously scaly presented the appearance of those of one who was afflicted with a repulsive cutaneous disease. The Lady Rosalind now stood motionless in this mystic presence. The hell-born hag drew herself up to her full height. leaned forward on her crooked staff, and gazing search ino-ly into the countenance of the only human being within that cavern, asked, in shrill, unearthly tones \u2014"], [118, "110 LADY ROSALIND. \u25a0' What wilt thou, lady ? \" \" I pray thee give me fair fortune,\" answered Lady Rosalind, in tremulous tones. \u2022\u2022 I cannot mould the future ; I eau but foresee, antl foreseeing foretell,\" replied the withered witch. \" Start, not, but listen ! Young as thou art, and much sadness as thou hast seen, much more sadness wilt thou see. Unknowingly thou hast caused much grief ; much more grief, and jealousy, too, wilt thou cause \u2014 anguishing souls, on meeting thee, will anguish more. Thou shalt be more beloved than beloving.

One there is that would harm thee \u2014 beware of him ! Beware ! \" she cried, and her words echoed and re-echoed in the distance. Again she threw some particles into the caldron, stalked around it with fantastic gait, and then, point ing with her wand into the black recesses of her dark abode, she exclaimed \u2014 \u2022Behold!\" Lady Rosalind peered into the smoky gloom, and there she saw shadowed forth (oh, hideous adumbra tion !) a room in De Fordyke Hall, in which her own figure was portrayed kneeling, with her hands clasped, and her face upturned in suppliant earnestness."], [119, "111 WITH THE IMMORTALS. Bending over her was the figure of an unknown man, apparently in a violent rage, holding in his uplifted hand a shining blade. He seemed about to move when the scene quickly changed ; and now she beheld one of the most beautiful portions of her own delightful walk, across which was lying the body of a man in a pool of blood. The scene changed again, but its substitute wavered and grew dim in the eyes of Lady Rosalind. She could not see what it was. She heard the witch cry out, \"No more! But, finally, I warn thee beware of him ! After all this is past thou shalt be \u2014 \" The rest was inaudible to Lady Rosalind. A sickly pallor stiff used her countenance, cold drops of perspira tion rolled like beads down her forehead, her brain .swam round ; she heard nor knew nothing more ; she sank into a deep swoon. When she recovered she found herself sitting in her study, as she had been but two hours before, when the spirit Ilackado first appeared to her that night."], [120, "CHAPTER XIV. A RUNAWAY. It is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. During the progress of these events at De Fordyke Hall, things were not running very smoothly at the Rectory. The monotony was once more broken by the appear ance, not of one process-server, but of two ; and this circumstance fully accounts for the much-ruffled state of mind of Mr. Holzapfel. He grew sour and snappish even towards Edith. In truth, he was entangled in an inextricable web, out of which he saw no escape \u2014 he was a fly struggling between two spiders \u2014 Edith and the process-servers \u2014 into whose \" parlours \" he had deliberately walked. If he stopped at the Rectory he would be persecuted by the bailiffs, and if he left he would have to bring Edith with him ; for he plainly saw that she was in love with him, and was determined to accompany him. no matter where he went \u2014 that she would cling to him as the seashore limpet clings to the rock. After consideration (if, indeed, consideration it could"], [121, "113 A RUNAWAY. be called, for he so seldom considered anything!), he determined to leave the Rector}-. He would do his utmost to prevent Edith from going with him, but if the worst came to the worst, he should only suffer her to do so. \" This day week, Edith,\" said Holzapfel, one evening as they sat alone in the simple drawing-room of the Rectory \u2014 \"this day week I will take my departure. Those process-servers have made me almost mad \u2014 you can see that for yourself \u2014 and, besides, if they were not troubling me at all, I am tiring of this rustic life. If I remain much longer, I feel that I shall become fossilized or petrified, or some other such catastrophe will befall me. I'll just take a trip to my cousin in Ireland, see how she's getting on, knock a few fivers out of her, and then return \u2014 by which time those tor menting men would be off somewhere else looking for me, and I would be at rest for another short time, at least.\" \" And won't you take me with you ? \" inquired Edith. \" / would like a little change, too, from this monotony. I would like also to see your cousin.\" Edith did not care about the change, she did not care about Holzapfel's cousin ; but what she did care for was Holzapfel himself, and he quickly saw through all this. \" I can't take you, Edith, but you wouldn't mind my absence for a week or two, would you ? \" i"], [122, "114 lady' Rosalind. \"But \u2014 but \u2014 \" said Edith, hesitatingly, \"you might \u2014 \" \"I might stop longer. What if I did? I will return, sooner or later.\" \" But I would rather go with you, Wilhelm. You know how I love you, and I could not bear a long separation from you. Do take me.\" \"Very well ; and, since you aie so desirous of coming with me, we will consult the Doctor about it to-night.\" These words were uttered by Holzapfel not with a sense of the rectitude of taking such a course, but rather with a view to being disburdened of Edith, for he knew perfectly well that Dr. Holmes would imme-' diately set his face against such a step. He knew also that Edith would rather accompany him secretly than let her uncle know of it at all. \" Could I not go with you, Wilhelin, without letting the Doctor know about it ? He would make such a fuss about it, and so would Gretta.\" \" Oh, I could not think of such a thing ! \" answered Holzapfel, hypocritically. \" To leave the house with me without your guardian's leave ! Monstrous ! If you obtain his sanction I will be perfectly satisfied.\" \"' Then since it must be so,\" said Edith, with a sigh, \"you will ask the Doctor's leave this evening ?\" \" I will, gladly,\" said Holzapfel."], [123, "A RUNAWAY. 115 They had not long to wait, for in a few minutes the door opened and the Doctor entered. \" I have just been telling Edith that I will be leaving the Rectory for a time, in order to pay a visit to my cousin in Ireland, and, indeed, as much as anything else, to avoid those process-servers.\" \u2022' Well,\" said the Doctor, apprehensively. \" I wish, and Edith wishes, that she should come with me.\" \" Do give me permission, uncle ? \" added Edith, almost imploringly. \" Well,\" said Dr. Holmes, addressing Holzapfel, \" you are engaged to my niece. If you wish her to accompany you, marry her ; otherwise I will not allow her from under my observation.\" The Doctor turned haughtily and left the room, and Edith followed him. Holzapfel, who, during their presence, pretended to be completely silenced by the Doctor's words, now broke into a fit of laughter at the success of his little plan for shaking off Edith. His merriment was suddenly checked by the re-entry of Edith and her uncle. \" Mr. Holzapfel,\" said the latter, calmly, \" since you are so anxious that Edith should go with you to Ireland, and that she has now asked me, as a particular favour, to allow her to do so, I will consent, but solely"], [124, "116 LADY ROSALIND. on the condition that I shall accompany you. Other wise she shall not go.\" \" I am perfectly satisfied with that arrangement,\" said Holzapfel, \" and I am sure that my cousin will be delighted to have your company. She is very deep \u2014 ordinary individuals do not suit her. I hear she is very lonely by herself, and I have not the slightest doubt but that she would enjoy your presence, and, above all, your conversation.\" The Doctor bowed his acknowledgment of the com pliment paid. \" Do not think I flatter, Doctor,\" returned Holzapfel. \" J am not one of that sort.\" \" Oh ! no, no, no,\" said Dr. Holmes, smilingly. \" This day week I think you said we would leave for Ireland ? \" \" Yes ; if, of course, that will suit you.\" \"It will. I will arrange matters between this and then. Edith,\" he added, \" I am tired, and am going up to my room. Just bring me up a cup of tea when it is ready.\" \" I will, uncle,\" answered Edith, and the Doctor left the room. \" This is too bad,\" said Edith, as the door closed after him, \" to have uncle coming ; he'll only be a trouble to your cousin, particularly when she is in the frame of mind you say.\" \" Perhaps so,\" rejoined Holzapfel. \" But then, you know, you could not come if he did not.\""], [125, "117 A RUNAWAY'. \" But I could have if you had said nothing to uncle of it. Why could we not have gone without saying a word about it ? \" \" I have said before that that would be a very wrong course to take. I would not take part in such an unseemly deed.\" Edith was inclined to say a great deal more, but she was interrupted by the entree of her sister, who was pale and worn looking. The tea having been served, and Edith having brought a cup to her uncle, the trio supped almost in silence, a silence which Edith was the first to break. \u2022' We will be leaving you this day week, Gretta \u2014 for a while only,\" she said. \" Who ? \" inquired Marguerite, whose ordinary utter ances of late seldom exceeded a monosyllable at a time. \" Uncle, Wilhelm, and myself. We're just going to Ireland for a wdiile,\" answered Edith. Marguerite was silent ; but could Holzapfel have seen her eyes at that moment he would have read volumes. The language of the eye is the language of the soul ! A person of keen sensitiveness may control all other organs that display the feelings \u2014 he may stop all other valves of expression save the eye. Weighed down with sorrow and humiliation he may laugh and dance and appear joyful ; but in such"], [126, "118 LADY ROSALIND. moments look to the eye, the mirror of the soul, and there the truth is revealed\u2014 the breaking heart and the agonizing soul within ! Marguerite was no exception to this rule. Had there been sympathetic souls in the room on this occasion they would have immediately seen that she felt acutely that she was altogether unthought of \u2014 that all were leaving \u2014 leaving her to herself. But Holzapfel and Edith were not sympathetic \u2014 it was their nature, and they could not help it. As soon as the meal was over, Marguerite left the room, as silently as she had entered ; but that night. as they retired to rest, she thought it her duty to counsel her sister on the step she was about to take. and she consequently did so. \"Edith,\" she said, \"you are about to leave this house in a week and accompany Mr. Holzapfel to Ireland. Be mindful what you are doing. I have warned you before, and this is the last time I will do so. I pray you do not go with him. Remember the words of our dear mother ; remember my dream and my warnings. I have a presentiment that nothing good can come of your going with this man. even though you are accompanied by uncle. Good-night.\" she concluded, as she left her sister's room and went to her own. \" Good-night, and think on what I have said.\""], [127, "119 A RUNAWAY. Edith did not answer. She was standing at the dressing-table, looking vacantly at the carpet, and in this position she remained for several minutes after Marguerite had left. She was thinking \u2014 thinking that her sister was right and that she was wrong. The voice of blind love, however, overcame the voice of conscience, and Edith terminated her vagaries by starting from her fixed attitude, exclaiming, \" I love Holzapfel, and will not let him go ! I will hold him at any cost ! \" How she carried out this determination, and with what result, let the future reveal ! 'Twas very early in the morning, three days after the night last in question \u2014 so early that daylight was only beginning to break through the clouds \u2014 when Edith (ever on the watch) was aroused from slumber by a slight noise, as if of someone walking through the house. She got up, donned her garments, opened her door, and listened ; and then she heard the hall-door open and shut quietly. She quickly put on her hat and cloak and hurried down to the door. When she opened it she saw Holzapfel walking at a rapid rate towards the outer gate of the Rectory grounds, carrying in his hand a small black tin box. the only article he had brought with him on the evening of his arrival."], [128, "120 LADY ROSALIND. Without a moment's hesitation she hurried after him, and when she reached him she was almost breath less. On hearing the footsteps behind, Holzapfel turned rapidly round, and seeing who it was that now stood before him, he could not suppress the oath that rushed to his lips. \" Damn it all ! \" he exclaimed, \" she has been watch ing me ! \" \" Oh, Wilhelm ! don't go without me ; don't destroy my happiness. Let me go with you ! \" beseech ed Edith. Holzapfel bit his lips impatiently. He had been long watching his opportunity to make his escape from the Rectory ; he had spent many an hour devising plans for so doing, and now, when he had all but carried out his plan, he was watched and stopped \u2014 stopped by her from wdiose meshes he tried hard to escape. He was frenzied with rage, but he succeeded in controlling his passion, seeing that calmness was best. \" Edith,\" he said, hoarsely, \" what would your uncle say if you came away with me in this way ? \" \" I don't care about my uncle. What is his opinion compared with my happiness ? Why should you pre vent me from going ? Don't you know I love you ? I will be for ever miserable if you leave me here alone.\""], [129, "121 A RUNAWAY. Holzapfel, seeing no alternative but to consent to her request, said \u2014 \"As you are determined to accompany me, we had better not delay here ; we may shortly be missed, and then pursued.\" \" Come on, then,\" retorted Edith; hastily. They opened the garden wicket, and passed out, and as they did so, Edith looked sorrowfully back at the Rectory. It was a farewell look ; she knew not for how long she should be absent. She passed out of that gate, and in doing so she passed from a quiet country home into the harsh, pitiless world \u2014 this world of perpetual trouble \u2014for how long she knew not. Let us for the present draw a curtain over the im mediate future of the runaways, and return to the Rectory. The Doctor was slightly disturbed bj' the banging of \u25a0the doors, but thinking that it was merely the whist ling of the winds, or some other such trifle, he paid no further attention, and was soon again in a sound sleep. It was not until morning that he dis covered what had really happened. He then came to the conclusion that Holzapfel and Edith had concocted the plan of running away to gether ; but in this he was wrong, for Holzapfel, as the reader is already aware, was doing his best to get away without Edith, whilst she forced herself upon him."], [130, "122 LADY ROSALIND. The Doctor, without much preparation, bade Mar guerite farewell, and left the Rectory with a view to following Holzapfel and Edith. He set out for the residence of Wilhelm's cousin \u2014 De Fordyke Hall \u2014 whence he felt sure they had journeyed. By means of numerous stage coaches, and other dingy vehicles, he at length arrived at London, whence he proceeded by vessel to Ireland, and arrived at mid day at his destination. He inquired for the Lady Rosalind De Fordyke, at the same time sending up his card by Jean Tuppitt. While he waited in the hall, he began to fear that the runaways had not come there ; but his fears were soon set at rest, for Edith, who had been in an adjoining room, on hearing his voice, rushed out in her usual gushing way to meet him. Without waiting for a word of reprimand, she showed him into the front parlour, where Holzapfel was sitting in a quite unconcerned manner, smoking a cigarette. \" Good morning. Doctor,\" he said, coolly extending his hand. \" I suspected I should find you here, sir,\" answered the Doctor, rejecting the proffered hand. \" I demand an explanation of jour conduct,\" he added, rather excitedly. \"Well, sir,\" said Holzapfel, \"I did not take awav your niece. I was, in fact, coming by myself, when"], [131, "123 A RUNAWAY\". she insisted on leaving the Rectory along with me,\" and then he went on to explain the wdiole facts of tin ease \u2014 at least, what he said were the facts. He, however, omitted to tell that what he wanted to do was to jilt Edith altogether. The Doctor was soon pacified, and he had just finished remonstrating with Edith when Lady Rosalind entered the room. Holzapfel introduced the Doctor to her ladyship, whereupon the former apologized almost obsequiously for the trouble and upset which his niece was the cause of. \"No need to apologize whatever,\" said her ladyship ; '\" instead of annoyance they have caused me pleasure. for I have been very lonely of late, and they have cheered me up somewhat. I hope that you and they will stop for some time to come. I am so lonely when by myself.\" \" If it please you we will stay for a short time.\" answered Dr. Holmes. \"I am glad to hear you say so,\" returned Lady Rosalind. \" I have not seen many of my friends, even the most intimate, of late. I feel so sad and down cast ; but I rather like my cousin's and your niece's company, and I am sure I will enjoy yours.\" They did stop, as will be seen, for some time at the Hall \u2014 mayhap too long !"], [132, "CHAPTER XV. LEAGUES BENEATH THE SEA. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Jacques Rembrandt had hardly thrust Claude beneath the surging billows of the ocean when a huge sea monster, half man, half fish, seized him and dragged him at an impetuous speed downwards through the quiet, untumultuous bosom of the waters ! From that moment he lost all consciousness. Sense consciousness did not return, but spirit con sciousness did, and then Claude found that the monster had actually feasted upon his body, and that his soul \u2014 invulnerable \u2014 had become part and parcel, had become the mastering spirit, though not an indispensable part, of the monster that it now inhabited. In short, his body had become incorporated with that of the animal, and his soul resided within the animal as it had formerly resided in his own now inexistent body. All that was left him of his former state was his human soul, or seat of memory and reason, together with his spiritual soul or divine essence."], [133, "125 LEAGUES BENEATH THE SEA. He also had hearing and eyesight, not his own sight. but that of the monster, by which he could see. At first sensations of awe and horror crept over his soul ; tumult thrilled him through. These feelings, however, soon subsided, and as he came by degrees to more fully realize his situation, he found that he had complete mastery and command over the body in which his spirit was imprisoned. He now sped as fast as arms and fins could propel him through the watery waste, now upwards, now downwards, and now horizontally, in the hope of find ing- some living thing, some companion in that aqueous wilderness. Finally he descended lower into the recesses of the ocean, where, after seeing many pisciform denizens of the \"vasty deep,\" he encountered another form similai in every way to his own \u2014 a human head and bust, with fish-like, scale-covered extremity. It seemed glad at finding him ; an expression of human gladness played about its face. \u2022 Claude \u2014 or rather Claude's spirit \u2014 through the monster, acknow ledged the salutations of this other being, upon which it beckoned him to follow it. At the same time it turned round, continued to beckon, and moved at first slowly, and then by degrees more rapidly, downwards. Claude inferred from such display of intelligence on the part of this creature that it must have been"], [134, "126 LADY ROSALIND. possessed of another human spirit like his own \u2014 ill-fated, unhappy. He hesitated for a few moments. and then followed. Downwards through the abysmal waters they hurried, until at last, far beneath them, dwindling away almost to nothingness in the dizziness of dis tance, there were visible innumerable glittering, jewel covered peaks and cliffs, the dazzling brightness of which threw a silvery tinge up amid the dense green ness of the great waste. When they at length reached the bottom, Claude was greeted with g-racious smiles by hundreds of similar creatures. They all made way for him and his conductor. The latter led him through innumer able rocky and diamond-clad mazes, sapphire-covered cavities, and dark caverns, where many of these strange figures posed or gently moved about with grace and ease. Still the first seen figure led the way, and on turn ing round Claude was amazed, if, indeed, he could be further so than he already was, to find that, as thev passed, all the other figures came forth from their resting-places, and followed in their trail. And now they reached a pearly arch of dazzling brightness. On passing through this arch Claude found himself within a mighty rock-roofed edifice, the whole interior of which was bedecked with pre cious stones and brilliants of every size and hue."], [135, "127 LEAGUES BENEATH THE SEA. Towering up in its centre were peaky rocks, on which stood fairy-like lamps that emitted luminous blue flames, which (notwithstanding that they were sur rounded by water) stretched upwards to the roof and shed lustre through that nameless abode. Here also were more of these half-human creatures sailing up and down, backwards and forwards, one of whom attended at each of the lamps, constantly feeding them with some unknown ingredient, thus perpetually keeping the edifice illumined with a bine glare. Presently the most beautiful musical strains were heard, and ambrosial odours floated about, whilst far away in a parallel view was seen a long, narrow passage (from whence the music and odours issued), from the end of which a fountain of transcendental light flowed with unfailing regularity. Claude, his guide, and followers entered this passage, and as they proceeded through it the music grew louder and still sweeter, and the perfumes still more diverse und delicious. Claude soon discovered that the place from whence the flood of vivid light proceeded was no other than the Vale of Coral, the residence of the queen of these mysterious citizens of the deep. Here, in the strifeless depths of the blue waters, this sea-queen, fair and beautiful, reclined upon a coral, shell-wheeled chariot, covered with fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, antl drawn by many nymphs, by flower-formed traces,"], [136, "128 LADY ROSALIND. from place to place. Other nymphs hovered round and over their queen, ministering incense from golden censers or strewing sweet-scenting flowers in her way. Circle after circle of beauteous mermaids floated about and around, some decking their green hair with shells, others playing- on lute and harp-like instruments, while others uttered the sweetest melodies that ear could listen to \u2014 melodies weird and inhuman. Amid general displays of rejoicing Claude was ushered into the presence of the queen. She. in some mystic sign-language, bade him welcome, and, strange though it may appear, Claude knew, instinctively, as it were, what each sign meant. The queen now motioned him away, and, looking about, he found that his former guide was not any where near him ; but another figure beckoned him to follow it. He did so, and as they proceeded back through the labyrinthic course by which Claude had entered, his new conductor conversed freely with him in sign-language. He gave Claude a history of his life before he \u2014 or rather his spirit \u2014 was sent to inhabit his present form, and he expressed the wish that he had been deprived of memory, which was the only trouble that he and his associates had, for after the newness of their life wore away they became possessed of an insatiable longing to see and know about the persons they had left behind them in the regions of earth."], [137, "LEAGUES BENEATH TH K SEA. 129 Claude, in return, narrated his life ; and it was not until that moment that he became awake to the reality and awf ulness of his position. And then his whole past pressed with crushing weight upon his soul. He thought of his young life and of the deed \u2014 the forgery \u2014 which banished him from his native land and blighted his youthful prospects ; he thought of his five j-ears' miserable existence in the African diamond fields, of his fortune, aud of his escape thence ; he thought of the treachery of Rembrandt, his companion ; of his own reckless plunge into the waters and of Jacques' pretended attempt to rescue him ; he thought of the rougii manner in which his companion dashed him from his g-rasp, having- first secured the belt of diamonds ; and, lastlj\", he thought (alas! that memory, that pre cious gift to men. should thus become a curse) of his wife, and of the deed which he had handed over to Rembrandt. Would Rembrandt make use of that deed ? He shuddered at the torturing thought. \"We try to drown thought and to amuse ourselves here,\" gesticulated Claude's conductor, as they pro ceeded further now upwards. \" Our principal pastime and thought-killer consists in following and hunting that ' little scaled inhabitant of water and air,' which is known as the flying-fish.

Sometimes we pursue it to the ships which pass by, on the boards of which it lets itself fall in order to escape us; but, there, 1 have no doubt, it meets with as bad a fate as it would by allowing us to catch it. It is a case of ' out of the frying-pan into the fire ' with it.

Brood not too much on the destiny of man. Days passed, and each day and hour marked an advance in friendship between Lady Rosalind and Dr. Holmes. The former found in the Doctor if not a kindred spirit, at least one who was sympathetic, one who would enter, and who was competent to enter, into the many \u2022arguments and theories of which she had read and studied so much, and of which she longed to talk, more particularly those concerning man in his relations, here and hereafter, with God. She was just as restless and unsatisfied as ever. She had been longing for dealings with the other world ; and even now, after her experiences in that direction, her soul was as insatiable, thirsted as much after the things of mystery as ever. But now she wished that she had not seen so much into the future ; it had made her more miserable still, and she had no wish for a repetition of such scenes as that of the cave and the witch. She seemed glad of the Doctor's company ; his conversations were so soothing-"], [140, "132 LADY ROSALIND. and sympathetic, and oftentimes when Edith and Holzapfel were out walking or driving, sitting in the old tea-house at the end of one of the groves, or perhaps conversing or playing games in the drawing-room, her ladyship and the Doctor might be seen walking leisurely through the garden grounds talking earnestly. It was a fine autumn evening; the trees were almost bare, and leaves everywhere strewed the ground ; the sun had hidden his serene face behind the distant sombre mountains, while large white clouds floated overhead. Lady Rosalind and the Doctor were walking slowly through a long grove near the Hall, and they were con versing, or rather arguing, on future probation and punishment. The Doctor, ever since he had learned her ladyship's views, had been trying to turn her mind from paths almost atheistic into the peaceable walks of religion. \"How can you tell me,\" broke in Lady Rosalind. \" that because Eve \u2014 one single woman, the progenitress of the human race \u2014 plucked and ate fruit from a for bidden tree, because she committed that one single act of disobedience, that the whole of her posterity were and are consequently stained with that sin ? And mankind, on this account, being created with evil passions, and with an overpowering inclination to bad ness and wickedness more than to good, how can you"], [141, "133 REMONSTRATION. tell me that if we don't restrain and keep in check those wicked, inborn inclinations, we shall be visited with an eternity of punishment in regions of tire and darkness ! I don't believe it. It is impossible. God would not be God if such were the case.\" \" I cannot agree with your ideas generally.\" said Dr. Holmes ; \" my humble opinion is that our concep tion of God is exactly like our conception of eternity. We can conceive no limit, no bounds to eternity, sf we attempt to fix a limit to it, the next point that forces itself upon us is. where is the limit \u2014 where is the boundary of that imagined limit ? Thus we would go on thinking and thinking, until all further con templation was stopped by the loss of sanity \u2014 we would, in all probability, end in the lunatic asylum. Looking at the other side of the matter we find that, owing to the restrictions and limitations of the human mind \u2014 owing to the very small tether which is allowed mankind \u2014 we cannot conceive of eternity without an end, for we can only measure eternity by time, which is terminable. We can measure the latter \u2014 we cannot measure the former \u2014 it is beyond the grasp of the human brain to do so.

We have a sufficiency of sense conscious realities to prove the existence of God. and to give us an undefinable idea of Him ; but, regarding the beginning of God as in the case of eternity, our inability to penetrate into the mysterious kingdom of infinity prevents us from obtaining a full knowledge of Him and the nature of His existence. \" They are truly blessed who are possessed of a simple, unquestioning faith, and it was trying to inquire into things which are altogether beyond the mind of man to grasp and understand that has caused many a one to lose his faith \u2014 many a one to look upon religion as the plague of the human race ; aye, and many a one to lose his soul ! \" \" Yes, yes ! you may be right ! \" said Lady Rosalind, in an absent-minded manner. \" You may be right. Both were silent, the Doctor giving time for his words to work the desired effect. \" Many a one to lose his soul ! \" she repeated, after slight reflection, half to herself, half aloud, and then she continued : \" No, Dr. Holmes, no one will ever lose his soul. There is no such place as hell. If there were such a place as hell God would not be just. God placed man on this earth, giving him on every side the means of committing crime most hideous, and a will more prone to evil than to good. This being the ease."], [143, "135 REMONSTRATION. no matter how bad a man may have been on this earth \u2014 no matter if he committed every conceivable wrong \u2014 would God be a God of Justice, much less a God of mercy, if a hell existed to receive the tempted and the sinful ? When God brings a man into the world \u2014 at that moment and for ages before \u2014 He knows what that man's end is to be ; and, in the face of that fact, is it not absurd to say that there is a hell, which is tanta mount to . saying that God created man to damn him ? \" \" God never created man to damn him,\" returned the Doctor ; \" but He gave him free will to save or damn himself, and this is what we are all taught to believe, unless we discredit the Word of God Himself. \" Shun these sophistries ; they are put forward by so-called philosophers, they are dangerous, andean lead to no good end. I have long- since learned that the theories of philosophers of this school are as vapoury and impracticable as those of other schools. For instance, we are told by a certain scientist, in all seriousness, that the bulk of gold composing four sovereigns could be beaten out and stretched into a wire long enough to girdle the earth ! And this is set down as an incontrovertible fact, just because gold has been found to be a very malleable metal, for computa tion in this matter is altogether out of the question. My only wonder is that this same philosopher did not"], [144, "136 LADY ROSALIND. say, forsooth, that it would be possible to put the said 'girdle round about the earth in forty minutes ! ' \"Then, again (taking another point), we are told, regarding the colours of the spectrum \u2014 the undulatory theory teaches it \u2014 that it altogether depends upon and is due to the number of vibrations performed by the molecules of ether, that different parts of the spectrum produce different colours. So far, so good ; so far I believe. Then we are informed that the number of these vibrations is very great, differs with each colour, and increases from red to violet. \"Very well. But the scientist does not stop here; he goes from the possible into the impossible and ridi culous when he says that it has been calculated that the number of vibrations for intense red is 458 millions of millions in a second, and for violet 727 millions of millions. Science may do, and no doubt has done, a great deal, but these figures are the mere fabrics of the imagination. When scientists find ont a little, they make that little the corner-stone of a shadowy mansion of imagination \u2014 merely notional and air-built \u2014 which falls to nothingness when touched by the slightest breath from the cave of Eolus. The two instances which I have adduced prove that such is the fact. \" So much for those theories ; and it seems to me that the ideas and theories which you have regarding"], [145, "137 REMONSTRATION. man and his relations with his Creator are quite as flimsy : nay, more, I think it is the deepest insult offered to our God, who made us, to, as we may say, give the Bible (which states that even the angels don't know His intentions) the lie, and say in our own minds, ' We won't be made fools of any longer, or be kept in the dark : our clear heads will soon discover that all the revelations, as they are called, of Holy Writ are blinds,\" and thus we, creatures of clay, with swelling brain and throbbing heart, attempt to make ourselves as wise as God Himself. Pursue, I say, this reasoning of facts as we see them, and it will not be long before you conclude that there is no God, no heaven, no hell, no soul to live again ! \" I implore of you, Lady Rosalind, if you value your happiness, your peace of mind, to give up this futile attempt to trace the future on the lines of man. Leave what is to be and live for God and Him aloue. Trust all to Him, now and for eternity ; leave the future to One who began so beautiful and wonderful a work, and, believe me, He knows how to finish it as beautifully as He began it. \" Pardon me, Lady Rosalind, for my over-ardour, but I do feel strongly on these matters.

The truth of the Doctor's words, combined with their earnestness, struck home to her heart's core, and from that moment she resolved to abandon those inquiries and searching^ after things, to man, inscrutable, those \" futile attempts,\" as the Doctor rightly termed them, to become as wise as the God who created us. \" I will promise you, Doctor, to give up, for ever, those baffling, insuperable pursuits, and from now and for ever to trust in the God who rules the destinies of man, for the life here and hereafter.\" So saying, she entered the Hall. The Doctor fol lowed, and they both felt happier than they had been for many a year before. When they reached the sitting-room, Lady Rosalind was a little surprised to find Colonel De Burg con versing there with Holzapfel and Edith. The Colonel immediately stood up and bowed reverentially to her ladyship, saying \u2014 \" So you see I have come to the Hall again, Lady Rosalind. I have been talking with your cousin and with Miss Holmes.\""], [147, "139 REBI0NSTRATI0N. \" You are welcome. Colonel De Burg,\" she returned, somewhat coldly. \" I suppose,\" put in Holzapfel, humorously, \" it is a case of the mountain coming to Mahommed.\" Seeing that the Colonel was a little embarrassed. Lady Rosalind immediately dropped the subject, and introduced him to Dr. Holmes. They all took seats and chatted away for a considerable time, but nothing passed between them worthy of note, save that the Colonel was altogether captivated by the charming manner of Holzapfel, and Holzapfel, for his part, took an immediate fancy to the Colonel, and when the time arrived for him to depart for the evening, Holzapfel accompanied him through \"Lady Rosalind's walk\" and partly on his homeward journey through the fields. On parting they shook hands warmly, and Holzapfel expressed a wish that the Colonel would soon again visit the Hall. Both, indeed, went their ways with pleasurable anticipations of subsequent meetings. If frequent meetings afforded them pleasure, they must, indeed, have been gratified, for, from that day forth, the Colonel went to the Hall almost every second evening, and Holzapfel. on each occasion, saw him at least as far as the end of the g-rove. \" They're inseparable \u2014 inseparable.\" murmured old Jean Tuppitt to himself one evening, as he watched"], [148, "140 LADY ROSALIND. them leaving the Hall. \" They're always talking so earnestly, and arguing so warmly sometimes, too. 1 wonder what it's all about. I'll try.\" So thinking, the gardener crept along the outside of the shadowed walk until he got within hearing distance of the two gentlemen. He listened atten tively, thinking that he would hear something extraordinary \u2014 some secret worth knowing ; but in this he was disappointed, for the sum and total of what he found out was merely that the Colonel promised to use his interest to procure a military appointment for Holzapfel."], [149, "CHAPTER XVII BARTHO 1,0)1 [\u2022; W VYSE I am not what I am. Holzapfel did not now wish or even think so much about being back in London as of old. He did not now long after the billiard-room, the club, the drinking saloon, or the music-hall. At De Fordyke Hall it was more lively than at the Rectory; and with such com- pany as that of his cousin, Lady Rosalind, Colonel De Burg, and occasionally the talkative old gardener (not forgetting Edith) the time did not hang heavily. Now he hardly thought of London ; he hungered not after the flesh-pots of Egypt. He had almost forgotten Miss So-and-so (whom he met at such a person's ball). who had teeth like pearl, which she managed to display on every possible occasion, but which Holzapfel acci- dentally found out were purchased at a dentist's for five guineas ! He quite forgot the existence of My Lady So-and-so. whose bright, black sparkling eyes she took good care to squeeze up, and suddenly open wide when conversing with anyone, so that her inter- locutor might admire them all the more ! But he"], [150, "142 LADY ROSALIND. (busy body !) was not long in ascertaining that the peculiar sparkle of the said lady's eyes was due to the use of belladonna ! Of Miss (another lady friend of his), too, he was oblivious. In short, all seemed to be forgotten for the time; and Holzapfel seemed perfectly content. Ever since the evening on which he had met Colonel De Burg he liked him more and more each time he saw him ; and, indeed, the feeling of friendship was mutual. Their tastes were similar in many ways, and their conversations, on that account, were most suitable to one another. They talked over many subjects, and were never so happy as when relating military remi niscences. They soon became almost inseparable, and every time that the Colonel visited the Hall the first tiling he did was to look out for Holzapfel. This may, indeed, have been policy on his part ; for his main object in coming there, truth to tell, was to see Lady Rosalind, and to try and win her for his wife ; and no observer of humanity could fail to see through this. Holzapfel was not without noticing that such was the case; and one evening, as the- Colonel on leaving the HaU, was talking to him as they walked through the grove, and bewailing the fact that he did not know how soon he would receive orders to leave his present quarters, the former said abruptly \u2014 \" Why, what should you care about leaving this"], [151, "BARTHOLOMEW VYSE. 143 place ? Goodness knows you should be glad to get away from such a lonely, solitary neighbourhood.\" \" Yes, yes,\" mused the Colonel, \" it is a little lonely, 1 must confess that ; but then you know I am an admirer of the beauties of nature, and this is such a beautiful place ; and \u2014 \" \"And,\" broke in Holzapfel, \"\"there are other attrac tions, and one great attraction. I know yon will excuse me for what must seem impertinence, but which in reality is not ; but 1 can tell you in a minute why you would rather stay here ! Has not Lady Rosalind got something to do with it ? Are you not madly in love with her ? If you are not I will henceforth brand myself as no reader of the human character, or of human expression.\" \" I am, Holzapfel,\" said the Colonel, and then he narrated the whole story of his love for Lady Rosalind, of his proposal and her refusal, and of his still lively hopes of winning her for his own. \"1 tell all this to you as a friend,\" said the Colonel, \"and 1 will ask you as a favour not to speak of it to anyone.\" \"' 1 will not, old man,\" said Holzapfel, good-naturedly. They were at the end of the shady grove, and were about to part for the evening. \" Holzapfel,\" whispered the Colonel, \"' I may as well tell you all. I intend again proposing for Lady Rosa lind in a short time. If she refuses me 1 will never"], [152, "144 LADY ROSALIND. after be seen at the Hall. My life will be blighted ; I shall be for ever miserable ; 1 shall go out on the world a wrecked man ! \" These words were spoken with an awful earnestness aud they reached Holzapfel's heart's core. The Colonel looked keenly into Wilhelm's face, then shook his hand warmly, and departed. \" Good-hearted fellow that,\" thought Holzapfel, as he walked briskly towards the Hall ; \" I knew all along what was wrong with him. I wonder why she won't marry him. He's about as good a match as she could get. But it's just like Rosalind ; she always was a strange creature, from all reports. Only that I have promised secrecy I would speak to her about it. Well, well, no matter.\" Holzapfel then turned his thoughts into other channels; and presently, on reaching the Hall, he was met by Edith, who reprimanded him somewhat severeh' for going to walk so frequently with the Colonel, and leaving her by herself. Holzapfel did not say much, but he thought to himself that he already had too much of her ; at least, more than he cared for. He did not mind much, however, so lono- as the wedding-day was kept at a considerable distance ! At almost eleven o'clock on the same night, as all the then occupants of the Hall were thinking of retirino for the night, heavy footfalls were heard without,"], [153, "145 BARTHOLOMEW VYSE. followed immediately by loud knocking at the great front door. The knocking was answered by one of the men-servants, who presently entered the sitting-room, and announced that a gentleman, who happened to be travelling by a mail-coach, which had broken down on the roadside some three miles away, sought shelter for a time \u2014 or at least for the night \u2014 until he got some means of proceeding on his journey. The servant handed the stranger's card to the Lady Rosalind, on which the name \" Bartholomew Vyse \" was printed in small unembellished letters. She looked at it for a moment, and then asked Holzapfel to go and see what the person was like. When Hol zapfel reached the hall he saw a small, middle-aged, keen-eyed man, with black hair, wearing a great top coat, and carrying in his hand a portmanteau of con siderable size. The stranger advanced, and in a somewhat aristo cratic tone, said \u2014 '\" I hope you will excuse my disturbing you at such au hour as this, but I was travelling by the stage-coach to Queenstown when the conveyance broke down, and the passengers were obliged to make their way as best thev could to shelter for the night. I had just travelled some three miles when I saw lights issuing from the windows of a distant building, which turns out to be this house.\" L"], [154, "146 LADY ROSALIND. \"You are wet, too,\" said Holzapfel. \" Yes ; it has been raining hea.vily outside. I am wet and tired, and \u2014 \" Lady Rosalind now came into the hall, and as she did so Holzapfel said to the stranger \u2014 \"This is the lady of the house \u2014 the Lady Rosalind De Fordyke.\" The new-comer bowed graciously, and gazing stead fastly into her ladyship's countenance, he repeated what he had already told Holzapfel. \" You will be welcome to stop at the Hall, Mr. Vyse, until you find it convenient to proceed on your journey,\" said Lady Rosalind, in a manner altogether charac teristic of the hospitality of her noble family. Mr. Vyse bowed again, and smiled rather sardoni cally. \" Take off your top coat and hat, Mr. Vyse,\" added her ladyship ; \" and you, Jean,\" speaking to the old gardener, \" take the gentleman's portmanteau to the visitor's room, and see that the apartment is put into order at once.\" The servant obeyed orders, and Mr. Vyse, having divested himself of his great coat and hat, followed Lady Rosalind into the sitting-room. Supper was ordered immediately, and during its course Mr. Vyse made himself very agreeable. He had come on a tour, he said, from America ; hail been"], [155, "147 BARTHOLOMEW VYSE. ill France, England, and parts of Ireland ; aud when the accident occurred he was on his way back to New York. He exhibited all the vivacity and loquacity of the Yankee, telling many interesting and amusing anec dotes. Indeed, ere withdrawing to rest he had made a very favourable impression on the minds of his auditors. Next day Lady Rosalind showed the stranger over the Hall, through all the tapestried apartments. Even the mystic study was not left out. She brought him, too, to see the damp, chill vaults beneath, and the secret passages through the thick walls, of which she told him manj' traditional horrors, at which he seemed surprised. Lastly, they came to the library \u2014 perhaps the most interesting part of the dwelling. Many an ancient book stood on edge in the oaken cases which at intervals lined the walls. The library \u2014 more hall than room \u2014 was also a family portrait and picture gallery, the spaces not taken up with book-cases being completely covered with many ancient oil-paintings, principally battle pieces and portraits. Mr. Vyse went admiringly from picture to picture, Lady Rosalind relating the history of each, and, in the case of portraits, the history of the individual repre sented. The paintings were choice and valuable \u2014"], [156, "148 LADY ROSALIND. battle pieces by Molyn and Cortese ; and many portraits by Holbein. Rembrandt, and Leonardo da Vinci, and others of less note. Now they stood before a full-figure picture of Major De Fordyke \u2014 Lady Rosalind's father. \" This is an excellent portrait of my poor father,\" said her ladyship, sorrowfully. At this Mr. Vyse turned his head to one side, away from Lady Rosalind, and almost growled the words : \" 'Tis he ! 'tis he ! \" His remark, however, was unheard by her ladyship. He instantly looked up at the picture, and at the same time asked \u2014 \" Is he long dead ? ' \" Nearly two years and a half. Mj- dear mother, too, is dead these three years ; so that I am alone now.\" \" Ah ! me,\" exclaimed Mr. Vyse. \" it's a world of soitows, and we all have our share. Do not linger here, it only stirs up sad memories ; and 'tis best, T find, to let them sleep.\" \" 'Tis even so,\" added Lady Rosalind, and as they left the library Mr. Vyse cast another\u2014 a malicious glance at the stately form on the canvas."], [157, "CHAPTER XVIII. A CRIME ! BUT THE CRIMINAL ? Oh, horrible ! most horrible) Days passed by and Bartholomew Vyse said nothing about resuming his journey. He was made very com fortable at the Hall \u2014 treated as an intimate friend would have been ; and perhaps this may have had something to do with the prolongation of his sojourn. He kept as much as possible in the company of Lady Rosalind, and shunned the rest, more particularly Colonel De Burg, whom he avoided assiduously. He saw that Colonel De Burg was strongly attached to Lady Rosalind, but he was somewhat puzzled to know whether she reciprocated those feel ings ; he could not fathom her, although he tried hard to do so. Mr. Vyse was not without seeing the strong friend ship which existed between Holzapfel and the Colonel; nor was he long without knowing all about Dr. Holmes and his niece. In short, he had already found out the entire circumstances and connections of each one whom he had met there."], [158, "150 LADY ROSALIND. He was particularly friendly with Dr. Holmes when he first arrived at the Hall, but he soon changed. He seemed well disposed towards the Colonel, too, at the beginning, but soon (without any apparently assignable reason) he seemed to dislike him. Not, indeed, that he showed it in his manner towards the Colonel, for he was most courteous ; but there was a something in the way he looked at him which a very keen observer might set down to secret dislike. He, however, was not the only one who seemed not exactly to like the Colonel ; Dr. Holmes was not over in love with him either. Although naturally light-hearted and gay, the Colonel was very distant, and at the Hall Holzapfel was the only one, at least so far as appearances went, who thought much of him. Perhaps Holzapfel had number one solely iu view in this respect, for he knew that the Colonel had great interest in the army. Howbeit, such was the case. Things went on in a very uncertain way at the Hall. and Lady Rosalind was in anything but an easy state of mind. She felt upset. How long was her cousin going to stay, and Dr. Holmes and Edith ? When would Mr. Vyse leave, and the Colonel ? She did not like his coming there so often, for she knew well what it all meant. Well, although these things made her feel very nervous, they"], [159, "A CRIME ! BUT THE CRIMINAL 9 151 had the effect of occupying her mind and excluding therefrom g-loomy thoughts and sad memories ; and, moreover, they kept her from communication with the spirits of the other world, and this perhaps in itself was a desideratum. It was a bright evening \u2014 bright in comparison with the gloom of Colonel De Burg's heart. Oh ! he was sad and sick of soul ! He had had a private interview with Lady Rosalind, and had asked her again to become his wife : but, alas ! her answer was only a repetition of the one she had given him on the evening that he first proposed to her. He had on this day received orders to be in readiness in a week's time to go with his regiment abroad, and although, after this second refusal, he had very little hope of winning Lady Rosalind for his own, he told her that he would come again on the day before his departure, bj' which time he hoped she would alter her mind. Holzapfel was the only other soul at the Hall who knew of this second proposal. The Colonel had told him all about it beforehand, and the moment he saw the Colonel's face after the interview with Lady Rosalind on the evening in question, he knew that she had again refused. It was almost dark when Colonel De Burg was leaving the Hall on this occasion ; he was later than"], [160, "152 LADY ROSALIND. usual, and the hour being so advanced he asked Holzapfel not to trouble accompanying him. Holzapfel, however, insisted on doing so and they consequently left the Hall together. Holzapfel was away longer than his wont, and Edith was standing out under the portico watching anxiously for his return, when suddenly she saw him rushing to wards the Hall in a state of fearful excitement. He took no notice of her, but dashed by and into the Hall. As he passed she saw that his hands were covered with blood, and now he was standing at the bottom of the great wide staircase in the hall gasping wildly and crying out in broken accents \u2014 \" Murder ! . The Colonel ! the Colonel is lying dead on her ladyship's walk ! \" In a few moments each one in the Hall stood beside Holzapfel inquiring what he meant. Lady Rosalind came downstairs, followed im mediately by Mr. Vyse ; Dr. Holmes came from the sitting-room ; Edith from the front of the house ; and the servants came running from various places.* \"\" The Colonel is dead ! \" gasped Holzapfel, holding up his bloody hands distractedly. And then he narrated in an incoherent manner that he had only gone part of the \" walk \" with the Colonel. He then turned back, but before reaching the Hall he felt an impulse to go down the grove again."], [161, "A CRIME! BUT THE CRIMINAL ? 153 He was just at the end, and was about to return when he stumbled against something on the ground. Stooping down he felt a bodj* lying at his feet, which ou examination proved to be the lifeless form of Colonel De Burg. All were stunned at this hideous narration. Lady Rosalind, pale as death, at that instant re membered that this was one of the scenes which she had witnessed at the witch's cave \u2014 prophetic vision ! She was very excited, and wanted to go herself to see what had happened, but Dr. Holmes insisted that she and Edith should go with him into the sitting-room. and let Mr. Vyse, Holzapfel, and the servants look after the Colonel. This was done, and the Doctor did his utmost to calm the two ladies, while the others proceeded to the grove, having first provided themselves with firearms. Mr. Vyse went first, and was followed by Jean Tuppitt and two other male-servants. Holzapfel, now a little cooler than he had been, waited to despatch a servant on horseback to the town of K \u2014 for a doctor, and then went to the grove. All assisted in carrying the dead Colonel to the Hall, where he was laid upon a couch in one of the many spare rooms on the ground floor. Soon after, the doctor, by name William James, arrived. On examining the body the doctor found two"], [162, "154 LADY ROSALIND. deep wounds in the throat, caused, he thought, by forcible blows from a sharp one-edged knife \u2014 probably a penknife. One of these wounds had severed the windpipe, and from what the doctor could ascertain life had left the body two hours previously. There were no other marks of violence to be found. While the doctor was examining the body, two officers of the law, who had been sent for, arrived at the Hall. They at once saw Dr. James, and told him not to leave for a little time. He consented, and they went and viewed the dead body, the doctor pointing out the wounds. The constables then interviewed each one staying at the Hall, questioning- them as regarded their where abouts for the last three hours, and all seemed to acquit themselves satisfactorily save Holzapfel. Lady Rosalind had been up in her study, Mr. Vvse had been in his room, Dr. Holmes had been reading in the sitting-room, while Edith had been at first in the library and then in front of the house sitting under the portico. The servants likewise satisfied the detectives as to where they were and what they were doing. But as for Holzapfel a mighty spectre of circumstantial evidence seemed to start up and point its finger at him, marking him out as the perpetrator of the deed. He had gone out with the Colonel, and was his a likely story that having parted with the deceased at the end"], [163, "A CRIME ! \u2014 BUT THE CRIMINAL ? 155 of the. glove he should walk half way back to the Hall and then return ? It was hardly probable. Then, again, his hands were covered with blood. The next move of the law officers was to examine the scene of the murder, which they did with the aid of lanterns. Having done this, and searched the surrounding groves and hedges, they were about to go back to the Hall, when one of their lanterns accidentally flashed on something bright in the grass. Bending down they discovered that the object which had attracted their attention was a large pen-knife, half closed, and on the blade and dudgeon were gouts of blood. The constables, standing in the grass, threw the light of their lamps upon the knife and examined it carefully. At first they saw nothing of note, but one of them having rubbed the clotted blood from the handle found the name \" Wilhelm Holzapfel \" engraved on a small plate thereon. What clearer proof of his guilt could there be than this ? They returned to the Hall, but said nothing of the knife. They were not long back when their chief officer arrived, accompanied by another constable. The four then went to the chamber where the Colonel lay. The first two men explained the whole circumstances"], [164, "156 LADY ROSALIND. to their chief, whereupon he gave orders tp have Holzapfel placed under arrest and immediately brought to the town of K \u2014 .

He was manacled, and in custody of two of the officers was driven away."], [165, "CHAPTER XIX. DOOMED. The laws are wondrous strange. The chief constable and the man who came with him stayed at the Hall, at the request of Dr. Holmes and Mr. Vyse, who stated, even protested, that they did not believe that Holzapfel murdered the Colonel, and they wished to have some protection in the place. \"Who can tell that the criminal is not even at this moment concealed in the house \u2014 perhaps in some of those dark passages ? \" said Mr. Vyse. Although the constables were satisfied that Holzapfel was the guilty one, they searched in every place that thev thought there might be any probability of anyone concealing himself, just to satisfy Dr. Holmes and Mr. Vyse : but. as they expected, their search was fruitless.

Towards morning she fell into a slumber. Happily so, for the events of the following day \u2014 knowledge of which could not have been kept from her \u2014 would have been anything but agreeable to her. With the morning came more law officers, a coroner, and two more doctors. An inquest was held forthwith, and after the usual routine had been gone through, the jury returned this verdict, \"Murdered by some person or persons un known.\" Not long after the inquest was held two officers be longing to the Colonel's regiment arrived at the Hall to inquire as to his whereabouts. They knew that he was a constant visitor at the Hall, and missing him from the camp on this night, this was the first place they thought of looking for him. On hearing his fate they were indeed shocked, and the idea struck them at once that he had met his death at the hands of some of the soldiers from the camp, none of whom liked their Colonel on account of his severity; but on hearing of the knife (of which they were privately informed by the chief law officer), they at once set aside this theory and fastened the guilt on Holzapfel, expressing themselves satisfied that he had been arrested. The military gentlemen having viewed the body of their respected Colonel, despatched one of the men-"], [167, "159 DOOMED. servants to their camp to inform their fellow-officers of what had occurred. All the officers off duty lost no time in coming to the Hall, and after conferriug with Dr. James aud the chief constable, they arranged that a military funeral should take place on the next day but one. The Coroner and the two extra doctors departed, their services being no longer required. Lad}' Rosalind still slept on. a heavy, dreamless sleep, and during the day Dr. James and Dr. Holmes paid her much attention. The latter, indeed, feared that she would never awake, but Dr. James assured, and reassured, him that there was no such fear. As for Edith, she was in a deplorable state about Holzapfel. She sobbed almost to heart-breaking, and could not be pacified. The day went quickly by and night came on. Old Jean Tuppitt was left up to watch by the corpse. All the others, being tired, went to rest, save the detectives, who roamed about through the Hall and its environment for the greater part of the night. It was shortly after midnight, and the gardener was sitting drowsily by the couch-side of the dead Colonel. He fell to thinking, and as he thought, he, who was well-nigh fearless, grew fearful. Sitting by himself with a cold corpse ! He trembled. But why need he fear \u2014 were not the detectives about ?"], [168, "160 LADY ROSALIND. He grew more drowsy still. He thought he saw ghosts steal by. and skip and dance -. and now he thought the sheeted figures screeched and wailed. Another moment, and his head fell forward upon his breast. He slept ! He could not have been very long asleep when a sharp, unearthly chuckle, followed quickly by a crash, made him start to his feet. His eyes were half-closed with sleep, but he was sufficiently conscious to know that someone or some thing white glided away at the end of the room. In consternation he fell back again into the chair. But no sound followed, and from this he judged that the whole thing was a dream. He turned to look at the corpse, but \u2014 oh, the horror of it ! \u2014 there was no corpse there ! He almost leaped from his seat, and straining his eyes, looked about searchingly, but, no \u2014 there was no body on the couch or elsewhere in the room ! He ran from the room, and on passing through one of the corridors he met the chief constable, to whom he narrated what had happened, trembling all over as he did so. The constable thereupon sought his confrere, and the three returned to the death-chamber. Here was a curious problem. If Holzapfel had murdered the Colonel, what object could anyone else"], [169, "161 DOOMED. have in stealing the body ? Did not this last occur rence present the possibility that the crime lay at someone else's door, and that that someone else, lurking about the place in some unknown concealment, had now, in malice, robbed the dead Colonel, denying him Christian burial ? This set the constables searching again \u2014 they even sent for four others to come and help them \u2014 but all to no purpose. The whole affair was now most mysterious. If Hol zapfel did not commit the murder, how came his knife to be found within a stone's throw of where the body was found? Who could get his knife ? All the resi dents at the Hall, so far as the constables could ascer tain, were within the house at the time the crime was committed. Who, then, outside the Hall could get the weapon ? and who outside the house could come in and steal away the body ? The whole occurrence was shrouded in deep mystery \u2014 mystery which strenuous efforts were being made to clear up, but without avail. Days came and went, but no trace of the body could be found, and at length Holzapfel's trial came on.

Trial of Holzapfel. \" The trial of Wilhelm Holzapfel for the murder of Colonel Victor De Burg, who, it will be remembered, was found dead in a grove hard by De Fordyke Hall (a secluded country residence in the South of Ire land), took place and was concluded to-day. \" Holzapfel, on being put forward, looked pale and worn, and, although being tried for his life, he seemed oblivious of what went on around him. \" The Rev. Dr. Holmes, called and sworn, deposed that he was, at the time of the murder and now, stay ing on a visit at De Fordyke Hall, where he had journeyed in order to be with his niece, who had eloped from her home in England with Mr. Holzapfel, who, he understood, was a cousin of Lady De Fordyke's. Holzapfel and the deceased, witness had observed, were very friendly, and the former always accompanied the latter part of his way home from the Hall. * I still possess this cutting, but it is so threadbare and dirty that it is absolutely impossible to say in what newspaper this account of the trial appeared, the title at the top of the sheet being altogether obliterated. 1 presume, however, that it is a cutting from the Dublin Irish Times of the period. \u2014 Auibok."], [171, "163 DOOMED. \" On the evening of the murder he did so, and after Holzapfel had been some time away the witness (who was in the sitting-room) was startled on hearing some one rush into the Hall, crying out, ' Murder ! the Colonel is dead ! ' or words to that effect. On going to the hall he found it was Holzapfel, who seemed to be much excited, and whose hands were bloody. \" On the night on which the body was stolen he (the deponent) was asleep in his own room, and heard nothing- of what had happened until aroused by the detectives. \" He was tired on the night in question (having been up all the previous night), and had gone to rest early. From what he knew of Holzapfel he did not believe that he would be capable of committing such a deed, and he thought that, although accused's knife had been found near the spot, the fact of the body of the Colonel having been secretly taken away while Holzapfel was in prison gave conclusive proof that someone else had murdered and made away with deceased. \" On cross-examination witness could not attribute any motive why Holzapfel should commit the crime, nor could he give the name of any person whom he thought might have any reason for murdering the Colonel.

He was a merchant, and had been travelling through Ireland on his holidays. He was journeying on a stage-coach which broke down, and De Fordyke Hall was the first place he came to where he could get shelter for the night. Having been very hospitably received and being on holidays he was in no hurry to leave the Hall. Hence his being there on the night of the murder of Colonel De Burg. \" At the time the crime stated that he was in his reading, and that he ran ' Murder !

His evidence merely corrobo rated what had been stated by the two former wit- nesses. \" Cross-examined, he said that he had often watched the deceased and the prisoner at the bar as they walked arm-in-arm through the grove from the Hall. He had often overheard their conversation on such occasions, and he had often heard them argue excitedly. To the best of his (witness's) knowledge and belief nothing ever passed between them, that he saw, which could possibly give rise to the belief that they nourished the slightest animosity towards each other. \" On being asked to give an idea of the class of conversations that he had overheard, the witness instanced that on one occasion the Colonel spoke of getting Mr. Holzapfel a position under the crown. \" Witness was left up on the second night after the murder to watch by the deceased. He was very tired and fell asleep. He could not have been long in this state when he was aroused by a crash of some kind in"], [174, "166 LADY\" ROSALIND. the room.

Liberty of the press, my lord \u2014 liberty of the press. The following leading article, taken from a prominent daily paper, is a good sample of what appeared in the press opinions of the time relative to the condemna tion of Holzapfel : \u2014 \" The trial of Wilhehn Holzapfel for the murder of Colonel Victor De Burg was concluded to-day, when the accused was condemned to death. \" The scene in Court was solemn and dreadful, and during the delivery of the sentence there was a dead silence in every corner of the thronged chamber. The prisoner was pale and haggard, and when the death sentence was finished he uttered not a word, but grew so weak that he had to be assisted from the dock. \" The evidence in this case, and upon which Hol zapfel was tried for his life, was altogether circum stantial, and notwithstanding that he has been doomed to capital punishment, we have no hesitation in stating, with all due deference to the law and its upholders, that it is our implicit belief that the circumstances"], [177, "A l'RESS COMMENT. 169 connected with the death of Colonel Victor De Burs are still shrouded in mystery. It is likewise our belief that circumstantial evidence is no evidence. \" Let us briefly review the facts of the case. Holzapfel was on a visit to his cousin, the Lady Rosalind De Fordyke, at the Hall, where the deceased Colonel was in the habit of visiting. \" Holzapfel and the Colonel became very friendly, and the former accompanied the latter every evening on which the Colonel was at the Hall to the end of a grove contiguous thereto. Here they parted. The Colonel went across the fields to his camp, and Holzapfel returned to the Hall. It transpired at the trial that although they were so friendly they at times argued excitedly on many trivial points, but nothing happened which would lead to the conclusion, or in any way justify the belief that Holzapfel nurtured enmity towards the deceased such as would prompt, him to commit this crime. That Colonel De Burg' was mur dered there is no doubt, for the medical evidence went to prove that the wounds upon the body of deceased could not have been self-inflicted. But there is, to our mind, every doubt as to the perpetrator of the deed. \" The fact that a knife bearing Holzapfel's name thereon was found adjacent to the scene of the murder \u2022does not, in our opinion, go to prove that Holzapfel was"], [178, "170 LADY ROSALIND. the one who did the deed ; nor does it even go to prove that the knife found was Holzapf el's. \" Would it not be quite possible for another party to get the prisoner's name engraved upon the knife in question ? \" Admitting, however, that the knife found did belong to the prisoner, would it not be possible for someone else in or about the Hall to procure the prisoner's knife for the occasion, and, knowing that Holzapfel was in the habit of accompanying the Colonel in the evening through this special grove, does it not appear more than possible that another person had taken opportunity from the time, and committed this heinous deed just after Holzapfel had parted with the Colonel, and then thrown the knife near to where the body lay ? \"We should be sorry indeed to suggest the guilt or implication of anyone in such a deplorable affair, but it seems very strange to us that more inquiries should not have been made into the career of others at the HaU. For instance, Mr. Bartholomew Vyse. Why should his own mere statement that he came to the Hall by accident be credited without corroborative evidence whatever ? Who can say that such is the case ? May not this Mr. Vyse have met with some of the Colonel's family abroad, and may he not have ollowed the Colonel in order to revenge some wrong \u2014"], [179, "A PRESS COMMENT. 171 real or imaginary r We respectfully submit that before the sentence is carried out upon Mr. Holzapfel some investigations should be made regarding the life and whereabouts of Mr. Vyse before he went to De F\\>rdyke Hall, and we think that in this we shall be supported by the greater portion of the public.\" This leading article created quite a sensation, and it was expected that the paper in which it appeared would have been punished severely for what was looked upon at the time as a gross contempt of court. But the law took no note of this press comment either in the direction of stigmatizing the paper for its action, or in the way of following up the proposal. The article, however, had one effect \u2014 it stirred up public opinion in favour of Holzapfel, and it set certain individuals thinking and suspecting.

She left the prison gate in a rather downcast mood, and proceeded to procure lodgings for herself in the town. This she succeeded in doing, and being very tired she refreshed herself with a cup of tea (taking- nothing to eat with it) and threw herself upon the bed to rest for the night. In the morning she had her breakfast early, and at a quarter to ten started for the gaol. She had no difficulty in obtaining entrance, and soon she was betny led by a gaoler through the prison corridors towards Holzapfel's cell. Edith on entering the gloomy com partment found Holzapfel sitting on the side of his prison bed. Edith was much snrprised at his changed appear ance, so thin and worn did he look. \"Edith, why did you come here? \" asked Holzapfel. sadly, looking- at her as if he were in no way astonished at her presence. \" Oh ! how can you ask me that, Wilhelm ? I love you ; I could not bear the separation.\" \"Does she really love me so much?\" thought Holzapfel, and then he said, \"Edith, why did you not try to forget me ? Why did you worry yourself coming here ? Why did you not look upon me as dead, as indeed I shall be a few weeks hence ?

' \" That's well ; I'm glad of it,\" said Holzapfel. At this point the gaoler intimated that the interview should terminate. Edith turned to leave, reminding Holzapfel ere she departed that she would be there with him again next morning. When Edith was gone Holzapfel bethought how un selfish and good-hearted she was in coming to comfort him in his sorrow. It was only now that he began to realize her worth, and he felt that he could never forgive himself for his opprobrious conduct in playing, as he had played, upon her affections. Edith, for her part, was even now broken-spirited\u2014"], [183, "175 A RISKY ESCAPE. strange what a change a short time will bring over the spirit of one's dreams! Her boisterous merriment was gone ; her thoughtlessness too, had disappeared, and she who used to be as bright and lively as Portia, was now well-nigh as melancholy and contemplative as Jacques. It was her own fault ; she had been warned, and she heeded not the warning. Edith visited her lover twice every day, spending as long with him at each visit as the prison regulations would permit. At first a gaoler was present at each interview, but seeing that Holzapfel had no other visitor, and that nothing passed between the two which in any way required watching \u2014 nothing which would arouse suspicion \u2014 a relaxation of the prison rules was granted by the authorities in Holzapfel' s case, and Edith's interviews with him latterly were permitted to take place without the obnoxious presence of the gaoler. One morning, on entering the cell, Edith saw that Holzapfel looked more cheerful than she had seen him since she first went to visit him at the prison. She was ushered in by one of the gaolers, who was eyed attentively by Holzapfel as he left the cell. \" Edith,\" said Holzapfel, in a low tone, when they were alone, \" I have yet hope of escaping from this place if you will but help me.\" Edith was about to utter a joyous exclamation, but"], [184, "176 LADY ROSALIND. Holzapfel glanced quickly towards the heavy iron door of the stone chamber and put his finger across his lips to imply silence. Edith restrained herself, and bend ing down over Holzapfel, whispered \u2014 \" How, Wilhelm ? Don't you know I would do all in my power to assist you ? \" \" I do,\" he answered, confidently ; and then lowering his voice to an almost inaudible whisper, he pointed to the tireless fireplace and said, \" I have been examining that chimney. There was a man here cleaning it the other day, and I was surprised to find that he got up through it with the greatest ease. Since then 1 have been partly up it ; there are footings in it to the top, and unless I make a great mistake, if I once got to the top and out on the roof I could easily make my escape with the assistance of a rope.\" \" I can get you the rope,\" said Edith, eagerly. \" Yes ; that's what I want you to do. Get one when you go out, and bring it with you at four o'clock. Be careful to conceal it well, for you know you will be examined coming in.\" \"Yes; I'll do that. I am always examined, but I will make sure that the rope will not be seen. But what am I to do when I bring it to you ? \" \" I shall be able to tell you that at four o'clock \" Time's up,\" cried out the gaoler, in stentorian tones, walking into the cell and eyeing the pair curiously."], [185, "177 A RISKY' ESCAPE. \" At four,\" repeated Edith, looking back anxiously at Holzapfel, as she left the cold, dank chamber. \" I wonder,\" thought Edith, as she heard the outer gate of the prison close behind her, and the heavy bolt shoot into its iron socket, \" I wonder did that turnkey suspect anything, he scrutinized us so suspiciously. No he could not,\" banishing the thought from her mind, \" he could not possibly have heard what passed between us.\" Edith proceeded to a hardware shop in the town, purchased a long and thin, yet strong rope, and then went to her lodgings. There she sat down to consider how she could hide the rope about her person so as to pass undetected into the prison. Although long, the rope was thin and by no means heavy. Edith thought of many ways of concealing it, and at last concluded that her best one was to twist it around her waist inside her bodice, and then to wear a long and loose cloak outside. She adopted this plan, and at a quarter to four started for the prison. She trembled all over as she gained admission through the front gate, and when she was being examined in the usual way, which was quite perfunctory, she felt that all her strength was leaving her. But now that dreaded ordeal of searching was over, and Edith was following a warder along the moisture-glistening passages of the huge gaol. Having ascended many N"], [186, "178 LADY ROSALIND. flights of stone stairs, and walked through many chilly corridors, she finally reached Holzapfel's cell. He had been watching eagerly for her, thinking in his anxiety that she would never come ; and now she saw a beam of gladness flit across his care-worn face. The jailer retired. Holzapfel glanced impatiently at Edith. \" I have the rope,\" she breathed, in answer to his earnest look. \"1 feared you would never have got in with it,\" said Holzapfel. \" But before we make further arrange ments I think you had better give it to me. Where is it?\" \"Around my waist,\" said Edith, looking fearfully towards the door, and unrolling the rope from her person. This she did hurriedly, and when finished she handed the coil to Holzapfel. \"Now,\" said Holzapfel, desperately, \"at twelve o'clock to-night I will be saved or doomed. I will get out on the roof by this chimney, and then I will descend by means of the rope to the ground and to liberty. It will be a great risk, for if I am caught in the act it will mean being shot immediately. But might I not as well risk being shot as to wait to be hanged \u2014 hanged like a dog for a crime I never committed ? And now, Edith, I will bid you farewell forever. You have been a kind, kind soul to me, more so than I ever deserved."], [187, "179 A RISKY ESCAPE. But enough of this. In case I do escape, Edith, where shall I find you ? \" Large tear-drops stood in Edith's eyes as she answered \u2014 \" Oh ! Wilhelm, don't speak of not escaping. Don't say that you can't escape. I cannot bear the thought now that hope has been awakened within me. Don't speak these words ! At twelve o'clock to-night, Wil helm, I will be standing beneath the black walls of the prison awaiting your descent. Oh ! don't say you will not come.\" \" Oh ! you are too good, Edith,\" said Holzapfel, feelingly; \"but if I fail to escape, try to forget me, try to forget that I ever lived.\" \" That I can never do,\" returned Edith. '\" Oh ! why did I ever go to the Rectory to cause you all this trouble ? Why was I ever born to bring you such misery ? Forgive me, Edith ! forgive me ! \" At this moment footsteps were heard without, and Holzapfel, suddenly remembering that he had the rope in his hand, jumped up, rushed over to the fire-place. and placed the coils on one of the steppings inside the chimney. He was just coming back to where Edith stood. when the ponderous door swung open, and the turnkey called out, harshly \u2014 '\u2022 Time's up.\""], [188, "180 LADY ROSALIND. But \u2014 Oh, heaven ! he must have seen Holzapfel walking from the fire-place, for he immediately went over, and, stooping down, looked up the chimney. From that he looked sharply at Holzapfel, who assumed un concern. A little shriek escaped Edith's lips ; but the jailer evidently did not hear it. He passed no remark, but walked silently to the door, and, holding it open, he again called \u2014 \" Time's up.\" Holzapfel bent and kissed Edith's forehead, and then she passed out, full of hope for her lover's freedom.

The great heav}' bell of the prison clock boomed out the eleventh hour, and Holzapfel, who was lying, resting himself, on his hard bed, arose gently and crept to the cell door. Breathless he listened. He heard nothing but the wind rushing in gusts as it whistled through the huge chimneys overhead. He listened, straining every nerve, and now he heard the regular tramp of jailers in distant corridors \u2014 jailers watching wearily through the night. He listened, but hearing no sound near his own cell, he felt that all was safe. He moved silently from the door to the fire-place, and, putting his hand up the chimney, pulled down the rope."], [189, "181 A RISKY ESCAPE. Having adjusted it so that he would have no trouble when he reached the roof, he buttoned his coat tightly about him, and hastily got inside the chimney. Slowly but surely he crept from footing to footing ; and now he felt that he must be near the top. In his excitement he endeavoured to increase the speed of his ascent ; but \u2014 Oh, horrible ! what was that noise beneath ? He listened, his heart beating wildly, but no sound followed. Yet he had heard some noise. What was it ? Ah ! he found that in his haste he had dropped the rope, which, falling in the dead silence of the night \u2014 in the lull of the winds \u2014 had caused a noise, which, though slight, seemed loud in the solemn hush of the moment. Holzapfel almost sickened to think that he would have to descend again to get the rope, for he could not proceed without it. He let himself hastily down, step by step, stood and listened a moment, picked up the coil, which had loosened slightly, and hurried up the chimney again, now much more rapidly than at first \u2014 he knew his way better. But he seemed doomed for mishap. When he reached the top he found that his progress was again impeded, for there was a heavy iron cap across the top of the flue, with just sufficient space for the smoke to pass through, but, alas ! not wide enough to permit the egress of a man. Holzapfel's courage well-nigh deserted him. Were"], [190, "182 LADY ROSALIND. all his hopes to die like dreams that die even as they are created ? Would he have to return to that abhorred cell and quietly await his doom ? Was he to be crushed and blasted thus ? No, no ! he could not, would not, think so. He grew desperate, and desperation gave him strength. He fixed one foot firmly in a footing in each side of the chimney, put the coil of rope over his head, and then, grasping one side of the iron cover in each hand with a death-like grasp, he made one Hercu lean effort, and burst it up. He sprang rapidly up through the opening, and, as he did so, he heard the massive iron cap of the chimney roll heavily down the roof and stop at the eave. A chill crept over Holzapfel as he heard it roll, and in his horror he- thought that thunder never noised so loudly. What if it was heard below ? He bent down over the chimney for an instant to listen, and, hearing nothing, he walked warily down the sloping roof to the cornice-mounted eave. He looked down from the roof, and all was black, gloomy, and silent beneath. He sat down on the ledge for a moment, and having secured one end of the rope to the cornice, he let the other dangle down the lofty wall \u2014 he knew not how lofty. Without more ado Holzapfel got hold of the rope and let himself swing in space. Slowly and gently he let himself down by little degrees. Down, down he went."], [191, "A RISKY ESCAPE. 183 When would he reach the bottom ? And now he was seized with a dreadful apprehension. What if the rope were too short ? Oh ! let him not dwell on the thought. Still he descended, and at last his appre hension proved only too true. He had reached the end of the rope, and still he knew not but that he might have been fifty feet from the ground \u2014 the ground ? nay, perhaps the river ! He strained his eyes looking down into the darkness, but alas ! darkness was all that he could see. He strained his ears listening for some single sound, but oh ! he heard none \u2014 none save the moaning of the rest less winds. He shuddered to think that even at that moment he might have been missed from the cell and pursued. The thought made him reckless ; he let go the rope, and in about two seconds came heavily to the ground. He was considerably stunned, but uninjured, and realizing the necessity of making a hasty retreat to some hiding-place where he could stay in safety until the storm which would result from his disappearance would have subsided, he sprang to his feet, and ran hurriedly along by the prison wall. In the dark, in his precipitation, he rushed against something or somebody. What, or who was it ?

I know I should be safe there.\" \" I will go with you, Wilhelm, and keep you com pany in your solitude.\" Holzapfel consented, and Edith having given him a false beard and a long cloak, for which he felt thank ful, they hastened away from the prison, and in a little time had left the town at a considerable distance be hind them."], [193, "CHAPTER XXII. HE AROSE EVEN AS THE PH\u0152NIX. There be chambers in the bosom of the ocean. \u25a0Claude Chantbperdrlx still lived in the body of the sea monster, in the depths of the ocean. Down amid the green-clad and lustrous caverns he moved about, and slumbered oft. Now and then he came forth from the chambers beneath, and floating to the water's surface he chased the flying fish with eagerness, and frequently succeeded in catching it. He hovered through the pearly abode, now amid dark labyrinthic rocks and recesses, now through the palace of lights, and occasionally he entered by the translucent passage into the habitation of the queen, where dwelt those nymph like beings who played on rapturous instruments, causing the unearthly dwelling to ring throughout with weird and charming music, there where sweet-smelling incense ever floated through the balmy waters. As time rolled on he discovered new charms and things of beauty in that dwelling in the waters ; but soon the charm wore away, things that at first shone"], [194, "186 LADY ROSALIND. like a sparkling- diamond seemed now as dull as the lustreless lead, and Claude grew weary and sad. His immortal part was in a state of perpetual unrest, and \u00bb memoiy, friend of grief, was ever at work with a torturing activity. Yes, sad memories rose within him, and to stifle them he found it would be necessary to have some em ployment, constant and engrossing, which would engage his every faculty. He tried to think of some other means to this end besides pursuing the flying-fish, but he could devise none. Indeed, he might not have troubled himself on such a point, for he should have known that if any other pastime could be had, it would have been discovered ere this by those other creatures who dwelt there a long, long time before he did. Thus he had to rest satisfied with this the only occu pation which would murder memory, keeping all the faculties employed. One day Claude was following one of those little fly ing-fish ; he was propelling his cumbrous form at an impetuous rate just beneath the surface of the waters, while his prey was diving through the air above, shining like silver in the warm rays of the sun. The little creature was just descending to moisten its wings, and in another moment would have been caught by Claude, but just then some dark object seemed to float between them, obstructing Claude's vision."], [195, "187 HE AROSE EVEN AS THE PH\u0152NIX. Having already, however, given himself the upward motion, he could not now stop, and instantly he felt his head, or rather the head of his piscine prison, bang against some hard substance. It was the bottom of a huge vessel ! He was con siderably stunned, but presently he commenced to think of what one of the other creatures of the deep had told him about the flying-fish letting itself fall upon the deck of a passing- vessel rather than be caught by them. Forgetting for the time that he had also been warned about being caught himself by the sailors, he imme diately got from under the vessel, swam to the surface of the waters, and, resting in an incumbent position, he surveyed from end to end the large barque against which he had struck. The sailors were looking over her sides with the gaze of expectancy ; they had seen the flying-fish drop on the deck, they knew it was being followed, and now they were looking out for the follower. No sooner had Claude made his appearance than he perceived that he was seen by the men on board. He was about to plunge beneath, when he heard the report of a gun, and then sensations exactly similar to those he experienced on the night he was devoured by the monster crept over him. Consciousness by degrees left him.

He could hardly bring himself to believe that he was a human being once more. He felt like one awaking from a hideous nightmare, and when at length he realized his position he turned to the captain of the vessel, who was eyeing him curiously, and inquired how he came there. The captain told him a strange story. \" You see,\" he said, \"one of those flying-fish dropped on deck. We knew by experience that some larger fish was following it in the waters \u2014 the dolphin, we thought \u2014 but on looking out we saw a huge monster erecting itself out of the waters and evidently looking to find its prey. We had seldom seen its like before, and I gave orders for some of the men to fire at it. They did so, and the shots took effect ; but, oh ! wonders ! instead of falling a dead mass on the waters, the monster went on fire, flame and smoke ascending in dense volumes from its burning body. Soon, however, the fire and fumes decreased, and then we saw the \u2022\u25a0barred body fall into black ashes and dust, and lo !"], [197, "189 HE AROSE EVEN AS THE PH\u0152NIX. from out the centre your stately figure ascended, even as the fabled Ph\u0153nix arose from its own ashes.

And now tell me who you are, and where youcome from.\" Claude was scarce himself yet, and it cost him a great effort to concentrate his senses. When he suc ceeded in doing so, he told his story to the captain, stating that he was drowned \u2014 a slight misrepresenta tion \u2014 and detailing his experiences in the bottom of the sea. The captain and crew were at first dubious, yet there was the living proof before them, and in truth no one was more surprised at the strange transformation than was Claude himself. There was a wedding party on board, and Claude felt so elated and inspirited that he joined in the festivities. He danced and enjoyed himself just as much as anyone of the party, and it was not until the vessel reached its destination that he became really awake to his position.

Claude Chanteperdrix, the gentleman, the scholar, was obliged to toil and labour even as the most com mon and illiterate man who earned his bread at the wharves. Oh ! it was a crushing fall. And then the thoughts of going home a beggar, and of facing his wife, having given her property over to Rembrandt, were almost too much for him ; but he was deter mined to go back \u2014 back to Ireland, if it were only to see, for one instant, his wife's dear face, and then to fly and bury himself in oblivion to the end of his days."], [199, "CHAPTER XXIII. AN INQUISITIVE BEGGAR. WHO ? Never take a book by its cover. It was midday, and in the gardens at De Fordyke Hall old Jean Tuppitt was looking after some pot plants that required his own special care. It was just ten days after Holzapfel had been con demned for the murder, and the head gardener was beginning to revolve in his mind all the mysterious cir cumstances of the case, when, on rising from his work. he beheld through the trees, at a short distance, a much-deformed figure hobbling- rather than walking towards him. As the stranger came closer, he con cluded from his garb and appearance that he was one of the travelling beggars who so often visited these parts. The stranger was very, very poorly clad, his clothes being all torn, and his shoes old and broken. He wore his hair long, and had a black scraggy beard, while a piece of thick black cloth, tied on with a string, did service for a hat. There was a peculiar sharpness about his features,"], [200, "192 LADY ROSALIND. and his eyes, intensely black, contained more fire than is usually to be seen in the eyes of such a decrepit and ancient man as he. By the aid of a stick, which old Jean had not noticed before, he shuffled up to the gardener, and thus addressed him \u2014 \" Pardon me, sir, but might I crave a small piece of bread ? I have travelled a long, long distance by the road, and I am hungry and sick \u2014 sick in body and sick in soul.\" \" My poor man,\" said the old gardener, pitifully, for he was naturally good-natured, \" come with me, and I will soon procure j'ou something, both to eat and drink.\" So saying he led the way, and the beggar followed to the entrance of the Hall, where the latter stayed whilst the gardener went in to get some bread and butter, meat and milk. He soon returned with a chair, and the poor beggar, seating himself, partook of the aforementioned eatables as if he had not tasted a bit for days. Wlien he had finished he handed the empty vessels to the old gardener, and said \u2014 \" God bless you, sir, and prolong your days. From my heart 1 pray a blessing upon this house, its master, and every soul beneath its roof.\" \" Alas ! my master sleeps in yonder graveyard these many years ; and as for blessings on the house, there"], [201, "193 AN INQUISITIVE BEGGAR.

Poor Colonel De Burg, a nice gentleman, who used to visit my lady, was found mur dered a short way up that walk,\" said Jean Tuppitt, pointing to the Lady Rosalind's walk, and not uoticing the anxious expression that hung on the features of the beggar. \"The Lord be merciful to him ! \" prayed the stranger. \" And who committed the dreadful crime \u2014 can they not be found ? \" questioned the beggar. eagerly. \" That's a mystery,\" said the gardener, \" but suspicion fell upon a young g-entleman who was stop ping here on a visit \u2014 a distant relative, I believe, of my mistress \u2014 who used to keep company with the Colonel, and who was last seen with him on that unlucky even ing. The young gentleman has been condemned to death, but I don't believe the poor young fellow ever committed the deed. It must have been one of the Colonel's subordinates in the camp on the mountain that murdered him \u2014 one, perhaps, who had some spite against the commander.\" Old Jean was full of this engrossing topic, and being u"], [202, "194 LADY ROSALIND. of a communicative nature, was glad to see anyone taking an interest in his ideas on the subject, even a beggar. \" Well ?\" questioned the beggar, earnestly. \" 'Tis rumoured,\" continued the gardener, \" that the Colonel was paying his respects to my lady, and that her relation in jealousy made away with the Colonel's life. I don't think that such is the case, for the young gentleman came down here with a clergyman and his niece, a handsome girl, to whom they say Mr. Hol zapfel was engaged.\" The beggar started on hearing the name Holzapfel. \" The young lady disappeared shortly after Mr. Hol zapfel was condemned, but her uncle is here still, and seems to be puzzled to know what to do about his niece \u2014 he does not know where to look for her.\" \"But \u2014 the \u2014 lad}- of the house herself \u2014 how is she ?\" almost gasped the ragged stranger, his eyes growing still wilder in appearance. \"She must have been shocked ! \" \" Poor lady ! \" said old Tuppitt, sorrowfully, \" she always was sad, but this last affair upset her awfully ; indeed, only for the clergyman, who is so kind in stopping with her, and another kind gentleman who, a few months ago, broke down on the roadside while travelling by at night, who is here still, I don't know what she would do at all.\""], [203, "AN INQUISITIVE BEGGAR.

Cod speed you, and bring you safely to your destina tion.\" \" Amen,\" added the other. The beggar went his way, and the gardener pro ceeded to resume his duties in the garden. Let us follow the beggar. He shuffled away from the Hall, still bent, and Jean Tuppitt watched him until he was out of sight. When the beggar was sure that he could be seen no longer, he stood erect, and walked at a rapid pace through the fields. In a few moments he halted at a thickset hedge, and kneeling- down beside it, he put his hand in, and drew forth a black bag. Then he looked around him stealthily, stood up, and slowly retraced his steps towards the Hall. When he reached its environs he lingered about .amid shadowed and secluded places, unnoticed, until"], [204, "196 LADY ROSALIND. nightfall. Then he crept to the rear of the house, and, silently raising the latch of a ponderous door, he entered noiselessly. Having secured the door behind him, he stole quietly and quickly along the dark base ment corridor. Then he proceeded to the damp wine cellar, from thence through a dangerous iron trap-door, down into an apartment still more damp and chill ; and finally through a stiff, rusty iron door, into an adjoining chamber. Here he stopped. Looking around him, he saw that there was an aperture in the wall, through which, at that moment, a solitary moonbeam found its way, slightly relieving the darkness of the place. He saw, too, that there was a flat stone block, fast in the stone floor, in a corner of the gloomy cell. On this he sat down to rest himself, and opening the bag which he had taken from the hedge, he took from it some bread and meat, of which he ate heartily. Almost immediately several large rats came out and played around him, and the beggar, pitying their hunger, fed them from his hand. \" Poor little creatures,\" he muttered, \" they're well nigh forsaken and solitary as I am, but they have their own fellowship \u2014 I am derelict. Aye ! I am more miserable even than a rat.\" The beggar stood up, and now he took from his face the scraggy beard he had been wearing ! He smoothed"], [205, "AN INQUISITIVE BEGGAR. WHO? 197 flown with his hands his black curly locks of hair, took off his ragged apparel, which concealed a plain black suit; and supplied himself with boots and a slouched hat from his black bag. Claude Chauteperdrix (for it was he), the lawful husband of Lady Rosalind de Fordyke. sat down again upon the stone block, sat down to contemplate. And, oh ! he was weary. It was true what he had told the gardener \u2014 he was \" sick in body and sick in soul.\" He had worked his way from America on a home bound vessel, the Peri, and he was thoroughly worn out when he reached the Hall. Sitting there in the damp vault he revolved in his mind all that the gardener had told him. His wife had not married again, but one Colonel De Burg had been paying her attention, aud he had been murdered. A Mr. Holzapfel, stopping at the Hall, had been con demned for the murder. That was the very name of the fellow for whom Claude had committed the forgery that drove him out of the country. Could it be the same ? \"Yet,\" thought Claude, \"I never heard that my wife had a relative of that name. If she had anyone of that name belonging to her she must not have been aware of the fact, or she would have said something about it at the time of the forgery ; or else she was"], [206, "198 LADY ROSALIND. desirous of hiding- her relationship with such a scape grace. And then there was this Holzapfel's intended wife; also her uncle, a clergyman; and likewise a gentleman who had broken down on the road. It comes to this : That there are at present in the Hall my wife, the clergyman, another gentleman, and, 1 suppose, servants as of old. My poor wife's nerves must, indeed, be shattered. How can I make my presence here known to her ? I won't do so just now. I must find out for myself how she is, though, and what her guests are like. I'll stay in this place for a while, and creep ing through the secret passages (if I can find my way about) I'll watch and see all that goes on. It will not do to let anyone else save my wife know that I am here ; if I did a far worse fate than banishment might await me. Aye, and might it not be said, too, that the man who could commit a forgery could also murder ? Why, I would be the most likely person in the world to murder the man who sought to marry my wife ! \" Having thus thought over the situation, Claude stood up and groped his way from one chamber to another, and then by steep stone stairs and broken ladders from passage to passage through the walls. He listened here and there for any human sound, but was for a long time unsuccessful. Ultimately he heard the murmur of voices in an upward direction. He ascended another flight of stairs, and as he did so the"], [207, "199 AN INQUISITIVE BEGGAR. WHO? sound grew more distinct, but when he reached the top it had completely died away. He had lost the track, and now he groped about again ; but he could hear nothing, and so had to return in a disheartened mood to the cellar from which he started without having satisfied his legitimate curiosity in any way. He was determined, however, to pursue his examination of the place after he had got a little rest. He was very weary and sleepy (he had not closed his eyes for four days), and, making a pillow of the old ragged clothes in which he had come to the Hall, he stretched himself on the hard, rugged floor and slept the heavy sleep of the weary. Ah ! sleep \u2014 sleep on, thou troubled, perturbed spirit! Sleep and think not, for 'tis sad betimes to think !"], [208, "CHAPTER XXIV. WHAT DR. HOLMES SUGGESTED.

It was a cold, bleak, dark night \u2014 the very night on which Holzapfel escaped from prison, and that, too, following- Claude's surreptitious arrival at the Hall ; and in the drawing-room thereat a brig-ht fire blazed on the hearth. The curtains were drawn, the shutters barred, and around the fire were sitting, in comfortable easy chairs, the Lady Rosalind and her guests \u2014 Doctor Holmes and Bartholomew Vyse. All three were silent, and, as might be expected, their thoughts ran \u2014 oh ! how differently \u2014 on the all engrossing subject of the murder. They had been, but a very short time previously, discussing and perpending the various circumstances of the case, and the almost innumerable theories suggested by the newspapers regarding the commis sion of the terrible crime and the probable criminal \u2014 for on this point there was a divergence of opinion on the part of the press. Little did they dream, while"], [209, "201 WHAT DR.

Suddenly Dr. Holmes broke the silence by starting from his chair, pacing the room hurriedly for a moment or two, and then exclaiming \u2014 \" I have a sure method of finding the murderer! \" How ? \" eagerly inquired Lady Rosalind, who was somewhat startled by the Doctor's unusual abruptness. Her eagerness, indeed, was great ; the prospect of certainly finding out the criminal was a thing she had not anticipated, and the outlook almost overpowered her; and how, she thought, could Dr. Holmes know anything of the murderer, and what was the method of which he spoke ? Yet she knew that he was not a man to make a suggestion of this kind on such a vital question without good reason for so doing. These thoughts flashed with the rapidity of light ning through her brain. \" Mine,\" said the Doctor, \" is a strange, but. never theless, a sure way, but I shall require the willing co-operation of yourself and Mr. Vyse for the per formance of the task.\" \" I am quite willing, nay, I would be very anxious to exert myself to the utmost to further any plan which you might suggest to try and find the murderer, for I certainly don't believe that Mr. Holzapfel ever perpe-"], [210, "202 LADY ROSALIND. trated that dreadful crime,\" said Bartholomew Vyser with apparent earnestness. \" And,\" said Lady Rosalind, \" you know my anxiety about the matter.\" \"Very well, then,\" said the Doctor, \"my plan is this : You both believe in spiritualism and animal magnetism ? \" \" I do. implicitly,\" answered the lady. Mr. Vyse hesitated a little, and then said, iu a care less sort of way \u2014 \" W-e-e-U, I never gave very much consideration to the subject, but I will, for this occasion \u2014 if it favours your project \u2014 force my will into the belief.\" \" That's right \u2014 that's all I require,\" said Dr. Holmes. with an air of satisfaction, as well as solemnity. He added. \" Now, I propose to call forth the spirit of the murdered man, and to inquire of him who his assassin was ; thus we may trace the culprit.\" On hearing this proposal both Lady Rosalind and Mr. Vyse turned pale, and the latter started from his seat and walked hurriedly to and fro ! \" You seem agitated,\" said Dr. Holmes. \" Oh, no ! no!\" replied Mr. Vyse ; \" but ever since the evening of the tragic occurrence my nerves have been a little shaken ; indeed, never having seen a murdered person before, my nerves are completely unstrung- since then.\""], [211, "203 WHAT DR. HOLMES SUGGESTED. The speaker resumed his seat, and, to say truly, his nerves did seem unstrung, for his face was now of a livid hue. and he trembled all over like a wind-shaken osier ; but this (owing to his position at the fire) was unnoticed either by the lady or the Doctor. The latter assumed indifference, and continued \u2014 \" In order to carry out this plan we must hold ;r seance; and, so that we can all see the spirit, we shall require a fourth person to act as ' medium.' Who can we get ? \" \" I think,\" answered Lady Rosalind, after a moment's reflection, \" that old Jean, the gardener, is the best person we can procure for the purpose.\" So saying, she touched a gong that stood on the table. A servant entered ; the Lady Rosalind directed her to send in the gardener, and in a few moments the faithful old Jean made his appearance. He was soon provided with a seat at the fire, and Dr. Holmes, having conversed with him on various topics for a short time, asked him if he believed in spiritualism. \"Yes, sir,\" replied the stooped and white-haired gardener. Having explained more fully their intention to the old servant, they all drew round a small table, the Doctor first putting out the light, which, he contended, would create an influence in the air which would be"], [212, "204 LADY ROSALIND. detrimental to the appearance of spirits. The room was then void of light save for the flickering of the tire. Having all joined wills and put down their hands in an extended position on the small table, so that the extremities of their little fingers and thumbs touched one another, it was not long before Jean Tuppitt was heavily under a mesmeric influence. Presently he uttered long and earnest sentences in a language alto gether unknown to his hearers \u2014 he was conversing with the spirit of a long-departed Egyptian prince, which was necessary in order to effect the desired communication. When he ceased to speak the apartment trembled as would a ship tossing on the ocean at the mercy of winds and waves ; indeed, several of the quaint orna ments that hung- against the walls were precipitated on the floor. A gentle air swept by them, as if caused by the rustling robes of a person passing hurriedly by; it seemed to breathe softly on their outspread hands as it fled past, and then all was still, and over against the north wall of the room there appeared the shadow, or as the Romans called it, the lemure, of Colonel Victor De Burg. The head was upturned, the face would <nve the impression of excruciating torture, the eyes wore a glassy, frightened aspect, whilst the hair stood upright"], [213, "205 WHAT DR. HOLMES SUGGESTED. on the head. In the throat were two deep wounds. from which the blood issued freely. The \"medium\" slept on peacefully, but the onlookers were greatly terrified. Gladly would Lady Rosalind and Mr. Vyse have brought to an end this dreadful scene, but the air seemed electrified, and they were struck dumb ; so completely bewildered were they, and so thoroughly under the magnetic influence that they were powerless to move. The latter was so seized with horror that the dews of dread stood in large, cold drops upon his forehead, and his eyes were as glaring and glassy as those of the apparition. Dr. Holmes was about to question the shadow, but before he had time to break the awful, painful silence which reigned, a still small voice, coming not as if from the spirit's self, but rather from the direction of tin spirit, exclaimed \u2014 \" You called upon me. Why do you call ? I answer your invocation.\" \"Alas! poor shadow,\" said the Doctor, his voice faltering and quivering with emotion, \" 1 called you to inquire of you who it was that put an end to your existence, so that the perpetrator of this heinous deed may be quickly brought to justice.\" \" There ! There is the murderer ! Dismiss me ! \" cried the shade, as it pointed at Mr. Vyse. eyeing him furiously, and then it disappeared."], [214, "206 LADY ROSALIND. The medium woke up ; Lady Rosalind sat motionless and pale in her chair, as if in a dream ; the Doctor stood mutely gazing at where the shade had appeared ; and Mr. Vyse, seeming like one dumb-founded, like one \" tongue-tied in his guiltiness,\" sat stark, staring. and silent for several moments. He was the first to break the silence, and then he started up and exclaimed \u2014 \" \"Tis false ; it's a mere illusion ! \u2014 a fancy ! \" And then he groaned, \" Oh, God ! \" and sank back into his chair. Lady Rosalind, on hearing his voice, was awakened as if from dreamland to real life. She grew faint and weak, and had to be assisted to her room by the Doctor and the servants. Dr. Holmes and the old gardener kept tolerably calm under the circumstances, and the Doctor having seen that Lady Rosalind was looked to by one of her maid servants (who promised to watch her during the night ), retired to his own room without again seeing Mi- Vyse. He was very much agitated, and did not go to bed for some time. As he thought over what had happened he was convinced that it was Mr. Vyse that murdered the Colonel ; still, it seemed to him highly improbable that one who had come there by accident, and who had known the Colonel for so short a time, could have any motive in committing such a crime. Surely Mr. Vyse"], [215, "207 WHAT DR. HOLMES SUGGESTED. could not have fallen in love with Lady Rosalind, and have murdered the Colonel through jealousy. No, that \u25a0could hardly be. Mr. Vyse never betrayed any sign of affection for her ladyship. Yet the Doctor looked upon the test which he had tried as unerring; he never knew it to fail before, and he could not think that it had failed now. \" As for Holzapfel,\" thought the Doctor, \" the evi dence, circumstantial though it be, is very strong against him. and in his ease jealousy might be the cause,\" for the Doctor felt sure that Holzapfel cared more for his cousin than for Edith, to whom he was engaged. Nevertheless, Dr. Holmes had a higher opinion of Holzapfel than to conclude that he perpetrated this dreadful deed; he was wild, but there was nothing really bad in him. \"1 don't know what to do,\" murmured the Doctor: \" there would be no use in informing the authorities about this proof of the murderer, such evidence, in fallible though it be. would not be accepted in a court of law. I'll let matters rest for a while, trusting in God that He will bring the guilty to justice. I'm sorry, very sorry, I ever came to this place. Edith has caused me all this trouble. I wonder where she is now, poor child \u2014 I'm very uneasy about her. If I only knew in what direction she has gone ! Perhaps"], [216, "208 LADY ROSALIND. back to the Rectory, or maybe to the town where Holzapfel is imprisoned. I would wish to seek her out, but I can't leave here now ; I must watch this Mr. Vyse. It would be wrong to leave Lady Rosalind alone in this house with such a man \u2014 a murderer ; I'm sure he's the murderer.\" Dr. Holmes shortly afterwards laid himself down to sleep, lamenting ere he slept that he had ever brought Holzapfel to the Rectory. Meanwhile Mr. Vyse had gone up to his room, and there he paced up and down, from end to end, like one insane, muttering and stammering-, and wildly beating the air with his arms. He continued in this state for well-nigh two hours, by which time he was thoroughly exhausted, and throwing himself upon a couch he fell into a troubled, unquiet slumber, from which he started nervously several times during the night."], [217, "CHAPTER XXV. THE MURDERER Men are not what they seem. Next day Lady Rosalind was too unwell to leave her rooms upstairs and come down to the sitting-room. Dr. Holmes paid her several visits during the day, and tried to keep her thoughts, for the present, from the events of the previous night. She positively refused to see Mr. Vyse, saying that she was too unwell to do so ; and he, apparently un concerned, spent the day chiefly in the grounds. Night at length arrived. All had retired to rest, and shortly after the turret clock of the Hall had chimed the tenth hour, Lady Rosalind, tired and exhausted, was asleep in a reclining position on a massive oak, plush-covered couch in one of the upper apartments of the old mansion. She lay near the edge of the couch with one arm hanging down to the ground, her white fingers resting upon the richly flowered carpet.

She slept, and, sleeping, dreamt ; sweet scenes attended her smiling slumbers. Little dreamt she, however (although her vision was of Claude Chanteperdrix, her beloved husband), that he, at that moment, was standing enchanted, spell bound by her side. He had at last found the proper passages, and now beside his sleeping wife he stood pale, disappointed, and worn, haggard-looking as any man of fourscore, after a life of toil. \" How can I ever bring myself to appear before her again ? \" thought he. \" Six years ago I left her a ruined, disgraced man. But she loved me then ; does she love me still ? What if Rembrandt should turn up with the deed, take possession of this house, and throw her friendless upon the world ! But no, he could not, with all his callousness, be guilty of such an act as that. He shall never do it while I live. And yet did he not, when in my desperation I threw myself"], [219, "211 THE MURDERER. overboard, dash me from him, instead of trying to save my life ? Aye, and first secured the belt of diamonds which was fastened around my waist. Would that I knew where he was now. How could she love me if she knew of this deed, handing over her property to a stranger ? She does not love me. I can never, never let her know that I am here ! \" Large tear-drops stood in Claude's eyes, but instantly his flow of thoughts was checked by a shuffling, stealthy sound, coming from the direction of the door of the apartment, as if someone were stealing along the corridor outside- He thought that it was one of the servants, and had barely time to push back the panel in the wall through which he had entered, and make his exit, drawing the arras and panel close after him, when the handle of the door was turned, slowly and softly, and Bartholomew Vyse, not one of the servants, sneaked like a guilty thing into the room, closing the door, and locking it carefully, behind him ; and on seeing Lady Rosalind a silent, suppressed chuckle escaped his lips. He cast a searching glance about, and seeing that he was unobserved, he crept quietly over to a bureau which rested on an iron stand in a remote corner of the room, and in which were locked all the family wills and deeds, together with a considerable sum of money. He made several attempts to open it, trying every one of a large bunch of keys"], [220, "212 LADY ROSALIND. which he drew from one of his pockets, but all to no purpose. He searched about the room in every con ceivable nook and crevice, and failing again he flew into a rage, and could hardly restrain himself suffi ciently to preserve the silence which was so essential to the carrying out of his wicked plot. He, however, was determined that he would get the key at any cost. He put his brains to work, and the idea flashed across his mind that the key might be in the possession of the sleeper. The first place he thought of trying was under the pillow on which the lady's head so peacefully rested. He drew closer, and was proceeding to raise, as gently as possible, the corner of the pillow when the lady slightly moved her head. Fearing that she was waking up, Bartholomew Vyse, quick as thought, let himself down softly on his back beside the couch and rolled in under it. After a few moments, hearing no sound but that of the beating of his own heart and the breathing of Lady Rosalind, he ventured to come out from his hiding-place. Kneeling by the side of the couch he again raised the end of the pillow ; again the lady moved, and again he rapidly slipped under the couch ; but this time he was satisfied that the key was not under the pillow. He lay there for a few moments, but he heard no sound. He was just about to rise up and search the lady's person when he suddenly espied, in her hanging hand, the object of his search. It was"], [221, "213 THE MURDERER. secured to her slender wrist by means of a blue silk tape. How was he to get it off without awakening the sleeper ! He took a dagger from one of his inside pockets, and cautiously making the loose part of the tape which encircled Lady Rosalind's wrist into a loop, he put the blade through it and cut it across. Both the key and the tape fell noiselessly on the carpet. After waiting with watchful ear for another few moments Bartholomew Vyse again crept from his con cealment. He was making eagerly for the bureau, when, in his hurry, he knocked against a large and weighty oaken chair, causing it to fall with a heavy thud. The Lady Rosalind started up, and sprang with terror into the middle of the room. \" God defend us ! \" she exclaimed. \" Who is that ? \" \" Don't be afraid,\" said Vyse, in a sneering, sarcastic tone, \" it is only Mr. Vyse.\" Suddenly missing the key from her wrist, Lady Rosalind, pointing at Vyse, cried out \u2014 \" Villain ! robber ! give me my key.\" \" Nay, do not storm, gentle lady,\" returned Bartholo mew Vyse ; \" I have a better right to that key than you have. I came here to speak quietly with you, and you must hear me. It was not accident that brought me to this house,\" he continued, in a stern, bitter voice"], [222, "214 LADY ROSALIND. \" When I was a mere child, my father (on account of false information given about him by a certain gentle man, who was prompted by ancestral animosity) was cruelly incarcerated in a cold, damp cell in Dublin Castle. His health soon broke down, owing to the brutal manner in which he was treated ; he took fever and shortly afterwards died. My mother (the onlv living creature who cared about me, who loved me, and whom I loved) died of a broken heart, and I was thrown helpless, hopeless upon the world \u2014 a world which has been harsh and unpitying towards me. As I grew up, revenge for my father's wrongs, which were likewise my wrongs, was the one object of my life. I sought out my father's oppressor \u2014 his murderer \u2014 and in an attempt to shoot him I was recognized. I was tracked, and but barely escaped to Africa with my life. The feelings of revenge were, however, still strong within me ; and while I lived in exile in that God-forsakeu country, I met with a young man \u2014 an injured exile like myself. We lived together for five years, and at the end of that time we came across diamonds to the amount of fifty thousand pounds, which we divided between us, and waited our opportunity to sail for our native country. The first night we were on board the home-bound barque we gambled between ourselves, and my comrade having lost all his diamonds and money, put his property in Ireland at stake in the"], [223, "THE MURDERER. 215 hope of recovering his share of the diamonds. Luck, however, was against him ; he lost his property, and by the aid of a legal gentleman on board a deed was drawn up giving me full possession thereof. I thrust it carelessly into my pocket, and paced the cabin un certain whether I would keep it or not. Presently my companion left me, and almost immediately afterwards the cry of ' A man overboard ! ' rang through the ship, from stem to stern, from deck to keel. It was my companion. Poor devil ! he committed suicide. I, in common with many others on board, tried to save him, but without success. I felt sorrowful at first, but rushing to the cabin I pulled the deed from my pocket and read it hurriedly, aud when I did all my sorrow for the suicide was at an end, for I found that now at last I had an opportunity, which I never anticipated, of revenging myself upon my parents' murderer, and the destroyer of my own prospects in life. Here is the document,\" added Bartholomew Vyse, as he drew a parchment sheet from an inside pocket, and placed it, with a hideous chuckle, in the hands of Lady Rosalind, who, by this time, was pale \u2014 deadly pale \u2014 and well nigh speechless. She was so unnerved and powerless that she let the paper drop to the ground. \" Read it,\" said Vyse, in a commanding tone. \" for it concerns you. That man who wronged me, and"], [224, "216 LADY ROSALIND. against whom, and his posterity, I have sworn ven geance, was your father, and the suicide who made the will was your husband ; I now own this house and all the surrounding property, and I leave two courses of action open to you. Either become my wife and live here happily, or be prepared to leave this house for ever within the next week ! \" The Lady Rosalind, who, up to this, stood mute and motionless, now snatched up the deed and glanced cursorily over it. In a moment she exclaimed \u2014 \" Base wretch ! My husband would not, nor never did, consent to the execution of such a deed. 'Tis false ! I'll burn it.\" \" Give it to me,\" cried Vyse, imperatively. \" If you do not marry me I'll go to law for what is justly mine, and throw you upon the roadside.\" \" I'll never marry you, nor will you ever get this false document,\" said Lady Rosalind, determinedly. Vyse was about to force it from her, when she cried out loudly \u2014 \" Unhand me, villain, or I'll call up the household, and have you handed over, as a housebreaker and an impostor, to the authorities.\" \" Beware what you do,\" said Vyse, as he grasped her by the wrist with one hand, whilst in the other he held a dagger, turning it round and round with rest less rapidity. \" Be cautious,\" he hissed with rage,"], [225, "THE MURDERER. 217 through his teeth, \" or I will make as short work of you as I did of your lover, Colonel De Burg ; aye. and stow away your body, too, as I did with him.\" At this juncture Vyse upraised the dagger in the air, and in his rage and fury would have plunged it into the heart of Lady Rosalind (who by this time was on the point of swooning) were it not that Claude Chanteperdrix, seeing the imminent danger in which his wife was placed, rushed from his place of ambush, caught Bartholomew Vyse by the back of the neck, wrenched the dagger from his clenched fist, and hurled him headlong to the end of the room. \"Rosalind! my Rosalind!\" he exclaimed, as she sank senseless into his extended arms. Suddenly remembering the position he was in, he wheeled quickly round, not one whit too soon, for Vyse was close behind him. The moment their eyes met Vyse shrank back, and crouched and cringed like one frightened at the appearance of some ghostly appari tion. Claude, still supporting his wife on his left arm, pointed with his right hand, and glanced furiously at the doubled-up figure before him, exclaiming \u2014 \" So this is your revenge, Jacques Rembrandt ! This is the family you have sworn vengeance against ! You it was that murdered Colonel De Burg ! You thought you had despatched me, but the waves showed more mercy than you did, and now I am here to bring you to"], [226, "218 LADY' ROSALIND. justice. Move not an inch ! \" exclaimed Claude, seeing that Rembrandt was sneaking to a panel in the wall. Rembrandt sprang to the exit, seeing which Claude quickly and gently placed his wife upon the couch on which she had previously been sleeping, and dashed towards him. He caught him by the hair, but it was only a black wiar, and came off in his hand, and Rembrandt dis appeared through the panel. Claude pursued, and as he did. he heard the footsteps recede and recede until they had grown almost inaudible. Still he followed, and now he stood still and listened, but all sounds had died away. He heard a hollow laugh echo in the distance as he turned to retrace his steps, and follow ing the laugh he heard the voice of Rembrandt (which he knew so well) cry out triumphantly \u2014 \" Curse them ! they'll never get me here ! \" Claude almost trembled at the words, and fearful lest Rembrandt should creep silently towards him in the darkness and give him a death-blow, he quickened his pace through passages and up broken stairs until he reached the room in which he had left Lady Rosalind in au insensible condition on the oak couch. Now he had time to breathe and to reflect on what had happened. His wife's father was the man who had wronged Rembrandt and his family, and Rembrandt, having got Claude's deed or will, had thus accidentally"], [227, "219 THE MURDERER. found a means of revenge, and had travelled to the Hall with this foul end in view. Lady Rosalind was the only living member of the family, and seeing that she was young and handsome he had made up his mind to marry her, instead of throwing her helpless upon the roadside. Colonel De Burg, he saw, was an obstacle in his way in this direction, and so he had murdered him. Then he tried to frighten Lady Rosalind into marrying him, and she, contemptuously refusing him, would, in all probability, have shared the fate of the Colonel had not Claude turned up at the proper time. Thus did Claude's thoughts run when Lady Rosa lind moved slightly, stopping his flow of thought. And then he knelt beside her at the couch, and, bending over, kissed her pale cheek, thanking the Fates for permitting them to meet even once again. Claude had no restoratives that he could administer to his wife, but, seeing that she moved occasionally, and that she breathed freely, he concluded that she had passed from a fainting to a sleeping state, and so his mind was set at rest as to her safety. He paced the room from hour to hour, watching and thinking. The grey dawn was stealing over the distant hills, driving away the spirits of night, when Lady Rosalind raised her head from the couch and looked dreamily"], [228, "220 LADY ROSALIND. about her. Claude walked over and stood before her, looking lovingly upon her truly beautiful face. \"Claude! Claude!\" she murmured, stretching out her hands and gazing at him, as if she thought he were a mere vision \u2014 a dream whose presence pleased her. \" Yes, Rosalind, I am here,\" he answered, in his softest and most melodious tones. She sprang from the couch and threw herself into his open arms, still looking dreamily into his sorrowful face. \" I have been watching for you \u2014 watching for you, Claude, these years. Do I dream ? Are you really come ? I thought you would never return.\" \" I am really here, Rosalind ; I have worked my way back from America. Let us be seated, Rosalind, and I will tell you all.\" They sat on the side of the couch, and Claude narrated everything that had happened to him from the day he left Ireland to the present moment \u2014 every thing without reserve. Lady Rosalind marvelled much at all his strange experiences, seeming particularly interested about his residence in the sea-monster, for it bore out her theory of metempsychosis. He told her, too, how he had come to the Hall in the garb of a beggar. She forgave Claude for having drawn up the deed, and in her turn told him all that had happened at the Hall since he"], [229, "221 THE MURDERER. left ; of the witch's prognostication, which, even to the events of that night, had come true; of the dreadful murder, and her cousin's committal for the crime ; of Rembrandt's staying there as a traveller, under the name of Mr. Vyse, and of his conduct that night, part of which Claude had witnessed ; and of Dr. Holmes, who, she explained, was at present staying at the Hall, and would be surprised at the events which had passed that night. \" If this Doctor is still at the Hall,\" said Claude, \" I cannot make my appearance, excepting that he is one you know you can confide in, for if I am recognized as the forger who fled the country six years ago a worse fate may await me than banishment.\" \" Claude,\" answered his wife, \"you may rely on the Doctor ; I will see him first and tell him you are here, and what has passed.\" In the morning, shortly before breakfast-hour, Lady Rosalind, leaving Claude in the library, descended to the sitting-room, where she found the Doctor reading. The moment Dr. Holmes saw her he knew that some- thing disagreeable had occurred, for hers was one of those expressive faces whose features respond to the workings of the soul. He questioned her, and theu she told him all that had passed, and how her husband had saved her life. The Doctor was astonished to hear"], [230, "222 LADY ROSALIND. of her husband's existence, and, indeed, to hear that she was married at all. But Lady Rosalind explained all, telling the Doctor that she knew she could place trust in him not to let it be known that Claude was there. At this the Doctor expressed a strong desire to see Claude immediately. Lady Rosalind left the room to fetch her husband, and returned with him in a few moments. The Doctor was very much struck by -Claude's openness of manner, and by the nobility of his bear\" ing, and, notwithstanding that he could not quite fathom the peculiar intensity of Claude's black flash ing eyes, he rather liked him than otherwise. They talked matters over for some time, and finally the Doctor asked \u2014 \" What shall we do to get rid of this Rembrandt ? \" \" The law authorities, I think, had better be acquainted with the conduct of Rembrandt last night,\" said Claude. \" Let them have all the passages searched, and they will be sure to find the murderer. My presence here need not be made known to them. Meanwhile, the gentleman who is convicted for the crime could be set free, or, at least, let out on bail.\" \" Yes, that's best,\" remarked Lady Rosalind ; \" I will despatch the gardener \u2014 he's the most trustworthy person \u2014 to the constable at K \u2014 .\" All three agreed that this was the best course to"], [231, "223 THE MURDERER. take, and half-an-hour afterwards old Jean Tuppitt (who ere now had heard of what had occurred, and was glad to see Claude back again, although be had known him of old only as an esteemed visitor at the Hall) was driving rapidly along to fulfil Lady Rosalind's instruc tions. In due time the law officers arrived, bringing with them the news of Holzapfel's escape from prison, at which all were none the less rejoiced than surprised. The officers made, as they thought, an exhaustive search through the passages and cellars, but all to no purpose \u2014 Rembrandt could not be found. They stopped at the Hall for some time watching, but without avail ; at length they went away in the belief that the murderer must have made his escape, and with the purpose in view of sending out constables on his track. Little did they think that while they were searching assiduously for him in those pitchy passages he was there leering and grinning mockingly at them from out the sable shadows of the place. Although Holzapfel's sentence was now stayed, as was learned at De Fordyke Hall from headquarters, detectives were sent out after him to arrest him for having escaped from the prison, and from all accounts they were close upon him. Dr. Holmes every day grew more uneasy about Edith"], [232, "224 LADY\" ROSALIND. and about Marguerite, too, although, as regarded the latter, he tried to persuade himself that there was no reason to fear for her safety, iov she was always sensible and steady. But as to Edith ? Where could she have gone ? He could not think, and so he decided to journey back to the Rectory to see if Edith had gone there. He did not now mind leaving the Hall, for he knew that Lady Rosalind had protection. What better than that of her husband ? So he bade them farewell and left them alone at the Hall. Yes, they were alone \u2014 alone and happy ; for theirs was the deep, enduring love \u2014 strong as power itself."], [233, "CHAPTER XXVI. SHADOWED. To the man who is rilled with fear Trifles do ever large appear. Holzapfel and Edith sped on silently along dark, gloomy roads, hour after hour, mile after mile. There was not a soul stirring. The note of no bird was heard, no river murmured, even the wind withheld its most gentle breath. It seemed as though all nature slept, or had been summoned beneath the golden dome of heaven to rejoice in the triumphs of the Creator. All seemed at rest save these two weary souls. They had walked for six hours ere they came to any place where they could rest their tired limbs. It was close on seven o'clock in the morning when they sighted a little hamlet of some twenty or thirty small, white washed cottages. It was now daylight, and at one of the cottage doors a woman was leaning out, humming a doleful refrain. \" How far is it to L \u2014 ? \" asked Holzapfel of the woman. She had not seen them approach. Consequently she started at hearing the voice and ceased singing. <t"], [234, "226 LADY ROSALIND. \" It's a long distance, sir,\" she answered, after thinking a little. \" You're not going to walk there, sir ? \" \" Yes, we are,\" said Holzapfel, curtly. \"Then if ye are it'll take ye all yer time to do it be tween this and night, and ye look tired enough already.\" \" We are tired, but we must do it,\" returned Holzapfel. \" Come in and rest yerselves a while anyhow, and have a little bit o' something to eat. After breakfast my husband will be driving in the direction of L \u2014 ; he's goin' to a fair, and if yer not beyant sittin' beside him, I'm sure he will give you a lift.\" Holzapfel and Edith followed the woman into the cottage, thanking her for her kindness. She set down a comfortable meal before them, but they were too exhausted and too anxious to proceed on their journey to eat much. After the lapse of fifteen minutes or so a cart drove up to the door, a middle-aged, coarse-looking man holding the reins. He alighted, and asked his wife if the young lady and gentleman were ready, and, being answered in the affirmative, he proceeded to tidy the cart. This done the three got into the conveyance \u2014 the driver and Edith sitting upon a rough board seat, while Holzapfel lay down in the bottom. In a few minutes more they were rattling along the"], [235, "SHADOWED. 227 road; not very quickly, it must be confessed, but still moving. Holzapfel tried to fall asleep, but the jolting of the heavy cart prevented him from doing so. Indeed, he never experienced anything like it, and in a short time he felt his bones getting quite sore. They had gone along many roads, by many turnings in silence, when at last the carter pulled up at the junction of four roads, aud, pointing to one, said \u2014 \" That's your road, miss,\" speaking to Edith. Holzapfel. hearing the voice, sat up, and rubbing his eyes (he had been half asleep) asked \u2014 \" How far have we to go yet before reaching L \u2014 ? \" \" About six miles, sir,\" answered the driver, as they got down from the cart. Wilhelm handed him a small coin, at which he said, \" Thanky, sir,\" and drove away with a contented air. The travellers were somewhat rested by this time. They felt thankful to Providence for this help cm their journey, and now walked briskly on. Holzapfel was tilled with a dread of being appre hended ; and he felt sure that ere this his escape had become known, and that constables were even now on his track, and so they hurried on \u2014 on, lessening at every step the distance between them and the cave. At length they arrived, towards dusk, at a little village a few miles outside the town of L \u2014 . Here"], [236, "228 LADY ROSALIND. they did not know what to do or where to go. They should, however, get rest for the night, and, knowing that to linger about a small hamlet like this would attract notice, they knocked at the door of a one-storej house. Their knock was immediately answered by a middle-aged, low-sized woman, who peered into their faces in a suspicious manner. \" Could you accommodate two travellers for the night ?\" asked Holzapfel. \" Troth, I just can, yer honour; step inside, sir.' So saying she put her two hands up to her head and patted her white cap so as to make sure that it was in a proper, presentable position. She closed the door and ushered them into a back room, which was furnished as a bed and sitting-room. \"Would you be afther making yourselves at home,\" said the landlady, as she wiped her face with the end of a dirty apron, making her funny countenance still more laughable. \" Oh. I'm sure we shall be all right,\" returned Holzapfel, hardly able to suppress a laugh at the cut of the woman, and this notwithstanding that at the moment he was in anything but a laughing state of mind ; indeed, he was all the time trembling lest he might have been tracked by constables, who, per haps, were only waiting till morning to pounce upon him."], [237, "229 SHADOWED. \" But look here, my good woman, my sister here will want another room,\" added Holzapfel. \" Arrah, then, yer honour, I haven't got another one to spare.

I can make a shake down for her in the next room, where I sleep myself.\" \"Very good,\" said Holzapfel. \" Now, could you get us something to eat ? \" \" I've nothin' but a few praties and the remains of a pig's cheek.

He was worn and weary, and he had a presentiment over him that they were not safe in this house, and that the sooner they left it the better. Weighed down with gloomy prospects, and fatigued by the terrible brain strain of the past few days, he grew drowsier and drowsier, until he finally closed his eyes and fell into a state rather of semi-consciousness than of sleep. Reader, have you ever, weary with watching, and oppressed with anxiety, fallen into a state of nervous semi-slumber, from which the slightest noise or rustle made you start apprehensively ? Such was the condition of Wilhelm Holzapfel on this occasion. Suddenly he started up ! What was that shadow which had crossed the window before which he sat ? Even with his eyes closed he was positive that a dark shadow had glided by ! Who could it be ? His blood almost curdled in his veins as he thought \u2014 nay, as he felt sure \u2014 that he was being pursued. What would he do if he were again arrested ? He wished that Edith was back. It seemed to him hours since she went out, although it was but minutes ! He sat down again, and thinking now that the shadow was but the creation of his highly-strung nerves, he"], [239, "SHADOWED. 231 soon fell once more into his former drowsy state. Soon he was startled by the shadow again passing the window, and this time he was certain that it was no mere imagination. He went quickly to the window, just in time to see a tall, black figure receding hastily in the growing darkness. Edith now opened the door of the room and entered. Holzapfel was still looking out through the window, and did not hear the door open. \"What are you staring so intently at, Wilhelm ?\" inquired Edith, walking over to where he stood. \" Oh, Edith,\" he said, starting round, \" we must leave this place immediately. We are followed. I sat down to rest here at the window while you were away, and being drowsy closed my eyes, although I could not sleep. Twice a tall, black figure passed the window. At first I thought it was nervous imagination on my part, but on going to the window for the second time (just as you came in) I plainly saw a dark form glide away. What have you got, Edith ? Let us take the meal at once and fly hence. We must get to the cave to-night.\" \" Are you sure, Wilhelm, that you are not mis taken ? \" said Edith, who was now deadly pale. \"I could not be mistaken, Edith ; it is too true. At this juncture the landlady shoved open the door and shuffled in, carrying some food. She then laid"], [240, "232 LADY ROSALIND. the table-cloth, which done she was leaving the room, when Holzapfel called to her, saying \u2014 \" Landlady, I find that we cannot stop here to-night. I made a miscalculation in my time. I must be miles away from this by to-morrow morning. Pressure of business.\" The landlady turned round, stared, and opened her mouth in consternation. After a moment or so she seemed to grasp the idea, and said \u2014 \" Oh, very well, sir. I don't object, so long as you pay the night's lodging.\" \"You shall have that,\" returned Holzapfel. \" Come back in ten minutes or so ; we shall then be ready to start.\" \" Very good, sir,\" and she walked away, closing the door after her. The meal was hastily taken, the landlady summoned and paid, and Wilhelm and Edith, already suffering much from ennui and anxiety, were in a short time again hastening along dark, heavy-shaded roads. It would be wearisome indeed to follow the travellers along the many roads they had to walk. Suffice it to say that they were much affrighted by the passing of one or two vehicles, and that at length they could hear the moaning of the waves at no great distance \u2014 a welcome warning to Holzapfel that he was at last near the shore, within reach of his desired hiding-place."], [241, "233 SHADOWED. The cave was a good distance along the shore. It was a long time since Holzapfel was there, but he remembered that there were many secret chambers within the rocky cavern where he could safely hide. He remembered, too, that it would be impossible to get there on foot unless the tide had sunk to low level. Otherwise a boat should be hired, and there were ten chances to one that there were no boatmen about at that late hour. They walked on in the direction from whence the roar of the rolling waves proceeded. Had they by some subtle influence in Nature been able to see but a few hours ahead \u2014 able to look into the already flowering seeds of a near time, they would not hesitate to nip the flowers even in the bud \u2014 they would never have gone on !"], [242, "CHAPTER XXVII. A FATALITY. Envy and calumny, and hate and pain, And that unrest which men miscall delight, Can tonch her not, and torture not again. When they arrived at the seashore the tide was full im and they were thus prevented from going on foot to the cave. There was not a single boatman near. What were they to do ? Holzapfel was so full of horrible apprehension that he was determined at all hazards to reach the cave at once. If he lingered any longer, and was really being pursued, delay would prove fatal. He was for a time completely stunned \u2014 he knew not what to do or how to reach the desired place of con cealment. It was a pitch dark night, and a drizzling thick rain fell freely. There was no moon \u2014 she was down \u2014 and no sound could be heard, save the roll of the heavy sea. Holzapfel ran his eye, as well as he could in the gloom, along the shore, and presently he started, and said to Edith \u2014"], [243, "235 A FATALITY. \"Come this way. There's a canoe fastened to one of those rocks ; there is no time to lose \u2014 we must get into it, and paddle to the cave.\" So saying, he hurried towards the canoe, Edith fol lowing in silence. They crept cautiously towards the little skiff, fearing that there might be someone in it ; but soon they had ocular demonstration that it was unoccupied. The paddle lay at the bottom. They got in, and Holzapfel. who could skilfully manipulate the paddle, soon pushed from land, and in a few moments they were riding the billows, which heaved so mercilessly that they were in imminent danger of being precipitated into a watery grave. Far better, perhaps, would it have been if they were then drowned \u2014 thus ending for ever their mortal strife. Edith thought strongly of throwing herself in, but a little reflection on what might follow stayed her from such an act. Would she, self -murdered, reach the Vale of Eternal Felicity ? Ah ! there was the great question. She could not say she would : for between her and the life beyond there was drawn a dark, impenetrable veil \u2014 a veil thicker than human loom can weave ! Thus, and this way only, was she prevented."], [244, "236 LADY ROSALIND. But now she was aroused from her reverie by the inordinate lurching of the craft, which had become all but uncontrollable. She was obliged to hold on to her seat like grim death, else she would be heaved out. They were now near the rocky cavern, and Holzapfel, by dint of great exertion, headed the canoe towards its mouth. The mighty waves fell with crash terrific upon the adjacent cliffs \u2014 far iu the cavern they groaned and wailed, almost in human manner \u2014 while the winds shrieked and whistled, and the curlews screeched ominously, making the night more dreadful still. With great difficulty, Holzapfel brought the canoe into the centre of the black, dismal cave. On each side there was a narrow ledge of rock, just wide enough to walk along. Holzapfel and Edith succeeded, after much trouble, in getting out of the skiff on to one of these ledges, where they made up their minds to stop till the tide abated, which would probably be daylight, and they could then get further away from the place, where Holzapfel was sure he had been watched. Their nerves were already completely unstrung. but now a new horror seized them, causing a tingling sensation to thrill them through and their blood almost to freeze within their veins ! They perceived that the waterwas rising higher and higher \u2014 every minute there was a perceptible heightening of the water level !"], [245, "237 A FATALITY. Where and when would it stop ? Not perhaps until they were drowned. Neither of them could swim, and even if they could they would never reach shore in that heavy sea. The waves roared on, and their confusion grew greater. How could they save themselves ? The boat ! No ; for when they groped for it in the dense dark ness it was nowhere to be found \u2014 it had broken from where Holzapfel had fastened it ! Still the water rose almost by inches, and now it covered them to their knees. They tried to scramble higher, but there was no footing of any kind in the rocks. They walked along the ledge to the mouth of the cave, but could go no further. Then they turned and walked inwards into the black recesses of the cavern, but the farther they went the deeper they were in water. Finding no means of escape, they leaned back against the rocks, holding one another by the hand, and with a prayer to heaven for mercy for the sins of their lives, they awaited their dreadful fate. They uttered not a word, but, as the waters still flowed in, despair was in their fixed gaze. On came the waters with hideous din, a din which in the ears of the victims seemed like their death-knell ! Thev were now covered almost to their shoulders."], [246, "238 LADY ROSALIND. and ever and anon the waves dashed over their heads. Convulsively they grasped each other's hand \u2014 in a very few moments they knew they would be no more! But, lo ! the waters now fell and seemed to ebb all as quickly as they had flown. Hope came again to the wanderers \u2014 they might perhaps escape. Little by little the waters fell and receded, and after three or four hours of anxious watching the flood had abated sufficiently to allow Holzapfel and Edith to quit the cave by journeying along the shore. But it was still dark. They waited, wet and cold, and in a short time the grey dawn commenced to break through the clouds. They ventured, in the half-light, from their hiding-place, in the hope that their pursuers would have by this time abandoned their pursuit ; but \u2014 oh, terror ! \u2014 they had hardly walked a perch when, looming before them in the darkness, at about twenty yards' distance, they saw the selfsame tall, black figure which had been the cause of all Holzapfel's horrible apprehensions and fears \u2014 the figure that he had seen cross him as he dozed by the window in the house in the country village ! A constable, thought Holzapfel ! And perhaps hiding behind the rocks he had his men in readiness to hurry the runaway back to that cold prison cell from which he had so recently escaped. He reflected for a moment, looked dejectedly for an instant at Edith, and as the"], [247, "239 A FATALITY. form advanced towards them, in his desperation, with out more ado he drew his pistol \u2014 that same pistol which he had discharged at the process-server at the Rectory \u2014 and fired at the figure before him. He then expected to see three or four men rush out from behind the neighbouring rocks, and he was prepared to tire at them all ; but no one came. The figure staggered for a moment or two and then fell heavily on the sandy beach, and as it did so a feminine groan went up and rent the air with its harshness. A woman ! Oh, heaven ! Who could it be ? Holzapfel advanced instantly, lifted up the body and turned up the face, and when he did so a pair of black eyes glared at him with the glassy gaze of death, and the lips moved as if their owner tried to speak. But now the eyes closed \u2014 closed for ever. \" Oh, God ! what have I done ?\" exclaimed Holzapfel in tones of despair, as he recognized the features and form of Marguerite Holmes \u2014 dead before him, and killed by his hand. But now Edith, for the first time, saw that the dead form was that of her sister. She uttered a wild cry, looked distractedly at the form on the ground, and then looking fixedly, with a gaze of agonized terror at Holzapfel, she said \u2014 \" Wilhelm, why did you do this ? I loved you, but 1 loved her more. Farewell ! \" Holzapfel was confounded. He was about to address"], [248, "240 LADY ROSALIND. Edith, but on looking up he was startled to find that she had really disappeared ! There he was alone with the corpse \u2014 he did not know what to do with it. His heart ached, his brain swam round. Was it only a dream, or was it a grim reality ? Alas ! it was all too true. Edith was gone, and Marguerite was dead at his feet ! Edith gone ! He was beginning to love her for the self-sacrificing love she had shown towards him ; and now, at this moment deserted by her, he felt himself the most miserable man in the world. Let us go back a little (how many of us would wish to do so, even a little ?) and see how it was that Marguerite came to be there. Although apparently cold and hard, Marguerite was capable of the deepest and holiest affection. She loved Edith with a burning love, and when, after the lapse of some considerable time, neither her uncle nor sister returned to the Rectory she set out to follow and watch with motherly solicitude the movements of the latter. She did not know to what part of Ireland she should direct her steps, but, by accident, she happened to pass through the town in which Holzapfel was imprisoned, and there she saw Edith hurrying to the prison to visit her lover. From that day she watched and"], [249, "241 A FATALITY. followed them everywhere they went. She witnessed Holzapfel's escape from incarceration ; it was her figure that f lightened him as she glided past the window where he slumbered. And now mark the reward of her anxiety for her sister's safety. Cut off in the bloom of youth, and sent before the judgment throne of God UnhousePd, disappointed, unauel'd ! Holzapfel, after a few moments' pause (thinking of what the result of being seen in such a dreadful position might be), gently lifted up the body, and re traced his steps with all possible haste to the cave. He went in as far as he could until stopped by the water. Then he mounted one of the side ledges, and walked with difficulty further and further into the black recesses of the cavern. He stopped, and after holding the body in space for a couple of seconds at arms' length he let it go. He shuddered with horror as he heard it splash heavily in the water at a tremendous distance beneath. Silence soon again reigned supreme. And now he turned to grope his way out of the cavern, but in his confusion he forgot which way to go. He walked on a\"'ain slowly and cautiously, little thinking, however, that he was going further and further into the cave at every step, instead of coming out ! Shortly he began to think that he had gone rather R"], [250, "242 LADY ROSALIND. far without reaching the mouth of the cavern. He halted again, turned, and then put out his foot to pro ceed, but he lost his footing and fell headlong over the side of the precipice. Instantly he felt as if he had banged against something. It was a projecting rock, which had struck him in the forehead, and in which his coat had now caught, arresting him in his fall. The blood was fast issuing from his head, and were it not that he had liberty to take out his kerchief and tie it around the wound he would probably have bled to death. The clear light of day had not yet pierced into that gloomy abyss, and in the grey shadows of the place Holzapfel thought he saw those dark glassy eyes of Marguerite peering at him through the gloom. He thought, too, that he could hear her laughing, a mock ing laugh \u2014 taunting him in his misery. In this perilous position he hung for hours. Daylight at length, to some extent, broke in (perhaps as much as it ever did in that gloomy place), and Holzapfel succeeded in disentangling himself and making his way up the side of the rocky precipice. After much danger he reached the top, and proceeded to walk cautiously along the cliffs towards the entrance of the cave. He was by no means in a condition to travel, but in the disguise which he had adopted he thought, now that"], [251, "243 A FATALITY. the night was past, and that he was so far from the prison, he could leave the cave in comparative safety. He was anxious, too, to find Edith ; but which way to go he knew not. Having revolved matters in his mind, he resolved to make his way, as best he could, back to the Rectory. and there he would try to find out how things were progressing, and more especially he would see if Edith had gone there. So, at an early hour, he set out secretly with this destination in view."], [252, "CHAPTER XXVIII A MIDNIGHT VISITOR. When drowsiness hath locked up mortal sense. Claude and Lady Rosalind were living in complete happiness at the Hall, undisturbed by outward in fluences. But this (alas ! that earthly happiness should always fleet so fast, and sorrow ever stay) did not last long. After a month had passed by it became known that silver plate, ornaments, and food were nightly dis appearing from the dining-room. This caused much anxiety at the Hall, and after a little time the pilfer ing became so patent that Claude resolved to stay up some night to watch and catch the burglar, and to visit him with the punishment which such an act deserved. He well knew that the immediate neighbourhood of the Hall abounded in highwaymen, and that house breakers, too, were not scarce. Nevertheless, he could not understand how they could get into the Hall, for it was always well barred and bolted, and few, if any, outsiders knew of the secret passages. Besides, even if they could get"], [253, "245 A MIDNIGHT VISITOR. into the passages they would require to know the place thoroughly before they could make their way to any of the rooms. If they did not know the place they would have enough to do to grope about without breaking their necks on some of the old loose steps, or falling into one of the pitfalls, which were numerous in the passages. It was ten o'clock on a bright, moonlight night, when Claude and Rosalind were sitting in one of the upper apartments of the Hall. Lady Rosalind was reading, in silvery tones, some of the soliloquies from \" Hamlet,\" while Claude listened attentively thereto. \" Do you think, Claude,\" she asked, breaking off, \" that Shakespeare really intended Hamlet for a mad man ? \" \"No, Rosalind,\" answered Claude, \"I don't believe Hamlet was intended to be mad. In Hamlet Shakes peare presents a character who for his own purpose feigns madness. Shakespeare tells us that Hamlet is not mad, and in face of this critics come forward and tell us that he is mad \u2014 that Shakespeare made a mis take, that Shakespeare lied. By-the-bye, Rosalind, I want to go down to the library to look up something. I'll not be long.\" Claude, on the pretence of going to read for a while in the library, left the room \u2014 closing the door after him \u2014 and descended to the front parlour, where he"], [254, "246 LADY\" ROSALIND. determined to wait and see who it was that nightly stole into that apartment and took away silver plate, eatables, wine, and other things that lay at hand and were easily removable. After pacing the room for a short time he drew a chair close to the heavy-mullioned window, sat down, and in a moment he was lost to the world in deep cogitation. It was a g-lorious night ; the pale, silvery beams of the moon shone through the window and fell upon Claude's haggard, mystic face, whose paleness was made still paler by the profusion of raven curls that hung on each side. His garments were likewise black, and by his side was hung a glistening rapier, the hilt of which he held fast in his right hand. He fixed a contemplative gaze on the luminous moon, and as he did so he bethought of that night in the African hut when he called up \u2014 or rather down \u2014 the spirit of his wife's father from some such body as that. He thought, too, of the thousands of human souls that dwelt in shapes innumerable in all the planets, and of those who inhabited forms in the depths of the sea \u2014 forms such as that which he himself had dwelt in. He thought with horror of the many transitions which his own spirit might be doomed to make before reaching eternal bliss. And then his mind wandered back to things more earthly. He thought of recent"], [255, "247 A MIDNIGHT VISITOR. investigations he had been making regarding man's astral being, of the doctrines of the Rosicrucians, Pythagoras, and the like. He had many strange theories regarding man and man's hereafter. He held that reincarnation and transmigration are essential to human evolution ; that what is ordinarily known as intuition is not intuition, but that it is the memory of knowledge acquired in a former exis tence or existences, and that man, after a series of transitions, becomes more and more intelligent, until he at length becomes omniscient \u2014 the point of omnis cience, however, not being reached until he has passed through many transitions and changes of form, not alone in this world, but in others \u2014 the sun, moon, stars, and planets. To the second of these theories he attributed the fact that some men are much more stupid than others, and the latter theory was sustained by the revelations of the spirit in the African hut. He had many more theories which he was revolving in his mind. He was just thinking that the somnam bulistic faculties of mankind could be developed to such an extent as to stifle the faculties of sense, and to make man an altogether superior being to what he at present is, when suddenly he started ! An idea which never before struck him had just dawned upon his imagination \u2014 it was in connection with the astral"], [256, "248 LADY ROSALIND. body ! Was not that astral body capable of existence separate and apart from the material body ? He con cluded immediately that it was. Could it not by will power be made to separate itself from the flesh body and move about independently of it ? From that moment he determined to use every effort within his power to reduce this new theory to a practical possibility. Who would he practise upon ? He woidd not do so with the Lady Rosalind, and as for himself, he was not quite sure that the body he dwelt in at that moment was not his astral counterpart and not his body. \" For how,\" he thought, \" could his flesh body, having been digested by the fish, assume its original shape and substance again ? \" Thus ran his ideas, when he was startled slightly by a rustling in the tapestry, the sliding of a panel in the far wall, and then the appearance of a figure, with white face and black clothes. Claude withdrew from the window into a dark corner, drew his rapier, and waited to see what the figure would do, and above all, who it was. The moonbeams fell full upon the new-comer, and then he discerned, as, indeed, he had expected, that the thief was none other than Jacques Rembrandt seeking for food. Claude stood silent while Rembrandt went to the oaken sideboard, opened it with a key of his"], [257, "A MIDNIGHT VISITOR. 249 own, and took out bread, butter, and wine, and pro ceeded to feast thereon heartily. \" Humph!\" he exclaimed, as he quaffed a vessel of Rhenish, \" here I am in their very parlour, eating and drinking; under their very noses, and they can't lay hands on me. They won't either, with all their smart ness. It's a wonder they don't miss the victuals, and watch for the burglar. Ha! ha!\" he laughed, as he drew a chair to the cupboard, and made himself comfortable, \" the burglar is too smart for them ! If the same burglar doesn't murder a few more of them they're all right. I think I'll do it too. Only a few more souls sent to damnation \u2014 a few more throats cut, that's all. I'll do that, and then I'll have the place to myself. I can laugh at the authorities ; they'd never find me in these passages. ' J'y suis et j'y resterai,' as a countryman of mine once said.\" Claude advanced with his rapier, and called out \u2014 \u25a0 \" Villain ! murderer ! So tis you who have been persecuting us like this.\" Rembrandt did not utter a syllable, but rushed through the opening in the wall, followed quickly by Claude, who had first procured a lighted lantern. Claude descended a flight of narrow, broken stone stairs, and then he heard Rembrandt's footfalls as he beat a hasty retreat along the dark passages. Claude quickened his pace, and arriving at the end of"], [258, "250 LADY ROSALIND. a passage he descended another flight of stairs. He stood a moment and listened. He heard the footsteps again, then the bang of a heavy iron door, followed by a dead silence. He crept cautiously on once more, holding out the light before him and peering ahead. In a few moments he came to the musty, damp chamber which he had entered on the evening he had come in disguise to the Hall. He passed through the half-open door and flashed his lantern around the cellar. There was no one there, and Claude stole to the door of the second chamber. There was the murderer crouching in a far corner with a dagger in one hand and a pistol in the other, while his eyes flashed and rolled in a fiendish manner. Claude had barely espied Rembrandt when the latter sprang at him like a tiger, snatched the lantern from him and extinguished it. Then Rembrandt uttered a wild, hollow laugh, which rang hideously through the cold chamber, causing Claude to shiver with dread. \" Now I have you. You'll never leave this alive,\" exclaimed Rembrandt, triumphantly, as he raised his dagger above Claude's head. Claude did not utter a word, but glided around the walls to the opposite side of the cellar. His would-be murderer did not follow, but, seeming"], [259, "A MIDNIGHT VISITOR. 251 to know in what part of the chamber Claude was located, he leaned against the wall, levelled his pistol straight before him and fired. The shot had no effect. By its instantaneous glare Claude caught a glimpse of Rembrandt's face, and never in his life before had he seen such a devilish expression on the countenance of mortal. Rembrandt, too, must have seen Claude, for immediately after firing he sprang- across the apartment towards his victim, but Claude slipped breathlessly along the wall and avoided him. And now there was a dreadful silence, during which Claude heard nothing but the wild beating of his own heart and that of Rembrandt. He waited, and the throbbing came closer. Rem brandt knocked against Claude, hissing a fearful oath as he did so. He made a lunge at Claude with his dagger, and in the twinkling of an eye they were both in the centre of the chamber engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter. They fought ferociously for several minutes, after which the deadly combat terminated by Rembrandt's falling with an agonized groan to the ground \u2014 Claude had pierced him through the heart with his rapier. Another groan followed, and Claude bent down over his antagonist to see if he were dead. He felt the pulse ; it did not beat, neither did the heart. The limbs were stiff and grew perceptibly colder and colder."], [260, "252 LADY ROSALIND. Claude concluded that life was extinct, and now groped his way out of the place. He hurried along the dark passages and up the various flights of stairs until he reached the dining room or parlour. Here he waited a moment in order to secure the panel in the wall through which Rem brandt had been coming, and then he hastened upstairs to the apartment in which he had left Lady Rosalind. She was still reading Shakespeare, but, on looking up, she seemed surprised at Claude's appearance, for she at once exclaimed \u2014 \" Are you ill, Claude ? ' Claude was very much agitated, and, struggling hard to control himself, he answered \u2014 \" No, Rosalind, I am not ill \u2014 - at least not decidedly ill \u2014 but I don't think this place agrees with me, nor do I think it agrees with you either. What would you say to leaving it for a few months ? The change would be beneficial to us both.\" \" I would like a change, too, Claude \u2014 just for a little while. There is one of the villas on our Yorkshire property untenanted at present. Couldn't we go there for a while ? We could leave the Hall in charge of old Jean.\" \" Yes, yes, Rosalind, that would do admirably \u2014 admirably ! \" said Claude, dreamily. \" When can we go ? When would you be ready to start ? \""], [261, "253 A MIDNIGHT VISITOR. \" I can go any time you wish, Claude,\" replied Lady Rosalind. \" Very well, Rosalind ; we will make arrangements immediately.\" Arrangements were made, but it was found, consider ing all things, that they could not conveniently leave the Hall for at least a week. During this short period Claude was very much perturbed by reason of his seeing, or imagining he saw, Rembrandt's spirit stalking about in every dark corner and recess of the Hall, gibbering and leering at him defiantly. So it was that Claude felt the time hang heavily \u2014 creep at snail pace until the end of that terrible week arrived."], [262, "CHAPTER XXIX. A SOJOURN IN* YORKSHIRE. Haunts of wood-gods. Jean Tuppitt was much surprised on hearing the intentions of his master and mistress. He was un eertain at first whether he should quietly agree to being left in charge of the Hall, or whether he would ask to be allowed to accompany Lady Rosalind to Yorkshire. Having known her ladyship from her childhood, the old gardener was very much attached to her, and would feel very much being left behind. Besides, he thought to himself that if they did go to Yorkshire they would in all probability stay longer than a few months if they liked the place. On the other hand, Jean did not feel at all inclined to leave the Hall, even for a short time. He loved every stick and stone in and about it. Every walk through the demesne recalled some fond memory of his old master \u2014 every place had some souvenir for him. He wavered long, uncertain what to do ; but finally he determined to stay at the Hall, according toinstruc-"], [263, "255 A SOJOURN IN YORKSHIRE. tions, and not to say anything about being brought to Yorkshire. Indeed, he had a feeling over him that if he once left the Hall he would have good reason to mourn his departure, even as did old Adam \u2014 Years till now, almost fourscore, Here lived I, but now live here no more. Howbeit he stayed, and Claude and Rosalind set out for Yorkshire, taking with them one female servant. The house they were going to was situated near that beautiful and romantic spot known as Nidderdale. It constituted part of the De Fordyke property, and at this time the house was being let furnished. It had just been vacated, and this afforded a good opportunity to Claude and his wife of taking a holiday away from the Hall. Vine Lodge was picturesquely situated in a vale between towering hills, half-way up a mountainous acclivity. Springing and rushing hard by was a clear, crystal brook, ever shimmering in the various lights \u2014 uow leaping amid large boulders, now throwing about a silvery spray or dancing joyously in the golden sun light. All about the Lodge was thickly wooded. Here and there were groves and walks studded with beauteous trees, whose spreading branches formed many a rustic bower. Stretching up to \"insuperable heights of loftiest"], [264, "256 LADY ROSALIND. shade \" were ancient oaks and poplars, whose sad and solemn silence might well inspire the belief that even they were lamenting the loss of some sad soul who was wont in times gone by to pace beneath their darkling shades. Here, too, the thrush twittered in peace in the dark, green shadows beneath the trees, or being disturbed by the sound of some human foot, it started up and winged its flight to some unknown retreat. Far beneath the Lodge, joined by many a rushing stream, the river Nidd flowed gently on, murmuring softly, with a ceaseless murmur, recalling the words of the poet \u2014 Men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. Standing by the river-side a solitary stork might here and there be seen, seeming to brood or think as it gazed into the water below. High up in the valley an occasional stream was lost to view as it rushed and gurgled beneath some rocky cavern and splashed un seen, lost in gruesome passages sometimes for a stretch of two or three miles at a time, and then seeming to have gained vigour and force on its dark, unwatched journey, it burst forth crystal-like, and rushed down with accelerated speed to join the river. Some of these caverns had never been explored, nor could they be, without guides and torches ; and even"], [265, "A SOJOURN' IN YORKSHIRE. 257 then the attendant dangers had always prevented a thorough investigation of these places, with which there were many terrible stories associated. Some, indeed, went so far as to say that there was no opening at the end of many of these long, black caves, and that they were haunted with the spirits of the departed. Some persons who went on expeditions through the caverns were lost, and their bodies not having been found, it was said they were carried away alive by demons wdio inhabited the inmost recesses of these un canny abodes. Vine Lodge was an ancient two-storey building, clad in a mantle of thick ivy, and overshadowed by many tall trees. A large rustic porch shaded the entrance, and the upper windows having balconies, a very good view could be had of the surrounding scenery \u2014 the stately cloud-capped hills above, and the river stretch ing away beneath, lying like a huge strip of burnished silver between the meadows of the dale. Claude and Lady Rosalind were glad of the change to such a quiet, unfrequented place as this, for although De Fordyke Hall was lonely and quiet enough, yet the hideous associations which were of late connected therewith, made it anything at all but an agreeable habitation for either of them. Time, which waiteth for no man, sped quickly on. s"], [266, "258 LADY ROSALIND. and Claude and his wife grew more and more to like their new abode. Claude, being somewhat of a naturalist, was much pleased and pleasantly occupied pursuing and follow ing up the many opportunities which the dales pre eminently afforded for study in this direction. Lady Rosalind, for her part, spent much of her time in exploring the caves and watery caverns of the dis trict. Her natural curiosity and anxiety to penetrate into the regions of mystery evidenced their existence \u2014 though latent they might have been \u2014 even in this matter. She often went by herself (carrying a small lantern to light her on her way) through parts of the caverns in question, into which no one had dared to venture within the memory of man. We mortals are all of us restless, unsatisfied beings, and Claude was no exception. He soon got weary of naturalistic research, and from time to time he lapsed into the contemplation of those theories which he held regarding man's astral or spiritual self, with what result let events reveal."], [267, "CHAPTER XXX. THE ABODE OF PROBATION. Idleness is the devil's snare for small or great. Lady Rosalind was happy until, alas ! encouraged by the quiet and silence of her surroundings, she again commenced to think and brood over the future. She was one day making her way, by the aid of a lantern, through one of the neighbouring caverns, when suddenly, as if prompted by some unknown power, her thoughts involuntarily turned on the witch and the cave, in which her fortune and many events which had already come to pass had been forewarned and shadowed forth. The murder was foreshadowed. as was also the scene between Rembrandt and herself ; for did she not see a lifeless form lying across her favourite walk, and did she not see a strange man bending over her own form and holding a knife in his uplifted hand ? Did not the witch's words, too, come true ? \"Young as thou art, and much sadness as thou hast seen, much more sadness wilt thou see.\""], [268, "260 LADY ROSALIND. Those words rang even now in her ladyship's ears and were they not true ? \" One there is who would harm thee. Beware of him \u2014 beware ! \" How true ! How prophetic ! Lady Rosalind revolved all these things in her mind as she made her way through the dark, unwholesome cavern. And then she bethought of the fact that she had swooned way before the witch had completed her pro phecy. She wished that this had not been the case, for she felt now more than ever a burning desire to know all. How could she say that there were not more horrors and miseries yet in store for her? She knew not ! How could she find out ? Was there any possibility of communicating with Ilackado ? There might be. What if there was ? And then she thought, would she not be better without knowing what was in the future? If there were troubles ahead would she not be far happier being ignorant of them? She certainly would. Still Lady Rosalind stepped from rock to rock further and further into the blackness, her small lantern casting a pale, sickly hue around, while the rushing waters kept up a perpetual deafening din. She must now have been at least a mile and a half within the cave, but so wrapped was she in contempla-"], [269, "261 THE ABODE OF PROBATION. tion that she seemed to have forgotten where she was, and whither she went. Presently she commenced mutteriug to herself, from time to time reiterating the name of the spirit Ilackado. Now, holding up her light, she looked before her in the darkness, and there she saw, standing in a recess in the rocks, as if waiting for her, the spirit whose name she had just repeated. She did not seem frightened at beholding him. Immediately on her approach Ilackado bowed and advanced, grinning broadly as he did so. \" You desire to speak to me, lady,\" he said, bowing obsequiously. \" I did not call you,\" answered Lady Rosalind ; \"but I am just as glad that you have come.\" \" You may not have called,\" said the spirit, \" but you repeated my name. I could hear you even where I was, leagues from earth. But never mind that \u2014 your will ? \" \" You may remember,\" proceeded her ladyship, slowly, \" the last time I was in the witch's cave I failed to hear the latter part of the witch's prognosti cations by reason of my having fainted.\" Ilackado chuckled confirmation. \" Well, then,\" she continued, \" I am anxious to hear what the end of the prophecy was. Can you tell me ? \""], [270, "262 LADY ROSALIND. \" I cannot ; but she can. Wilt thou hear it from her ? \" \" I will,\" answered Lady Rosalind. \" Lead on Ilackado beckoned and walked forward, the other following. They had walked some considerable distance when the spirit turned round and told Lady Rosalind to lay down the lantern on a rock close by where they stood. This being done, Ilackado caught the lady firmly round the waist, and having lifted her from her feet, he carried her speedily downwards. Lady Rosalind did not now feel that dread with which she had been seized on the other occasion when the spirit carried her thus through space. Furthermore, she did not see those sights and spectres which caused her so much fear when she was being hurried through the passages of De Fordyke Hall. At length Ilackado stopped and set down his burden in the witch's cave just in front of the caldron, around which the hag was stalking wildly.* At first the witch (looking older, and, if possible, more hideous than before) seemed not to know that there was anyone with her in her hellish abode.

Seem ing to have finished her unholy function, she ceased to walk and mutter, and, stirring round the mystic con tents of the pot, she glanced fiercely at Lady Rosalind. Ilackado did not disappear as he had done on the former occasion. \"Pray complete my fortune,\" said Lady Rosalind, in answer to the fiery, inquiring look of the witch. \" I told it thee before,\" hissed the hag. \" I must not tell thee again ; I am forbidden to do so. But I'll call my masters. They will inform thee.\" So saying the witch again \"performed her antic round,\" stopped, pointed into the darkness, and cried out in hoarse, shrill voice \u2014 \" Look ! lady, look ! \" Lady Rosalind turned her eyes from the witch to the darkness, but she saw nothing. The witch looked long and fiercely into the gloom, still pointing with her wand, and then, seeming perplexed, her face changed from fierceness into a look of unutterable anger. She hissed and mumbled to herself, strode round the pot again, and again stood and pointed into the gloom. But nothing appeared. And then she stooped over the caldron and said, in her shrill, unnatural tones \u2014 \" The powers will not answer me. For ever blasted be the souls that work thus in their might against me ! \""], [272, "264 LADY ROSALIND These words were uttered with a hollow, mocking ring, combined with a tone of deep anguish and anger. She continued \u2014 \" Years have I served you in this place, ye powers, and now ye will not attend to my supplications. For ever accursed be the spirits overruling thus your wonted goodness ! Can ye not be persuaded, oh ! my masters ? Will ye not reflect as I do ask ye ? \" This latter sentence was spoken mildly, almost im ploringly ; and, after a slight pause, the witch assumed anger again, and proceeded \u2014 \" The time will come, the time will come, when ye shall cease for ever to mock me. Beware what ye do, ye powers ! My time for revenge will come \u2014 'tis coming ! Abandon those beseeching souls that come between us ! For ever blasted be their future ! \" Here the witch stopped and was silent. Looking at Ilackado steadfastly, she said \u2014 \" My masters will not answer ; they're out of humour now. Bring her to the higher powers. I can do no more.\" At this Ilackado again clutched Lady Rosalind and sped away, whither she knew not. She felt herself sailing, suspended, in unbounded space, while hot winds whistled by, seeming to laugh at her distress, and causing her hair to wave back and her black garments to flap and flutter. They soon emerged from darkness into the light of day, and as they arose Lady Rosalind"], [273, "THE ABODE OF PROBATION. 265 heard the music of the birds and the simpering strains of the harp resound upon the air. Still the spirit sped on, and now she heard and saw the ocean roll beneath her. Cities she saw, and the glittering spires of churches, the golden domes of palaces, stretches of green sward and meadow land, cloud-capped mountains, and hillsides where grew stately trees, and forests of woody wealth. All these she saw. Still the spirit sped through air and space, and soon these things dwindled to nothingness in the distance. The murmur of life from cities below fainted away, and soon the earth itself, whizzing like a ball in space, was lost to sight, and other orbs were seen rolling \u2014 rolling, ever restless. Yet on went Ilackado with his burden, and darkness now prevailed \u2014 a sullen, solemn darkness. The spirit urged his pace \u2014 on, on, further aud further into the regions of Night and Gloom, and through the unsearch able kingdom of Erebus. Ilackado at length came to a stop, and, standing, he set down Lady Rosalind upon the overhanging cliffs of the Abode of Probation. Yes, the Abode of Probation ! there where lives the ethereal counterpart \u2014 the astral \u2014 of each one of us that is born into this dreary, weary world.

For every pang suffered by our astral in the Abode of Probation is felt by us here \u2014 reflected by a spiritual reflection. So will it always be ! No light of day ever pierced into this dread abode : but all was one moonless night. Lady Rosalind looked down beneath the gaping cliffs on whose summit she stood \u2014 down into rueful depths, into a roaring gulf, and there she saw undying Phlege thon waves surging wildly, and now and then arising and throwing about a fiery, f\u0153tid, deleterious spray. Human blood, too, she saw upthrown, clinging to the cavernous sides and dripping back into the depths below. She heard the baleful billows heave and lash against the precipice's rocky sides. She heard now the murmur, now the wail of voices reverberate again and again. But, shriller in accent than all else, she heard the voices of the gods, and Agony, and Fate, and Time interrogate and answer back from darkness to darkness. Stretching forward over the yawning abyss, her gar ments flapped in a hurricane of flame, and the sul phurous elements threatened at every moment to upraise and swallow her in their secret, pitchy depths ; and then she saw, down between each mighty wave, a"], [275, "THE ABODE OF PROBATION. 267 human being (or rather an astral), covered with en tangled weeds, and seeming in throes of pain. Dark it was, yet there was light enough that each might see his brother's misery. Ilackado, grasping Lady Rosalind firmly, led her a little distance along the cliffs, and, pointing down into the hideous gloom, he exclaimed \u2014 \"Now will I show thee all. Behold ! Look into the future as thou wouldst ! \" Lady Rosalind looked down, and there, beneath her in those horrid depths, she saw, in a dark cluster, the astrals of many whom she had known on earth, prominent among whom was her father. She was horrified to see him there, more particularly as he seemed to be in pain. Still she glanced at him, and now he looked from out his fiery prison up to where his daughter stood. There was a piteous, troubled expression upon his countenance. He seemed to recognize her, but did not speak. As Lady Rosalind bent over she accidentally displayed to his view the ring which Ilackado had given her, whereupon he gesticulated wildly, and called out \" The ring ! \" His voice echoed in a hollow, unnatural manner up the cliffs, and when its sound had died away he seemed to struggle and writhe in the dark flames. Her lady-"], [276, "268 LADY ROSALIND. ship seemed pinned to the spot as she watched him struggling below ; and now, by dint of great exertion, he threw himself upon an uplifting wave, which bore him upwards to the top of the cliffs, quite close to Lady Rosalind. \"My daughter! my daughter!\" exclaimed the astral. \" give me that accursed ring. Take it from thy finger, and throw it into these depths. It harmed me ; I would not have it injure thee.\" The astral sank back upon the black wave as it receded into darkness below and altogether disappeared from view. Lady Rosalind was about taking her father's advice as to the ring, when, turning towards Ilackado, she saw that he was leering strangely at her. \" Do as thou wilt, lady,\" he said, tauntingly. \" Never mind me. Throw away the charm ! \" \" What will the consequence be ? \" she asked. She felt sure that her father had counselled her lightly, and she was willing to carry out his advice at considerable cost, if necessary. \" Thou canst not call me more,\" answered Ilackado. \" Of that I do not care, provided that you do lead me safely back to Yorkshire.\" \" Then I will do that; but thou hast not seen all. Throw in the ring, then I'll show the rest.\" Lady Rosalind did as she was desired, and the spirit led her on further."], [277, "THE ABODE OF PROBATION. 269 He stopped again in a few moments and pointed into another recess, wherein Lady Rosalind was surprised at beholding her own and her husband's astrals. She had hardly caught sight of them when a huge, dark wave passed over, rolling them into the bosom of the hidden abyss. \"Now thou hast seen all,\" said Ilackado; \"but in order that thou mayest understand what thou hast seen we must visit the sages. We must hasten, for my time is well-nigh outstayed already.\" Ilackado hurried on, followed by Lady Rosalind, and as they proceeded, the surging, foaming billows beneath grew more quiet; and now they were calm and placid, and down, reclining upon the dark, stagnant surface, were seen many long--deceased celebrities of the world. In one remote recess were stretched the astrals of Julius C\u00e6sar, Cicero, and Plato. Ilackado halted, and called out \u2014 \" Speak to her. Speak ! Explain At this Plato upstretched his right hand, and point ing at Lady Rosalind, spoke in solemn tones as follows : \u2014 \" When I was on your earth I did say and write.

And this, notwithstand ing that our souls may move from body to body, from world to world for countless ages.

This astral \u2014 undying \u2014 is a thing that shall rise and join the soul ; aye, I tell thee, and tell thee truly, that humanity is the chiefest and paramount of all the abodes of the soul, and being so, the Gods have ordained that the human form is the one pre-eminently suitable for unity with the soul. Thus it is their ordinance, when lodging each soul in its human body, to create an immortal counterpart of that body, wherein the soul (having subsequently passed from owl to fish, from stag to eagle, from rat to oak, and other transitions, mayhap for years innumer able) may dwell for eternity in the palace of endless, ineffable joy. And this abode \u2014 O, mark ! \u2014 is a place wherein to purify.

I'm sum moned away.\" As Ilackado thus spoke he took Lady Rosalind in his arms, more gently than before, and took flight again for earth. It was not long before Lady Rosalind found herself alone, in a rather dazed condition, at a convenient distance from Vine Lodge. When she entered the house she was greeted by Claude, who questioned her as to her day's discoveries \u2014she had been so unusually long away. She answered him as evasively as possible, without being abrupt or snappish, telling him many things of interest about the watery caves, but nothing more. She pondered much, during the next few days, upon the strange things she had seen and heard, but she was puzzled to know what connection there could be between what she had seen and her earthly future. Even that there was such a thing as an astral or second self, as she had been shown and told there was, what had that to do with things mundane ? She could not now see what it all meant, but know ledge in such matters came perhaps too soon . Far better had it never come !"], [280, "CHAPTER XXXI. HACK TO THE RECTORY. She has ouuoared the darkness of our night. Doctor Holmes arrived in due course at the Rectory. It was evening when he reached his home, and as he approached the house it looked as though it had not been inhabited for many a day \u2014 so gloomy, so desolate ! \" You are welcome back, sir,\" said the faithful old servant, who answered his knock. \" But, sir,\" she continued, \" have you seen Miss Marguerite ? \" \" No. Why do you ask me that ? \" questioned the Doctor, impatiently. \" Why, sir, she left this these many days, saying she was going to follow her sister and watch over her if she could but find her whereabouts.\" \" Strange ! very strange ! \" said the Doctor, thought fully. He questioned the servant further, but she was unable to give him any information as to Marguerite. Having sent the servant to prepare some food, the Doctor was left alone in the sitting-room."], [281, "BACK TO THE RECTORY. 273 He did not like to tell the servant of Edith's run ning away from De Fordyke Hall \u2014 he would not wish to let her know that Edith should have been able so to outwit him. Edith could not have returned to the Rectory, he thought, or he would have been told about it. She must have gone to the prison to Holzapfel. But, then, where was Marguerite ? This altered the aspect of affairs. Marguerite, he had been informed, set out to find her sister. Could she have found her, and, for some reason, unknown to the Doctor, have persuaded her to leave the Hall ? That could hardly be. Still more unaccountable things than that had happened. In this strain ran Dr. Holmes's thoughts while he satisfied his appetite on a much-needed meal. Then he bethought of some plan of seeking out his nieces. Would there be any use iu going back to Ireland \u2014 in journeying to the Hall, for instance ? Could he hear anything of Marguerite or Edith there ? He might, but it was only a chance. At all events the Doctor determined to wait a few days at the Rectory. He might hear something of his nieces, or perhaps they would return in the meantime. The next day came and passed without bringing any tidings of the lost ones. The following day, too, T"], [282, "274 LADY ROSALIND. had wasted to the seventh hour, and Dr. Holmes was contemplating taking his departure for Ireland in the morning, when a loud knock was heard at the Hall door. It was Holzapfel and Edith, the former having overtaken the latter \u2014 for she was delayed on her journey to the Rectory. Holzapfel had explained away all guilt in the matter of shooting Marguerite, stating that he was convinced at the moment that it was a law officer who was following him, and Edith gladly accepted his expl ana tion. He was still wearing his disguise, and was not at first recognized by the Doctor, who was astonished, as well he might be, ou finding who it was. Then f ollowe d an explanation on the part of Edith and Holzapfel as to how she had gone to the prison, where her lover was confined, and assisted him to escap e. They did not, however, tell about the sad fate of Marguerite, whereupon Dr. Holmes inquired if they had seen her or knew anything of her movements. They seemed perplexed at this question, looking nervously from one to the other. Dr. Holmes did not notice this show of anxiety, and Holzapfel answered \u2014 \"We have not seen Marguerite. We thought to find her here. I can't possibly think of where she could be.\""], [283, "275 BACK TO THE RECTORY. This may have been the better course to adopt. Howbeit, Edith approved of it, as might be seen by the expression which passed over her face as Holzapfel spoke the words. \" But I don't think there need be any fear for her safety,\" put in Holzapfel, seeing that Dr. Holmes was somewhat uneasy in this respect. \" You may feel assured that she will be here in a few days at the out side.\" \"Well, let us hope so \u2014 let us hope so,\" said the Doctor, rather despondently. \" If she does not come I must go seek her. The servant says she followed you. I must, therefore, go back to Ireland and try to find her.\" \"But what would bring her after us?\" asked Edith. \" Oh ! I could not tell that,\" answered the Doctor. \" She may have been lonely here, and we had no right to go away and leave her by herself.\" \" That can't be helped now,\" said Holzapfel, in a consolatory tone. \" But I'm sure there is no need to fear \u2014 I feel positive she will return soon.\" Dr. Holmes seemed somewhat pacified on being thus reassured, and so took no present steps with a view to finding Marguerite's whereabouts. He told Holzapfel of how Rembrandt (otherwise Mr. Vyse) was found to be the murderer, and how, although pardoned, Wilhelm"], [284, "276 LADY ROSALIND. was being still pursued with a view to punishment for having escaped. At this Holzapfel did not seem surprised, but it caused him to still keep up his disguise. Three days passed away, and Marguerite, of course, was not forthcoming, and then the Doctor started for Ireland ; not, however, before Holzapfel and Edith were united in the bonds of matrimony. Thus they were made happy \u2014 happy, save for the one galling reflection, namely, the deplorable fate of Marguerite ; and this reflection was as gall and worm wood to them. They never spoke to each other on the subject, but in their silence they thought and brooded over it all the more. Holzapfel continued to wear bis disguise, perhaps through habit more than anything else, for he pro tested that the authorities would never dream of look ing for him at such an out-of-the-way place as the Rectory, and that on this account he did not feel the slightest fear of being apprehended. So far as pecuniary matters were concerned, the happy couple felt no want ; they were bounteously supplied by the Doctor, who (for some reason, perhaps best known to himself) allowed them to use his well stocked \"purse as if the strings were theirs.\" Indeed, on the whole, Holzapfel and his wife were as happy as they could expect to be in this miserable world, for"], [285, "277 BACK TO THE RECTORY. was not the memory of Marguerite and her sad end but a light shadow thrust across their path, a shadow, too, which time would do much towards chasings away ?

STRANGE DUPLICITY. O, God ! O, God ! that it should come to this. Claude Chanteperdrix had been out all day, and was now walking quietly towards Vine Lodge through the surrounding entanglements of the woods, pondering, as was his wont, upon those mysterious problems concerning weary, weary mortals \u2014 their present, the object of their being, and their hereafter. Deeply contemplative he was as he strolled along, coming closer and closer to the Lodge. The shades of evening were falling fast, the bird of night tuned his solitary note from a tree hard by, while the distant murmur of clashing waters waxed and waned upon the gentle breeze. Claude \u2014 dreaming as he walked \u2014 was now quite close to his residence, and for the first time he looked towards the house, and when he did his eyes met a sight stunning and astounding. What was that figure in white which he saw, or thought he saw, on the balcony over the hall door, twisting and writhing as if in agony ? Was it his wife, or was the figure an"], [287, "279 STRANGE DUPLICITY. optical illusion ? If it was the form of his wife why did she writhe and wince, and glare at him so horribly, and still not utter a syllable ? He stood for a moment trembling like an aspen, and then, looking up again in the twilight, he saw the self same figure still on the balcony in the same attitude. That it was his wife he did not now, for a moment, doubt. But what brought her there, and why was she thus? Claude did not waste more time in thinking, but instantly sped to the house, up the stairs into the front room and out on the balcony, where he had seen, or thought he had seen, the form of Lady Rosalind, but when he got there the figure was gone ! And then he almost smiled at his folly in getting into such a fright over what proved to be but the outcome of his ever active imagination. He was about to go and seek his wife, when, at a short distance, amid the trees, his vision was again attracted by the white-clad figure of his wife, standing in the long meadow-grass weeping and wringing her hands ! He looked at her for a moment steadfastly, straining his eyes to make sure that he was not mis taken. It was her figure, certainly. He called aloud again and again, but could not draw her attention. Oh, God ! what could it all mean ? Why did she not answer him ?"], [288, "280 LADY ROSALIND. He called her again by name, but without avail. He shuddered from head to foot, his heart fluttered within him, and now he rushed from the balcony, through the room and down the stairs. When he got to the bottom his wife came out of the sitting-room, stopped him in his speed, and inquired anxiously \u2014 \" What's the matter, Claude ? Were you calling me just now ? \" And then, perceiving how excited he was, she added, quickly : \" Is there anything serious the matter? You look so deadly pale.\" \" Oh ! nothing, nothing,\" answered Claude, trying to subdue his emotion, and passing his hand nervously over his forehead. \" But we \u2014 were you on the balcony, dressed in white, a few moments ago, and were you, even now, out in the grounds ? \" \" No, not I,\" she answered. \" I was reading a book in the parlour. Why do you ask me ? Did you think you saw me ? \" \" I did, I did,\" said Claude, gravely. \"That's strange, very strange,\" murmured Lady Rosalind. \" I have had such strange, unusual sensa tions over me within the last half -hour or so. I felt so drowsy, and could not rouse myself up.

Leave me to myself for a little \u2014 just a little. I'll go up to my room for a while.\" Lady Rosalind felt a little hurt, for this was the first time Claude had spoken in this manner to her. So she went back to the parlour and took up the book she had just laid down, wondering all the while why Claude seemed so ruffled, and why he wished to be alone. She soon knew \u2014 alas ! too soon ! Claude went quickly to his room, and threw himself frantically upon the couch. He wept \u2014 and why did he weep ? Oh, misery of miseries ! Oh, grief without a name ! It was his wife's astral he had seen on the balcony and in the green grass. He thought, too, he saw it now ! And she, oh, mortal, wretched as him self ! had seen his ethereal counterpart passing the window where she sat ! He had studied that mystic science too profoundly. He could not find a subject to practise upon, and the very dread of practising upon his dear wife caused him to think so much upon her in connection with this dangerous pursuit that at length by sheer concentration of thought and will the very ultimatum which he had struggled so hard to avoid, now came to crush him for his audacity, and to mock him and thwart him as long as his spirit lived within the flesh !"], [290, "282 LADY ROSALIND. Oh, crushing blow ! Oh, cruel fate ! Far better, he thought, would it have been had he stopped in that African den than to return to be the cause of such misery. Far better had he stayed in the Vale of Coral, in the depths of the sea. Aye, better there confined in the body of a monster than on this earth to persecute with such a persecution a woman who might otherwise be happy. And then in his depth of woe his mind wandered back to the root and cause of all his misery \u2014 to that fatal signature which caused his ostracism and all the subsequent troubles through which he passed. Feelings akin to revenge took possession of him as he thought of the callousness of that wretch for whom he committed the forgery. Only for him these troubles would not have come upon him. He would never have had to leave his wife and his country ; he would never have met Jacques Rembrandt ; Colonel De Burg would never have been murdered ; and these present evils, and others which he saw looming up before him, would all have been obviated. Why did he not seek out the destroyer of his youthful hopes and aspirations, and avenge his wrongs upon him ?

Suddenly he sprang up and dashed over to the window, uttering a wild, piercing cry, and, lo ! in the dark depths of the pitchy night he again saw his wife, or rather her counterpart, looking still more hideous than before, and now \u2014 horresco referens \u2014 he beheld his own astral standing by his wife, gesticulating wildly and seeming to threaten her with violence. He was only a few moments at the window when his own second-self turned its head towards him and leered at him, shaking its hand threateningly. And now the shadows vanished, and his wife came hastily into the room, exclaiming \u2014 \"What is the meaning of all this, Claude? Have you been out of the room since you came up ? \" \" No, Rosalind,\" he answered. \" Only now,\" continued Lady Rosalind, \" I saw you peering in at me through the parlour door.

So saying he went slowly to the couch and threw himself upon it. \" Read your book a little below, and then come up I'll be all right shortly.\" Lady Rosalind waited a few minutes, and, seeing that Claude fell asleep almost instantly, she settled him comforta.bly, lighted a lamp, and left it on a side table, and then went downstairs, with a view to reading awhile and returning soon again. She had hardly sat down in her chair when she, too, began to feel drowsy. She took up her book and essayed to read, but it slipped gradually from her hands, and her head fell back against the cushioned chair. Sleep had claimed her for its own ! She slept, perhaps, for two hours or more, after which she stole softly upstairs to see if Claude were yet awake. On entering the room she found that he slumbered on. She sat and watched by the couch side for hours, and still he slept, until finally, growing anxious, she thought it advisable to summon a medical man, for she feared that Claude must have been stricken with some dangerous fever or other such severe attack. As for herself, regarding the apparitions, she at once set them down as dreams, for she had been drowsy, and had slept much.

LIVING IN PEACE. Now stand you on the top of happy hours. When Dr. Holmes touched Irish soil he immediately directed his steps to De Fordyke Hall, on reaching which he was much astonished to hear from Jean Tuppitt that Claude and Lady Rosalind had gone to a Yorkshire residence to sojourn for an indefinite period. The gardener was unable to inform Dr. Holmes as to Marguerite. She certainly had not gone there, so far as Jean was aware, and further than that, he, of course, knew nothing. The Doctor, seeing no use in prolonging his visit to the Hall, bade the gardener farewell, and departed. He called at every town of importance in Ireland with a view to tracing Marguerite, inserting advertise ments in all the news-sheets as he went along; and, failing in all his endeavours, he returned well-nigh distracted to the Rectory. Here, however, he received much consolation at the hands of Edith and Holzapfel, who did all in their power to implant new hope in his"], [295, "LIVING IN PEACE. 287 bosom, assuring him that Marguerite, annoyed at being left alone, must have gone on a visit to some friend, and that she would certainly come home soon. This, indeed, was to the Doctor's mind a very feasible solution of the problem, and he accepted it. In truth, he was obliged to rest content, for further search would be a mere wild-goose chase. Holzapfel was now a very different man from what he had been before he went to the Rectory. Troubles had steadied him, as, indeed, they do steady most of us. He had passed through the world's alembic, and the result was of a most desirable nature. All the unlikeable traces had been eliminated from his character, and Edith might well be envied in the possession of such a husband. Edith, too, was changed. She was not, as she had been, a veritable Portia, nor, on the other hand, was she a Jaques, as of late she certainly was; but she had assumed a happy middle course \u2014 solid sense combined with a reasonable amount of buoyancy and cheerfulness. Dr. Holmes grew fonder and fonder every day of Wilhelm and Edith. His love for them, indeed, was more than fatherly ; and he who was once almost niggardly, spared neither expense nor trouble in his endeavour to make the \" young people \" as happy as possible."], [296, "288 LADY ROSALIND. From the time Holzapfel escaped from the prison, constables were out in all directions looking for him. They had tracked him as far as the cave, but there they lost their clue. By some chance or other, how ever, it became known to them that he was at the pre sent time staying somewhere in the west of England ; and even now, while comparative peace reigned at the Rectory, one of these law officers, as ill-luck would have it, was lurking about the locality thereof, seeking for some missing link or clue. So it was that one forenoon, as Edith sat in the drawing-room window of the Rectory singing sweetly, accompanying herself on the mandoline, while Holzapfel listened spellbound within, a tall, handsomely-dressed young gentleman was seen sallying up the sloping avenue which led to the Rectory. He sauntered leisurely towards the open window in which Edith sat, murmuring to himself as he ap proached, such phrases as \" Damn good-looking girl,\" \" Deuced pretty,\" etc., which, however, did not reach the ears of the object of these choice epithets. \"Mo'ning! Fine mo'ning ; excellent weather,\" said the stranger, smilingly, addressing Edith, who had ceased singing, and not noticing Holzapfel, who sat in his disguise within. \" Do you wish to see the Doctor ? \" inquired Edith, stiffly, displeased at the forward, obtrusive manner of the man before her."], [297, "289 LIVING IN PEACE. \" Oh, no ! \" he answered ; \" perhaps you would do as well. Truth is, I have been looking out for a gentle man friend of mine, who was last heard of in these parts, named Wilhelm Holzapfel. Could you have met with him ? \" Holzapfel trembled. \"No ; I am not aware that I have,\" returned Edith, firmly. She was prepared for answering such questions. She suspected that her questioner was a constable, and she was right. \" Have you, father, heard of anyone of that name being about here ? \" asked Edith, turning to Hol zapfel. \" No, child ; I have not. Hoi \u2014 what did you say ? \" returned Holzapfel, assuming a broken voice for the occasion. \" Holzapfel \u2014 Wilhelm Holzapfel,\" put in the constable. \" No ; I don't remember to have ever even heard the name,\" rejoined Wilhelm, reflectively. \" What was he ? Perhaps you could give us some descriptive clue? \" \" Well ! \" went on the constable, in a confiding tone, \" I don't mind telling a respectable old gentleman like you, but I'm a constable.

He made his escape from prison, since which time he has been found innocent of the crime, another being guilty. Still, we are ordered to find him, in order that he maybe punished for having wilfully planned, plotted, and carried out his escape from imprisonment.\" \" I see,\" said Holzapfel. \" Well, we have been living here these two years or more \u2014 my daughter, and the Rector, and myself \u2014 and I don't remember one stranger crossing our threshold during that time. You see, this is a very quiet place ; few in these parts are burdened much with visitors ; we seldom see a stranger here. A small place like this little village is not a likely place, in my opinion, for an escaped prisoner to make his retreat.\" \" That's so,\" said the constable ; \" but we have been told that the person we are searching for was seen about this neighbourhood, and, in obedience to orders, we must search, if for nothing else but form's sake.

For other constables had been about scouring all parts of the kingdom, and they had now given up the attempt to find Holzapfel as futile. Dr. Holmes still grieved much over the loss of Marguerite \u2014 grieved silently. He was one of those apparently cold natures that ever show the least of their love, but ever love the most ; and the loss of Marguerite was a severe shock to him. He had done all that was possible to ascertain what had become of her, and now he concluded that the only end she could have met with was drowning \u2014 somewhere along the dangerous, cliff-lined coast, where she was wont to walk ; or \u2014 the thought rushed at times upon him with overwhelming force \u2014 perhaps she had thrown herself into a watery grave. He always banished this idea immediately it entered his brain ; he did not wish to dwell upon it. Time sped apace, and the Doctor abandoned all hope regarding his lost niece.

Later on, a beautiful bright-eyed little girl, with long, curly, auburn hair, might be seen playing about the Rectory, jabbering in baby talk to Edith, running about playfully after her father, or sitting in the even ing upon Dr. Holmes's knee, amusing him with her childish chat. The Doctor simply adored her ; he thought there was never such a child in the world as she. And now let us not look beyond 'to see whether the latter part of the hapless Marguerite's dream was realized, viz., that portion which seemed to shadow forth that Holzapfel would die, leaving Edith tossing alone on the world ; let us not draw the veil hiding the future.

Striving to be man, the worm Mounts through all the spires of form. Lady Rosalind watched long and anxiously by the bedside of her husband. She feared that he had been seized by some destructive malady, which would hold him in its fearful grip until life had wasted from out his weakened body. When the messenger (one of the poor but kindly and obliging folk of the neighbourhood) reached the doctor's house, which was about four miles away, he found that the medical man was out upon a sick call. He was informed, however, that the doctor, immediately on his return, would proceed with as little delay as possible to Vine Lodge ; and this message he brought back to Lady Rosalind. Lady Rosalind grew more and more apprehensive of evil, as well she might, for now Claude got perceptibly colder and colder ; his face assumed an ashy colour, while his heart, so far as she could ascertain, had ceased to beat. She was seized with terror and excitement, and in"], [302, "294 LADY ROSALIND. her despair or nervous uncertainty she grew impatient. She bent down over her husband, and called his name, gently at first, and then more loudly ; but no answer came. In woe she called aloud, but she heard nothing but the taunting echo of her own voice in reply. She burst forth into tears, and paced the room in anguish and despair, wringing her hands and tossing them in the air. The faithful servant tried to console and calm her, but without avail. This was the state of affairs when, in two hours time, the doctor arrived. He immediately examined Claude, whereupon he shook his head mourn fully. Seeing that Lady Rosalind was in such a state of grief he thought to himself that it would be useless to keep back the truth \u2014 useless to keep her longer in uncertainty ; it would be just as well to let her bear the shock at once. So he again shook his head sorrow fully, saying in a low tone \u2014 \" Bead ! dead ! He's gone these three hours. Had I been called then I might have been able to revive him, but now all hope is gone.\" Lady Rosalind was now calm, standing at the foot of the bed, and gazing rather vacantly at the placid face of Claude. She did not seem to heed the doctor's words. \" Heart disease ! heart disease ! \" continued the medical man. \" Has he been complaining of his heart ? \""], [303, "295 A HOUSE OF TEARS. Lady Rosalind did not answer the question ; but at that instant she turned quickly round, and in doing so she uttered a wild shriek. The doctor stood dumb founded while she peered through the open door, ex claiming \u2014 \" There he is ! Ah ! I see it all now Yes, there before her she beheld her husband's astral in the self-same attitude which it assumed when she saw it in the Abode of Probation. The truth \u2014 the dreadful truth \u2014 rushed upon her mind, making her heart beat wildly, and a sickening sensation creep through her frame ; for now she could trace the con nection between what she had seen in the Abode of Probation and what she now saw and had been seeing on earth. Now could she see how the dumb show in that dread place foreshadowed events in connection with her future on this earth. The fact forced itself overwhelmingly upon her that those figures she had seen upon this earth were the self-same figures which she had seen in the Abode of Probation. Now did she fully realize the meaning of the words \" The shadow of a shadow.\" But by what influence could those second selves be brought to this earth ? Claude had told her that it was all his doing \u2014 all his fault ; that he had thought too much, and now she saw through it all. He, by some hidden means, had caused these astrals to appear.

It disappeared, and then she came back into the room, weeping and wailing piteously. She stalked madly about, raving, mutter ing, and sawing the air with her arms. The doctor, who up to this had been regarding her curiously, now tried to soothe and quiet her, but he could not do so. She still raved, seemingly uncon scious that there was anyone in the apartment. \" There he is again,\" she exclaimed, pointing towards the open window, and trembling all over like an aspen shaken in the wind. \" Who ? What r \" inquired the doctor, but Lady Rosalind did not heed his interrogative. She still moved frantically about. The only conclusion that the doctor could come to was that she had lost her senses through the shock of her husband's demise. * Claude was wrong in his theory (implied in a former chapter) that the astral or spiritual counterpart occupied the same space as the material body.

He rang for the servant, and by her aid carried the fainting woman to an adjoining room, where he soon discovered that Lady Rosalind was suffering from a severe attack of brain fever ; in addition to which, through sheer excitement and exhaustion, she had sunk into a heavy swoon. Restoratives were applied, by means of which her ladyship was soon resuscitated, but alas ! she awoke only to toss from side to side on her couch, and to rave about Claude and the figures she had seen. The servant was in a state of great sorrow about her master and mistress, and the good-natured doctor pro cured a nurse to assist her in her attendance on Lady Rosalind, and undertook the management of the entire funeral arrangements regarding Claude. The faithful servant, who had charge of the purse during her mistress's illness, made sure that a suitable vault was selected in the cemetery abbey, wherein the remains of her respected master should be interred.

She thought of bringing the body of her mistress back to De Fordyke Hall, in order to have her interred in the family burial place ; and then she thought it would be better to have her buried along with her husband. In the absence of being able to communicate on the matter with Jean Tuppitt (for there was no post in those days) she con - suited the genial doctor, who advised that she should let Lady Rosalind be interred with her husband. This being the more natural as well as the more con venient course to adopt, it was the one followed by the servant, who (having seen all that was mortal of her mistress laid respectfully in the cold vault beside Claude) made up her mind to return in a few days to De Fordyke Hall, where she would narrate to old Jean Tuppitt all that had occurred \u2014 everything in connec tion with Lady Rosalind and Claude."], [308, "CHAPTER XXXV.

Without seeing that his wife lay in the coffin beside the one from which he had bounded, he rushed out of the cell, and in a few moments was speeding, in the dark, towards Vine Lodge.
