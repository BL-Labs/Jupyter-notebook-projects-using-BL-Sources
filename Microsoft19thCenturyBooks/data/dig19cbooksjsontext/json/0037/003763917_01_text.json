ROBERT VAUGHAN, D.D., PRESIDENT OF THE LANCASHIRE INDEPENDENT COLLEGE, THESE POEMS ARE DEDICATED BY HIS AFFECTIONATE SON, itye author."], [12, ""], [13, "PREFACE. There are, probably, many persons who would find little to interest them in the following poems. But in giving such expression to some of his thoughts and sympathies, the Author has found an employment which has not been unpleasing, nor, as he hopes, unprofitable ; and he is willing to believe, that there are readers who will par ticipate in some measure in his feeling. It may be proper to state, that these pieces are all the productions of one writing in his minority; and if it be objected, that prudence might have dictated another course than that of appearing as an author on such ground at so unripe an age, my plea in behalf of this temerity must be in the argument in such case provided by Quinctilian : \" Fructum studiorum viridem et adhuc dulcem a 2"], [14, "IV promi decet, dum et venia et spes est et paratus favor;\"* and in the fact, that few men have learned to face criticism with effect, who have not been inured to it early. The view taken in the poem, of the scene that passed in the cave of the witch, at Endor, is fully authorised, I conceive, by the Scripture account, with the exception, of course, of the incantation, and the reply of the spirits. Many respectable authorities favour the opinion, that what appeared to Saul was merely the result of a contrivance practised by the sorceress, or else an evil angel who assumed the form of Samuel. But the argu ments adduced by Dr. Henderson in his Divine Inspiration, Stackhouse, in his History of the Bible, Calmet, (Dissert, sur TApparition de Samuel,) Dr. Hales, Saurin, and AYaterland, to show that it was really the ghost of the prophet, seem to me unanswerable. Five times it is ex pressly stated in the Scripture narrative, that what they saw was Samuel. Saul and his attend ants came upon the woman by night, before she had time to make preparations for any imposture. It would have been her interest rather to flatter * Inst. Orator, lib. xii. cap. vi."], [15, "\\11 and console the king, than to invent a reply so unwelcome. It is less difficult to believe in the appearance of Samuel himself, than in that of an evil spirit. Though it is not improbable that some angel or angels of darkness might have been permitted to assist the witch in her evil practices, her surprise at the sight of Samuel, is a sufficient proof, that neither he, nor any being personating him, came up in obedience to her summons. Satan could have had no end to gain by a procedure of this sort, and the lan guage ascribed to Samuel is most unnatural in the mouth of an evil spirit. In order to render intelligible the two frag ments relating to the story of Cupid and Psyche, it may be as well to remind some of my readers, that according to the ancient fable, Psyche is conveyed to a magic palace in the heart of a secluded valley, where she is nightly visited by Cupid, whom she never sees, and who warns her that fearful consequences will ensue, if any dis trust induces her to make an attempt to discover his form. Her jealous sisters tell her that her husband is in reality a monstrous serpent, who will one day devour her ; and persuade her to secrete a lamp in the chamber, and provide herself with a"], [16, "vm knife, that she may be assured of the fact, and kill him. She complies with their advice; and while she gazes in admiration on the beauty of the god of love, a drop of burning oil from the lamp falling on his shoulder awakes him. He starts up, and seeing at once the evidence of her faithlessness, silently flies away. The remainder of the tale describes what she underwent in her search after the god, to whom she is at length happily re-united. Every reader acquainted with this philosophical allegory, will be aware of the interpretations which have been attached to it."], [17, "CONTENTS.

It was a palace with long colonnades, And marble halls where fountains used to pour Their whispering rain that wooed the winds and shades, And latticed windows round the corridor, Breeze-loving, gazed on many a fairy scene, AVhile flowers with timid eyes looked in between. The opening doors gave forth no jarring sound\u2014 A gentle sigh. On winds faint music flew, And quickly-waking echoes whispered round Remembered words \u2014 and falling footsteps too, Beloved of old, seemed nigh \u2014 yet never came, And eyes gave looks that vanished like a flame.

Some watched the sunset in the deep-flushed west, And gazing on forgot they were alone ; Some thought them leaning o'er the snowy breast Of seaward rocks, and hearkening to the tone Of far-down, falling waves, while to and fro Cloud-shadows passed o'er the smooth seas below. Oh ! many a changing scene would each behold, Bringing back hours love-haunted ; \u2014 one except, Whose loved one died ere yet his love was old ; Nought saw he but the grave wherein she slept \u2014 He gazed elsewhere \u2014 that one still grave again \u2014 Alas ! his past could only speak of pain.

A voice from heaven ! Youthful Light went forth, Warred on grey Chaos, and cast down his corse Over the steeps of the new firmament ; But from the dying lips one sigh there passed That dieth not, \u2014 it runs a silent race Side-long with Time \u2014 it hurried shadow-like O'er the young faces of the morning stars \u2014 And they are songless now, and changed, and old. That deathless sigh is Mutability. Much hath it loved our earth, and still it plays With her hoar locks, and watches in her eyes That grow more dim with every century.

The infant Earth heaved with gigantic change, And slowly rocks uprose in barkless seas Flinging long shadows on the deep disturbed, And oceans changed their seats with all their waves Marshalled about them, treading on the realm Where elk and mammoth roamed in tangled wolds ; Broad lands sunk down, and the exulting sea Rushed foaming in to fill the ghastly pit. Earth's features, sculptured long, are now grown old, But though confusion's reign hath passed away Ever among us moves the noiseless foot Of Mutability, earth-traversing. The aery visions, the dear hopes of men, Like many waves arise in a wide sea, Its breath their arching summits tips with foam, They waver, bend, and fall. It fills the world AYith floating leaves stripped from the tree of joy, It whirls the Past along in a dim stream Down to the chasm of dusk Obscurity, Which History's tottering bridge hangs half-way o'er, Whence men peer out into the night beneath.

It is whispered oft By the sere lips of tremulous autumn leaves, And Age's thin grey locks, and by the surge That ever runs around the brimmed sea, With breakers wild or faintly-ebbing waves, Fretting the dark -brown sand. There is a stream, A silver thread that winds throughout the world, The stream of Hope, and oft Change ruffles it Or makes it dark \u2014 but nathless wandering on It flashes out like sparkles of a river That, shadow-laden, yet looks laughing up At the deep gloom of over-hanging trees. Yet cometh one with terrible beauty crowned ; Changeless Eternity's majestic glance Shall wither Change \u2014 and then this wandering breath Shall wandering haunt no more the waning world, But in the ruins of this earth, its home, Shall disappear \u2014 as some o'er-wearied bird Out on the far seas droppeth fluttering down, And o'er it close the surges thronging bright. g2"], [86, "BABEL Far through the misty forest of old days Wanders my thought to thee, long-fallen tower !
