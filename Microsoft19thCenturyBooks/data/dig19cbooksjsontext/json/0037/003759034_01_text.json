MADAM, \"V\" O U must not be surprized if you here find a wide Alteration from the usual Style of Dedications. The Idea which is generally understood in penning these Com positions, is to dwell upon the Character, and enumerate the Actions of the Persons addressed, attended with a long Train of Panegyrics, and lay out a considerable Space in forming elegant Compliments. But your Ladyship has compelled me to deviate from this general Mode. You have sustained a Character which cannot possibly be commented upon but with the utmost severity. You have accustomed yourself in the Performance of Actions, since your first A % Know-"], [6, "( H ) Knowledge os Sensibility, that cannot be related without offending the delicate Hearing of Modesty. Your Ladyship has placed it in my Power to display here a horrid Picture of Infamy. You who have ran thro' all the changes and vicissitudes of Dissipation \u2014 have openly plunged yourself into the Gulph of Carnal Variety, without pourtraying even an inclination of Reluctance. When I first entertained an Idea of Writing a Poem on the subject of Variety,, I confess I was for some Time at a loss, who it should be Addressed to \u2014 but your Ladyship has com passionately eased me os that embarrassed Situa tion, by publicly supporting a Character to which this poetic Trifle is Dedicated with infinite propriety.
