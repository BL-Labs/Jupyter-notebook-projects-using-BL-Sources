He had two brothers, one of whom, owned a private bank, the other was a retired stock-broker; and either of them, as they afterwards told me, would have been very glad to take me by the hand, had my father applied to them.

If ever he reflected upon the future, he could scarcely, I am sure, understand that it should mean more than a perpetual succession of morning strolls, and afternoon siestas, and evening whist parties. He pursued day after day, Avith automatic regularity, a small round of trifling and monotonous distractions, which by degrees girdled his existence AAith the narrowest possible horizon, and prevented him from sympathising with any needs which, like mine, lay outside the sphere of his dady routine.

On coming to a bend of the road, I saw on my right the red roofs and church spires and glittering vanes, and smoking chimneys of a toAvn built on the sloping sides of two hills. \"Is that Updown?\" I asked. The coachman said it was. I gazed at it with interest. Distance softened ad rude and commonplace details, and, in the silver sunshine, the town looked fairy-like. The central street, which ran straight as a line through the heart of the vadey, was made wonderfully picturesque by a great archway. We branched off just as we were getting near enough to see the houses distinctly, and, in about ten minutes, drove through a gate, along a 7 O O 7 Q pleasant avenue, and stopped before an"], [51, "JUT UNCLE'S SCHEME. 41 exceedingly pretty house, with gleaming conservatories on either side, and hedged about AAith a great profusion of shrub bery.

I felt travel wTorn and soiled, and wished my uncle had given me an opportunity of making myself a little fresher-looking before in troducing me to his wife and daughter. I made a low bow and took my aunt's hand ; she welcomed me in a very mild and pleasing manner. My cousin Conny then came up to me and shook my hand, looking very shy and charming. She was exceedingly pretty. Up to that time, I don't think I had ever seen her equal. As to Pauline Gautier \u2014 pshaw ! There"], [54, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 44 was no comparison to be made. Pauline was brown ; Conny had a skin of snow, and hair of gold, and large, modest, dark blue eyes, and a swTeet and saucy nose, and a small mouth, and a transporting figure. I can't describe the dress she wore. No man but a shopkeeper ought to be able to describe a woman's cos tume. Shall I tell you why ? because a woman's style ought to be too perfect for a man to notice details. Depend upon it, there is something gross in that woman's taste, whose dress, after leaving her, a man is able to describe. My aunt was a stout, healthy-looking woman, red-cheeked, with a most amiable cast of countenance. I was impressed by the size of her cap, and her walk, which was a waddle. My uncle pushed a chair forwards for me to be seated ; he and"], [55, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 45 the ladies then ranged themselves round me, and we began to converse. \" I was delighted to hear from my brother. How is he ? \" \" Very well indeed.

And then said my uncle : \"You'll find French very useful to you in business. How do you like the idea \u2022of being a banker ? \" \" I know nothing about it,\" I answered. I was proud of my ignorance. I be lieved it w^ould impress Conny. I felt, in short, like the West-end gentleman who asked a friend where the city was. \" We'll soon teach you,\" said my uncle, cheerily. \" I wish you had made up your"], [57, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 47 mind to live with us. I have taken lodgings for you in the town, as you desired, but I am sure you would have been more comfortable here.\" I felt disposed to agree with him. Certainly the house appeared a very delightful one, and I must say that I had had no idea I owned such a pretty cousin as Conny. But still I reflected that the habits of the old people might be entirely opposed to mine ; and it would be hideous to have to submit to any kind of restraint, after the long years of billiards, tobacco, and freedom I had enjoyed at Longueville. \"At all events,\" said my aunt, \"you can alwTays come here if you don't find your quarters comfortable.

There seemed a little more keenness and slyness in their glance than I should have thought such innocent, maidenly, tender, blue eyes capable of. But oh, Euoenio ! what is there more deceitful in life than a pretty girl ? Does thy heart bleed ? Mine has bled. I have tried to pick a rose, and have pulled away nothing but four fingers and a thumb stuffed with thorns. \" You will dine with us to-day,\" said my uncle. \"Afterwards, James shall drive you to your quarters.

My aunt then told her husband to take me upstairs ; it was nearly five, and dinner would soon be ready. So I followed my uncle to a bed-room, and there, as I brushed my hair and curled my mustache, I wondered what sort of an impression I had made on my rela tions. I thought of my father's advice, and wished I knew how to be as magni ficent as he. He had often told me that his brothers had a very high respect for him, and considered him the prop and decoration of the family name. I thought this quite likely. People in business do respect professional relations.

Addressing myself to my aunt, I com-"], [65, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 55 plimented her upon the beauty of the grounds, a glimpse of which I could catch through the windows, and entered easily into a conversation, in which my uncle and Conny joined with great readiness. My uncle gained upon me. Yellow, and spare, and shrewd as his face was, a great deal of heart and amiability were mixed up in it. He was five years younger than my father, but wras one of those men who look fifty when they are thirty, and forty when they are sixty. He had lank black hair, and a long nose, and a spasmodic way of speaking, as if, after delivering himself of a few sentences, he found difficulty in breathing. I asked him what time the bank closed. \"At four,\" he answered. \"The clerks generally get awTay by half-past.\" \" Do you like the idea of being a"], [66, "56 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. banker's clerk ? \" inquired Conny, with a gleam of mischief in her blue unfathom able eyes. \" I haven't the least notion,\" I replied. \"All that I know about banks is that they are places where you offer cheques and receive money for them.\" \" True,\" said my uncle, with a laugh ; \" but people must work very hard in order to induce the banks to change those cheques into money.\" \" I wonder your papa didn't put you into the army,\" said Conny. \"Would not you have liked to be a soldier ? \" \"It is immaterial to me what I am, provided I am easy in my mind, and have time now and then to smoke a cigar,\" answered I, with the lofty languor of an exquisite of the first water. Conny laughed merrily ; but, being afraid"], [67, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. \u25a0j 7 that my answer was a rather ungracious one, all things considered, I changed the subject by asking my uncle if he smoked. Yes, he did smoke, incessantly, Mrs. Har- grave told me ; which meant that he had a cigar after dinner and a cigar with his grog before going to bed. I should have probably pointed out that my uncle wTas extraordinarily moderate in his consump- tion of tobacco, and have proceeded to give a sketch of our club in the Pate des Chiens, and the immense quantity of tabac Jin and cigars that were smoked there at a sitting, had not dinner been announced. I gave my arm to my aunt, and, followed by Conny and her papa, marched into the dining-room, a charming apartment with a large window conducting on to the lawn, and glass doors leading into the conserva- tory, the walls hung with good paintings,"], [68, "58 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. and the whole of the furniture in happy taste. The setting sun wras shining in front, and filled the room with long slant ing rules of pink light, the effect of which was to make Conny, who took a seat fronting me, bewitchingly pretty. I had tasted no food since eia;ht o'clock that morning, and therefore did abundant justice to the very good dinner that had been provided for me. My uncle wTas a capital host. He allowed me to eat instead of dis- turbing me with remarks, and damaging my appetite by obliging me to talk. His wines were capital ; his cook, like Bayard, sans reproche; I said to him, holding up a glass of Madeira, \" My father would appreciate this.\" \" Yes,\" he answered ; \" why doesn't he come and see us? I should find him aged, no doubt ; but he was always a"], [69, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 59 handsome man.\" And he began to tell us stories of his and his brother's young days, and how a certain young lady broke her heart wiien my father went to India, and how another young lady turned Roman Catholic, and faded into a white veil, wiien my father married. I thought Conny looked sentimental whilst she lis tened. I caught her eye once, during these startling revelations, but saw that she was not thinking of me by her abstracted air. By the time the sweets were on the table, I was qualified for any amount of conversation. I talked of Longueville, and of the Emperor's bow to my father, the major, described the Empress and her style, as well as I could, her fine taste and sweet face, and graceful manners \u2014 indeed, I talked so much of"], [70, "60 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. the imperial pair, whom I had only seen once or twice at Longueville, that my aunt got the extraordinary impression in her head that I wras an intimate friend of theirs, as I afterwards learned, by her boasting to a friend that, \" Charlie was often with the Emperor and Empress of the French at Longueville.\" True to my resolution to deal with life as splendidly as I could, and not a little excited into a disposition to dazzle by Conny's intoxi cating eyes, I talked of some titled acquaintances of mine at Longueville, and, I believe, dove-tailed their valuable names into my remarks, with surprising effect. I spoke of the capital cigars Lord Towers used to give me ; of the gambling propensities of the Honourable Mr. Spadille, Lord Shallowman's brother, who tried to induce the members of our"], [71, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 61 club to play for guinea points ; of the Marchioness of Cliffeton's little suppers in the Rue de Ville, &c, &c. Do you think I told them that Lord Towers skulked in Longueville, because he durst not show his face in London for fear of Mr. Sloman ? That the Honourable Mr. Spadille, Lord Shallowman's brother, had bolted from Leamington with Colonel Corney's wife ? That the Countess of Cliffeton \u25a0 \u2014 bah ! What's in a name ? some times a blackguard. What's in a lion's skin ? very often an ass. The characters of certain of the English nobility residing in Longueuille were nothing to nobody. All that I wanted was, that my uncle, and aunt, and Conny of the celestial eyes, should understand that a young gentleman, named Charles Hargrave, wiio, out of respect for his"], [72, "62 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. father, the major, and out of regard for his owti prospects, had condescended to become a banker's clerk, had frequently waltzed with a marchioness, and pledged her at her own table in unpaid champagne, had invariably addressed an English baron by a convivial nickname, and had very often helped to put the intoxicated brother of a North British nobleman to bed. I don't know if my uncle was im pressed; but my aunt was, and I rather think Conny was, too. An irresistible thrill of pride ran through me, wiien my aunt, leaning across the table, said -with great earnestness, \"I am afraid, Mr. Charles, you will despise the position Thomas has offered you ; but though the profession of bank ing has sunk rather low since our day,"], [73, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 63 there are still plenty of gentlemen engaged in it.\" There was no sneer in this ; I should have instantly felt it had there been. \" Banking may have sunk low in other places,\" said Conny, with a heightened colour, \" but I am sure papa's clerks are gentlemen.\" \" I am not so sure,\" replied my aunt, who every moment was proving herself to be a deliciously candid woman. \" Oh, Curling's a gentleman,\" said my uncle, \" and so is Sjuatling, though his name might be grander.\" \" Mr. Curling is gentlemanly, I admit, but I don't consider him to be a gentle man,\" exclaimed my aunt. Conny picked at a bit of bread and twisted the fragments into little balls. \" Oh, I am sure I shall like banking,"], [74, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 64 Mrs. Hargrave,\" said I, with fine con descension. \" Of course,\" I continued, waving my hand in imitation of my father, who would gesticulate in that manner in a very impressive and polished way: \"if I had an income of my own, however small, I should have preferred to continue as I was. But necessity is one of those things to which noblemen as well as ploughmen must submit.\" \" True,\" said my uncle with a nod. \"Help yourself to more wine.\" \" I should have thought,\" observed my candid aunt with a face full of sober honesty, and in a tone that quite forbade all notion that any irony was intended, \" that you wTould have been able to marry very well.\" \" Oh, oh ! give him time \u2014 give him time ! \" chuckled my uncle."], [75, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 65 \" I have never been in love,\" said I. Conny's deep eyes, full of mournfulness, met mine. \" I have a great horror, Mrs. Hargrave,\" I went on, \" of men wiio marry only for 7) money. \"And so have I,\" said Conny. \" Eh ? you ? \" cried her papa, fondly. \" What do you know of these matters ? \" \" Money,\" I observed \u2014 a sucking Daniel come to judgment ! \u2014 \" is no doubt very necessary ; but I never will admit that it can be the foundation of married hap- pmess. Nobody at that table had said that it was ; and the observation wras therefore uncalled for. But I used to be a lover of slashing commonplaces. \" I quite agree with you,\" said Conny, VOL. I. p"], [76, "66 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. looking, as she spoke, a thorough child of sensibility. \" Mayn't love and money be sometimes combined ? \" suggested my aunt deferen tially, as if henceforth and for ever she never meant to be sure of anything until I had given judgment. \" I doubt it,\" I replied, and I gave her my reasons : firstly, because, if the woman had money, she would always be suspi cious of the man's sincerity ; and secondly \u2014 but why print myself an ass ? I spoke much indescribable folly ; though, let me tell you, I never saw anybody look more pleased than Conny as she listened to me.

I glanced at Conny, who, catching my eye, said saucily, \" All men like their freedom ; but what a freedom it is ! it is a horrid slavery to tobacco, late hours, and to everything bad for the health.\" Here wTas an opportunity for saying something singularly neat and smart ; but I missed it from sheer want of wit. The ladies now left the table. The sun had sunk behind the hills, but many gorgeous tints lingered behind, and made the quiet sky beautiful. My uncle, lifting"], [80, "70 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. his head out of his cravat, fixed a dys peptic eye upon me, and bade me draw my chair near his and fill my glass. I cannot express how much I liked the honest, homely amiability of his manner. He seemed to me the very essence of kindness. We had a long chat about my father, of whom he was very proud and fond, and asked me many questions about his habits and opinions and means. He then talked of my other uncle, Richard, and his daughter Theresa, -whom he described as a very fine girl, but so eccentric in her conduct as to cause some uneasiness to her father, who was anxious to get her married. \" If she is handsome and has money,\" I observed, \" surely a husband ought to be easily got for her.\" \" Dick tells me she has had several"], [81, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 71 admirers,\" answered my uncle, \" but she is so confoundedly fastidious that nobody is able to please her. What do you think of Conny ? \" \" She is a cousin to boast of.

An only child is not always so wrell favoured. When nature is mean, she is generally mean with a ven geance. But Conny is a sly puss ; she has made her mamma and me a little uneasy latterly.\" \" Indeed ! \" \" My cashier, Curling, is a rather good looking young fellow, and Mrs. Hargrave has got an idea in her head that Conny admires him.\""], [82, "72 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. \" Oh, there is no harm in that.\" \" She is afraid that Conny likes him.\" \" Women often have the queerest tastes,\" said I uneasily. Why was I irritated by my aunt's suspicion ? \" Did you notice that my wife rather poo-pooh'd bankers' clerks ? \" \"I did.\" \" That was done for a motive,\" said my uncle with a twinkling eye. \" My wife is a shrewd woman. I have no. right to be her trumpeter, but I must say that very few women have my wife's sagacity.\" \" Is Mr. Curling a gentleman ? \" \" I believe so. He is a London man. But he's no match for my daughter, I can tell you.\" \" I should think not,\" said I jealously and warmly; \"very few men are.\""], [83, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 73 \" However,\" continued my uncle, twist ing a wine-glass round upon the table, \" all this may be a mere delusion on the part of your aunt.\" [Your aunt!

I dropped my assur ances to the contrary after a little, being perfectly satisfied to be included in the rank of those who have honour thrust upon them, and went up to Conny and asked her to play. \"You would much rather smoke a cigar with papa than listen.\" \" Before I grow eloquent,\" said I, with"], [85, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 75 a smile, \" I should like to know if I may call you Constance ? \" \" Oh, I believe cousins are privileged.\" \" And after I have called you Constance a few times, just for form's sake, may I address you as Conny ? \" \" Call me what you please,\" she replied, with the loveliest flush of pink in her fair cheeks. \" Then,\" said I, \" Constance, so for from wishing to smoke, I would be per fectly content to give up that habit for ever, if you would but consent to play tke piano to me, every time a longing came across me for a cigar.\" \" That's a little story,\" she said in a whisper.

Oh no ; she liked it, She owned that she didn't much care about pipes, but she knew no smell so fragrant as that of a good cigar. \" Don't you think my brother the major would enjoy this ? \" said my uncle, lying back in a capacious arm-chair. \" It would be his ideal of happiness,\" I answered.

What a fool I was to permit my ridiculous fears to pre vent me living at Grove End !

So I assured Conny, in my loftiest manner, that she was quite in error; that I never for a moment doubted that I should be received and treated \u2014 as I had been \u2014 with delightful kindness ; that my reason for declining her papa's and mamma's offer, was my disinclination to burden their home with the presence of a bachelor, whose ways and habits \u2014 here I repeated what I had before said to my aunt ; taking care, however, to exhibit those \" ways and habits,\" to"], [93, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 83 which I alluded in a light that could not fail to make them imposing and lordly, and precisely such characteristics as would naturally belong to a young gentleman who had mingled all his life in the society of men of high birth and distinguished positions. My uncle wanted to accompany me to my lodgings, and \"see me comfortable for the night,\" as he said ; and my aunt encouraged him to do so. But I was firm \u2014 I said no. I would not hear of his leaving the house to be my com panion in a long drive through the night-air. I had my way ; and my port manteau being hoisted into the phaeton, I followed it amid a chorus of good nights, and hopes that I would sleep well. The road to Updown was pretty hilly,"], [94, "84 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. but smooth and good : and, in a very short time, the little mare had rattled us into the High Street.

After a pretty long interval, a key was turned, a chain unslipped, a bolt with drawn, and an elderly woman, with a candle over her head, stood forth. I told her who I was ; whereupon she dropped me a curtsey, and said she had quite given me up for that day. James brought in my portmanteau, and went away, thanking me for a little trifle I gave him. The elderly woman then con ducted me into a good-sized parlour, which she said wras my sitting-room, very comfortably furnished, with a good large"], [95, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 85 sofa in it, that took my fancy mightily. She then led me to my bed-room, and this apartment I also found unexception able in all points. She asked me if I would take tea, and on my saying yes, she went away to prepare it, whilst I unpacked my portmanteau. When I re turned to the parlour, I found it cheerful and brilliant, with a fine old-fashioned od lamp ; the tea-things were on the table, and the pretty crockery made me feel as much at home as if I had lodged with Mrs. Reeves a year. So far everything that had befallen me was entirely to my taste.

After tea I lighted a pipe and stretched myself along the sofa and thought over matters. It was, perhaps, all for the best that I had decided not to live at Grove End. I could keep up my dignity better by residing at a dis tance. No doubt I should be asked there as often as I cared to be ; and I should certainly enjoy my kind-hearted relations' hospitality not the less because I could combine my privileges with personal inde pendence. Conny ran in my head a good deal. What a little pet she was I I could love that girl, I thought. Who wTas Curling ? Did she like him ?

What ! a banker's clerk, a man of pass-books and cancelled cheques against a gentle man who knew nothing of business, who thought money an insufferable bore, and credit the easiest and most courtly way of supplying one's needs ; who was a man of the world, a great favourite with women, a good billiard player, and the friend, the intimate friend, of men who, were it not for their tailors and hatters, would be making brilliant with their presence and wit the high society from which the heartless dun or the yet more inexorable bailiff"], [98, "88 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. had obliged them to beat a precipitate retreat. I laughed at the absurdity of the idea. Why, in all probability, Conny was already in love with me. Of course they were talking about me at Grove End.

He was in it, and waved his hand to me. \" Up already ! \" he cried, springing briskly into the road. \" Conny has lost a pair of gloves. She bet me that I should find you in bed.\" \" She deserves to lose,\" said I, laughing, \"for having such a bad opinion of me.\" \" How did you sleep ? Did you like your rooms ?

I bowed loftily, and fixed a scrutinising eye upon the young gentle man. He was more cordial, and offered me his hand. \"Glad to know you, Mr. Hargrave,\" said he. \" I am much obliged to you,\" I replied. \" Yonder is Mr. Spratling,\" said my uncle, smiling at the youth who had turned his head on hearing his name pro nounced. I nodded, and Mr. Spratling stared. My uncle then went round the counter, calling to me to follow, and going up to a desk behind the ground glass front, said, \" This will be your place, Charlie,\" and watched my face ; but I said nothing, though I could have commented in very forcible terms upon the immense inconvenience it would be to me \u2014 a lounger born \u2014 of having to sit"], [104, "94 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. on a high stool all day and write down dry bucolic names and rows of figures in a huge book called a ledger. My uncle then conducted me into his private office at the back, and leaning against the table, asked me, with a rather humorous twinkle in his eye, \" How my look-out struck me ? \" \" I'll tell you -what,\" I answered, seating myself, for it was always my opinion that you can't make a greater mistake than to stand when you can sit ; \" I'll tell you what, uncle ; you are such a thoroughly good fellow, with so nice a sense of what is due to a gentleman, that I believe, after a little, I shall be able to endure this life.

Mr. Curling bowed as I passed out, and I returned his salute politely. I felt more at my ease now that my uncle had told me that these young men were to regard me as a gentleman who had condescended to join the bank merely for the purpose of acquiring business habits.

As to Spratling, he looked a harmless little fellow ; his head and hands were immense, and his shoulders broad enough for a man of my father's height ; yet he might have \"walked under my arm.

Was I quite sure I was comfortable, she wanted to know ; because, if I was not, there wras a delightful bed-room, entirely at my service, at the back of the house, and she would give orders at once for it to be got ready.

Presently the door opened and in came Conny. She gave me her hand, winch I raised to my lips. \" That is a German fashion,\" said I, rather dismayed by her extravagant blush. \"Is it V she answered, turning her head aside and looking half angry and half pleased. \" I thought it wrasn't English.\" \" The French kiss each other on both cheeks, don't they ?\" inquired my aunt with naive interest. \" The men do, and I also believe it is customary among lovers.

When Conny came in my aunt left the room. \" Pray forgive me,\" said I, \" but, really, that is a lovely little hat you have on.\" \" I am glad you like it,\" answered my cousin, looking at herself in the glass. \" All feminine attire is becoming that looks saucy.

But where is the ointment without a fly in it ? Where is the feast without a death's head ? I confess I regarded the prospect of mounting the high stool I had seen in the bank, and becoming the friend and colleague of Mr. Spratling, of the big head, and of Mr. Curling, of the cockneyfied forefinger, with little satisfac tion.

However, it was out of my power to hint at such a measure ; which I then considered a very great misfortune. I accompanied the family to church on Sunday. It was enough that I should be a stranger to get stared at. The con gregation was almost entirely composed of old men and women \u2014 I don't think I saw one young man. I must except Mr. Curling, who looked down upon us from the gallery : and, perhaps I may have indulged in a secret chuckle, wiien I thought if he were really in love with Conny, how mad he would be to see her and me bending over the hymn-book"], [134, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 124 together, and praying side by side. I didn't catch Conny looking at him once, which put me into a very good temper. The rector dined with us that day : a sober-faced, square-bodied man, who spoke in measured accents, and wore a beard. He professed to know Paris well, and asked me, in French, if I had ever dined at Philippe's, in so vde an accent, that I could scarcely answer him for fear of bursting into a laugh. I observed by my aunt's and uncle's treatment of him, that they thought him a very consider able person ; by which they paid me no compliment ; for of what worth is the admiration that can fasten itself upon a being who has nothing in the wide world to recommend him, \" but his calling ? \" Set a thief to catch a thief !

But I spared him : my idea being that every gentle man is bound to consider clergymen and women as being under his particular protection. I awoke next morning thoroughly out of conceit with myself. My uncle had asked me to be at the bank at half-past nine ; and, whilst I shaved, I reflected, with much bitterness, upon the indignity to which necessity obliged me to submit. Had anybody asked me winch I would rather be, a groom or a banker's clerk, I should have answered, a groom. Dis tressed noblemen had driven coaches, and hungry baronets had, before now, curried horses for hire. But a banker's clerk \u2014 faugh !

However, in spite of my distress, I was punctual, and got to the bank before my uncle. Mr. Curling stretched his hand across for me to shake, and asked me to step round. I eyed the counter with abhorrence, walked haughtdy around it, and having gained the other side, felt that I had raised between me and society an obstacle which nothing short of a change of name wTould enable me to sur mount. Mr. Spratling, bowing his head over his big ledger, scribbled furiously, and took no notice of me. I asked Mr. Curling if smoking was allowed on the"], [137, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 127 premises. He replied, with much diffi- dence, \" I think not.\" \"What is my work to be?\" I enquired. \" From what Mr. Hargrave said,\" he replied, \" I don't think you wid be re quded to do anything. Howrever, I presume you are here to learn the business ; and if I can be of any use to you, I shad be only too glad.\" I thanked him, and replied that it wras my wish to learn the business, and to do my share of the work. I couldn't say less. \"There is very little to be done,\" he answered. \" Our customers are a very quiet set. Most of our accounts are deposits ; and our discount business is by no means large. Market days are our heaviest time. The farmers then pay in.\" \"What do you call deposit accounts?\""], [138, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 128 \"Accounts that are left in our hands not to be drawn upon without notice. We adow interest on them.\" \"And what is interest?\" Here Mr. Spratling uttered a faint groan of laughter. Mr. Curling looked fiercely in his direction, and said, \" In terest is a sum of money adowed by us for the use of the moneys left in our hands. The rate is regulated by the Bank of England. But all these things are very simple matters : and I don't doubt that you will have them at your finger ends in a very short time.\" I must confess that he spoke very nicely; and I felt that if he would only pull that atrocious ring off his fore-finger, I might not find him so objectionable as I had feared. Nor was he so plain, now that I examined him closely. He"], [139, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 129 certainly had good eyes and teeth, and there wras a delicacy in his hands which even his ring could not deform. But his chess was very clerkly, consisting of a long frock coat, which he wore open, and a waistcoat buttoned up to his throat, scarcely showing- a spotted cotton cravat, ornamented with a pin. The back of his head, moreover, wTas a convexity of black friz. On the other hand, his voice was pleasing, and his manners sufficiently easy. Before long my uncle bustled into the bank, and on catching sight of me caded out in his cheery way, \" There you are, Charlie ! How are you ? \" and came behind the counter and shook hands. \" Now,\" said he, taking me aside, \" what I want to impress upon you is this : master the details of banking as VOL. I.

In reality there is very little to learn. The mere clerkly portion of the business is nothing ; any ploughboy could be taught it in a wreek. The banker's real needs are, a good address, thorough ami ability, a high sense of honour, and a good knowledge of human nature. You understand ? \" \" Perfectly ; and I may hope that I am not deficient in some of the qualifi cations you speak of.\" \" Indeed you are not.

But,\" he continued, clapping me on the shoulders, \" in spite of some little weaknesses, there is enough in you to persuade me that you wdl do very wTell.\" He then went into his private room. I almost forget how that day passed. I had a seat on a high stool near Mr. Curling's desk, and I remember that from time to time he would turn to explain something in connexion with the business, which, he told me, was im portant to know. He went about his work diligently and steaddy, and par ticularly amazed me by the extraordinary capacity he manifested of counting any amount of money in an incredibly short space of time.

Nor was his perception of a bad or doubtful coin less remarkable. Now and then he would stay his mha culous counting to examine a piece of money, give it a sharp ring, fling it aside, and proceed in his work like a machine. \"If I were to live a thousand years,\" I thought, \"and were I to devote twelve hours of the day to counting money, I should never be able to do what that fellow does.\" I expressed my surprise, and he asked me to try my hand on two pounds of silver.

Mr. Spratling worked like an automaton. I thought his zeal contemptible, and won dered that any human being should be gdted with so little tact as not to know how to qualdy the vulgarity of labour with an occasional dash of the gentdity of indolence. But speaking of him when he had gone out at one o'clock to get his dinner, my opinion of the youth wTas greatly improved, by Mr. Curling telling me that he got eighty pounds a year, on which he supported his blind mother, who had no other resources but her child's salary."], [144, "134 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. \" By George ! \" I exclaimed, \" he is a worthy young man ; and if I have any influence with my uncle, I'll get his salary raised to a hundred pounds.\" I don't know how it came about, but I have a clear recollection of leaving the bank at four o'clock, in a much more subdued mood than I had entered it. I was under an engagement to my aunt to dine at Grove End, but I felt so tired, after my long and unaccustomed confine ment to one room, that I begged my uncle to excuse me to her. Why was I subdued ? Perhaps because I wTas tired. Does physical weariness take the conceit out of one ? if so, here you have a reason for the change in me. I am willing to look a little deeper, and attribute it to a feeling of, perhaps, the only whole some pride that had ever stirred me \u2022"], [145, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 135 the pride of having been honestly occu pied. I left Mr. Curling still busy with his accounts, but he had told me there was no need for me to stay. I walked home to my lodgings and dined off a chop and half a pint of sherry, and then putting a pipe in my mouth, strolled out in the direction of the green lanes. I was not much of a moralist in those days, but my mood happening to be a pliant one, certain thoughts seized the opportunity to intrude themselves and beget sundry reflections. I asked myself if I was not carrying my notions of gentdity a little too far ; d I was not making a very grave blunder in conveying the impression that I considered myself too good and fine to engage in work in which hundreds of men, in every sense"], [146, "136 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. my equals, and in many senses my betters, were employed ? I enquired of my common sense whether it were possible for a gentleman \u2014 I don't say a real gentleman, for I am aware of only one kind \u2014 to lose caste by adopting any pursuit in which he could preserve his honour and possess his proper dignity securely ? Was not an assumed ignorance of the essential, if common-place, interests of life a very impertinent coxcombry ? Should I not be asserting myself as 'a very despicable kind of fop if I professed to look with contempt on a vocation of which I had not pride enough to restrain me from pocketing the profits ? I don't pretend to say that I answered these questions in a manner such as a severe moradst would approve.

I so thoroughly enjoyed the fresh air and the exquisite serenity of that May evening, that, though you may conceive I thought a good deal about Conny, I don't remember once regretting that I had not gone to Grove End. It is good for man to be sometimes alone. I am pretty certain that my solitary walk was more beneficial to me than a long evening's coquetting with my sweet cousin would have been.

I could not help taking notice of the peculiar and loving care with which her companion directed her ; and I was speculating on his aspect, which struck me as familiar, when he looked round and disclosed the features of Mr. Sprat ling.

We had no sympathies in common. He once asked me to take a wTalk with him, and I wrent ; but I passed a very stupid time. He could scarcely talk upon any other subject than business and bank rates, and stock lists and exchange prices. When by a very free discussion of my own affairs, I invited him to be equady candid, I found him excessively cautious.

He had lodgings near the bank, and out of curiosity I accepted his invitation one day to spend an evening with him. I found that he didn't smoke. He pretended to like the smell of my pipe, but I was so sure that he did not, that I put it aside, and he didn't ask me to resume it. He had only one room. His bed was up in the corner ; there were some books on the mantelpiece, and writing materials on a table near the window. He apologised for the meanness of his accommodation, and told me he had no other resources outside his salary, wiiich was the only piece of personal information that, I think, I ever succeeded in getting from him.

I rather hoped, now, that the whiskey-and water would make him more candid ; and, not without tact, turned the conversation upon my cousin. But he had one of those folding minds which, like the tubes of a telescope, sdde deftly one within another, so that, without appearing to evade me, he yet succeeded in com pressing himself entdely out of my reach.

But I am one of those people who soon get tired of natural scenery. Nothing is prettier to read about than cool glades, and sunny hay-fields, and the smed of violets, and the lazy lowing of cattle, and the metadic echo of the scythe being sharpened, and the songs of the rustics. A gentleman wid sit down in the library of his club in Piccadilly, and declare himself, amid a glowing description of rural beauties, an ardent admirer of the country, which he never explores further than Richmond. I remember some verses written by Captain Morris, which my father, who had known the author, was very fond of quoting :"], [157, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 147 \"Tour magpies and stock-doves may flirt amono- trees And chatter their transports in groves if they please ; But a house is much more to my taste than a tree, And for groves ! oh ! a fine grove of chimneys for me ! \" I say that I should have been sick of Updown and the natural scenery around it in less than a wTeek, had it not been for Grove End.

I remember one fine evening at the latter end of June, that I left the draw ing-room and stroded on to the lawn, and seated myself under a fine old oak tree. I wanted Conny to join me, and hoped she would take the hint, or that her mamma would send her with a cigar; sol as I have said, Mrs. Hargrave took great pleasure in seeing us together.

Then, throwing his handkerchief violently into his hat, which he had placed on the counter, he called out, pointing to me, \" Tom, d that isn't Charlie's son, hang, draw, and quarter me ! \" \" Why, of course it is,\" replied my uncle. \" Here, Charlie, let me introduce you to your uncle Richard.\" I went up to the counter, and my uncle Richard gripped my hand Avith a squeeze, that left my fingers bloodless. \" It is Charlie as he was at five-and twenty \u2014 but better-looking ! \" he roared, pulling me hard against the counter, and"], [214, "204 JUT UNCLE'S SCHEME. examining my face Avith a broad grin on his own. \" Come in, come in, this way, both of you ! \" called out my uncle Tom ; and then shutting the door, he made us sit down. I looked at this fresh uncle of mine with unmixed curiosity. He was as unlike Tom as Tom was unlike my father. He had a fat, broad, English face, with immense double-chins, little strips of whiskers, sharp black eyes, and a head very nearly bald. He was as tall as my father, and about three times as big. Indeed, he only wanted a pair of top boots, and a bottle-coloured cut-aAvay coat, to have figured as a liAing repro duction of the picture of the traditional Mr. John Bull. \" Of course you told me he was with you,\" said he, addressing his brother,"], [215, "JUT UNCLE'S SCHEME. 205 and by the \" he \" meaning me, \" but I should never have remembered it had I not caught the likeness.

Iioav is he ? \" \" Very well indeed,\" said I. \" Does he eA'er talk of his brother Dick ?\" \" Oh yes.\" I should have been nearer the truth had I said \"Oh no.\" \" J'm his brother Dick.

Dick was a good deal among the players and literary men of those days, and when he is in the A7ein, his conversation is very amusing.\" We jumped into the phaeton, and drove to Grove End. My aunt and Conny gave uncle Dick a hearty greeting. I confess I Avas surprised to see how completely he altered his manners when with the ladies ; how cour teous, how affable he was, how agreeably he talked. He tried to get up a laugh against me, by teding them how I had mistaken Braham the singer for Abraham"], [223, "JUT UNCLE'S SCHEME. 213 the patriarch ; but whether it was that I had my aunt's and cousin's sympathy, or that they had never heard of Braham, my big uncle's well-meant attempt missed fire. I gave him a look to let him knoAV that what laugh there w-as, wTas on my side. Conny asked A7ery affectionately after Theresa. \" She wants to be tamed,\" w7as the answ7er. \" She's groAving desperately wild.

Here's a cousin who would be glad to know her.\" I tried to catch Conny's eye, to let her know that this suggestion of her papa's was entirely gratuitous, but she wouldn't look at me. It seemed to me, however, that Mrs. Hargrave stared at her husband somewhat more severely than his innocent observation merited. \" Well, when are you coming to see us ? \" said uncle Dick, turning round and facing me. \" I shall be proud to make Theresa's acquaintance,\" I answered, the idea sud denly occurring to me that by feigning to take an interest in my unknown rela tiA^e, I might arouse Conny's jealousy. \" Name your clay, my boy.\" \" We'd settle that this evening,\" in-"], [225, "JUT UNCLE'S SCHEME. 215 terrupted uncle Tom, who then offered to take his brother to his bed-room, and afterwards show him some singular roots he had in his hothouses. So they left the room. Conny followed them, \" to wait upon her uncle,\" she said, and my aunt and I were left alone. \" Theresa,\" she observed, \" is a hand some, dashing girl, but I don't think you'd adndre her.\" \" She seems to have a very manly disposition. \" \" Oh, very ; she's all day long on horse back.\" \" She should join a circus.\" \" I confess,\" said my aunt, \" I should not care for Conny to possess her accomplishments.\" \" Oh, Conny is a thorough woman, all sweetness and tenderness.\""], [226, "JUT UNCLE'S SCHEME. 216 \" And I daresay,\" replied the gratified mother, \" would be thought by many quite as pretty as her cousin.\" \" I couldn't conceive any girl prettier than Conny.

If she has given you encouragement, I am satisfied. Conny is an honest girl, and w7ould not dream of accepting one man's attention, while her heart wTas secretly given to another.\" Here the subject of our conversation entered the room, and drove us to talk of something else. Considering Conny knew I loved her, considering, indeed, that I had as good as proposed to her, I had rather expected that she would mandest some little degree of embarrassment on meeting my eyes, that she would colour up, perhaps, when I looked at her ; in a word, that she would have exhibited by her manner a thorough consciousness of the tender experience wTe shared.

Of course I am well.\" \" You are bilious,\" she said : \" you don't take enough exercise.\" \" I am not bilious. As to exercise, I hate walking.\" \" Then wiry don't you talk cheerfully ?\" \" Because you hate me,\" I replied, giving her a ghastly look. \" I thought I told you last night that I liked you ? \""], [233, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 223 \" Liked ! \" I cried with immense con tempt, \" I had rather be hated than liked.
