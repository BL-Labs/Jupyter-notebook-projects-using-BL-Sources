My young Friend, You have often inquired the real motive for my frequent journeys to the Ukraine, as also the reasons which led me to abandon my career at an age when I was still in the full enjoyment of health and intellect. My object in doing so was the fulfilment of a promise. I went home to live by the side of a friend of my childhood whom I always faithfully adored ; who alone was my dream, my supreme joy; who filled my very existence, and could replace the whole world in my eyes. In her company I wrote my ' Society.'* I read them to her in the course of our con versations, and thus excited her interest and procured her pleasure. I have just lost that peerless friend \u2014 that idolized woman whose mind craved for knowledge, and whose heart pos sessed qualities seldom met with. After her death, I hurriedly returned to Paris, thinking that there, only, could I escape from the grief of my recollections, and, at the same time, meet with the past again. In Paris, with my beloved, now dead, I spent a portion of my youth. There, I became acquainted with the first joys, the first feverish impulses, of youth ; there, I returned every two or three years with my friend, in order to make provision of what we both called French viaticum, imparting life to our letters or conversations. By birth, she belonged to that noble * ' La Societe de Berlin ' ; ' La Society de Vienne ' ; ' La Socidte de Madrid ' ; ' La Society de Londres ' ; ' La Societe de Eome.'"], [12, "VIII PREF4_CE. faubourg* where I also have many relations, and whose inhabitants form the only society with which I am ac quainted in Paris. Besides the interest of the present, these studies will possess that of enabling me to revive a portion of the past by mixing with them some reminiscences discreetly alluded to. The withered flowers of the fragrant blossoms of yore are yet pleasant to consider ; they preserve a charm of sweet melancholy, a still-lingering attraction. These pages can only describe a limited Parisian circle \u2014 leading society, for I frequented no other. In my letters on Berlin, Vienna, Madrid, London, and Rome, my object has been to delineate the true cha racteristics of the personages \u2014 to indicate the real tendency of the ideas I was officially instructed to observe. A society we appreciate and whose life we live affords other oppor tunities. Although an observer is more acute and more penetrating when judging, so to speak, the outside of society without bias or prejudice, yet he displays more interest and earnestness when studying the elements of the society he has selected. When a man has been called upon to lead a full and active life, mixed up with the chief events of his time, and has enjoyed rest and happiness, he experiences afterwards an utter dislike for action, and an imperious desire to seek relief by leaving the busy sphere of utility, and following the pursuits of a dilettante. The meaning of the latter word has been improperly re stricted. Formerly it signified (and I here use it in that sense) a disinterested admirer of what is beautiful and good \u2014 a refined spectator of the plays performed on the stage of life. In old age that state of mind is in conformity with the natural logic of things. To this, you will reply that I am still far from being old ; but I have travelled much.

IX of my days is more than half spent. \"When a man no longer hopes, he feels old indeed. It is easier to command situations by foresight than by waiting for them. In the already distant past, when people travelled in mail-coaches, it was necessary to think of the night early in the day, and to send the courier forward to engage sleeping accommodation. Until the inevitable day comes when we shall have our own comfortable easy-chair in our club, sheltered from draughts, where, with mild cigars, the Debats or the Covstitutionnel* will be handed to us ; where attendants will offer us their arms to lean upon in going upstairs \u2014 it is wise to quietly obtain the deference of the public, to command the respect of the disrespectful youth of the day, and to secure beforehand a share of the esteem we may be entitled to from our own contempo raries. Paris offers admirable facilities for the realization of those projects ; it is the onlv city of the whole world where people enjoy most these two desiderata : freedom of life and gratifica tion of the eyes. Nil admirari might be the motto of that Parisian society I wish to describe to you, and with which you are unacquainted. Whatever occurs there that differs in the least from the ordinary rule evokes either a shrug of the shoulders or the approval of the wittiest public known. It is not the custom there to become infatuated or passion ately fond of anvthinsr ; enthusiasm and blame are discreet and moderate ; obiects of interest are soon forgotten ; English pwffism, which has been so readily adopted on the other side of the Atlantic, finds no favour in Paris. Every body may, therefore, live as he pleases in the French capital, and select amongst the various coteries to which he may belong, at the same time, the best elements wherewith to form his intimate circle. He needs have very little fear of seeing his actions commented upon, but whenever they may be, his critics will prove themselves masters in the delicate * The names of two leading French Conservative papers."], [14, "PREFACE. X art of preserving propriety in their remarks. Compared with that of Paris, the society of any other city seems wanting in tact and good taste. As for sight-seeing, the town itself is so admirably beau tiful, that when impartially judged as a whole, it conveys an impression of harmony, elegance, good taste, and splendour, such as cannot be met with elsewhere. Other cities possess districts, sites, monuments, and collections of works of art, the sight of which causes the delicate fibre of admiration to vibrate in refined and enlightened minds ; but no other capital produces a more lasting impression of that feeling, nowhere else is the symphony performed with fewer false notes and in better time. Every stone of that marvellous place relates an episode of a grand history \u2014 that of the people which, notwithstanding its faults and misfortunes, personifies most powerfully the very spirit of universal progress. Although France, Frenchmen, and Paris, like all things here below \u2014 where it would appear that everything, how ever complete and finished, has but its allotted limit of existence \u2014 are subject to the law of imperfection, tainted with weaknesses, ugliness, culpable and repugnant faults ; they may, nevertheless, be reckoned amongst the best of God's works. You are unacquainted with the society I am going to describe. It is, doubtless, more foreign to you than that of capitals where you spend but three months. Society in Paris has this peculiarity, that it is far more inaccessible to a Parisian of a certain class than to any foreign adventurer. At all events, even supposing you could have been accepted in that society, policy would have forbidden your frequent ing it. You bear a great name of Republican tradition, you serve the Government of the Republic, and could not have run the risk of being suspected of conversion to the Monarchy. In like manner, the writing of such a book would have been difficult for a Frenchman. In order to"], [15, "PREFACE.

Later on, when I live in Paris, and am enabled to observe persons and things more closely, I may, perhaps, write a book on Republican society ; in that case, you will have to furnish me with the chief elements of information, but I shall not dedicate the work to you. Paul Vasili."], [16, ""], [17, "1 SOCIETY IN PARIS. FIRST LETTER. THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. Forty years ago a child was born to the title of King of France. Will he ever bear that title ? That question is so uncertain that it seems wise not to endeavour to solve it, The Comte de Paris embraces in his claims his grand father, Louis - Philippe, and his cousin, the Comte de Chambord. He is their political heir; and in order to grasp the full bearing of the double claim thus repre sented, and the value of the two traditions, it is necessary to study the characters of those two princes, so different one from the other. Louis-Philippe was born at the Palais-Royal, October 6, 1777, of Philippe d'Orle'ans and Marie- Adelaide de Bourbon, daughter of the Due de Penthievre. His mother was a lady of refined virtue and great piety. The revolutionary and extreme views of his father induced the latter to entrust the education of his sons and of his daughter, Madame Adelaide, to the care of Madame de Genlis, who was imbued with the new ideas and followed the educa tional system of Rousseau, with the rather narrow method inherent in her sex."], [18, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. Louis-Philippe was possessed of precocious and remarkable abilities, and was an earnest student. His youth was guided by the teachings of Emile.* Madame de Genlis endeavoured to awaken in her pupils an interest in nature, taught them to study botany during long walks through the fields at Neuilly, and even imparted to them the rudiments of medicine and surgery. In the course of these studies the young Prince met with a grievous adventure, the par ticulars of which were most carefully suppressed. The j'oung men had been taught the art of phlebotomy by operating on a cabbage-leaf. One day, whilst out walking, they met a poor peasant lying unconscious under a tree. Madame de Genlis saw in this circumstance an opportunity for the practice of philanthropy and surgery. The Due de Chartres bled the poor man, who, being merely in a swoon resulting from indigestion, unfortunately died under the lancet of the young practitioner. When but twelve years osage Louis-Philippe was appointed colonel of the Chartres dragoons, and at nineteen lieutenant general. He enthusiastically embraced the principles of the Revolution, applauded the taking of the Bastille, was fre quently seen in the galleries of the Assemble'e Nationale,-f performed the duties of a steward and censeur at the Jacobin club, and, whilst garrisoned at Vendome, acted as chairman to the Association of the Friends of the Constitution.*! At the outbreak of the war, in 1792, he was in command at Valenciennes. As a volunteer at Quidvrain, he made himself conspicuous by his bravery, and contributed under Kellermann to the success of Valmy, and under Dumouriez to that of Jemappes. Visitors to the chateau of Chantilly could until recently have noticed, in a glass case devoted to the souvenirs of the Citizen- * 'Emile, ou de l'Education,' Jean-Jacques Rousseau's most famous work. f The elective assembly that followed the meeting of the States- General and preceded the ' Constituante.'

But the touching respect thus shown towards the humbler of these articles has not been shown by the members of the third generation \u2014 or at least that feeling is not yet fully developed amongst them. It is said that the young Due d'Orleans, on leaving college in a downpour of rain, was walking unprotected against the deluge, when one of his schoolfellows, the son of a nobleman well known in Paris society, ran up to the young Prince and respectfully offered his umbrella. The Prince having declined the offer, his schoolfellow insisted. ' No, indeed,' said the Duke. ' I do not know exactly why, but I ought never to carry an umbrella.' After the campaign in Holland, in which he played a brilliant part, Louis-Philippe foresaw the beginning of his dream of future greatness in the imagination of Dumouriez, who. being incensed against the Convention, had formed the project of restoring the monarchy in favour of the Prince by means of a military conspiracy. Being threatened with arrest, the two conspirators went over to the enemy; but the Due de Chartres* refused the offer made to him of a command in the army of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, and after enduring some harsh treatment at the hands of the emigres, he went to Switzerland under the assumed name of Corby. He lived there some time with his sister on the proceeds of the sale of his horses and carriages. Having exhausted his resources, he procured the admis sion of Madame Adelaide into the convent of Sainte-Claire, and entered the College at Reichenau as teacher of modern languages, of geography, and of mathematics, at a salary of 1,400 francsf a year. He stayed there eight months, corre sponding from time to time with MM. de Narbonne and de * The title of the eldest son of Philippe-Egalite, Due d'Orldans. t About \u00a356. 1\u20142"], [20, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 4 Montesquieu, who, like himself, had sought refuge in Switzerland. In 1795 Madame de Flahaut supplied him with the means of going to America. He left Switzerland with the intention of embarking at a port in the Baltic. Having met with a friendly reception in Sweden, he travelled as an observer and a tourist in Norway and Lapland. On being assured by the Directory that his family would be set free as soon as he should leave Europe, he went to Hamburg, and thence to America. He travelled in the States, and in 1799 came to Eng land, where he stayed two years, living at Twickenham with his brothers. It was then arranged, through the influence of his mother, that he should be received by Louis XVIII. at Mittau, and share the advantages of the pension paid by Russia to the French Princes ; but the intrigues of Dumouriez in favour of the Due d'Orle'ans* caused the latter to be still regarded rather unfavourably by the heads of his family. Louis-Philippe succeeded, nevertheless, in again securing the good grace of the Bourbons of Naples, and a very sincere reconciliation of all the members of the house took place on the occasion of his marriage with Marie- Amelie de Bourbon. During the time that elapsed between the latter event and the Restoration, the Due d'Orleans was called to Spain by the juntas of Seville with the view of opposing Napoleon's invasion; but at Cadiz, as at Tarragona, he was baffled in his hopes, either owino- to the action of the English Cabinet, or to the imprudence with which, in imitation of Philip V, he allowed his name to be proposed as Regent.

The Palais-Royal, which had again become the rallying point of the Liberals and of the malcontents, carried on constant intrigues against the Tuileries. The fatal measure known in history under the name of 'Ordonnances de Juillet '* hurried the course of events, and what has been justly termed the ' Comedie de quinze ans't ended at the Hotel de Ville on July 29, 1830. With regard to its foreign policy, the Government of Louis - Philippe may be summed up in these words, ' Peace at any price.' At home, the personality of the King was rather eclipsed by his great ministers \u2014 Casimir Pdrier, Thiers, and Guizot. After the death of Madame Adelaide,! tne King seems to have lost his tutelary genius and the most enlightened guide of his conduct. His part was, it must be confessed, a most difficult one to play, placed as he was between the progressist tendencies of the Con stitutional party, the determined opposition of the partisans of the elder branch, and demagogic and socialistic claims. Electoral reform was the rock on which the monarchy of July struck and went to pieces. The tardy concessions of the Government were unavailing in checking the impulse given by the Republican journalists. The Regency of the Duchesse d'Orleans was proclaimed.

Louis-Philippe was a far better man in his private than in his political life, having always through the latter played the undignified part of one actuated by petty ambition. Queen Marie-Amelie was possessed of exquisite and charming dignity, and personified grace and distinction in the midst of a somewhat 'bourgeois' Court. The Kiug prized personal merit above all other considerations, and determined to make distinguished men of his sons. He sent them to the College Henri IV., and never allowed them any special advantages beyond supplementary lessons between school-hours. It has even been said that the young Princes on leaving college actually bought fried potatoes, which they democratically enjoyed on their way back to the Tuileries. They became very intimately acquainted with many of their schoolfellows, in whom they found friends whose never-failing devotion proved advantageous in after life. The Due d'Orleans, eldest son of Louis-Philippe, was handsome, refined, and very popular, possessing as he did much of what captivates the French. In him the some what unpretentious good-nature of the Orleans family was relieved by a witty and slightly haughty affability. He had several gallant affairs, which caused much stir ; amongst others, a certain meeting on a balcony, with a nobleman intensely devoted to the Legitimist party. They both settled their political quarrel and love-rivalry then and there by crossing swords under the trees of an historic park. The Duchesse d'Orleans was splendidly gifted, highly cultured, and of a proud and firm character. She bore with dignity the troubles of her married life. She directed with a strong hand the education of her sons, though in accordance with modern ideas. The hope of their future position lay in her eyes in a very decided antithesis between"], [23, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 7 the tendencies of the younger branch and those of the elder branch of the Bourbons. She, therefore, resolutely brought up the Comte de Paris and the Due de Chartres in accordance with democratic ideas. The reconciliation that took place in 1873 had only been delayed until then through her influ ence, which had outlived her, and to that influence must undoubtedly be ascribed the liberal views of the Comte de Paris and his attachment to the tradition of the monarchy of July. The thought of the fusion sprung up immediately after the Revolution of February : it was its logical consequence. By what reason could heredity be appealed to in favour of the Comte de Paris if its principle was denied to the Comte de Chambord? There was only one way of solving the difficulty : the reconciliation of the two branches of the house of Bourbon. The adoption of that measure \u2014 the wisdom and expediency of which were beyond discussion, and which was recommended by the heads of both parties* \u2014 was, however, delayed twenty-five years. In the very earliest days of the exile of the house of Orleans, M. Berryerf- and the Due de L^vis.J on one side, and MM. de Salvandy,\u00a7 Guizot, || Pageot, Mole, and the Comte de Mornay-Soult on the other side, united their efforts to pave the way to that much-desired settlement. The AssembUe Nationale was the chief organ of the fusion scheme ; and, in a letter addressed at that time by M. Pageot to the Journal des Ddbats, the wisdom thereof was thoroughly urged. Before his death, Louis-Philippe explained himself categorically on that subject. He wished for the union of the house of France ; he admitted, however, that the action * The Legitimists and the Orleanists. f One of the most illustrious members of the French Bar, and a devoted supporter of the Legitimist party.

In a letter to M. de Barante, he even went further. Giving way to the necessities of the situation, he confessed that his grandson could only be 'a legitimate King.'* In 1853, the Due de Nemours paid a visit to the Comte de Chambord at Frohsdorf, frankly acknowledging the political bearing of his action, and, speaking in his own name and in that of his brothers, he expressed himself thus : ' I declare to you that we do not recognise in France any other royalty than yours, and that we ardently wish for the moment when the eldest member of our house shall sit on the throne.' In the following year the Comte de Chambord went to Claremont, to see Queen Marie-Amelie, and the meeting was a very affectionate one. But nothing could be done without the adherence of the Comte de Paris ; and the Duchesse d'Orleans, being engrossed by care for the future of her son, was arousing in his favour une petite vendie constitutionelle. She considered it inopportune for him to give up one of his two best chances by ceasing to be the representative of the idea of the constitutional monarchy. In January, 1857, at Nervi, Queen Marie-Amelie gave a dinner, to which she invited her nephew,f then at Parma, on a visit to her sister. M. de la Ferronnays and Dr. Gueneau de Mussy exchanged some sharp words, which were not likely to hasten the satisfactory solution. The war of 1870 modified the situation. It is necessai-y to under stand the wonderful change which took place in French public opinion during the years 1872 and 1873. 'Without accepting the worn-out thesis denouncing the eighteen years of corruption of the Empire, it must be admitted that a wind of feverish and maddened excitement was blowing * ' Son petit-fils ne pouvait etre que roi legitime.' t The Comte de Chambord."], [25, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 9 over Paris towards the close of the reign of Napoleon III. All classes of society, intoxicated with their easily-acquired fortune, rushed after pleasure. The Imperialist party, re cruited almost everywhere, composed of new men, of a few descendants of ancient families, of readily welcomed foreigners, was hastily and madly rushing along through life. That passionate rush, which was to a certain extent shared by all classes, found an echo and an aliment in all the manifestations of contemporary life. The stage, litera ture, and music contributed to keep it up. Who does not remember the quadrille in ' Orphe'e aux Enfers?'* The wild rhythm of that insane symphony seemed to invite all society to the dishevelled dance. To those notes, strangely and madly scored, the whole nation seemed ready to rise and join in the fete. After the war, nothing at first appeared to be modified. Versailles first, then Paris, witnessed anew the assembling of scattered society. There was unspeakable relief in meet- ing again, in watching the wonderfully rapid reforming of a world almost similar to that which had but disappeared. Then gradually people examined each other, and found they were different from what they used to be : the elasticity of old was strained ; the heart and mind of the nation were filled with the lofty morality that usually follows after great disasters. People now felt the necessity of sheltering themselves under principles offering security, and one fine morning they fancied they saw 'Le Monde regene're'.' Such, at least, is the title of a charming novel by M. Ludovic Halevy, in which a brilliant officer of Hussars yields both to the good sense of his mistress, who marries advantageously, and to the scruples of his cousin, who makes up her mind to remain faithful to her husband in future. He returns home and goes to sleep, sadly per ceiving that he alone is being regenerated. The joke is rather good, but the observation is correct and its bearing * Offenbach's opera-bouffe."], [26, "10 SOCIETY IN PARIS. very deep. There was at that time a sort of thirst after moral order, and that aspiration took expression in the hope of setting up again a monarchy. Which monarchy ? \u2014 so M. Thiers used to ask, with his slender, shrill and mock ing voice. Indeed, nothing was more ambiguous than the part played then by the former Minister of Louis-Philippe. Being fully bent upon gratifying only his personal ambition, he set the various parties in opposition, being certain to reign whilst they were divided. He was in turn a Legitimist, an Orleanist, a patriot. He verbally encouraged all sorts of wild hopes, whilst being resolved to gratify none. The Comte de Chambord played into the hands of the liberator of the territory:* the fusion seemed an ac complished fact, the Comte de Paris having intimated his intention of going to the Chateau de Chambord,f there to do homage to his great cousin, and seal in the former abode of Francis I. the reconciliation of the house of France. When M. Thiers held in his hands the royal message which, launched forth at that time, seemed a challenge to constitutional ideas, his joy knew no bounds. The Comte de Paris could no longer carry out his intention, all hope of a restoration was postponed. A few days after the Comte de Chambord had in ill-time unfurled the white flag, the Comte de Paris was met by the head of the executive! at Versailles, who said to him : ' By declinino your visit, your cousin rendered you a famous service.' The Prince did not reply : his position appeared to him in its true light. Seeing the progress of the Monarchical party in the Assembly, the necessity for a reconciliation became more than ever imperative. On May 24, M. Thiers resigned the Presidency, and the decisive game began. Acting upon the counsel of his most trusted advisers, the * The name given to M.

Having given up the hope of arriving at an understanding concerning his political views and those of his cousin, he preferred to avoid dis cussing the matter. Besides, the march of events fully served his purpose ; the Restoration scheme was entering the phase of almost certain contingencies, it was being carried out legally. To satisfy conscience and ambition, it was sufficient to let Fate alone, which seemed likely to betray Henri de France whilst serving the cause of Philippe d'Orleans. Such, indeed, is the irony of fate. The fusion, called ' the confusion ' by certain irreconcilable Royalists, actually took place. The Comte de Paris, accompanied by the Prince de Joinville, delivered in the drawing-room at Frohsdorf a declaration drawn up beforehand, and every word in which had been approved by the Comte de Chambord, to whom it had previously been submitted. The Due d'Aumale was unable to be present at this meet ing, being at that time president of the court-martial ap pointed to try Marshal Bazaine. 'Paris* was all that could be wished for !' said the Comte de Chambord to M. Maggiolo, editor of the Unions a fort night after the interview. It was rumoured that the deaf ness of the Prince de Joinville aroused the sympathy of the Comtesse de Chambord, who was also afflicted with the same infirmity. All the Monarchical press had struck up the Royalist ' Hallelujah.' The question of heredity to the throne being now settled, the next point was to secure the accession of the pretender. But this important game was played in the name of the Comte de Chambord by the partisans of the Comte de Paris. Therein consists the secret of the abortive result of the Commission des Neus.

At one time the certainty of success was such that the material preparations for the entry ot the king into his good city of Paris were carried on with feverish haste. Liveries, harness, carriages, everything was ordered ; the state carriage to be used for the ceremony was duly finished ; but Fate had ordered otherwise, and it was stored in the warehouse of the coach-builder until a purchaser was found for it in the person of the King of the Hellenes, who recently made use of it on the occasion of the fetes given in honour of the coming of age of the Duke of Sparta * The harness, being of Belgian manufacture, was seized by the French Customs and sold by auction. What was the cause of all this ? How did it happen that a campaign, begun under such favourable auspices, should end in so woful a defeat ? The letter of October 27, sent from Salzburg to M. Chesnelong, dealt the final blow to Monarchical hopes, by disclaiming and disowning the men who had prepared the Restoration. The fact is, the Comte de Chambord had no confidence in the skill displayed in his favour ; the absence of conditions concerning the sub mission of the Comte de Paris had already aroused his suspicion : he wanted the keys of France to be brought to him on a gold salver, with the spontaneous acclamations of the people, and a herald welcoming him with the cry of ' Vive le Roi !' instead of which, protocols and declarations were sent, the clear meaning of which seemed to him to conceal mischievous reservations. He hoped for a moment to evade these intrigues, and dreAv up the Salzburg letter, with the secret conviction that the Restoration carried out on his plans would succeed. He was anxious to pull down the pedestal of his greatness soon enough, that he might forget having used it. A detail generally unknown, and which is in itself a revelation, fully deserves mention. His faithful followers, who had witnessed his private life and grown old * Son and heir presumptive of the King of Greece."], [29, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 13 in his service, did not express the slightest astonishment at his having written the Salzburg letter ; on the contrary, the heads of the Royalist party in France, those who, for the preceding twenty-five years, had acted as his spokesmen and defended his cause, were painfully surprised ; this step of the Prince was in fact the cause that led several of his supporters to abjure their political creed. In a letter to M. E. Veuillot,* the Comte de Chambord spoke of a policy less intended to meet the true aspirations of France than to insure the success of party combinations. Those who can do so will read in this the revelation of the secret. The son of the Duchesse de Berry, sold by a Jew to a Prince of France, thought that the Comte de Paris and his entourage had robbed him of his keys and gold salver \u2014 that they had changed the true feelings of his good people. The Assembly of 1871 owed, it appears, its composition to the one fact that France, being tired of her troubles, and seeing in the Republican party but the extreme supporters of the National Defence, selected Conservative candidates as the partisans of peace. The elections of February, 1871, were a plebiscite in favour of the close of hostilities. Peace having been signed, the complemental elections plainly showed the feeling of the country to be in no wise monarchical. The Comte de Chambord's was a puerile conception : the grand style, the secret of which he had been taught by the Bishop of Hermopolis,f and the flag of Fontenoy, are wit nesses to its vague and striking magnitude, but the future will do justice to it. It will say that whereas Louis-Philippe was an unscrupulous and ambitious man, the Comte de Chambord was but a fanatical dreamer. Besides, the character of the latter is an interesting one to study.

What is a newspaper ? A pennyworth of history, too often distorted, written on a sheet of paper. The same persons, on the same day, at the same hour, in the same kiosk on the boulevard, are depicted as either grotesque or heroic, and each portrait is incorrect. It is sometimes painful to those who have witnessed events to remain impartial, seeing that so much has to be contradicted. No one ever gave rise to a legend more false, no one ever was subjected to less justifiable attacks, than Henri- Dieudonne\" d'Artois, Comte de Chambord. The ' miraculous child ' was a cipher, he grew up sur rounded by confirmed ciphers, and married a cipher. The Due de LeVis and the Baron de Damas directed his education, and afterwards remained as his advisers. The chief events of his youth were most unfortunate ; his two tutors let him, in the first instance, injure himself in a shocking manner, and, in the second, married him to a lady older than himself, of unprepossessing appearance, notoriously unable to give him issue, and whose fortune was at the time very limited. The first of these misfortunes was due to the fact of the Prince having been allowed to ride a dangerous animal. Nothing is easier than to ascertain beforehand whether a' horse possesses such means of defend ing himself as constitute a real danger. That is an elemen tary precaution which is always attended to, and which, in this case, was neglected with the most inconceivable care lessness. The horse falling on the Comte de Chambord might have crushed him. The Comte had a narrow escape, but met with a very bad fracture, which, in most cases, proves mortal ; moreover, the indecision of the surgeon who treated him, partly due to the tergiversations of the entourage of the Prince, prolonged uselessly the sufferings of the latter, and aggravated the strongly-marked claudication subsequent to that event."], [31, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 15 That infirmity did not in the least inconvenience the Comte de Chambord. When out hunting he rode a pony, generally a strong Irish cob, and took a lively interest in every kind of sport. He was especially fond of a dun coloured horse called 'Le Nain Jaune,' which Comte Mayence de Damas bought in England for the Prince, and which the latter rode for fifteen years. As for his marriage, the story of it is more grievous still, if possible, than his accident. The interest of Europe was much excited in favour of the young Prince, whose romantic birth, physical beauty and misfortunes enlisted general sympathy. Negotiations were opened in view of his marriage with a Russian Grand-Duchess. M. Thiers interfered with such skill that he brought about their failure. A wise advice, dictated by a truly enlightened and correct appreciation of the situation, then reached Kirch berg.* A Prince educated abroad, the heir (so people said) of the sovereigns brought back in the waggons of the foreigner, and driven away, it was also alleged, by the explosion of national feeling, required a French consort of ancient race, and bearing a name the lustre of which should be closely united with the ancient glories of monarchy. That lady was to be chosen from the house of Rohan or that of Montmorency. M. Thiers foresaw the danger of that resolution, and circu lated in foreign Courts the news of the numerous matri monial failures of the Comte de Chambord. The French press insinuated that the son of the Due de Berry could find no alliance with a princely, still less with a reigning, house. The vanity of the Royalists was stung to the quick, and a secret envoy of the Government of Julys was pro- * Then the residence of the Prince. f The name given to the Government of Louis-Philippe from the fact of his owing his elevation to the Revolution of July 27, 28, and \u202229, 1830."], [32, "16 SOCIETY IN PARIS. mised a considerable sum in case he should succeed in concluding a marriage between the Comte de Chambord and the Princess of Modena, whom reliable information represented as incapable of gratifying the hopes of the legitimate monarchy. The Due de Levis and the Queen \u25a0 \u2014 as Madame la Dauphine* was then called \u2014 fell into the snare thus skilfully laid for them, and respect for truth compels me to say that the heir of the Bourbons accepted a wife from the hand of M. Thiers, the irreconcilable enemy of the elder branch ! Tbe young Prince submitted to his fate without enthusiasm, but without murmur, albeit that fate was in no wise tempt ing. His childhood and his birth had been spent under the gloomiest auspices. Life at Kirchberg and at Goritz was dull to excess ; existence there was passed amidst the minuti\u00e6 of a severe Court etiquette and the scruples of a meddlesome piety. Its intellectual atmosphere was depressing to an extent seldom realised. It is easy to form an idea of the im pression that awaited the Royalist pilgrims by reading the passages of the ' Memoires d'Outretombe '-f- relative to Kirchberg. Amidst the solemn ennui of that diminutive Court, the Princess Louise, future Duchess of Parma, was the only representative of youth and gaiety. Lively, witty, full of grace and tact, she left the impression of a pretty bird in a cage, and visitors took away with them in their hearts her sweet image surrounded by a halo of sym pathetic pity. The young Prince had grown up in that dull home, amidst people whose feelings either rebelled at, or re signedly submitted to, the idea that the ancien regime * Princess Marie-Therese de France, daughter of the unfortunate Louis XVI. \u2022f A posthumous work of M. de Chateaubriand, the great champion of legitimacy."], [33, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 17 was for ever gone, and who themselves were equally power less and despondent. The Belgrave Square demonstration offered an oppor tunity for extending the limited circle in which the heir of Legitimistic hopes had hitherto lived. The windows, so to speak, were thrown open, and a puff of wind from France was allowed to blow in. Then came the two La Ferronnays, Charles and Fernand, the Marquis de Biencourt, the Due de Fitz-James, Gaston de Montmorency, the Prince de Roberg, and the Comte de Fougainville, each of them in the prime of life, full of ardour and energy, and true types of what must have been the companions of Henri IV. But for the Bearnais,* who would have handed down to us the names of Mornayf and Corisande ? The newly-arrived noblemen soon perceived, to their great dismay, that their Henri IV. had been emasculated, and that he knew neither how to drink nor how to flirt. As to whether he knew how to fight, that was possible ; but it was no easy matter to bring about an opportunity of judging; whereas, on the contrary, nothing was easier than to remind him of the practical lessons given on the first two points by his gallant ancestor. A plan of campaign was debated, and that which was selected was heroically simple. A Royalist nobleman of a very good house was married to a lady of a princely house, who, being very honest, after the fashion of Brantome, was especially indulgent towards one of the conspirators. Without hesitation, it was resolved to en trust her with the mission of fascinating the heart of the Prince, and of handing the first apple which was to dispel the timid scruples and the really too naive ignorance of the royal Adam. Her good-natured lover facilitated the experiment with a good grace worthy of a better fate. * The surname of Henri IV., from his being born at Pau, in Beam. f The virtues and scholarly merits of Duplessis-Mornay furnish at least a partial reply to this question (Translator). 2"], [34, "18 SOCIETY IN PARIS. The fair lady gave her assent, and the gallant campaign was carried out in the face of the austerity of the entourage of the Comte de Chambord. Bouquets, toasts, speeches, billets-doux, love-declarations, and advances \u2014 everything was being done in concert. At a certain moment un expected hopes were aroused ; a journey to Cy thera seemed certain. A struggle was already imminent between the passionate feelings and the loyalty of the Royalist lover, when the Legitimist Circe re-embarked with a precipitation which likened her departure to a defeat. What was the matter ? The exact truth of it never leaked out. Out of three persons who might have dis closed the secret, two had an interest in concealing it ; the third one did not speak. . . . We may vouch that that person had nothing to disclose. The Comte de Chambord lived at Frohsdorf, amidst what resembled more and more a dull, petty Italian Court. Towards the close of his life he was an old-fashioned child, solemnly delivering commonplaces with jovial good grace, but becoming despotic as soon as an idea foreign to his very narrow intellect was mooted before him. He lived in the midst of a very limited number of Frenchmen, and received frequent visits from his nephews and nieces, the children of the Duchess of Parma. Visitors from France were always welcome. From Vienna they wrote to the Comte Stanislas de Blacas, and in his absence to the Comte de Monti, who transmitted to them the orders of the Comte de Chambord as to the day and hour of their audience. If the visitor was a personage of importance, or a member of one of the families whose loyalty to the pretender was traditional, he was requested to make a stay, the duration of which rarely exceeded a week. Frohsdorf was a small mansion of rather modest appearance ; the establishment kept up was simple, though princely, in its simplicity. The stables, specially entrusted to the care of the Comte"], [35, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 19 Maxence de Damas, were kept on a more stately and gorgeous footing than the rest of the establishment. The visitors, having been received by the Comte de Blacas or by one of the noblemen on duty, were led to the study of the Prince, who having been made previously acquainted with the smallest details concerning his guests, received them as though he had known them all his life. The cordiality of such welcome gave rise to the impression that respectable Frenchmen were in their place at Frohsdorf ; that their visit there was not only natural, but expected. He spoke of the restoration of monarchy as being certain, though mysterious impediments (so he said) delayed its execution. His soul seemed fixed upon a slow and infallible course entered upon from the very first days of his exile, pursued after the fashion in which Christians win heaven, rather than that in which temporal goods are coveted, and which, he thought, was destined to make him indeed some day the sovereign of France. That prevented him from giving a precise opinion about anything, passing judgments on people or appreciating facts. He was fond of conversation, but he indulged in it with a certain intolerance which, like the Italians, he shrewdly made use of, and which always prevented him allowing a thing he did not wish to hear to be said in his presence. The experience acquired during so many consecutive years, in the course of which he only reigned in conversation, made him a master in the art, and we should not at all be surprised to learn for a fact that he acted in the same manner with his most intimate friends. Since the death of the Due de Le\"vis, it is very doubtful whether the Comte de Cham bord made use of anybody else's judgment but his own. Such is the secret of the grandiose and hardly practical immutability of his creeds and doctrines. He refused to listen, he would not hear, and the world progressed without him. Visitors were dismissed after a conversation the duration 2\u20142"], [36, "20 SOCIETY IN PARIS. of which seemed determined upon by their personal import ance; they were sometimes invited to breakfast at the Prince's table. As for the privileged persons who were to prolong their stay under the royal roof, they were expected to go to Mass. Clad in evening dress, at ten every morning they met the Prince, who, on passing, hastily saluted them, though in a friendly manner. After service, breakfast \u2014 recherche- and abundant \u2014 was served. The table, square in shape, was arranged according to the etiquette of the Court of France, one side of it being occupied by Monseigheur and by Madame, who sat on his right : those were the titles given to the Comte and to the Comtesse de Chambord, so as to avoid pronouncing the words ' highness ' and 'majesty.' The guests occupied two sides of the table. The Comte de Blacas or the Comte de Monti sat opposite to the Prince ; as for the other members of the household, the order of precedence was according to age. The Prince partook of his food with a rapidity and an appetite which enabled him to consume an incredible quantity within a very short space of time. Whatever may have been the number of guests, breakfast lasted barely half an hour, and when dinner was prolonged beyond forty minutes, Monseigneur gave visible signs of im patience. He was eating all the time ; during the short intervals when his plate was empty he devoured bread and salt. It is likely that these unwholesome habits brought on the disease which carried him off. After meals half an hour was spent in the drawing room, and then, taking leave of their guests, the august hosts retired to their apartments. Privileged visitors were admitted to private audiences in the daytime, in the pre sence of the gentlemen of the household, and at night time they met in the smoking-room. The night circle was the favour most sought for, seeing that in it a certain amount of familiarity and freedom was tolerated. The deafness of the Comtesse de Chambord prevented all"], [37, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 21 conversation with her. Though she did not ostensibly occupy a very important place in the social circle of Frohsdorf, she nevertheless exercised over it a certain influence which, in time, became all-powerful over the mind of her husband and those of his spiritual guides. The nephews and nieces of the Comte de Chambord belonged to the party of their aunt, wliich party was, secretly but actively, anti-French, and in close league to dis courage any attempt at a restoration. All who were ardent, full of ambition and activity amongst the Royalists, were held in suspicion and kept away by means of distrust skilfully aroused. In this the Comtesse de Chambord considered that she acted in self defence. She regarded with a sort of instinctive and tradi tional horror the hopes of restoration that were perpetually talked about at Frohsdorf. In her eyes, France, Paris, a throne, meant the executioner's cart, the guillotine with its blood-stained framework, a maddened populace and martyr dom. As a Christian she would have submitted to the latter ; she little cared to confront it as a Queen. This im pression had been suggested to her by Madame la Dauphine, the unfortunate daughter of Louis XVI., whom misfortune exceeding all limits of human endurance had, so to speak, petrified. All that which constitutes the attraction of life for a woman had been wrecked during the fearful upheaval of 1793, in the course of the six years of deadly solitude which followed the catastrophes of the royal family. The poor Princess, forgotten in her prison, was unaware of the extent of her misfortune. She was unacquainted with the fate of her mother, her brother and her aunt. She only saw her gaolers. It is difficult to imagine a more dreadful trial, or to conceive how the life and reason of the sister of Louis XVII. could have withstood such tortures. When set at liberty, and sent to her family, the poor creature could not understand that people could smile. Her features were rigid, blunt and masculine, her being had lost all faculty of"], [38, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 22 enjoyment. She could only forgive, and hope for supreme reward beyond this world, that had treated her so cruelly. During the closing years of her life she scarcely left an armchair placed in the recess of a window, through which were seen rows of trees so planted as to remind one vaguely of those in the Tuileries. Nothing pleased her so much as for people to affect being enraptured by the similarity of landscape. One of those little bags which your grandmothers called ridicules* hung from the arm chair. When the Duchesse d'Angouleme-f- died, there were found, carefully wrapped in tissue-paper and free from their mountings, some diamonds which had been missed for some time, and which the unfortunate Duchesse had stealthily taken from her entourage; she kept them as a provision in case of a hasty departure. The Comtesse de Chambord, whose intellect was limited, accustomed herself, by living with her aunt, to fear a similar fate, which was quite groundless on her part, her ignorance of all that went beyond the limits of the narrow circle of her life being incredible. She used all her influence to keep away from the counsels and intimacy of her husband the men who might have urged any action on his part, and took especial advantage of the painful impression left upon the mind of the Comte de Chambord by the difficulties brought about by the settlement of the succession of the Duchesse de Berry! She succeeded in arousing suspicion that the ardour of monarchical hopes was dictated by private interest ; she objected to indispensable liberalities, and used all her influence with her husband in exciting in him the fear of compromising the dignity ofhis exile by miserable pecuniary embarrassments. The fortune ofthe Comte deChambord was rather limited. * Whence is probably derived the English reticule. t The title of the Dauphine. % The Princess Caroline of Naples, the widow of the Due de Berry, and mother of the Comte de Chambord."], [39, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 23 Until the death of the Duke of Modena the total income of his and his wife's fortune did not amount to 600,000 francs* a year. The fortune of the Prince comprised his Chambord estate, as well as the interest derived from a sum of about six millions,! invested in London by Louis XVIII. at the time of the Hundred Days, and which formed the reserve of the privy purse in 1814. On the eve of the departure of the Court for Ghent, M. de Blacas entrusted the boxes con taining the treasure to Lord Yarmouth, for deposit in the Bank of England as soon as he arrived in London. An account of the journey, which was not performed without danger and difficulties, is to be found in 'The Memoirs of the Duchesse de Gontaut,' governess of the Enfants de France.! A few autograph copies of the memoirs are pre served by families allied to the house of Gontaut-Biron. Having re-ascended the throne, Louis XVIII. instructed M. de Blacas to administer the money, a portion of which he generously gave him. The principal having been in creased by the accumulated interest, its income was sufficient in 1830 to meet the expenses of the exiled royal family. The Comte de Chambord, also, inherited part of the pro perty of his aunt, Madame la Dauphine; but the liquidation of the estate of the Duchesse de Berry, and the necessity of giving a dowry to the children of the Count Luchesi- Palli, burdened his personal resources heavily. At a time when these difficulties most threatened the peace of mind of the Prince, the Due de Luynes assisted the representa tive of the Bourbons. He had a pocket-book containing six hundred thousand francs remitted to the Comte de Chambord, claiming as an honour and a privilege the right of placing his fortune at the feet of his King. The Prince acted both nobly and delicately; he kept the pocket-book of the Due de Luynes during the rather short time required * \u00a324,000. t \u00a3240,000. \\ The graceful term applied under the old French monarchy to the King's children."], [40, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 24 for the settlement of his mother's estate, and returned it unopened. Pensions were regularly paid to the former servants of the Crown, all the liabilities of the civil list were met, and although it became sometimes necessary to appeal to the purses of the Royalists in order to fulfil those obligations, they were all scrupulously discharged. The Duchess of Madrid, the Duke of Parma, and the Comte de Bardi are the children of the Duchess of Parma : the last of these was his uncle's favourite as long as he did not expose his wild youthful freaks as matters for public observation. The austere circle of Frohsdorf was hardly fitted to receive with indulgence the news of escapades too often repeated, and from that moment the Duke of Parma rose in favour. The secret intrigues of the heirs of the Comte de Cham bord, at the time of his death, led to the regrettable differences which divided the little society of Frohsdorf into two camps \u2014 that of the Princes of Orleans and that of the nephews of the late Prince. MM. du Bourg, d'Andigne, and Huet du Pavilion declared themselves in favour of the latter, and displayed a spirit of petty spite from which they derived but little honour. M. do Blacas and General de Charette, without concealing how painful to them was the necessity of making a choice, showed themselves more respectful to the last wishes of the Comte de Chambord, and gave their unconditional support to the Comte de Paris. General de Charette occupied at Frohsdorf a very special position. As the son of the Comtesse de Vierzon, one of the daughters of the Due de Berry by Madame Brown, the blood of Bourbon flows in his veins, and the devotion of his father to the royal cause in Vendee was one more reason that entitled him to the gratitude of the son of Marie-Caroline.* * Marie-Caroline, Princess of Naples and Duchesse de Berry."], [41, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 25 But the hero of Mentana was, of all Royalist personages, the contemplated chief of any attempt at a restoration ; and therefore most opposed, most objected to, amongst the faithful followers of the pretender, who had failed to become person\u0153 grat\u0153 with the Comtesse de Chambord. General de Charette is a most interesting personage. His character is a peculiar mixture of Italian finesse with the cunning of the Breton peasant, undeniable nobleness, and the failings common to all men. Physically he re sembles the Due d'Aumale ; though inclined to be rather stout, his corpulence does not interfere in the least with the vivacity of his movements and gait. A peculiarity of his is that he cannot keep at rest. He is as restless as a wild animal, and walks apartments with quick, jerky steps, and an impatience that bears proof of the physical and moral feverishness of his active nature. His conversation is blunt; he speaks either with audacity or with a reticence sometimes natural, but very often calcu lated. It is impossible to guess the true bearing of his words, so cleverly does he conceal his thoughts. His ideas are rather retrograde, though in the broadest and loftiest acceptation ofthe word. He takes a view of things from a very high standpoint, and moves in a moral atmosphere perhaps rather fanciful, though exceedingly chivalrous and idealistic. He proudly scorns all that relates to the material necessities of life, and nobly leads a more than modest existence on a small farm in the department of Ile-et- Vilaine. Mademoiselle de Fitz-James, his first wife, left him an only daughter. His second wife is Mademoiselle Antoinette Polk, whose rare beauty and noble character were fit to captivate the affection \u2014 rather fickle, so say scandal-mon gers \u2014 of the champion of the Church.* She resides on her husband's humble estate, where she receives with princely * It is well known that General Charette defended the temporal power of Rome on various battlefields."], [42, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 26 grace, charming elegance, and supreme distinction, all visitors, illustrious or humble, who call at La Basse-Motte.* General de Charette and his wife possess the rare gift of captivating hearts and winning sympathies. One experi ences special attraction towards the former, submits to his prestige, and, whilst preserving sufficient presence of mind to analyze the hero, feels it impossible to resist the power of that strange nature whose loftiness seems marred by some defects only the better to set off its rare and brilliant qualities. The Comte de Blacas is above all things a perfect gentle man, an admirable specimen of what the old families of the France of yore may still produce. He loved the Comte de Chambord, in accordance with his family tradition, out of personal sympathy, and by a sort of habit, the inevitable result of a long acquaintance. He remains a bachelor, having found the summum bonum of family affection and comfort in the home of his sister-in-law, the charming Comtesse Xavier de Blacas, nde Chastellux, grand-daughter of the author of ' Oureka.' His mind is enlightened and well balanced, though of moderate capacity. We may think that there was too much admiration and respect in the affection he had devoted to his royal master for it to be shrewd. He invariably entrenched himself behind that feeling. The Blacas are Royalists as they are noblemen ; these constitute for them two indelible characters ; and though they mode rate the expression of their feelings accordingly as political passions lose their violence with new generations, one cannot help feeling that that is a concession from them to the spirit of the time, but that they are really as ardent and sincere in their convictions as the fanatics of 1830. In this respect it ought to be confessed that they belong to a very small minority. When the room in which the mortal remains of the Comte de Chambord were laid in state was opened, to * The name of that estate."], [43, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 27 enable the faithful followers of the exiled Prince to pay their last homage to the representative of the legitimate monarchy, the Comte de Blacas, choked with tears and sobbing, fell on his knees between his two nephews. Other representatives of the great names of royal France were there. The golden book of the French aristocracy was represented within that narrow death-chamber, and the same feeling weighed upon the hearts and consciences of all present : the tacit certainty of having wasted their lives and sacrificed their youth, their talents, and their energy in vain expectation, in a hope that was not to be realized. The dream of the Royalist party was no doubt noble and comprehensible, but epic in nature ; it ended with ante-room manifestoes, and leaves a grievous recollec tion \u2014 a disconsolate regret in the heart of those who had devoted to it an attachment which lasted fifty years. Such is the succession the Comte de Paris had to inherit; and it must be admitted that he behaved correctly under the difficult circumstances that followed the death of the Comte de Chambord. He came to Vienna in the company of the Due de la Tremoille and the Due de Fitz-James, whose choice was most justifiable and dictated by circum stances, and sent word to the Comtesse de Chambord of his intention to call at Frohsdorf. There is great reason to believe that the Duchess of Madrid was the instigator of the hostile line of conduct pursued by her aunt. The Duke of Parma had fits of anger and ill-humour which proved him to be incapable of such patient and lengthy intrigues. M. d'Andigne fully em bodied the rancour and hatred of that nucleus of malcon tents. Such motives of action require a stage more vast, minds more lofty, so as to avoid descending to the level of petty meanness. The Comte de Paris did not hesitate a moment in leaving Frohsdorf as soon as he learned the order agreed upon for the ceremony at Goritz, wherein his incontestable right as"], [44, "28 SOCIETY IN PARIS. leading mourner at the funeral of the representative of monarchy -was denied him. He allowed the Comte de Blacas to make an attempt, faith in which only rested on his personal influence, to alter the decision of the Comtesse de Chambord. He failed in this, and the Comte de Paris went to Gmunden, where he made a short stay, re-entering France after the performance of the ceremony at Goritz. Since then he has evinced the broadest spirit of welcome in his relations with the members of the former Royalist party. General de Charette is one of the leading person ages of his entourage, and may be considered as persona gratissima, although the ideas he represents are not of the kind that influence the Prince's mind. Though he is respectful and mindful of the tradition and sympathies bequeathed by the Comte de Chambord, he considers them rather like factors to be treated cautiously, and which might prove useful in the event of a monarchical restoration. Philippe VII. would be willing and quite able to redeem as far as possible the faults of the Legitimist party, but he will always think and act in accordance with the principles of the monarchy of July. He does not admit of such possibilities occurring so as to justify a violation of the laws of his country, an interference with the existing order of things, or forcible intervention to modify the course of its destiny. To entertain hopes of a change of Government to his advantage, to be accomplished otherwise than by legal means, he regards as a crime, and the events of May 16* most probably incurred his un reserved disapproval, although he avoided expressing an opinion respecting the faults of his friends. He considers it his duty to remain at the disposal of France, ready to be some day, perhaps, the candidate who shall offer guarantees of security to the Conservative * The date of the abortive coup-d'etal attempted by the Cabinet presided over by the Due de Broglie, in view of a monarchical restora tion."], [45, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 29 majority of the country ; but that contingency appears to him to be subject to dangerous and dreadful catastrophes : he neither wishes nor hopes for it. In short, he cherishes neither vain hopes nor the Utopia of the Comte de Chambord, but considers he has to fulfil a strict obligation, to perform eventually a heavy under taking, and nothing else. The secret ideal of his conscience would be to spend his days in his princely mansion of the Rue de Varenne, and in his chateau at Eu, quietly bringing up his children, surrounded by his friends, occupying an unobstructive but paramount place in French society, and treating foreign princes on a footing of equality. It would be the crowning realization of his hopes to leave to his son the certainty of a similar fate ; but though, as a man, he is modest in his tastes, little enterprising and rather timid in temperament, he yet acknowledges the ob ligations imposed upon him by his exalted position and birth. This attitude is noble both in its sincerity and simplicity, at a time when the pursuit of personal interest prevails too often, and ambition hesitates so little to show itself in broad daylight. On the occasion of the vote on the Ex pulsion Bill (loi d' expulsions), and of his departure for exile, the Comte de Paris, being hurt by what was an exceptional measure, departed from the usual reserve of his speeches and writings. If, however, the expressions of his manifesto are duly weighed, it will be observed that they are really, in the main, based upon and dictated by the tendencies herein pointed out, and that the form, rather than the contents, displays the appearance of the asser tion of the claims of a pretender. There is in this a shade which will undoubtedly not escape a serious ob server. If ever the Comte de Paris ascends the throne of his ancestors \u2014 a contingency which, in my opinion, could only result from at present unforeseen public misfortunes, and"], [46, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 30 from a political or social upheaval \u2014 his government will be essentially democratic; it will, in a certain measure, draw its inspirations from English Parliamentary institutions, but, above all things, it will endeavour to become the reasonable and just expression of public opinion. His Court will be an eminently respectable circle, kept up on a footing of great simplicity. The Comte de Paris will still allow his friends to surround him, but, ascribing to them the sentiments and the delicacy he would himself experience in their place, he will little care to raise or enrich them ; he will practise on the throne middle-class virtues in a lofty way, and it may be taken for granted that, with the exception of anti religious tendencies, now entered upon the phase of action, we shall have, under Philippe VIL, a government hardly different from the present one. Political ostracism is incompatible with the Prince's nature, and many people will find their hopes strangely deceived. The Comte de Paris does not readily converse about the prospects of a restoration, and is rather inclined to make light of them. At a ball given by the Due de Bisaccia, the brother of the Comte Maurice d'Andigne having been pointed out to the Prince, the latter slyly remarked with a smile : ' That is the brother of the man who disposes of the crown of France ! He will eventually offer it to Naundorf * for want of any other candidate.' The Comte de Paris has no intimate personal friend. The reason of this is that, having been married young to a wife with whom he is in perfect accord as to tastes and sentiments, his affection has always been limited to his family circle. Previous to his departure for exile, the pretender resided * An impostor who claims to be the descendant of Louis XVII., whom history represents to have died in the Temple prison, from the ill-treatment inflicted on him by his gaoler, a heartless brute of thc name of Simon."], [47, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 31 in the Rue de Varenne, in the mansion of the Duchesse de Galliera, the whole ground-floor of which he occupied with his family. That sumptuous residence, bought by Ferrari, Due de Galliera, from the Princesse de Conde, is at the death of the Duchesse, nee Brignoles-Sales, to revert to the Orleans family. Whether as a gift or as a legacy, the conditions of that reversion are not known. The Comte de Paris did not long reside in the Galliera mansion ; he preferred to live in his chateau at Eu, where he led a life both studious and active, combining studies with an intimate and patriarchal home-life, and with all the out door occupations of a large landowner. Visitors to the chateau at Eu met there with a generous and kind welcome, great simplicity being mixed with a certain correct elegance of service and manner of life, and only a very broad etiquette, almost limited to the personal regards due to the noble guests of the mansion of the Montpensiers, being expected from the guests. The Comte de Paris paid, however, rather frequent visits to the Gal liera mansion, always staying there on his way from Randan, Chantilly, Cannes, or Spain. These visits were devoted to the granting of audiences previously solicited and arranged by his secretaries. When one sees him standing up whilst receiving his visitors in front of his bureau, one can hardly imagine how his features will come out in broad relief on coins. The profile of Napoleon III. came nearer to the ideal features required for that kind of reproduction. From his meek, enigmatical face of a dreamer, with his vague look and his lips compressed into a winning but thin smile, it was easier to detach a portrait \u2014 both classical and resem bling \u2014 of the imperator rex. As for the Comte de Paris, it would be necessary to accentuate his likeness, though vague, yet real, with the Due d'Aumale and the Due d'Alencon ; unfortunately, the Comte de Paris \u2014 horresco referens, for this is undoubtedly one of the worst cards in"], [48, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 32 the game of Philippe VII. \u2014 has all the appearance of a German Prince. He does not, indeed, resemble one of those ' Durch lauchten,' or Serenissime Highnesses, so plentiful in Germany, who come to Paris, there to squander gaily the surplus of their quarterly incomes, and seem more or less faithful specimens of the Baron de Gondremarck of the Vie Parisienne* He looks like a Prince of high lineage, but nevertheless like a German Prince. Many suggestions have been hit upon to Frenchify the appearance of the pretender \u2014 with or without his beard, a long or short imperial or moustache, dressed by a London or a Paris tailor, the appearance of the Prince remains unaltered. His like ness with the Mecklenburgs.f of whom there is no trace whatever in the Due de Chartres, reveals plainly the fact that the mother of the heir of the Comte de Chambord was a German Princess. Superficial observers will fail to detect this in his way of expressing himself; but, to the ex perienced ear of a cosmopolitan, a slight shade of ultra precision in the choice of his words and in their pronunci ation betrays his foreign origin. It is, however, scarcely marked, and still less noticeable since the Prince has resided in France. The Comte de Paris is tall ; his gait is still young ; he carries his head slightly on one side. His welcome is kind and affable : he rises to receive his visitors, and shakes hands with them with a firm and cordial squeeze. His look is straight and frank, like that of an honest man, bent on moral dignity. These two last words may sum up the observer's first impression. The Prince's visitors feel that they are in the presence of one of those men who fulfil their part or submit * A light and fashionable periodical to which M.

There is nothing of the royal adventurer in his quiet blue eye. His bureau, filled with books and papers, is that of a diligent and patient student, and the erudition he has stored up, the remarkable competence he possesses in all questions related to social law and political economy now engrossing public opinion, doubtless prove that the Comte de Paris has devoted his time to something else than dreams and projects of restoration. The Comte de Chambord was always concocting some new plan to regain possession of his ancestral throne. It is probable that the future biographers of the Comte de Paris will not have to point out the chimerical, mysterious, and puerile combinations that occupied the leisure of the host of Frohsdorf as having been the cause of the ambitious endeavours of Philippe d'Orleans. The latter occupies his time in a more profitable way. His conversation is agreeable and learned, without pedantry. It gives evidence of a great anxiety on his part to increase his knowledge, though it is marred by a certain dulness and heaviness suggestive of his German origin. He likes to exhaust a subject before dismissing it, and frequently proceeds with a regular cross-examination of the persons with whom he is conversing, as to the special knowledge they have acquired in their various careers or occupations. Thus, he will speak merely on agricultural topics with a country landowner, military art with an officer, administra- tion with a public official. He is not of a quick and luminous mind, but his intellect is enlightened and practical.

The Comte de Paris seeks and asks for the advice and judgment of all around him, being in this the true antithesis of the Comte de Chambord. He is anxious to enlighten his own judgment, and encourages full freedom of speech in his friends. His sense of rectitude leads him to seek the light most conscientiously, and to place much mistrust in preconceived ideas. He has much sympathy for England, though none for the high English aristocracy. He appreciates as much the institutions on the other side of the Channel, as he is little desirous to become the centre of attraction of visitors belonging to London society. He followed that line of conduct as long as he lived in England, studying minutely the working of the laws and customs of the country, and especially all questions relating to the working-classes, and mixing but very little, and but seldom, with society, in which he has formed no intimacy. He shares, perhaps, the opinion of the Marquise de l'Aigle, nee Sartoris, who, some years ago, expressed herself with rather blunt frankness concerning her countrymen. Speaking to a young French lady who doubted that on the other side of the Channel society could be less well behaved than in Paris, she said : ' My dear, if you knew as I do the sort of life led by society in England, you would see that it is impossible to be more brutally disso lute.' The Comte de Paris is not accustomed to express his feelings in that manner, but it is quite possible that he secretly shares that opinion. He might have formed a friendship with the Prince of Wales, and the Queen of England, who professes the most sincere affection for the Princes of Orleans, anxiously desired that that intimacy should exist ; but seldom were two natures more incompatible and different in tastes, habits, and feelings. They agree only in politics, and it is said that the Prince of Wales, being reproached by his royal mother with his little sympathy for"], [51, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 35 the Comte de Paris, replied : ' Friendships cannot be crammed down people's throats.' Since I wrote ' La Societe de Londres ' for your edification, the future King of England has become still more master of mundane sciences, confidant of the peccadilloes and petty scandals of society, protector of fine arts, and especially of cliorographic and dramatic arts. He now lives on such terms of familiarity with his entourage that, once closeted in the smoking-room, there is no longer question of either highness, prince, or subjects, but simply of Wales, Macduft', Sykes, Carrington, and such-like, in full enjoyment of each other's society. He tolerates from those rather numerous privileged persons such latitude in their behaviour towards him \u2014 quoting one instance out of a thousand \u2014 that one of them having received from the Prince a late invitation to dinner, wired the following reply : ' Won't come. Lie follows by post.' It is difficult to imagine the Comte de Paris in such a circle. The exquisite correctness of his manners, his concern for morality, the elevation of thought and propriety, which latter feeling is to him like a second nature, could not associate with it. Besides, he has but little gaiety and natural cheer, and only puts aside the stiffness of his manners in the unrestraint of family life, when he is often seen to play with his children as would a very affectionate and well-beloved elder brother. He works regularly from six to eight hours daily, without, however, shackling himself with strict routine. He is always ready to share the sportive recreations of the Comtesse de Paris, and displays therein a goodly average skill and knowledge. He is a good shot, and a very correct horseman ; he is not, however, passionately fond of hunting and it is doubtful whether he would have written to his young wife according to the style of his ancestor : ' Madame, the weather is very cold, and I killed six wolves.' He would have something else to say to dispel the weari ness of a separation, and that would be written in excellent 3\u20142"], [52, "36 SOCIETY IN PARIS. French. His literary work comprises the impressions of his journey to Syria and Lebanon, an essay on trades unions in England, and a paper written a year after the abrogation of the exile laws,* at the request of the president of the Committee instituted to inquire into the regulations relative to the working-classes in England. The latter was a compendious and voluminous risumi of all the works published in the United Kingdom on the condition of the working-classes, to which the Prince had added his per sonal views on the opinions of their various authors. This contribution from the Prince is a remarkably deep and impartial study of the practical and material points likely to throw light on the great social problem of the question of the working-classes. The patient researches which that work necessitated, as well as the comments, full of moderation and practical wisdom which it contains, do certainly the greatest honour to the character of the Comte de Paris. In the course of his writings the author displays great reserve in expressing his own opinions. As a rule, he generally confines himself to stating facts and drawing their logical deduction. In the concluding part of the work I have, however, noticed the following lines, which sound very much like a manifesto : ' It is by the points I have just studied that England, strengthened by her institutions, respecting the past, scrutinizing the present, and meeting with manliness the problems of the future, appears in all her wisdom to those who judge her without prejudice or infatuation. If, in those grave and delicate questions she gives the example of a truly reforming policy, that is neither revolutionary nor routine-like, it is that, on the one hand, she endeavours to increase with liberty the responsibility of individuals by striking out, as far as practicable, all preventive measures from her laws \u2014 and that, on the other, the most humble * The laws enforced by the Empire against all the members of the Orkanist family."], [53, "THE COMTE DE PARIS AND HIS LINEAGE. 37 of her citizens is well aware that the strict respect of the law by all is his only guarantee of liberty.' The style of the work is good and very logical, though sometimes rather heavy and commonplace : one would wish for a little less syntax and a little more fire and originality in it. Even when the royal writer justly tries to arouse the pity of Europe for the unfortunate and undeserved fate of the Christian sects of Lebanon \u2014 when he points to Syria oppressed by the Turk, Damascus a prey to terror, and Beyrouth laid waste, the subject is not treated by his pen with fiery eloquence. His style lacks warmth, and the elegance displayed therein, as also the generosity of in tention, are the only praiseworthy points in a rather too exclusively literary work. The history of the American war is a work of greater value, seeing that the Prince witnessed the majority of the events he relates : his style derives more warmth and in terest from the recollection of what he saw and did ; besides, the rather narrow form of the doctrinaire* school suits the calmness and impartiality required in historical researches. The most remarkable feature in the produc tions of the Comte de Paris is the conscientious pains taken by their author. It is a fact that he works to the best of his ability, without either hurry or discouragement. His talent is medium, but his will uses to the best possible advantage the faculties God granted him ; and he displaj^s a spirit of criticism and strict assiduity in every subject he studies.

SECOND LETTER. THE COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. It is no easy task to furnish details concerning the lady whom the Royalist party considers as the future Queen of France. Happy are they who have no history ; and this might be truly said of Isabelle d'Orleans Montpensier, Comtesse de Paris. She was brought up at San Lucar; and when very young married her cousin, for whom she felt the liveliest sym pathy, and whose position as head of the house of Orleans rendered him a most suitable match for the daughter of the Due de Montpensier. The Comtesse de Paris loves her husband and her children with the tenderest affection. She is a model domestic wife, only bent on pleasing her husband and leaving in the minds of her numerous children the sweetest recollection of their early years. From her childhood she has been accus tomed to the patriarchal manners of the house of Orleans. Louis-Philippe much admired English family life : he appreciated peculiarly the love of their homes and the very personal care displayed by young English wives to secure the comfort of their husbands and children. That sym pathy was the result of his early education. The eighteenth century ended in strong reaction against the dissolute ways of the reign of Louis XV., a reaction begun under the in fluence of Jean Jacques Rousseau, of whom Madame de Genlis was one of the most ardent supporters. There is, there fore, no wonder that Louis-Philippe should have become infatuated with the ways of the English middle-class. It is necessary to have lived over the Channel to grasp fully the utter divergence existing between the ways and manners of the Anglo Saxon race and those of Latin races. That divergence is so strongly marked, that one cannot reconcile"], [55, "COMTESSE DE PARIS .iND THE ORLEANS F_.MIL Y. 39 one's self to English ideas and manners without differing essentially from the tendencies of a French circle. In England, family tradition is preserved to excess. The son will be what his father was before him, and follow in his footsteps : his conduct will be guided by the ideas in which he was brought up ; he will follow them most tena ciously. Thus the English middle-class lives in the strict observance of moral and religious laws. Cant, or hypo crisy, is an inexcusable vice, which mars those virtues. In the eyes of children who have grown up in those austere circles, respectability is the beginning and the end of all ambition, and they do not conceive any other view of life. Political conscientiousness and a spirit largely Liberal and Conservative at the same time, are the prominent qualities of the aristocracy ; excessive brutality of manners is the objectionable feature in that class. The eldest son of a lord, being accustomed from his earliest age to ill-use his dog or his pony, to see his father sleep daily after dinner over port or claret, would, of course, not dream of any other existence than butchering an allotted number of God's dumb creatures, as if to gratify some extraordinary mania of destruction, to partake freely of the good things of this life, and, from time to time, to steer the ship of state. The peculiar feature of these institutions is that, whilst preserving faithfully the tradition of family ideas, every child but the eldest \u2014 who is to be one day the appointed guardian of those ideas \u2014 is taught from the earliest age to know that he will have to make his own way in the world, and has nothing to expect from his relations. His parents must give him an education proportionate with their fortune ; nothing more. It is very common to see the offspring of a titled and wealthy house start in life with the smallest means, and find himself, in that respect, on a footing of strict equality with the son of his tailor. The sense of independence and of personal dignity developed"], [56, "40 SOCIETY IN PARIS. in the rising generation is the happy result of that way of looking at life. It is the chief element of British great ness. There is, however, some compensation in the province of sentiment for whatever harshness and hardening such theories produce in the heart. This compensation exists in domestic life, in that circle of warm affection which consti tutes an English home. Such affection is evinced by a wise management of all that relates to material life, as also by the preserving of the serene moral atmosphere in which children grow up. English women are domestic wives in the lower classes, and ladies in the upper classes. The first of these terms need not be explained ; the second is derived from an old Saxon word which signifies ' bread-giver.' The mistress of an English home is, in fact, the true dispenser of the bread of life, of affection, the bread of the heart, and of bodily food, that is, of all personal ministering to the material welfare of those whose happiness is dependent on her. In many cases, the music heaped on the piano, the books scattered on the furniture of the room used for family meetings, bear witness to the literary, artistic, and studious tastes of the mistress, a good portion of whose time is also spent in the kitchen, where she prepares with her pretty hands dainties intended for her dear little ones. A large room is occupied by a large bed, close to which is placed the baby's crib. Intimacy is the rule and the custom ; the lord and master of the house only has his dressing-room on the first-floor and his study on the ground-floor ; between his wife and himself everything is in common. The wife lives under the protection and by the work of her husband, as the latter lives by her vigilance in household matters and her indefatigable love. Such is the ideal English home, on which is framed and copied that of the Comte de Paris. The Prince lives as completely and as openly with the"], [57, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 41 Comtesse as a city merchant does with his wife. Although the Comtesse de Paris does not consider it as part of her duty to visit the kitchen, she otherwise lives like an English lady of the middle-class. She calls her husband unceremoniously Philippe or Paris, even when she speaks of him, and says ' thou ' and ' thee ' to him in all circumstances. Their intimate life is exactly similar to what I have described above, and there is no doubt that their mutual conjugal bliss has never been on the wane, that no really deep outward sympathy, however ephemeral and fortuitous, ever occupied the imagination of that model couple, and that the blue sky of their domestic felicity was never darkened by any cloud. A rather amusing anecdote is related in support of this. The Comtesse de Paris was, for a short time, attended by a maid of honour, belonging to the best society, and, in many respects, quite worthy to fill that position ; she was, how ever, an old maid, and rather indignant at the fact. She was doomed to celibacy on account of slender fortune and family reasons, and that state of too great perfection was revolting to her somewhat exalted and romantic nature. Once entered on her new functions, she took an extreme liking to, and developed an affectionate interest for, them, and eventually became enamoured of the Comte de Paris. She played earnestly, though not with equal success, the part of Rosen's Colette in ' Les Rois en Exil.'* Having vainly tried to impress on the object of her passion how great and sincere was the love he disdained to accept and return, she resolved to bring about one of those occasions in which the most steadfast virtue must some times fail. Under some pretext or other, a fire having broken out, or one of the young princesses being ill, she contrived so as to induce the Comte de Paris to enter her room without mistrust, and received him several times in a dress purposely disarranged and seductive. The Comtesse de * A capital satire on modern royalty by M. Alphonse Daudet."], [58, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 42 Paris noticed those man\u0153uvres, and affected to regard the matter as a joke. She treated that delicate theme with so much grace and frankness, she railed so meekly with the feeling of superb security that a woman, certain of her husband's love, can alone display, that the whole romance ended in a fit of laughter. The unfortunate maid of honour had to join in the fun so as to avoid becoming thoroughly ridiculous, and had to pretend that she counten anced a most innocent joke, rather foolishly invented, to cheer a monotonous winter. The Comtesse de Paris is fond of cheerfulness, and prizes very much a witty conversation. She likes to be amused, and is one of the few persons of royal rank with whom conversation is both entertaining and attractive. Indeed, in the course of such conversations, etiquette requires that visitors should confine themselves to answering questions, and avoid saying anything but in praise or out of compli ment. Those restrictions do not contribute to give interest to conversations, and it is a fact worthy of notice that witty people and brilliant talkers get over these ordeals a great deal worse than those who are less gifted in that respect. Indeed, seeing that the latter need not observe so much restraint, they are in full possession of their faculties, whereas the absence of freedom paralyzes the former. The Comtesse de Paris possesses the talent of keeping within the strict bounds of propriety, which she does with infinite charm, owing to her unassumed kindness, the shrewdness of her mind, and the genial manifestation of her inward satisfaction. She takes hardly any trouble to please people, and does not indulge in vain and polite phrases ; she is essentially natural, with a slight touch of bantering humour and a certain brusqueness. People in her presence must appear cheerful and free from care ; she laughs heartily at the least witticism, and does so without a shadow of malice. She directs the conversation as she would drive a four-in-hand led by mettlesome ponies."], [59, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 43 She goes straight to the aim in view without any ostentation. She performs all she does with amusing assurance and in really intelligent fashion, and if she were a little prettier and a little more graceful in her demeanour, people might consider her very prepossessing. _ But, whilst giving her a fine and royal carriage, nature did not enrich her with its most precious physical gifts. Her nose is long ; her eyes small and rather too far apart ; her mouth is large, though adorned with beautiful teeth, disclosed in frequent smiles ; her hair is cut in fringes in almost every direction, and she wears it plaited simply at the back. This way of dressing her hair seems more practical than pretty, and was evidently adopted because of the taste of the Comtesse for horsemanship and sport. When out visiting in the evening, or at the theatre, her dress is sumptuous though not recherche ; she dons a ball- dress and puts on her superb diamonds without the slightest concern for either elegance or feminine coquetry. It is easy to perceive that those are details of veiy slight importance to her, and that she little cares what effect she produces. The whole performance seems rather wearisome to her ; she lends herself to it with a good grace from a spirit of duty, but it often occurs that she seems to wish for the end of the play, reception, or party. In the morning her dress is very plain; she prefers English and rather masculine shapes, a widely-plaited skirt, a jacket, and a turned-up collar, with a gentleman's necktie and pin, with a large pearl. Previous to her exile, this was her favourite dress in the country, and even in Paris in all circumstances where it was possible for her to maintain that stiff simplicity without attracting too much attention. Thus, as a rule, the Princess receives her visitors with the same dress in which she goes out in the morning. When ever she changes it for a more befitting dress, she assumes one of a dark shade and free from trimmings or fancy-work. She is passionately fond of horses, is an excellent judge"], [60, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 44 of them, and rather proud of her knowledge of horse manship. Tn fact, she is a good rider, although she does not sit very gracefully on her horse, but displays more daring than science and skill. When out hunt ing, she shows great experience in that kind of sport. Without being a consummate hunter like the Duchesse d'Uzes, she feels interested in the run of the hounds, gives her advice with sagacity, and follows the hunt with the measured spirit of those who are aware of the inconvenience of allowing their horses to carry them too far. But shoot ing is her greatest passion ; her cynegetical tastes are those of a real sportsman. She delights in going straight before her, alone with her dog, and is by no means afraid of broken ground. She prefers game that protects itself, and she has often been heard to complain of the great battues of the environs of Paris, which resemble a farm-yard slaughter. Albeit, she takes a brilliant part in it, and although she is wont to shoot rather hastily, her score in the hunting-book is always heavy. Her shooting costume is a regular gentleman's suit \u2014 knickerbockers, a nominal skirt, jacket and cap to match. This costume is not graceful, though quite business-like. In her mansion at Eu she seldom failed to devote some hours of the day to sport, and her daughters imitated her with remarkable spirit. In the summer, at dusk, she went to shoot rabbits on the outskirts of the underwood in the park, always in the company of several of her children. The young princesses are extremely fond of their ponies, feed them with bread in the stables, and, for their age, ride very fairly. The Comtesse de Paris repeats to everybody that she likes neither dancing nor dress. 'Art and sport \u2014 such are my favourites,' she says, with a laugh. ' I prefer, a hundred times, a fine horse to a fine diamond.' Such tastes and habits often deprive women of grace and distinction ; on the other hand, they add to their simplicity, energy, and"], [61, "CO4MTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 45 genuineness. This is somewhat the case with the Comtesse de Paris. But the dignity of her rank, the moral elevation of her character, the circle in which she lives, will always preserve her from becoming vulgar. Moreover, she possesses a very deep and just feeling for art in all its manifestations, owing to a natural taste as well as to the thorough study she has made of it. I have referred to the Comte de Paris as a writer. The literary tastes of his wife are of course subordinated to the sympathies of him who fostered and developed them. The Comtesse de Paris likes moderate ideas, expressed in the academical form of the doctrinaire school. The vanguard of younger authors obtains from her rather limited encouragement. She sees the danger of boldness of thought and style rather than the hopes that may be built on exclusively personal talents, freed from the fetters of esthetics composed entirely of old-fashioned formulas. She therefore looks upon that class of literature with natural sympathy, albeit toned down with the distrust with which she has been taught to regard it ; yet she often, half in joke and half in earnest, takes up the defence of the new school ; but she treats very scornfully the intended coarse ness of certain writers, and belongs to the class of readers who insist upon being respected at all costs. Apart from her literary tastes, she is fond of German music and French sculpture. The talent of M. d'Epinay and that of MM. Dubois, Chapu, and Mercie arouse her enthusiasm. She paid frequent visits to their studios, and displayed the most judicious taste and the most enlightened judgment in her observations. In painting, her ideas are most classical. She speaks of it with more reserve, and her admiration is rather attracted by the conventional and neat productions of certain artists in repute. What a delightful living specimen of a fresh and candid beauty the Princesse Amelie is ! She is a handsome person in the full acceptation of the term, and gifted with timid"], [62, "46 SOCIETY IN PARIS. and exquisite grace. She was a truly charming royal ingenue when she quitted France for Portugal, and she left a recollection of affectionate regret to all her entourage. Her features recall those of the Comtesse de Paris, though they are more regular ; but the dazzling freshness of her Complexion, her magnificent head of hair, and her figure, admirable in its development, still incomplete, make her a lovely creature whom it is impossible to behold without admiring. Her education has been refined, but not modelled after the modern tendencies embodied in the curriculum of univer sity studies. The Princesse Amelie has been brought up in accordance with the traditions of 1830, with the addi tion of the English language. She has more practical and sportive knowledge than the majority of the young ladies belonging to the best French society. On the other hand, she possesses in the highest degree the habits of reserve and faultless bearing held in honour in society of old. Her youth has known but few distractions. She never attended any social gathering previous to the grand ball given in her honour by the Due de Bisaccia on the occasion of her eighteenth birthday. On that evening the Hotel de la Rochefoucauld sheltered the elite of French society : the young Princess danced the cotillon with the Prince Charles de Ligne, brother to the Duchesse de Bisaccia, and at supper \u2014 a fact which attracted general notice \u2014 the order of precedence was scrupulously ruled by rank. In society, agreeable compromises, based sometimes upon the vain susceptibility of the guests and sometimes upon the per sonal sympathies of the hosts, are generally indulged in. Although it is hard to prevent altogether rivalries of that kind, they are, however, avoided as far as possible by draw ing up beforehand the list of invitations. The presence of the Comte de Paris served as a pretext for putting in force the old ceremonial. On this occasion the small fry were treated as such, the younger sons were relegated to the"], [63, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND TIIE ORLEANS FAMILY. 47 background, and all the old-fashioned duchesses saw their rights duly acknowledged and respected. You may fancy the noise all this must have aroused amongst the petty members of the nobility. The marriage of the Princesse Amelie was concluded somewhat after the fashion of fairy-tales. The Duke of Braganza had repeatedly said that he would only marry a very pretty woman, and all the princesses the royal matrimonial-market offered to the heir to the throne of Portugal were far from possessing the required appear ance. The Comtesse de la Ferronnays, the widow of the faithful friend of the Comte de Chambord, stopped in Lisbon, in the course of last winter, whilst visiting the Peninsula. Being received at Court she foresaw, with her penetrating intellect, the very probable success of the negotiation she had in view. She telegraphed to Paris to have a fine portrait of the Princess sent to her ; and so managed matters that the Prince, whilst paying her a visit, noticed the portrait and admired it. That portrait brought about discreet praises of the charms of the daughter of the Comte de Paris. Nothing more was needed to induce the Prince to mention his intention of visiting France shortly. Was he already in love with the portrait, or was he smitten under the gorgeous ceilings of Chantilly ?* The fact is, there are few matches in which the suitability of position leaves room for as much mutual love. And yet the dear Princess wept very much on her depar ture. The storm, which was about to burst and doom her father to fresh exile was already gathering its dark clouds on the horizon, and the uncertain future of her family still increased the sadness of a separation. She found pleasant words and gracious expressions to thank all those who * The former residence of the Princes of Conde.

It must be confessed that there is unspeakable sadness in the hunted existence of exiled princes. In his fine novel, ' Les Rois en Exil,' Alphonse Daudet studied those princely troubles. He shows the slippery pavement of the capital betraying the weak morality of the King of Illyria, until, having gone through all the degrees of degradation, he commits without hesitation a still lower and baser action, whilst, by his side, his wife, in her haughty ambition, is not afraid of sacrificing Herbert de Rosen, and forgets that she is a mother, not merely the mother of a king. And, when her maternal heart awakes at the sight of her wounded child, is it not in order that she may better understand the ruin that has overtaken her : moral falls, material poverty, mis fortune following after misfortune, the shock that upsets thrones, shaking even cottages ? Apart from the exaggera tions required to bring interest to a certain pitch, there is, indeed, much truth in that poignant novel. Last year, the ex-King of Naples, on a visit to the Due d'Aumale, was examining an album containing views of the various residences occupied by the Prince \u2014 Claremont, Twickenham, Chantilly, Nouvion were represented in it. The King was struck at the neatness of those reproductions, and said very simply : ' In order to keep views of the places where I stayed, I should have had to get photographs of the various hotels of Europe.' This remark fell with un speakable melancholy in the midst of these so-called fortunate ones of the earth. A couple of months after the Comte de Paris was exiled. The law of expulsion was aimed chiefly at the Due d'Orleans. What future may not, indeed, have been re served to a Prince brought up in France (he attended the lectures of the free-school* in the Rue de Madrid, where he * A non- government school (ecole libre)."], [65, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 49 was making brilliant studies), having friends and comrades in all classes of society ? France might have easily become infatuated with that fine youth. The Due d'Orleans much resembles his grandfather, whose title he bears ; there is, however, more vivacity and gaiety in his manner ; exile overtook him preparing his examinations. He completed his classical studies in England, and will shortly begin a special military training under the superintendence of a general officer attached by family tradition and personal affection to the princes of Orleans. This officer, whose name discretion prevents my mentioning, though still young, has retired from active service in order to devote himself exclusively to the educa- tion of the son of the Comte de Paris, and there is no doubt that the tutor is in every respect worthy of the pupil. The young Princesses, Helene and Louise, are two lovely little girls, fair, and very, perhaps somewhat too slender and delicate. Their soft, frizzly hair surrounds their pretty faces, and a straight fringe encircles their foreheads ; their large pointed guipure collars make them look like the little Infantas painted by Velasquez. In these two pretty creatures there is somewhat of a consumptive look, as of races whose blood, being too old, requires crossing with that of younger races. Their blue eyes are intelligent and searching, and the careful solicitude of the Comtesse de Paris delays as long as possible the time when they shall begin serious studies. On the Eu estate they lead a regular country life, being never so happy as when in that fine residence, containing all that afforded them innocent amusement : farmyard, aviaries, hounds, and ponies. Prince Ferdinand is a fine baby, who will be four years old next August. The Comtesse de Paris being extremely fond of children, this last one was very welcome. Follow- ing the example of the Queen of England, she suckled all her children herself ; her rare energy and uncommon health enabled her to fulfil those duties without in the least inter- 4"], [66, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 50 fering with her ordinary occupations. She has been seen to suckle her child in one of the gamekeepers' cottages, so as not to interfere with its feeding hours, and thus not ceasing to indulge in her favourite pleasures. She watches over the most minute details of her nursery, and brings up her children after the style of an English middle-class lady, taking care that nothing shall be neglected in the way of proper training to ensure their welfare and promote their health. The little Princesses and Prince Ferdinand attend mid-day meals. Shortly before the evening meal, the Princesses alone are allowed in the drawing-room, and put to bed as soon as dinner is announced. There has been a question of an intended match between the Prince of Naples and the second daughter of the Comte de Paris. This is rather premature news, considering the age of the Princess. Besides, how would such a match be looked upon by the ultramontane portion of the Royalist party ? It may, however, be argued that, in a few years, that portion will have become a nonentity. The ideas of Monseigneur Dupanloup* and of the Comte de Fallouxf have made many proselytes since their eloquent apostles have been slumbering in their graves. At the present time the talent and the personal influence of M. de Mun are almost all that is left to keep up the popularity of the doctrine of which he is the self-appointed defender. In Rome they have grown rather tired of simple mortals who fail in docility, and M. de Mun has precisely assumed the attitude of a lay archangel strenuously opposed to hierarchy. Yet his personality ought not to be overlooked ; an orator possessed of such brilliant talent is a power and an ornament to a party. His speeches attract to the Palais-Bourbon! \u2014 the galleries of which are always full, and yet empty, in a certain sense \u2014 a thoroughly select public, which goes there * The famous Bishop of Orleans. f Whose Memoirs were recently published.

However, there is no dissembling the fact that the wind does not fill his sails ; and perhaps a match between the daughter of the representative of the most Christian Kings and the grandson of Victor Emmanuel will some day be welcomed as a pledge of enlightened liberalism. Do not mention these delicate political questions to the Due de Chartres ; he will pretend not to understand them, and will bow systematically to the authority of the Comte de Paris in such matters. ' Having the good fortune,' so he declares, ' of being his junior, I do not meddle with them. When my brother speaks, if I share his views, I am acting the part of a flatterer ; if my opinion is contrary to his, I am acting that of a rebel. All that I know is how to command a regiment.' Tall, slender, and of a sallow complexion usual with fair people whose existence has been passed in the open air, the Due de Chartres possesses, in the highest degree, military smartness. He is of a fiery temperament; he inherited the impetuous passions of his father, and although he is scrupulously respectful of outward decorum, his private life is full of little incidents which recall the adventure of the balcony, in which his father was the hero. Yet the remark of a charming lady about the trifling infidelities of her husband might be applied in the case of the Due de Chartres. ' My husband,' said that indulgent wife, ' may give his heart to others all day long, provided he brings it back to me every night.' The escapades of the Due de Chartres are of no more importance than those which brought about that remark. When commanding the 12th Chasseurs, he was in his element, and beloved by all under him. The Duchess resided at Rouen, and entertained with the greatest affability 4\u20142"], [68, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 52 the subordinates of her husband and their families. The Prince superintended the least details relating to the comfort of his troops, and had numerous improvements made at his own expense in the cavalry barracks, to ensure the health of his men and the facility of the service. Affable, obliging, always disposed to make himself agreeable to those under his orders, and, at the same time, knowing how to enforce obedience, he left at Rouen an imperishable recollection in his brilhant regiment. The Due de Chartres is a thorough Frenchman, and has the spirit and chauvinism of a true soldier. Full of initiative and gaiety in action, he possesses the intelligent fearlessness and cheerful intrepidity which made the reputa tion of the French army. Everybody knows how gallantly he behaved in America, and how, during the Franco-Prus sian war, the descendant of Robert le Fort showed himself worthy of his glorious name before the enemy. It seems strange that the Government of the Republic should have thought it indispensable for its security to deprive France of the services of one of her most distinguished superior officers. If one were allowed to ascertain the real causes of that decision, one would perhaps discover that the measure taken against the Due de Chartres was grounded on the fact that the son of the Due d'Orleans was very eclectic in his behaviour, and had won the sympa thy of a personage who gave much umbrage to those who had succeeded to him in power. On a New Year's Day, France received the news of his death as a gift, doubtless a sad one in the eyes of many enlightened patriots. If that personage had had time to write his memoirs, he would have alluded to a certain intimate dinner which took place sometime in the spring of 1881, when the heir-presumptive of a great Queen, the Due de Chartres, three noblemen of high rank, and . . . Gambetta, met at the same table. As soon as the latter was dead, an ostracism, concealed under various pretexts, was carried out against all those"], [69, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 53 whose merits he had detected, and, strange to relate, the Due de Chartres was amongst them. The word 'Liberal' is used in France with much thoughtlessness ; if really under stood according to its correct signification, a great man would stand in need of no other epitaph. The Due de Chartres dwells in the mansion built by Prince Demidoff in the Rue Jean-Goujon, the garden of which extends to the Cours-la-Reine. Formerly the Duchess gave every Saturday parties which were much patronized. Fairly pretty, she is gracious, lady-like, well informed, and of a serious turn of mind, taking a delight in sharing the occu pations of her children. She superintended personally the education of the Princess Valdemar of Denmark, and of Prince Henri, who seems to have inherited all the superiority of mind which is characteristic of the house of Orleans. His tutors have the greatest esteem for him. He is said to combine the manly qualities of his father with the rare literary talents of the Due d'Aumale. The Due de Nemours is a Prince of very fine bearing ; he is the living portrait of King Henri IV. If the Bearnais could alight from his bronze steed in order to associate with his present descendants, he would heartily give the accolade to his nephew who bears the title of the house of Armagnac. As soon as he was old enough to form an opinion, the Due de Nemours acted in opposition to the democratic ideas of his father. The Due d'Orleans made fun of them rather sceptically, but his brother felt hurt by them, and he showed it by his words and acts. He served brilliantly in the army, and bitterly regretted being compelled to give up a career which he was passion ately fond of. On his return to France, he took no longer any interest in politics, as soon as the act of fusion, which he had so much contributed to bring about, was accomplished. He then accepted the presidency of the society of aid to the wounded of the land and naval forces, and in this capacity discharged with the greatest zeal"], [70, "54 SOCIETY IN PARIS. duties which brought him in constant relations with former brothers in arms, and gave him the opportunity of displaying active solicitude towards the soldiers of France. He has a generous and chivalrous nature ; his exquisite manners are those of the ancien regime. He speaks to ladies with that shade of respect that is so becoming, and the tradition of which is rapidly disappearing. He is not known to have had any love intrigue. A certain un realizable passion for a beautiful Princess, descendant of the Jagellons, has, however, been talked about. For many years it was entirely open to that lady to become Duchesse de Nemours. She is occasionally seen in Paris, where during her short stays she allows her faithful admirer, as a special favour, to accompany her in her rides to the Bois de Boulogne. Corisande and Henriette * were more indul gent towards their lover, but who knows whether the proto type of the Bearnais prefers not his dream to its realization ? There are people in this world, though not many, it must be confessed, who give a willing ear to the song of the blue bird of their fancy, and do not listen to that of others. We should not be surprised if the Due de Nemours were one of those few. He has two sons, the Comte d'Eu and the Due d'Alen con; the former married the Princess Imperial of Brazil, and the latter the Princess Alix of Bavaria, sister of the Empress of Austria and of the Queen of Naples. His eldest daughter is the wife of Prince Czartoryski, and lives at the Lambert mansion in the practice of fervent piety and great charity. It was at first intended that the Princesse Blanche should marry the Due de Chaulnes ; the Prince de Ligne became, however, her accepted suitor. Either of these matches would have gratified the Due de Nemours, who wished his daughter to contract a union which would have enabled her to live near him. The delicate health of the Princess 0 Mistresses of Henri IV. of France."], [71, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 55 was an obstacle to these matrimonial projects, and it is most likely now that celibacy will remain her lot. But the truly enigmatical and interesting figure, the only one which stands out most prominently of all the members of the Orleans family, is that of the Due d'Aumale. Louis- Philippe, who was a good judge in the matter, built great hopes on this son, when the latter was but a child. An insurmountable timidity only cast a certain shadow over his brilliant qualities. The first time he had to go round the drawing-room at Neuilly in order to greet the guests, he performed his task, though with visible embarrassment. He held nervously in his left hand a fold of his trousers, whilst he uttered in a fitful manner the complimentary phrase, which had to be modified for each visitor. The Due d'Aumale inherited the property of the Prince de Conde. The dark tragedy of Saint-Leu is still surrounded with mystery. My opinion, based on an impartial appreciation of facts and characters, is that the Prince de Conde died a violent death, but that the outrage was committed by mean inferiors, without its having in any way been connived at, still less participated in, in high quarters. It is certain that the guilty parties reckoned on a reward, and that the calumnies which this event gave rise to made it imperative to hush up the matter, thereby bringing at least impunity to the perpetrators. But compli city did not go beyond, and all that has been alleged on this head belongs to the untruthful fabrications of party spirit. I will not here relate the well-known exploits of the military career of the Due d'Aumale in Africa, but will remark, by the way, that he excited the utmost enthusiasm, and generally delighted those whose toils and dangers he shared. In their correspondence, Saint-Arnaud* and Lamoriciere,t whose testimony cannot be doubted, represent * General, afterwards Marshal de Saint-Arnaud, well known for the brilliant part he played in the Crimea. f Chiefly known in relation to the expedition of Rome."], [72, "56 SOCIETY IN PARIS. him as being anxious to forget his exalted rank in the presence of the illustrious commanders of the army, intrepid before the enemy, and the first to give the example of discipline. Who does not remember his brilliant feat of arms, the taking of the smalah of Abd-el- Kader, immortalized by the brush of Horace Vernet ? It is rather a matter of surprise that, on learning the news of the Revolution of July, in the course of this first campaign, the Due d'Aumale should not have yielded to the temptation of placing his sword in the scale so as to cause it to fall in favour of the political fortune of his house ; he was un doubtedly advised, and even urged, to do so. He, however, abstained from interfering, and did not try to restore the prestige of the fallen monarchy by means of his rising fame and of the reputation he had won with the army. He passed through France quietly to meet his family in England. At the time of the repeal of the law exiling his family, his military grade was restored to him. He assumed then and there such a paramount position in the army that public opinion grew accustomed to consider him as one of the men likely to be entrusted some day with the national destinies. Had the Due d'Aumale been possessed of initiative and ambition besides the personal qualities he is endowed with and the means of action at his disposal, he would have mastered the situation and directed events at will and in accordance with the dictates of his political conscience ; he only required to adopt a line of conduct in that sense and to follow it unrelentingly. In like manner as he abstained to draw the sword in 1848 in support of his father's cause, he allowed his course to be shaped by events, and served France apparently without any mental reserva tion. I use that adverb purposely, for I fancy that the ghost of the Citizen-King* sometimes came to whisper in the ear of his son that the race of the Dumouriezs was not yet extinct, and that Charles X. was still alive in his progeny. * King Louis- Philippe."], [73, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 57 How, then, are we to explain the disinterestedness of the Due d'Aumale ? Is it because he did so much to raise Botticelli* in public estimation, because he rescued the memory of Bronzino-f- from unjust oblivion and discovered Theurdank in Germany, that he proved himself unequal to the part he might have played ? There is a very minute and delicate shade between a man of action and one who, however splendidly gifted otherwise, has none. That shade may be rendered by the following axiom : a dilettante never could become a conqueror ! WThen a man has studied, read, and observed much, long watched the manifestations of the human mind in the diverse fields of art and litera ture, he is led fatally to profess a philosophical and rather selfish contempt for the facts of outward life ; as one gets accustomed to idealize, so one loses the faculty of realizing. The mind of the Due d'Aumale seems too free from pre judices, too eager for refined sensations, to have preserved the brutal objectivity of ambition. He could not leave the high intellectual sphere where he delights, or descend from the Sinai where he dwells, in order to assume resolutely the personal direction of the affairs of this sublunar world. These arguments enable me to understand how it is that, though still living, the son of Louis-Philippe has become convinced that his name will be handed down to posterity as that only of a collector and an academician.! A poor glory, no doubt, for a Prince who seemed quite fit to make his mark in history, and who narrated the Battle of Rocroi\u00a7 in a style that led to suppose he would have been able to * Botticelli Alessandro Filipepi, Florentine painter and engraver.

It is easily imagined what line of conduct Louis-Philippe would have adopted under similar circumstances. After the Salzburg letter,* he would doubtless have turned to his advantage the ambitious plans thus baffled, the abortive schemes, and begun afresh for his own benefit the campaign that had so miserably failed. The Due d'Aumale confined himself to the exercise of his command at Besancon,-f- wherein he displayed the highest military ability. It is reported that, having no faith in ambition, he pursued the realization of a more easily tangible dream in a certain flowery and perfumed path that reminded him of the sweet spring of life. There the hero of La Smalah! fondly rested from his present fatigues whilst relating his past dangers ; and seeing that a deity cannot be without a shrine, it is said that the princely admirer had one erected to the object of his worship in the Plaine Monceau.\u00a7 It is further reported that, as Louis XIV. is said to have coveted Chantilly, so care has been taken that the place should vividly recall his memory, and that the noble owner of that princely residence wished to follow the example of the great King when he resolved to fix still more firmly, by a secret yet sacred tie, a tender affection to which his heart had grown accustomed. The Due d'Aumale is now of a cheerless disposition, and free from illusions. His welcome is cold, his thin smile seldom distends his lips when he speaks, and the impres sion he gives is that of scepticism carried to the extreme. Not very long ago, in the course of a conversation with one of his colleagues of the Academy, he related the discovery he recently made in family papers of a letter from Dumouriez * By which the Comte de Chambord lost his only chance of ascending the throne. -j- As commander of the 7th Army Corps. t From his having captured the camp, or smalah, of Abd-el-Kader. \u00a7 A district of Paris close to the famous park of that name."], [75, "COMTESSE DE PARIS AND THE ORLEANS FAMILY. 59 to Philippe-Egalitey* in which the General besought the Prince not to vote the death of Louis XVI. ' That letter is very fine,' remarked the Due d'Aumale, ' and full of winning eloquence.' Then he added, quite unconcerned, ' However, my grandfather did not allow that to alter his decision.' A rather cool remark. Grief is commonly said to render people kinder and to increase their compassion. Yet the Due d'Aumale has been to the hard school of misfortune, and his paternal heart received terrible blows. His eldest son, the Prince de Conde, who died in the course of a voyage round the world, was a remarkably handsome, intelligent, and refined young man. His second son, the Due de Guise, was carried off by scarlet fever, two years after the return of the Princes of Orleans to France. He seemed rather dull and material : he Avas in no wise pleasant in appearance or remarkable for his intellect. Two other children died at an early age, and the Due d'Aumale has now no family left. He centres all his affection in the Comte de Paris, and, it is said, in the Due d'Orleans ; but Providence, which seems to favour persistently the younger branch of the house, has, it ap pears, endowed the son of the Due de Chartres with rarer qualities than those of the heir of Philippe VII. ; and the Due d'Aumale might some day become aware of that fact. The donation of Chantilly and of its collections to the Institute of France greatly surprised public opinion. It is not improbable that, being obliged to confess to himself, not without some regret, the failure of the various aims he had in view in the course of his life, the Due d'Aumale decided to insure stability and serious chances of outliving him to the only work he ever brought successfully to completion. The restoration of Chantilly, complete as it is but for some details of small importance, is indeed one of the finest artistic achievements of our time ; and the collections of paintings, arms, books, and manuscripts contained in that * The father of Louis-Philippe."], [76, "60 SOCIETY IN PARIS. superb residence deserve to go down to posterity as a testimony of the enlightened taste of the Prince who brought them together. His sound judgment secured for the Due d'Aumale a large share in the direction of the modern artistic movement. His dictates are the law ; and for the works of certain masters formerly disdained, which he drew from obscurity, their weight in gold is now paid, because of the admiration the Prince professes for them. He restored to fame several of the early Italian masters, and contributed to bring into fashion eighteenth-century portrait painters. The Vierge of Orleans is the gem of the Chantilly galleries. The Stratonice was formerly regarded as one of Ingre's* masterpieces ; but now that picture seems cold in its conception and tedious in its correction. The series of the portraits of the members of the house of Conde\" seems to me the most admirably interesting portion of that collec tion of masterpieces ; and the windows of the chapel, representing the children of the Constables de Mont morency, constitute the most marvellous specimens known of the art of glass -painting in the sixteenth century. THIRD LETTER. WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAT BE LIKE. I have already pointed out to you, my young friend, what will be the probable tendency ofthe government ofthe Comte de Paris. I lay stress on the adjective probable, for the reason that nothing is more delicate than to prejudge such matters, and rest one's conclusions on data of so intricate a nature. Similar restriction applies to what will be the composition of the Court of Philippe VII. The first question that occurs to one's mind is this : Where will the King reside ? * A great French artist. -f- One of the chief State dignitaries under the old French monarchy."], [77, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 61 The disappearance of the Tuileries, burnt down by the insurgents of the Commune, and whose ruins have been removed since, leaves a gap in the series of palaces con stituting the Louvre. The residence of Queen Catherine of Medicis * stood opposite the structures erected by twenty successive generations, and acted as the complement indis pensable to the symmetry of the whole, seeing that the Cour du Carrousel is unfortunately not in a line with the Champs-Elysees. The rebuilding of the Tuileries will be the necessary consequence of the restoration of monarchy. In the meantime Philippe VII. would reside at the Pavilion de Fiore or at the Elyse'e, although the latter supposition is highly doubtful. The chateau of Eu would still attract the Comte and Comtesse de Paris, and remain their favourite residence. On ascending the throne, Louis- Philippe did not desert Neuilly ; his grandson would follow his example. The Citizen-King kept a relatively small establishment ; it is highly probable that the Comte de Paris, rejecting the traditions of the old regime as well as the showy pomp so dear to Napoleon III., would form his Court on the same footing as that of his grandfather, where the military element was but thinly represented. Besides, the Comte de Paris has already expressed him self very clearly on the subject. One day at table some young and ardent supporters of the Royalist cause ex pressed the hope that the restoration of monarchy would bring about a change in the present spirit of the army \u2014 a reaction against the democratic ideas that now obtain universal favour \u2014 adding that the most efficacious measure to secure that result would be the revival of crack regi ments. Every guest having expressed his opinion, the Comte de Paris, half joking and half in earnest, said to them : ' It strikes me, gentlemen, that you go a little too quick with the work. What about frock-coats ?'t That * For whom the Tuileries were built. f Like his grandfather, the Comte de Paris cannot bear uniforms, whether civil or military ; his favourite dress is a frock-coat."], [78, "62 SOCIETY IN PARIS. remark quite cooled down the would-be musketeers.* It would be a great mistake to suppose that the military institutions of the present Republican Government would be maintained under the monarchy of Philippe VII. Thoroughly conversant with all questions of political and social economy, the Comte de Paris, during his residence in America, was struck with the vast and fertile field offered to human activity in the United States and the various South American countries. He sees clearly that the already redoubtable competition of those young nations with the Old World in the agricultural market cannot fail in a near future to extend to the industrial market, and that our mills and factories will have before long to contend with the importation of goods of Transatlantic manufacture. The reduction of the expenditure of European nations, by their ceasing to burden their budgets with ruinous charges, therefore seems to him of vital importance for the future of European society. The cost of the stupendous arma ments of late years, and of keeping up a formidable and expensive war-material, cramps the finances of European countries, and hinders their Governments from devoting their efforts and resources to the development of national wealth. The day will come when that inevitable and fore seen competition will cause in the Old World an industrial and financial crisis such as never was seen, and it will be difficult to weather the storm, except for those who are even now preparing for the struggle. The diplomacy of Philippe VII. will thus endeavour to diffuse that doctrine amongst European Cabinets. The unpopularity with which it would at first be received in France will in no wise alter the resolution of the Prince. But what will be the practical result of that doctrine ? It will surely be no easy matter to secure the shutting-up of Krupp's works by the mere mention of the mills of Chicago * As is well-known, the musketeers (mousquetaires) formerly com posed the body-guard of the French kings."], [79, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MA Y BE LIKE. 63 and San Francisco. The Comte de Paris will find it very difficult to persuade the Berliners to adopt his views. However much opposed one may be to military pageant, one cannot deny the right of the army to be represented at the Court of the Sovereign. Besides, the French army reckons amongst its most noted leaders many officers whose devotion to the Royalist cause is an open secret. The self-denial of the men who serve their country without restriction, master their political convictions and feelings, and give to the Republic the loyal support of their devo tion, is of all qualities that which commands most respect. Such men are numerous ; but seeing that they consider as a peerless privilege the right of serving France, I will not take unfair advantage of what has come to my knowledge to fathom hearts and consciences, and will therefore abstain from naming the three general officers with whom the Comte de Paris is in constant intercourse. At all events, the selections of Philippe VII. will be made in a broadly liberal spirit. Like Louis XVIII., after the Hundred Days, merit will pass in his eyes before political faith. It will be a more easy matter to speak of the composition of the civil household of the King, and I even fancy that the Comte de Paris will be glad to learn what are the views of a foreigner on that subject. I doubt whether he has any settled ideas on that point, and were his restoration to come off to-morrow, he would, as I am inclined to suppose, have to sit up all night in order to draw up the list of appointments. His character is the very opposite of chimerical ; he j udges from existing facts, and only troubles himself with solutions rendered indispensable by the events of the time being. Before entering the royal residence we must, however, examine the personages who would be entrusted with the duty of steering the ship of the political destinies of France. The Due de Broglie is perhaps acquainted with the"], [80, "64 SOCIETY IN PARIS. secret of the Comte de Paris; at any rate, he failed to discover that of handling his constituents, and M. Papon taught him a lesson in that respect by carrying his seat at the last elections. Though the Due de Broglie is well known \u2014 perhaps too much so \u2014 as a politician, few people are acquainted with his private life. He is very absent, and yet extremely witty. He usually rubs his hands together whilst repeating ten times over the same mot, mentally following the wanderings of his thoughts without hearing his own words. He rouses suddenly, and utters in concise and blunt language a cutting and sneering opinion that quite silences his hearers. He is a matchless solilo quist. It may be questioned whether he ever conversed really with anybody, except with ladies, whom he considers as pretty talkative birds, only fit to rest statesmen from their toils. He gets acquainted with their little intrigues, laughs at their pretty sins, and enjoys mundane society much after the fashion of an academician witnessing a Punch and Judy show. He does not share the admiration professed by his father for the sex. The late Duke lived at a time when women evinced much interest in the conduct of public affairs, and his mother-in-law, Madame de Stael, was one of the politicians of her day. I purposely use that term ; for one must be quite ignorant of the true character of the authoress of ' Corinne '* to ascribe to her ways which she never possessed. She never had but the feelings of her sex. The Due de Broglie has a very refined intellect, more remarkable, however, for its culture than for its compass. There is no connection in his ideas, no stability in his principles, and his judgment is often marred by prejudice. He speaks the fine language and writes in the lofty style of Bossuet, but lacks the deep-seated convictions of the great bishop, who, from his pulpit, rated society in the language * ' Corinne, ou l'ltalie,' one of the best known works of Madame de Stael."], [81, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 65 of Demosthenes, which he used in the scathing fashion of an ascetic. The Due de Broglie is a formidable opponent on the benches of the Opposition ; witty and caustic, his words hit and leave their mark. He is conversant with the routine of public affairs, and his great competence in all questions of foreign policy supplies him with dangerous weapons in debates wherein the attitude of a Parliamentary group adverse to the men in office may bring about diffi culties of the gravest kind. But he is not in his element when a member of the Government ; he will always jeopardize the prospects of a Cabinet that too unre servedly depends on him. Unlucky Phaeton ! he drove the Septennate to the quicksands of official candidature, and, although no civil outbreak followed his action, he miserably got himself into an inextricable muddle, and lost the game so rashly begun. That sorry adventure of his Administra tion taught him no lesson ; at least, no profitable one. He believes with imperturbable good faith that France can no more dispense with the services of Broglie than he with ruling her, and nothing ever startled him more and better convinced him of the subversive tendencies of the modern spirit than the slow, but irremediable, divorce that took place between his constituents and himself. After his defeat at the poll in October, 1885, he became deputy and Minister in partibus ivfidelium \u2014 a most appropriate term indeed ! And now he saves the country daily either in his mansion of the Rue de Solferino or at the Club de I'Union, in the Boulevard de la Madeleine. Every evening from five to seven he may be seen sitting at the fireplace of his club. Speaking alone and rubbing his hands, he hears people conversing around him, without, however, paying any attention to what is said ; suddenly he rises with his back to the mantelshelf and delivers extempore a speech, thanks to the polite deference of the attache's of embassy, much to the candid astonishment of \u20223"], [82, "66 SOCIETY IN PARIS. the junior members, and to the amusement of others. The speech is a long one, but it attracts few fresh hearers, and the company dwindles down gradually. The Comte de Paris will doubtless make the Due de Broglie his Minister of Foreign Affairs. Notwithstanding all his shortcomings, the noble Duke will certainly be able to address European Courts in the King's name ; but in order to become a Gortschakow, for instance, one must necessarily inspire the utmost confidence in the Sovereign, and I have reasons to believe that the more initiative the Due de Broglie will assume, the less of it will be left him. He will soon cease to be a 'persona grata, and will be replaced by a less inventive and more docile tool. Whilst casting his horoscope, I see pretty clearly, in the misty future I speak of, the noble Duke returning to private life in compliance with the wishes of his royal master. He will thus resume his favourite occupation of denouncing treaties and discussing protocols at his club, regretting his study at the Quai d'Orsay,* as he does now his seat and the plat form of the Chamber of Deputies. The Due de Brosrlie has four sons, the eldest of whom is the very type of mental mediocrity, trained to a certain degree of intellectual worth by a system of education cramming to the utmost. He was brought up to be a wonder \u2014 in fact, he is a real champion of academical com petitions ; is as strict on principles as Thomas Diafoirus himself, and never invented a new sentence. His charming wife, the Princesse de Broglie, nee d'Armaille, happily for the Prince, affects to be quite blind to his defects. Having realized the mistake of his educative system, the Due de Broglie did not apply it so strictly to his younger sons, Princes Aniede'e and Francois, with the result that their nature was allowed unrestrained development. Military servitude and magnificence might be the motto of Prince Amedee. Intensely fond of his profession, he * Where the French Foreign Office is situated."], [83, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MA Y BE LIKE. 67 subordinates everything to his ideal conception of the duty of serving his country. He is a handsome young man, rather cold and melancholy in appearance, yet most sym pathetic when you have ascertained how much sensitiveness and intelligence is concealed under his rather ironical in difference and stiff politeness. He married Mademoiselle Say, the daughter of the millionaire sugar-refiner ; and the chateau of Chaumont, purchased shortly after their marriage, has been splendidly restored, thanks to the prosperity of the sugar trade. The mausoleum of Cardinal d'Amboise has been thoroughly patched up : it is even reported that, with the pious view of preserving the remains of his Eminence, they have been steeped in burnt sugar ! The Princesse Amede'e de Broglie is a kind and amiable lady, yery charitable, and full of exquisite charm. She would be pretty were it not that she is a little too stout, which rather spoils her features and figure. She has a sweet and drawling voice, is most affable, and, by dint of much simplicity and kindliness, tries to be forgiven being so wealthy \u2014 an old-fashioned scruple as time now goes ; but the kind and prepossessing lady of Chaumont Manor does so with much good grace, the evidence of rare delicacy of heart, for which she is rewarded with ever-growing sympathy. The Prince Fra^ois de Broglie is also in the army. He was betrothed to a young lady bearing one of the illustrious names of the empire ; but the intelligent couple, having mutually ascertained that their characters disagreed, were sensible and candid enough to confide to each other a secret, no longer mortifying when confessed by both. The match was thus broken without any difficulty, and in the most amicable mannei'. Would people had always as much sense ! There would be many more happy matches, and the latter would be more happy still, if people paid more attention to the mysterious attraction of hearts and natures, which can alone curb under the same yoke two 5\u20142"], [84, "68 SOCIETY IN PARIS. souls, one of which must necessarily be subjected to the other. As a characteristic of the house of Broglie, it may be observed that the noble Duke, seeing how unusual an incident that was, desired that the whole matter should be settled in accordance with diplomatic precedents. It was agreed to deliver certain sentences in the presence of a select and limited public. The father of the affianced bride called on the appointed day and hour at the hotel in the Rue de Solferino and began his speech. . . . But he was so much affected that he got confused, . . . and stopped short. The Duke himself concluded the interrupted speech and replied to it. The pride of the house of Broglie was safe ! A year later the Prince Francois married Mademoiselle de Dampmartin, a bright, intelligent, and witty young lady, graceful, without any affectation, whose lovely eyes are always smiling. With such qualities the Princess soon becomes a favourite, wherever her swift fancy of happy and darling wife takes her. She is passionately fond of her husband, and goes into raptures over his sense, without being aware that she displays quite as much sense herself by pointing out that of the Prince and causing people to admire it. She is one of those women who prize success in society only when obtained through the man they love, having the natural conception of the wonderful law of sentiment, according to which prodigality of the heart constitutes its very richness. That remark, as applied to a woman, may induce the belief that the treasure is wasted. Not so in the present instance, for although the Prince has something of the external appearance and turn of mind of his father, and seems harsh, cold, scornful, and absent, he possesses real warmth of feelings ; he is kind and amiable, and has not allowed the pursuits of politics and ambition to harden his heart. What a fine thing it is to be in the army ! Duty is so plain to a soldier. He drills his conscience to obey orders and discuss none, and has"], [85, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII.

What a blessing to be enabled to remove from the horizon of one's thoughts the awful query, the redoubtable unknown evolved tty these three data \u2014 conscience, will, and action. The Due d'Audiffret-Pasquier was nicknamed rather un flatteringly by M. Thiers, ' Un hanneton dans un tambour.'* There was a certain amount of truth in that remark, though it was M. Thiers who was the drum. The great statesman was wild at the noble Duke havinsr stirred an Orleanist agitation whilst the irascible little old man was enjoying the grand situation he had chosen for the close of his life, that of ruler of France. It is said that there is a day and an hour when fortune awaits at his door every politician, who meets or misses it as the case may be. There is much chance in the fitness of circumstances to men. The Due d'Audiffret-Pasquier was once very near playing an important political part. He thought he could be the most Legitimist of Orleanists : bring the Comte de Chambord back to Versailles by means of the tactics of the Comte de Paris and the support of his followers, become on the morrow of the restoration the most Orleanist of all Legitimists and sole master of political events, and remain the indispensable man, the factotum of the Government. But too much skill will sometimes cause as much prejudice as awkwardness, so the scheme failed. The Duke is a malcontent ever since ; having missed greatness, he is somewhat disgusted at his disappointment. It is cruel to be betrayed by one's star when being so near one's object, and the compensation afforded him by his election as life senator did not appease the regrets of the would-be Monk of the abortive restoration. The Due d'Audiffret is a speaker of great talent, brought * A chafer in a drum."], [86, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 70 up according to the sound traditions of French oratory. He belongs to the school in which a vast erudition and complete classical studies formed the basis of the teaching of politics. He is a man of refined culture, an earnest bibliographist, and a most learned collector ; he has, un fortunately, the defect of being passionate and headstrong. His moral nature, so splendidly gifted, would have gained proper balance had it possessed some of that somewhat ironical stoicism so dear to really strong minds as soon as they have confronted the misfortunes of life. As it is, he is full of bitterness ; his temper has become peevish and sulky, and the least cause now makes him aggressive and melancholy. It is doubtful whether Philippe VII. will ever place the Due d'Audiffret-Pasquier at the head of a Ministerial department. The only important negotiation he ever was entrusted with proved a complete failure. It is a pity to begin life with a failure, seeing how many chances there are to finish it that way. The Duke is probably intended to occupy eventually some presidential chair \u2014 very likely that of the present Senate, which, in case of restoration, will exchange its name for that of House of Peers. The charming Duchess, who is the most pleasant-looking of elderly ladies, will be just the lady to give parties in the gorgeous salons of the Palace of Luxembourg.* Her mind is kind and refined, her amenity, based on austere virtue, is full of winning grace, and she has the talent of toning down, with charming tact, the bad effect produced by the bluff and sullen ways of her husband.

MAY BE LIKE. 71 is the favotmte residence of the Duke and Duchess. Their numerous family grow up happily with them. At the windows there may be seen the pretty faces of lovely babies with plump and rosy cheeks, and fair heads of hair all disarranged. The Duke has ten grand-children, four of whom bear his name ; the others belong to the Imecourt and Neverlee families. The Marquis Denis d'Audiffret-Pasquier is one of the secretaries of the Comte de Paris : he is a young gentleman full of medium qualities; indeed, everything is middling with him : height, ability, intellect, and conversation. History will in vain prepare its burin. It is very doubtful whether the Marquis will ever do anything worth recording for future chroniclers. He married Mademoiselle de Largentaye, a pleasant lady, though of rather cold beauty. The Marquise d'lmecourt is the eldest daughter of the Duke. She is not very pretty, but amiable and graceful, and is much liked by her contemporaries, a privilege also shared by her sister, the Comtesse de Neverlee. Neither of those young ladies inherited the intellectual tastes of the Duke \u2014 a fact which may induce the belief that by being too much of a pontiff, one loses the pleasure of making proselytes, even amongst one's own people. The Marquise dTmecourt is the cheerful member of the family ; of a merry and winning disposition, he will always be met with pleasure at any period of his life. At eighty years of age \u2014 provided he live as long as his grandfather \u2014 he will kiss the hands of the daughters of the friends of his youth, whilst composing for them madrigals quite as pretty as those he formerly wrote for their mothers. He has in herited tbe traditions of the eighteenth century as well as the virtues of the nineteenth, in which true love, it is said, has merged into badinage, and is only to be found in marriage.* The Comte de Neverlee married the Duke's * L'amour . . . s'est perdu dans le badinage pour se retrouver dans le conjungo."], [88, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 72 second daughter, whose name is Nicolle, just like Moliere's servant. He is the brother of the brilliant Comte de Neverlee, who met with a gallant death on the heights of Avron during the siege of Paris. He served likewise in the navy, where he is still dearly remembered, and should war break out, his plucky tars will again see him at their head. M. Buffet is well known, and all the persons who have been brought in contact with him preserve the most pleasant recollection of that thoroughly good and learned gentleman. He is tall and ill-looking, but his kindly smile always brightens his face. He has a shrewd mind and is a studious worker ; he seems always to believe that there is still plenty for him to learn on everything and from every body. He is quite free from self-conceit and vanity, does not readily venture to give his opinion, is thoroughly conscientious, and always anxious to do good. Though possessed of rare competence in all administrative and financial questions, M. Buffet is not what the English term a leader of men. He is an admirable assistant, but could become neither a Gladstone nor a Disraeli. I have heard it said that his conversation is most fascinating. I had no difficulty in ascertaining that his chief quality consists in being a wonderful master in the art of listening. When you speak to him an intelligent and kindly smile brightens his face ; with one word he rouses interest by manifesting his own in the most courteous way. The very few words he generally speaks are worth speeches to his hearers. That is the secret of the high estimation in which he is held by the public with respect to his art of conversation. M. Andral is regarded as one of the most prominent members of the Orleanist party. A consummate jurist, and one of the lights of the bar and of the Conseil cl'Etat, he will most certainly fill one of the highest situations in the Government of Philippe VII. Sparkling with wit, his eyes scrutinize his visitors with waggish persistence, and, as it seems, with a rather impertinent shrewdness. As"], [89, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 73 people get better acquainted with him they detect his clear intellect, upright judgment, and kind and broad mind. He is one of the men who formed the glorious phalanx of French statesmen of the early part of this century, and, like most of them, he belongs b}*- birth to the upper middle class of France, amongst which good sense, virtue, and honesty are carefully preserved as sacred traditions. As the trustee of the Memoirs of the Prince de Talleyrand, he has been left the discretionary power of acquainting the public, whenever he thinks fit, with that curious source of historic and, it may be feared, scandalous documents. M. Lambert Sainte-Croix is also a personage whose eminence cannot escape the notice of the Comte de Paris when selecting his advisers. He is a man of great talent, a powerful speaker, and seems to me especially gifted for the conduct of public affairs ; seeing how full of energy he is, he may not unlikely become the Casimir Perier* of Philippe VII. He is a gentleman of amiable and easy manners, and most communicative ; to his great political ability he adds all the qualities of a man of the world. We may remark here, that in France a public man needs not, as in England, frequent society in order to fill a high office. On the other side of the Channel, people are fond of forming cliques, which develops in some a morbid desire of exhibiting themselves, and in others that of seeing the former; as soon as a man has acquired any fame, he is bombarded with invitations from all sides, and becomes the prey of ladies, who anxiously dispute with each other the honour of gratifying the curiosity of their visitors to see the lion of the season. As a result of that fashion, her Majesty's Ministers must, I should think, at each Parliamentary recess, experience the sensation of overridden horses going to the stable. In * A famous French statesman, Minister of Louis-Philippe.

Besides the houses of their private friends, the chief members of the Orleanist party may be met at the Baronne Reille's Thursdays, at Madame Lambert Sainte-Croix's Mondays, and in the humble apartment occupied by M. Jules Simon in the Place de la Madeleine. The evenings of the charming Comtesse d'Haussonville also bring together, besides the leaders of fashion and society, a great number of the political friends of her husband. In that respect the salons of the Countess are usually frequented by nearly all the familiars of the Due de Broglie, of whom the Comte Othenin d'Haussonville is a nephew. Those evenings are pretty dull as a rule : the male element, con versing together often as mysteriously as would conspira tors, comes there neither for enjoyment nor to form new acquaintances. The reason of that is that in Paris society there are no political salons, those just mentioned being such only in name and appearance. An essential point is wanting : there is not in society a single lady trying to group round her the prominent supporters of the monarchical party, and whose influence is of any weight in directing the tide of public opinion. People seem now afraid of laying themselves open to criticism and ridicule by adopting that line of conduct, and the undefined character of the various salons I speak of, the limited and common-place part played by ladies at their receptions, seem to proceed from a dislike for the political salons of the past. Nowadays no one is anxious to submit to that etiquette, and everybody avoids carefully all that might lead to its revival. As you know, dear friend, I am fond of discovering the psychological explanations, giving the cause and fore casting the evolution of all the social facts I come across."], [91, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 75 My opinion is that the decadence and discredit brought to political salons in the eyes of Parisian society arise from the fact that power is in the hands of an adverse party, and that the causes of the change in politics since 1884 can in no wise flatter the vanity and pride of the upper classes. French people are extremely sensible, and like nothing so much as success. The lGth of May and its consequences were judged most impartially by all those who took a feverish interest in the issue of a plan so badly prepared and that failed so miserably. People in society have no objection to play the part of martyrs, of persecuted pilgrims of some grand and misunderstood idea, and of supporters of unacknowledged right ; but for no consideration would they consent to being regarded as gamblers who cheated and lost the game ! Frenchmen are witty ; they are so even collectively \u2014 a fact which has not been seen in any nation since the Athenians. Politics will no longer bore the upper classes ; the salons of yore will revive, and charming women will be found to adorn them and become their attraction, as soon as the monarchical party has redeemed its faults \u2014 not before. M. Bocher, the senator of the department of Calvados, and the most active and faithful of all the supporters of the Comte de Paris, is also the most competent man to lead his party in the right path. As I promised to be scrupulously sincere in my statements, I feel it my duty to point out an unjust opinion current in the public respect ing M. Bocher. People who give way too easily to the suggestions of party spirit call him freely ' the business man of the Princes of Orleans.' That qualification is treacherously false ; it has a certain semblance of truth, and yet is quite incorrect. M. Bocher never administered the fortune of the Princes. He was instructed to lay before the tribunal their legitimate protests against the arbitrary confiscation"], [92, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 76 of their property, and to claim its restitution. The case was a purely legal one, and M. Bocher succeeded in obtain ing a satisfactory decision of the court with regard to so just a cause. The decree aimed at the Princes interfered with the right of property, one of the essential bases of social order. It was only natural that that iniquitous measure should cease with the fall of the empire, whose supporters always regarded it as one of the mistakes of the Imperial Government. It is, however, a cause for regret that, on being replaced in possession of their property, the Princes did not give up the greater portion of the millions thus unexpectedly recovered to France, whose treasury was then exhausted. M. Bocher is much above the character of pettifogger and steward ascribed to him by the public. He is a shrewd politician, whose judgment is most enlightened and reliable, and of all the friends of the Comte de Paris, he is the only one whose suggestions are always followed. He is short, and has a pleasant face ; his smile is still youthful, and his conversation most attractive. He is fond of art and of beauty wherever they manifest themselves. Pretty women are pleasant to him as being the best productions ever formed by the hands of the Creator, the great Artist whose works are not all of such excellence. He delights in their company, which relieves him from the worry of his busy life. He watches passionately the interests of his Princes \u2014 that is the great object of his life ; old age cannot draw his attention from it ; failure and misfortune do not deter him from fulfilling what he considers a sacred duty. He will die in the breach, whilst defending their cause, and might use the language of Wolsey, but for the fact that the masters he serves may be unfortunate, but will never be ungrateful. Edouard Bocher, his son, seems to have inherited the qualities of his father, although he has not yet had the opportunity of displaying them. His intellect is sharp,"], [93, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 77 and very shrewd, and has developed special artistic apti tudes. His talent for drawing and water-colour painting is much appreciated by connoisseurs, and his technical knowledge very extensive. The situation so brilliantly filled by M. de Nieuwerkerke* during the Empire would suit marvellously the son of the senator of the department of Calvados ; no one else combines in the same degree the personal aptitude and the erudition requisite for dispensing judiciously the protection of Government to French art. M. Edouard Bocher married Mademoiselle Pajol, a pleasant lady, who enjoys a well-deserved reputation for good sense. It is a fact worth remark that men of a superior mind seldom fall in love with women remarkable for either wit or intellect ; amiable mediocrity pleases and suits them, and the partiality of Rousseau for Therese seems a human foible not unfrequently met with. But when a man of a really superior mind weds a woman of a pleasant and attractive intellect their union has a social importance of great value. The Due de Bisaccia is the most important of all the members of the former Legitimist party admitted to the intimacy of the Comte de Paris. He has embraced with great sincerity the cause of the grandson of Louis-Philippe. I should mention that the independence he displayed as leader of the Royalist Right in the Chamber had slightly diminished his credit at Frohsdorf. He is an honest man and a true nobleman, and the fact that some critics when judging him foolishly laid undue stress on the mundane surroundings in the midst of which he must needs live, on account of his high birth and situation, only tends to prove that there is a portion of the public that judges books by their covers, songs by their tunes, and men by their dresses. I shall again have to allude to the allegations of a certain production in two large volumes, which caused quite a stir last year, and in which a writer of great talent played the ~* Director of the national galleries of France."], [94, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 78 part of an erudite in the two first hundred pages, only to disappoint sadly his enlightened readers in the following four hundred pages of his work. In this the Due de Bisaccia was so roughly handled as to convince the public that the author only derived from unreliable sources the vaguest knowledge of the personage he intended to portray. The Due de Bisaccia is the son of the Due de Doudeau ville, Minister of Fine Arts under the Restoration, and bears an Italian title belonging to an estate bequeathed him by the Duchesse de Montmorency, his grandmother. He is thus possessed of a large fortune, of which he makes the noblest use. The home for convalescents in the Rue Sevres is wholly supported by him, and the poor of Escli mont and Bonnetable are well acquainted with the road leading to the chateau. He was very good-looking in his youth, when his handsome features betrayed his noble descent, and even now, almost a sexagenarian though he be, he is a living instance of the powers of virtue and happiness to preserve health and youth. He possesses neither great oratorical powers nor a matchless intellect, but his character is lofty, his judgment sound, and his mind is that of a shrewd and practical man. His chief quality consists in placing exquisite tact at the service of an upright con science. He has the tradition of the politeness and fine manners of the ancien -regime ; he is affable and kind, very reserved in his appreciations, yet most determined in all questions of principles. He has a certain foible for osten tation that is, however, palliated by the correct taste with which he does everything, as also by the unaffected ease he displays in living as he considers it is the duty of a nobleman to do. It is impossible to be more obliging and faithful ; he is a true friend both in prosperity and adver sity, hates slandering, and pacifies quarrels. He enjoys a very great influence over society, a privilege also shared by his wife, the Duchess."], [95, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 79 The Princesse Marie de Ligne, second wife of the Due de Bisaccia, is a very interesting lady. It seems as though Sylvestre Bonnard* intended to depict her in the portrait he draws of the Princess Trepof. This is how the old scholar expresses himself : ' Her face and figure were those of a grown-up woman. The fulness of her chest and the development of her waist could leave no doubt in that respect, even to an old scholar like myself. I will add, without any fear of making a mistake, that she was very handsome and had a very proud air ; indeed, my icono graphical researches have long enabled me to detect thc purity of a type and the characteristics of a face.' It affords me great pleasure, dear friend, to borrow the wonderful pen of M. A. Frances to describe one of the most prepossessing ladies it has been my good fortune to be acquainted with in the course of my numerous peregrina tions. Her moral portrait would require his delicate touch, his acute power of appreciation. The Duchesse de Bisaccia is such a fashionable lady that little of the woman is seen in her. Physical beauty is, however, a pretty safe criterion of moral worth, and I think I shall allow it to guide my judgment in the present case. The noble Duchess seems to me a lady of too high birth and feelings to be accessible to the temptations of the demon of vanity. She seems to regard the claims imposed on her by her rank and the sacrifice of a portion of her time to society as matters of conscience. At all events, she displays so much amiableness, and carries self-abnegation and concern for propriety so far, that I would fain believe that the burdens of her social life exceed its pleasures.

Their mother wraps them up in tender affection, always anxious lest anything should happen to them. Alas ! those children alone possess the power of giving her eyes an inexpressibly kind and meek expression. Superstition is the only foible of the Duchesse de Bisaccia ; it betrays her Polish descent on her mother's side. She collects a lot of trinkets, to which her fancy attributes all sorts of extraordinary powers. Her numerous friends rival each other in encouraging that innocent mania \u2014 whether because they are converted by her example or to promote their interests I cannot tell. Is not any pretext a legitimate one that will, even for a short time, attract her attention, and secure for those who resort to it the sweet spell infallibly arising from her charm and beauty ? The Due and Duchesse de Bisaccia receive many visitors. The most select representatives of aristocracy and of the noble faubourg, politicians, and the foreign and purely \"mundane elements, are to be met in the ducal salons. The Duke and his wife always checked the tendency of French society to allow political disagreements to bring about disunion in social relations ; they, however, succeeded in attacking prejudice without shocking any just suscep tibility. It needed uncommon discernment to resist and yield successfully to public opinion on that subject. The list of their invitations within the last fifteen years must have required more ability and study than a long poem, to undergo opportunely all the alterations it received. The personal good grace of the Duchesse de Bisaccia, the judicious way in which she selected her friends, and the sincerity of her friendship, contributed greatly to make her salon one of the most pleasant in Paris. She has always been held in very high estimation by all those who know her, which everybody cannot boast of doing."], [97, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 81 Some ten years ago certain families, as the Broglies, the D'Harcourts, the D'Haussonvilles, and the Segurs, were far from being held in high estimation in many salons of the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; their connection with the Princes of Orleans was too well known, and the hatred aroused in 1830 still alive. Even when the fusion was an accomplished fact, it was not without a feeling that may be likened to that which determined Mucius Sc\u00e6vola and Horatius Codes to make the sacrifice of their lives, that certain ladies-dowager resolutely made up their mind to acknowledge, by means of polite invitations, the reconcilia tion of the house of France. After the death of the Comte de Chambord, a complete change of scenery took place : the faithful supporters of the younger branch were congratu lated for the very reasons for which they were formerly so bitterly reproached, and the stone that closes the vault at Goritz* is so heavy that even the recollection of past discords seems now forgotten. The charm and virtue of the Prince's friends have increased so rapidly that regular infatuation has taken the place of former mis trust. The salon of the Dowager Marquise d'Harcourt has become one of those where admittance is most sought after. Few are called, and fewer still are those admitted to the honour of paying their respects to the old Marchioness. The latter is a lady of great culture, of charming good humour, and of high moral worth. She possesses the great art of conversation that consists in exciting wit in one's visitors, and there are few ladies who succeed so well in making strangers feel comfortable and at home. She has been a widow for the last two years ; her husband was modest, intelligent, and of kindly disposition. He repre sented with much dignity the Government of Marshal MacMahon at the Court of Queen Victoria. Two of his daughters are still unmarried.

Aline d'Harcourt, inherited the refined mind of her mother ; she often discharges the duties of maid-of-honour to the Comtesse de Paris The present Mar*quis d'Harcourt is one of those fortunate men with whom everything succeeds. He inherited all the fortune of Lord d'Harcourt\u2014 the last representative of a branch of his family settled in England \u2014 and married Mademoiselle de Biron, one of the prettiest girls in society. The features of the young Marchioness remind one of the handsome face of her father, the charming Comte de Biron, who was so elegant and uncommonly correct in his manners. She has given her husband five lovely children. The Marquis d'Harcourt is the intimate friend \u2014 almost the brother \u2014 of the Due de Chartres. The Comte de Paris has much esteem and affection for him. If monarchical loyalty could be reckoned in miles, he has so much travelled lately in the company of the future majesties that he might be considered one of the most faithful servants of royalty. The traditions of his family and his knowledge of several European languages would probably make of him one of the ambassadors of the government of Philippe VII. He is a man of shrewd and practical mind, of uncommonly clear judgment and upright conscience. The Vicomte Emmanuel d'Harcourt, his brother, seems to have inherited at his birth all the evil chances which were fortunately spared to the lucky head of the family. His mind and manners are very refined ; he is remarkably good-looking, possesses tact and great culture ; in short, all the qualities of an accomplished gentleman, and was regarded in his family as destined to fill the highest situations. When the marshal-president selected his young relative as chief secretary, everybody thought that the flattering stir roused by the name of that almost unknown young man was the beginning of his dawning fame, and the highest hopes were built on a career so happily begun. Four years later that infatuation had entirely vanished."], [99, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 83 My opinion is that, being absorbed by the pursuit of pleasures and satisfactions, which very seldom lead to the direct path of glory, the Vicomte d'Harcourt did not display the assiduousness and attention required in the discharge of his important duties. He played, in reality, a political part far less active than that attributed to him by the public. There is, however, no doubt that he advised the Marshal to make the dangerous experiment of May 16. How was it that he overlooked the unfortunate equivocation which com pelled men, whose sole moral strength consisted in the respect they had always professed for the law, to forsake their prin ciples and compromise themselves' by having recourse to the very means, to brand and denounce which they had devoted their lives ? Doctrinaires by birth and tradition were asked to become men of action. The struggle was lost beforehand ; besides, its pretext was so unjust that thorough success alone could have justified the undertaking. Strange to say, the Marshal was almost exonerated from any blame. His advisers, and especially the Vicomte d'Harcourt, were made to bear by some the odium of the attempted coup d'etat, and by others the shame of the defeat. The young secretary had doubtless incurred a share of responsibility in all this, but that ascribed to him is out of all proportion to what he really did. Unlucky as was the inspiration that launched the Vicomte d'Harcourt into politics, it was nothing to that which tempted him to follow the modern fashion which induces the descendants of old families to join the ranks of the motley crowd that gambles on the Exchange. The great seduction of the blue, pink, and yellow* strips of paper consists in the fact that their management requires little apprenticeship or ability, and displays to the eyes of contemporary youths the tempting mirage of the satisfac tion of their coveted dreams.

Ill-luck followed him so persistently that everybody must have thought either that the proverb is treacherously false, or that the roads leading to Paphos and to Cythera must have grown roses under his tread. The Comte de Paris will, therefore, have to find out with out delay a fetich for M. d'Harcourt. When the Prince shall have discovered one possessed of due efficacy, we may wonder what he will do with the ex-secretary, rescued at last from his ill-luck ! A showy office would just suit him. The post of grand master of ceremonies, or of introducer of ambassadors, would, I think, just meet his wishes, seeing that the golden leisure of that situation would enable him to add many chapters to past romance. He could then allow the fair sex to give him the compensation he is entitled to from it for the damage done to his career. His two younger brothers, the Comtes Amedee and Louis d'Harcourt, are in the army. The former married Mademoiselle de la Guiche, the grand-daughter of the Due de Mortemart ; the latter is the fortunate husband of Mademoiselle Lanjuinais, the daughter of the much esteemed representative of Brittany in the Chamber. The Comte Othenin d'Haussonville, whose father was one of the ' forty,' and who himself will in all probability be some day elected to the Academy, married Mademoiselle d'Harcourt, the eldest sister of the Marquis of that name. She looks hardly more than thirty years of ago, which she was at the time of her marriage, twenty years ago, and could easily pass in society for an elder sister of her own eldest daughter. She may be ranked amongst the most intellectual women of French society. Her mind is full of imagination, clear and substantial; her judgments dis play a certain loftiness of views, an amount of wisdom and practical good sense, that fall seldom to the lot of her sex.

Like our mother Eve, she would have plucked the apple, and, for her, Adam would not have hesitated to sin. She has culture, and much taste for contemporary literature ; in this she is not so exclusive as her husband. The latter is the rival of M. Maxime du Camp in the field of social investigations \u2014 perhaps not a very entertaining subject, although the Count excels in its treatment. M. Othenin d'Haussonville is a diligent contributor to the Revue des Deux Mondes, and is the candidate of that periodical to a seat in the Acade'mie Francaise, and two years at most will elapse before the doors of the Institut are thrown open to him. He is bony, of fair complexion and cold appear- ance ; very seldom discloses his inward thought, and has never allowed anyone to discover his secrets. The prettiest eyes in the world failed to exercise the desired influence on this grandson of Madame de Stael. He frequents society with a view to relax his over-worked mind in the midst of frivolities, and seems to hear with artistic pleasure the current nonsenses of society prattle. He has four daughters, the eldest of whom possesses angelic features and a delightfully fair complexion ; his second daughter is quite as good-looking as her sister, and is a portrait of the mother; as for the other two girls, there is every prospect of their rivalling their sisters in wit and beauty. Will they not suffice to console 'un grand cheval de Lorraine '* for leaving no heir to his name ? So as not to excite the jealousy of M. d'Haussonville, I shall appoint him to represent his Majesty abroad. St. Petersburg being rather far, I shall give him the choice between Madrid and Constantinople. It will not cost me any more to entrust M.

Full of academical correctness as is the Comte Othenin d'Haussonville, M. Piou possesses Parlia mentary stiffness in no less a degree. The latter is a talented speaker, as could be seen from his maiden speech. His oratorical powers enable him to wend his way easily through the most intricate legal points. His speeches are noteworthy for powerful logic, the natural sequence of his deductions and his masterly style. His mind is lofty, practical, and moderate at the same time, and, as such, is especially sympathetic to the Comte de Paris. Some important career will no doubt be opened to his activity the day when Philippe VII. possesses the right of select ing the servants of the country. The Marquis de la Ferronnays and M. Trubert are amongst the deputies of the Right whose opinion may be regarded as the authorized expression of that of the Comte de Paris. The Marquis is the son of the faithful friend of the Comte de Chambord. It is sufficient praise to say that he is in every respect worthy of his father. He resembles the latter very much physically and morally, with the only difference that his appreciations are uttered in a more sarcastic and critical spirit. His mother, the Comtesse de la Ferronnays, nee Gibert, perhaps imparted to him the power of originality which gives so much attraction to her conversation. Her charity excites uni versal admiration, and has become a positive mania with her; her erudition is varied, and such as one seldom meets in a woman ; her tastes are for art and study, yet, as a curious contrast, she is fond of devoting a portion of her time to the trifles of social life. The management of her parties and the care of her household haunt her sleep ; and she will suddenly break a learned conversation to express to her visitors the grief \u2014 to them truly comical \u2014 caused her by the omission of some insignificant detail in the organization"], [103, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII.

She reads Epictetus in the original text, but the slave-philosopher has not taught her to bear patiently such trifles as a failure in the cooking of a dish, the delay of a guest, or the dulness of a party. People ought, how ever, to feel indebted to her for the trouble she takes to entertain the class by which she has been so heartily welcomed and accepted, that she seems to have been by birth a La Ferronnays as indisputably as she is now entitled to bear that name. Her daughter-in-law, nee Des Cars, is the most perfect type of grace and high-born manners. She seems to belong to a variety largely repre sented in Paris society, and whose chief characteristics are politeness, refined education, and the absence of originality, replaced, however, by an anxious concern for propriety that dictates every word and prompts every action.

The impulse given in the same direction by twenty generations of beings, who have thought and acted in accordance with the same principles and ideas, seems to be flowing in the very veins of their descendants, and to have so thoroughly modified their physical and moral nature as to substitute itself for their individuality. The assimilation is so complete as to leave people almost un conscious of its taking place. They act in accordance with aristocratic precepts readily, and without premedita tion ; freewill is almost annihilated in them.

I mean the Marquis de Beauvoir and his wife. They both occupy a very brilliant situation in society, and, in the event of a restoration, will play an important part in the future Court of Philippe VII. The Marquis de Beauvoir is a very intelligent gentleman, of pleasant features and exquisite manners. He has the honour of acting as the spokesman of the Comte de Paris whenever it is thought advisable to give a rallying-word or express a wish \u2014 that is, in reality, to convey the orders of the pretender. He performs with the utmost shrewdness, tact, and judgment the missions entrusted to him. M. de Beauvoir is, therefore, justly considered as the most invalu able of private secretaries. He is himself quite aware of the fact ; he knows the inward thought of his royal master ; * ' The Thorough Falconer.' J ' The Perfect Maid-of-honour.

The reason for this is that we live in the age of steam, and M. de Beauvoir is thoroughly imbued with its spirit. All his tastes are modern \u2014 in fact, everything in him is modern. He is fond of literary, social, and political modernism, in quest of which he even went to Pekin. At twenty years of age nothing in him could have led to suppose that he would some day be so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the age. Madame de Rumigny, his mother, is a lady of much sense and great virtue ; she carefully brought him up and reared him in the rigid principles which ruled home-life in Orleanist circles. His destiny seemed traced beforehand. To pass brilliant examinations, to perform a pleasant voyage and write an account of it, to marry his cousin, to contribute to serious periodicals, to display the qualities of a good courtier and loyal National Guard, and to enjoy the mundane pleasures of life, such was indeed the fate which seemed to await this young pupil of the doctrinaire school. But when Thetis immersed the infant Achilles in the Styx she omitted to dip his heel in the water, thus the hero remained vulnerable in that part. An unexpected tutor, taking advantage of the weak point in the Marquis de Beauvoir's nature, added his teachings to those of the learned mother of that gentleman and of the strict masters who had brought him up. He was thus taught to read the enigma of life in very sweet eyes ; but the solution of that enigma was not exactly what he had learned in his youth. Certain people are of opinion that preconceived ideas will paralyze thought. By skilful and gradual training the thinking powers of the Marquis acquired unusual elasticity, which, amongst other advantages, seems to have determined him to shake off the hackneyed prejudice according to which all men must"], [106, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 90 work. Forgetting his early successes, the author of ' Java, Siam et Canton ' seems now to regard the literary profession as beneath him. But, then, what is the use of writing when one has reached the desired goal ? What is the use of hunting after the suitable adjective or of trying to master the refractory syntax when one reads daily the most lovely poem that ever was written \u2014 that of love given and returned? The brisk and clever pen that described China and Australia is now buried in deep slumber, and its happy proprietor has turned his activity to the field of the political future. Love and ambition pull well together ; a car drawn by such a team was seldom left in the mire. Clodion and Houdon must have perceived the features of the Marquise de Beauvoir in a dream. Her unclassical beauty is full of grace ; her face, sparkling with wit, reminds the salons of Paris of the playful and winning charm of the gallant eighteenth century. She excites universal admiration. That feeling is, how ever, not imposed on her as the tribute paid to certain cold beauties, of whom people speak but do not dream, but rather won by the attraction she exercises, and wliich is so delicate and complete, and, at the same time, full of harm less gaiety, that all her admirers consider themselves men of sense and judgment \u2014 at least, as long as they are under the spell. There is charm even in the stiff way in which she carries her head ; the graceful attitudes she skilfully assumes are full of lovely affectation. She is not naturally handsome, and her beauty is neither wonderful nor dazzling ; it is much more and better than that \u2014 the result of an ardent desire to please handed down from generation to generation during three centuries, some marvellous gift of flirtation, owing to which a young and lively creature is happy to exist.

When Venus untied her girdle, Minerva threw away her lance out of spite, and put her golden helmet on her head in order to set off her charms ; but all without avail. The deuce take argumentation ; true wisdom resides in happiness. Such is your doctrine, Marquise ; and the right one it is, too. Many pupils came to you for tuition, and though you may have sent them away with dunce-caps, they never dreamed of cursing the school or quarrelling with the professor. The Marquise de Beauvoir is the lady who dresses best and most originally of all Paris society. Her costumes fit so nicely as to seem to be part of her person, and quite reflect the grace and charm of her lovely figure ; her dress might furnish the elements of a regular novel, her hat inspire a lovely poem. I congratulate her on her good taste in rejecting jewels ; there are none so fine, that I know, to ever equal the charms they might cover. Many men have undoubtedly thought what I now write ; many remember severe treatment, which they would fain exchange for many favours. But there are defeats well worth victories. The Marquise de Beauvoir, the Marquise d'Harcourt, the Comtesse d'Haussonville, and the Vicomtesse de Butler, have the honour of waiting on the Comtesse de Paris. Madame de Butler, daughter of the Comte de Sercey, former Ambassador, is, by her mother, the cousin of the Marquis de Beauvoir. When the Comtesse de Paris re sided in Paris, the Vicomtesse was her lady-in-waiting, and discharged her duties with much tact and cheerful ness. The Princes of Orleans are extremely fond of home life, which accounts for the fact of their confining their sympathies to the same circles. The affection felt towards the member of a family induces kindly dispositions towards all the other members. When the question of making"], [108, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 92 appointments to the royal household is debated, it is highly probable that the various offices will be distributed amongst the families I have just mentioned. The Duchesse de Luynes, a child of the first marriage of the Due de Bisaccia, will also occupy a post \u2014 one of the most important \u2014 in the future royal household. Her mother, daughter of the Due de Polignac, was she whose dazzling beauty and youthful happiness caused her pre- mature death to be universally mourned by society ; and the affection she had inspired during her too short exist- ence was secured by her daughter, who at eighteen married the Due de Luynes, her cousin. Three years later the war of 1870 broke out. In the face of the disasters of France, the Due solicited and obtained a commission in the Sarthe regiment of Mobile Guards. The young Duchesse, who already possessed a son, had recently given birth to a little girl, but stern death was once more to disturb her prospects of happiness. The Due de Luynes gallantly fell on the battle-field of Loigny. A widow at twenty-one, the Duchesse nearly sank under the blow ; but the duty of a mother to her children is not merely to give them birth ; and she courageously bore her immense grief, and wholly devoted herself to the education of her children, dear tokens of her lost happiness. She now lives in retirement, surrounded by treasures of art and cheered by the love of her family and the affection of her numerous friends. She is a lady of unusually energetic nature, intelligent and sympathetic, and possesses the rare and delicate gift of finding tolerable happiness in elements which to other people only afford passing distraction. She is not pretty, but the expression of her blue eyes, full of disconso late sadness, is in affecting contrast with the smile of her childish lips. All her nature is summed up in that con trast, whence proceeds the rare power she has of being understood both by happy and distressed people."], [109, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 93 The Comtesse de Paris is very fond of the Duchesse de Luynes, and displays similar affection for the Duchesse de Fezensac. The head of the house of Montesquieu and the hand some lady who became his wife, nearly eighteen years ago, are a very pleasant couple ; their undisturbed happiness has been so thorough that years have gone by without leaving any mark on them. The Due is of middle height ; but, as if to make up for his short stature, he has the largest cards and the longest stick, smokes the largest cigars, and possesses the most sonorous voice in all Paris. He is a little man with very large views \u2014 a big bell in a small tower. He has ridiculous prejudices and great quali ties ; is bluff\" and teasing in manners, and yet full of tact, intelligence, and learning. He is beloved by his wife, and lives with her in his hotel in the Rue de la Baume. His house is a regular museum of art, in the eighteenth-century style. The Duchesse de Montesquieu - Fezensac is the daughter of the Baron d'lvry, well known for his collecting mania, who enjoyed in society the reputation of a connoisseur in articles of vertu, and died two years ago, leaving his dear treasures behind him. From her father the Duchesse de Fezensac learned the supreme art of furnishing her house, and her lovely person derives the benefit of her learned care by being a perfect wonder of discreet elegance. Like the violet, everything in her is unassuming \u2014 her grace, her kindness, and her intellect. She dresses simply, and hates gaudy colours ; she never raises her voice, and never says anything but gracefully and quite to the purpose. She is a matchless hostess, wonderfully versed in the difficult art of entertaining her guests ; and the private parties, where people are invited to converse in the midst of the masterpieces of Fragonard and Boucher, and the gems of Gouthiere and Riesener, afford delightful pleasure to the eyes and to the mind."], [110, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 94 Seeing that I promised to acquaint the Comte de Paris with the intentions of his future Majesty, I shall tell him that he cannot do otherwise than to draw up as follows the list of the ladies who will have the honour of waiting on the Comtesse de Paris : The Duchesse de Luynes, the Duchesse de Fezensac, the Marquise de Beauvoir, the Vicomtesse de Butler, the Princesse Victor de Broglie, Mademoiselle d'Harcourt, the Vicomtesse de Greffulhe. As my pen traces the-last-mentioned name, it strikes me, my young friend, that I have not yet acquainted you with the hotel of the Rue d'Astorg, which, like the house of the Marquis d'Harcourt, is a hotbed of Orleanist spirit. The title of Greffulhe is of recent creation, and is more suggestive of lucky speculations on the Exchange than of fights and war adventures. But the old blood of Vintimille, of La Rochefoucauld, and of Caraman, has been so success fully crossed with the plebeian element that no trace is left of the latter except in family-papers. The Comtesse de Greffulhe is the daughter of the Due d'Estissac. She is an upright lady, of shrewd mind and meek manners. Her intellect is practical, full of initiative, and quite able to assume the management of her affairs. She enjoys great influence in her family and amongst her friends ; her evenings are pleasant, although devoid of the charm which a lively animation imparts to social gather ings. This drawback is, perhaps, due to the fact that no member of the house is thoroughly sociable. Visitors feel that their presence there is rather endured and tolerated than desired and welcomed. When the masters of the house open their salons and light their tapers, they seem rather to perform a duty than to enjoy themselves. But people seldom give more pleasure than they receive, and cheerful dispositions are not always communicative. The Comte de Greffulhe is a kind, timid, and nervous gentleman. He seems ever labouring under some pre occupation, which may possibly proceed from the trouble"], [111, "WHAT THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII. MAY BE LIKE. 95 caused him by the millions he possesses, which people say are represented by three figures. The poor and the sick relieve him, however, of a portion of his vast income. This good man, unlike Dives, the rich man of the Scriptures, is the generous founder of various charitable institutions, endowed and supported by him with princely liberality, where the unfortunate of the world can obtain not merely the crumbs off his table, but whole dishes. Loyalty to the younger branch is a tradition in the house of Greffulhe, and the fact that the Comte de Gref fulhe married one of his daughters to the Prince d'Aren berg, and the other to the Comte de l'Aigle, both of whom have embraced the political faith of their father-in-law, further increases the ties that bind his family to the cause of the Princes of Orleans. With respect to the political conversions above-mentioned, I may add that a great many people have now, as you know, rallied the flag of the pretender, so that the road of Damas may be said to have been very much frequented lately. The Princesse d'Arenberg is frail, delicate, and almost impalpable. She is graceful and witty, paints flowers like Madame Lemaire,* is as conversant with literature as M. Sarcey,t and expresses herself with infinite charm and ability. She is not fond of society, and lives rather retired. She greets her friends with a lovely smile, beaming with unselfish kindness, and is fortunately too much aware of the pleasure people experience in her society to deprive her fellow- creatures of it. Her husband has a. pleasant countenance, and a very sensible mind, but a certain melancholy seems to hang over his thoughts. People say that he was formerly of gay and cheerful dis position, but since the tragical death of his twin-brother, murdered in St. Petersburg, he ha's never been seen to smile. Regret is not contagious, and that felt by the Prince * Madeleine Lemaire, a talented contemporary French lady artist. f Francisque Sarcey, the well-known French literary critic."], [112, "96 SOCIETY IN PARIS. d'Arenberg has not modified the dispositions of his brother in-law, the Vicomte de Greffulhe. The latter is jovial, of a high-coloured complexion, and a truly jolly companion. He must be of opinion that men are miserable only by their own fault, and that one need only possess a princely income, dispose of truly royal hunting-grounds, be married to the most lovely woman in Paris, dine well and digest better still, in order to snap one's fingers at the pessimists, and gaily await the age of decrepitude. The Vicomte de Greffulhe has the honour of entertaining the Princes on his Bois-Boudran estate every year, and inviting them to bag the largest quantity of game that any gentleman can boast of in France. The Vicomtesse receives her royal guests with charming and supreme grace. She is a very handsome lady, of ideal and dreamy beauty. Her large black eyes are sweet and deep ; her fine and proud profile has the grace of some antique cameo, and the poet described her noble bearing in the following line : ' Incessu vera patuit dea.' She possesses all the winning grace of youth, unaware of its charms \u2014 she is not yet twenty-five \u2014 with the hesitation and indecision peculiar to people who feel their way and have not yet realised their own powers. She is passionately fond of music, and takes pleasure in organizing private parties where fashionable music lovers find the gratification of their taste with the most charming hospitality. In order to conclude this rapid sketch of the future Court of Philippe VIL, I must speak to you of the Marquis de Breteuil and of M. Arthur O'Connor, who will, of course, resume near the Prince the intimate position they held before his exile. The former is the grandson of M. Fould* and inherited * The wealthy Minister of Napoleon III."], [113, "WHA T THE COURT OF PHILIPPE VII.

The heir of the name, famous in the annals of the old monarchy, is an original full of charm and gaiety. He has modern cheer, is a man of acute sense and winning kindness, and is held in universal esteem. He was married to Mademoiselle de Castelbajac, whom premature death withdrew from the affection of her relations, and whose rare beauty, charm and intellect have left profound regret in all those who knew her. M. A. O'Connor is the very counterpart of the Marquis de Breteuil. His tastes are similar, his speeches bear the same stamp, and seldom have two friends been better matched ; this is the exception that confirms the rule of sympathy between contrasts. M. O'Connor is the husband of a very amiable lady, brought up at the Hotel de Ganay, a regular museum of contemporary trinkets and articles of virtu. The Comte de Ganay, her father, is to be seen at all the leading sales of the Saile Drouot* He is thoroughly conversant with the art of the eighteenth century, and one of the most competent judges in matters of taste. Amongst the young men admitted in the present intimate circle of the Comte de Paris, we may point out two warm supporters of the Royalist cause, the Baron de Fonscolombe and the Vicomte de Saporta, who both enjoy a very high personal influence in Provence, and represent with the Prince his faithful Southern nobility. They are not the Roumestansf of the aristocracy ; such a character could only be a barrister or a deputy \u2014 that is, a middle-class man. These noblemen say what they mean, although they really * The well-known auction-rooms in Paris. f ' Numa Roumestan,' one of the best productions of M.

M. de Saporta is a refined scholar, who has contributed to various periodicals articles full of talent and ability. M.M. de Chevilly, Aubry, Vitet, and Dufeuille, the Prince's secretaries, have a great future before them.

FOURTH LETTER. THE DUCAL FAMILIES. Paris society, as a rule, is utterly ignorant of all nobiliary matters. With the exception of three or four aristocratic scholars as thoroughly acquainted with the history of, and the part played by, the French nobility, as Cherin and D'Hozier, and who are consulted on all obscure points, nobody knows much about it, but everybody talks of it at random. People complacently set forth the most unjusti fiable pretensions which now no one is empowered to check, and were the Due de Saint-Simon to visit the France of to-day, he would be horrified and abashed with indig nation. Before the Revolution, noblemen whose titles were posterior to the year 1400 were not admitted to the King's * 'The King,' in Provencal."], [115, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 99 carriages ; but the severity of that regulation was not always strictly enforced, seeing that the officers of the King were not wholly inaccessible to financial bargains. The nobility was composed of titled persons, such as the foreign Princes, the Dukes holding a peerage, the hereditary Dukes, and the brevet Dukes,* and of people of noble descent bearing none of those titles. The peerage was formerly attached to certain ecclesiastic or lay fiefs, and its title belonged to the possessors of the land or benefice. The peers attended the ceremony of the King's corona tion in the Cathedral of Rheims ; dressed in their gorgeous robes, they waited on the future Sovereign, carried the royal insignia and jewels, placed the crown on the head of the new King, and were the first to take the oath. The temporal peers were the Due de Bourgogne, the Due de Normandie, the Due de Guyenne, the Comtes de Tou louse, De Flandre and De Champagne. From the time of Philippe the Fair the French Kings assumed the right of creating new ducliis-pairies.\\ At that time the most im portant fiefs of the Crown had either become Crown pro perty or been parcelled out, and the Princes of the blood represented the symbolic peers of old France at the corona tion. Early in the sixteenth century the dignity of Duke and peer was conferred on the grandson of Dunois with the title of Longueville, and on a Prince of the house of Savoy with the title of Nemours. A mere gentleman was also raised to the peerage, Claude Gouffier, the head of the Choiseul family, who was appointed Due de Rouannais in 1519, and died on the very day of his appointment. This might have proved a capital innovation, had the new titles conferred definite rights instead of mere Court dignities on their owners, and had the latter preserved amongst them the traditions of a national policy, as did * Whose title died with them. \u2022f* Peerages with the titles of Dukes. 7\u20142"], [116, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 100 English peers. A powerful aristocracy, winning the sym pathy of the people, linked to the history of the nation, and well known to be willing to make any sacrifice to the interests of the country, might, at an early period, have constituted itself above the nobility and counterbalanced royal power. Francis I., who was the first to raise gentlemen to the peerage and to make Dukes of them, was doubtless un acquainted with the difference that exists between the aristocracy and the nobility. His object was simply to diminish the position of the Princes of the blood by placing on a par with them at first royal bastards like Longueville, foreign Princes like Nemours and Guise and afterwards mere gentlemen like Gouffier. The royal favour also fell on Jean de Brosses, the grandson of Commines, but Francis I. only raised the ComU of Etampes to a dukedom and peerage in favour of De Brosses, on the condition that the latter should marry Anne d'Heilly. The future Duchesse, a tall and fair daughter of Picardy, with blue eyes and golden hair, was maid-of-honour to Louise de Savoie ; her charms had fascinated the King after his return from Madrid, and quite furthered the views of the Queen-mother, incensed at the presumption of the Comtesse de Chateau briand. The dnchi-pairie, having been conferred under such gallant auspices to a member of the nobility, was seldom given by the Valois, whereas the Bourbons made a more liberal use of that favour. Henri IV. was, however, very sparing of it. But for the strange batch of the Quatorze* of which Saint- Simon speaks with so much bitterness, Louis XIII. would not have deserved the blame of the noble Duke ; as for Louis XIV., it must be con fessed that he so lavished that title as to depreciate its value. However, the number of Dukes with a peerage did not increase in great proportions, for owing to the fact that the patent letters were only granted to the male heirs in * The fourteen dukes created by Louis XIII."], [117, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 101 the direct line, many peerages were escheated. The col lateral branch of an extinct ducal family could not succeed to the peerage and title unless authorized to do so by royal letters patent, as in the case of new creations. At the death of Louis XV., thirty-nine Dukes sat in Parliament as peers of France ; there existed besides twelve titles of hereditary Dukes without a peerage. The titles of twenty three of those Dukes and peers are still borne in France. They are the following: Uzes, La Tre'moille, Luynes, Brissac, Richelieu, Rohan, Gramont, Mortemart, Noailles, Aumont, Harcourt, Fitz-James, Chaulnes, Valentinois, Praslin, La Rochefoucauld, Lorge, Broglie, Aubigny, Estissac, La Force, Maille, Clermont-Tonnerre. The Dues d'Uzes call themselves first Dukes of France ; that is a groundless pretension, only based on an equivoca tion. Twelve peerages with the title of Duke were created before that of Uzes, and the first Duke of that name only ranked thirteenth in Parliament. But when Louis XIII. decreed that the patents of the Dukes, peers of the king dom, should be examined by the chambre des enquetes,* he also decided that thereafter they should sit in the order in which the examination took place. The Due d'Uzes hastened to comply with the royal edict. His carriage having met that of the Due de Luynes in the Rue Saint Thomas-du-Louvre,t he shouted to his coachman to drive on so as to enable him to reach the court of inquiry before his rival. The two heavy vehicles came into collision in the narrow street : there was no alternative but to let one drive on or to upset it. Uzes unceremoniously landed Luynes in the mud ; his coachman whipped his horses and triumphantly arrived first. The name of the jehu to whom the house of Uzes is entitled for a portion of its honours has not been handed down by history. The title of Due d'Uzes is now borne by a youth of seventeen, but, in accordance with the rule now obtaining in France, he * A board of inquiry. t A narrow street no longer existing."], [118, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 102 will assume his title only after he has finished his studies, on entering society. He is far more concerned with pre paring himself to pass brilliant examinations, and to learn in order to become ' somebody ' through his own merits, as he himself says, with great simplicity, than with making a proud show of his rank. He is full of sense, plain and straightforward in his dealings, and there is every prospect that he will prove a worthy descendant of his race ; besides, he has a very pleasant appearance, and is a ' beau duquet,'* as people say in Provence, where his family estate is situated \u2014 for he is one of the few French Dukes who still possess their duchies. The old castle of Uzes is a rather dark and dismal building, erected in the very centre of the town that bears its name, whieh itself stands in the midst of a mountainous, volcanic and barren country of wild and picturesque aspect. The surrounding district contains many villages whose half- ruined towers formerly belonged to the Duchy of Uzes. The sight of the remnants of what was once a redoubtable power reminds us of the times when Reiters rode along the plains and fought against the nobles in the dark fields where Uzes challenged Toulouse and held the valley of the Rhone. As a com pensation for those bygone days, the Due d'Uzes possesses wealth, which now gives power, as good arquebuses, strong walls and large ditches secured it in the days of his ancestors. The house of Charost having left no direct heir, its fortune, increased by the enormous wealth of the Bethunes, has gone over to the house of Uzes, whose representative has also inherited the millions of his mother, earned in the lucrative business of the Champagne wines of the well-known firm of the widow Cliquot. The Duchesse d'Uzes is a very kind and charitable lady, full of simplicity. She is a Mortemart by birth and the grand-daughter of the Comte de Chevigne, the witty author of the ' Contes Remois ;' but, notwithstanding such ancestry, * A fine 'little Duke.'"], [119, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 103 the spirit of Madame de Montespan was not present at the birth of the future Duchesse, who has not inherited the spirit of the Mortemarts ; and if Louis XIV. were to come to life again, he would notice a great difference between Athenai's* and her posterity. Being left a widow at thirty, the Duchess discharged her maternal duties with rare energy. She is wonderfully active, and devotes her time to charitable deeds, sporting and agricultural pursuits, and to the social claims of her position, without ever seeming to hurry over whatever work she is engaged in. People generally waste their time in thinking of their own joys or troubles ; but the Duchesse d'Uzes never thinks of herself, and quietly pursues her daily task \u2014 that of making people happy around her. She secures the blessings of the poor and the sympathies of society. Her sweet and kind influence opens to her children the flowery path of life. She is unassuming in her manners, quite free from coquetry, and dresses with great simplicity ; her open, cordial, and somewhat masculine ways are those of women inaccessible to the vanity of their sex. She wears her superb diamonds always on a black and invariably high dress, and I am sure that she takes far less interest in the way she dresses than does her maid ; but she is full of taste with respect to home arrangements, and her work \u2014 the hotel in the Champs-Elysees \u2014 embellished and restored under her own supervision, is a wonder of practical comfort and artistic elegance. There may be noticed, amongst other pictures, her portrait by Gerome and that of the late Duke, her husband \u2014 a striking likeness, and one of the best productions of Coignet, the painter. The Due de la Tremoille is, since the death of the last representative of the house of Montmorency, the first nobleman in France. This assertion might, however, be disputed. Other families \u2014 that of the Rohans, for instance \u2014 might put forth pretensions to take the lead of the * The Christian name of Madame de Montespan."], [120, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 104 French nobility, and back those pretensions with very serious arguments. There is, however, little doubt that an impartial judge would give his decision in favour of the house of La Tremoille. The military fame of that family, the importance of its marriages, and its uninterrupted filiation, give it the first rank in France. The present Duke married Mademoiselle Marguerite-Egle Duchatel, the daughter of an ex-Minister of Louis-Philippe ; two children were born from that marriage : a son, the Prince de Tarente, and a daughter, who became the wife of the Comte de la Rochefoucauld, the eldest son of the Due de Bisaccia. The Due de la Tremoille is a fit descendant of the stout and dauntless knights of old, and the commonplace frock coat of the nineteenth century does not in his case, as in that of many of his contemporaries, surround with grotesque improbability the recollection of the armour of his ancestors. AVe may easily imagine that powerful fellow dealing heavy blows with the sword of those days, and Francis I. would certainly not disown the grandson of his friend. He seems to regret the good old time, and, although he affects modern fashion in his manners, the dedication with which he headed the edition of the ' Chartrier de Thouars ' (a collection of his family papers) might have been signed by his ancestor. His great wealth and high situation enabled him to carry out any ambition he might have had ; but he had none. He has not exhausted the pleasures of life, and to reward the dis cretion with which he enjoyed it years passed by without almost leaving any trace on him. Though fifty years of age, he is as young-looking as many men of thirty, and is renowned amongst his friends for his cheerful gaiety. He always watched life as a disinterested spectator of human comedy, not because it disappointed him and deceived his expectations, but simply because he never felt inclined to enter the stage and compete with his contemporaries. I"], [121, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 105 am inclined to see in this nobleman, who, from his birth, has never had any illusions, a sensitive and refined being, one of those analysts of sensations and feelings who fear instinc tively to expose their individuality to the gaze of the crowd, to confront the shocks and the blows of public life, and who, out of a mixed feeling of shyness and indifference, live according to the whim of circumstances. This is no isolated case in the French aristocracy ; it often happens that the spring of initiative and energy gets relaxed amongst the descendants of old heroic families. That peculiarity varies according to people's nature and to the society they live in ; but notwithstanding the diversity of its manifestations, they all bear witness to the existence of the same evil \u2014 a certain want of moral strength. With some that constitutional disease takes the shape of an inordinate craving for pleasures, far exceeding the ordinary limits of the passions of youth ; they fall a prey to the temptations which the gay city offers to wealthy idlers whose principles are rather loose. When they have once begun that reckless life they cannot shake it off. Eventually they have no other aim but to enjoy the ex citement of the gambling-table and to indulge in vulgar and easy love-intrigues ; they lose gradually the sentiment of every social and moral duty, and, broken down by age and excesses, they furnish a sight painful and grotesque at the same time. With others that want of energy is only felt in the sphere of action, and deprives them of all initiative. A some what morbid susceptibility, the fear \u2014 arising from their inexperience of men and things \u2014 of exposing in some unpleasant adventure the great name handed down to them, prevents them from undertaking anything. They have some vague idea of the part they are called to play here below, and yet fret inwardly at their own uselessness, but natural indolence, added to the vain scruples of their caste, which overrules all other feelings, helps to paralyze what"], [122, "106 SOCIETY IN PARIS. little energy they still possess, and they doom themselves to be for ever socially useless. That weakness very often causes a certain mental derangement, which brings about in their conduct a positive inconsistency, inexplicable to superficial observers. Those people seem incapable of any connected reasoning, and yet they will perform isolated deeds of courage, honesty, or abnegation. There is great incongruity in their actions. They will sometimes prove of weak and inconsistent character, and act according to their whims ; at other times they will act like strong-minded and determined men. Their inconsistency proceeds from moral and physical causes. Over-refinement so develops their nervous system that they deeply feel the least shock or annoyance. They have taken the habit of giving way to their sensations, to have recourse to expedients and delays in order to avoid struggling manfully with the necessities of life. Thus they readily compound with their conscience, and allow them selves to be driven into the most painful situations. Unarmed though such people are for the battle of life, they still possess some of the hereditary pride and heroism of their race ; transient and violent excitement will cause all that still remains in them of the blood of their warlike ancestors\u2014 feudal lords, illustrious bandits, and noble high waymen \u2014 to rush to their heads, and so intoxicate them as to render them capable of isolated instances of the proud and daring deeds of the past. All future hope in them must not, therefore, be altogether given up. The main body of the troops maybe easily defeated, but the reserves may be relied on. It must, however, be confessed that they are not very comforting in the practice of everyday life. You must not ask them to do anything likely to cause them lasting inconvenience ; such as, for instance, to modify their way of living, to bind themselves to serious occupations, or to give up fashionable habits,"], [123, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 107 which they follow with a strict regularity which, in their eyes, gives them the appearance of social duties. When such men have squandered their fortune and exhausted their credit, they will quietly live at the expense of their tradespeople or of their friends \u2022 for they are in capable of conceiving, and still less of putting into practice, the feeling of independence and of personal dignity which causes other people to prefer the hardships of work to the burden of obligations. Yet if occasion offers for display ing physical or moral courage \u2014 a duel, a war, some dangerous expedition \u2014 those very men will appear in a very different light ; they will be grand, generous, and brave by the sole impulse of their own nature. They are capable of confronting the fatigues of a cam paign, of crossing Africa with Stanley, or of nursing cholera patients, and yet incapable of earning the fifty louis a month required to keep them without being under anybody's obligation. They are not alone to be blamed for that ; circumstances are greatly responsible for the evil. These unfortunate men are the victims of modern progress. Did you ever consider what misery the discovery of printing must have inflicted on copyists ? French noblemen are in similar straits. Formerly, the King's officers, D'Artagnan and Porthos of real life, were recruited in their ranks. Their great names opened to them the road to glory and fortune, and their swords were the only capital they needed to make their way. Though they had obligations to per form, they enjoyed high privileges. Nowadays, the demo cratic spirit of modern societies has abolished their monopoly. They cannot shake off such erroneous ideas as the class feel ing of the aristocracy, the prestige of their rank, and the fact that it is beneath them to live by paid work, which pre vent them from taking a new departure, and deriving an honourable livelihood from trade, industrial or literary pursuits. This is not, however, as easy to do in reality as some men are inclined to believe, seeing how prejudiced"], [124, "108 SOCIETY IN PARIS. most people are against the ability of the members of the upper classes. A great name is a burden to-day, whereas it was a privilege in the past. It constitutes a suspicious introduction to artists and business people. The disdain with which it is regarded is now justified to a certain extent, but I notice certain symptoms which lead me to think that the causes which justify it will soon cease to exist, and I rejoice in it for the future prospects of France. The discovery of printing ruined the prospects of copyists ; but some of these learned the handling of presses and the correction of proofs, and thus got out of the difficulty. The sons of the aristocracy will eventually follow that example, and the success of their endeavours will bear out the truth of an observation based on scientific investigation \u2014 of this undeniable fact, that men whose ancestors have long been possessed of intellectual culture are themselves eminently apt, as a rule, to intellectual pursuits, and only require special training and a certain routine to become versed in the knowledge of men and things. The aristocracy is still possessed of too much wealth, and that is the only reason that delays its entering on the path of modern progress, and serves to keep up the absurd prejudice according to which its members regard the legal or the medical professions, and commercial or industrial pursuits, as beneath their dignity. Impecunious members of the aristocracy frequently take wives from the wealthy middle classes, though now merchants are not so easily tempted into giving away their daughters and their fortunes to penniless noblemen. The growing wealth of the aristocracy is due, however, more to the increased value of landed property than to rich marriages. The increase of the territorial wealth of some families amply repaid them for the loss of the pecuniary advantages they formerly derived from royal favour. It is generally, though erroneously, admitted that the Revolution ruined the French"], [125, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 109 aristocracy. Owing to the doubts long entertained as to the lawfulness of the possession of national property,* the emigre's on re-entering France were enabled to redeem at a nominal figure their forfeited estates. Besides, a great many families retained their property, either because the proprietors were under age, or because they did not leave France. The estates of the Luynes family belonged to a minor. The chateau of Luynes was looted, that of Chateaudun was ransacked, but Dampierre, the splendid residence of the friend of Anne of Austria, did not sustain any damage, and the Touraine and Picardy estates that formed part of the forfeited property of Marshal d'Ancre, are now all divided between the five descendants of the Due de Luynes. The favour of French royalty brought wealth to the Luynes family. The connistablef was a soldier of only average skill and a statesman of doubtful abilities ; he was, however, an accomplished huntsman and a refined courtier, two qualities which made up his shortcomings in other respects in the eyes of his royal patrons. The Duchesse de Chevreuse, who brought to the Luynes family the wealth and credit of the house of Lorraine, was a lady of acute mind, strong will, and rather unscrupulous nature, and ruled as she pleased Anne of Austria, her frivolous and conceited Sovereign. As for Maria Leczinska, the scorned wife of Louis XV., she sought relief to her grief in the friendship of the Due and Duchesse de Luynes. It may be here remarked that, loaded with wealth and favours as the Luynes family was, it did very little for France and royalty in acknowledgment of the obligations it was under. Royal intimacy was the road to fortune for that family, its greatness being due to the peculiar talent its members * The lands and property of the hnigrte were confiscated by the Con vention, divided into lots and sold as national property. f A high military dignity under the old French monarchy."], [126, "SOCIETY, IN PARIS. 110 possessed of making themselves agreeable to Princes, and which seems a natural gift in that family. During the Revolution the Duchesse de Luynes, who was left a widow with an infant son, started a printing-office at Dampierre, where she published the philosophical works of the eighteenth century. The copies from the ducal press have now become very scarce, and are much prized by all book-lovers. Following in her steps, her grandson enriched the Dampierre Library with many precious books and manu scripts. He wrote some very conscientious essays on art in antiquity, and carried away by his enthusiasm for the study of Greek texts, he spent a considerable sum over a repro duction of the ' Pallas of the Parthenon,' after the description of Anaxagoras. Unfortunately Phidias is no more. Modern art follows the spirit of the age ; it cannot become archaical even to please a great nobleman, and the Minerva admired by visitors to the Dampierre Gallery is but a cold and colourless imitation, in no wise conveying the impression of the grand conception of Phidias \u2014 the maiden goddess, who bestows victory and protection, serene and sublime power, the source of universal strength and of all in tellectual manifestations, and who, for the Athenians, re presented the very soul of the country. The ' Pallas of Dampierre ' is the production of a scholarly fancy, carried out by a conscientious artist in accordance with the academical traditions of the Ecole des Beaux- Arts.* It lacks the grand inspiration of the ancients, and will be handed down to posterity only as the curious whim of a scholar. Being a great admirer of the talent of M. Ingres, the Due de Luynes made up his mind to induce that artist \u2014 so popular in the early part of the century \u2014 to paint the large frescoes of the Dampierre Gallery. The Duke was then on the point of starting on a journey to Syria, and proposed to instal M. Ingres in the chateau during his * The National School of Fine Arts in Paris."], [127, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 111 absence, and to afford him every facility to bring that capital work to a satisfactory issue. The artist would not, however, bind himself without having previously visited the chateau and examined the space to be devoted to the intended frescoes. Whilst ascending the main staircase he perceived the paintings recently executed by Gleyre, and about which the Duke had expressed his delight, for this production of the young artist pointed him out as one of the rising men of the new school. Ingres scornfully frowned, and refusing to step further, he told the Duke there and then that, not wishing to see anybody else's work in the vicinity of his own \u2014 whether out of jealousy or contempt for the talent of his brother artist he did not say \u2014 he insisted on the destruction of Gleyre's work before beginning the said frescoes. His Grace de Luynes ought never to have acquiesced in such an act of vandalism, and, at the same time, such an unwarrantable proceeding towards the artist who had so nobly and conscientiously devoted his talent to the task involving on him. Those frescoes of Gleyre were indeed masterpieces ; he never did as well afterwards. At first the Duke protested, but, infatuated with the desire of securing some capital work by his favourite artist, he eventually gave way to the unjust and mean jealousy of Ingres, and gave orders for Gleyre's fine paintings on the staircase to be whitewashed. Gleyre never complained of that treatment, but the grief it caused him had a deplorable influence both on his health and talent. His susceptibilities as an artist were wounded to the quick ; Ingres' failure at Dampierre was no comfort to him, and he never got over the blow inflicted on him by the Duke's unjust measure. M. Ingres, having secured his terms, immediately set to work and made a rough sketch of his work. But the Duke was no sooner gone on his travelling tour than M. Ingres' zeal cooled down \u2014 so much so, that on the Duke's return to France only one of the frescoes was begun. On the"], [128, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 112 other hand, the artist's imagination was such as to depict nude personages living in a golden age under some tropical clime, whereas it was the rule, even in ancient times, for people to wear some sort of garment. That excess of archaism in a reception-room might have been regarded as a vulgar joke, and was not at all to the taste of the Duke. As for the artist, feeling slighted at the remarks of his noble patron, he replied rather rudely; a pretty lively discussion followed, which induced the Due de Luynes to dispense with the services of M. Ingres. In return for the hundred thousand francs * he paid the latter, the Duke only has the poor satisfaction of possessing the rough sketch of a picture which the most elementary decency obliges its owner to keep carefully hidden from sight. His Grace de Luynes was not always so ill-advised as regards the decoration of his residence. He engaged the services of Rudef for the statue of Louis XIII., which stands in one of the halls of the chateau, and is justly regarded as a masterpiece. The ' Penelope ' by Cavalie, which may be admired in the main staircase, is a charming and exquisite piece of sculpture. As for the restoration of the gardens, grounds, and grand court of the mansion, it was carried out with first-class taste. The Due de Luynes died from inflammation of the lungs, caught on the battle-field of Mentana. He had organized at his own expense the ambulance service of the Papal troops, and, notwithstanding his great age, so valiantly did his work that he fell as much a victim to fatigue as to disease. He was a very great nobleman, imbued with aristocratic prejudices, and so devoted to the cause of monarchy that he always longed for the day when he could sacrifice him- * About \u00a34,000. f The famous author of the matchless carvings on the Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile."], [129, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 113 self and family to it. That was the lofty side of the strange nature which he displayed in the details of everyday life, an incredible mixture of elevation of mind and vulgarity of manners, of loftiness in feelings and meanness in details. He was passionately fond of art, and devoted his leisure and a large portion of his income to scientific researches ; but the narrow spirit with which he carried out his noble aspirations is the only cause of his comparative failure. His qualities lived again in his two grandsons \u2014 the Due de Luynes, who, as already mentioned, met with a glorious death at the battle of Loigny, and the Due de Chaulnes, who also fought gallantly in 1870, and was seriously wounded at the battle of Coulmiers ; domestic troubles brought about his untimely end four years ago. He was universally respected, and had endeared himself to all who knew him. The Duchesse de Chevreuse, mother of those two noble men so cruelly cut down in the prime of life, is a noble and pious lady, who bears with resignation the trials with which it has pleased God to visit her. After the death of her first husband, the Marquise de Contades, her mother, became the wife of the Due de Luynes, himself a widower, and married her to the Due de Chevreuse, the son of her second husband by his first marriage. The Duchesse de Chevreuse became a widow early in life, and her prospects of happiness soon vanished before the graves of all those whom she loved. Her sad bereavement imposes new duties on her which bind her to this world, from which her sorrows had detached her : she must bring up the two children born from the marriage of the Due de Chaulnes, her son, with the Princess Galitzin* The Duchesse de Chevreuse is a brave and energetic lady, but it would be a great mistake to believe that she is * The dramatic circumstances that led to the death of that un fortunate lady, who, broken down by trouble and disease, was allowed to linger in the greatest distress, are still fresh in everybody's mind. 8"], [130, "SOCIETY IN PA RIS. 114 the stern and harsh person she was purposely represented to be for the benefit of a cause which needs not to be discussed here. She acted conscientiously, as it was her strict duty to do, and, far from having displayed excessive severity, or placed social and mundane prejudices above the dictates of Christianity, justice and charity, she was so far indulgent, meek and forgiving, as to carry her forbearance to an extent beyond which kindness to the guilty may endanger innocent people. I am discreet in my praise of that noble lady, seeing that all her life she care fully endeavoured to conceal her heroic virtue and painful trials, yet it was well-nigh impossible to speak of so sympathetic a person without paying the homage due to her. The title of Due de Brissac is now borne by an elderly gentleman, of kind, amiable and easy disposition. His eldest son \u2014 setting in this an example followed by the Prince de Broglie \u2014 intended to restore the ruined towers of the feudal castle of Brissac by means of the millions of Mademoiselle Say, the eldest daughter of the wealthy sugar-refiner, whom he married, and by whom he had a daughter. The wealth acquired by M. Say will have greatly contributed to give fresh lustre to three great names of monarchical France, for the Marquis de Brissac having died from the fatigues endured during the campaign of 1870, his widow married the Vicomte de Tredern, hardly a year after the death of her first husband. Subsequent events proved that there was no necessity to proceed in such haste to the conclusion of that second match, seeing that it did not procure unalloyed happiness to the new couple. The Vicomte de Tredern hails from Brittany. He belongs to the family of one of the heroic companions of Beaumanoir in the famous fight of the thirty knights.* * Jean de Beaumanoir, a Breton knight and supporter of the claims of Charles de Blois against those of Jean de Montfort, ally of the English, was defending the town of Josselin against a body of"], [131, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 115 Whether because of his having inherited the quarrelsome nature of his ancestor, or because the rather practical views entertained in the Brissac family were better suited to the ideas of Mademoiselle Say, his married life was not free from clouds. Of course, it is well-known that the most important commercial bargain in modern times, the sale of Paris to King Henry IV., was concluded by a Brissac, who received the price of it in hard and solid cash. This discordance of views between the couple eventually brought about a total misunderstanding, and life in common being no longer desirable, the Vicomte separated judicially from his wife. From that moment the old Due de Brissac came to reside with the Vicomtesse de Tredern, his daughter-in-law by her first marriage ; and the heir to the name, titles, and fortune of the Brissac family is now brought up under the eyes of his grandfather, and there is so far every prospect that he will be the fit representative of his paternal and maternal ancestors. The Vicomtesse de Tredern is a remarkably gifted lady ; her features are perhaps somewhat commonplace, but nature endowed her with a rare artistic temperament. She has a lovely voice, and possesses all the qualities of a professional singer. People have either indulged in excessive praise of, English troops who held Ploermel under the lead of Richard Brembro. Exasperated by the raids of the English, who, in spite of arrangements formerly agreed to, killed, despoiled, and carried away as prisoners defenceless merchants and villagers, Beaumanoir proposed to bring twenty-nine French knights with him to fight a similar number of Englishmen under the leadership of Brembro, an offer which was readily accepted. On the fourth Sunday in Lent (27th March, 1351), this Homeric fight took place. Both parties displayed the utmost gallantry, but Brembro having been killed, the English lost counte nance and were soon overpowered by their opponents. In the course of the action, Beaumanoir, who had received many serious wounds, asked some of the people who witnessed this gigantic duel to fetch him some water to quench the thirst which was parching his lips. Hearing which, one of his followers said to him : ' Drink your blood, Beau manoir, it will relieve your thirst.' And Bois ton sang (Drink thy blood) remains to this day the motto of the family. 8\u20142"], [132, "116 SOCIETY IN PARIS. or spread malignant reports about her, but the latter are as groundless as the former is exaggerated. She is an intelligent and energetic lady, of a rather stiff' nature, and displays too much scornful indifference for abstract subjects. Should occasion offer, she would be quite capable of performing a transaction similar to that which passed between the Due de Brissac and Henry IV., and she is rather inclined to believe that if Paris is to be bought it must be with all it contains. That is a great mistake. She is doubtless unacquainted with the worth of many things which, though it is not easy to fix their precise value, constitute, nevertheless, the most precious blessings of our poor mankind. But one cannot be an idealist at one's will, and the admirable virtuoso who sings with such masterly power Margaret's love or Sappho's grief, discloses to the eyes of her hearers, charmed and spell-bound by her great talent, an earthly heaven, with which she herself seems unacquainted. The Vicomtesse de Tre'dern recently gave the daughter of her first husband in marriage to the Prince Ernest de Ligne. The title of Due de Richelieu, like that of Uzes, is now borne by a minor. The Richelieu duchi-pairie was in herited by the nephews of the great Cardinal, and, thanks to royal favour, has been in the possession of the Jumilhac family ever since the death of M. de Jumilhac, State Minister of Louis XVIII., the clever negotiator of the treaties of 1814 and 1815. The present Duchesse de Richelieu was a Heine by birth. She is a frail and delicate blonde, full of lovely and childish grace. She has a brilliant intellect, whose witty remarks come out almost in spite of herself. As for her conversation, it is as sweet as the rising tide. Altogether she possesses the graceful and exquisite qualities which show woman to have been created par excellence in order to charm and captivate the ruder sex. One of her chief preoccupations is undoubtedly to dress herself with refined"], [133, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 117 elegance. She is a dreamer, and well she may regard life as a dream to her ; for though she may have met with one or two ill-disposed fairies, still she was born under a lucky star. The young Due de Richelieu is dark, passionate, and self-willed, as was his father, to whom he bears a great likeness, both physical and moral, which people are happy to notice. The Caumont la Force family is one of the oldest and most illustrious of the French nobility. Its present repre sentative is a perfect gentleman and a famous sportsman. He married Mademoiselle de Maille. The Due de Maille is an officer of infantry. He is a charming, refined, and very intelligent gentleman, and so fond of his military duties that he is seldom seen in Paris. The Due de Clermont-Tonnerre has reached a very ripe age. His son is passionately fond of music, and his favourite instrument is the violin. That aristocratic Paga nini has devoted his life to his family and to his ' Stradi varius.' He is very seldom seen in society ; drawing-room successes are not his ideal aim as an artist. He married Mademoiselle de Moustier, whose father was French Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Empire. The Gramont's is the most handsome family of the French aristocracy. This is perhaps owing to the fact that the two last dukes of that name married English wives of great beauty. Had he wished it, the son of Corisande* could have assumed the name of Vendomef and displayed on his carriage the arms of France with the bar sinister. The question is, however, did he possess one ?

At any rate, the Bearnais offered Gramont the privilege of royal bastardy, which the latter declined out of filial respect. He thought it sufficient to have robbed his gallant sire of his wife and conjugal happiness, without further robbing him of lineage, and he rested satisfied with being a Gramont. The name of Corisande is, however, dearly remembered amongst his descendants ; that name is borne by a member of every generation, and seems to bring with it the privilege of beauty. The lovely Comtesse de Brigode, sister of the present Duke, still keeps up that family tradition. She is a tall and handsome lady, full of exquisite grace and bashful reserve. Her black curly hair sets oft' her lovely neck, and her fine and proud features remind one of the Court ladies painted by Nattier.* She expresses herself with infinite charm. Her mind is well suited to inhabit a pretty frame ; it is shrewd, discreetly charitable, and full of pleasant, ready wit. The Comtesse de Brigode is free from the least affectation. She attracts people by her engaging manner. She dresses to perfection, because she is the very opposite of vulgarity or uncomeliness. The shade of sweet melancholy in her person, and breaking out in her conversation, makes her still more attractive. She has not yet, however, lost the illusions of life, and, although she never knew the joy of being a mother, she has lived perfectly happy, ever unacquainted with trouble, anxiety, or disappointment. Her natural melancholy \u2014 a frequent and contagious disease amongst most society women\u2014 should, therefore, be ascribed to deep and abstract causes, but not to any trial or misfortune. That cheerless disposition often proceeds from the flagrant discrepancy that usually exists between social * Nattier (Jean -Marc), a French portrait-painter, died in 1765. His best portraits are those of Maria-Theresa, Maria-Leczinska, and Mesdames Henriette and Adelaide of France."], [135, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 119 ways and manners and the moral and intellectual worth of the persons called upon to assume those ways. Social rules were devised for the collectivity, and though the maxims that dictate people's conduct and govern social intercourse may be excellent to keep up the required harmony and cohesion between the various members of society, they are apt to hurt and offend the feelings of individuals whose heart, mind, and nature are above the average standard. Those social rules will then cause an inward rebellion, which manifests itself by impatience of social constraint and exigencies, and the assertion of the claims of nature and private liberty. The struggle that takes place is con fined to the innermost being ; there is no outward sign of its going on, for the reason that really strong minds in stinctively refrain from acquainting the crowd with their intimate feelings. Sooner or later the balance is restored, and relative calmness follows the crisis, though there remains the conviction that these two contrary elements \u2014 independence of thought and a set of narrow and invariable rules \u2014 will never agree together. When people have reached that stage they feel no longer any interest in social pursuits, and lead a life entirely different from the occupa tions of society. They grow accustomed to the practice of a very quiet philosophy, free from any illusion ; but they submit to their disappointment so gently that they seem quite satisfied with their lot. It is easy to detect and analyze the incurable melancholy of such people. The Comte de Brigode is a handsome and proud horse man Avho excites universal envy. He is of silent habits, is quite conscious of his happiness, does not much care for society, and is very fond of hunting, because that pursuit enables one to indulge in dreams whilst galloping after a reality. His favourite forest is that of Folembray, famous by the love of Henri IV. and Gabrielle d'Estrees. Folembray belongs to the Comtesse de Brigode, the"], [136, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 120 Count's mother, now Baronne de Poilly. She is a cultured and intelligent lady, fond of art and literature, and her circle is the most interesting I know of, seeing that it is frequented by such men as the Prince Edmond de Polignac, M. Haas, the Marquis Philippe de Massa, Francois Coppe'e, Paul Bourget, and Barbey d'Aurevilly. There is a great likeness between the present Due de Gramont and his charming sister. He is handsome, intelli- gent, and of pleasant and obliging manners. He passed brilliant examinations, and the ability displayed at the beginning of his military career holds out the highest prospects. His first wife, the Princesse de Beauvau, having died after a years marriage, he married Mademoiselle de Rothschild, by whom he has three children. The present Duchesse de Gramont has very strong Semitic features, but her superb dark eyes, her white and regular teeth, her graceful and lively manners, impart peculiar charm to her person. She is a very pleasant talker, and expresses herself with that elegant precision of language usual to foreigners of refined education. Society welcomed her heartily, and the reliance and charm of her acquaintance rapidly secured her numerous sympathies and warm friendships. She is an assiduous frequenter of all musical parties given by society ; besides which, she is quite conversant with literature, and modern scientific movements. Such a cultured and accom- plished lady can always fill in a pleasant and useful way the leisure time left by her domestic and social duties. The Due de Gramont and his wife give few parties ; the small and charming residence they occupy offers no faci- lities for grand receptions, and its doors are only thrown open to a select and limited number of intimate acquaintances. The Due de Lesparre, the brother of the Due de Gramont, married Mademoiselle de Conegliano. He is tall and fair, and premature baldness makes him look older than his eldest brother, but his features display the beauty of the family type. The Duchesse is a pretty little woman, full of"], [137, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 121 the lovely bashfulness of a school-girl fresh from the semi nary. The least thing arouses in her the artless wonder ment of newly-married ladies, and the delightful naivete of her remarks is truly entertaining. The Comte Alfred de Gramont is the most handsome fellow in the family. He is in the army, and discharges his duties with a zeal which points out that he has in herited that warlike passion of his race, which, however, amidst the dulness of garrison-life, soon vanished from his two brothers. He married Madame Sabatier, the daughter of a former French consul to Egypt, who displayed so much intelligence and energy in spreading the influence of France on the banks of the Nile. From her father, the Comtesse de Gramont has inherited a superb mansion, filled with curio sities from the East. There sphinxes look majestically upon mummies ; and when some party lends animation to that fine residence, the Pharaohs of old gaze with empty eyes on the young, handsome, and merry couples passing round and round to the tune of the band, and the relics of the past contrast strangely with modern gaiety. The two ducal families of which I am now going to speak are indebted to women for their fortune. The Mortemart family owes its greatness to Madame de Montespan ; that of the Noailles is due to Madame de Maintenon. Thanks to the protection of those two mighty feminine influences, each family was in turn the object of Louis XIV.'s favours ; and \u2014 what is eminently moral \u2014 the secret marriage bestowed more favours, honour, and wealth on one family than did the triumphant adultery. The Noailles family comprises three branches ; of which the Due de Noailles, the Due de Mouchy, and the Comte Alfred de Noailles are the respective heads. The Due de Noailles is a nobleman of the ancien regime. He has the grand manners, the high intellectual culture, and all the outward qualities and inward feelings of a per fect gentleman of the old school. He has erudition and"], [138, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 122 literary abilities, and is the author of several papers on political economy, which appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes, and of an essay, in two large volumes, entitled ' Cent ans de Democratic aux Etats-Unis,' and recently published. His style is rather dull, and the depth of his remarks or the originality of his views do not completely repay his readers for the strained attention required from them. A brilliant talker, as the Due de Noailles is, it is singular that his style should be so didactic, and that his sentences should never reflect the charming, pleasant, and witty turn of his mind. Altogether he has winning powers of conversation, but his writings are scarcely entertaining ; and the well-known proverb, 'Le style c'est l'homme,'* does not apply to him at all. Besides, perfect similarity seldom exists between the same thoughts when expressed in writing or in speech ; in the majority of cases one of the two modes of expression is superior to the other, and is used at its expense. The conversation of Theophile Gautier was bright to excess; his prose does not display so many gems, but what there is of them is set in with marvellous effect. George Sand, so eloquent and full of passion at her desk, became absent-minded as soon as she was in society : the thought that gave life to her pen, only broke forth in the course of intimate conversation with her private friends. But when she grew excited in defence of some argument, her persuasive and vibrating voice plainly possessed the same power as the sympathetic and communicative warmth with which she excelled in depicting her characters. Were the Due de Noailles to write as he speaks, he would be a second Saint-Simon, superior even to the great historian, for his mind is quicker, not so easily impassioned, and will more readily detect the ridiculous side of people's failings, and harmlessly make fun of them, whereas the austere friend of Fenelon would in such cases have vented his indigna tion by denouncing such failings in masterly style. The * M. de Buffon's ' Discours sur le style.'"], [139, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 123 judgment of the Due de Noailles is as shrewd, though not quite as lofty, as that of the satirist of the Court of Louis XIV. : he lacks, however, the deep philosophy which makes the ' Memoirs of Saint-Simon ' a study of human character as well as a valuable source of historical information ; on the other hand, were the Due de Noailles to write his memoirs \u2014 this is, unfortunately, but a dream, which will never be realized \u2014 they would not be wanting in lightness and delicacy of touch or in originality of views. The Due de Noailles will, doubtless, be some day elected to a seat in the Academie Francaise, because of the rule according to which the French aristocracy must be represented amongst the forty. Some time ago, whilst witnessing the reception of M. Herve, and listening to the discreet praises of his father, he had the opportunity of choosing the seat where he will before long rest his ducal * immortality. The Marquis de Noailles, his brother, married the beautiful Countess Schlekowska. He is the author of a voluminous work on Poland, and was some time ambas sador of the French Republic in Constantinople. The fact that he chose for his model the very one amongst his ancestors who took the initiative of burning his titles of nobility on the altar of the mother country has raised a certain amount of ill-will against him in society. Were the Marquis de Noailles to be compelled by logic to follow closely the conduct of his grandfather, he would certainly be much vexed, and would probably disclaim his model. The Due de Mouchy is very different from his cousin. Having lost his parents when but a youth, he was early in life left free to act as he pleased, and to dispose of his large fortune; the consequence of which was that he set aside the traditional opinions of his family, and was one of those who allowed themselves to be attracted to the Tuileries, and who, after being won by the fascinating powers * Since the publication of this work in the original French, the Due de Noailles has been elected a member of the Academie Francaise."], [140, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 124 Napoleon III. possessed in so high a degree, eventually became thoroughly devoted to the Imperial cause. He was intimately acquainted with the Empress Euge'nie, and obtained the hand of the Princesse Anna Murat, at a time when the Emperor's power, having reached its fullest development, was about to decline. The Princesse was a lady of great beauty, of exquisite kindness, and of great ability and taste in all matters pertaining to society. She managed successfully to keep in the good graces of the Tuileries, and to win the favours of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, She did this very easily, owing to the natural desire she felt of living on pleasant terms both with her family of the imperial palaces and with her equals in the drawing-rooms of society. The Duchesse de Mouchy is a generous and trusty friend ; her loyal attach ment to the misfortunes of her august mistress has made her name famous, and the universal sympathy she enjoys is enhanced by the admiration she so justly inspires. Years have gone by without leaving their mark on her fair beauty. Her son has reached the age of manhood, but she is still a young-looking woman. Her house is one of the most pleasant in Paris. She receives with friendly grace her numerous visitors, who are always delighted at the welcome accorded them. The Due and the Duchesse de Mouchy are fond of society, and feel indebted to the good Samaritans who come to visit and enliven their home. When people are con versant with all the rules of society, they are generally and imperatively driven to frequent it, and almost feel it an absolute necessity to do so. There is a certain weakness in fearing retirement to the extent of considering loneliness only next in horror to the infernal regions. Mixing with society entails, no doubt, a certain tyrannical subjection ; but it is a pleasant bondage, full of attraction, and offering substantial advantages. The only pleasant society is that of people who are fond of it. In order to attract, delight,"], [141, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 125 and entertain people, one must also feel attracted, delighted, and entertained by the occupation of gathering and amusing a circle of friends, and even of mere acquaintances. Such feelings cannot be assumed; the keenest ability will fail to obtain in that case the result secured by the natural love of society. People rather mistrust those who can do without them, whereas they will do anything to please those who candidly confess their inability to carry alone the weariness of life. That is one of the surest means of winning general good will. Life is fond of antitheses, and delights in contrasts. Nothing so captivates frivolous people as to feel they are really of some use. The Comte Alfred de Noailles is very much liked by all members of society. His kind and cheerful humour and playful gaiety have made him universally popular. His eldest son, the Comte Alexis de Noailles, inherited those attractive qualities. He and his next brother are serving in a horse regiment. The Mortemart family is noteworthy for having carefully preserved the classical manners of the old French society. It is still imbued with the spirit which the French nobility brought back with it on its return from emigration. Its members submit patiently to the misfortunes of the time. Being no longer able to serve the King, they served God and assisted the poor, and quite trusted to heavenly in terference to remedy the shocking perturbation which since 1789 has existed in this unfortunate sublunary world, so dis turbed by the irruption of modern ideas. That is exactly the attitude of the Mortemart family, now represented by the Duke, the Marquis, and the son and grandsons of the latter. They have kept away from public life, never courting the favours of universal suffrage, and limited themselves to the discharge of social duties and to the performance of works of charity. The young Comte de Mortemart married Mademoiselle d'Hunolstein the heiress,"], [142, "126 SOCIETY IN PARIS. on her mother's side, of a portion of the fortune of the Uzes family. This young and noble couple are very popular in society. M. de Mortemart is a handsome fellow, of pleasant and unaffected manners. He is sufficiently imbued with the ideas of his family to have resisted certain temptations to which as a rule youth gives way too freely. But he lacks that something which may be termed ' the sap of life.' Nature intended his body to shelter an energetic and ardent soul ; but the effort was too great, and could not be sustained until the spark that was to kindle the manly ardour and ambition of that body could be lit up. Reading historical papers, going to dancing parties, buying knickknacks, and superintending the decoration of his rooms, fill up the time of a nobleman whose faculties could be better employed. It is certainly high time to shake off the dust of Coblentz,* and to join in the struggle to defend the cause of a social order now so seriously threatened that indifference or inaction can no longer be countenanced on the part of those who are born its natural defenders. The Due d'Harcourt is of medium height ; he is a genial gentleman, and his wife, ne'e De Mercy-Argenteau, well deserves the reputation she enjoys of being a lady of much wit. She leads a retired life, and has devoted herself to the education of her sons and to the restoration of the superb chateau of Harcourt, in Calvados, in which latter occupation she displays as much competence as taste. The Due d'Harcourt had a seat in the National Assembly, and his rare ability in dealing with all military questions attracted universal notice. The Comte Pierre d'Harcourt, his brother, married the sister of the Comte Albert de Mun, the famous champion speaker of the Roman Catholic party in the Chamber. The young Comtesse is a very bright and intellectual lady ; the * That is, to shake off old-fashioned prejudice, such as existed, during the Revolution, at the Court of the Comte de Provence (after wards Louis XVIII.) in Coblentz."], [143, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 127 brilliant and easy manner in which she expresses herself imparts peculiar animation to her irregular features. She and her two sisters, the Duchesse d'Ursel and the Comtesse de Franqueville, are amongst the best lady talkers of Paris society. The Fitz-James' family is very large. It seems as though a witty and kindly-disposed fairy and a wicked and im provident one both presided over its destinies. All its members, the Due de Fitz-James included, are remarkable for their brilliant powers of conversation, their paradoxical spirit, and their utter indifference to the temporal advantages so much in favour nowadays. They are more feared than liked in society, and yet enjoy a certain fame, owing to which their company is much prized and sought for whenever they condescend to discharge their purely social duties \u2014 which, indeed, they seldom do, owing to their independent and whimsical character. The Duchesse de Fitz-James is the daughter of the Count Lowenhielm, who was for a long time Minister of Sweden to France, and left behind him a very sympathetic remembrance in his adopted country. She is a lady of great culture and distinction. She is passionately fond of agriculture, and devoted herself to it most successfully. She contributed to the Revue des Deux Mondes several papers on special matters connected with land-farming, and respecting which she has become specially competent. She used to be very fond of horses, and a few years ago she was, with the Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild, to be seen daily riding in the Allee des Poteaux.* The Vicomtesse de Turenne, her daughter, inherited her literary abilities. She is the authoress of a series of thoughts and maxims, which was published in book-form under a scarcely-veiled pseudonym, and enjoyed a certain amount of success some two years ago. Her fine and * A fashionable resort in the Bois de Boulogne, being to Paris what Rotten Row is to London."], [144, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 128 delicate features, her witty and playful mind, would make her unusually attractive, were it not that she spoils her natural gifts by a certain amount of affectation. The Due de Fitz-James has two sons, who are both in the army. The eldest is now in Tonquin ; the second is holding a commission in a horse regiment, and is the husband of Mademoiselle de Gontaut-Biron. The Dowager-Duchesse de Fitz-James, nee Marmier, was one of the most noted beauties of the Court of Charles X., and even now, at her advanced age, she still preserves something of the delicate and exquisite regularity of features, and of the grace and supreme distinction which won for her so much admiration. Her charity is inex haustible, and the serene charm of her indulgence, joined to her great kindness, draws to her parties young and old alike. Mademoiselle de Charette, her grand-daughter, is a lovely person. Her blonde beauty reproduces the fine classical features of her father and the refinement of her mother. Her movements are full of graceful abruptness ; her dark-blue eyes are sweet and deep ; her lovely youth, full of life and gaiety, casts a cheering light on the old age of her venerable grandmother. The Comte Robert de Fitz-James, first cousin of the Duke, is undoubtedly the most gifted of the whole family. He is a distinguished naval officer, and enjoys much con sideration in the career he has selected. His paradoxical and self-asserting mind is not calculated to win him people's sympathy, but they make him a curious character for study. I should fain advise him to cultivate idealism, in order to check the defects of his nature. If he were to acquire a greater taste for the abstract, and if the sphere of his thoughts were not so purposely realistic, his own feelings would be free from restraint, and he would be spared the trying effort of assuming eccentricities which are not in his nature. The most genial idea of the admirable Mar quise de Se\" vigne\" is certainly that of the faculty for unlimited"], [145, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 129 improvement possessed by human nature. That remark is very true, and that perfectibility is the reason why we for give the defects of men who have sufficient sense to be aware of them. The Comte Charles de Fitz-James is as intellectual as his cousin. His mental faculties are, indeed, brighter, though perhaps less excellent in quality. He is a fine talker, and will readily hit on subjects specially suited to the fanciful turn of his mind, and set off' their humorous sides with rare power of expression. A little more reserve on his part would certainly not occasionally be out of place, but his witticisms are so amusing and unexpected that he is easily forgiven. The Due de Rohan is a pleasant, sociable, and kindly gentleman, with a rather sarcastic though truly genial mind. His late wife was the daughter of the eccentric Marquis de Boissy, whose second wife was the Countess Guiccioli, famous for the passion her beautiful eyes kindled in the heart of the famous author of ' Lara.'* The Prince de Leon, son of the Due de Rohan, married the only daughter of the Marquis de Verteillac, who in herited the large fortune of the Marquis de Pre'aulx. Early in life he entered political life. He attends regularly all the sittings of the Chamber, where he represents the constituents of Morbihan, and displays in the discharge of his Parliamentary duties a zeal and an activity truly note worthy. He is a man of great culture, whose intellectual attainments are more solid than brilliant, and whose judgment is remarkably sound. The Princesse de Leon, his wife, is the embodiment of o-ood grace itself. Her communicative gaiety, the perfect simplicity of her manners, the pleasant and unaffected turn of her conversation, make her one of the most attractive ladies of society. Hers is a very hospitable house, and she does the honours of it with a grace full * Lord Byron. 9"], [146, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 130 of attention. She is more lively than prepossessing in looks ; she dresses well, and wears with perfect good taste the superb jewels she inherited from her family. Her lovely home is the abode of wit and simplicity. It is worthy of remark that in France people of high birth are seldom haughty and vain. When you meet there with persons punctilious as to the way they ought to be treated, and always afraid not to receive the attention to which their rank entitles them, you may take for granted either that they are sham aristocrats or that a misalliance introduced plebeian blood in their veins. True-born gentlemen are extremely polite, and full of attention and tact. But by means of almost imperceptible, but elegant and effective, shades of civility, they enforce the observance of the distance existing between themselves and their inferiors. True-born ladies have pleasant and winning manners, and those who preserve the tradition of good education display infinite grace and ability in the various degrees of their politeness. They possess the secret of never saying either more or less than they ought ; they keep a certain distance, which gives still more value to their amiableness, and makes it all the more flattering to the person to whom it is addressed. It is not easy to practise the art of applying those shades with perfect simplicity, and the total absence of constraint or affectation, and yet ladies thoroughly conversant with that difficult art are to be met with daily in society ; but that talent was handed down to them by their mothers, whose example imbued gradually the supple natures of their daughters. All French ladies do not, of course, possess that talent in the same degree; some, however, possess it to perfection, and in a degree which is certainly unequalled by the ladies of any other European society. The title of Valentinois is borne by the son of the Prince of Monaco, who, having entrusted the government of his"], [147, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 131 diminutive realm to the enlightened care of the Baron de Farincourt, Governor of the principality, spends his time either in cruising on board his magnificent yacht, or in enjoying life in Paris, where he owns a fine residence, or on the lovely Marchais estate. His father, now very old and nearly blind, is very fond of the latter place, where he spends the greater part of the year. As agreed at the time of the negotiations relative to the marriage of the young Prince with Lady Mary Hamil ton, both father and son bear the title of Prince of Monaco. The grand- daughter of the favourite niece of Napoleon had, it is said, been betrothed to the Prince of Hohenzollern, whose unfortunate candidature to the throne of Spain was the cause of, or rather the pretext for, the war of 1870. The German highness did not at all suit the young lady, accustomed to the independence peculiar to the education of women in England ; she therefore dragged on the negoti ations, and, when the Prince de Monaco solicited her hand, her marriage with the latter was concluded with unusual haste. Three years after a difference arose between the young couple, and the ties of matrimony having been broken by mutual consent, both recovered their liberty. The Napoleon of that not at all disconsolate Josephine is, it appears, on the point of trying again his matrimonial luck. The Prince of Monaco is better known by the unfavour able impression resulting from that unfortunate adventure than by his personal qualities. He has, however, applied himself with a certain success to scientific investigations. Without judginghim on the numerous allegations adduced against him by the counsels of the Countess Festetics, I should think that that new Menelaus was ill-suited to satisfy the demands of his Helen. He is a quiet and almost beardless youth, and has far more taste for learned conversations than for gallant speeches.

The ducal branch of the Choiseul family, that of Stain ville, became extinct in the Marmier family, whose head was authorized by King Louis-Philippe to resume the title. The present Due de Marmier is a distinguished music lover and a talented sculptor. After the death of Made moiselle le Marois, his first wife, he married Mademoiselle de Moustier, whose father was Chief Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Empire. He spends most of his time in the superb Chateau de Rey, which he restored with unusual magnificence, and is situated on a hill on the banks of the Saone. The Chateau de Scey-sur-Saone stands on the opposite side of the river, and the inhabitants of the place still relate a tragic love - affair \u2014 very similar to the un fortunate adventure of the Chevalier de Coucy with the Lady of Fayel \u2014 which happened in olden times, and was the cause of a deadly feud between the families of the two manors. The name of Marmier is popular in all the province, where every squire or big farmer still remembers with pride that some ancestors of his were present at the heroic defence of Huningen. During the campaign of 1814, the Marquis de Marmier solicited from the Emperor the per mission of raising a whole regiment at his own expense, in order to defend against the foreign invaders the small stronghold protecting the frontier of the province. He shut himself up in the small city and energetically held out to the last. The brave troops preferred to eat cats and rats rather than surrender. Their heroism fully justified the claim of the valiant little city to remain French, and the Due de Richelieu was disposed to do everything in his power to prevent the cession of Huningen by France. But, alas ! Louis XVIII. paid no heed to the request ot his"], [149, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 133 minister, and the gallant garrison was obliged to leave the fortress, though with the honours of war, with drums beating and colours flying, yet with a full heart at the thought that the city they had defended so well was given up to the allies ! This brave conduct secured for the Marmiers a commanding position in the province, and although it cost them their fortune, it has imparted peculiar and everlasting fame to their name. I have already mentioned, my dear friend, the Due de Bisaccia, who belongs to the Doudeauville branch of the La Rochefoucauld family. His eldest brother bears the ducal title of that branch. The Due de la Rochefoucauld is a captain in the army, and the head of the family ; he is the son of a butler ' married by mistake,' as remarked by one of my wittiest friends. The Comte Hubert de la Rochefoucauld, one of the Duke's cousins, is a mere youth, rather good-looking, but whose tastes are certainly strange, to say the least. His chief claim to the attention of the public lies in the marvellous agility he displays in performing acrobatic feats at Molier's Circus, and upon all occasions when he can exhibit the singular talent of which he is so proud. His brother is an officer in a cavalry regiment, and married Mademoiselle de Vaufreland. The numerous Estissac family is also a branch of the La Rochefoucaulds, and has had the honour of giving two wives to the illustrious Borghese family. Of all its members the Comte Aimery de la Roche foucauld is the best known and the most liked in Paris society. He has devoted himself from his youth to the discharge of his social duties, and they now constitute his sole occupation, his great passion, his career, the only aim of his life. It is fortunate that prophets so deeply convinced of the usefulness of their social mission are to be found occasionally, for they kindle and keep up kindly feelings that lend peculiar charm to social relations."], [150, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 134 The Comte Aimery has made a special study of the amount of attention and politeness to which people are entitled according to the rank they occupy. He has decided how many steps he must advance in his drawing-room when receiving a duchess ; he knows what number will satisfy a marchioness. As for a simple untitled lady, he will merely bow as a matter of gallantry. He delivers oracles in cathedrd and ex cathedra concerning the degree of respect people are entitled to claim, and has no mercy for persons guilty of neglecting to exact from their contemporaries the full share of honours due to them- Whenever an important dinner is given in Paris, the Comte Aimery never fails to acquaint himself with the names of the guests, and to decide beforehand what should be the order of precedence. Even cases about which the host has neglected to solicit his enlightened advice have been duly examined by the Comte, who has given a verdict from which there is no appeal, and if, perchance, matters do not take place in conformity with his decision, the arbitrator of social propriety will not fail to proclaim that the end of the world is at hand. He feels deeply concerned at such in conceivable subversion of moral order, and plainly foresees the imminence of the social danger it forebodes. Whenever he is invited to dinner, he calculates with wonderful pre- cision the exact moment at which he must arrive, according to the rank of the person who invites him. If that person is a prince of the blood, the Comte will arrive ten minutes earlier than the appointed time, but, if his host is a duke and peer, only five minutes. Upon his equals he calls exactly at the appointed time ; and upon people on whom he con- scientiously believes he is conferring an honour by accepting their invitation, and condescending'to sit at their table, a few seconds later. He is a regular St. Simon as regards etiquette, a diminutive Dangeau, a living handbook of heraldry. He knows all the alliances, the relationships, and the ins and outs of everybody, and is especially noted for showing up"], [151, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 135 the weak sides of boasted pedigrees. He deplores mis alliances more than a century old, and cannot forget some derogation to their rank indulged in by the forefathers of his dearest friend sometime in the sixteenth century, and the trace of which he has patiently followed through the course of bygone ages. He is a terrible demolisher of un justifiable pretensions, and there is reason to suppose that, before sharing the glory of heaven, he will wait until some saint of good family admits him to the abode of everlasting bliss. The maiden name of his wife is Mailly-Nesle, and the obscure points in her pedigree constitute a trying ordeal for the Comte, who considers it a severe visitation of God to have been deprived of the joy of tracing an uninterrupted descent which, if fully established and justified, would make the family of his wife one of the most illustrious in France. The Comtesse Aimery seems quite indifferent to the tragic events which affected her family in the past, and the recollection of misfortunes, now lost in oblivion, does not prevent her enjoying peacefully her personal successes, her pleasures, and the affection of her friends. She is a beau tiful blonde, and, but for a few trifling defects, would be perfect. Her mossy hair encircles her lovely and clear fore head, and her profile has the nobleness and the grace of some antique cameo. Her figure is not faultless, but her gait is sprightly and proud, her hands are delightful, and her bearing is admirable. She is much liked, appreciated and sought for, and has certainly a great deal to do with the forbearance with which society listens to the lectures of her learned husband. The Comte Guy de la Rochefoucauld is a very sym pathetic gentleman, and belongs to the family of the author of the 'Maximes.' He is far from suffering from the gloomy misanthropy of his ancestor, but is a charming young man fond of painting, sport, and society, and displaying both"], [152, "136 SOCIETY IN PARIS. taste and aptitude in his various pursuits. Life has been pleasant and sweet to him, and he takes it with the satisfac tion of a contented soul whose ideal is easily reached. His wife is a Mortemart, and has the bluntness of manners and all the eminently respectable preconceived opinions peculiar to her family. Apart from these trifling peculiarities, she is a lovely and intelligent woman, and has the tenderest affection for her husband, with whom she lives on very intimate terms, contrary to the rule prevailing in society. But it may be here remarked that, nowadays, it is con sidered fashionable for a wife to live on good terms with her husband. The eighteenth century introduced an ultra-liberal spirit in matrimonial life ; people got married in order to comply with social propriety, and having thus ensured the pedigree of their posterity, every married person followed his or her occupations and pleasures with thorough indifference as to the happiness of his or her partner, reciprocity of treatment making matters quite easy and natural. It took many generations to impart different views to men, and to bring them to understand the sweetness of marriage ties. Coterie spirit acted as a tran sition. Friendship was substituted for love, and vice versa. Every pleasant and intellectual woman was surrounded by wide and discreet sympathies ; every man possessed of qualities likely to be appreciated in intimate relations became a welcome and constant visitor to several circles, where he daily and faithfully contributed his share to the amusement and entertainment of all the members. It was not the rule to live in couples, but to be loved by twenty and sometimes thirty persons at a time. Every married person received in friendship delicate attentions and pleasures of good company the equivalent of his or her matrimonial bliss, singularly diminished and compromised by feminine or masculine intrigues which, under the circumstances, could not fail to take place. People seemed to share their happiness in common, strictly observing the"], [153, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 137 outward rules of decorum, but in reality prizing very little the intimate joys of home and family. The numerous publications recently brought to light, the memoirs and private letters of a great many personages, enable us to live again, so to speak, the daily life of such men as Chateaubriand, Vitrolles, Berryer, Ancelot, Benjamin Constant, and of such women as Madame de Stael, Madame Recamier, Madame Joubert, the Princess Belgiojoso, etc. Their exclusiveness outlived them ; and to modify the existing state of things, it required numerous money matches, the alliance of different classes, the taste for sport and races, the introduction of English manners in French society, and a corresponding disregard of the rules formerly obtaining with polite people, as also a certain decadence in the art of social relations. There still exist now certain circles much appreciated and frequented by some daily, and by others at greater intervals, where the subjects of interest are common to all visitors, where there reigns a certain amount of exclusive ness; and the chief attraction of which centres in a pleasant and intellectual woman, who considers herself more or less obliged to the people who form her circle and have amused or occupied her leisure for a number of years. But those intimate circles, last refuge of the coterie spirit, are fast disappearing ; they are denounced by those who were unable to gain admission to them, and their detrac tors gain daily more support and approbation. Those which vanish are seldom replaced ; at any rate, there is a marked decrease in the proportion of their masculine elements. Now, indeed, most young men follow a career ; the others devote their time to sport or racing, or to some artistic or literary pursuits. The clubs also take a large portion of men's time, although they are not so generally frequented now as formerly. The social duty of husbands is now limited to going out to evening parties in the company of their wives. The custom for newly-married people to pay"], [154, "138 SOCIETY IN PARIS. what is known here as visites de noce * is fast dying out. It is now a very rare sight to meet at afternoon parties a timid young wife in the company of her proud but embarrassed husband, and of an elderly lady paying the now old fashioned visit to all the leading salons of Paris society. There is now a growing tendency amongst men to free themselves from this, to them, irksome task ; and it is only in the provinces that husbands are to be found willing to accompany their wives when paying trifling visits. These new manners are plainly calculated to promote harmony and good understanding amongst married people. A wife can easily rule over her husband's heart when her rivals are the queen of spades, the service of Mars, or the saddle. Good homes are therefore plentiful ; and bad ones being fortunately now the exception, society judges with great severity persons imprudent enough to acquaint the public with their matrimonial troubles. People care little or nothing whether the apple of discord was thrown by the wife or by the husband, but dismiss them with a sound lecture as to how senseless they are not to live on good terms. Such views are becoming pretty general ; and the profitable business hitherto carried on by lawyers in the French divorce courts will soon come to an end. I have still to speak of the four ducal families which, under the ancien regime, were not provided with peerages, though their titles were hereditary. The Broglie family is one of them, and I have dwelt at some length on its different members. The title of Due de Lorge belongs to the Durfort family. Its present bearer is a good-looking young man, of pleasant manners but melancholy nature. There is nothing to pre vent him from looking at the bright side of life, of which he has been so far the spoilt child ; and yet his ideas are so cheerless and black as to induce the belief that it is some- * Visits paid to friends by newly-married couples."], [155, "THE DUCAL FAMILIES. 139 times very hard to have always enjoyed life and very irksome to have nothing to do. The other members of his family only bear the family name. One of them, the Vicomte de Durfort, married the lovely daughter of the Prince de Montmorency-Luxembourg, who gave him seven children. The Vicomtesse de Durfort is a very intellectual and sensible lady. Her manners are the very essence of good company ; and notwithstanding her strict regard for etiquette, the originality of her thoughts and the quickness of her intellect are such as to impart perfect charm to her conversation. The title of Due d'Aubigny was conferred by Louis XY. on the son of Charles II. by Louise de Keroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth ; it was intended as an acknowledgment of the English alliance, and still constitutes one of the titles of the Richmond family. The title of Due d'Estissac is, as mentioned above, the property of one of the branches of the La Rochefoucauld family. That branch is the largest, seeing that twelve of its present members are married. To conclude this long chat on the French aristocracy, I must confess to you, my young friend, that the gospel of polite society in France contains a rule nowhere else accepted, and which sets forth that it matters little what titles a gentleman possesses so long as he is a gentleman by birth. Kings made noblemen, but God created gentlemen. A nobleman may be a very mean gentleman, and as such will not be considered by his class as the equal of certain country squires whose names are simply preceded by a ' de.' The great point is not, indeed, to have enjoyed royal favours, but to be of good fame and ancient lineage ; that is what people in France call being of good family."], [156, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 140 FIFTH LETTER. DUCAL FAMILIES WHOSE TITLES ARE FOREIGN OR OF RECENT CREATION. I intended, my dear friend, to cut short this dissertation on the French aristocracy. I find it, however, impossible not to mention the dukes bearing foreign titles or of recent creation. They are as much entitled to wear strawberry leaves as are dukes possessed of peerages, and amongst them are to be found the descendants of some of the oldest French families. There are, in the first instance, the papal dukes, thus named because their titles date from the residence of the popes at Avignon. Such is the origin of the present titles of Sabran, Gadagne, and Caderousse. The Due de Sabran belongs to the Ponteves family, and the magnificent Lac estate he possesses in the neighbour hood of Carcassonne has been in the family\" since the days of Philip the Fair. After the death of Mademoiselle de Luynes, his first wife, he married the Countess Kalnoky, sister of the eminent Austrian statesman, and now resides part of the year in Paris and spends the remainder in Vienna. He is an ardent Legitimist, and has now constituted himself the dauntless champion of religion. He brought up with admirable care the only daughter he had by his first wife, and married her to the young Baron de Lareinty, son of the senator of the Department of Loire- Inferieure. That marriage was delayed for a long time, for the young people had to wait two years before obtaining the paternal consent that enabled them to carry out their wishes. Love matches are the exception in French society. To marry simply for love and without any regard for the advantages that arise from rank or fortune, is considered as a breach of social etiquette. Far from"], [157, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 141 admiring and commending such disinterested conduct, society blames it, and regards it as ill-boding for the future happiness of the newly-married couple. Experience unfortunately bears out what at first sight may seem a rather severe judgment. Kings too often get tired of shepherdesses, and princesses of their shepherds. A mun dane philosopher being consulted by a would-be husband as to the prospects of his matrimonial felicity, replied to the delicate question, which had been couched in a style borrowed from Panurge : ' My dear boy, some cuckolds there must be !' The same thing may be said of love matches. It is impossible for every generation not to reckon two or three individuals who, whether they wish it or not, will act in opposition to the manners of their time and society. Such matches are, as a rule, very unfortunate ; they give rise to abnormal situations, and substitute a selfish concern for personal happiness to class or family spirit, private to general considerations. In order to secure happiness here below, we must aim neither too high nor too low. Birds that build their nests on the tops of trees expose them to the blasts of the storm ; those who build on the lower branches run the risk of becoming the prey of ferrets and other nightly prowlers. One must be rash indeed to throw off a tradition and rely on abstractions, when all that surrounds us is built on realities. Society matches are far from romantic. There is generally no love at the outset, but as French girls are brought up to great purity of sentiments and a jealous care of their respectability, that feeling comes after marriage. Of course, there are cases in which hearts remain obdurate and cannot be brought to love the lawful partner of their life, and when those hearts belong to warm and affectionate natures, some fatal opportunity where virtue will fail may present itself; then, I must confess, everything is possible, and yet, how do we know ? Of all proverbs, that which says that there is no smoke without fire, is, undoubtedly, one of the"], [158, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 142 most untrue. People in general are very bad judges of such subtle and delicate questions. Their appreciation often rests on delusive, appearances. A most respectable woman may affect a certain freedom of speech and manners, which, on close observation, will constitute the plainest proof of her innocence. On the contrary, two beings, sharing mutually a true and deep feeling, will display marvellous skill in throwing off the right track those who watch them curiously, and will succeed in casting a deep veil over their clandestine amour. Reputation is, therefore, the most deceitful thing, and God, who fathoms men's hearts, must pity the silliness of all the would-be judges, according to whose stupid verdict some people are doomed to hell and others will share the joys of heaven. Prudent and sensible marriages generally prove capital matches. Provided that husband and wife be intelligent, the absence of the material cares of life and the birth of children \u2014 making the existing tie still closer \u2014 will be sufficient to keep up the harmony of matrimonial life, although mutual love may be wanting. Of course, this does not apply to the Baron Lareinty and his wife, whose happiness is complete in every respect. The Baron is a distinguished man, who, early in life, obtained a seat in the Cornell geniral of the Department of Loire-Inferieure, and will certainly succeed in securing his election as deputy of that constituency. He is a shrewd and discreet man, and full of foresight. He is not one of those gentlemen who consider dancing as unbecoming to their grave pursuits, but will, if need be, dance and think at the same time in order to attain his object. He knows the efficacy of uniting one's forces to secure one's end, and practises the wise policy of those who confess their fears and conceal their hopes. His character is free from astute ness ; he is not crafty, but is rather a clever player, cautious and bold at the same time. He is a living instance of the good results to be obtained by inter-"], [159, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 143 marrying members of the aristocracy with middle-class people, for his mother belonged to the Puy'segur and Castelbajac families. The union of intellectual refinement, of hereditary virtues, and of the love of the abstract for which the nobility is noted, with the dauntless energy and the desire for success which are the characteristics of the inferior classes, is a very sound measure. Modern science declares that natural aptitudes or tendencies are the fatal results of race. Hence the law of natural selection. Unconsciously our nature seeks the elements it lacks, and blends them together in the interest of our posterity. Sandeau* was wrong to leave us in doubt as to the true feelings of Mademoiselle de la Seigliere towards Stamply. She loved him, and it is natural that she should have done so. The older the world grows the more frequently will the different classes mix together. The Due de Gadagne is a perfect nobleman, married to a most amiable lady, whose descent cannot add any lustre to the pedigree of the representative of the Galeas. The present Duchesse de Gadagne is not exactly pretty, but by means of much tact and polite attention, she endeavours to main tain on a pleasant footing her novel position with society. The name of Caderousse brings to mind a host of merry recollections, and sounds much like that of the hero of some gallant adventure That name belonged to the eldest branch of one of the oldest families of France, that of the Grammonts \u2014 not to be confused with the ducal family already mentioned, whose name is spelt with one ' m ' only. The Grammont family comes originally from Franche- Comte', where its younger branch still possesses the superb chateau of Villersexel. The eldest branch settled in Provence, where it became the object of papal favours.

He was fond of the pleasures of life, and recklessly enjoyed himself, although he displayed such tact, charm, and exquisite manners, that his riotous existence was free from all vulgarity. He seemed to impart to all who approached him some of the proud distinction that lent exquisite charm even to the excesses of his reckless life of pleasure. He was a Lauzun in frock-coat, minus the ambition of the latter, a relatively virtuous De Riom, a kind of Canillac minus the Regent. His sayings went the round of the town ; people repeated them in the streets and in society ; they were full of ready wit, and very often deep and sensible. One day, in the company of his friends, he hissed a play that was performed at a small theatre, and this gave rise to an uproarious scene. The pit sided with the boxes against the actors, and, cheering Caderousse, called for him as though he had been an actor. On hearing this the Duke stepped to the front of his box and exclaimed, with a graceful bow : ' Gentle men, I feel flattered but not at all honoured by your cheers.' I might quote hundreds of other similar witticisms of which he was the author. He died at an early age from consumption, brought on by a cold caught from his having fallen in the river Marche. When he saw that his end was near, he invited his friends to witness his last moments. He treated them to a capital supper, made them as comfort able as he possibly could, cheerfully talked with them, and having received the last sacraments, died early in the morning like a Christian nobleman and with the stoicism of a Socrates. He lived like a rake, but died like a man. Several French families bear foreign titles. The Beauffre monts are Princes of Courtenay. They are descended from the Emperor Charlemagne in the female line, were created dukes by Louis XVIII., and one of the present representa tives of that illustrious lineage married the daughter of a Spanish infanta* The present Prince is a gentleman of * Princess of the blood."], [161, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 145 high culture, who takes deep interest in all historical questions, and is also a writer of great power, although his style is, perhaps, too solemn, a fault only natural in an author of his rank. He is as majestic as Prince Eugene, and his solemn appearance is as becoming to him as the armour of the knights of old, which seems heavy to us, but was worn easily by their owners. Grave, serious, and more imbued with the duties of life than anxious to share its pleasures, he is nevertheless kind and indulgent to others. The Princesse de Beauffremont-Courtenay is the last re presentative of the illustrious Aubusson de la Feuillade family. The Due de Beauffremont, head of the family, married Mademoiselle Leroux. That unfortunate marriage, of which there was no issue, gave rise to legal proceedings, which were largely taken advantage of by the scandal mongering press. His brother, the Prince Paul de Beauffremont, a general in the cavalry, now on the retired list, failed likewise to secure matrimonial happiness. The Princesse de Caraman- Chimay, his wife, finding her lot an unbearable one, took advantage of the marriage laws of Roumania, and, notwith standing the strenuous opposition of her first husband, has now become the wife of the chivalrous Prince George Bibesco. The trial of the Princesse de Beauffremont con tributed undoubtedly in a large measure to pave the way for the re-establishment of French divorce laws, and all the victims of unfortunate matches in France who have thus been enabled to recover their freedom may thank Prince Bibesco for that happy result. The Caraman-Chimay family possesses a foreign title besides that of French Duke, and owes its present lustre and wealth to the piercing of the canal of Languedoc by its famous ancestor, Riquet. Its foreign title consists in the principality of Chimay, in Belgium. As for the title of Due, it was conferred on it by the Government of the 10"], [162, "146 SO CIE TY IN PA RIS. Restoration. That family is composed of two branches, which are distinct since the close of the last century. The Due de Caraman is the head of the eldest branch. He is an eccentric gentleman and a hardened bachelor, and lacks neither wit nor erudition. His height is above the average, and he stoops slightly, with a swinging gait when walking, as though unable to manage his long limbs. He is absent-minded, and often speaks heedlessly whilst his thoughts are wandering ; he will then recover with a start, and lose his countenance in a most comical way on noticing the little journey he has just performed to the land of dreams. He lives retired, either in Paris or in Fontaine bleau, and it requires his strict sense of family duties to induce him to part, even for a time, with the delights of his secluded life. The Comte Maurice de Caraman, his brother, is the husband of Mademoiselle Arrighi, daughter of the Due de Padoue, and of Mademoiselle Honore, who left her a very large fortune. The young Comtesse de Caraman is a very simple and kind lady ; as for her husband, he is a perfect gentleman, whose average qualities are remarkably well balanced. Mademoiselle de Caraman is the wife of the Comte de Pange. They constitute a pleasant and amiable couple ; but, following the example of the head of the family, prefer home-life to society. The Prince de Chimay is the head of the younger branch of the family. He takes his title from his estate of that name, situated in the province of Hainault. When that estate passed from the hands of the Henin family into those of the Caramans, its former owners could not make up their minds to lose honours on which they set a great value, so they went to Bavaria, where they bought another principality. The present Prince de Chimay is a Belgian, and possesses the reserved manners and thorough good sense of the inhabitants of the banks of the Scheldt. For a long"], [163, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 147 time he resided in Paris, in the superb mansion situated on the Quai Malaquais, and Avhich he inherited from Mademoiselle Delaprat, his mother ; his grandfather mar ried the famous Madame Tallien, the reigning queen of the Paris salons under the Revolution and the Directory. The Prince de Chimay is the father of the lovely and charming Vicomtesse de Greffulhe. His wife, now de ceased, belonged to the Montesquieu-Fezensac family. She was a very handsome lady, of great talent and unusual intellect. Premature death took her away from the affec tion of her relations, and was the cause of universal regret. The Beauvaus are of ancient and illustrious descent, and besides their other titles, are Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Their present representative is a boy ten years old, grandson, on his mother's side, of the Vicomte de Gontaut, former Ambassador of France in Berlin. His father has been married twice. From his first marriage with Mademoiselle d'Aubusson de la Feuillade three daugh ters were born. Those ladies, of whom two are now dead, were possessed of unusual distinction and lofty intellect, and were married respectively to the Comte Robert de Mun, to the Due de Gramont, and to the Comte de Blacas. I have already informed you of the origin of the princely title of the He'nin fainily. The Henins came originally from Lorraine, and belong to an ancient race of warriors attached to the Court of the Dukes of Burgundy. The present Prince is married to Mademoiselle de Brienen. He was very handsome in his youth, and concealed under the reserved and affected pride of a nobleman the indolence of mind that enabled him to spend life as a dilettante. His two sons are married, one of them to Mademoiselle de Ganay, and the other to Mademoiselle de Brienen, his cousin. The former was an officer of great prospects, when he left his career in order to lead on his old ancestral estate, the feudal manor of Bourlomont, the life of a nobleman. The Henins are possessed of remarkably .good taste, and the young 10\u20142"], [164, "148 SOCIETY IN PARIS. Comtesse d' Alsace met in her husband's family with a love of art quite equal to that of the proprietors of the Hotel de Ganay. The ducal titles of recent creation were conferred by the Emperor, by the Restoration, and by Napoleon III. ; the monarchy of July did not create any. After having rebuilt society on a new basis, and recon stituted the clergy and the army of France, Napoleon created a new aristocracy. He was remarkably partial to the descendants of the old families, and his partiality in that respect was brought to light in the curious ' Memoirs ' of Madame de Re'musat. The perusal of the series of the Court Almanacks, from 1791 to 1830, is most instructive and full of lofty philosophical teachings concerning the fragility of human things. There we see the same names as titulars of the various dignities, offices, or lucrative charges instituted by the different regimes that succeeded each other during that short space of time. There are frequent instances where the same person, having obtained the erasure of his name from the list of Emigre's by Napoleon, accepted some office at the Imperial Court, a peerage under the Restoration, the same favour under Louis-Philippe, and ended his days as senator of Napo leon III. It would be easy to furnish instances of similar elasticity in principles and covetousness of public appoint ments. The greatest names of France appear amongst the dignitaries of the Imperial Court. The Baronne de Mont morency and the Duchesse de Chevreuse acted as train bearers to Mademoiselle Tascher de la Pagerie on state ceremonies, and had to put up with the rebuff's of the former protege of the Choiseuls, with the ill-humour of the former cadet of Brienne, who had then become the master of the destinies of Europe. The great man did not, however, find this a very easy task. Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Stael were"], [165, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 149 bold enough to teach him politeness. From that moment the members of the old nobility, whom his successes had gathered round his throne, fell into disgrace. He then began to create endless batches of titles. I will confine myself to mention those whose titulars still occupy a fore most position in society. The Murats take the lead in the Imperial aristocracy. The Prince Joachim Murat has solved the difficult problem of being universally liked. The Legitimists appreciate him as much as do the Imperialists ; and he enjoys the well deserved sympathies of every member of the French aristo cracy. He has been a most handsome man ; his two brothers, the Princes Achille and Louis, and his sister, the Duchesse de Mouchy, also inherited the personal gifts which made the King of Naples* so persuasive a victor. The Prince Murat married Mademoiselle de Wagram, and his children inherited the well-known irregular features of the Berthiers.f His son is the husband of Mademoiselle Ney, daughter of the Due d'Elchingen and of Mademoiselle Heine. He was a brilliant officer, of whose services the Liberals in the Chamber thought fit to deprive the country. He resided some time in Florence, in the company of the late Prince Imperial, and enjoyed great success in the poetic grand-ducal city. His large blue eyes, his light moustache, his romantic situation as the cousin and friend of the exiled Prince, played havoc with fair ladies' hearts. The melancholy gravity and the haughty attitude of the Prince Imperial made him less sympathetic to the Italian people, who get so quickly infatuated, and are so lavish in the manifestation of their feelings. Prince Murat has two sisters, the elder of whom is unmarried ; and the younger is the wife of Count Goluchowski, councillor to the Austrian * Murat, as everyone knows, conquered for himself the kingdom of Naples.

The Countess is delicate, pretty, refined, and amiable, without being what is termed a beauty. Her husband is a sturdy gentleman, of light complexion, whose general appearance much reminds one of that of German students. He is a very shrewd diplomatist, and excels in the art of knowing everybody's secrets and keeping his own. We shall probably see him some day as Ambassador in Paris. The family of the unfortunate Marshal Ney, the illus trious victim of the resentment of Louis XVIII., is now represented by the brothers and sisters of the young Princesse Murat, their mother having married the Due de Rivoli. The descendant of Massena is a gentleman now about fifty years of age, of a pleasant, cheerful, and communica tive nature. He played a leading part in the organization of the various entertainments which, during the carnival, make Nice the annual resort of cosmopolitan society. He represented Nice in the ' Legislative Body ' under the Empire. The Berthiers are represented by the Prince de Wagram, now the husband of Mademoiselle de Rothschild. He lived until the age of forty-five like a 'woman-hater,' as the English have it, and then fell madly in love with the pre possessing sister of the Duchesse de Gramont. He is silent and taciturn, and has much natural wit ; but a certain haughty bashfulness makes him unsociable. He has, however, much improved in that respect under the tuition of his pretty teacher. The Princesse de Wagram is a lovely and charming lady, with large blue eyes, a slightly arched nose, abundant auburn air, and the complexion of a tea-rose. She has a bright intellect, and expresses herself wittily, with the pretty drawling accent peculiar to German ladies. The Berthiers rank first in the Imperial nobility. The victor of Wagram was appointed sovereign Prince of Neuchatel and Prince de Wagram by Napoleon. Louis"], [167, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 151 XVIII. made him a Duke, but neither he nor his descen dants ever bore that title. He married a Bavarian Princess. His son is the husband of Mademoiselle Clary, the cousin of the King of Sweden. That family is thus allied to princely and royal houses, and reckons the Duchesse d'Alencon amongst its relations. M. Le Ray, son of the well-known stockbroker, who married the last representative of the ducal Abrantes family, towards the close of the Empire, has been autho rized to take up the extinct title, which thus revives in him. The widow of Marshal Suchet, Due d'Albufera, only died four years ago, at the ripe age of ninety-seven, surrounded by the affectionate care of her family, and having pre served to her last moment her bright mind and lively intellect. She was the sister of the Queen of Sweden, and every time King Oscar visited Paris his first care was to call on his venerable aunt. She was a diminutive old lady, sitting erect in her armchair, and welcoming with exquisite affableness her numerous visitors. She had a wonderful memory concern ing the features, the degree of relationship, and generally all the details pertaining to people with whom she was acquainted. She never made a mistake, and kindly in quired from each of her visitors about the health and doings of all his or her relations. Her wonderful faculties remained unimpaired until her death. She occupied the first floor of the fine residence purchased by her husband, and situated in the Avenue Gabriel. Her apartments were furnished and decorated in the purest and richest Empire style. According to the custom prevailing in her youth, she received her afternoon visitors in her bedroom, the blue brocade hangings of which \u2014 lavishly adorned with swans, sphinxes, and eagles' heads and pyramids \u2014 -were an exact specimen of the stiff and gaudy taste of the First Empire. She always accompanied her lady- visitors to the"], [168, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 152 hall-door, uttering all the time kind and amiable words, in a slow and meek voice. She seldom spoke of her recollec tions, fearing, it may be, to indulge a failing common to elderly people. The present was sweet to her : she lived its life, preferring to take an interest in what was going on round her to stirring the cold ashes of the past. Her grandson, the Due d'Albufera, is the husband of Mademoiselle de Cambaceres, whose mother was a Bonaparte Princess. He is a very kind-hearted gentleman, of great moral worth and affable natui-e. He has many friends, and not a single enemy. The almost simultaneous death of all his relations was a great blow to him. His sister, the widow of the Comte de Bonneval, is his only relation still alive. The young Duchesse d'Albufera is a splendid rider, and dresses to perfection. She wears her beautiful black hair simply plaited, and forming a thick chignon at the back of her head. Her beautiful eyes are full of expression, but her features are rather irregular. The Bassano family is noted for its attachment to the Empress Eugenie. They have devoted themselves to the consolation of that unhappy august personage ; and notwith standing his great age, the Due de Bassano is the constant attendant of the fallen Sovereign, to whose service he has exclusively applied himself. His son married Miss Symes, a lovely American lady. That Transatlantic beauty is exceed ingly wealthy, and possesses one of the finest pearl necklaces in Paris. She is kind and amiable, and discharges with much zeal and good grace the duties imposed on her by her marriage with the heir to the title of Due de Bassano. She goes every year to Farnborough, where she makes a long stay and is much appreciated. The Due de Bellune and his wife reside in Fontainebleau. The pretty little city, famous by the palace erected by Francis I., is much frequented by the Paris cockneys, who find there a summer residence within easy distance of the capital, and country life without its dreary loneliness."], [169, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 153 The maiden name of the Duchesse de Bellune is D'Espies. She is fond of society, and gives splendid entertainments. The private theatrical parties she organizes every spring are considered among the chief attractions of the Fontaine bleau season. The Duke is the author and composer of the plays performed, and acts as stage-manager and prompter besides. Writing plays and superintending their performance constitute in his eyes a real pleasure and a delightful occupation, which he follows with extreme pas sion, and to which he devotes the best of his energy. A couple of months before the day appointed for bringing out before a select public the work in the production of which he bas displayed his numerous talents, the noble author is busily engaged in writing verse, striking out passages, re placing them by others, and lecturing his actors without rest or mercy. He is a hero, and sometimes a martyr, of his passion for the drama. The Due de Massa has very similar tastes. He possesses remarkable talent as a musician, and gives performances of his works in the handsome theatre built by him in his Chateau of Franconville. He is very wealthy, and is still a bachelor. Unlike Louis XIV., he neglected, when young enough to succeed, to secure the hand of a Maria-Theresa, and does not yet seem anxious to meet the Maintenon whom Providence has undoubtedly laid in store for him. His first cousin, the Marquis Philippe de Massa, is a playwright to the backbone, who carries his fifty years of age more cheerfully than many a modern Fortunio does his twenty years. He is a very reliable friend, a most witty gentleman, and endears himself to all who are acquainted with him. His wife is not exactly pretty, but her delicate features are ideal, which, added to the lovely curls of her light hair, make her appear extremely young. She pos sesses the discreet charm of thorough and refined coquetry, and the taste with which she dresses is perfect in every respect. She is the willing slave of fashion, and delights in"], [170, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 154 exhibiting herself day after day before a select public, which indeed constitutes the chief occupation of ladies in society. Her exquisite grace is much appreciated by all who know her. The Due de Feltre is the husband of the sister of the Duchesse d'Albufera, a Bonaparte Princess, as already men tioned. He is a militant member of the Imperialist party ; and notwithstanding the fact that the political creed he professes is rather in favour of the principle of absolute power, he advocates some rather advanced ideas, and sup ports that medley of inconsistent opinions with ardent conviction. The Duchesse has nothing to do with politics ; her great object is to enjoy her young and beautiful self by indulging in sport and the other pleasures of society. She is most amiable ; her meek nature has no pretension to lofty intellectual aptitudes, and she is very proud of a fine child which was long expected. The Due de Padoue is an elderly gentleman, whose present wife is a young lady, the daughter of Admiral Bruat, whom he married two years after the death of his first wife, whose charity and other virtues are still present to the memory of all who were acquainted with her. He was one of the advisers of the Prince Victor when the latter fell out with his father, and assumed an indepen dent attitude as political heir of the late Prince Imperial. The great influence of the Due de Padoue, who was held in such high esteem in the intimate circle of Napoleon III., imparted much importance to the steps taken by the young Prince. People are, however, rather surprised at seeing a line of conduct open to discussion obtaining the uncon ditional support of a prominent personage enjoying such universal respect as the Due de Padoue. The title of Due de Montebello is borne by a child ten years old His family, accepting resolutely the progress of modern times, earned a fortune in commercial pursuits after* having won glory and fame on battle-fields. The"], [171, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 155 hero of the Italian war* inherited his taste for commerce from his own parents, who were humble traders in Lectoure. His wife was the daughter of the Comte de Gue'heneuc, whose own father held some office in the Court of Louis XVI. She always refused to be one of the ladies-in-waiting of Josephine, and only accepted the appointment of chief lady-in-waiting to Marie-Louise. She was on very in timate terms with the wife of Marshal Lefevre, notwith standing the vulgar manners of that good lady. One day, as the story goes, the two ladies called together at the palace on a visit to the Empress. The usher on duty having asked them for their names, ' Shut up,' solemnly put in Madame Lefevre ; ' and go and tell your mistress that it is Lefevre 's and Lannes' missuses that wish to see her.' The Comte Jean de Montebello, the fortunate husband of Mademoiselle de Briey, so celebrated in society for her wit and beauty, would not exactly agree with his grand mother, were the latter to come to life again and to make the acquaintance of her grandson. The latter is passion ately fond of decorum, and he is attracted by all that is bright and elegant ; so much so that, thinking that the democratic opinions of the Imperialists were not fashion able, he has gone over to the Royalist camp, where he was welcomed with all the readiness due to his rank. The Comtesse Jean de Montebello is not merely pretty; she is handsome. The broad and noble proportions which constitute beauty are seldom matched in the same being with the delicate, finished, and graceful details which im part prettiness to a woman. Besides, in order to be perfect, the blending together of those different qualities must be so nice and intimate that that peculiarly victorious and attractive power which constitutes the seductive charm of woman should emanate from the person and manners of the new Galatea animated by the divine breath. * Marshal Lannes, whom Napoleon I. created Due de Montebello, in recognition of the share he took in that victory."], [172, "156 SOCIETY IN PA RIS. Madame de Montebello fulfils the two first conditions above mentioned ; but not the third. There is no harmony between her physical and intellectual gifts ; she lacks the seductive power. It is not easy to explain why this is so. She is kind and very intelligent; has many friends, and leads a happy life, envied by everybody. She pos sesses remarkably good taste ; her lovely residence in the Rue Barbet de Jouy is a marvel of refined luxury, a master piece of home-comfort. Those results could only be at tained by a mind above the average. It is highly probable that the Comtesse de Montebello, fully realising how hollow and transient are the lying protests of society, never alto gether discloses her heart to its members, and that the tenets of her creed concerning home and domestic happi ness require of her to confide only in her husband. Such views certainly deserve admiration, Will there never be an Alfred de Musset to recite in fine and passionate verse a ' Never ' which the author of ' Rolla ' could never have heard from more lovely lips ? The Comtesse de Montebello gives frequent parties ; the charm of her bright, witty, and rather paradoxical conver sation is not the least attraction of her salons, the only drawback of which is a certain tendency to debate. To be a pleasant talker in society one must aim very indirect shafts, control one's passion, keep one's conviction to one's self, only indulge in sparkling and witty remarks, and enjoy sufficient elasticity of mind to pass easily from one subject to another. One has thus greater chances of suc ceeding in bringing one's company on ground where its members can display their own powers. One must never aim at personal success, but rather endeavour to furnish one's visitors with the opportunity of displaying their wit or talent, without their suspecting that they are indebted to you for the pleasure of having gained a success. Do people go into society in order to exchange their melancholy with that of their friends ? Certainly not ; people visit each"], [173, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 157 other in order to enjoy themselves. Then, for goodness' sake, let us give a holiday to the school-boys that we really are, and enjoy ourselves with the marbles, the tops, or the hoops of society ! Some people may object that we go into society in order to discharge a duty and keep up our social relations. But that is one more reason why we should merrily fulfil our wearisome task, and, as cheerful Midases, change into golden nuggets the sand of the hours we are obliged to spend in society. There is nothing so nice as merriment, and nothing to-day has so much got out of fashion. Gaiety points to a vigorous mind; it is the proof of a moral strength capable of resisting everything \u2014 the crushing weight of daily cares, the melancholy brought on by the passing hour that returns to nothingness, the notion possessed by every en- lightened mind concerning how miserably hollow and con- temptible everything is and has ever been here below, the imperceptible worry of every-day life, the plague of seeking happiness and the torment of misfortune. When a human being enjoys serene and continuous gaiety without fits or affectation, you may be sure, my dear boy, that he is a rare and fine variety of our poor species. Study him closely, follow the manifestations of his pliant mind, and acquaint yourself with that courageous toiler who cheerfully bears the loss of his illusions. I am much mistaken if you do not some day thank me for having advised you to do so. It is but a fact that gaiety is going out of fashion. We are passing through a phase of human thought where moral cripples make a show of their misfortune, and where sound minds, well-balanced intellects, feel as little at home as would a well-to-do bourgeois suddenly landed in a den of beggars and thieves. Contemporary youth affects, strangely enough, to treat life with contempt, to be tired of its pleasures, and to feel no interest in its serious pursuits. Indeed, it is hard to conceive how hollow and aimless the animal and in-"], [174, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 158 tellectual life of nearly the whole of the present generation has now become. That way of treating and of looking at life is, in my eyes, only the result of a whimsical fashion, with which young people are infatuated, and which will vanish as soon as one of them will take upon himself to enjoy life merrily as it deserves to be, in order to cure his comrades of that deplorable knack of discouragement. That pitiable art comprises various degrees, some young men affecting more or less contempt for the joys of life, and disregard of even its most sacred duties. The moral and physical activity of some of these people dwindles down to a mere nothing, and they behave like splenetics, or like persons subject to hallucinations, and seem as devoid of self-will as a man about to give up the ghost. Well intentioned young men wishing to be correct endeavour to follow the silly reigning fashion. But Providence made them full of life and vigour, and they are obliged to follow the impulse of their own nature. They do all they can, but fail to attain the aim they have in view, and only succeed in being dismal merry-andrews, grievous puppets. That plague does not rage with so much violence in women, and if you wish to indulge in pleasant conversation, you must frequent circles enlivened by the pretty tattle of some charming daughters of Eve. Seeing that this letter is devoted to the latter, I cannot do better than give you the sketch of a lady bearing one of the greatest names of the Empire, and who possesses to a rare extent that charm ing gift of gaiety, the necessity of which I am so anxious to advocate in the unfortunate society that stands in such great need of it. I mean the Comtesse de Trevise, a small, graceful and lively lady, whose type rather reminds one of the delicate figures of eighteenth-century art. The word ' lively ' seems to apply specially to her, and I should almost say that she is pretty, seeing how her sly smile pleasantly brightens her face, and how much charm and persuasion are imparted to"], [175, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 159 her features by the intelligent expression of her eyes. She is supremely good and kind, and practises with rare success the art of social conversation, the height of which consists in so managing things that the person with whom you have been talking will, on leaving you, think he has done wonders. That line of conduct will enable you to reconcile bores with themselves, to comfort melancholy visitors, to shame sullen and jealous people, and to enforce silence on slanderers. Women who have enough sense, and are sufficiently kind to adopt it, possess sweet and inexpressible charm. From the first day she went into society, the young Comtesse de Trevise was surrounded by the sympathy and affection due to the exceptional position occupied by her own brothers and her sisters-in-law. The Due de Trevise is the head of the family. He married Mademoiselle de Kerveguen, by whom he has no children. He is a most esteemed nobleman, of en lightened and liberal views, and enjo3'ed, under the Empire, a foremost position as friend and confidant of the Sovereign. That high favour was all the more noticed that the Due de Trevise, although bearing a title conferred on him by Napoleon I., might be considered as opposed to Imperial ideas, Marshal Mortier, his father, having so thoroughly embraced the cause of the monarchy of July as to become one of the most ardent supporters of Louis-Philippe's rule. The Marshal was one of the victims of Fieschi's outrage, and his death further strengthened the ties that bound his family to the house of Orleans. The marriage of the second Due de Trevise with Mademoiselle Gudin still in creased the attachment of the Trevises to the Orleans family. Through the course of their long existence the excellent and noble couple set the highest example of domestic virtues. They loved one another for forty years without a single dayr of weakness or neglect, and could not survive one another. Philemon and Baucis of society, their lives"], [176, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 160 ended together, and the grave closed over those two loving hearts in the same week ; Death, for once intelligent and merciful, soon relieved one of them of the grief of mourn ing the loss of the other. The Marquis and the Comte de Trevise remained faithful to the political preferences of their father. The former is the husband of Mademoiselle de Belleyme, a relation of the famous prefect of police. The Marquise de Trevise is an intelligent, kind and amiable lady, and notwithstanding the fact that her manners are not exactly as refined as might be expected, she has many friends in society, her obliging and discreet nature and her sympathetic and reliable character making her an invaluable friend. The Due de Plaisance is the second son of the Comte Armand de Maille', the deputy for Maine-et-Loire. He inherited his title from his maternal grandfather, whose good grace and courtesy were proverbial. He lately married Mademoiselle de la Rochefoucauld d'Estissac, who is not pretty, but graceful, shrewd and witty. I have still to deal with the titles conferred by the Government of the Restoration. On ascending the throne Louis XVIII. rewarded with titles and Court favours the loyal attachment of some of the faithful followers who shared his exile, and conferred the ducal titles of Avaray, Caraman, Des Cars, Riviere, on the four noblemen who formed the Court at Mittau. The present representative of the Avaray family is a gentleman about sixty years of age, who married Made moiselle Seguier. He never cared for the stormy life of a politician, and the intimate joys of domestic life were sufficient to fill his time. His two sons are married ; one of them is the husband of Mademoiselle de Mercy-Argenteau, the other that of Mademoiselle d'Hinnisdal. The first of those ladies is a person of rare beauty ; full of life, freshness and health, she reminds one of the por-"], [177, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 161 traits painted by Rubens, and cheers up our desponding age with her joyous, vibrating, and perhaps a little too self-asserting person. Her beauty is aristocratic and accomplished in every respect, but her mind is not so refined. She allows herself to be carried away by joy and by the impulses of her youth, and I have detected in her a love for reality in preference to ideal, which makes her rather vulgar and unpoetic. She sees the broad lines of this world, but does not grasp its fine details. Were I not afraid to appear too severe, I should liken the charm proceeding from that beautiful person to the loud notes of a brass band, after listening to which the sweet tones of the fiddles and flutes are a pleasant relief to the perhaps some what fastidious ears of lovers of music. The Comtesse d'Avaray is very different from her sister in-law. Though not regular, her features are striking and anything but commonplace ; her mind is lively and ready witted, her judgment uncommonly independent, and her principles are most straightforward. There is a certain piquancy in the contrast existing between great self-will and strong resolution and an unconventional mind. The Comtesse d'Avaray is very reserved, and seems, at first sight, not possessed of great powers of conversation ; but as soon as she speaks one is struck by the rare originality of her mind, and the degree of solid knowledge which, young though she is, she has managed to acquire. The Des Cars are ardent and loyal Royalists, and most pleasant company. Their family tradition consists in the practice of every virtue ; they are exquisitely polite, and of charming manners. As the head of the family, the Due sets the example of those fine and noble qualities ; the Comte Amedde des Cars, his brother, follows in his steps, and possesses besides the advantage of a very quick and somewhat incisive mind, as does also his son, who is the most wonderfully active gentleman you ever knew. You never meet him but he is in a hurry ; indeed, he 11"], [178, "162 SOCIETY IN PARIS. seems to enjoy the gift of ubiquity. His time is taken up partly by the duties of his military career, of which he is passionately fond, and partly by agricultural pur suits and by social obligations. He goes to all the society balls, and will stay until three o'clock in the morning; but the hour has scarcely struck when he disappears, leaps into his carriage, catches his train, takes off his evening dress and dons his uniform on the road, and makes his appearance at parade exactly at the appointed time. He possesses large estates and extensive farms \u2014 the management of which he superintends personally \u2014 and is a member of the general council of his canton.* Not withstanding those numerous occupations, he still finds time to watch over the education of his sons, and to keep one of the most brilliant and best-managed houses in Paris. His wife is a small and delicate lady, of fair complexion and girlish appearance, whose calm and serene attitude contrasts greatly with the hurry of her husband. The ducal titles of Talleyrand and of Decazes were con ferred in recognition of services rendered to the State. The Talleyrand family obtained the favours of nearly all the Governments that held power in France since the beginning of the century. The Bishop of Autun was a most interesting personage, living at a time when the most deeply-seated political creed and loyalty could not with stand the onslaught of events. He displayed more wit and ability, and less prejudice, than the majority of his contemporaries. He was the most perfect type of the accomplished nobleman of high birth, and at the same time a thorough libertine \u2014 a sort of impersonation of Voltaire, Richelieu, and Punch, constituting an altogether uncommon and peculiar character. His grand-nephews, the Prince de Sagan and the Marquis de Castellane, have inherited some of his intellectual gifts. * An administrative division of a French department."], [179, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 163 I shall deal with the Prince de Sagan in one of my next letters, and will now speak of the Marquis de Castellane. He is a very intellectual gentleman, of remarkable culture, aud succeeds with singular\" ease in carrying out all he undertakes. He entered public life at an early age, having, when twenty-five years old, been sent by the Depart ment of Cantal to the National Assembly. His maiden speech \u2014 on a question of foreign policy \u2014 attracted general notice, and at once won for its author reputation as a speaker. He did not, however, keep the promises held out by such a brilliant beginning, and his enthusiasm gradu ally cooled down ; clubs, society, and far less respectable circles soon attracted and completely engrossed his atten tion, and eventually swallowed up all his energy, with a result greatly detrimental to his present happiness and to the future prospects of his political career. What may be the cause of that complete change ? According to a certain Latin proverb, ' The best of things become the worst when diverted from their object ' ; and without applying that harsh saying to a person who still possesses much charm and worth, one cannot help noticing that people lose peculiarly by breaking off the habits of their educa tion, and by allowing themselves to frequent, in after-life, circles too widely different from that in which they were brought up. The Marquis de Castellane was brought up by his mother \u2014 a lady of very refined intellect and great virtue \u2014 in accordance with the religious and intellectual traditions of the Liberal Catholic party. At an early age he was smitten with the rather deceiving tenets, with the idle fancies and chimeras, of such noble souls and lofty minds as Montalembert, Cochin, Lacordaire, and Falloux. The dearest hope of that party was to bring about the reconciliation of modern scientific progress with Christian dogmas, by means of well-understood liberalism and of wise eclecticism. That was no doubt a very fine dream. 11\u20142"], [180, "164 SOCIETY IN PARIS. Unfortunately it shared the fate of all that is noble, rare, and sublime ; those who owed it most admiration and support turned it into ridicule and treated it with scorn. The Catholic party branded irremediably those who, taking modern scientific progress into account, had dared to try to reconcile the new social requirements with the respect due to tradition as embodied in religious ideas. One is never so thoroughly betrayed as by one's own people ; and from that abortive attempt which, at one time, seemed destined to be the grand and glorious beginning of a new flight of the human mind, nothing more remains but a few names and a few fine pages. . . The Marquis de Castellane was born in time to witness the solemn burial given by irreconcilable Catholics to religious liberalism. He saw the uncommon and curious spectacle of the brothers and supporters of the deceased trampling his grave in the company of his sworn enemies, and concealing under flowers of rhetoric the ill-disguised and real satisfaction they felt at the issue. That ceremony sadly disappointed M. de Castellane. and impressed him with the belief that poignant deception often follows the entertaining of some grand moral idea. Now bereft of the conception which appeared to him the only worthy aim of life, he found himself in the alternative of either sub mitting to fate or embracing some other creed. The grand nephew of Talleyrand made up his mind to seek another ideal, and being urged, doubtless, by some irresistible family impulse, his choice fell on a thoroughly epicurean philosophy, mixed up at times with some few scraps of his past belief. Our lost illusions should not for ever worry us with their recollection, and yet the}' do so. It is one of the characteristics of the human mind that it cannot change itself and assume a new life ; it transforms and modifies itself, but seldom rids itself of its past memories. Education leaves indelible traces, and family impulses always enforce the priority of their claims. Thence"], [181, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 165 arises a strange incoherence, unless those contrary elements be resolutely kept down by personal energy. At first sight it may seem paradoxical to charge with a want of individuality one of the few men of society who excel in the art of thinking, speaking and writing ; one of the most subtle and ready-witted minds which the salons of Paris may be proud of possessing. It is nevertheless a fact that these valuable gifts are neutralized by a want of sequence and logic in ideas, added to a certain want of energy. First-class characters undertake everything, adapt themselves to circumstances, and make use of the events of this world as tools to carry out their own aims ; they always leave their mark behind them, and receive little or no aid from outward causes. They proceed on their course, little minding adverse or favourable circum stances, but simply confining themselves to turn them to the best possible advantage. In the struggle for life, people should be armed in view of success, for victory is their ultimate aim. M. de Castellane will sometimes, out of pride, neglect to secure the benefit of his efforts, and then feels quite disappointed. This Grandison* of politics, transformed into a Valmontf of society, would, I think, succeed in literature. He has wasted his time in treading many paths. Is he still of the age when men are simple enough to\"6e fond of success, and show some appreciation for the esteem and admiration of their contemporaries ? One must believe in order to excite faith in others, and in order to become a talented novelist, it is not sufficient to have delicate and refined literary taste. One must be fond of writing, and be actually driven in that direction ; one must patiently apply one's powers to * The chief character of ' The History of Sir Charles Grandison,' the last of Richardson's important novels, here employed as the synonym of virtue and conscientiousness. + A reckless young man, the chief character of 'Le Comte de Valmont, ou les egarements de la Raison,' a highly moral novel by the Abbe Gerard, and said to be the history of his early- youth."], [182, "166 SOCIETY IN PARIS. form a personal language wherein to express one's own ideas ; one must teach that language to the public, and chiefly bear in mind that the generation for which one now writes is that which delighted in reading the ' Maitre de Forges.'* The titles of the Talleyrand family are now borne by the Due de Valencay, Prince de Chalais and of Benevento. He is the father of the Prince de Sagan, and the husband of the Countess of Hatzfeld, the daughter of Marshal Castellane. He is a proud nobleman, and reminds one of the members of the old French aristocracy, whose education and thorough good manners replaced the wit, erudition, and sometimes the virtues, in which they were deficient, and who, nevertheless, cut a very fine figure in society, owing to their profound knowledge of social rules, and to the care with which they conformed to them. The Duchesse, his wife, is extremely witty, lively, full of imagination and perfect good grace. She is one of those cosmopolitan ladies who have lived in the midst of all civilized societies, and whose charm consists in displaying the rarest and most exquisite characteristics of each of those societies. A daughter, married two years ago to the Prince Egon de Furstemberg, was born of the marriage of the Countess of Hatzfeld with the Due de Valencay. The young Princesse de Furstemberg is a curious and timid lady, small, slenderly built, with reddish hair and pretty features. With her large dreamy eyes she has the grace of the pale-faced Infantas painted by Yelasquez and described by Victor Hugo. Her mind is lively and cheer ful. She seems ill at ease in her womanly dress and with her heavy pearl necklace ; yet, from her indecision, it is easy to notice the dawn of a personality which holds out the prospect of becoming most interesting. After Talleyrand, Decazes, not a very aristocratic name, * The title of a successful and affecting play by George Ohnet. It was performed in London under the title of ' The Ironmaster.'"], [183, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 167 indeed; but it is not my fault, my dear friend, if Louis XVIII. was pleased to raise to ducal rank a person of such plebeian descent. The latter owed his favour to his personal charm. In his old days, the heart of the royal gouty cripple longed for some distraction, not for a deep seated and all-absorbing affection, for the feelings of the aged Sovereign were rather superficial. Just as his tired palate required excitants in order to develop his appetite, his sensitiveness needed the attraction of novelty in order to arouse it. Louis XVIII. loved Madame du Cayla. That envied lady was a regular wonder of feminine charm, one of those rare creatures, full of grace, wit and kindness, who are universally beloved simply for their existence' sake. After Madame du Cayla's death, the King treated the Due Decazes with all the indulgent and blind affection of a fond father. He loaded him with favours, and obstinately turned a deaf ear to the strange rumours that were circu lated concerning the royal favourite at the time of the assassination of the Due de Berry. The Due Decazes was undoubtedly a most eminent man, chiefly remarkable for the insight with which he judged men at a glance, and rated them as they deserved. I can assure you that his son did good service to France ; of this I possess undeniable proof. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, under M. Thiers and under Marshal Mac Mahon, he succeeded, by his noble, firm and intelligent attitude, in saving France from a fresh German invasion. He married Mademoiselle de L\u0153wenthal, the sister of the lovely Marquise de Beauvoir. The Duchesse is not quite so prepossessing as the latter, but her original and expressive features have, nevertheless, much charm. She expresses herself with great nicety and elegance, and displays much intelligence in making the best of the circles in which she lives. But the learned art of frequenting society and enjoying its advantages is so complex that it cannot fail to cause un easiness to ordinary mortals, whose knowledge of it is"], [184, "168 SOCIETY IN PARIS. simply limited to their longing to enjoy it. The Duchesse Decazes seems to have inherited the special talents of her mother. Certain flirts grow ambitious with age ; having subdued hearts, they now aspire to rule over things and to enjoy over society a rather despotic sway, which is not always very pleasant to those who are the objects of such close solicitude. Society people do not easily submit to anybody's whim or fancy. When Medea and Circe grew old, people began to regret the time when those enchan- tresses were busy trying their spell with Jason or Ulysses. The second Empire created five ducal titles : those of Malakoff, Magenta, Tascher la Pagerie, Persigny and Morny. The name of Magenta is associated with the memory of a glorious battle ; that title was conferred in the joyful pride of victory, at a moment when the nephew of the great Napoleon fancied he saw the dawn ofhis Austerlitz and had secured his Marengo. The lucky soldier on whom fell this imperial favour is the great-grandson of a famous military surgeon employed under Louis XY. at the royal school of cavalry, and who purchased a marquisate with the savings from his salary. That surgeon was a very respect able gentleman, undoubtedly descended from an Irishman, possibly from an Irish king, albeit ' without a kingdom,' unless a potato-field may have been considered as such in those days. The records of the family do not state whether he was a member of the ' Land League ' of the time, or whether he had been boycotted for having paid his rent, and thus obliged to take refuge in France ! The great-grandson of that benefactor of suffering man kind had a brilliant military career, and married Mademoi selle de Castries, sister of the late Duke of that name. The Marichale, as that lady is now called in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, is the only bearer of that glorious title in the salons of the ' rive gauche.'* She is of a resolute char- * The left bank of the Seine, where the town residences of most members of the old aristocracy are situated."], [185, "DUCAL FAMILIES __ND THEIR TITLES. 169 acter, and of a conscientious and perhaps too narrow mind. All she saw of politics, under the Empire, was through the career of her husband ; during the Septennate she trusted to the ability of the Due de Broglie and of M. d'Harcourt. On recollecting the serene placidity of that fresh-com- plexioned matron, whose manners seem somewhat stamped with bourgeoisie, it may be safely asserted that she scarcely grasped the importance for her of the events that raised her husband to power. She might have played a very great part ; she little thought of it, or at least that idea did not even cross her mind. A blind admirer of the abilities of the members of her family, she did not think it incumbent on her to mind the destinies of France. I have been told that the absolute discretion she always displayed concerning State secrets proceeded from the care with which she avoided being acquainted with the difficulties and the com- plications inherent to the course of business. She confined herself to the province of charity, and assisted the needy with intelligence, devotion and generosity. It did not cause her much regret to see the Marshal leave power and re-enter private life ; her husband's retreat simply gave her the unpleasant impression that her hero enjoyed a fine com- mand in which he had met with too much opposition to succeed. She failed to grasp the true bearing of the adventure. The integrity with which the financial side of what I was almost about to term the undertaking was conducted, seeing that the Marshal's government was quite an isolated fact in the history of a democratic society, is the only creditable point in the abortive attempt on the part of the former ruling classes to regain their lost influence. When the Marshal left power he was poorer than when he took it. He did not, however, ruin himself, which would have been both useless and imprudent. He gave his assistance generously wherever needed, spent a great deal in official receptions, and, in short,"], [186, "SOCIETY IN PARIS 170 acted as a most worthy and respected representative of France. He has two sons, the eldest of whom, Patrice de MacMahon, is a captain in the chasseurs a pied ;* a very intelligent young man, thoroughly well-bred and lull of practical sense. He will certainly make his mark. The latter's brother, Emmanuel by name, is a gallant lieutenant of Tonkinese riflemen, and seems to have inherited the fighting qualities of his Irish ancestors. Thoughtless, fickle, enterprising, and full of rashness and bravery, he has displayed the most utter and proud scorn for the material side of life ever since he reached the age of manhood, and has most cheerfully squandered his fortune without ever exhibiting the least regret for his folly. He is now entrusted with one of the most dangerous commands in Tonkin, and life, as he himself writes, never seemed to him more delightful than in the midst of those constant perils quite suited to his excitable and enterprising nature. The only daughter of the Marshal is now the wife of the Comte de Piennes, son of a former Chamberlain of Napoleon III. That capital match from every point of view was the happy result of the sympathies won by ' la Mare'chale ' in the society of the Tuileries. An accomplished lady, her conduct at Court was always free from the least affectation, and admirably natural, cheerful and genial. In the Nabab, M. Alphonse Daudet gave us a faithful, though a little overdrawn, portrait of the late Due de Morny. The portion of that fine novel relating to the brilliant courtier and acute statesman may be regarded in the light of an historical document, considering how full of life and reality the picture is, how affecting and poignant the account of the events connected with the death of the omnipotent Duke. On reading the Nabab, I at once recog nised the nobleman I knew : a sceptic full of devotion to his friends, a mind that displayed a curious mixture of * A body of French riflemen."], [187, "DUCAL FAMILIES AND THEIR TITLES. 171 indifference and enthusiasm, an aristocrat without ancestry, and whose outward refined and exquisite manners were admirably suited to conceal either his excessive kindness of heart or his utter and extraordinary absence of principles, as might be the case. That interesting personage was a curious mixture of various characters ; in some respects he reminded one of the Italian noblemen of the admirable sixteenth century, when the struggle for life assumed a cruel and, at the same time, poetic character, and the feline compliance of men's minds made them indifferent as to the means employed to attain their ends ; in other respects, he was a Greek, a modern Alcibiades, for, like the latter, he pos sessed the wonderful art of turning trifles into serious things, and excelled in fascinating the masses by his out ward elegance and care for show, which seemed to raise a golden and dazzling cloud between himself and the vulgarity of the humble crowd. He was a cosmopolitan, and belonged to that class of citizens of the world that ruled society in the early portion of the present century, and who, through constant inter course with their fellow-creatures and with things, extended the horizon of their thoughts to the limits of the civilized world. That nobleman was, besides, a thorough modern, a boulevardier, and a Parisian at heart, to be seen regularly at the Grand Seize,* behind the scenes and in the green rooms of the Opera. He displayed peculiar ability in detecting that vague quivering of the superficial spirit of the age which is termed actualite, and in speculating on it at the fit moment. His mind could embrace the loftiest conceptions, and at the same time grasp the most transient opinion, and shape his policy in accordance with the latter. Morny may be \"\u2022 A room at che ' Caf6 Anglais,' in Paris, specially reserved for the most notable visitors."], [188, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 172 said to have been the very incarnation of the greatness of the imperial idea, and of the spell it exercised over the masses, and his death summed up the causes of the decline of imperial prestige, which was, indeed, buried in Morny's grave. His son has not inherited his great qualities. The pre sent Due de Moray is a witty, cheerful, and amiable young man, full of spirit and 'go,' who does not stand out in bold relief from the rest of his generation. He is the repre sentative of an age monotonous and commonplace, free from the generous impulse of its predecessors \u2014 an age when high life is dull and uninteresting, when politics are limited to the narrow dreams of barristers or of veterinary surgeons, when years follow each other without leaving any other trace than the disappearance of fifty-two weeks. The contrast existing between the late Duke and his successor fully illustrates the change of times. The present Due de Morny is a good-looking young man, very modern in his tastes, and very much liked by all who know him ; but unless I am much mistaken, future historians will have no occasion to deal with a man whose life could simply furnish them with more or less interesting anecdotes. SIXTH LETTER. PRESENT SOCIETY. Lord Palmerston* used to say that, but for its pleasures, life might be bearable. That is the maxim of a splenetic, but there is a certain amount of truth in it. There can be still no doubt that the pursuit of pleasure is irksome ; it is an obligation incumbent on society people, a problem which they must solve. One of the peculiarities of Paris society is the impene trable secrecy in which it wraps itself. A foreigner who * This remark has heen attributed to another statesman, a member of the same Cabinet, Sir George Cornewall Lewis (Translator)."], [189, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 173 has not been brought up from his childhood in that city may come and settle down in it at a riper age, spend ten years in it, and be received everywhere; he will never be made acquainted with the nice shade existing between the various groups composing Parisian society. He will see in every circle of society a uniformity which, in fact, is only appa rent. Madame de Stael used to express herself in terms rather too Rabelaisian to be quoted here respecting the manner in which is acquired the art of treading a carpet. Her saying might also be applied to the art of frequenting and judging Paris society. People must have lived its life, and not merely frequented it, in order to know it thoroughly, and to enjoy all the varieties it con tains. Each family has a spirit of its own, which is handed down from generation to generation ; each circle has its peculiar style, language, manners, and ideas. For many years the salon of the Duchesse Pozzo di Borgo, a Crillon by birth, justly enjoyed the reputation of being one of the leading circles of good society. The Duke, her husband, held his title from the favour of Louis XVIII., who rewarded him with royal generosity for having shown himself the sworn enemy of Napoleon. He was born at Ajaccio, of rather humble parents. His uncle was a small attorney in the chief town of Corsica, and taught him his profession. At an early age Pozzo became secretary to Paoli, whom he assisted in delivering the island into the hands of the English. Lord Elliot, having been appointed Viceroy of Corsica, detected the rare talents of the young Pozzo, and made a diplomatist of him. At that period of constant changes in the map of Europe, diplomacy was one of the best roads to success. Pozzo di Borgo acted in turn as the secret agent of England, Prussia, Austria, and Russia. He detested Napoleon with true Corsiean hatred, and that was a sufficient guarantee to become the factotum of the chief Governments of Europe. After Tilsit his star seemed on the wane ; he was exiled to"], [190, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 174 Constantinople. In 1813 the Czar Alexander recalled him, and sent him as his ambassador to Paris after the restoration of the Bourbons. In 183-5 he was removed to London. His nephew settled in France after his marriage with Mademoiselle de Crillon, whose three sisters married respectively the Due de Caraman, the Comte de Chanaleilles, and the Comte de Levis-Mirepoix. The Duchesse Pozzo di Borgo is a perfect type of the French lady. She is of cheerful and gentle disposition, extremely kind and amiable, and of charming and graceful approach. She was remarkably handsome in her youth, and her features have preserved all their pristine regu larity. Her figure is still that of a young woman, and the distinction of her language and manners imparts an irresis tible charm to her. It is impossible for anyone to display more amenity, and at the same time to be more dignified and natural towards one's guests. She possesses the thorough secret of that kind affableness I heretofore men tioned, and which seems to proceed from a certain loftiness of character, giving peculiar value to the most insignificant words, which thereby acquire a bearing far exceeding their apparent meaning. The impression she makes is not easy to analyze. It proceeds from personal moral worth, and from an unbroken tradition of lofty feelings handed down from generation to generation for a long series of years, and commands respect whilst arousing sympathy. The Duchesse Pozzo di Borgo possesses the average intellectual culture of the day, but has derived wonderful knowledge in the society of the most distinguished men who lived in Europe within the last thirty years, and who all frequented her drawing room. Her mind has acquired rare judgment and suppleness in the society of the eminent intellectual persons she admitted to her intimacy. She thus learned considerably more than she could have done from books, for such intellectual train ing constitutes the highest culture. That was the system adopted by the Greeks, and it produced capital results."], [191, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 175 I wonder why it is not applied nowadays. Scholars, literati, and great politicians need not open schools ; they should merely allow youths to see and frequent them, and to hear their discussions. It would thus be seen that virtue and intellect can be spread and diffused just like vice and bad manners. Let us adopt the porticoes of ancient Athens ; let our great men be no longer the inaccessible grand lamas they are, but visit schools and colleges and converse with their inmates, whose young, unprejudiced, and enthusiastic little souls are admirably fit to receive impressions ; they will thus do far more than heretofore towards promoting the greatness of the country. ' Fortes nascuntur fortibus.' Six years ago, the Duchesse Pozzo di Borgo received every night a select circle of intimate friends, and twice a week her drawing-room was open to all the members of society. Foreigners of distinction were largely represented at her receptions, which were also frequented by the staff of nearly all the diplomatic missions. Every winter the aristocracy of the Faubourg Saint-Germain mustered in force at the balls and concerts of the ducal mansion in the Rue de l'Universite. Since the death of the Duke, the spacious drawing-rooms are closed, and the receptions of his widow have assumed a family and strictly private character. The Duchesse Pozzo being childless, she and her husband adopted one of their nephews, the Comte Jerome Pozzo, who married Mademoiselle de Montesquieu- Fezensac, by whom he has a large family. Last year, his eldest son married Mademoiselle de Boisgelin, and, in compliance with the expressed wish of his great-uncle, he assumed the title of Due on the occasion of his mar riage. The young Duchesse, his wife, is very pretty, of small figure, graceful and lively as a bird. Her lovely youth now cheers up the vast mansion which formerly witnessed so many brilliant fetes and parties. Death also closed the salons of the Duchesse de Doudeau-"], [192, "176 SOCIETY IN PARIS. ville, whose receptions are still present to the memory of most young married ladies, for it had become the rule for girls to make their first visit to society there. A Yerteillac by birth, the Duchesse had, in her youth, been married to the Comte de Bourbon-Conti, who left her a widow at an early age ; she then remained unmarried for many years, until, rather late in life, she became the wife of the Due de Doudeauville, at the death of Mademoiselle de Montmorency, his first wife. The second Duchesse de Doudeauville was a lady of open and cheerful nature ; she always looked at the most pleasant side of life, and preserved until her death the gaiety of youth toned down by the wisdom of old age. There was, doubtless, a certain amount of frivolity in the nature of that excellent lady ; she never could realize the fact that she was getting old, or rather did not believe in old age, any more than in grief or malignity. She would have smiled at Hamlet's soliloquy. It may be said that her life was but a long dream, the spell of which death alone broke. She treated all the accidents of life with the same kindly philosophj7, and obstinately shutting her eyes to whatever might have grieved her, everything appeared beautiful and pleasant to her. She never went anywhere, but expressed her delight at the ball or dinner, although all the rest of the company may have been quite disappointed. In her eyes those for whom she had any affection were possessed of Venus' or Apollo's features, besides the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost She never ceased to praise the virtues and merits of her first husband, and at the same time confessed that her second husband was the only man that could have consoled her for so grievous a loss \u2014 adding also that in this he had fully succeeded. She never missed the opportunity of rendering services or helping people in trouble ; she was most amiable in her expressions, and a malignant word never passed her lips\u2014 in fact, she treated all her contemporaries as though they were models of grace"], [193, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 177 and virtue. She lived to a very old age, without disease or infirmity, and quietly passed away, and received with a kindly smile the priest who assisted her, merely remarking, with unfeigned surprise, ' Is it possible ?' when informed that death was at hand. The following lines of Musset might fitly be applied to her : ' Me preserve le ciel d'en savoir davantage, Le masque est si joli que j'ai peur du visage, Et, meme en carnaval, je n'y toucherai point. '* The Duchesse de Doudeauville was very fond of society, and so arranged her life as to enjoy as much as possible the company of her friends. Every Sunday, from January 1st to June loth every year, she gave a great dinner to above a dozen guests, composed of her nephews and nieces and of her sons-in-law and children. Those dinners were followed by grand receptions, the honours of which were done by the Princesse de Leon, the Comtesse de Durfort and the Princesse de la Tour d'Auvergne. It may be said that the good Duchess still lives in those heirs of her fortune and virtues. I have already spoken of the Princesse de Le\"on. As for the Comtesse de Durfort, she preserves, in spite of her age, all the freshness and vividness of her mind, coupled with that deep sympathy for young people which, it appears, lightens the weight of years, and is the reason why those who cultivate that amiable disposition always feel young. She is most kind and indulgent towards her fellow-creatures, and always selects items of conversation that will enable her visitors to display their wit and the brighter qualities of their minds. Her judgments are free from severity, and point to a decided tendency on her part to veil and palliate whatever in people's conduct might be open to criticism. Such adepts of the fashionable rules of the eighteenth * ' May heaven preserve me from learning any more ! The mask is so pretty that I am afraid to see the face, And, even in carnival-time, I should refrain from lifting it.' 12"], [194, "SOCIETY IH PARIS. 178 century are still to be met in French society, who in per fect good faith regard as a much greater crime to fail in the discharge of a social duty than in that of a moral obligation, and who will countenance all phantasies and excuse all sins, provided those faults do not infringe the laws of good-breeding. That was the ruling theory of the last century, whose morality was doubtless pleasant, and brought up our grandmothers to play the charming part of benefactresses and ornaments of poor mankind, concealing debauchery under flowery wreaths, indulging gaily in easy love, and practising to perfection the art of gallantry until the dark hours when the social storm suddenly broke forth and brutally cut short those frivolous and licentious ways. There are still people who believe in that theory which, when applied by a discreet and well-balanced mind, is not devoid of charm. The Princesse de la Tour d'Auvergne is the niece of the Comtesse de Durfort ; her husband is a perfect gentleman, whose chief ambition consists in proving his relationship with Godefroy de Bouillon, the gallant conqueror of the Saracens and defender of the Holy Sepulchre. I have no intention to quarrel with him about a claim which, if experts are to be relied on, is rather bold. Besides, such claims are perfectly harmless ; they constitute an innocent mania, and cause infinite pleasure to those who succeed in inducing their contemporaries to acknowledge them. The Princesse de la Tour d'Auvergne is kind, meek, amiable and full of prepossessing grace. Her husband has inherited the immense fortune of his uncle, the illustrious prelate of Bourges, who, though an ecclesiastic, displayed remarkable wealth in his robes and jewels. The niece of that late Prince of the Church charmingly turns to mundane use his costly lace and precious stones, and when the eyes fall on the matchless emerald of which she has now made a brooch, it reminds one of the devout kisses formerly im pressed by the faithful on the superb stone."], [195, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 179 But, my friend, I am wandering from my subject, and forget the aim I had in view, which was to acquaint you with the grave and discreet salons of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, whose manners are rather cold and rigid, ** O ' and whose company is strictly select. Next to the circles I have just mentioned, I must notice the drawing-rooms of the Comtesse de Levis-Mirepoix, of the Duchesse de Galliera, of the Duchesse de Noailles, and of the Marquise de Lillers. The Levis family is of ancient and illustrious origin. The claims of its members as regards descent have often been laughed at, but without admitting the truth of all the anecdotes which tend to prove that they consider them selves as the direct descendants of Levi, one of Jacob's sons, being as such related to the Holy Virgin, I see no reason to doubt the antiquity of their noble race. However, that noble origin did not deter one of their ancestors from following the advice of the amiable Marquise de Sevigne as to the advantage of regilding one's coat-of-arms by means of wealthy mesalliances. Samuel Bernard, the famous financier, gave him his youngest daughter, the two eldest having married the Marshal Due de Broglie and the Due de Choiseul. Those little bourgeoises were, however, charming persons, and on becoming ladies of title they played their part so naturally, and displayed so much grace and feminine adaptability in the discharge of their new duties, that they fully deserve to be ranked amongst the lovely grand mothers of the eighteenth century. The Duchesse de Choiseul having encouraged in Louis, a young musician, ten years old, the strong feeling that rules the world, the poor boy became madly enamoured with that lady, who, as apology for the harm she had done, simply said : ' You may love whomever you please ; there is no harm in it,' a remark which sums up the whole philosophy of her time. 12\u20142"], [196, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 180 The present Comtesse de LeVis-Mirepoix, a Crillon by birth, is a fit descendant of such ancestors. She has been a handsome woman, and is still full of dignified grace with her white hair. Before the death of her husband, her drawing-rooms were open to society once a week in Lent, and the oval salon of the Rue de Lille was, with that of the Duchesse d'Avaray, one of social circles the least invaded by the spirit of the day. M. de Levis-Mirepoix is first or second cousin to the Larochefoucauld - Doudeauvilles, Talleyrand - Perigords, Gontaut-Birons, Biencours and Brissacs, by his mother, who was a Montmorency. The company to be met in the salons of Madame de Levis-Mirepoix was chiefly composed of those numerous relatives, and visitors there seemed to obey a word of command when addressing elderly persons as uncle or aunt, and treating their contemporaries as cousins. Family spirit reigns supremely in the social relations of the noble faubourg ; it assumes the proportions of a regular code of duties, rather irksome to perform, owing to the numerous ties uniting the various families. In his fine novel, ' Une Vie,' M. de Maupassant hits with great ability that peculiar feature in the manners of the old French society. Monsieur and Madame de Briseville are, in details \u2014 although they may appear rather fossilized on the whole \u2014 perfect types of that provincial aristocracy whose spirit still exists amongst the inmates of the mansions of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. M. de Briseville spends his life in genealogical researches, and in keeping up his family relations by means of a vast and laborious correspondence. He does so with the intimate conviction of thus performing a social duty of the highest importance ; he respects in his own person the memory of all his ancestors, and cultivates his relations as scrupulously as one should follow the tenets of one's creed. In so doing he acts in perfect keeping with the spirit of the old faubourg. That spirit is one of the chief factors which contribute to"], [197, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 181 maintain in its integrity the traditions of a class which has lost much of its social and political importance since the advent of democracy, as also the prestige of wealth since the abolition of the right of primogeniture and of Uat formerly possessed by its members of disposing by will as they wished of their property. That spirit is as strong now as it ever was. It manifests itself in the various occasions arising from births, marriages, illnesses and deaths, and especially in that feeling owing to which the respectability of a family is supposed to condone for the faults and moral weaknesses of one of its members. This is, no doubt, a praiseworthy practice, to which is due many a case of moral restoration. Wherever the honour of a family is at stake, all its members interfere spontaneously to save it ; whenever a name is open to attack, all who bear it acknowledge their joint liability and step forth to protect it. That communion of feelings is a powerful help in danger or distress. When a member of a family is passing through some trying circumstances, all his relatives step forth to defend and protect him, whether his trouble be deserved or not ; and if it is required that the accused should disappear permanently or for a time, in order to escape from the danger threatening him, all obstacles are overcome to secure that aim. Family solicitude assumes every form, and strives ingeniously all it can to show its devotion. The French aristocracy considers that natural obligation as strictly binding to an extent quite unknown by other classes. It is a noble and praiseworthy action to pick up one's dead and tend one's wounded in the battle of life, the more so that few people now do it in our days, when the growing demand for luxury and the love of pleasure seem to develop a general current of selfishness. The social circles of the Faubourg Saint-Germain have not escaped the contagion. There, as everywhere else, the evil has spread its roots, but family spirit and due regard for the honour of great names associated with the glories of"], [198, "182 SOCIETY IN PARIS. old France still resist the general impulse and successfully check its progress. That obscure devotion proceeds from a deep-seated conception of generosity, and its merit is all the greater that it is efficacious only as far as its action remains unknown. That conception and its influence on the French nobility constitute one of its greatest titles to respect. That virtue \u2014 for that it is to all intents and purposes \u2014 is, of course, more or less developed ; some families possess it to the greatest extent, and it contributes admirably to keep up their rank and further their prosperity. Its practice is one of the characteristics of all the families allied to the Montmorency. I have had occasion to notice as a fact that that great name seems possessed of marvellous power for developing strong family ties. That illustrious blood seems to have the privilege of stimulating that natural fibre \u2014 affection towards our relations \u2014 and to impart to it peculiar sensitiveness. Alliance with the Montmorencys constitutes a close and faithful tie, a constant claim for mutual help and assistance, a union of peculiar strength and power. The salons of the Hotel de Crillon, now in the possession of the Duchesse de Polignac, cannot be surpassed in magni ficence, and are certainly eminently suitable for entertaining society. That superb residence is situated in the Place Louis XV.,* and occupies one of the pavilions of the stately building of which the Ministry of Marine is the fellow ; the other pavilion is occupied by the former Hotel de Coislin, now tenanted by the club of the Royale. A spacious square room \u2014 the grand drawing-room \u2014 overlooks the open square ; its decoration belongs to the purest Louis XVI. style, and is truly imposing, admirably harmonious as a whole, and marvellously finished in details. Eagles act as supporters to the arched ceiling, all the orna ments of which are scrupulously reproduced on the carpet covering the floor, which is a fine specimen of the tapestry- * Now Place de la Concorde."], [199, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 183 work executed last century at La Savonnerie ;* as for the curtains of the windows, the sofas and easy-chairs, all arranged classically along the walls, their tapestry belongs to the best style of Aubusson manufacture. A superb portrait of the Duchesse de Polignac, the devoted friend of Queen Marie-Antoinette, by Madame Vigee-Lebrun,-f occupies a panel, the fellow to which contains an allegory representing a Marquise de Crillon as Hebe, a gallant pro duction of Mignard.j The Duchesse de Polignac is a lady of much distinction ; she is small and delicate in frame, and her features are exquisitely regular and lovely. Her salon is frequented by about the same people as are to be met at the Hotel de Mirepoix. Visitors to the Hotel de Crillon are indulgent and forbearing, if not naturally so, at least in order to make themselves agreeable to the noble mistress of the place, whose horror for slander is proverbial. Children and young people are welcome in that house. The Duchesse is the mother of four children, who have made her the happy grandmother of ten lovely babies, the eldest of which is hardly ten years old. In short, the home of the Duchesse de Polignac is a perfect model of happiness and simplicity. The inmates of the Hotel de Noailles are of more reserved dispositions. The Due, whose portrait I have already drawn, discharges his social duties with the tact of a man of the world, although his manners are rather more haughty than necessary. As for the Duchesse, she plays her part most conscientiously, which causes her to affect being much more amiable than her nature permits. Thus, it is easy to detect that her polite ways are cold and devoid of spontaneousness, and are the result of great personal exertions to please her visitors ; it consists * The name of a manufactory of art-tapestry founded in Paris under the reign of Henri IV. ; it was done away with in 1728. f A famous French portrait-painter who died in 1842. % The favourite portrait-painter of Louis XIV.

Her visitors have the vague impression of having entered some classical shrine of good manners and social virtues, and feel that they are personally called upon to keep up, by their presence, conversation and general behaviour, tbe tradition of good company. In spite of themselves, they feel rather crushed beneath the importance of the part they are expected to play, and do all in their power to come off creditably, in which they generally succeed ; the best plan for that being to follow the example of one's companions .... of pleasure. The secret of success in that society consists in con versing in a subdued tone of voice, in avoiding unusual topics, in preferring to talk about the weather, or some projected wedding, in praising the virtues of some eminent dead person, in skilfully reaching the door and disappear ing discreetly and quickly. As for myself, on leaving that circle, I felt highly flattered, honoured and gratified, besides convinced of having, for a moment, contributed my share towards keeping up some grand institution. The salon of the Marquise de Lillers is the very opposite of that of the Due de Noailles. That aged and amiable lady-dowager is a widow of much sense and exquisite kindness ; she is very fond of society, and most gracious towards her visitors. Society returns the compliment, for few ladies can boast of gathering as large a circle of friends as that charming grandmother. Her conversation is most pleasant and suited to all tastes, and one does not know what to admire most of either the open and cheerful humour unaltered by age or infirmities, or the rare and profound erudition, and the serious and deep thought expressed in such refined and thoroughly attractive language. The Marquise de Lillers knows a great deal, and is quite"], [201, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 185 free from pedantry, which shows a superior mind. There is a certain danger in the importance which it is the present fashion to give to the erudition of women. It may be feared that, in order not to remain in that respect in a state of inferiority as compared with th e middle classes \u2014 which is doubtless a praiseworthy object \u2014 the upper classes should make the mistake of neglecting education for in struction, whereas the former is, in my humble opinion, of far more importance than the latter. Ladies of quality inherit from their parents refined manners and lofty moral feelings ; but in order not to degenerate into defects, those happy gifts need being cultivated and trained with infinite art. For instance, in their desire to please they are, when but children, already consummate flirts. It is, therefore, necessary to teach them that simplicity and self-abnegation \u2014 whenever circumstances require it \u2014 should be co-ex istent with their natural desire to please, which would otherwise be but a silly and irksome form of vanity. Their material and moral ideas are naturally loft}7 ; their thoughts are inclined to the abstract. It is important not to allow them to indulge in idle fancy ; they may have an ideal, but must not dream all their life \u2014 reality is sometimes good to face. It may be objected that they will never feel so com fortable in this inn, which the world is, than in the fairy palaces of their imagination. That I confess, but we must guard them against disappointment. Now and then some privileged creature may indulge her pretty dream during all her life, but for the majority the dream vanishes suddenly and stern reality has to be faced ; thus many women on facing reality would prefer having been sooner acquainted with its austere features. The girls of the upper classes are naturally shrewd ; their supple and quick minds are remarkably fitted for the skilful practice of feminine diplomacy. That happy dis position should, however, be overruled by an upright and loyal spirit. . . . You will thus observe, my young friend,"], [202, "186 SOCIETY IN PARIS. that though I acknowledge the importance of the special tuition which it is now the prevailing custom to introduce in the education of the young ladies of the upper classes, I am nevertheless of opinion that the most useful and indis pensable teachings are those which they gather all day long by the side of a lounge-chair, in some familiar corner, from those kind and affectionate conversations by means of which the minds of children derive all the experience acquired by a person whose life is already long and has been well filled. A mother is the only person who can successfully acquaint her daughter with all the delicate and nice shades of sentiment and propriety. Thus, by a constant exchange of thoughts and appreci ations, is handed down, from generation to generation, the secret of the marvellous refinement of heart, mind and manners which constitutes the characteristic of the French lady of birth. Proud, simple, witty and kind, kissing a poor child as readily as she would receive the homage of a king, always at home, as noble and dignified in poverty as in opulence, practising virtue in a grand and noble manner, and imprinting her lofty feelings even on her defects and weaknesses \u2014 such is, in a few words, the portrait of the French lady of the upper classes. If I still live to see several generations of ladies, I should be deeply grieved to be deprived of the exquisite satisfaction which delicate and refined people now experience in the company of ladies, if their excellent traditions should vanish under the baneful influence of the clumsy modern spirit. Pedantry, with the vanity, mean rivalries and ridiculous pretensions attendant on it, will spoil irremediably the ladies of the upper classes. What need have ladies to bother themselves with the stores of humbugs called human science? Facts, dates, and preconceived judgments, will they ever have an oppor tunity of conversing usefully on such subjects ? Will ever anyone ask them in what year Semiramis reigned over"], [203, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 187 Chaldea, the number of stars comprising a constellation, or the result of the recent excavations in Egypt ? It is far more interesting to talk with a lady about life and the things of the world, to penetrate with a guide as sweetly affable as she is reserved and discreet into the secret mys teries of sentiment, and to fathom the intricacies of the human heart. Women do not reason much ; they examine, understand, and fully grasp only that which they guess. It is right that women should have compared their own way of looking at things, and appreciating them with that of the masters of human intellect. I, therefore, do not wish women to live in utter ignorance of the current of contem porary thought ; but I am afraid that their natural shrewd ness will get blunted, and their discernment misled in acquainting themselves with endless works and researches, and that they will lose all charm and originality in their endeavour to share the ideas and beliefs of those who are regarded as the leaders of thought. Every intelligent and witty woman is so in a thoroughly personal and spontaneous manner. If a woman does not remain herself, if her intellectual development is subjected to foreign influence, there are reasons to believe that such interference will be detrimental. George Sand, that good and charitable fairy, who bore cheerfulby that necessary evil we call life, whose philosophy was sound and comfort ing, and whose noble character was only counterbalanced by her immoderate thirst for affection, allowed herself to give way to the untoward influence of the social and poli tical theories of her master ! How far more in her line she is when writing her lovely tales to the weary Sultan which this poor nineteenth century of ours has been ! Women should be influenced neither by an excess of erudition nor by selfish pedagogues. She must remain herself; and we should confine ourselves to open to her the fountains of thought and observation by enabling her to gratify her curiosity and to become acquainted with all"], [204, "188 SOCIETY IN PARIS. the intellectual manifestations of her time. She should know several foreign languages, and be sufficiently con versant with the technicalities of music and of the arts of drawing to be able to judge and compare, develop her taste, and experience pleasant sensations. She will, perhaps, some day cultivate some special branch of art, so as to fully occupy her time. It is, therefore, right that her first educa tion should have provided her with the elements indispen sable to guide her choice ; but that alone is required. It is quite superfluous that a young lady of eighteen should be capable of being a virtuoso, an artist, or a teacher before going into society. She must simply have learned the way to study, and have received a general moral, intellectual and artistic culture. When married, and possessed of relative freedom of action, she will then, if she pleases, pursue her intellectual development in the direction that will best suit her interest, that of her husband, and the comfort of her home. Before, above all other things, she should be acquainted with life, the practice of home virtues, and social proprieties. If, besides that, she be conscientious in her duty ; if she be firm and resolute for good, of meek resolution, chaste and indulgent, I will say, happy the Pygmalion whose kiss will awake the heart of so lovely a being. For, indeed, a woman is complete only inasmuch as she has loved. A woman must sooner or later love somebody or other; and the work of civilization may be useless; it may miss its aim or become dangerous, if eternal nature has not enforced its claims \u2014 if Eve's daughter did not, for hours, for days, forget the routine of everyday life in an ideal; nay, in a real love ! When passion has taught her its glorious and painful secret, when her heart has lived, when her intimate person has startled under the magic incantation, then only is a woman accomplished. Love is as indispensable to the moral and physical beauty of woman as blood is to life ; and the general opinion of"], [205, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 189 the world is much mistaken with regard to that point. Most people, in order to explain why some feminine natures are so ill-balanced, and some minds so uncertain as to their aim, prefer to affect to lay down as principles that the education of women of the upper classes tends to make them conceited and to develop in them an inordinate love of flirtation and intrigue ; that the practices in use in elegant society further pervert their minds and harden their hearts ; and that those who cultivate the art of social life must needs learn to have no higher aim but puerile vanity, and lose sight of the broad lines of life. That is a great mistake ; social education is a good thing. It embraces a high moral and intellectual culture and a sufficiency of the ideal, owing to its fostering religious feelings and family affections. Thus a lady, on reaching the maturity of her youth, is a delicately finished and ex quisitely chiselled tool, quite ready to play a brilliant part in life ; and if love animates her soul, the latter will bud forth with all the marvellous expansion of feminine charm. If, on the contrary, she should be doomed to lead a single life, her moral being will be subjected to an almost inevit able deviation, which will manifest itself either by the exaggeration of some natural defect or by a perturbation of her faculties. Such deviation assumes various forms. It is, however, easy to detect its influence in several characteristics, which lead people to denounce social education. Certain women will thus become shockingly frivolous and selfish, and, wasting their heart and life over vain trifles, obstinately pursue the stupid ideal of being, for instance, the best dressed woman in Paris. They will dream of a pretty bonnet, as Galileo of the mechanics of the heavenly bodies. Others will display their ambition in the limited sphere of social relations. They will apply themselves to increase their own importance, to extend the circle of their acquaint ances, and improve it by hunting after introductions to"], [206, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 190 people of greater eminence. Their great object will be to receive at least half a hundred visitors when ' at home,' to give dinners which will be talked about, and balls and parties where everybody would wish to be invited. They know the pedigree and the personal appearance of fifteen hundred persons, and are conversant with the degree of relationship and the personal fortune of everybody. They are thoroughly acquainted with all quarrels and dis agreements, and know exactly how intimate people are with each other ; few scandals are unknown to them ; their conversation is a living gazette, and their brain is filled with empty news, which they divulge with great fuss. With other women, better gifted, the deviation has taken place to the advantage of their intellect. One of them, for instance, of a melancholy nature, reconciles herself to her fate. She studies, compares, and reflects; she will even tually accustom herself so to analyze moral facts that everything connected with sentiment will fail to bring any comfort to her heart. The curiosity of her mind has dried up the fountain-head of affection. Her mind is in fact a torch that burns what it should illumine, and lays waste all that it meets with. She is like the child who, not satisfied with pulling the strings of its plaything, takes it to pieces in order to see how it works, or like the sick person who, getting his mattress carded every day, only succeeds in having a hard bed. There are many more kinds of eccentricities, which would take me too long to mention ; at any rate, nearly all of them proceed from the same cause, the deprivation of love. Seeing that respectable women are by far the majority, and that few marriages in society are love marriages, such instances are most frequent, and it is but natural that they should have been ascribed to defective social educa tion. Of course, my young friend, you will ask what remedy"], [207, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 191 can be applied to the evil ? Unfortunately there is none. Social rules are made for collective bodies ; they pitilessly sacrifice individual interests to the advantage of the com munity. Struggle is useless ; for everything is to be lost by not submitting to the traditions, and even to the prejudices, of one's own class. Wise and clever persons cheerfully accept the clauses of the compact that binds them, take credit for submitting to them and adroit advan tage of the amount of freedom that is left to them. Prudent and virtuous parents will teach their daughters that they must only love whom duty commands. They will marry them with their equals in rank, fortune, or situation, the superiority of one of those advantages making up for inferiority in the others. They will devoutly hope that love will come either with the betrothal or with marriage itself; and should their expectations be deceived, and the whimsical god prove relentless, they will not hold them selves responsible for any harm that may follow. I may here remark that society indemnifies those who sacrifice their hearts to the privilege of entering its circle. Social duties are sufficient to fill one's life ; and certain eminent positions constitute a heavy burden for the weak shoulders of a woman. Ladies are so used to the fatigue resulting from the discharge of such duties, that they bear it cheerfully, and do not seem to feel it. It is wonderful to see those delicate frames enduring the infliction of numerous visits, passing sleepless nights, and engaging in tiresome occu pations that would tax all the energy of a robust bour geoise. For instance, much moral and physical exertion is needed to bring together the visitors who form what is called a salon. One of the roads to success consists in speculating on the force of habit. Man is of all animals that which is the greatest slave of custom. He will readily go to-day where he went yesterday, and experiences a certain"], [208, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 192 pleasure in daily ascending the same staircase and crossing at a given time the same waiting-room. The mistress of a house must therefore be free from headache, and not indulge in fancy or distractions of any kind. On certain days, at certain hours, always the same, she must be ready, and not fail to do this year what she did in previous years, taking care to introduce but in significant modifications in the way she is to move, group, and entertain her guests. The Duchesse de Maille' excels in that great art. For the last thirty years her drawing rooms are thrown open every Sunday to her numerous visitors. Hasty, lively, kind, and intelligent, she is the very embodiment of energy, activity, and gaiety. She has a very great air of dignity with her powdered hair, her fine features, her average size, and well-made figure, now getting a little too heavy, owing to her having recently shown a tendency to corpulence. She is very fond of society, and enjoys over it a kind of authority, which enables her to tell hard truths to everybody without its being possible for her visitors to resent such severe treatment, administered as it is with a kind and witty bluntness, the fits of which are sometimes highly entertaining. The Duchesse de Maille' places her personal influence and winning powers at the service of the defence of the classical traditions of good company. She takes up boldly and rates soundly certain daring ways which lately crept into society, and certain knacks which some people now assume of shaking off the polite rules of the old French society. She does not spare anybody, and there can be no doubt that she has largely contributed to organize the resistance of certain circles to the rising tide of the spirit of the day. The arguments and lectures of the amiable Duchesse are quite free from that sullen spirit which applies itself to denounce the present times by extolling purposely the ways and manners of the past. She is quite sincere in her convictions. Her mind is too enlightened, her judg-"], [209, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 193 ment too shrewd, and her intellect too well balanced to indulge the morose misanthropy of people who sincerely believe they regret the ways and manners of their youth, whereas they only mourn over times they will never see again. The world is full of such disagreeable persons. The Duchesse de Maille' is too amiable to have anything to regret. Both young and old people like her as much as they respect her, and she herself is as anxious to-day to enjoy the society of her contemporaries as she was twenty years ago. She receives her visitors with great tact, without exaggerated politeness, and seems simply bent upon enjoying herself. She leads, however, a serious and well-filled life. She superintends the education of her numerous grandchildren, is president of the council of several charitable institutions, and her friends always find her willing to help and assist them. When out visiting in Paris she invariably rides in a large and old-fashioned landau drawn by a superb team of horses. Some irreverent people call it la guimbarde, but in the eyes of the members of the aristocracy of the Faubourg Saint-Germain that antiquated vehicle is the symbol of the attachment of its owner to the manners and ideas that prevailed in her youth, and they see it pass without a smile. The salon of the Comtesse Aimery de la Rochefoucauld is, like that of the Duchesse de Maille, a centre of attraction dear to youth. The composition of all the salons I have mentioned is very nearly the same ; the two last alone are a little more accessible. What I might term the foreign and transient portion of French society is more largely repre sented there. The same remark applies to the salon of the Comtesse de la Ferronnays, whose hotel in the Cours-la- Reine is frequented by a considerable number of distin guished foreigners and of the native lions of the day. There the lists of guests are arranged in a rather liberal spirit. l:l"], [210, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 194 Having thus reviewed these various circles, regular strongholds of the aristocratic spirit, I will now endeavour to give you a general idea of the character of their salons. An acute observer will at once be struck by that monotonous and trite character, which is also that of those of which I intend speaking hereinafter. No salon has any special feature ; the air one breathes in any of them is always the same, the conversations one hears are identical, the politeness with which one is treated is as meaningless in one as it is in the other. It seems that the code of society enforces the scrupulous observance of certain narrow rules, strictly excluding the charm of originality and of anything unforeseen. Every visitor seems sedulously bent on resembling everybody else, so as to avoid being singular. Everybody endeavours to copy his neighbour, and, with the exception of a few ladies anxious to show off their jewels and dresses, and of a few gentlemen who pretend to be earnestly engaged in courting them, the general expression on all faces is one of worry and lassitude. Society people are, as a rule, cold, reserved, and imper turbable. It seems hard to believe they have souls, think ing brains, feeling hearts, and any will. Education having cast them in the same mould, they seem to have lost all individuality, and it needs much goodwill and reflection to believe that God did not modify in their favour the eternal law of endless variety in creation. Life in society has the privilege \u2014 or, as some may think, the disadvantage \u2014 of greatly toning down the impulse of passions and the warmth of feelings, and these charac teristics have been carefully studied and depicted with great reality in recent psychological novels dealing with the character and manners of the upper classes. With people belonging to the latter, the various impulses of the heart \u2014 love, hatred, jealousy, or ambition \u2014 are tame in expression, and their manifestation lacks spontaneousness"], [211, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 195 and energy. Members of society never love passionately ; their hatred is mild and their will is weak. When we now read some of the works written in olden times, and dealing with sentiment or passion, we fail to grasp the true meaning of those grand outbursts of the human heart, and they find no echo in our souls. The artificial side of mundane life seems to preclude all passionate manifestations. The drawing-rooms of society are regular theatres, where each visitor plays his part as best he can. The great art and the secret of success seem to consist in having sufficient judgment to hold one's tongue whenever required, and concealing one's nature under the mask of good breeding. One gains in public estimation in proportion as one dissembles and masters one's feelings, and that remark is chiefly true of society. Love whom you please, but do not let anyone know it. When greeting your lady-love, let your smile seem cold and indifferent, touch her hand as you would that of any body else, affect the greatest unconcern on seeing her walk off on a stranger's arm, and, whatever happens, carefully conceal whatever grief or joy you may feel. . . . Testify your friendship in a prudent and discreet fashion, but do not make a show of it. Love in society is subjected to the various considerations of rank, fortune, vanity, and to what is known as propriety. Venus would certainly disown such feeling, so unlike the love of guileless hearts. . . . It is only natural that you should hate your enemy, but in doing so you must avoid noise or scandal. In dealing with him, resort to skilful perfidy and discreet torture, and slowly destroy his reputation or happiness. You will have reached your aim if you only succeed in sinking him into ridicule, than which no worse fate could happen to any member of society. Everything in our days is the result of convention, and, by a curious contrast, whilst the masses are more feverishly than ever carried away by the rapid stream of passion, the upper 13\u20142"], [212, "196 SOCIETY IN PARIS. classes themselves are more than ever subjected to the narrow laws of prejudices and preconceived ideas. The reason of this is that the intellectual movement is now democratized. By extending to the middle and lower classes, it derived fresh energy from those young and powerful elements whose intellectual manifestations now surpass those of what is known as the ruling classes. The upper classes are gradually growing less numerous, and daily declining in importance. On seeing in the letters and records of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries what kind of men were the ancestors of the present aristocracy, one experiences the feeling of the ploughman described by Virgil, who, on discovering the bones of the ancient warriors who fell in epic fights, contemplated with wonder the re mains of those marvellous men. Having lost its former grandeur, the French aristocracy became in turn interesting, charming, and puerile ; it is now simply insignificant. It is very rare to meet in society any person possessed of real originality. As a rule, when a member of the upper classes devotes himself to science or literature, he makes it a point to dwell simply on the trifles dear to society, for fear of arousing spite, jealousy, or indifference. On entering a drawing-room he leaves his intellectual accomplishments behind him \u2014 a proof of good taste much appreciated by the upper classes. Thus in social relations all intellectual character dis appears, and society would be the most stupid and most meaningless of things if, from time to time, we did not meet there these two charming personages : the accom plished lady of the world, a skilful and refined siren, in whom virtue is coupled with grace, or weakness of heart with dignity ; and the perfect man of the world \u2014 a curious mixture of Valmont,* Alcibiades, and C\u00e6sar \u2014 a modern and high-born Don Juan. * Valmont de Bomare (Jacques-Christophe), a learned French naturalist and explorer, born in 1731 in Rouen, died in 1807 in Paris."], [213, "PRESENT SOCIETY. 197 Contemporary literature possesses a grand conception of the latter. It is in almost every respect that so powerfully delineated by M. Octave Feuillet in ' M. de Camors ' : To subject everything to the spirit of criticism, to shake off all religious and sentimental laws, to acknowledge honour as the sole rule of human actions, to regard the joys of love and the satisfaction of realized ambition as the supreme happiness and chief object of life \u2014 such is the moral code of the fickle husband of Mademoiselle de Thecle, who should rather be styled the lover of Madame de Campvallon. Fine as it is, the character of M. de Camors is deficient in some respects. In the first instance, he acknowledges his wrongs too readily \u2014 a failing which doubtless arouses the curiosity of readers, and adds to the interest of the work. When painting his own portrait, Delacroix sketched his famous green waistcoat with more truth and reality than could have been shown by one of his pupils ; there is likewise more charm and power in that picture of M. de Camors disclosing cynically the innermost recesses of his heart, and making, as it were, a kind of show of his moral ugliness. The picture would nevertheless have been truer had the writer represented his character as less conscious of his weaknesses \u2014 at least, in appearance. There is, I know, something vague and transient in the moral side of a man's life. Yet such a type exists ; and if we examine the superiority that is apparent beneath the surface of the mundane varnish which at first sight may lead us to suppose a man to have a strong will and to act as he pleases, there are many reasons for thinking that he has thrown over- board, as useless ballast, the beliefs of his youth, his family traditions, and the prejudices of caste, in order to act only in accordance with some vague conception of honour \u2014 an abstract idea which, in his case, consist sin his admiration of the noble and proud work God has achieved in making him. I do not intend here to appreciate the worth of the moral"], [214, "198 SOCIETY IN PARIS. theories of M. Octave Feuillet. He tells us that had M. de Camors shared the faith of Saint Francis of Assisi, or the philosophical views of M. Cousin,* he would not have wasted his life, and been killed by grief for having done so. But my experience points to the very reverse happen ing in real life. The Camors of society seduce Madame Lescande, and easily console themselves for her death. They effect a reconciliation with Madame de Camors, whom they were sensible enough to select from among that class of ladies who have sufficient tact not to fear being aban doned, and chiefly not to let any such apprehension appear. For such men, the danger does not consist in the trouble likely to arise from those vulgar incidents ; it proceeds from the risk which superior minds run of detecting the puerility and nothingness of the manifestations of human activity in social circles. Carried along by the force of habit and of example, as also by the animal impulse which urges youth to apply its strength and energy to some particular object, they may enter upon a career, undertake researches, bury themselves in study or hunt up adventures, and live shut up in their conventional ideas, but on reaching the age of thirty, they will suddenly wake up to find that there is nothing but deception and delusion in practical life, that the eternal problems cannot be solved, and that Buddha was right, but that in order to follow his example it is necessary to have the large heart of the god, to be, in fact, full of tender compassion towards human miseries. The one lives like a machine, indifferent to joy or interest, letting the days slip by, and one's hair grow white.

Do not, dear friend, look for anything else in society. There, both men and women have their own aims in view, It furnishes them with the opportunity of displaying them selves and trying to eclipse one another. With women, the object of life is to be admired for the elegance of their dress, the costliness of their jewels, or the charm of their conversation. For men, it consists in being the heroes of many intrigues. Women long to be respected Ninons, men unmasked Don Juans. Such is the ideal of each sex ; there is no other, and it is idle to seek for anything else, all attempts in that direction being doomed to inevitable disappointment. SEVENTH LETTER. SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. In the foregoing letter, I have introduced you, my young friend, to several social circles, the members of which have a serious turn of mind and _. profound respect for tradition. There is no essential difference between those salons and others whose mistresses, being younger, seem to have adopted ways and ideas more modern. The same visitors are to be met in both, the etiquette is exactly the same, and, but for a little more indulgence towards smokers of cigarettes and bezique players, the latter are in every respect reproductions of the former. In younger salons, there may perhaps be noticed a little more anxiety to bring together persons already bound by the ties of sympathy \u2014 by one of those lucky coincidences which chance may easily explain, a young lady will gene rally, at grand dinners, be seated at table by the side of a young gentleman who is the faithful guest of her five o'clock teas. That praiseworthy and kind attention"], [216, "200 SOCIETY IN PARIS. often, however, misses its mark and gives rise to a certain embarrassment and coldness in conversation. The amiable hostess who procured what she thought a pleasant surprise may, without being much mistaken, take an already long acquaintance for a recent one. It then happens \u2014 and that case is frequent \u2014 that the two friends have soon exchanged their confidences and have nothing more to say. Is such complaisance on the part of the mistress of a house \u2014 plainly intended as it is to procure clandestine felicity \u2014 to be blamed or approved ? Alas ! average hearts are quite satisfied with it. But would Alceste,* for instance, have thanked Arsinte with all the pride of his bitter whim, if, instead of trying to poach on Celimene's ground, she had played his game by inviting together to a nice supper the lovely flirt and the man with the green ribands ? By help- ing love, one humbles and desecrates it ; that divine senti ment cannot be likened to ordinary feelings, and, with people whose life is made up with fiction and conventions, nothing is more dangerous than that vulgarity of feeling which, being incapable of judging and understanding, brutally interferes in the delicate sphere of sentiment, without any fear of the consequences of its intervention. Such is the world, that men very loudly denounce in words what they tacitly approve in deeds. Therefore, the houses where that practice is in honour are much frequented. Has ever anyone found fault with the pleasure in quest of which he came of his own free will ? But the great art of the mistress of a house does not consist in facilitating the love intrigues of her guests ; her chief object must be the satisfaction of their vanity. That is, unfortunately, the weakest side of human nature, both with men and women. An elderly lady, reclaimed from the pomps and works of Satan, and earnestly convinced that her only aim in society is henceforth to secure the position of her children, will nevertheless feel exquisitely * The chief character in Moliere's ' Misanthrope.'"], [217, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 201 pleased by a skilful compliment concerning her youthful appearance and the freshness of her complexion. An old ambassador will delight to affect to be a great conqueror of hearts, and an unfortunate little woman, intensely silly, will regard as earnest the praises politely paid to the matchless charm of conversation. It is sufficient to praise people, whether they deserve it or not, to be held out as a perfect model of wit and manners ; people appreciate in others the high opinion professed of them by the latter. The Princesse de Sagan is wonderfully conversant with the science of society. She is a most handsome woman, has a superb figure, and is full of fascinating charm. She is a Seilliere by birth, but bears the title of the Perigord family so naturally that nobody would suspect her bour geois origin. Her mind is inquisitive, craving for sensa- tion, and, at the same time, not quite free from a certain tinge of melancholy seldom absent from those who have expected from life more than it can give. She resides in the splendid mansion which Mr. Hope, a wealthy and eccentric English gentleman, had had built there to give wonderful parties to Paris society, more indulgent towards him than the aristocracy of his own country. The peculiarity of that superb residence consists in the fact that the reception-rooms are quite distinct from the other apartments, and that a ball may be given there to twelve hundred guests without interfering in any way with the arrangements of daily life. The Princess is a devoted and fervent friend ; the cult of friendship embellishes her days, and she displays in it the refinement and activity of her nature. She takes real pleasure in supplying her visitors with the entertainments that please each and all of them best. When she gives a party, it is easy to detect the taste of her friends in the details of the organization, and in the variety of the pro gramme. She is sincerely happy whenever she can set off their talents or provide them with entertaining occupations,"], [218, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 202 and she has solved the hard problem of pleasing everybody and endearing herself to all. The secret for this consists in the fact already mentioned, that each of her words is kind and complimentary, and that she possesses the wonderful talent of speaking to each of her visitors the language he understands best, and of gratifying his particular fancy. Within the last ten years, the Hotel de Sagan has witnessed three memorable fetes. The first was a dress ball, which proved a wonderful success. Few amongst the selected few admitted to it will have forgotten the fairy sight obtained on ascending the grand staircase. The goddesses of Olympus, lovely shepherdesses, kings and mountebanks, columbines and harlequins leaning on the banister and grouped with picturesque and lovely taste, welcomed the new-comers and cheered the wearers of the best dresses, and everybody exchanged remarks and observations, toned down by the general good-humour proceeding from the genial and cheerful spirit which lasted uninterrupted from the beginning of the rout until the break of day. Two years after it was proposed to hold a peasant ball. That was shortly after the great financial disasters, in which many unlucky aristocratic speculators lost a good portion of their income, and others, far more unfortunate, lost all their fortune. It was, therefore, in very good taste to offer a cheap entertainment to those whose good humour still survived the wreck. Faithful to her custom of consulting the convenience of her friends, the Princess took up the idea of a ball, the guests at which would only require a few yards of printed cotton made up with taste. Norman, Arlesian and Turkish girls, and Watteau peasants flocked as by magic, and the prize for taste was awarded, on that occasion, to the Comtesse de Kergorlay, who looked lovely in a simple white robe, copied from Greuze's famous picture. At daybreak the visitors were still engaged in a spirited cotillon. But success cannot always be secured, and in the follow-"], [219, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 203 ing year the animal ball, the idea of which was more facetious than artistic, bore traces of the anxiety of the time and of the peculiar lull noticeable, for the last three or four previous years, in the outward manifestations of the pleasures of society. The idea was at first, nevertheless, received with favour. What, indeed, could be more entertaining than to appear in a grotesque or gallant dress at will ? \u2014 for the programme embraced endless variety in the interpretation of the instructions relative to the representation of some animal, and even went as far as authorizing the impenetrable incognito of a mask consisting of a cardboard head ! Some people may, perhaps, still remember the talkative parrot, the witty frog, and the bold cock-sparrow, whose repartees were so much enjoyed by all present that nobody could tell which of them all was the most comical. The dinner which took place before the ball was en livened by frank and unrestrained joviality. The first guests were received with cheerful gaiety, and the staircase already presented the pleasant appearance usual on such occasions. Cheers, jokes and witty remarks were bandied about, and everything seemed to go on satisfactorily. But people gradually examined each other *. the shrimp looked at the lobster, and thought it very commonplace, and so did the owl of the bat ; as for the cock and hen, they eventually realized that they were, after all, much less entertaining than they seemed at first. Doubt spread like wild-fire, and before midnight the unpleasant impression was shared by all the guests, who retired earlier than usual, with some vague feeling of dissatisfaction with them selves as with everybody else \u2014 a feeling which was but the forerunner of the impression produced by that unlucky ball on a public more envious of Parisian amusements than able to devise equivalent pleasures for itself. The petty provincial press mercilessly denounced the ball. From one end of France to the other it became the subject"], [220, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 204 of endless criticism. The harmless fancy was pointed out as the symptom of a social peril, and cardboard heads and feather dresses were held up to public execration in the name of eternal morality and of the Christian spirit. That was as ridiculous as firing grape-shot at starlings. The great mistake consisted in not having invited Monsieur Prud'homme.* Had the latter disported his frock-coat and legendary umbrella in the dazzling rooms of the Hotel de Sagan, he would doubtless have considered the ball of animals with kinder eyes, and would not have thought it necessary to cast anathema from an anti-Semitic point of view. The silly notions of the pedagogues of provincial towns or of the Latin quarter do not furnish the true reason for the relative failure of that fete ; the real cause was the fact that society no longer enjoys itself; it has momentarily lost the habit and the secret of doing so. Some vague uneasiness has invaded the minds of our contemporaries, on being confronted by all sorts of anxiety, and chiefly by the uncertainty of the future. Men seem to possess no longer the gift of insouci ance, and make it a point to lead a frivolous life sadly. The joy of being alive seems the privilege of the times in which action overrules thought ; our times, as if to react against the feverish days of the close of the Empire, are exceedingly dull. People we now meet in society are very seldom leally possessed of the activity and cheerfulness which give the impression of a perfect balance between thought and action. The prepossessing Comtesse de Montgomery is one of the rare ladies who enjoy those gifts. She is the friend of the Princesse de Sagan, and is so full of youthful grace, spirit and good-humour that there seems to be some arrant mistake in her certificate of birth. She is intelligent, witty and kind at heart. The waver- * The French personification of the narrow prejudices and scruples of middle-class or bourgeois people."], [221, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 205 ing and variable being spoken of by Montaigne seems a very imperfect portrait of woman, if we only consider the frank and open nature of that lady, whose mind is so much opposed to the intricacies and round-about ways of thought prevalent in our days. She is a sincere and devoted friend, and combines with womanly charm and tact that sound judgment and rectitude of thought which are seldom the apanage of her sex. Her conversation is a lively sport; she does not aim at witticism, and the attraction of what she says consists in its being spoken in most natural and unaffected language. Her frank and somewhat biting wit unmasks the petty lies of society, and puts fiction out of joint with a single word shot like an arrow and seldom missing its mark. Madame de Montgomery is a real providence for youth. From eighteen to twenty-five people consider her with mingled feelings of deference, fellowship, admiration and gratitude, such as one would experience towards a good looking aunt, a kind fairy, or an old tutor and friend. She excels in wrapping advice in a joke, in condensing useful instructions into a single word, and in setting off the qualities of her visitors, without appearing to take up their defence or to praise them. Nobody ever enjoyed in society a success more complete or better justified. She enter tains elderly ladies, amuses her contemporaries, and both fascinates and teaches youth, and thus delights everybody. She will ever remain young, and when entering heaven, will crack a joke with Saint-Peter, and obtain from the saintly door-keeper a good tip for the ' soul stakes,' for sport is her ruling passion and betting her favourite sin. I was anxious, dear friend, to sketch at length a figure so original in grace and open in manners. I must inform you that my admiration as an old bachelor is still attracted by a social circle that reminds one of the splendours of the Tuileries, and where the flight of years is"], [222, "206 SOCIETY IN PARIS. compensated by the imperishable charm of beauties formerly famous. The Vicomtesse de Courval, a Demoiselle Ray by birth, is one of the seven wonders whom the former secretary of the Due de Morny, whose witty articles are signed ' Quatrelles,' described in cutting, lively, disparaging, and somewhat unjust terms. She dresses with much taste ; her house is most artistically furnished ; her conversation most brilliant ; and one does not know whether to admire most the advantage she takes of the talent of her dressmaker, the resources of her mind, or her wonderfully sound artistic taste. Her residence, situated in the Rue Fortin, is a regular museum of the art of the eighteenth century. It is, perhaps, the only house in Paris where, owing to the skilful and refined taste of its owner, there is no trace of gaudy wealth, and where the smallest details are so artistic as to deserve unqualified admiration. The small, slender, delicate and elegant figure of Madame de Courval puts one in mind of the fair ladies who held courts of love in the remote past, and skilfully conversed about the gay science of love and tender feelings, whilst the stout knights, their lovers, rested at their feet after their daring fights. She could doubtless solve many hard and intricate problems connected with that delicate question, although many a complainant might appeal against her verdict in these words of Romeo : ' He jests at scars who never felt a wound.' The hotel in the Rue Fortin does not witness many fetes, but the parties held there are studied with the utmost care, and always comprise some novel and capital attraction. Once the Vicomtesse invited sixty of her friends to dinner. Six tables, each seating ten persons, and adorned with flowers of different shades, were laid for the guests, each of whom, on entering, received a small bouquet bearing his or her name besides the indication of whether he or she"], [223, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 207 was to sit at the table decorated with some tulips or at another adorned with roses or with pinks. Two years later, the Vicomtesse de Courval gave a grand ball. On that occasion the rooms were decorated after the style of Watteau's May ball, and twenty-four dancers, taken amongst the friends of the lady of the house and dressed in costumes faithfully copied from that famous picture, danced a series of steps devised formerly for the entertainment of Louis XV. The idea was, however, renewed from a fete formerly given at the Tuileries, and where the chief attraction consisted in a ballet danced by ladies, foremost amongst whom was the lovely and youthful Marquise de Galliff'et. Years have rolled by without leaving any trace on the fair and prepossessing Marquise, who looks still as pretty and as youthful to-day as she did fifteen years ago. God, that wonderful Artist, seldom leaves His work incomplete, and when He endows any of His creatures with matchless beauty, He also bestows the valuable gift of a feeling and kind heart, in order that such a being may command love as well as admiration. Beautiful and kind as she is, what else could the lovely Marquise want in order to be happy ? Alas ! she wished that she had married an officer with a silver nose or a wooden leg, if that could have prevented her husband from taking his heart abroad and never bringing it home again. The married life of the Marquise de Galliff'et was at first undisturbed, but a long residence in Algeria subsequently confirmed the fickle officer in his habits of inconstancy. We are told that Venus was volatile, whereas Mars, though jealous and brutal, was a tolerable husband. In the home of the Marquise things were just the reverse of what they were in Olympus, and the unfortunate lady was eventually compelled to confess that the African shores no longer possessed the privilege of developing antique virtues in modern Scipios, and a separation followed."], [224, "208 SOCIETY IN PARIS. Conjugal ties had been brought by the brilliant General to such a degree of elasticity that the matter was settled in the most friendly way, and it is not improbable that, at some future date, a reconciliation may be cemented by the exchange of hoary locks. But we must not wish for winter; for certain summer days possess the subdued charm of spring. So it is, at least, with the Marquise de Galliff'et, who now reckons as many triumphs as in the past, the only difference being that her present victims are the sons of her former admirers. I have already called your attention to her exquisitely kind nature, owing to which she has never ridiculed or slandered anybody. She excels in setting off the merits of other people, and possesses in perfection the rare talent which consists in never regarding herself, being amiable to all who approach her, a talent which imparts to women an ever-enduring charm. In the brightest days of the Empire, the Princesse de Metternich was on intimate terms with the four ladies of whom I have just spoken. Amongst the beauties of that brilliant period I must also mention the Comtesse Edmond de Pourtales, the Marquise de Jancourt, and the Baronne A. de Rothschild. The Princesse de Metternich, a Comtesse Sandor by birth, is a gitana, a gavroche, and a lady of rank, and the result of the combination of those various characters is a kind and intellectual woman. Her originality is quite free from affectation. Nature made her such as we see her, and a very small portion of the peculiar attraction she possesses is due to education. There is no calculation in the boldness of her words and of her way of acting. It may be asserted, without fear of contradiction, that her influence contributed singularly to help Paris society to shake off the traditions of the somewhat stiff etiquette which prevailed at the Court of Louis-Philippe, and had become the invariable rule of good company. During the emigration, the French aristocracy acquired"], [225, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 209 a taste for personal and material comfort, which continued after the Restoration ; on the other hand, it lost its habits of luxury and its natural taste for elegance. The genera tion which admired Baour-Lormian and the Vicomte d'Arlincourt sat on mahogany easy- chairs of improbable shapes, dined out of heavy, massive and ungraceful silver plate, dressed itself with awkward simplicity, and acknow ledged Girodet and Ingres as masters in art. Equally stiff and affected were the manners of that time. It was the rule for the ladies of the aristocracy to be allowed no freedom of action in their daily life. Whenever they chose to take a walk they had to be followed by a footman in livery. Few people had any taste for sport and the pleasures of country life, which latter differed scarcely from that in town. Luxury and elegance in dress were little sought for. The description of the home and of the material life of the dame aux camdias now brings a smile of pity to the lips of readers. Few middle-class women would now be satisfied with what, in those days, was considered as a great display of wealth. Under the influence of the Duchesse de Berry, the manners of society lost some of their strictness, and art and elegance again became the ruling taste. That Princess was of cheerful, impulsive and frivolous disposition. She loved pleasure with all the impetuosity of her passionate nature. Under her auspices, trinkets and finery again became the ruling passion of ladies, who began to wear more graceful and more costly dresses. Dresses, with gold and silver designs, the prices of which reached the figure of fifteen hundred francs* \u2014 an exorbitant sum for the time \u2014 were then the ruling fashion. Ladies enjoyed greater freedom ; they went out with their husbands ; some even ventured to the ball at the opera, and the Italian theatre, which was then called ' Les Bouffons,'f became the meeting place of elegant society. The revolution of 1830 brought * About \u00a360. t The jesters. 14"], [226, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 210 all this to a standstill, and the Second Empire found French society accustomed to lead a life the rigidity of which would singularly surprise the ladies of the present genera tion. The Princesse de Metternich was undoubtedly the first to be struck by the fact that the frame of social life had become too narrow for modern thought, seeing that nobody before her ever dared to pull down the older portions of that sacred edifice. With the outspoken frankness of an honest lady, she boldly proclaimed the right of every lady to enjoy herself if so inclined, to gratify her curiosity, and indulge certain pleasures hitherto reserved to the stronger sex, and to speak with perfect freedom of language. She bravely put her theory into practice, and during the fifteen years she spent in Paris, she enjoyed all the entertainments that are compatible with morality, without ever allowing the eccentricity of her manners to sink into vulgarity. No other person could have solved that problem. Success in the endeavour required her peculiar combination of boldness of thought and strictness of principles. Few people possess that marvellous gift of playing with fire without scorching themselves, and it needed a rare amount of natural dignity to frequent such low company without disgracing one's self. When the Princesse de Metternich took the liberty of playing schoolboy tricks at the very balls of the Tuileries, when she engaged There'sa to sing before the visitors of the Embassy the most racy and objectionable songs of her stock, or went to the Varietes, there to noisily applaud the actress who painted herself with such art as to mimic the Princess to perfection, that lady gave the impression of being the only person who could indulge such whims with out jeopardizing her position. What has not been said concerning the evil influence she exercised over the ways and manners of society ? Without wishing to argue the pros and cons of that ticklish question,"], [227, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 211 I will simply remark, my young friend, that such evolutions generally arise out of the very nature of things, that great and irresistible currents govern public opinion, and that so called innovators are but the spokesmen of the crowd. The task, as a rule, is too heavy for the weak shoulders of those upon whom it devolves, and the weapon often explodes in the hands of its inventor. The Princesse de Metternich has had the good fortune of teaching a novel art \u2014 the science of pleasure \u2014 to a whole society, to cheer people by joyous bursts of laughter, the echo of which is only beginning to vanish, and to take away with her to the banks of the Danube her undisputed mundane royalty. She is now a fascinating grandmother, still preserving with the more sound sense of old age the charming origin- ality of her mind. Art has now taken in her life the place of pleasure. She now devotes herself to it with the same passion she formerly displayed in mundane pursuits. She is an accomplished musician, and has greatly contributed to the spread of Wagnerism in Germany, and is certainly entitled to a large portion of the glory of each of the memorable victories of the new musical art. She also cultivates liter- ature, painting and politics, and although she sometimes pursues those studies with the somewhat blind impulse of her paradoxical mind, the manifestations of that impulse are always so unexpected as to be quite interesting. Before closing this rapid sketch of one of the most piquant characters of Paris society, I must sum up my judgment of the cause of her uninterrupted success. That success was the triumph of natural over conventional wit. That was the trump-card that enabled the lovely Ambassa- dress to win the game, and the card is so good that whoever has it may play it with confidence. Society seems to me to treat as spoilt children those who possess the talent of cheering its dulness, exciting its curi osity and furnishing it with a subject of discussion. Strange 14\u20142"], [228, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 212 as it may seem, it is nevertheless a fact that in order to secure success in society, detractors are as necessary as admirers, and that everybody gains by being discussed. People need uncommon skill and power in order to afford to dispense with enemies. Madame de Pour tal es, ' la Comtesse,' as she is termed in society, is one of those few privileged persons, and everybody understands that title to apply especially to her, as though she were the only person to bear it fitly. A kind fairy must have been present at her birth, and probably said to her : ' I give you a superior intellect, a loving heart, prepossessing charms and matchless grace. You shall be active, energetic and witty ; your judgment shall be enlightened and safe ; you shall possess every talent, virtue and attraction, and being free to choose wherein to excel, you shall rest satisfied with fascinating and pleasing people.' The secret of the lovely Comtesse consists in the concen tration of all her powers towards a single aim. That is the true road to success here below. The social life of Madame de Pourtales is a specimen of the most perfect result achieved in that direction. Since the memorable ball, where the delicate and refined beauty of Mademoiselle de Bussiere * came as a revelation to imperial society, until the present day, the life of that charming lady has been but a series of uninterrupted successes. Everybody was subdued by her seductive appearances, beneath which there are realities possessed of invincible attraction. No house is more pleasant than hers. Nowhere else does the god of friendship possess a better shrine, and if perchance the worship of the god is a pretext for perform ing certain more sacred rites, nobody seems so unconcerned about it as the person who is the object for devotion. All the members of Paris society are acquainted with the red room adorned with the famous paintings of Bronzino and * The maiden-name of the Comtesse de Pourtales."], [229, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 213 Van Dyck, surrounded by the masterpieces of modern art. The tables and whatnots are filled with rare and costly knick-knacks, offered by the faithful to the madonna worshipped in that house, and bearing witness to the deep respect and affection of the devotees. Certain princely personages are amongst the habitual guests of that house, and they are received with the affec tionate kindness compatible with the deference due to their rank. The Comte de Pourtales is an amiable and intelli gent gentleman ; his life has been spent in happiness, and his matrimonial bliss seems to have been the chief cause of the joys of his life. The fortunate couple have five children, the eldest of whom is still single, whereas the second married Mademoi- selle Cottier, a delightful impersonation of beauty, health, and the joyousness of existence. The young lady is nineteen years of age and has a lovely fair complexion ; she helps her mother-in-law to entertain six hundred guests at every party \u2014 a rather heavy task, albeit much coveted by Paris society. The Comtesse has the good taste of showing no preference in distributing her invitations ; she either invites her friends singly and verbally, or else musters them all collectively. She does the honours of her house with most unaffected grace. She certainly occupies a foremost place in society, and knows that the only way to keep her envied position is to act precisely as though she still had to win it. She was always extremely lucky, as may be seen from the following instance : She was ever warmly attached to the Emperor and Empress, but all the members of the Imperial Government did not equally share her sympathies. After the overthrow of the Empire, she bravely offered to take up the interests of the august exiles ; her ingenious devotion to their cause enabled her to take advantage of the friendships she owed to her rather anti- Governmental policy under the Empire, and she succeeded in obtaining the restitution of a great"], [230, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 214 number of valuable things. Through her intervention the Empress regained possession of nearly all the keepsakes dear to her. The loyalty of the Comtesse towards the fallen Sovereigns might have diminished her popularity. It did not. Her letter to General Ducrot, pointing out the warlike attitude of Prussia towards France, and calling attention to the preparations begun \u2014 a timely alarm, which, alas ! was not needed \u2014 was found amongst the Tuileries papers, and published with numerous other documents, most of which should have been left in utter oblivion. The publication of that letter served to prove that its handsome writer was also an intelligent patriot, and, for a long time, the delicate features of that fair beauty, reproduced by the various known processes, enjoyed the privilege of representing Alsace mourning over the loss of the mother country. Some evil-minded persons anxiously looked forward to the appearance of the handsome Comtesse at the first white ball, where she was to introduce her eighteen-year-old daughter to society. She did not keep the appointment. .... She gave that ball at an earlier date than was antici pated, and, exquisite motherly coquetry, the guests could notice that the handsome youth of her lovely daughter faithfully reflected all her own charms. Mademoiselle de Pourtales became last spring the wife of the son of General the Baron de Berckheim, himself an officer of artillery of very great promise. Following the example of the Princesse de Metternich, Madame de Pourtales cultivates music and literature. Gounod, who is one of the habitual guests of the hotel of the Rue Tronchet, aided with his valuable advice the young Baronne de Berckheim, who is now a remarkable pianist. The literary tastes of the Comtesse are enlightened and refined ; her appreciations display tact and moderation, and although they are mostly but the reflection of other people's opinions, they are expressed with so much sense"], [231, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 215 and judgment that the most fastidious find nothing to criticise either in the form or in the substance. The Comtesse de Pourtales is, with the Duchesse de Bisaccia, one of the leading figures of Paris society. It may be asserted that if the reputation of the latter is due mostly to such external circumstances as her high birth and the exalted political situation of her husband, that of the former is more personal, more cosmopolitan, and proceeds from her wonderful tact, from the matchless compliance of her mind, and from her indefatigable activity, combined with real moral and intellectual worth. The Comtesse de Pourtales will have been par excellence the lady of the nineteenth century. Her name will be mentioned in the chronicles of our times ; she will be the impersonation of our day, and will go down to posterity as well as Ninon de l'Enclos, Madame Tallien and Madame Recamier. Some future Goncourt will rise in the next century to sketch that fascinating character, and point out the serious qualities she displayed in the pursuit of her frivolous aim, when she raised the social art to the level of a science cultivated with consummate skill, thus proving the possibility of belonging to one's own time by one's ideas and intellect, without rejecting whatever was good and useful in the ways of former times, and meeting the claims of the present, whilst preserving the excellent and genial traditions of the past. The Princesse de Metternich assumed the initiative of widening the narrow rules of social etiquette, but nobody ever applied those rules with more tact, intelligence, and success than Madame de Pourtales. Quite different has been the mission of the Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild. The charming wife of the first banker of Europe was the first to proclaim the fact that dresses are ornaments, and must therefore suit the person they are intended to adorn. She was the first to teach her generation to respect the lovely work of the Creator in their persons, and to point out how the silly uniformity of"], [232, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 216 fashion deprived the salons of society of one of their chief attractions. The Baronne is sweetly pretty, and her pure Semitic features might remind one of Rachel, when her delightful smile enabled Jacob to wait seven years for her ; or Rebecca, when Eliezer was struck with her grace on meeting her at the well. Her head is small and admirably shaped, and her hair, naturally undulated, is tied so as to clear her delicate nape and fine forehead. Her nose has a charming and exquisite curve, and the girlish expression of her mouth is in perfect keeping with that of her sAveet and earnest large eyes. She belongs to the English branch of the Rothschild family, and her ways, manners, and language bear the unmistakable stamp of her English origin. She displays great elegance in her minute care of details and the thorough good taste of her dresses, and yet does her best to retain simplicity of style. She wears few jewels, and dislikes the extravagancies of fashion in that respect. She fully realizes that by imitating conventional and common- place elegance she might lose whatever individual charm her person possesses. Her deep artistic feeling is displayed in the care she takes to keep, with regard to the various portions of her dress, within discreet shape and colour ; the work of the dressmaker must be kept in the background, in order to let that of the Creator appear ; and I do not suppose that any of those whose privilege it is to meet her in society ever complained of having adopted that rule. Her manners are charming, and her conversation betokens a refined and highly-cultured mind. Her physical and moral nature possesses more delicacy than passion or energy. Curiosity and melancholy are her two chief characteristics. Her inquiring and somewhat anxious mind grows easily tired of its own investigations, and does not readily get infatuated : it is shrewd and diffident, and, under the exquisite ways proceeding from conventional amiableness, it is easy to detect a certain degree of dreariness and moral lassitude. The secret of this lies in the fact that she no longer"], [233, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 217 possesses the talent of watching the game of life with any interest. She is anxious to know the issue, but that is all ; and the fate of the stake leaves her quite indifferent. The wonderful facilities of life to her, her social triumphs, which only required from her the trouble of showing herself to win the prize, the power she enjoyed of selecting in all the civilized world the society she considered as the most refined, the most intellectual, or the most entertaining \u2014 in short, those unique elements of happiness seem to have disturbed some essential faculty of her moral being. We must not also forget that Solomon, the King of the East, crowned with gold and the most precious stones, rich in science, love, and power, and raised by Jehovah to the throne of nations, was haunted by the most despondent thoughts, and sunk in the deepest disappointment. There is something of the bitter melancholy of the Ecclesiast in the inability of the Baronne to steer here below, as also in the fact that she has experienced all the joys of this world only the better to realize the utter nothingness and vanity of the manifestations of human activity, whatever be the object. When on reaching my age, dear friend, one quietly seeks the traces of one's former desires \u2014 of one's gratified or vanished ambitions \u2014 it is plainly seen that, in the race of life, the pursuit is better than the capture. In our pursuits here below we really enjoy the passion displayed in their achievement. Nearly all the things coveted in this world are at most only worth the virtue or talent displayed in securing them ; and it often happens, even when success has crowned our efforts, that we eventually suffer more from the disappointment caused by success itself than from the hardship of the struggle. But that morose knowledge, easy to bear at a ripe age, is too heavy for a youthful mind. True, it enables it to avoid the breakers ahead, but is it not sad to hear young people say, with Lamartine, that they expect nothing from life ?"], [234, "218 SOCIETY IN PARIS. Like the Baronne de Rothschild, the Marquise de Jancourt is of English birth. She is a beautiful blonde, with perfectly regular features, reminding one of the classical type of the antique Diana; and her elegance combines British correctness with the gracefulness of her adopted country. She speaks French with a marked English accent, notwithstanding her long acquaintance with French ; but such is the charm of her musical voice that that otherwise insignificant peculiarity only adds further attraction to her conversation. The Marquise de Jancourt is a pleasant talker, equally conversant with art, literature, and politics. She belongs to the class of women who seem born especially to charm and entertain the leisure hours of busy men. Her broad intellect enables her to touch upon all the subjects that awaken the interests of distinguished men, and to follow with sympathy and judgment the various manifestations of their taste and thought ; and she has no higher ambition. Her intellec tual life reflects that of her friends. It constitutes a plea sant mirror, where they can contemplate and admire their own minds, seeing that they have deserved the valuable ap proval of the lady who so delicately preserves those pleasant relations. Certain ladies seem plainly intended by nature to play that part, accessory in appearance, but essential in reality. The lovely Marquise de Jancourt performs it with great discretion. It is only in cathedra, and quite in private, that she consents to become the adviser and arbitrator of those of her friends whose leisure hours are devoted to serious pursuits. Outside her private and strictly limited circle, she is an amiable and cheerful lady, kind and polite, and discharging with great skill and tact her social duties. The Marquis de Jancourt is a capital host, very fond of sport and horticulture. He does the honours of his shoot ing-box and of his hot-houses at Presle, with genial good grace and communicative good-humour. The number of his guests is, however, always limited. The amiable couple"], [235, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 219 are too intelligent not to dread the vulgar common-place resulting from intimate relations with too many people. In Paris the regular guests of the Hotel of the Rue de Yarenne \u2014 seldom exceeding twelve in number \u2014 meet at dinners which are regular gems of gastronomic art, and where the pleasures of conversation afford refined and delicate people the rare comfort of being from time to time in the company of their equals. The charming women to whom I have just introduced you enjoy the privilege of being the attraction of a select and intimate circle. They owe that invaluable favour to their personal charms and to the union that exists between them. Besides, that circle enjoys an uncontested superiority in society. Women constitute the charm of a society when they have the power of inducing in their guests sufficient wit to make them entertaining. In this they are powerfully helped by some sensible men whose ingenuousness delights society far more than society delights them. Amongst that class of useful promoters of social pleasures, I may mention M. Charles Haas, the Marquis du Lau, the Comte de Ganay, and the Prince Edmond de Polignac. M. Charles Haas is a confirmed bachelor, possessed of a considerable dose of natural wit, and imbued with that mundane scepticism which, when handled with reserve and good-humour, becomes at the same time an offensive and defensive weapon, marvellously suited to succeed in the difficult task of cheering life. He has to a certain extent the peculiar melancholy of those who have much fre quented society, and properly appreciate its resources. When treating that pleasant blase to the pleasure of his own conversation, one feels one acts the part of the good Samaritan. It is attractive, interesting, and fascinating, and prevents his hearers from noticing that that charming mind affects to dispense sparingly his own treasures, and prefers the modest fare he finds in others. It requires much skill to appear capable of doing without people : in so doing, one"], [236, "220 SOCIETY IN PARIS. pleases the guests, who do not seem to care much for the feast, and allows one's self to be ruled by those who enjoy it and are incapable of going without it. The Prince Edmond de Polignac is passionately fond of music. He is, moreover, a composer of great talent, and a pleasant talker whenever he pleases. He is very fond of the society of women, and displays much anxiety to fathom, as an artist and admirer, the innermost recesses of their moral life. Some very witty remarks, with a slight shade of dis appointment and aggressive disparagement, are ascribed to him. A spoilt child of society, he is blunt and whimsical ; he is, however, a sincere and true triend, and with him the claims of friendship pass before all others. His loyalty towards those he loves is that of a true disciple of Mon taigne. That amiable philosopher seems to have foreseen modern thought in a prophetic mirror. His immortal book contains advice admirably suited to the use of society people. His resigned scepticism, constituting a medium between the disappointment caused by, and the acceptation of, the trifling satisfactions of current life, is shared by the majority of well-balanced minds, conversant with the art of living in society. The reason for this is that society people agree with few of the masters of human thought. Saint- Augustine and Montaigne are alone generally understood. Since then the lesson has been repeated under various forms ; but those two schools alone find supporters. The Christian spirit, or doubt (that 'wondrous pillow for a well shaped head') \u2014 such are the two ways of thinking and feeling shared by the consciences of men. It must be confessed, to the credit of our generation, that the son of Saint-Monica possesses far more adherents than the Perigord philosopher, and that a copy of the 'Con fessions ' is more frequently seen in the hands of a man of the world than one of the Essais. I should like to know which of those two works the Marquis du Lau prefers. I"], [237, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 221 am, however, inclined to think it is the former. That nobleman is a man of great sense and taste, and constitutes a perfect specimen of the scholar and accomplished gentle man. There is no doubt that, in the good old times, he would have been a gallant knight. He belongs to a great family; and had fate called him to life in the days when a man's valour depended upon the weight of his arm, he would have worthily held his rank. Being born in the nineteenth century, he has assumed a lofty and intellectual place in modern life, finding in the pleasures of the mind a sufficient compensation for the loss of the influence and power he might have enjoyed had he been born in the past. His life is devoted to his friends and to the pursuits of his enlightened dilettantism. He is familiar with all the manifestations of art and thought; he enjoys them, and they excite his utmost interest He is a shrewd judge of men and things, has very enlightened taste, and one of the most lucid and acute intellects I have met with. He possesses in perfection the chief qualities of the French mind : clear logic and sound sense. Add to this a broad and cultivated feeling of the beautiful, and a judg ment all the more reliable from his being of a naturally cold and dispassionate disposition, opposed in all cases to preconceived ideas, and always preserving perfect freedom of appreciation in the face of the various currents dividing public opinion. He respects and extols talent wherever he sees it. He likes bold people, but cannot bear extravagant and rash ones ; and his praise of a young artist or author is regarded as a guarantee of future success. The Comte de Ganay is an impassible and correct nobleman, of refined manners and aristocratic figure. Like his eldest brother, he possesses real competence in artistic matters. His conversation is pleasant and free from com monplace; but he reserves for his friends his most intel lectual and wittiest appreciations. He has a well-balanced"], [238, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 222 nature, and is one of the fortunate and skilful few who, by their able management of ordinary abilities, succeed in securing temporal and spiritual happiness here below. He either conceals or discloses his true nature to society ac cording to the opportunity of the time, and without allowing his change of attitude to be discovered. There is great science in this, fully deserving of admiration. The fanatical observers of conventionalities are the martyrs of social duties. On the other hand, the independent beings who rudely reject all accepted ways and manners become dangerous revolutionists, from whom general sympathy is instinctively estranged. The wisest plan is to avoid care fully those two equally dangerous breakers, and to show daily a pleasant and amiable face to the public, whilst pre serving a more expressive and original face ; that is, the best of one's self, for the select circle of one's oAvn friends. I must also introduce you to some very attractive, more modern and entertaining, though essentially different, characters ; I mean the Comte Hallez-Claparede and the Vicomte Louis de la Redorte. The former is nick-named the ' Comte Oscar.' His character is the- essence of Parisianism, with its virtues and defects, its charms and inconsistencies. He is rather wanting in ideal ; and his conception of the abstract code of social and moral laws is perhaps not as perfect as one might wish. Although he greatly prizes the successes which a gentleman of his importance may secure in matters of love, nobody will ever suspect him of irksome fidelity in his preferences, or of chivalrous exaggeration in matters of sentiment. I should be very much surprised if such a confirmed bachelor were some day to take at the altar the oath to bind his inconstant heart. The Vicomte Louis de la Redorte is a jolly and cheerful fellow. He is extremely witty, and his eyes sparkle with fun ; his gestures and most insignificant words are amusing,"], [239, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 223 and he possesses the rare gift of never allowing a joke to go too far. His nature is generous and lofty ; he is most reliable in his affection, and is a safe and pleasant friend. The same may be said of the Comte Louis de Turenne, one of the most appreciated visitors of the salons I have just mentioned. He is universally liked, although for various causes. He displays kindly interest towards his fellow-creatures in general. His loyalty and devotion to his friends is beyond parallel, and towards Eve's daughters, endowed by God with the supreme gift of beauty, he pro fesses affectionate devotion, a kind of worship of his own. Personal preferences vanish in his eyes to a certain extent, and he pay^s a tender and discreet devotion to the most lovely creatures God ever made. To that indirect way of paying homage to the Maker of all things he owes the advantage of having secured the friendship of many ladies, the most charming of whom treat him with a confidence of which few men can boast. The Comte Henri de Costa does not enjoy the reputation of being such a refined idealist. He has inherited the qualities of his grandfather, the Marquis de V\u00a3rae, who represented the Government of the Restoration at Saint Petersburg, where he left recollections of a most pleasant kind. His conversation teems with witty remarks, uttered quite naturally and without any of the affectation so often noticeable in brilliant talkers visibly anxious to skilfully bring about the desired impression, and secure all the credit of it. His reputation for wit is so firmly established that certain clever young men hit on the ingenious device of becoming close friends with him, in order to sit by his side during his daily game at the club, and thus be enabled to catch his facetious or droll sayings as he utters them, so as to be able to repeat them afterwards. Unfortunately, they do not always succeed. Certain men are so peculiarly original that, whatever may be the talent of their imitators, the plagiarism is self-evident."], [240, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 224 Vice-Admiral Charles Duperre', one of the most distin guished officers in the French navy, always met in the best society, is certainly possessed of the peculiar originality of which I have just spoken. To repeat his sayings would be idle ; his wit runs freely, and owes its attraction to the rare power of his mind, and to the intense intellectual life which with him breaks forth in jokes expressive of his cheerful and genial disposition. To secure the interest of a feminine circle, or to command before the enemy, are two things of doubtless different bearing, but in which victory is, however, due to identical qualities. Women are partial to the au thority of the sterner sex, as witness the legendary weakness of Yenus for the god of battles. In order to mention all the visitors of the scdons to which this letter is devoted, I should have, my dear friend, to quote the names of at least one-fifth of the members of the French Jockey Club. I much regret being compelled to omit the sketches of some very tempting figures. When I speak of the salons of the Rue Tronchet, of the Hotel de Sagan, of the tasty and artistic museum presided over by the Vicomtesse de Courval, crowds of witty men, brilliant talkers and learned scholars, at once cross my mind. Here, for instance, is the Comte Edmond de Lambertye, whose intellectual face denotes the placid nonchalance which forms the chief characteristic of his nature. He ad mires feminine beauty with the eyes of an artist rather than with those of an enthusiast, and is the faithful guest of several much appreciated five-o'- clock teas, and applies his wit to evoke that of other people for his own delectation. He will freely express some bold theories, and much enjoy the indignant protests of his fair hearers. It is very amusing to hear his drawling voice dwelling complacently and in low tones on some aphorism, whose full meaning, suddenly breaking forth in the midst of his hearers, raises a regular storm amongst them. Such incidents cause intense de-"], [241, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 225 light to M. de Lambertye. His lovely wife, the daughter of the Duchess of Sotomayor, is not yet sufficiently acquainted with the niceties of the French language to appreciate all the charms of such a treat. She listens and admires with all the more confidence that she needs no proof in order to believe sincerely in the wit of her gifted husband. The hair of the Vicomte de Dreux-Breze has grown pre maturely white, and sets oft' his fine features to advantage. He is a very pleasant gentleman, although rather self-willed. His wife, who is a La Ferronnays by birth, is a consummate musician, and, with marvellous art, uses her admirable voice, a contralto, in warm and passionate accents. Few are allowed the opportunity of appreciating that matchless talent, and the best and most deserved compliment that can be paid to the noble artist is to say that on the stage she would have eclipsed the glory of Alboni. The young Comtesse Reille, her daughter, has inherited her lovely voice. I must not forget to mention the name of the Comte de la Bourdonnaye, whose exquisite manners enhance the value of his reliable and agreeable company. Unfortunately, he seldom gratifies the wishes of his friends, and always has some good excuse for not keeping his appointments. A certain amount of natural nonchalance, and a kind of mania in his bachelor's habits, are the chief causes of his antipathy to social circles. When, perchance, he goes to a party, he affects, during his visit, a certain amount of in- difference and unconcern, which enables him to conceal from the public the best of his moral and intellectual powers. The few persons to whom he discloses his true individuality are quite surprised at the depth and originality of his views. His brother, who represents the constituency of Maine-et- Loire in the existing Legislature, combines with some of those qualities the skill and daring that open the road to success in the struggle of life. He is a most intelligent and proud-look- 15"], [242, "226 SOCIETY IN PARIS. ing personage, and a remarkable speaker besides. He married Mademoiselle d'Esgrigny, by whom he has five children, the eldest of whom, a daughter, married a few months ago, will doubtless soon make a remarkably young grandfather of him. This aristocratic society is full of charming and attractive elements. Its members are all select, and practise the art of life with marvellous refinement. Its chief attraction consists, however, in the fact that kind expressions are held in great honour, and slander or severe judgments strictly banished from its circles. Owing to the influence of some of the ladies of society, nothing is considered more unbecoming than to make fun of people, and the wit spent in dwelling on the ludicrous side of people's characters finds few admirers there. That last point is, in my opinion, quite sufficient to justify the unreserved praise I have thought fit to bestow on this portion of Paris society. Does it not indeed require a marvellous association of will and intellect to enforce the collective practice of the most bewitching of virtues ? The fact is, my young friend, that having already lived a good deal and thought much, there is nothing I prize so much now, at my ripe age, as a kindly heart. Nearly all the manifestations of human genius discover, sooner or later, their own hollowness, that their usefulness is only relative, some adverse element thwarts or annuls its efforts. Works of kindness alone are not subjected to that law. So long as humanity exists here below, there will be unfortunate people, and only those who have applied themselves to relieve, in whatever degree, the sufferings of their fellow-creatures, will not have wasted their time. Whoever, disregarding his own sympathies or antipathies, shall in all things display noble perseverance in counteracting the effects of ill-will and hatred by means of pity and compassion, will secure the respect and sympathy of all. Though his actions will frequently be barren in their result for others, they will not be so for himself. Life has no snares for those who seek justice through love, and"], [243, "SEQUEL TO PRESENT SOCIETY. 227 the redress of wrongs through charity, the only road to progress, the only means of securing unlimited moral per fection. There is not merely virtue and wisdom, but also supreme skill, in being good and kind in the broadest acceptation of those words, and in realizing the fact that life does not consist simply in the regard for our interests, but in real indulgence and charity. We must not make merely bare concessions to that idea ; such would be vain and barren in result. It would be like the liberalism of an absolute king. . . . . We must resolutely accept it, and follow it up without restriction or selfish reserve, and only retain that which will enable us to be morally and materially more useful to our fellow-creatures. Such a line of conduct con stitutes the very essence of social duties ; it is the supreme source of all the rules of good breeding, and the sole plausible explanation of the tenets of social relations. When a superficial observer examines the by-ways and contradictions of that code of rules, he feels inclined to think it is absurd to endeavour to formulate a moral law which is changeable, and subjected to the whims and fancies of current public opinion, and that the wisest plan is to submit blindly to it Avithout trying to understand it. That is, however, a great mistake ; the only way of sub mitting to that law Avithout suffering from it is to practise charity resolutely. Every one of the rules of society con tains the germ of deeds of devotion, self-negation, and sacrifice .... The practice of those deeds makes life bear- able and pleasant, whatever pessimists may say to the contrary, and men must have no other object than to perform a long series of similar deeds with the sole ambition of reaching unlimited perfection, the croAvning goal of Avhich should alone be the realization of the supreme hope of Christians .... Thus, mundane life, notvvithstanding its failings and frivolity, embraces and promotes the broadest conception of duty .... The great point lies in detecting 15\u20142"], [244, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 228 and fully grasping that important truth .... When, thanks to the wise experience taught by the course of years, or rather in obedience to the noble dictates of a generous heart, one at last perceives it, it remains one's sole guide .... than which there is no purer. That truth it was that lit up the sublime soul of Sakya Muni Avhen, ad dressing the mother whose child was dead, he said : ' Sister, the whole universe is mourning over your bereavement.'

THE GOLDEN CALF. We have reached, my young friend, the delicate portion of my undertaking. Having made up my mind to acquaint you with the various matters observed by me in the highest circles of Parisian society, I must dwell at some length on the ever-groAving and deplorable tendencies Avhich modify the exclusive spirit of the aristocracy. I mean the alliances which have gradually taken place between financial circles and the members of the old nobility of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. That action is to be ascribed to the general current of the spirit of the age, which more and more induces the rising genera tions to join in the worship of the golden calf \u2014 an essentially modern god, although borroAved from the Bible \u2014 the observance of the rites of Avhich seems to become a necessity of our times. The periods at which social life is subjected to sudden and deep modifications are those when the moial fibre of"], [245, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 229 the public is most relaxed. Moral atony is most favourable to the rapid evolution of ideas. Our unfortunate century seems out of breath at its close ; people's characters seem to have lost their energy, and modern impulse meets with but little resistance. The consciences of most men seem plunged in utter confusion, and submit readily to outAvard influences. Those influences now tend to teach youth the contempt of the ideas in which it was brought up. That fact is singularly paradoxical. Indeed, at the very moment when experimental science, having successfully transferred the application of its methods from the study of material facts to that of moral facts, triumphantly points out the favour able influence the respect of traditions has had on societies, modern society applies itself Avith blind fury to destroy the still existing ties Avhich bind it to the past. There is not much credit in destroying, although that seems now the ruling fashion. The old beliefs, undermined on various sides at once, are shaken to their foundations, and the confusion noAV existing betAveen sound conviction and prejudice much Aveakens the former. E\\Terybody noAV has some vague feeling that it is humiliating to be ruled by what others thought and believed before him. Men are ashamed of being guided by the appreciations and feelings of forgotten ancestors, and consider it an honour to invent a morality and \u00e6sthetics of their own. . . But those things cannot be improvised. People who reject the traditions of their class only succeed in causing themselves to be tossed about all their lives by the changing notions of the day. Such are some of the causes which furthered the easy spread of modern ideas ; but there are others, of higher order, proceeding from facts related to the moral life of individuals. Men of the nineteenth century possess psychical qualities which make them peculiarly accessible to material temptations. The psychology of modern man still remains to be written."], [246, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 230 M. Paul Bourget, much to his credit, was the first to study literature and love from that critical point of view. But there is still an immense field opened to investigation ; will and ambition offer numerous subjects of study as yet unexplored. Biographies have been Avritten, but the history of the true state of people's souls, and of the various manifestations of their passions, has still to be recorded. No writer has as yet fathomed the depths of conscience wherein desire takes place, impressions are reflected, and human actions planned. Goethe's ' Faust ' is perhaps the best type of the ideali zation of Avhat often happens in our days. He sought in the mysteries of science the satisfaction of his curiosity, and the quenching of his thirst for the ideal. He failed to grasp the logical sequence and deduction of his ideas betAveen the data furnished by his reason and the life here after held up by early teachings, or assimilated by his mind in childhood. At last, disgusted with his vain inquiry, he resolutely enters practical life, having made up his mind to expect from existence only tangible satisfactions, and Avillingly devoting the energy of his faculties to replace the cult of abstraction by the pursuit of reality. He nevertheless preserves in the innermost recesses of his heart the despondency caused by his deceived hopes, and the desperate regret of having melted in the crucible of a vain study the idealism of the old masters. He still believes vaguely in the existence of a higher sphere of ideas and sentiments, a serene region Avhich he failed to enter, and the melancholy caused him by the loss of his dream induces him to pursue with increased eagerness the realization of his desires, and to pursue only what is tangible and real, reserving for the ideal, the vain pursuit of which caused him such cruel deception of feeling, the unremitting and relentless contempt of a betrayed lover."], [247, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 231 When Moses descended Mount Sinai, bearing in his faithful hands the tables of the law, he found that the Israelites, despairing ever to see their leader again, had manufactured a golden calf and Avorshipped it. That is the history of modern man. The golden calf is still erect in our days ; and noAV, more than ever, those whose eyes Avere vainly fixed on the sacred mount, in expectation of deliverance, have given up their hopes, and dance before the idol, Avhilst singing the epithalamium of material joys. Amongst those converts some were doomed to apostasy from the days of their youth. The limited compass of their narroAV minds Avas only capable of grasping the material pleasures of life ; but Avhat is the sole aim of some people is but a makeshift for others, Avho sooner or later must come to consider it as such. The latter display, in the lively competition of brutal desires, the powerful energy Avhich, under better circumstances, might have been devoted to nobler Avorks. The Avorshippers of the golden calf now number legions ; and an impartial observer may in vain light the lantern of Diogenes in order to discover a disinterested impulse in men's hearts and consciences. Money is the modern god, representing as it does, on the one hand, the most efficient lever of ambition, and, on the other, the gratification of material Avants and of the love of pleasure.

You will"], [248, "232 SOCIETY IN PARIS. then detect those suspicious recesses of a man's nature which justify the fear that all lofty feelings have dis appeared ; those ugly depths in conscience which bear witness to that disappointing truth, and often record the unfortunate story of gradual corruption. A whole volume, my young friend, Avould be required in order to note the various symptoms of the slow moral degradation of the men of our time, and examine its causes and results. I shall confine myself to sketching the broad lines of that question, although in so doing I shall, I knoAV, make painful discoveries. It Avould be a great mistake to think that the cult of Avealth, and the poAver it confers, are neAv things. Under Louis XIV. and Louis XV., financiers were the equals of Princes. La Bruyere's immortal book* contains eloquent criticisms of the insolence of the financiers, and of the absence of dignity on the part of the aristocracy of his time. As M. Masson ably shoAvs, in his book on the Marquis de Grignan, the great names of France were most cynically sold in the brightest days of monarchy. If Ave go back to those already remote times, in order to study the manners of society in that respect, we find that things proceeded then exactly as they do now. Material prosperity and the flight of progress had de veloped covetousness to the detriment of higher aspirations. The evil was even much greater toAvards the close of the reign of Louis XV. than it is in our days. In the year of our Lord 18S7, men's consciences have not yet reached the degree of abasement which could easily be noticed a hun dred years ago, during the days that preceded the Revolu tion. Love of lucre and its mean desires reigned as masters, and the most shameful vices openly paraded themselves. Morality, honesty, and the sense of shame were appealed to only by the Avorst characters, and in order to conceal their ignominy. The piquant plainness with Avhich the Abbe' * ' Les Caracteres.'"], [249, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 233 PreVost relates the unfortunate adventures of a courtesan and of a sharper, conveys a fair idea of the indulgence with Avhich, OAving to their frequency, similar cases Avere received by a relatively respectable public. That novel is the only floAver that grew out of such corruption : it is a faithful mirror of the manners of the time. The work is interesting, and will always be so, like all spontaneous and sincere productions. It happens that a time, a period, a certain state of mind are, at a given moment, reflected in a work Avhich somebody AA'rites Avithout any set purpose, but which survives as a permanent witness of a transient crisis. Such is the origin and the secret of the success of the history of Man on Lescaut. The eighteenth century confessed itself in these pages : the same wind of corruption was passing over all classes of society. What else are Louis XY. and La Dubarry, if not Desgrieux croAvned and Manon triumphant ? The Revolution broke out in the midst of that decrepit society, and destroyed thousands of lives virtually and actually. It is hard to imagine such a catastrophe as that Avhich drove the members of the most refined and polite society from their mansions and residences into prisons, into miserable hovels, or into exile ! The majority of those people displayed a courage superior to those terrible trials, and few allowed their spirit to be crushed. As a rule, the aristocracy behaved far better in gaols than during the emigration. The immi nence of the danger, and the dramatic and stirring circum stances of the time, increased people's courage, and raised their characters to the height of the struggle. WThen the storm was over, the members of society Avere happily surprised to Avitness the rehabilitation of their state of existence, and to realize the possibility of reforming a social circle similar in many respects to that Avhich, they thought, had vanished for ever. At any rate, the severe lesson of adversity Avas not unproductive of good results. Society framed its life on neAv bases. Aristocratic families became"], [250, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 234 the homes of domestic virtues and most respectable schools of moral dignity ; and several generations followed, bequeath ing to each other austere and simple manners, and lofty and proud moral principles bravely put into practice. Simplicity in material life, strict selection in social rela tions, and a deep feeling of the duties of the members of the higher classes towards their inferiors, constituted the tradition of good company. I have already mentioned what Avas the influence on art and fashion of the narroAv rules of etiquette then in force. That was evidently their draAvback ; but this small incon venience Avas amply compensated by the numerous moral advantages of the neAv state of things. The aristocracy adopted the virtues of the middle classes, and practised them Avith grandeur. The homes of the upper classes were kept on a footing of tbe utmost simplicity, and all studied Avealth and ele gance were systematically banished from them. Appear ances were neglected ; the dignity, the comfort, and the conveniences of life Avere alone cared for. The servants, dressed in badly cut and seldom renewed liveries, Avere abundantly fed and liberally paid, and treated Avith great kindness. Their defects were endured ; they grew old in the service of their masters, to whom they became so attached as to prefer them to their oAvn relations, and to request as a favour the permission to die under the roof Avhich they had come to consider as their own. The furniture was not artistic, but comfortable, and kept Avith scrupulous care and cleanliness. The mistresses of houses regarded it as an honour to personally superintend the most insignificant details of housekeeping. Much care was taken in securing the excellence of the fare and the quality of the Avines, not so much by means of outlay, as by the exercise of strict economy. The same remark applies to the administra tion of fortunes. Wise savings, much personal supervision, great liberality in giving generously whenever needed,"], [251, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 235 and no ostentation \u2014 such Avere the rules framed for the management of the material life of the aristocracy. The great point with the majority of the upper classes was to avoid debts, to visit only their equals, to make no concession to vanity, and, by the strict observance of rigid manners, to raise their social considerations, Avhich had been diminished by the unlucky events of the time. These tradi tions were preserved throughout the first half of the century. Even in our days, as I have already pointed out, certain families are still imbued with those traditions ; and there are reasons to believe that they will be preserved by them. Thirty years ago the aristocracy Avould have considered it undignified in them to associate Avith the members of the financial Avorld on a footing of equality, and money matches Avere considered as painful necessities. The scantiness of people's resources was no obstacle to their leading the same life as their equals. In those days it Avas not necessary to be rich to go into society. Most young married ladies paid their visits on foot, and cheerfully put up Avith one dress every season. It Avas then the custom to give in the Faubourg Saint- Germain, chiefly during Carnival, little dancing-parties to young people, to Avhich young married ladies Avere invited, and from which all sIioav Avas carefully banished. The guests Avere feAV ; there Avas no costly display of flowers and lights, and the refreshments consisted simply of fruit-Avine and cakes \u2014 as for suppers, they Avere conspicuous by their absence. Of course those parties did not last much beyond midnight. After dancing to their hearts' content, the guests hired a cab to take them home, and enjoyed similar entertainment the next day. The upper classes Avere quite satisfied with the simple amusements, and would under no pretence have accepted from people whom they con sidered as their inferiors invitations Avhich they could not return. They much preferred the deprivation of costly plea sures to the humiliation of incurring obligations. They"], [252, "236 SOCIETY IN PARIS. were exceedingly clannish. Ladies prided themselves upon keeping their salons jealously closed against all intruders. That scrupulous selection, owing to Avhich the little parties mentioned above were quite private, constituted their greatest attraction ; and the presence of a single intruder would have greatly marred the pleasure of the guests. Such was the life led by the aristocracy until the dawn of the Second Empire. Then only happened isolated facts in contradiction Avith current usage. Young married couples began to live in greater style than their parents. The changes thus introduced related at first to insignificant details. Eventually the austere rules inherited from one's family seemed too narroAv ; and people endeavoured, not too obviously, to get rid of them, and resorted to endless sub terfuges in order to appear to respect in globo principles against each of which they cleverly trespassed. Gradually the opposition to former manners gained more ground, and as the influence of Avomen is supreme in such matters, it Avas easy to notice, almost in every family, a marked difference between the ways of the mothers and those of their daughters. Those divergencies led necessarily to the forsaking of austere manners and the simplicity of life for the extension of social relations, the love of wealth, and the gratification of vanity. The upper classes lived on a grander scale ; they made the acquaintance of plutocrats, who soon became their friends. ToAvards the close of the Empire, the amalgamation betAveen the tAvo societies was complete ; and since the war, the social consideration enjoyed by moneyed people has so increased that the fact of being the wife of a lucky banker noAV confers more advantages and rights of precedence than does that of bearing the name of some descendant of the Crusaders. How did such a sudden change take place ? How could people, in the short lapse of tAventy years, come to so forget"], [253, "THE GOLDEN C.ILF. 237 the ancient pride of their class ? I often heard people talk of the clever endeavours on the part of the members of the financial Avorld to secure the aid and confidence of the aristocracy. I never believed, hoAvever, in an action com bined with sufficient skill and harmony to secure success in that direction. Whatever Avrath my sincerity may provoke, I consider it but right to state, in justice to the upper classes, that the initiative of that new alliance can only be ascribed to them. The French nobility, forgetting its traditional pride, Avas the first to hold, out its hand to the members of the aristocracy of wealth ; I make use of that expression in the figurative and, alas ! also in the real sense. NeAV manners had created situations in which necessity becomes law. The upper classes, having given up their habits of simple life and economy, were obliged to gratify, on one hand, their greed of pleasure, and, on the other, to fill up the gap existing betAveen their material resources and new requirements. There Avas an easy solution of that difficulty : it consisted in the amalgamation of the two societies, one of which brought honour, and the other money. Thus the French nobility purchased, at the expense of much of its former prestige, the increase of its Avelfare, and the means of living in greater style ; in my humble opinion it secured the best bargain. Indeed, there are social elements which are beyond material valuation ; as soon as they are subjected to the laAV of exchange, they are considered as the equivalents of certain material advantages, and, for that very reason, lose irremediably all the value that attached to them. The exclusion and the loftiness of feelings of the aris tocracy represented an entity : the pride and virtues inherited from ancestors. From the day that the privilege of belonging to it was used as a means of acquiring Avealth and pleasure, it lost its moral significance. I feel, therefore, inclined to think that the aristocracy of"], [254, "238 SOCIETY IN PARIS. money was rather duped in the bargain. It bought and paid cash doAvn for a merchandise which became worthless from the very fact of its being sold. That way of looking at the matter is, besides, gaining ground. M. Poirier* now refuses his daughter to the Marquis de Presles, unless the latter impresses him with the fact that he possesses the ideas and virtues Avhich Poirier practised all his life. Ladies belonging to the world of finance little care for the acquaintance, and even for the intimacy, of ladies of title .... It may be interesting to follow the progress of the evolution which brought about such a profound modifi cation in the ways of French society. Social facts of such importance do not occur suddenly. When the sea encroaches upon the coast, it is not by the sudden rushing of the tide against the strand, tearing away a mass of earth and rocks, and taking possession of the space thus conquered. Slowly, daily the tide gains a little ground, undermines the sand and the rock, until some fine day the shore gives way, and the victorious tide covers its ruins. Thus the new social and economical theories insidiously made their Avay. The position of the members of the aristocracy became seriously involved Avhen they began to live on a footing incompatible Avith their means. Wives then began to use their influence over their husbands to in duce the latter to follow the example of those of their school-fellows, or of their friends at the club, Avho, by securing friends in the world of finance, managed to increase their incomes. Eve's daughters are, as a rule, ingenious and self-Avilled, but they consider more their aim, and the advantages they are likely to reap, than the means to be employed in its pursuit. Besides, the ladies of the upper classes, being brought up to respect conventional ideas, have often more imagination than practical sense. On the * The type of a retired tradesman, in the famous play entitled 1 Le Gendre de Monsieur Poirier.'"], [255, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 239 other hand, the men of the aristocracy, although generally possessed of average intellect, have two peculiar character istics Avhich prevent their treating financial matters Avith competence and success. They have no taste for close work, and having always been accustomed to deal with honest men like themselves, they lack the circumspection that is indispensable for success. The necessity for diligence, and for being tied doAvn to one's work, further constitutes a serious difficulty ; office life is irksome to one Avho has always been accustomed to see his OAvn people dispose of their time as they pleased. It should, hoAvever, be borne in mind that the majority of the fathers of the young men of Avhom I am speaking, being kept aAvay from official careers by their political opinions, had spent their hves in idleness. Being thus already dis gusted with Avork, the members of the upper classes only sought for lucrative sinecures. A great number of them managed to obtain them by giving their social influence in return for seats on the managing boards of great com panies, or for advice useful in speculating profitably on the Exchange. Within the last tAventy years there must have been thousands of those tacit transactions in Avhich aristocratic patronage was given in exchange for financial patronage, and there is no doubt that they even occur in our days. Plausible pretexts are easily found : the Avish, for instance, of reneiving former acquaintance made at college, or later, Avhen enjoying life as a young man. . . . Both friends are now married. The young wife of the titled gentleman is elegant and good-looking ; her marriage portion was small, but not so her craving for Avealth and pleasure. She has hardly been married three years Avhen the greatest difficulty is experienced in meeting the expenses of housekeeping. Her husband then recollects having formerly had as school-fellow the son of some Avealthy financier. He easily gets himself elected as"], [256, "240 SOCIETY IN PARIS. member of the club to which his former friend belongs, and the acquaintance is renewed OAving to the kind initiative of the nobleman, Avelcomed, hoAvever, with prudent reserve by the party whom he tries to ensnare. In the meantime the latter also gets married ; he takes to Avife his cousin in order to amalgamate two banking concerns possessing millions in all the markets of Europe. At first his young Avife was satisfied to dazzle with her wealth the social circle in which she always lived. But ambition springs up in her pretty head; she fancies she Avould like to make the acquaintance of the ladies she meets at the opera, or at the races, and especially of the lovely Marquise whose husband is on intimate terms with her own, and, Avhenever meeting her, at the Bois de Boulogne or elsewhere, bows to her politely and Avith such distant respect. That respect exasperates her ; she longs to have him introduced to her in order to see him replace his stuck up and affected courtesy to her by a little more affableness. She has acquainted her lord and master with that wish, which did not seem much to his taste. Of course her desire might be satisfied, but it would be costly. For along time he has turned a deaf ear to the insidious proposals of his former school-felloAv, who, whenever he meets him at the club, dwells at length on the necessity of living with the times, and on the opportunity of giving up one's prejudices, the regret he feels at not having anything to do, and his natural taste for business. One day, at last, the financier interrupts bluntly the Avell-known tirade, and bids his friend to come and see him some morning in order to arrange matters. The intervieAv takes place and is most cordial. On coming home to lunch, the nobleman informs his wife that she is invited to the next performance at the opera, an nounces a quite unexpected increase to their income, and inquires anxiously after the various houses open to them. The little Marquise, though unaAvare of what is going on,"], [257, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 241 nevertheless discovers that the banker's wife is perfectly charming. A couple of days after the first interview, she finds occasion to address to that lady some insignificant note concluding with the assurance of her most friendly regards, and, by the greatest of chances, she gets her friends, her grand-cousins, and even the bosom friend of her brother, whose conscience she directs at her tea-parties, to share her favourable opinion towards her new ac quaintance. You will easily understand, my dear friend, that there are many other ways to succeed in those negotiations ; but, as I already Avarned you, trade is not so good now as it used to be. Financiers have iioav secured their admission into society on a footing of equality Avith people of birth. The salons of the charming wives of our modern Samuel Bernards* are frequented by a croAvd of titled visitors. You could only mention two or three originals, Avell knoAvn for the eccentricity of their manners, Avho purposely avoid those universally appreciated circles. When members of the aristocracy now dine in tOAvn, they eat, nine times out of ten, meat slaughtered according to the precepts of Moses. Whoever cares to frequent society and live in the midst of his contemporaries, must be introduced to the Mont morencys of finance ; failing which, he could only see coteries, forming an insignificant fraction of Parisian society, the most brilliant side of which Avould remain unknown to him. The majority of the salons of the aristocracy of the Faubourg Saint-Germain are now closed, or seldom open their doors, and, but for a feAV brilliant exceptions, they have ceased to be centres of social activity, being replaced in that respect by the draAving-rooms of the world of finance. * A famous financier, whose fortune amounted to the then fabu lous sum of thirty-three millions of francs. He was ennobled by Louis XIV. 16"], [258, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 242 A book called ' La France Juive,' which last year secured great success OAving to the general curiosity it aroused, called attention to the fact I have just mentioned, and ascribed its cause to the omnipotence secured in our days by the Semitic race. At first, I was induced to bestow some attention on that Avork, which, I now think, deserves more the name of libel than that of essay. Some historical inquiries into the formation of Jewish society, its state at the beginning of the Christian era, and its progress through the Middle Ages, did not seem devoid of interest. But it became fastidious reading as soon as the libels of the pamphleteer replaced the attractive, though not always strictly reliable, erudition of the historian. Finally, the second volume of that indigestible work im pressed me with the fact of being a tissue of absurdities, in Avhich the audacity of the author's allegations is only sur passed by the thorough ignorance displayed in the treatment of the subject. M. Drumont shows us a society observed in the dim light of taverns, further obscured by the stink ing smoke of pipes. His picture of the old French society is as fanciful as that of the Jeivish world, and as is the case generally Avhen passion takes the place of critical spirit, his judgment of his contemporaries is superficial; he overlooked the deep and real causes of the tendencies which he pointed out. It is but too plain a fact that the upper classes practise more and more the Avorship of the golden calf, that the cult of idealism and the love of noble abstractions are daily groAving weaker and make more room for the blind pursuits of material joys and the calculations of ambition. The evil lies in the increase and spread of desires, as also in the fact that men's natures are noAV of a lower standard than in the past, and it strikes me, my young friend, that the author of ' La France Juive ' is scarcely qualified to under take the cure of diseases from which he seems to suffer"], [259, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 243 much himself. M. Drumont appears to me to constitute a very curious pathological case, the study of which would be out of place here, but which may be easily summed up in a few words. He worships and serves the golden calf Avith the whimsical, uncompromising, and extreme origin ality displayed by the late Barbey d'Aurevilly* in the de fence of your holy mother, the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church. He is a materialist in the same Avay as the latter was a mystic, with the difference that he is thoroughly unconscious of it; at any rate, that is his only point of resemblance with D'Aurevilly's stern, lofty, and religious character. Style and syntax are most unceremoniously treated by the author of ' La France Juive/ whereas the author of ' La Vieille Maitresse 't is an artist of matchless talent. It is not the rule to employ as doctor the inmate of a madhouse, and I may be permitted to remark that M. Dru mont does not seem to me to enjoy the qualifications that might justify his opening a school of morals. He is a journalist at heart, and does not possess any of the genial qualities or the intellectual training which make thinkers. To deserve that title it is necessary to have left the arena of vulgar ambitions, to have acquired a serenity of soul that will enable its possessor to consider things from the loftiest point of view, to feel more pity than indignation for the inevitable human weakness, and to sympathize deeply Avith the sufferings of mankind. Only when, by dint of energy and reflection, one has reached that elevation of views, can one judge his fellow-creatures Avith impartiality, and try, Avith some chance of success, to remedy their evils. I see amongst my contemporaries many such doctors of the human soul, thoroughly and deeply versed in the -social science, amongst whom I may mention Alexandre Dumas, Taine, * A satiric French writer and staunch supporter of the Church. He died a few months ago. f One of Barbey d'Aurevilly's works. 16\u20142"], [260, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 244 and Renan. Although I do not share all their opinions, I readily admit their right to examine the sores of poor old mankind, to point out the possible causes of its infirmities, and to propose some means of cure. I should not, however, dear friend, take upon myself to advise you in confidence to folloAv the teachings of any of the masters of modern psychology. I do not believe that any of us has a right to entrust the direction of his conscience to anybody but himself, or to abdicate in the hands of another person, however much gifted, the sacred right of judging and acting according to the powers God has granted to all thinking beings. I must nevertheless confess that the impassioned language of M. Alexandre Dumas found an echo in my heart and conscience when, in a figure borroAved from the Apocalypse, he shoAvs us the nineteenth century grand and admirable in so many respects, and yet inwardly consumed by some invisible and dreadful cancer. He saw the Beast looking doAvn victoriously from the cloud, and he showed it to the people Avhom it devours. He disclosed the fact that modern society is ailing and losing its strength, and that family and country are betrayed simply because love is being sold. That suggested a painful comparison, and I realized that the story of Danae is not a mere fable, that beauty is not the only fatal result of birth and race purchased and sold in our days .... and that alerions, bezants, and even fleurs de-lys have witnessed bargains Avhich the men who wore them first would have indignantly declined. Where is the remedy to those evils ? for it would be grievous to notice the decadence if there Avas no hope of recovery. The remedy lies in the observance of the law of work. The levelling tendencies of the time will be checked by the heroic blood which still runs in the veins of the aristocracy. The political poAver of the French nobles was broken up by the heavy hand of Richelieu ; under Louis XIV., who, nevertheless, called himself the first gentleman"], [261, "THE GOLDEN CALF. 245 of France, they lost their social influence, and finally the Revolution deprived them of their most valuable privilege, that of shedding their blood for their country ; the SAVord of the aristocracy ceased to be that of France. The upper classes then assumed a haughty reserve, which Avas not devoid of grandeur. They remained in expectation. An appeal suddenly sounded and Avas heard .... It was that of the antique myth of the golden cloud, and Danae received Jupiter. But another and better appeal will soon be heard. The aristocracy will understand that the amount of virtue, honour, and courage it represents constitutes a sacred trust, and one of the main forces of the country, Avhich has a right to it, and that it is indispensable to fructify that trust by work. I Avish the upper classes Avould abandon their prejudices, and, preserving their noble and proud con victions, employ in useful careers their natural talents, and what still remains of the influence and prestige of their great names. Commerce, the various branches of industry, agriculture, the colonization of distant lands, are all opened to the development of tlie activity of the upper classes. Pioneers of progress, they will thus resume the tradition of devotion and daring gallantry handed doA\\m to them by their ancestors contemporary of the great days of monarchy. The change is near at hand ; the hour of regeneration will soon strike. The faint light, forerunner of the daAvn of the great revival, is already perceptible."], [262, "246 SOCIETY IN PARIS. NINTH LETTER. THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. The various manifestations of art much engross the minds of the upper classes. As I do not wish to depart from the rule I have adopted of being impartially truthful, I will presently acquaint you with a grave suspicion that has crossed my mind. It is now within the reach of everybody to do a little music, to spoil paints and indulge in a little daubing. Certain accomplishments offer a large field to the ambition of amateurs, but respect for truth compels me to disclose the fact that the chief reason that induces the upper classes to give their preference to painting consists in the facility with Avhich they can secure discreet collaboration in their practice of that art. There is so little difference between the theoretical and the practical advices \u2014 with occasional illustration \u2014 of a master, Avho takes an interest in the success of a pretty young lady, his pupil ! One may well overcome some scruples of conscience in order to secure a rich harvest of praise by the production of an artistic work of real merit, intended as a present to some friends. Much judgment is therefore required in the choice of a guide. I should, if I dared, advise my lovely friends to select a robust professor likely to live to an advanced age. It is so irksome to have to complete, alone, work that pro ceeded so satisfactorily with a collaborator's help. One can scarcely imagine the modifications which a change of direc tion is likely to introduce into the process of an amateur's talent ; indeed, the pupil could append his name to the productions achieved under the guidance of the first master, Avhose style he could only be reproached with copying too faithfully; whereas his subsequent Avorks bear so plainly"], [263, "THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. 247 the stamp of the new professor, that it seems impossible for anyone to alter his oAvn style so quickly, so that the pupil must either give up his Avork or wait until his friends have forgotten his style. The ladies of the upper classes seem to possess to a much greater extent than the pupils of the School of Fine Arts the poAver of assimilating the qualities of the artists who advise them. It is quite the reverse in literature, it being far more difficult to turn to useful account the knowledge of other people in that branch of art. Style is the language of the soul. With a little practice it is easy to detect the changes of manner. Two minds, accustomed to exchange their impressions and to share to gether their intellectual powers, may, it is true, succeed in producing perfect and unbroken works ; but cases similar to those resulting from the collaboration of the brothers De Goncourt and of MM. Erckmann and Chatrian are very seldom met with. A successful writer will generally lose by working in collaboration Avith a confrere. The feathers of the jay do not harmonise Avith those of the peacock. It frequently happens that cultured noblemen and poli ticians take advantage of the means placed at their disposal to secure help in their labours. The fact of gathering information, checking figures, or collecting documents, con stitutes a thankless task, Avhich one may take pleasure to superintend, but can easily dispense to perform personally. Saving of time is, at any rate, in that case, the only real advantage. Besides the reason to which I called your attention in order to explain the preference given by the members of society to artistic pursuits, it must be granted that the latter constitute an elegant occupation, more in keeping Avith the tastes and duties of society. The members of the upper classes want to fill their leisure in a pleasant manner, and to seem to do exclusively what amuses them most."], [264, "248 SOCIETY IN PARIS. Society people generally display singular aptitudes for literature, and an artistic feeling rather keen and correct, though containing more ingenuousness than breadth and depth of views. The upper classes never produced a truly great artist since the days of Rubens. To fathom the secrets reserved to the fervent adepts of art, to acquire and apply the sublime power of reflecting a page of Divine creation, and giving the Avorld a faithful rendering of it, full of grace or vigour, one must needs have struggled Avith the stern realities of life ; one must have, unconsciously at first, and afterwards knowingly, enjoyed the grand and simple spectacle of nature \u2014 have loved and understood the grand teachings of that won derful guide Avhich absorbs the attention of artists, and imparts peculiar originality to their talent. True, artists live in fields and Avoods ; they are bound to nature by end less mysterious ties ; they feel the sap of spring rising in their veins, and the gloom of autumn brings melancholy to their souls. One does not experience those powerful sensations when observing nature through the artificial and conventional light of mundane life. There is ahvays something simple and almost Avild in the natures of great artists. Men whose artistic conviction is truly sincere ahvays remain primitive in certain respects ; a true artist baffles our narrow devices, as would one of the great heroes of Homer. Necessary as such independence is to the ideal conception of art, it is still more so to its material expression. Physical nature hardened by struggle and work is alone fit to endure a life of labour, and to bear the fatigues and excitement of the desperate struggle of the thought with matter, Avhich constitute the daily life of painters and sculptors. The greatest and best of them are those Avho gave birth painfully to their conceptions; Avho, full of anguish, searched their own talent \u2014 Avho hunted up persistently their dream,"], [265, "THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. 249 the impossible dream of perfection, ever foreseen, but never reached or realized. The upper classes are incapable of such persevering and relentless ardour. What I said of them concerning love may be fitly applied in the present case. Their excess of civilization deprives them of the energy required to folloAV up exclusively an idea and devote their life to its pursuit. Their education, family tradition, and peculiar existence forbid their entering on that austere path, and disqualify them to folloAV it. Should an artist placed under those circumstances ever rise to eminence, his case could only be regarded as constituting an anomaly. The members of the aristocracy gain in refinement Avhat they lose in energy. By living according to the narroAv rules of social conventions, their individuality vanishes and becomes gradually powerless to reach a certain develop ment requiring the plenitude of moral and physical qualities. OAving to the artificial conditions of their life, they lack the energy and power of endurance which, it seems, keep up and increase the higher virtues of the soul. The mind of the aristocracy may be likened to an instrument the upper keys of Avhich still give perfect notes, Avhereas the loAver are out of tune. That comparison may serve to explain that, Avhereas mundane circles are unfavourable to the pro duction of painters or sculptors, they are quite suitable to the training of great writers. Before the diffusion of knoAvledge, the upper classes enjoyed the almost exclusive monopoly of supplying France with thinkers, poets, and prose-writers. Even to the pre sent day, although the intellectual current has extended to the lower classes, the aristocracy is still represented by men Avorthy of being reckoned amongst the most famous Avriters. The French upper classes may be justly proud of having given rise to writers Avhose talent would have sufficed to cast lustre on plebeian names. Foremost amongst such"], [266, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 250 writers I must mention the Comte Eugene-Melchior de Vogue, whose clever pen is that of a scholar and of a poet. He does not speak the language of the Muses, but his prose possesses the keen charm and the descriptive power which only belongs to poetry. He had the good fortune of cultivating Russian literature, and soon appre ciated its vast and unknown treasures. He Avas the first to understand that the influence of the new school would be to introduce deep modifications in the direction of modern intellect. He was the first to notice the moral wonders that were taking place beyond the Vistula ; and the works of Russian novelists, which his thorough knowledge of the language enabled him to appreciate, seemed to him the starting-point of a renovation in art, entering on a new and fertile path. He acquainted with Tolstoi and Dostoiewski the genera tion of his countrymen Avho failed to understand Turgenew, and did not even suspect the existence of Gogol and Pouchkine. Thanks to him and to the masters of Russian literature, French contemporary literature is being com pletely renovated. The latter only finds in the former the sincere observation of real life, resulting from the means of investigation furnished by experimental science, and controlled by the pure and sound moral of the Gospel. The little book Avhich fell from heaven, nearly two thou sand years ago, contains all the teachings and all the comforts Avhich cast such pure light on all the characters of the novels of Tolstoi and Dostoiewski, from the poAverful nobleman to the Nihilist student. Many of the Avorks of Russian authors seem written in the margin of the text of Saint John. I felt that impression specially when reading the two masterpieces entitled ' In Quest of Happiness' and ' Recollections from the House of the Dead.' M. de Vogue\" thus made Russian literature known in France; he became the apostle of Russian genius amongst his countrymen, and he benefited by his revelation.

The sincerity of his judgments and descriptions constitutes the happy privilege of a youthful thought. Finally, and that is the characteristic of his French origin, he possesses the gift of rendering his brilliant inspira tions in clear, easy, and correct style, the broad sentences of which charm the ear by their harmonious fluency, Avhile they satisfy reason by the logical connection of their deductions. Such is the masterly talent possessed by M. de Vogue, that the public, that OAves him so many intellectual satis factions, would not have regarded a little pedantry on his part as out of place. He was entitled to speak ex cathedra, and to enforce his lofty views on his readers. He might, if he had pleased, have ministered blame or praise, and passed an opinion on all neAV works. That mission did not tempt him, and I fully understand why. The least things will divert the attention of ladies : the new bonnets are so lovely, the day's gossip is of such absorbing interest. It is, therefore, not very inviting to have patiently polished a sentence, and given clear expression to one's feelings, Avhen, in ten cases out of twelve, a SAveet voice Avill put in a pro voking ' How delightful 1 What did he say ?' M. de Vogue* did not run the risk of such disappoint ments ; his intellectual life is to him the source of too much enjoyment, the compass of his mind is too broad to stoop to become the literary adviser ofhis mundane readers. His chief object is, therefore, to cultivate art, to gratify the taste of his aristocratic readers being only of accessory importance to him. He does his Avork conscientiously, is passionately fond of the perfection of form, and acquires more and more of that serenity of thought Avhich is the"], [268, "252 SOCIETY IN PARIS. characteristic of strong minds. He is the devoted servant of the austere muse to Avhich he is indebted for his lofty in spirations, and only seeks in the salons of the upper classes to relieve his mind from the application required by con stant work. He writes for a select few \u2014 that is, as far as the appreciation of his literary merits is concerned \u2014 and never delivers any of his productions before having imparted to his patiently- matured and skilfully-connected thoughts a marvellously-Avrought and ornate form. His Avorks do not display the least trace of neglect. I understand his artistic scruples and conscientiousness, and quite approve of his contempt for blustering success, so much sought for*, alas ! noAvadays. The comparatively enlightened public noAV shares some of the vulgar apprecia tions of the crowd, and that constitutes a fact most dis tressing to anyone indulging in literary pursuits. Q xl O O %J i. To gratify the taste of the public is a very thankless task. The most exquisite productions too often meet with utter indifference, and fame only comes to their authors Avhen they are laid in their graves ; on the other hand, it is not rare to see a man of inferior talent taken up and extolled by the ignorant multitude, as it sometimes happened that the first work of a Avriter made his reputation, and that the judgment of his contemporaries was ratified by posterity. The Avisest plan to follow is, therefore, to work conscien tiously, and put the best of one's talent in one's productions, whilst paying no attention to the indifference or infatuation they may arouse in the public. The so-called enlightened public is a white elephant very hard to please, enjoying as readily trash as a masterpiece, always making mistakes, getting infatuated with some idiotic nonsense, and displaying the greatest indignation at having been deceived. It is in turn coarse and refined, affecting excessive modesty or brutal cynicism ; its taste is changing and Avhimsical, it is subject to morbid curiosity followed by extravagant sentimentality \u2014 in short, its literary"], [269, "THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. 253 \u00e6sthetics are most fanciful. It will, according to the time, the state of the Aveather, or the mood it feels in, act Don Quixote or Joseph Prud'homme,* and one may consider one's self lucky to please it. It is a shark for appetite, and a regular Proteus as regards its transformations, and the only steady feature in that changeable character is that its judgment is about as clear as that of a fool. Certain authors aimed, hoAvever, at pleasing the en lightened public, and specially that of the upper classes, and succeeded in securing for their productions the large custom of Avealthy French and foreign idlers avIio read French, Avhich, therefore, proves that the thing is not altogether impossible. But, in order to succeed, authors must previously ascer tain carefully how desperately stupid, how always afraid of committing itself, how respectful of good manners and full of aimless curiosity, the public of the upper classes is. To please it one must, at the same time, amuse, excite, affect, and respect it. The great art consists in addressing one's readers as though they were in reality such as they Avish to appear. Authors must treat them to some skilful and harmless dilution of true feelings, to an artificial vieAv of nature, to theories easy to remember and likely to do honour to those Avho profess them. They must write books AA'hich a lady may confess to have read, enjoyed, and understood ; of Avhich she may speak, praising the style in Avhich they are written, and the feelings expressed in them, Avith the con viction that people will exclaim behind her : ' What a delicate soul ! what an honest nature ! what a lofty character !

Feuillet, M. Caro, and a few privileged writers, but that is an accessory consideration. Whatever may be the genius of a modern writer, he will never be forgiven should he fail to express proper feelings in accepted language. I will even go further, and assert that very middling authors are allowed more latitude of thought than their more gifted confreres. A writer is permitted to express in poor language rather suspicious theories, because his incorrect style and the worthlessness of his work give an impression of inefficiency which may be taken for re serve. The novels of Madame Craven are specimens of the works read and enjoyed by the upper classes. Every one of them is hailed Avith joy on publication. The young lady of quality gets it from her bookseller, and the daughter of her dressmaker folloAvs her example. Those mystic and sentimental novels depict love as a godly thing, and social proprieties as praiseworthy, and teach people that the salons of society lead straight to salvation. If I were a father I should, my young friend, forbid my daughter to read them, for fear of discovering love-letters in her Prayer-book. Yet such books are the source of valuable teachings to a critical mind. They give the exact moral stamp of the public for which they are written. They suggest the idea of pretty Avomen and refined gentlemen lightly crossing the lobby of a church, transformed into a mundane meeting-place, where the smell of incense is mingled Avith that of fashionable scents, and devoutly crossing themselves Avhilst talking dis creetly of the news of the day and of nice little scandals. The members of that congregation are neat, elegant, pleasant, and display great piety. They are, nevertheless, very anxious to gratify their little vanity, and enjoy material comfort. Besides, they Avish to feel that they are"], [271, "THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. 255 in the right path to heaven, but each of them has some vague idea that the best way to go there is to imitate the ugly defects of his contemporaries, rather than display his own noble virtues. It is fashionable to affect a polite indifference, outwardly full of sympathy, towards the trials of life which may befall others ; as to heart-troubles or money- losses, the upper classes consider it beneath their dignity to notice them. In cases of more serious troubles, the only comfort their victims get consists in being advised to cheer up and bear them courageously. Yet it is worthy of remark that every body in society complains loudly of whatever misfortune may befall him ; but then, it must be borne in mind that the troubles of people of rank and quality are very different \u2014 in their OAvn eyes \u2014 from the paltry miseries of common folk. The upper classes dread the spread of neAV ideas, and the invasion of broader and more liberal opinions, as much as one does a draught. As a result of that instinctive repugnance, as also of their imperative habit of spending their time in trifles, the persons belonging to that select public do not possess any literary education. Their ignorance of the great masterpieces of literature is truly amazing. That ignorance is, however, more striking Avith people above forty years of age, and especially amongst women. The mothers and grandmothers of the present generation of French ladies Avere more accomplished mondaines ; they had more studied the art of good-breeding, but their intellects had been developed by contact with intellectual men, and by the experience of life, not by studying books. Many a daughter of those charming Avomen, although she may have lost some of the secrets of the tradition of good company, thinks more, and displays better judg ment, in criticising the Avorks she reads. The ladies of the present generation have more intellectual Avants, and possess"], [272, "256 SOCIETY IN PARIS. better means of supplying them. As a proof of that, I may mention that the term 'blue-stocking' is no longer employed in society. But although the intellectual level of the upper classes is raised individually, collectively it has not improved. ' Keep your life secret,' a sage is reported to have said, and that is a precept Avhich should be observed by persons Avho are ever so little above the average by the qualities of the mind. Is it the belief of that fact that so Aveighed on the life of the young Comte Robert de Montesquieu as to cause his shoulders to stoop, and to have imparted such pale complexion to his face, and spread a cast of melancholy over his youth ? I do not think so. The Avorld is indulgent to people Avho amuse it ; eccentricities of any kind are neAV and sometimes entertaining, and I am greatly mistaken if that young apostle of the new school, that Fortunio deliquescent, did not find society compassionate to him. He seems to think that every realized dream, every ascer tained truth, is an offence to some sort of ideal. M. de Montesquieu is passionately fond of everything modern, he is a fanatic admirer of Baudelaire,* and a fervent devotee of a hypercritical poet, whom he regards as the pride of contemporary literature. FeAV persons are, however, acquainted with the productions of that poet, Avhose glory only shines in a limited circle of superior minds, worthy of appreciating his exceptional merits. He has so much concern for the perfection of his art that he is said to devote a whole year to composing a single sonnet, and to spend a month over a hemistich, and a week over the choice of a single epithet. Life is thus too short to enable him to bring to light a work of any ordinary length ; but a &av pages can win glory and fame, and tAvo or three * Pierre Charles Baudelaire, the famous author of ' Les Fleurs du Mai ;' he is also the author of the best French translation of Edgar Poe's works, whose weird talent seems so akin to his own."], [273, "THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. 257 hundred lines will hand clown to posterity the name of Stephane Malldrine. M. de Montesquieu does his best to imitate the master he admires, Avho dwells in the topmost regions of modern Parnassus. He also Avrites some nice little bits of poetry, for which he disdains the fuss of publication, and copies of Avhich, Avritten in black letters on vellum, are circulated in select circles. The noble poet introduces cleverly, in his productions, the adjectives invented by his eminent master. Competent persons consider those adjectives as very telling ; they reproduce from life the acuteness of a sensation, so it seems, and make it pass like a shiver through the minds of the select feAV Avho have attained the degree of refinement, required to relish the lovely insipidity cf the language of the ddiquescents* The eccentricities of M. de Montesquieu are not confined to literature.

The oddities of the melancholy hero of that book are not calculated to Avin for him the sympathy of readers. If the picture is faithful, there is little doubt that D'Artagnan would disown his nephew in the original of the sad character of Des Esseintes. One might then wish, for the sake of the future French aristocracy, that the old land of Gaul might be once more invaded by some barbarians, in order to put some new and vigorous blood into the veins of its descendants. It would, however, be a great mistake to think that the * A term applied to the newest school of Frerch literature, iu order to characterize it. t Huysmans (a contemporary Belgian writer). t ' Against the Grain.' 17"], [274, "258 SOCIETY IN PARIS. indulgence of the upper classes towards M. de Montesquieu signifies their unconditional approval of all similar cases. They sympathize Avith that young nobleman for being afflicted Avith a gibbous intellect, but it does not follow that they like all the men Avho suffer from similar trouble. There are in the aristocracy some lively and sound minds, Avhose productions possess personal attraction, inasmuch as, dealing Avith historical questions, they have nothing to do with the problems which arouse the suspicions of the timid judgment of the members of the upper classes. Amongst those noble historians I may mention the Marquis de Costa and the Comte de Ludre. Under the title of ' Un homme d'autrefois,'* the former sketched, for the edification of his contemporaries, the sympathetic character of his grandfather. To the Comte de Ludre French literature is indebted for a capital history of the English Court under the four Georges. The work of the Marquis de Costa is very interesting ; it throAvs great light on the rise of the patriotic feelings Avhich led to the unity of Italy. It is written in sober style, and displays skill and intelligence in the choice of documents. Altogether, the general excellence of that Avork is such that one can only Avish every family of the French aristocracy to produce a Avriter capable of raising such a monument to the glory of his house. Many families possess records of sufficient interest to supply the necessary materials for similar publications, and it is most desirable that young scholars should devote their leisure to Avorking those rich mines of information. Every one of us would be delighted at the prospect of being drawn, by a grandson as learned as the Marquis de Costa, in a portrait as attractive as that of the friend of Joseph de Maistre. The Comte de Ludre is still a young man, of sprightly mind and remarkably enlightened literary taste. He was one of the warmest supporters of the Legitimist Party, and * ' A Man of the Past.'"], [275, "THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. 259 noAV shares the political vieAvs of the Comte de Mun, his nephew, although he displays intelligent moderation in practising the principles of the fiery apostle of uncompro mising Catholics. I am, nevertheless, inclined to think that his convictions are just as Avarm, and that, should occasion offer, he would clearly manifest them ; for my great knoAvledge of men has taught me that the soundest judgments are generally those of moderate minds. The Comte de Baillon is a scholar very expert in matters of taste. He is the author of a most interesting essay on the daughter of Henry IV., afterwards the Avife of Charles I. His lovely residence on the Quai d'Orsay contains art treasures patiently collected and selected Avith a minute care that illustrates his Avonderful knowledge of the times he likes most \u2014 those of the Regency. His bronzes, pictures, and china are perfect specimens of their kind. M. de Baillon devotes much of his time to historical inquiries, and his publications are much appreciated by the public. He is kind and amiable ; although his mind is lively and someAvhat sarcastic, he never makes use of it at the expense of anybody. He enjoys his happy old age in the company of the Baronne de Gartempe and the Comtesse de Costa, his charming niece and grand-niece, and devotes all the energy he still possesses to artistic and literary pursuits, cheered by the affection of his relatives. In this he is considerably better off than the sage of Horace. I have already called your attention, my dear friend, to the fact that the upper classes treat very severely intellectual productions dealing Avith ideas and feelings, and display narrow and prejudiced views Avhen judging them. Much to my grief, truth compels me to add that the ostracism applied to the Avorks also extends to their authors. There reigns in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a certain dislike to receiving artists or writers. The inmates of its noble mansions quote the following words of a nobleman : 17\u20142"], [276, "260 SOCIETY IN PARIS. ' Protect art, but never artists ;' and they accordingly shut the doors of their wealthy residences against anyone Avho has raised himself by his talent and is only indebted to himself for fame. A few salons are alone open to fashionable authors, although in the majority of cases their noble hosts lay special stress on the fact of their being received as personal friends, and the homage to which their talent entitles them is confined to some trifling and insignificant compliments. They would almost be requested to leave their reputation with their coats in the cloak-room. A new Avork never sees the light in the salons of the aristocracy, the mistresses of houses fearing thereby to give to their parties the appearance of literary meetings. That prejudice proceeds from two causes, the first being that the salons of the upper classes were, until the beginning of the present century, the centre of intellectual activity. That centre has been removed, and is now to be found in democratic circles ; hence a certain secret rancour, a spite which manifests itself in apparent scorn. They will even go so far as to expel from their circle, and treat as enemies, those of their class who deserted them and became independent. The second cause of that prejudice is the groAving trespass of reporting into the private life of the upper classes. Occasionally, a nobleman may be pleased to read in the morning paper the description of the dress worn by his wife at the ball of the previous night ; but the great majority of the members of the aristocracy dislike the intrusive indiscretion of the public. They think it hateful that the most minute incidents of one's private life should thus be given in pasture to the most vulgar, insipid, and ridiculous curiosity that ever Avas. The columns devoted to social gossip in three of the leading Paris papers are the exact reproduction of the same events related in exactly the same words. The four corners of Europe are thus"], [277, "THE LITERATURE OF THE UPPER CLASSES. 261 acquainted Avith the sham account of a conventional society, all the particulars of Avhich Avere invented in the editor's room, and never happened but in his brain, although they are, in the main, based on the information obtained from the secretaries, tutors, and steAvards of tbe great families. A feAV Avaifs of society, unlucky gamblers and ruined club men, also follow that profession of sham reporters \u2014 a not very remunerative one, it appears ; and the series of sham reports proceeding from those suspicious sources is a cause of constant irritation for the members of the upper classes, Avho are thus induced to confuse reporters with journalists. The mistake is great, no doubt, but excusable. The press is noAV the only field open to the manifestation of young talent. The leading contemporary writers do not think it beneath them to enter that field occasionally, and the prose of obscure scribblers is indifferently mixed up Avith that of the masters of the day. That confusion gives rise to the feelings of distrust which form the greater part of the opposition offered to the spread of neAV ideas Avhich constitutes the chief characteristic of the intellectual life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. It is, therefore, very rare to meet any author, however famous, in the salons of the left bank of the Seine. But Avhenever it Avas my luck to meet one, I felt much amused, my young friend, to notice the childish curiosity, mingled with suspicion, with which the personage Avas received. It put me in mind of the hero of tbe ' Lettres Persanes '* strolling about Long champs in European clothes.

Hoav can anyone be a Persian ?' * Montesquieu."], [278, "262 SOCIETY IN PARIS. TENTH LETTER. LIFE IN PARIS. The legends current amongst the middle classes, and the descriptions one reads in novels concerning the life led by the so-called fortunate members of the upper classes, are very far from actual truth. That life is similar, in many respects, to that followed by the Avealthy idlers of all classes of society, with the sole difference that the laAvs of propriety, the traditions of each family, and social obligations, limit individual freedom of action, more especially as regards moral rather than material life. The community of interests and the spirit of caste are so strong amongst the members of the upper classes, that whatever happens to one of them seems to concern them all, even though that person should be an utter stranger. Certain persons consider as a kind of sacerdoce the privilege of belonging to society, either by birth or by mar riage ; they accept it Avith perfect earnestness, and discharge its duties most minutely, and Avith a thorough belief in their importance. There are ladies, and even gentlemen, although the stronger sex is less inclined to do so than the other, who are ever playing the part of pontiffs of social rules, and spend their whole life in deciding fastidious questions of propriety, and in elaborating the traditional code of good-breeding. All the members of the upper classes, fortunately, do not take so much to heart their mission of representatives of a polite society, and do not allow themselves to be thus tyrannized over bjr public opinion. As a matter of fact, Paris is, of all cities, that where one enjoys the most complete liberty. Its society is so numerous, the upper classes are there"], [279, "LIFE IN PARIS. 263 surrounded by so many circles with Avhich they are closely connected, the different coteries are so thoroughly related to each other, that everybody may manage his time as he pleases, and, by the outAvard observance of a feAV rules far less numerous than one Avould think, it is easy to give free course to one's private tastes. Novelty, the goddess who rules over the destinies of the intellectual life of Paris, despises to-day Avhat Avas yesterday her favourite food. Being accustomed to live in that changing current of opinion, the Parisians are not surprised at anything ; their infatuation seldom lasts beyond a day, and with them you are scarcely noticed before you are already forgotten. Under those circumstances it is, therefore, easy to live as one likes best ; but, as a rule, the life of the upper classes is very uniform. A young bachelor, anxious to play the part of Don Juan, depends for success on the skill of his tailor, his own mastery of the jargon of the day, and the seduction of disappointment, Avhich, in fact, constitutes his most favourite affectation ; he gets up late, devises some style of dress in Avhich morning ease is toned doAArn by English correctness, and rides to the Bois de Boulogne on a meek and reliable little horse. On the road, he thinks hoAv irresistible he must look in his Spanish-leather boots ; and on perceiving in the distance the fair lady of his dreams, avIio, surrounded by a regular crowd of admirers, rides along the Allt'e des Poteaux, dealing out smiles Avith skilful reserve, he raises his elboAvs in the most graceful Avay. There is a spot in the Bois de Boulogne Avhere the riders' walk crosses the Allee des Acacias : that privileged corner has received the name of La Potiniere.* It is the place Avhere people avIio take their morning drive generally stop to chat with the early devotees of equestrian or pedestrian sport.

They speak of the weather, of the last ball, or of the latest news. People Avho respect themselves consider it a matter of great importance to go regularly to La Potiniere. The fact of ceasing to frequent it constitutes marked progress in the path of austerity : by giving up going to the daily meeting of people versed in the art of spending cheerfully the excessive power of their muscles, or gratifying in a harmless way their inordinate thirst of affection, one con siders that one's youth is over, and ranks Avith people of ripe age. Amongst the regular visitors to La Potiniere may be seen the pretty Comtesse de Saint-Roman, Avith her golden hair, roguish mouth, and open and Avaggish face. She is always ready to laugh, and her laughter reminds people of that of Samary ;* her young and fresh voice sounds like the echo of ber kind and simple nature, and the frankness of her appreciations and her communicative gaiet}** possess Avonderful charm. A little farther may also be seen at that fashionable meeting-place the Prince de Sagan, the Marquis de Modene, and the Baron d'Helie, three fervent adepts of pedestrianism. The Prince de Sagan is fifty years of age, and, notwith standing his hoary locks, still dresses ivith the utmost elegance. He seems to regard the art of dress as a kind of civic virtue, as likely to lead to all honours. He is the high priest of fashion, the Alcibiades of modern times, the inventor of Auteuil races, and the oracle of the club of the Rue Royale. At any rate, he is a reliable and devoted friend, and a refined and sensible gentleman. The Marquis de Modene is the greatest biases of the time. He is a veteran of love's battles, and still keeps alive the sweet recollection of bygone days, which sometimes still awakes in him his slumbering passions. When his friends * A lovely French actress."], [281, "LIFE IN PARIS. 265 v give vent to their surprise and express their admiration for his green old age, ' One cannot ahvays be getting old,' humorously puts in the amiable Marquis, Avith the SAveet and guileless smile familiar to him. The Baron d'Helie is a Southerner. That supreme leader of Parisian fashion Avas born close to Narbonne. He is a fanatic sportsman, a regular attendant of the meetings of the committee of races, and a confirmed bachelor, devoting his life to the interests of the turf and the affection of his friends. For him Paris is confined to his club, and the country to Longchamps race-course. He is sensible and full of tact and kindness ; he is most fashionable in his dress, and the gray hat Avhich he dons at the first spring meeting of the Bois de Boulogne bears the stamp of the most supreme Parisian elegance. The Due de Morny rides to La Potiniere on a big chest nut horse. His lovely Avife, driving a pair of fine black ponies, meets him there at the appointed time. She has splendid eyes, a rather exotic grace, and a very fascinating smile ; Avhen she shall be accustomed to her neAV life, every body will say, I am sure, that Venezuela could not have sent a more pretty flower to the Old World, and that Paris society can only congratulate itself on possessing such a charming member. Amongst the young married ladies avIio practise Avalking, so much recommended by Tronchin* to their lovely grand mothers, Avhom they rival in that respect, I may mention Mesdames de Pracomtal, de Kergarion, de Salignac-Fenelon, and de Chevigne.

Her dark -blue eyes are bright and intelligent ; they look very sweet, but can doubtless assume a severe expression Avhen she likes. She has a warm and Avhite complexion, and her Spanish features bear Avitness to the Flemish origin of her family. Madame de Salignac-Fe'nelon possesses exquisitely fine features ; and the lovely boy, fully six years old, avIio accom panies her Avith a manly air of protection, is the very portrait of his lovely mother. That lady, Avho bears the great name of the author of ' Te'femaque,'* is very intelli gent and cultured, and devotes the best of her time to the education of her many children. Intellectual pursuits have great attraction for her, and out of duty she affects to regard Avith indifference the pleasures of her age. Her eyes have a very SAveet expression. She is a sensible Eucharis, Avho would have driven to despair the son of Ulysses, but never caused any uneasiness to Calypso. With her classical profile, her fine blue eyes, and her guileless grace, the Comtesse de Chevigne' is one of the most lovely Avomen in Paris society, all the members of Avhich are unanimous in acknowledging her irresistible spell. She is the descendant of the chaste lady-love of Petrarch, and, like her lovely ancestor, her frank and SAveet look is full of poetic expression. M. de la Haye-Jousselin always rides a superb black horse. He is a most correct gentleman, and the only fault of his ancestors is that they never went to the Crusades ; but he fully makes up for that draAvback by the care Avith which he selects his friends amongst people of the highest quality.

Mr. Ridgway is blessed with nonchalance of mind, and a flash of satisfaction may be noticed in his heedless eyes. The recollection of former joys and the sweet certainty of future pleasure seem to cheer his natural placidity. If he acquainted us with what he thinks, Ave should feel doubtless interested ; but that is a trouble he has not yet taken. His intellectual life is a deep mystery. The green Avoods, the early song of birds, the sap of spring rising in young shoots \u2014 all those sights of the revival of nature may per haps possess some delightful meaning for him. I am very much mistaken if Mr. Ridgway is not one of the men cursed by poets, and for whom Nature would have no attraction unless enlivened by the presence of petticoats. But it is now time to return to Paris. On my Avay home I meet the Comtesse de Biencourt driving her own little trap. Everybody knows that lady artist, whose lovely hotel in the Rue Yernet is a regular museum filled Avith remark able works due to her chisel. Being possessed of a rare intellect and of remarkable aptitudes, the Countess made a special study of the art of ornament. The sconces, candle sticks, and clock-cases wrought by her can compare Avith the productions of the most famous art-workers of the eighteenth century. She rivals Gouthiere and Riesener, and might undoubtedly have secured a much higher ambi tion. But she has attained such excellence in her special department that nobody needs complain of her having made such a modest choice. Friendly visits are generally paid during the hour imme diately folloAving lunch. People must be urged by some great attraction to call thus, with the certainty of finding the master of the house' smoking his cigar after a meal, and his wife finishing some tapestry-work not quite so symbolical as that of Penelope, or tormenting some harm-"], [284, "268 SOCIETY IN PARIS. less wool with a little hook. Of course, the babes are indulging in primitive gymnastics on the carpet. That is a moment of lull in daily activity; and the friendly visitor Avho calls then is very welcome, especially if he brings the news of the day, a criticism of Lady So-and-so's dress, an invitation to some private dinner at the club of the Rue Royale, or the rough scheme of an excursion to the country. At three o'clock carriages are ordered. Ladies put on their visiting dresses in order to leave in a dozen draAving rooms the sweet scent of violet that perfumes their pretty persons, to display the latest novelty in the boundless pro vince of feminine dress, and the exquisite charm of their lovely chatter. It is noAV the growing fashion to pay visits only on appointed days and times. The commonplace visiting-cards are distributed by a servant ; and from the first day of January until the last day of April hundreds of those little paper squares are delivered by some faithful hand at the various residences of the upper classes. People do not now see so many aristocratic carriages stopping at every door in the Rue de Grenelle, the Rue de Yarenne, and the Faubourg Saint-Honore, and a small gloved hand giving a card to the footman. That heavy and irksome labour is now much more easily performed. Young married ladies now confine themselves to calling only where they are certain to find people at home. They sit awhile by the side of the armchair of some aged relation, who scarcely leaves her apartments, and welcomes with joy and gratitude the Avhiff of out-door fresh air brought in the rustling dress of the lovely niece or grand-daughter. They call on a lady friend obliged to keep her room by her interesting condition ; be sides, they attend all the ' at-honies ' and parties of society. Afternoon calls are, as a rule, not very entertaining. It is rather fastidious and formal to receive \\risitors from three to seven p.m. ; and it always struck me that mistresses of"], [285, "LIFE IN PARIS. 269 houses must display more art in their conversation Avith, and make themselves more agreeable generally toAvards, day- visitors than they need do toAvards the guests of their evening parties. As a rule, visitors Avho call at a house in the daytime do not knoAV each other. Groups are therefore formed, and the conversation engaged in is soon broken, seeing that such calls do not, generally, last more than a quarter of an hour. The male element is seldom represented there, except by some country relation, or neighbour from one's country seat ; friends, as a rule, preferring to call at private and familiar hours. To take an unsuspicious nobleman to a circle exclusively composed of ladies is considered as a very nasty trick. Being alone of his sex, he feels quite lost at hearing the gossiping tAvaddle of those pretty and finely dressed chatter boxes. The daily tea-parties, known to French society under the name of ' five-o'clocks,' are more private and select. They gather generally a dozen of faithful and intimate friends round a small table, loaded with the latest English novelties, in matters of kettles, teapots, or apostle tea spoons. The most fashionable tea-parties are those of the Princesse d'Aremberg, of her sister the Comtesse de 1' Aigle, of the Comtesse de Belbeuf, of the Comtesse de Ludre, of the Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild, of the Marquise d'Hervey, and of the Vicomtesse de Broissia. There is a marked contrast betAveen the Comtesse de l'Aigle and the lovely Princesse d'Aremberg, her sister. The former is a lady of tall and handsome figure, but she is more blunt than graceful, and the power of her intellect is greater than the charm of her mind. She is an earnest and serious lady, amiable and lively Avith her intimate friends ; she does not care much for society, and considers"], [286, "270 SOCIETY IN PARIS. more the duties than the pleasures of life. She avails herself of her high situation to do much good, and her charity is quite devoid of ostentation, Avhich adds further value to it. She has a single child \u2014 a son \u2014 whose education takes up the best portion of her time ; but as useful lives are those that leave most leisure, she also finds the neces sary time to acquaint herself with contemporary progress in science, art, and literature. She is a learned lover of books, and rivals the merits of the Comtesse Fernand de la Ferronnays in that special branch of know ledge. She talks about the binding and various editions of a book Avith as much competence as the late Brunet himself, and is thoroughly acquainted Avith the contents of the rare and valuable works comprising her splendid library. The Comtesse de Belbeuf resides in the fine mansion built by the Comtesse Simeon, her mother, on the Quai d'Orsay. She is a kind and amiable lady, in whom the qualities of the mind and of the heart are thoroughly well balanced. Her conversation is serious, Avithout pedantry ; her politeness perfectly natural, and free from affectation, and her tact exquisite. The years have not left their trace on her fine classical face ; her hair is still as fresh and glossy as in youth, her teeth as perfect. Her heart is still young, and the daughters of her friends treat her with a trusty affection just as sincere as that, more familiar, of her contemporaries. When the Comtesse Simeon was alive the hotel of the Quai d'Orsay Avitnessed frequent parties, much frequented by the aristocracy. It is closed since the death of that excellent lady, who did the honours of her home with kindly grace, mingled with the sweet old-fashioned polite ness, the secret of Avhich seemed to consist in forgetting one's self to think but of other people's pleasure. Society Avill doubtless hail Avith joy the reopening of that hospitable mansion."], [287, "LIFE IN PARIS. 271 The Comtesse Hubert de Montesquieu also helped the Comtesse de Belbeuf, her aunt, to do the honours of those salons. She is a pretty and smart lady, possessed of a most peculiar charm, and of a very personal turn of mind. There is in her nature a certain amount of melancholy, toned down by great activity of thought. I am inclined to believe that she carries her investigation of things too far to notice their best side. She is too frank and too honest to feel satisfied Avith the unpleasant little discoveries Avhich are necessarily made by people Avho study and analyze matters too minutely. Wisdom consists in not expecting from this world more than it can give. Democ ritus and Heraclitus seem to me both in the wrong. They take life too much to heart Avho Avish to apply rules to it. We should not laugh, but smile ; Ave should not cry, but merely sigh. The Aveight of years seems lighter to him who, like Candide,* can find comfort in digging his own garden. . . . The tea-parties of the Comtesse de Ludre are also much frequented. That lady is supremely elegant, and her dress maker has very little to do Avith it. It is her matchless and rather peculiar and delicate grace which gives effect to, and sets off, the dresses she wears. She is the daughter of the Prince Charles de Beauvan and of the Comtesse Komar, and inherited the best qualities of her parents. She possesses the eminently French qualities of her father : a sprightly intellect, an exquisite taste, and moderation of mind. She inherits from her mother her rather foreign look and her large pensive eyes, full of all the poetic charm of Northern countries. With her fair hair and Avhite complexion she was, at eighteen, the Nixie of legends \u2014 the mischievous fairy Avith inquisitive and per plexing look, Avhose green eyes reflected the expression of her regular features, seldom enlivened by a smile. The Comte de Ludre, her husband, is quite worthy of * The chief character in Voltaire's famous novel."], [288, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 272 appreciating her fascinating charm. I have already had occasion to mention in this Avork the eminent qualities of that kind and erudite nobleman. The Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denis is a distinguished Oriental scholar and a learned naturalist. He is knoAvn to scholars as the author of numerous papers sent to the various learned French and foreign bodies, and as Professor of Chinese in the College of France. He does not speak much, and very likely possesses great power of observation. His disposition is kind and friendly, but he does not much care for society. His charming wife is, for intellect and beauty, one of the most noted ladies of Parisian society, by which she is very much liked. She is the daughter of Mr. Ward, who managed to become the confidant and friend of the late Duke of Parma. On being married she left Vienna, Avhere she spent the early years of her life. Her brother still resides in Austria, Avhence he comes from time to time to acquaint his sister with the latest news of Viennese society. He is a very pleasant young man, and must doubtless be much appre ciated in the circles to Avhich he belongs. I much re gretted not to meet him in Vienna, and had to Avait until my return to Paris before making his acquaintance. The Marquise d'Hervey is a fair beauty, Avhose cheeks display the most delicate pink. Her exquisite dresses do great credit to the talent of Worth, the famous dressmaker, and none of his other customers ever furnished that master of Parisian elegance Avith such facilities for the display of his abilities. Indeed, nature seems to have bestowed its most graceful attractions on the Marquise d'Hervey. Her figure is slender, and most perfect in its proportions. Her light hair possesses that peculiar shade Avhich agrees with all colours of dress ; all fashions suit her, and each of them seems to impart new charm to her delicate beauty. She is very Avell educated, speaks several languages, and"], [289, "LIFE IN PARIS. 273 expresses herself with great elegance in each of them ; besides, she has a great sense of art, and devotes some of her leisure to painting, and her conversation is as fascinating as her lovely person. She is the most perfect type of what the French novelists of the beginning of this century understood as a 'jolie femme,'* and whose ideal conception still prevails amongst contemporary artists. She seems the original of some of Cabanel's portraits, or the living character of one of Madame Riccoboni's novels. Modern art applies itself to endow each of its personages Avith personal characteristics. I, hoAvever, regret it, I con fess, notwithstanding my admiration for broader reality in art. I liked the pretty heroines of the past, all made on the same pattern, who prompted Arvers'-f sonnet ; who had whims, fancies, and moods, lovely light curls, a wit of their own, and always the same smiles for their admirers. Although they all seemed cast in the same model, and their womanly charm seemed about as true to reality as a dressmaker's picture to a work of art, they possessed the great charm ... of fascinating the heart without engrossing the mind.

Her face sparkles Avith good-humour, her frank looks bear Avitness to her bright and bold intellect, and her mind is as keen and original as her lovely and delicate features. She is a cheerful charmer, a regular nymph with Gavroche's* ways, one of Clodion'sf pictures, Avith all tbe devilry of modern fun. It is entertaining to hear the daring allusions to current gossip on those lovely lips, as perfect as those draAvn by Latour.j Now and then a bold expression that Avould scare elderly matrons enlivens the conversation, much to the delight of a select feAV. Nobody talks like Madame de Broissia. Her very gossip is amusing, being as it is the faithful mirror of her thoughts. Other people hit on a lucky word or expression ; they find subjects Avhich excite their fancy and impart transient attraction to their conversation ; but Avith her, humour is not the exception, and witty remarks follow each other easily and Avithout the least affectation.

One of the greatest mistakes of people is to stop one's progress as soon as one has scored a victory, to consider as lasting Avhatever advantages one may have obtained, and to regard all further efforts as useless and uncalled for. Success in society, as Avell as in the most insignificant sphere of life, belongs to those who never grow tired of Avorking, Avho never lose sight of the fact that there is no limit to the improvement of human nature, and that moral as well as material things are always susceptible of being better and more skilfully managed. Paris society seems to have forgotten that comforting view of life. It seems to have grown tired of its usual pleasures, and to have no longer the spirit of seeking for new ones. Formerly, society met from the beginning of carnival until the end of May. That Avas the only time during which Avell-bred people could think of giving balls and parties to their friends and acquaintances. At any other time their salons ran a great risk of remaining empty. English customs are now prevailing, oAving to the growing taste for sport, and to the spreading fashion of spending the winter in the South. Towards the close of March, Avhen hunting is over, Paris society leaves its chateaux at Cannes or Pau and returns to the capital. Thus, what is termed ' the season ' seldom begins before Lent, and is over in the first fortnight of June, after the running of the Grand Prix. Two or three white balls \u2014 to use the term in general use \u2014 are generally given before the holy time of penance, to the great delight of youth. Married ladies have seldom the opportunity of putting on a ball dress before Easter. During Lent every house has its day at home, sometimes enlivened by a little music. Those ' at homes ' are very 18\u20142"], [292, "276 SOCIETY IN PARIS. dull and formal ; people go to them with the impression of discharging a duty rather than with the prospect of enjoying themselves. It is noAV a growing fashion to go out late, and within the last tAvo years society has felt so cheerless and low-spirited, OAving to the uncertainty of the future in a sense favourable to the wishes of the upper classes, that it is noAV a spreading custom to go home early. Between eleven and tAvelve all the guests defile in one of the salons in order to take leave of their hosts, and come out with catching and unaccountable haste to order their carriages, most of which have hardly had time to reach the stand assigned to them before they must leave it in order to load. But as they are all called together, it takes them a certain time to come up, so that the guests spend the best part of the evening in the Avaiting-rooms. Thus is seen the ludicrous scene of masters dancing attendance in their empty draiving-rooms, and wondering at the prompt disappearance of their guests, Avhom they can hear talking and laughing on the stairs. \u2022 Spring balls and parties last later, although it requires a very large proportion of young ladies amongst the guests to succeed Avith much trouble to make the cotillon last until three o'clock in the morning. Young ladies of the present day are just as cheerful and just as anxious to enjoy themselves as their predecessors, but people noAV seem to have lost the secret of taking pleasure collectively. Society seems to be getting duller every day, and the old French spirit seems considerably weakened amongst the upper classes, and it is a question whether it will ever be revived. That state of decadence is likeAvise noticeable in the art of conversation. There is no doubt that certain circles still enjoy the privilege of gathering brilliant talkers, and of affording their regular visitors the advantage of an attrac tive and Avitty company, but the persons who still enjoy such delicate treats are getting fewer daily."], [293, "LIFE IN PARIS. 277 The various balls and parties where society meets now seem intended to offer old ladies suitable occasions to take a nap, to enable middle-aged gentlemen to Avalk about Avith utter indifference as to Avhat is going on, or to stand sadly in the corners of doors, and to afford young people the pleasant opportunity of engaging in harmless flirtation. The latter is of British importation, and has made considerable progress in French society. Most young French ladies have now become thoroughly conversant with an art which may be described as ' shamming love,' for flirting is nothing else. It is the sham of feelings, the introduction into conversation of the language of passion distorted by modern fun, Avith a tendency to save, by means of hoyden manners and intentional bluntness, what may seem suspicious and incorrect in the game. There can be little doubt that that innovation will foster a certain boldness of language, and that the former tradition of reserve current amongst the ladies of society will, to some extent, suffer by it. But that invasion of English manners has, in other respects, simply developed Avhat existed already. Thus it confirmed the natural vulgarity of certain natures, and the random use of the terms of a special gibberish only replaced that of locution employed Avith just as little judgment. Delicate and refined natures, whilst following to some extent the new fashion, display, nevertheless, a certain choice in their expressions; they know Avhich* to employ and which to reject, and still preserve good taste, that appanage of well-bred people. Therefore, I neither deplore nor blame the neAV fashion of acting. I have often said so in society, and am quite ready to maintain my view on that subject. Passing infatuation for a language borrowed from stables or sport, and the efforts made nowadays [to impart less restraint to the manners of the upper classes, Avill fail to"], [294, "278 SOCIETY IN PARIS. alter the rules adopted by good company. At all times people got infatuated with one thing or another, but that soon passed aAvay. French society will keep up its old reputation ; it Avill continue to be the sanctum of good breeding, of politeness, and of elegant manners, provided the tradition of the good education of girls be maintained Avith sufficient care. Of that education I have spoken already at great length, and need not dwell on it any more. I am thoroughly convinced that so long as ladies of quality will be found to perpetuate the type I have endeavoured to sketch, they will know how to keep their immediate circle to the level of their intel lectual and moral character. People will speak to them the language they understand ; they will call forth in others feelings in keeping with the delicate aspirations of their feminine hearts ; they will suggest heroism and raise men's courage. The respect of woman is alive in all classes of French society. I am happy to notice it, for is not the future generation \u2014 the advent of which I sincerely hope, for the sake of France \u2014 to be brought up in the laps of women ? Besides the ordinary occupations of daily life, rides, drives, afternoon and evening calls, the life of the upper classes comprises certain duties with which I must, my dear friend, acquaint you. Formerly, some grand ball Avas given every week during the season. In ' Cherie,'* M. de Goncourt has made a very faithful picture of Avhat was the life of society towards the close of the Empire. A lull took place in the tAvo first years that folloAved the war, but the spring of 1873 contrasted favourably Avith the memorable year of the Exhibition,-f and during the five or six years that followed the devotees of mundane pleasures could hardly complain of the Avant of occasion to gratify their favourite passion. Now, as already remarked, times are very much altered : * ' Darling.' f Of 1867."], [295, "LIFE IN PARIS. 279 1886 Avas a perfect disaster with respect to mundane life, and 1887 does not seem likely to improvTe the situation. I am quite affected when I think of the distress of my lovely little friends. I have watched them very closely, and I may confess that few studies ever seemed to me as in teresting as the observation of the various effects produced by Avorldly vanities on the intricate nature of women. I have made many remarks in that respect, and should be glad, my dear friend, to see you test their accuracy with the tact and discernment which form the basis of your character. A young lady makes her first appearance in society, she gets married, and three or four years afterwards she is in full possession of the position she is to occupy ; she sometimes needs a longer time to reveal herself and con quer the place she truly deserves. But a lady seldom reaches twenty-five Avithout having given a fair sample of her worth and furnished her contemporaries Avith the neces sary means for passing an opinion on her merits. The chief condition for obtaining a favourable judgment is to have been born and brought up in the circle in Avhich she is called upon to live. It is a fact Avorthy of quoting that foreigners and the daughters of the middle classes get far more easily accustomed to the life and manners of the upper classes than the daughters of the French aristocracy brought up away from Paris, either in their families or in the school of some chief j)rovincial tOAvn. The delightful little heroine of M. Hale'vy* will make a very attractive ' Princess.' Some American or English ladies have become the most charming women of Parisian society. Some Avomen of plebeian birth become perfect ladies. But provincials never could overcome the dis advantages they labour under. That is due to the fact that * M. Ludovic Haiti vy, member of the Academie Francaise, and a gifted dramatist and novelist. One of his last novels is entitled ' Princesse.'"], [296, "280 SOCIETY IN PARIS. in France every social circle has manners and usages of its OAvn. The chief towns of the various departments have each their OAvn ' society,' more jealously closed against intruders than anywhere else in the world. Society in Poitiers or in Rennes does not hold the same views as society in Bordeaux or in Montpellier. Every one of those towns contains four or five very distinct social circles, the chief pre-occupation of the members of which is to keep up their OAvn level and to crush people whom they con sider as beneath them, the natural consequence of that state of things being that everybody considers as para mount the safeguarding of his own dignity, and that the importance of the parts played is plainly out of proportion with that of the centres where those ambitions and in terests are debated. It is necessary to have lived in a French provincial town to appreciate the degree of moral and intellectual ankylosis of which some people are still susceptible in this century of light and progress. Parents infatuated with silly class and rank prejudices do not suspect the terrible injury Avhich their teachings will cause to the young brains of their children. It is not generally known how far the defect of stopping at vain considerations of self-conceit and pursuing the silly satis faction of pride will debase the mind and limit the horizon of one's thoughts. The minds of children brought up by people tainted with those mean and narrow views is irremediably contaminated as regards the life of society. They Avill nevrer be able to confront its difficulties Avith the ease and simplicity Avhich are the only required and efficacious means of success. ' Do you really think you are going to cause a sensation ?' said an old Ambassador, rather surly but full of good sense, to a young attache' who alleged his timidity as an excuse for delaying making his appearance in the society of his new post. In like manner, the young beauty from Nantes,"], [297, "LIFE IN PARIS. 281 Lille, or Rheims, will never lay aside the unfortunate opinion that her most insignificant acts or words are of the utmost importance. She will think that people watch her steps, notice her degree of amiableness, and reckon her smiles. She Avill play her part in thorough earnest, assume a much more theatrical appearance than is becoming, and, after making her deLmt in society at the age of eighteen, she will continue to do so all her life, and when old age comes, she becomes a melancholy misanthrope or an excessive pietist, as a natural result of the many deceptions to which she has been subjected. The secret of succeeding in society consists in attaching no importance to success, and in displaying self-abnegation and the utmost simplicity in the discharge of social duties. One must appear such as one is in reality, though shoAv ing much reserve concerning whatever exceptional gifts one may possess. That programme is never so well folloAved as by ladies who have been all their life on intimate terms Avith those whom they are called upon to visit. That remark also applies to men, although to a lesser degree. The part of women requires a more refined know- ledge of the minute things of current life, whereas the exciting and broader field of male activity prevents men from preserving irremediably the stamp of the social circles in Avhich they were brought up. I flatter myself, my young friend, that after observing a lady for ten minutes I Avill tell you Avhether she is a provincial. Her voice, the tone of it, and even her gait, will betray her. I can also detect the middle-class origin of a lady, but the distinction is in that case much more difficult to notice. I do not intend, dear friend, to acquaint you Avith all the secrets I know, but the following will enable you to judge hoAv deeply I have studied those nice shades. The provincial lady casts anxious looks about her, and"], [298, "282 SOCIETY IN PARIS. ahvays fancies that people talk of her when whispering near her. Doubt is always expressed on her face. She does not enjoy a joke, and the harmless jest, consisting in double entendre, frightens her to death. A lady of humble birth, but brought up in Paris, is quite free from such eccentricity of character ; she will conceal her ignorance of the manners of society under the veil of modest timidity, and, if intelligent, she will soon learn thoroughly how to play her part. For her, the difficulty Avill rather consist in Avhat I may term the technical part of her duties. Thus, she will seldom know how to dress herself. A lady of quality, in full dress, generally bares her shoulders, as is meet ; her dress is neither too Ioav nor too high. The dresses of ladies of provincial or middle-class birth are generally too high, and in some rare cases outrageously too low. Ladies of birth and education are so accustomed to dress that they know exactly Avhat to wear. But a lady who Avears a low dress for the first time is dreadfully alarmed and perplexed ; she feels either over scrupulous or altogether indifferent to what people may say or think. The daughters of dukes, of petty noblemen, and of mer chants, are equal in one single respect. I never met anywhere, and in any class, any lady that did not think that she was indebted to her dress for the best of her charms. When, humble and trembling and overAvhelmed Avith the grief of her fault, our mother Eve hid her naked ness Avith leaves, she must have looked at herself in the Avater of some spring in order to arrange gracefully her verdant veil, and, five thousand years after, that pre occupation still engrosses the minds of her daughters. Madame de Maintenon herself, that paragon of judgment and Avisdom, that broad and well-balanced mind, could not resist that failing. It is reported that she cried out of humiliation because her dress was too short."], [299, "LIFE IN PARIS. 283 A strange feeling of modesty will lead every woman to ascribe her successes to her dress, especially if the effect produced is due to the novelty of the dress. Ladies feel certain of triumph when their dress is pretty and new. They do not consider the charm added to Avhat she wears by her taste, her manners, and her OAvn dis tinction ; she overlooks the fact that she communicates her own qualities to what she chooses or wears. That con stitutes, indeed, the supreme art in dress, and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest fascinations of Avoman ; yet the most efficient in that respect may be unaware that her peculiar charm proceeds from herself, not from her clothes. Madame Henry Standish, the lovely daughter of the Comte Ame'de'e des Cars, possesses that talent in the highest degree. She is marvellously Avell proportioned, rather tall, and the Avord ' elegant ' cannot be more fitly applied than to her. Her grace and beauty are the very ideal of conception, and her manners are so exquisitely refined as to make her altogether original. Nothing could be more lovely than the attitude of her small and proud head on her slightly drooping shoulders. Her long and slender waist is rather stiff, but that very stiffness is charming, and sets off to advantage a flexible and graceful gait, Avhich few ladies possess.

Madame Standish occupies a very nice hotel situated in the Avenue d'le'na. It is furnished and decorated in the purest Louis XVI. style, quite in keeping Avith the delicate beauty of the lady of the house. The parties she gives are regular treats for people who are fond of elegance and refinement. Whatever Madame Standish undertakes leaves no room for criticism. The care with which the guests are selected, the way in which the entertainment is ordered, and her anxiety to please her friends, are all calculated to impress the happy mortals admitted to her private circle Avith the sentiment of their bliss. Madame Standish inherited the shreAvd mind of the Comte Ame'dee des Cars, her father. Her appreciations are correct, and her judgment quite sound. She displays the charm of her conversation Avith skilful reserve. She needs but appear to secure universal approbation. In public she affects to be simply pretty, and only displays the charms of her sprightly mind in the intimate circle of her friends. She was plainly intended by Nature to succeed in this world, and moves about with perfect ease on the slippery ground of society. She is an all-powerful fairy, who keeps for herself the best of her gifts. That last remark does not apply to the Comtesse de Mailly-Nesle. It is impossible to depict Paris society without giving the portrait of one of the most fascinating ladies that that select circle is proud to possess. She is the daughter of the bewitching Comtesse de Goulaine, whose recollection is still alive in Nantes society. She is the exception Avhich con firms the rule to Avhich I called your attention, my friend ; for she is the only lady I know in Avhom the province has not left any trace. Madame de Mailly was eighteen years of age, and in the prime of her striking and enigmatic beauty, when she came to Paris. Her eyes cast somewhat"], [301, "LIFE IN PARIS. 285 sombre looks, and her warm complexion, her tawny hair, her lips which seldom smile, and her perfect and regular features impart to her a charm of her OAvn.

She is an accomplished musician, and nature gave her a superb voice, the affecting accents of Avhich were never surpassed in any of the salons of Paris. Hoav can it be that, being Avealthy and beautiful, and married to a gentle man of high birth, a certain wild melancholy should over cast her features ? I have been told of very dark clouds in her matrimonial sky . . . folloAved by a separation . . . and I could not help thinking that the Muses were very com fortable on Helicon . . . that its height was well suited to their noble aspirations and artistic mission . . . but that they little cared for the happiness of simple mortals.

You will also, my young friend, at the balls where you may be invited, meet with two sisters whose charm will seem to you most captivating ; there is a striking contrast between the delicate dark beauty of the eldest and the light complexion and luxuriant nature of the youngest. It is hardly necessary to tell you that the former is the Baronne de Vaufreland and the latter the Baronne de Noirmont. The Baronne de Vaufreland has lovely and extremely regular features, a tiny face croivned Avith magnificent black hair, tucked up with an artistic simplicity which imparts antique grace to her delicate profile.

ELEVENTH LETTER. SPORT AND CLUBS. I have not yet, dear friend, spoken of sport, and of the clubs which in Paris take up a large portion of men's life. The Jockey Club comes first. Respecting the hippie mania now current, I once heard the following humorous misquotation of Buffon's famous sentence : ' In our days man is the best conquest of . . . horses.'* Many French gentlemen noAV display much interest in horse training and racing, and nobody can deny the importance of those two things from the twin point of view of the improvement of the French cavalry and of the increase of the country's wealth. Contemporary youth Avas tempted by the frivolous appearance of pursuits undertaken with a useful aim, and justifying their im portance by the results obtained. Gradually speculation stepped in, and racing people engaged in betting or, rather, gambling. It was formerly a sign of superiority for a gentleman to be thoroughly acquainted with his stud-book, to be conversant with the performances of each horse, and to be able to talk of his feats, and predict the result of the great races. But times are now altered. The height of * ' La plus belle conquete qu'a faite l'homme, c'est le cheval.'"], [303, "SPORT AND CLUBS. 287 skill for racing amateurs noAV consists in obtaining informa tion, or, as the saying noAV is, ' in getting a straight tip.' The god ' dollar ' now rules there, as elseAvhere, Avhich does not improve the morality of races. But it Avould be idle to try to check an impulse noticeable in all the classes of the Parisian population ; on the contrary, there is every reason to believe that the groAving taste of people for racing will go on increasing, and all laAvs will prove poAverless against a custom so deeply rooted in the manners of the neAV genera tion. It is hard to work. To apply one's intellect, energy, and power to obtaining a situation in this Avorld requires an amount of resolution superior to the moral level of the men of our time ; whereas going to the races, betting on a horse at high odds and seeing him Avin, bring at the same time pleasure and easy profits. Too often, alas ! people go to Longchamps or to Auteuil full of the most sanguine hopes, and, on seeing their expectations deceived, seek in suicide the oblivion of their dream, and sometimes the ruin of their honour. That contagion has even reached Avomen, and now certain ladies engage openly in betting. They may be seen in the weighing-ground, elboAving and talking Avith bookmakers, and not spurning to repay with a pretty smile a favourable price or some valuable cue. I will not rate such a conduct, and can only say that it is quite suited to those who are guilty of it. As a result of the groAving passion for the turf, the Jockey Club is no longer the meeting-place of sportsmen. As soon as the taste for races entered the masses, it ceased to be the exclusive appanage of the upper classes. A curious result of that new state of things is that the fact of being much engaged in speculations concerning horses noAV constitutes a cause of inferiority for a candidate to the membership of the club of the Rue Scribe. The best means of being admitted Avith a fair number of votes consists in being little known, in being fresh from the country, and in having good sponsors. The fact of being the son of a"], [304, "288 SOCIETY IN PARIS. member will almost certainly secure admission in a trice. But although the club now possesses many more members than formerly, it has peculiarly lost in elegance and attraction. Twenty years ago the title of 'member of the Jockey Club ' meant a dandy ; a rival of Caderousse and of Lord Seymour ; a member of the golden youth of the time. Now that title no more applies to the people Avho formerly wore it than does the term of ' subscriber to the Revue des Deux Mondes,' which brought a smile on people's lips on the occasion of the revival of 'Henriette Marechal.'* The title of ' member of the Jockey Club ' applies nowadays to nice little young gentlemen, beardless, and of very pure morals. The fact of being a member of that institution Avill shortly make a young gentleman peculiarly fit for the matrimonial market. Conscientious parents will, on that recommendation, readily give him the hand of their daughter. The Jockey Club was founded on the style of the English club of that name by the Duke of Orleans, under the monarchy of July. The Societe\" d'Encouragement\"f\" was also founded on the same lines, and the two institutions \u2014 connected, but distinct \u2014 have gone on improving ever since. Every member of the club, besides his yearly subscription, is called upon to pay a fixed sum to the Societe d'En couragement, in return for which he receives a ticket, Avith which he is admitted to the private gallery on each of the society's race-courses. Having been declared a public institution, the Socie^ d'Encouragement is not allowed to make profits ; all its income helps to promote the improvement of horses in France. Its annual budget amounts to two millions of * A three- act drama by the brothers Edmond and Jules de Gon court. f Society for the promotion of the breeding of horses in France."], [305, "SPORT AND CLUBS. 289 francs,* and, besides Longchamps, Chantilly, and Fon tainebleau races, Avhere it is at home, and therefore con tributes nearly all the prizes, it aAvards important grants to similar societies in the provinces. It is managed by a board of directors, composed of life-members and deputy members taken from amongst those of the Jockey Club. It is hard to imagine anything more efficient and perfect than the management of this society, and if the various depart ments of the French Administration worked Avith the same punctuality, the Republic and the ratepayers Avould singu larly benefit thereby. The French Steeplechase Society has been instituted on the same plan as the Societe d'Encouragement. Like the latter, it is connected Avith a club \u2014 that of the Rue Royale. It is, hoAvever, impossible to establish any comparison betAveen the tivo. The one affords a field of trial for young horses. Stallions and mares intended to breed blood-horses are recruited amongst the animals its ex amining board has singled out as most perfect. The other, on the contrary, collects the unsuccessful runners, and often succeeds in making capital steeplechasers out of horses that have proved themselves quite unable to win a flat race From the point of view of the patronage of the upper classes, Auteuil cannot compete Avith Longchamps, and I can easily understand wiry. The taste of French ladies is very different from that of their Spanish sisters ; to witness an accident is repugnant to their natures, and the sight of an injured jockey brought back on a stretcher has no attraction for them. That is the reason why French ladies, as a rule, only frequent the racecourse of the Prince de Sagan-f* on the day of the Grand International, Avhen the public to be seen on the Auteuil racecourse reminds one of the select visitors to Longchamps and Chantilly. I do not intend this letter to be a complete picture of the racing Avorld. My object is simply to give you a general * About \u00a330,000. f The promoter of Auteuil Races. 19"], [306, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 290 idea of what that Avorld is, and to sketch on the way its most interesting members. The Jockey Club occupies at the corner of the Rue Scribe and of the Boulevards a spacious apartment, which is, nevertheless, none too large on Saturdays, the ballot day. You must bear in mind, my young friend, that the club numbers eight hundred members, and that on the occasion of the election of some friendly person it is the rule for all the members present in Paris to take part in the ballot. Every large conglomeration of people necessarily gives rise to coteries, and the Jockey Club is no exception to the rule. Certain clubs will retain their original denominations for ever, although one of them, now forsaken by officers, is the meeting-place of the fanatics of social gossip. I mean the two clubs knoAvn under the names of Salon du Camp de Chalons and of Salon du Sport. The former owes its name to the fact that generals formerly met there. There are feAV of the old members of that club who do not remember the Ferays, the Fortous, and a great many more, who left in the minds of their companions in arms the reputation of brave and cheerful comrades. The times have changed, and the generals are now replaced by mere men of the Avorld, and \u2014 horresco rejerens \u2014 by a few deputies. The latter deliver, for the edification of their co- members, the speeches they were unable to make in the House, for clubmen are more forbearing than the members of the Senate or of the Chamber of Deputies. Yet I much regret to state that they rapidly vanish Avhen certain honourable members begin to broach the hackneyed praise of the regime that is to save France. . . . Very different is the Salon du Sport, where the owners of horses and the members of the Board of the Societe d'Encouragement meet to discuss the chances of the various horses, and to talk about the handicaps con structed by MM. de Salverte and de Kergorlay."], [307, "SPORT AND CLUBS. 291 Certain malignant and cross-tempered persons pretend that the members of that club are conceited, and do not receive their visitors as heartily as might be Avished. I do not think so. I shall never agree that such gentlemen as M. Lupin and MM. H. Delamarre, d'Helte, de Fezensac, and scores of others, are not perfect paragons of urbanity and good breeding. M. Auguste Lupin is noAV the oldest member of the Managing Board of the Society d'Encouragement. He has reached a very old age, and is still full of energy and vigour, besides being a most amiable gentleman. He is rather silent and reserved, very shreAvd, and most clever in his particular line. He carefully avoids giving his opinion, and tip-seekers lose their time in trying to get him to speak. He has scored many successes on the turf, and by consulting the pedigree of his horses, it is easy to ascertain that no stud-owner in France has ever made greater sacrifices to improve the breeding of blood-horses. The Baron Schickler is the owner of the stud of Martinvast in the Manche ; his stables are very im portant. HoAvever, I very much doubt whether his profits have contributed much to his income for some time past. He resides with his brother in a very fine hotel, situated in the Place Yendome. The two brothers married the two daughters of the Baron Roger de Sivry, two attractive and prepossessing ladies, who, Avith matchless grace, do the honours of their lovely residence. The dinners of the Hotel Schickler are regular feasts of friendship and sport, enlivened by the hearty and simple friendliness of the masters of the house. Although the invitations are made collectively, each couple does the honours in turn. The warm affection existing between the members of the two families seems to give rise to a current of sympathy that extends to visitors, and imparts a peculiarly graceful and kindly charm to the receptions of the Hotel Schickler. 19\u20142"], [308, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 292 The horses which run under the colours of M. Henry Delamarre belong to a company, the chief shareholders in which are the Comtes de Saint-Roman and de R\u0153derer. The famous crack racers of those stables, Bois-Roussel, Vermout aud Boiard, were trained on the estate of the Comte de R\u0153derer. Few stud-OAvners are as much liked as M. Dela marre, who is on friendly terms Avith everybody. Besides being a consummate sportsman, M. Henry Delamarre is an artist of no mean talent, and many portraits of horses bearing his signature may be seen at the ' Jockey Club.' The horses composing the racing stables of the Comte Gustave de Juigne\" and of the Prince Auguste d'Arenberg are bred and trained at Bois-Boudran, in the department of Loire- Inferieure. I have already spoken of the prince ; his partner, M. de Juignd, has represented the Loire-Inferieure in the Chamber since 1871, and can keep his seat as long as he pleases, for all his constituents are his friends. He is a kindly gentleman, and a most reliable and devoted friend. He has never been married, and all the affection of his simple and good heart Avas centred in his cousin, the much-regretted Marquis de Juigne. The year 1886 left a gloom over Paris society, owing to the almost simultaneous disappearance of several of its most sympathetic members. Although I do not wish to stir all the regrets caused me by the losses of that year, I cannot refrain from retracing here, amongst the portraits of his friends, that of the Due de Castries. The brother of the ' Marechale ' de MacMahon was a gentleman of remarkably pleasant appearance, cheerful and good-natured, and very fond of enjoying himself. He was still a young man when he felt the first symptoms of the disease which was to carry him off', and for a long time he concealed his sufferings with the greatest fortitude. He was the hero of certain love intrigues which for some time furnished certain journals with cheap copy, but he displayed so much distinction and natural gaiety in those"], [309, "SPORT AND CLUBS. 293 little frolics, that the most severe people only saw in them the pardonable pranks of a prodigal child. His charming Avife, the daughter of Sina, the Vienna banker, contributed greatly to spread a knowledge of this amongst her friends. She so loved her attractive husband, that she could not blame his fancies or even his failings. It is, however, but just to remark that the latter Avere toned down by the most exquisite good manners, and by the old traditions of French politeness. Nobody ever possessed a greater number of friends, or was ever more liked by them. The fine residence of his family, Avhich he had most tastefully restored, Avas the scene of delightful private parties. Until his last moment the Due de Castries was surrounded by his familiars. When death came he displayed the greatest courage, endeavouring to the last to dispel the \u2014 alas ! \u2014 too well-grounded appre hensions of his friends. After his death people learned that he was fully aware of the gravity of his case, and that his cheerful calmness only concealed the most stoic resignation. I have often remarked, my young friend, that the golden life of the favourites of fortune tends to promote that indif ference in the face of purely material accidents. Is it that, being accustomed to soar above the brutality and coarseness of physical life, they are unable to grasp all the horror of the trivial and cruel details of the reality of earthly things ? Or is it that, having possessed the best that this miserable world can give, they have learned not to care for its posses sion ? The latter seems to me the true explanation in the majority of cases. I have alloived myself to wander from my subject, and my digression may certainly surprise you in a letter de voted to sport and to the pleasures of Paris society. But at my age people are fond of looking back to the past, and the dear anl sympathetic recollection of the poor Duke, connected as it is with the time I spent both in Vienna and in Paris, has the power of greatly affecting me."], [310, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 294 The stables of the Due de Castries belonged to a company of Avhich he Avas the managing director, Avith the Comte Hallez-Claparede and the Baron Soubeyran as co-partners. The latter is one of the most prominent members of the financial world. He is a gentleman of shrewd and pliant mind, and of uncommon energy. He speculates boldly \u2014 sometimes rashly \u2014 and the most strained situations do not cause him the slightest apparent emotion. He goes through an enormous amount of ivork, resulting from his numerous occupations, and attends ali the sittings of the Chamber of Deputies, where his competence in financial questions and his fluent oratory have secured for him a very influential position, and the attention of even his political opponents. NotAvithstanding those manifold pursuits, he finds time for both sport and society. He is very much liked in the various sedons he frequents, because of the thorough independence of his mind and of the attraction of his solid and fascinating conversation. He is married to Mademoiselle de Saint-Aulaire, a charm ing, intelligent, and cultured lady, Avho has inherited the wit of her family, so famous in the annals of French diplo macy. The Baronne Soubeyran dresses with marvellous taste, and her charity is proverbial. Her only defect is to care far less for society than the latter does for her. Her contemporaries have a right to complain of her reluctance to display on a larger stage than that of her private life the rare and brilliant qualities she possesses. She is, hoAvever, to be seen every Sunday, in the season, in the gallery of the race-course at Longchamps. The Aveighing-enclusure is a very fine sight in the bright sunshine of spring. A motley crowd of private or hired carriages drive hurriedly to the railed entrance, and leave their fares at the door, and the ladies hastily move towards the gallery Avith the hope of securing a good seat. The front row is tacitly reserved to the faithful and regular attendants of sporting events. Nobody would ever"], [311, "SPORT AND CLUBS. 295 think of taking possession of the favourite seat of the Comtesse de Montgommery, for instance ; and people would no doubt express both regret and surprise at not seeing by her side the delicate profile of the Marquise de Saint- Sauveur, the light beauty of Madame de Saint-Roman, or the pretty figure of Madame Maurice Ephrussi. One cannot help admiring the rare and delicate beauty of the latter. She has inherited the prepossessing gifts of the Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild, her mother, and possesses her taste for sport. She is to be seen regularly every morning in the Allee des Poteaux, and at every Longchamps meeting she is to be seen at her usual place. The handsome Mrs. Prime, the daughter of the Baron de Brimont, is often seen Avith her. She is a fair beauty, Avith blue eyes, whom nature, foreseeing that she was to be the wife of an Englishman, endowed Avith the white and pink complexion and the rather languid grace of the Avomen of her adopted country. The second toav in the gallery is usually occupied by a very lively group, composed of the Comtesse Gabrielle de Castries, the Comtesse de Moustiers, the Comtesse Guy de la Rochefoucauld, and the young Comtesse de Mortemart, Avhose husbands are busily engaged in investing some money on the favourite horses of those pretty sportswomen, each of whom bravely risks a louis* and sometimes organize a pool of some importance. . . . They discuss Avith ability the chances of the various horses, and some times grow so fanatically earnest as to take the arm of some male cousin and go and ascertain personally, before the race, the condition of the horses. There exists a coterie composed of young married couples, belonging to the most austere families of the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; it is known under the name of ' Gratin revoke.

It must be confessed that the youth of the present day is fonder of a joke than full of deference to its family. The fact is that the coterie, which has dubbed itself by that extraordinary name, noisily asserts its thorough independence, and loudly discards the opinions and manners obtaining in the families of its mem bers. I have fortunately noticed that the escapades so much talked about only consist in harmless amusements, such as hiring a van to go to Saint-Germain, Avhere the merry set breakfasts and invests some louis on a race ; and I do not think such ' criminal ' conduct likely to pervert, to any degree, the austere manners of the noble ' Faubourg.' It is the rule between each race to take lunch at the bar, and Avalk about in front of the gallery. Young noblemen solicit beforehand the privilege of seeing a lady to the bar, as they would, at a ball, request the honour of a waltz. That custom seems very shocking to the worthy Avives of tradesmen or other persons of the middle classes, who once a year spend ten francs to have the pleasure of sitting in the same gallery with real ladies and hearing their con- versation. I overheard from the lips of such people comments truly charming in their naivete, and throwing a ludicrous light on the Avay in which certain legends amongst the middle- classes concerning the manners of the aristocracy originate. The tinkling of the bell sounding for the last race Avarns people that it will soon be time to go The gallery empties itself, and visitors reach their carriages amidst the greatest confusion. When it rains, people are hustled about, and mere inconvenience becomes a perfect disaster. At last everybody is safe in his carriage, and being driven to Paris. The Parisians are very fond of witnessing the return from the races. The rows of seats along the Champs- Elysees are occupied at an early hour, and sight-seers take"], [313, "SPORT AND CLUBS. 297 delight in recognising the leading members of the sporting Avorld That seems, however, poor pleasure to me ; and very much like that of a schoolboy taken to Tortoni's* in order to ' see other people eating ices.' Carriages may then be seen stopping at the doors of the various clubs. Madame puts her husband down either in the Rue Royale, or at the Cercle des Champs-Elysdes, or at the Jockey Club ; for it is only meet that he should discuss with his friends the results of the day, acquaint them with his luck, or else conceal his discomfiture under a look of satisfaction. The club of the Rue Royale is the most fashionable of all clubs in Paris. The managers display much intelligence in Avatching over the comfort of its internal arrangement ; and thanks to the Comte Arthur de Rouge, who is a master perfect in the art of ordering a meal, the fare is exquisite. Once a year, generally on the eve of the Auteuil Grand Prize, the club gives a dramatic entertainment, to the final rehearsal ot\" which the Avives of members are invited. It is a delicate treat to applaud the Avitty 'revues't of the Marquis de Massa, performed by amateur artists, assisted by the prettiest actresses of Paris. It is an unequalled sight, not easily forgotten. The Cercle de 1' Union Artistique also gives similar entertainments. ... Its members are numerous, and recruited in the Avorld of finance, literature, and art, as also in the aristocracy. Its president is the Marquis de Vogue ; and it is impossible to fill that delicate post Avith more tact and amenity. A commission, chosen amongst the members of the club, and composed of some famous authors, is entrusted Avith the literary portion of those entertainments. The Comte Edmond de Pourtafes, vice-president of the club, superin- * A famous restaurant and cafe in Paris, formerly noted for its ice creams. *|* A skit on the events of the year."], [314, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 298 tends Avith marvellous skill the material details. When everything is ready, the Avives of members are invited, and the room Avhere the acting takes place displays a truly en chanting scene. These literary and social entertainments are truly delightful. The only criticism I can make of them is that they last too long. The public is not so ivell pleased Avith a play that lasts until three o'clock in the morning as with one that is over at midnight. The Cercle de I'Union and the Cercle Agricole display the same spirit, but not the same manners. The former is as strictly closed against intruders as a salon. By certain of its members, who, being AvidoAvers or bachelors, have ac quired the habit of spending there the two-thirds of their lives and of dining there every night, the club is regarded as a regular ' home.' Thus, the majority of its members are grave and serious people, much disliking uproarious or noisy proceedings, and anxiously bent on keeping up the strict tradition of good manners. Few young men solicit the honour of being elected members of it, excepting those Avho, being anxious to affect a serious attitude early in life, run the risk of being balloted for, with the prospect that, on being admitted, they will have to submit themselves to the established rules, and pay an unreserved tribute of respect and consideration toAvards their seniors. That club is frequented by the members of the diplomatic corps accredited to the Government of the Republic. I do not wish, my young friend, to hurt your just susceptibility, but I must confess that I have heard many of my colleagues greatly praise the manner in Avhich they are treated at the Cercle de I'Union, and loudly proclaim that the urbanity of the thorough gentlemen ivhom one meets there amply makes up for the disappointment experienced in other quarters. It appears that the French official world does not offer many resources to the staff's of embassies and legations,"], [315, "SPORT AND CLUBS. 299 from the point of vieAV of social relations. Its manners are not quite as refined as might be wished ; its elegance leaves much to be desired, and Republican simplicity affects manners which are sometimes a little too \u2014 rough. The Cercle Agricole, as remarked above, is similar to the Cercle de I'Union, excepting that its members are much more numerous, that its spirit is not so clannish, and that it possesses to a much larger extent the practical comfort of English clubs. Members are alloAved to invite strangers ; a special dining-room is reserved for the latter, but after dinner the guests may spend the evening in the drawing rooms of the club just as though they belonged to it. Here no coteries exist, and the most hearty sympathy reigns between all these excellent companions. Lectures on scientific and agricultural subjects were formerly held. The custom is now replaced by musical and dramatic entertainments, a change much to the taste of the junior members of the club. The club is held in great honour in the Faubourg Saint- Germain, and is managed with uncommon perfection, thanks to the tact and judgment of the Due de Doudeau ville, its president. The Sporting Club is especially composed of natives of Anjou and Brittany. Its president is the Due de Fitz- James, who is on terms of familiar intimacy with every member. Simplicity, unrestraint, and a perfect freedom for everybody to act and speak as he pleases, are its chief characteristics. The Cercle des Champs-Elysees, formerly known as the Cercle Imperial, is, in my opinion, better situated than any other club in Paris. It occupies a superb mansion at the corner of the Rue Boissy-d'Anglas, with a splendid garden overlooking the Avenue Gabriel, and in summer the empty salons bear witness to the appreciation by the members of the shady boAvers of the latter. It is frequented by many financiers and by former officials of the Imperial Govern-"], [316, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 300 ment; but the manners of its members are everything that could be desired, and political questions do not raise any storms there. The members are well-bred gentlemen and eclectic in politics, so that all opinions are represented in the Cercle des Champs-Elysees. TWELFTH LETTER. LIFE OUT OF PARIS. Since the war, my young friend, the fashion is gradually spreading of spending the winter in the country. It is noAV almost general, and, unless having some imperative reason for acting otherwise, such as a son day-boarder in a college, or a husband in the Chamber of Deputies or engaged in business pursuits, no lady Avould ever think of coming to Paris before the beginning of the spring. It is usual to leave Paris to- Avards the end of June or in the first fortnight of July. Two dates give the signal for the scattering of Paris society. The first is that of the ' Grand Prix ' of Paris. The week that follows that great sporting event Avitnesses the departure of people who do not quite believe in the charm of the Boulevards during the summer. The second date is that of the fete of the 14th of July. That democratic holiday is hardly to the taste of the members of society. Of all the pleasures now offered to good old Demos by its rulers, the review of the troops in the Bois de Boulogne is the only one that has the power of attracting the upper classes. I must say that it is much appreciated, and last year' the gallery set apart for the members of the Jockey Club was literally full ; that is quite natural, and I undei' stand it all the more easily that I, a foreigner, could not help feeling real emotion on Avitnessing the march-past of * The original French edition of ' Society in Paris ' was published in 1887."], [317, "LIFE OUT OF PARIS. 301 the brave tars and gallant little soldiers of France just returned from Tonkin.

People generally take advantage of the summer to go to the seaside, to inland Avatering - places, or to pay visits to some friends, so as to be on their own estates only toAvards the beginning of September for the opening of the hunting season. Lucky are those who possess a country-seat Avithin easy distance of Paris : they are ahvays receiving visitors Avho call to spend the day or the evening Avith them. The chief country residences close to Paris, the OAvners of which entertain their friends, without formal invitation, during the months of June and July, are the charming villa known by the name of La Vallee-aux-Loups belonging to the Due de Bisaccia, and situated in the immediate neighbourhood of Sceaux ; the superb chateau of Sceaux, in the possession of the Marquis de Trevise ; Dampierre, the grand residence Avhere the Luynes formerly entertained their Sovereigns ; and Dampont, belonging to the Comte de Kersaint. Nothing could equal the gaiety and good-humour of these meetings of holiday-making society. It must be confessed, however, that rural pleasures only contribute in a very limited degree to the amusement of the upper ch'^es. They dance exactly to the same tunes as they did in their Paris salons, and assemble to talk of passing events, under the shelter of tents formed of pink-striped ticking, the subdued light of which suits marvellously the com plexion of young beauties. The only essential difference between country and town parties consists in the style of dress. Young noblemen"], [318, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 302 when visiting in the country Avear irresistible lounge-coats, with extraordinary square stripes, or else equally short Avhite flannel coats of immaculate freshness, setting off to advantage the bright purple of the pink stuck in their button-hole. Tbe young adepts at the tennis or polo games even take the liberty of appearing in the bold though elegant neglige'e of a silken shirt sliOAving the development of muscles, very faintly reminding one of the ideal forms of Hercules Farnese. The sight of the various dresses of pretty ladies, with nature as background, is most artistic and picturesque. In some instances \u2014 and seeing that the present fashion in ladies' dresses for the country is getting tolerably bold, and excuses almost any fancy \u2014 the sight presented by ladies at a country-party may be compared Avith that of a fancy dress ball. You must not, hoAvever, think that the aristocracy spends its holidays in utter idleness, finding nothing to do but admire figures and attitudes, coats and dresses. Often, late in the day, the carriages are ordered, and a merry troop of people drive under the shade of the vener able trees of lovely parks and forests, and only return home at night for a late dinner, which might more fitly be called a supper, if that latter term did not sound rather suspicious in the ears of the upper classes. When the day is hot enough to suggest the idea of a bath, the male portion of the company indulges in aquatic sport . . . much to the delight of the young men who make athletic sport their chief object, Avithout any of them suspecting that it may, in the long-run, prove quite detrimental to their intellectual activity \u2014 a not altogether improbable result. Women, as a rule, are less inclined to swimming. I have noticed that cold water is very beneficial to young women, but rather disagrees Avith ladies over thirty years of age. At any rate, bathing in public is no longer fashionable. Early in August racing people flock to Trouville and to"], [319, "LIFE OUT OF PARIS. 303 Deauville. Those tAvo watering-places, where nobody is ever seen bathing, are only divided by the little river Toucques. They each receive pretty much the same number of visitors. The fine beach of Trou ville is a favourite place of resort in the morning and in the afternoon, but the casino of Deauville is alone frequented by the upper classes. Deauville, as a watering-place, Avas founded by the Due de Morny, Avhom death prevented carrying out completely his plan of transforming that little Normandy village into a French Brighton. To make matters ivorse, the sea receded, leaving a vast stretch of dull and flat sand between the sumptuous villas built by the most prominent personages of the Imperial Court and the blue waters of the Channel. The specula tion has thus failed to a large extent ; the landlords, being discouraged by the diminution in the price of land, hastened to sell houses Avhich Avere now too large for their reduced style of life, and noAV Deauville is chiefly frequented by bankers and manufacturers, and, far from exciting the jealousy of other Avatering-places in Normandy, ought rather to envy them. All that was done in favour of Deauville has benefited Trouville. The villas of the Princesse de Sagan and of the Vicomtesse de Courval are favourite places of resort for the aristocratic visitors attracted to Deauville by the races. The small but lovely ' Villa Persane ' belongs to the Vicom tesse de Courval, and is a very fit residence for that beauti ful lady, who seems to be one of those priucesses one reads of in the ' Thousand and One Nights.' The hotels are getting full. The Baronne de Rothschild occupies, Avith Monsieur and Madame Ephrussi, jun., all the first-floor of the Hotel de Paris. The Duchesse de la Tremoille puts up at the Roches-Noires, also in the company of her daughter and of that lady's husband, the Comte de la Rochefoucauld. All those people breakfast late, in order to prolong their"], [320, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 304 matutinal walk, one of the chief attractions of a stay at the seaside. A few fanatics take a bath. The sea is about the last thing you hear people talk about at Trou ville, Avhere feAV visitors consider it as the chief attraction, as most people do in all other watering-places. At two o'clock everybody makes his way to the race course, the weighing-ground of which is very similar in appearance to what Longchamps is in the week. There is plenty of room, and ladies' dresses are seen at a sufficient distance to be appreciated in globo. The majority of the visitors are sportsmen, and ladies, if so inclined, need only choose amongst a croAvd of admirers. The Comtesse de Montgommery usually selects the week of the Trouville races to invite her friends, on a visit to the seaside places of Normandy, to some grand party at her beautiful Chateau of Fervacques. The guests go there in sets : all the mail-coaches are full, and all sorts of more or less elegant vehicles are hired long before to convey those members of the company who cannot be accommodated in the coaches. Those parties generally mean a grand dinner, the performance of some play and a ball. The lovely hostess does the honour of the fete with the most cheerful tact, and the Comte de Montgommery, her husband, who is also one of the leading French sportsmen, assists her with the greatest courtesy. The guests return home very late at night, or rather early in the morning, but their pleasure has been so perfect that they may well put up with a little fatigue. Dieppe is also a favourite spot of the aristocracy. The Duchesse de Berry Avas the first to detect the charm of that pretty little tOAvn, so nicely situated and sheltered. She faithfully spent several summers there, and, thanks to her, the neAV Avatering-place soon became fashionable amongst the Royalists. The Marquis de Biencourt and the Comte de Montmorency had villas built there. It is now one of the favourite places of resort of the"], [321, "LIFE OUT OF PARIS. 305 foreign residents of Paris. It preserves nevertheless a good deal of its former appearance, OAving to its being the seat of fine residences belonging to the Princesse de Broglie, the Comtesse de l'Aigle, and the Comte de Clermont-Tonnerre, whom their numerous friends visit during the summer season. The aristocracy does not associate Avith foreign residents. On the beach in Dieppe the children them selves do not mix, and the future ladies look doAvn upon the little foreigners whose fine features and rich trimmings contrast peculiarly with the simple linen smock-frocks of the children of the greatest French families. . . . Next to Deauville and Dieppe comes . . . Luchon. The lovely little Pyrenean village is enlivened in July and August by the presence of a crowd of visitors more elegant than select. It is difficult to imagine a more pleasant and varied life than that of the bathers Avho do not place implicit faith in the healing properties of the Avaters, and rather seek to forget their ailments in mirth and gaiety. The days are thus spent in merry excursions to the picturesque sites of the lovely neighbourhood, in fishing trout in the fine streams, the flashing Avaters of which besprinkle the surrounding rocks, in listening for hours to the SAveet music of the open-air concerts, when it is so easy to say pretty things to fair ladies, under the shelter of their parasols, or during the close clasping of a waltz. That enchanted spot is highly favourable to offensive tactics. Eve's daughters have, it seems, different views of morality, according as they are in Paris or in Avatering places. The latter offer exceptional facilities for taking advantage of whatever successes were patiently obtained during the Paris season, and a campaign begun with the caution of Fabius may there be concluded Avith the rapidity of Napoleon's victories. It is, therefore, the land of promise of lovers, but still more so that of gamblers. The gambling - tables have 20"], [322, "306 SOCIETY IN PARIS. many customers, some of whom discreetly endeavour to test the truth of the well-knoAvn proverb. Early in September the wealthy land-owners reach at last their princely country-seats, and invite their friends, some of them hardened Parisians, and young men not yet in possession of their estates, to the opening ot the hunting season. Indeed, the ownership of a shooting-box requires the laying-out of a considerable amount of money, and the maintenance of a numerous and costly staff throughout the year, particularly Avhen the owners also breed game in order to supply the battues organized in the alter-season. It is, therefore, but natural that they should be anxious to recoup themselves for the money invested by treatmg their friends to a few days of prime shooting. A great many ladies, following the example of the Comtesse de Paris, now indulge in shooting with their husbands and friends; but they generaby reserve their cynegetic abilities for the autumnal battues, better suited for their physical inferiority. Confirmed sportsmen start at daybreak, in order to rest during the heat of the day ; the ladies, and the less fanatic of the male guests, are satisfied to overtake them at lunch time, when ail the company meet at some farm or in the cottage of some gamekeeper, where the meal is served and cheertuliy enjoyed, and often becomes the pretext for a long rest. The whole party is usually back home for dinner at about eight o'clock in the evening, and everybody enjoys the first roast game of the season, and his share of a few bottles of capital wine; as for the manner in which the evening is spent, it is useless to mention it. I have had too many occasions of witnessing such sad issue of the opening of the hunting-season, when the men, overcome by fatigue, prolong their stay in the smoking-room, there to secure some instalment of the night's sleep, and the ladies, exasper ated by such desertion, cast the weight of their legitimate"], [323, "LIFE OUT OF PARIS. 307 indignation on those of their admirers who, being stronger or more faithful, devote themselves to keep them company. I fancy, my young friend, that the growing latitude now .granted to smokers, and the tolerance extended to cigarettes, and even to cigars, in the majority of drawing-rooms, proceeds from the too frequent repetition of such scenes. But that condescension on the part of ladies is not of great avail, and I strongly advise my pretty little friends to discard temporarily, during the opening of the hunting season, those of their admirers who are possessed by the hunting mania. A tired sportsman is the last of flirts, and will only recover himself in that capacity towards the close of Sep tember. A little quarrelling, wound up eventually with a nice little reconciliation, would be just the thing in that case. When the warm weather is over, Avhen October has scorched the leaves of trees, and when the mornings are fresh and sharp, huntsmen are delighted. Hunting is an essentially aristocratic pleasure. Tbe Kings of France were great huntsmen. Their high barons and petty lordlings regarded it as a pleasure and an honour to follow the exampfe of the Sovereign, and to possess as manv hounds as they could afford, in order to keep up, each of them within his own manor, the noble traditions of hunting, and to train their sons from an early age in that proud science, in order to get them used to fatigues con sidered necessarv to form efficient military men. Francis I. said that a nobleman could ahvays receive his King in the poorest castle, provided he could supply his royal visitor with a good horse, a well-trained hound, and . . . a good-looking woman. The kingly knight was not hard to please ! The good and sound traditions of hunting haA'e been kept up by the French aristocracy. Certain provinces, amongst which are Poitou, Anjou, Maine, Morvan, and Bor- 20\u20142"], [324, "308 SOCIETY IN PARIS. delais, seem to be specially entrusted Avith the keeping of those manly traditions. The neighbourhood of Tours and Saumur is the promised land of huntsmen. Within a radius of sixty miles the hounds of MM. de Puysegur, de Champchevrier, Hain guerlot de Castellane, and de Mailfe, are let loose daily, and make yearly visits to the forests of the neighbouring departments. The hunting equipage of the Marquis du Luart is renoAvned in the Sarthe. The Comte Charles de la Rochefoucauld and the Comte de Levis-Mirepoix are capital deer-hunts men. But the Nimrod of them all is the Marquis de Chambray, who hunts in Normandy, and everybody7 still remembers the grand festivities that were held on the occasion of his killing his thousandth stag. In the immediate neighbourhood of Paris, huntsmen have the opportunity of folloAving the hounds of the Duchesse d'Uzes at Rambouillet, of the Vicomte de Greffulhe, and of M. Ephrussi at Fontainebleau, of M. Servan at Hallatte and at Chantilly, and of MM. de 1' Aigle at Compiegne. But if Louis XIII., who was so fond of hunting, were to visit now his fine kingdom of France, I fancy that he would prefer hunting Avith some petty nobleman from Anjou or Touraine than with any of the brilliant equipages of which I have just spoken ; and certain amateur huntsmen, holding high State offices, avIio honour with their presence the hunts at Rambouillet, Avould, doubtless, seem to him to profane rather than practise his favourite sport. Some ladies are fond of hunting ; such, for instance, are the Marquise de Castellane, the Comtesse Urbain de Mailfe, the Comtesse de Gontaut, and the Comtesse Charles de la Rochefoucauld. But their pattern is the Duchesse d'Uzes, Avho is as conversant with hunting as an old whipper-in, and carries her fanaticism so far as to drive game in by her self at unlikely hours. But battues constitute the only kind of sport that has"], [325, "LIFE OUT OF PARIS. 309 any attraction for ladies. The Comtesse de Pourtales and the Duchesse de la Tremoille are the best feminine shots in the immediate neighbourhood of Paris. From the first day of November until the close of the hunting season the owners of the shootings of Ferrieres, Esclimont, Bois-Boudran, Presles, and Saint-Germain treat their numerous guests to regular slaughters of all sorts of game. Those pleasures contribute, by themselves, as also by the visitors they attract, to break the monotony of life in the country. Most ladies consider life in a chateau as very dull, and loudly denounce the deficiency of their pleasures, ahvays the same thing over again. You may think me, my dear friend, most partial to ladies in my criticism ; but I am sincerely of opinion that their claims are just, that life in Paris offers more resources to feminine activity, and that the custom of spending the Avinter in the country is quite detrimental to ladies, and to the sole advantage of gentle men. Indeed, it cannot be very pleasant for a newly-married lady to lunch hurriedly, to see the hunting party off\" as far as the door, and hear their merry banter, especially Avhen she has to Avait for them all the afternoon Avithout any other distraction than chatting, reading, doing some needleAvork, or writing her letters, or playing laAvn-tennis with lady friends, all tending only to make her feel her solitude still more. At last the day is over, the absent return, and everybody sits down cheerfully to a substantial and comfortable tea. Groups are formed ; of the number, a couple takes pos session of a small table. The gentleman relates his deeds of prowess ; they both laugh ; they have many things to tell each other. It is the most pleasant time in the whole day, and at the idea of that meeting, so anxiously contem plated, many a pretty little heart beats with joy under the tea-gown put on to please him."], [326, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 310 THIRTEENTH LETTER. PIETY AND CHARITY AMONGST THE UPPER CLASSES. When evil-minded persons witness the fine ladies of the upper classes spending their best energy in going about from church to church, collecting money for, and settling the details of, their charitable deeds . . . they will often say, ' What sins have they not to atone for !' They regard the brave and bold anxiety displayed by ladies in the pursuit of their pious and charitable aims as proceeding from personal and selfish motives. That is a strange mistake. The ladies of the upper classes consider that the collection and distribution of alms constitute not the least important of their social duties. It is usual for ladies to support some charitable institu tion of their choice as soon as they are married. They may help others, if they please, but their best assistance must go to that which they have selected. Every great French family assists and patronizes some charitable works. Thus the Talleyrands are the patrons of the institution known as l'\u0152uvre de la Misericorde,* the Ganays of that of les Amis de l'Enfance,-|- the Muns of Roman Catholic working men's associations, and the Gontauts of l'\u0152uvre des Hopitaux.J There would be no end to the nomenclature were I to mention all the various charitable institutions founded or supported by the members of the French aristocracy. Young married ladies continue, as a rule, to assist the institution patronized by their families. When their choice is not prejudiced by previous custom, they generally adopt the wisest plan, Avhich consists in relieving the sufferings of the poor of their district. * The work of mercy. f The children's friends. X The work in aid of hospitals."], [327, "PIETY AND CHARITY AMONGST UPPER CLASSES. 311 I cannot praise them too much for that. Night vagrants are, no doubt, interesting ... it is but right that we should provide them with shelter. It is also right to establish ambulances to attend people who meet with accident in the streets. . . . But we must not forget that on the upper most floors of a great many houses in Paris there live miser able families for the benefit of whom nobody organizes either concerts or balls. ... I therefore much admire the good sense of the ladies who think of those poor creatures, and relieve their distress through the medium of the parish priest or of the sisters of mercy of their district. Such deeds of charity are, doubtless, quieter and more humble than so-called charitable parties ; their perform ance is, perhaps, not quite so attractive, but they are, I fancy, much more useful. That way of practising charity reaches its aim more surely, and its moral teachings are much higher. . . . Judge of it for yourself, dear friend. A young lady may successfully undertake public collec- tions, in view of some charitable purpose, four or five times in her life, seldom more ; if married, and keeping house in great style, she may give some grand fete every second or third year. She then writes letters to all her acquaintances, and may fairly expect that every hundred of letters will bring in about a thousand francs* It is thus easy for her to collect a rather important sum, which, being entrusted to the treasurer of the undertaking, is employed without any further interference on the part of its promoter. Such indifference is most detrimental to the judicious use of the money collected. Women possess more benevolence than they do logic and consistence They like to feel the pleasure caused by their kindness, and to experience the anticipated gratitude aroused by their generosity. They would display more zeal and perseverance in the performance of good deeds if a more intelligent advantage was taken of their sentimental nature, and if they were acquainted with the misfortunes they help to relieve. * \u00a340."], [328, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 312 It is, therefore, my humble opinion that the promoters of works of charity should, as do parish-priests, secure the active co-operation of contributors. When the lady brings the proceeds of her collection to a cure', he refers her to the sisters of mercy, who fix an appointment for some early morning. On that day, the lady puts on a woollen dress of humble appearance, and a very simple bonnet, and covers her face with a thick veil, in order to follow the good sister. The latter carries a large basket, containing two or three joints of meat, some baby-linen, a few bottles of wine, some drugs, some snuff \u2014 a little treat intended for the old people \u2014 and last, though not least in the eyes of the interesting people for whom they are intended, some sugar-sticks for the little ones. The two messengers of charity go through dark lanes \u2014 so ill-paved that they stumble and slip all along the way \u2014 and finally climb the rickety staircase of a wretched looking house. As she goes up the broken, filthy stairs, the refined and wealthy lady thinks that to be doomed to breathe for ever the heavy and rank smell of those dismal abodes of misery is about the worst fate that can befall anyone. . . . She at last reaches her destination ; a door is opened. On looking in the room, she at once alters her opinion, and remains some time overpoAvered by pity and grief at the sight she witnesses. ... A sick man is laid upon a wretched pallet, the hearth is cold, the wind blows in through the broken windows, some sickly babies in rags are fighting over a dried-up piece of bread, and a scowling and cross-looking woman in a poor cotton dress retires sullenly in a corner at the sight of the visitors, and pre tends to be engaged in cleaning some dishes. . . . The room contains no furniture except a lame old table and a couple of broken chairs. ... On the wall a spot indicates the place formerly occupied by a cupboard. In the meantime the sister of mercy converses gently"], [329, "PIETY AND CHARITY AMONGST UPPER CLASSES. 313 Avith the sick man and comforts him. He ansAvers, and acquaints her with his sufferings. The saintly woman listens with compassion ; she casts a look of encourage ment towards her companion, and calls her attention to the little ones, Avho have ceased crying and stare at the new-comers. Having recovered herself, the lady takes bravely a seat, and, opening the basket, she smiles sweetly at the poor children, and hands them the sugar-sticks and a nice loaf of bread. . . . They hesitate at first, and keep at a distance ; but the eldest suddenly makes up his mind, comes up hurriedly and takes the bread ; with his other hand he catches hold of the sweets, and after a little persuasion is at last induced to sit on the lap of the delighted lady. His brother and sister are on the floor devouring the bread and crunching the bonbons, Avhilst the pretty, active and un- gloved hands are busily engaged in unloading the basket. A knitted vest, a petticoat and a bonnet complete the dress of the little girl, who, dancing about for joy, runs up to her mother. ' Come and see, mother . . . she is very kind, the lady : come on ' . . . says the little one to the poor woman, Avho, attentive and speechless, vainly endeavours to recover her countenance. Confused, now she comes up ... ; she is won by the kindness of her visitor. Still holding the baby in her arms, the young lady rises, and quietly, with simple and gentle dignity, says to the mother : ' They are very pretty, your children, madam. . . . Let me help you to bring them up. ... I love them already. . . . Mothers can always understand each other.' The poor woman, overcome with emotion, is sobbing. The sun of hope has beamed forth on her wretched and ignorant soul ! Do you not think, dear friend, that that lady has done a good day's work ? You must not fancy that such cases are rare. If you only take the trouble of wandering through the streets of the Faubourg Saint-Germain or of the Faubourg Saint-"], [330, "SOCIETY IN PARIS. 314 Honors, or of wending your way to the Gros-Caillou* early some morning, the fact of your meeting persons you least expect will substantiate my statement. As already mentioned, that is, in my opinion, the only effective wav of practising charity. Yet I must confess to you, dear friend, that nothing seems more entertaining to me than the sight of a bazaar held by ladies in support of some charity. I much like to see my pretty friends earnestly engaged in selling knick-knacks to the various gentlemen of their acquaintance, whom they bravely call as they see them pass their stalls. The most timid become bold on those occasions. They hand you an article worth twenty francs at the outside ; ' It is worth forty francs,' they insidiously remark ; ' but ... as a keepsake of me you must give five louist for it.' Of course, you have it wrapped up and pay whatever price the fascinating sales woman may ask you for . . . the pencil-case or the sachet which, ten seconds later, a thousand-franc note could not purchase. . . . As it is only right that virtue should be attractive, ladies put on their best dresses on these occasions. Besides, they must be prepared to compete with each other as to who shall have the greatest number of buyers and collect the largest sum. I must here acquaint you with a secret thought of mine. Whenever I attend such sales I always remember the sweetly waggish and winning expression of poor Descfee's face in the passage where Froufrou. J having allowed someone to kiss her during the rehearsal of some play, candidly remarks to her husband, enraged at the impertinence : ' It is for the benefit of the poor !'

What would Froufrou say to them . The absurd ideas of novelists and Avriters of articles on the tasUions current in society concerning the special dresses worn by ladfes wnen they go to church are most ludicrous. 1 should like to know in what church or chapel those literary gentlemen ever saw ladies dressed up in abbesses' clothes. 1'nose writers compiaisantiy represent the ladies of the upper classes as wearing drugget, and ingenuously suggest tne adoption of a rope round the Avaist, and of a long penitent's veil to conceal the face. . . . But, iriend, ladies go to church as they are : in the morning in morning dress, and in the atternoon in visiting dress; for God is less punctilious than men. And their light httle step sounds as lively on the stone pavement of a church as on the floor of a ball-room ; it does not prevent them kneeling down and praying in earnest. The faith of their ancestors, dear friend, is alive in the hearts of French ladies, and it cannot be denied that that faith has grown such strong and deep roots \u2014 it is so inti mately connected and blended with their Avhole moral beings \u2014 as to have become an integral part of them. They are tne vestals of that sacred hre Avhich must ever be kept burning. They impart the ardour of their faith to then sons, aud its sweet charm to their daughters, thus keeping up the antique tradition which made men brave and strong, and women chaste and meek, in the time when old France still believed, and prospered, and performed great deeds.
