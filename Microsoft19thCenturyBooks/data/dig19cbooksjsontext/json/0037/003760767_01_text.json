It was a quarter to seven when the row began \u2014 just before dinner-time. Notice that I say the row. A row was as common in our house as \u2014 say, in Ireland, or in the Chamber of Deputies in France. A row wouldn't have been worth recording. But this row taught me two or three things, which I never afterwards forgot. Is it not something for a man to learn \u2014 a man in futuro, for I had been but recently vol. I.

Let me confess the truth. I had been robbing my parents of sundry pears and sundry bunches of grapes, and conscience had driven me into a recess behind a naked and extremely chubby boy in white marble, avIio was always aiming at every one who passed him with a bow and arrow. Down behind him I crouched, waiting for an opportunity to escape. I was rather interested in this boy, for mamma's friends used to say that I was very like him (when mamma was there), and used to poke their fingers in my cheeks and pull my curls, and call me ' a httle love,' and ask me how many / meant to shoot when I began. I wondered how many he shot. I never saw him hit anybody myself, but Therese,"], [13, "ROWS 3 mamma's French maid, said he did sometimes. And she was all dimples and white teeth when I asked her, and sobbing before she had answered, her pretty hand upon her bosom as if a sudden pain had sprung up there and was more than she could bear. ' Did he ever hit you, Therese ? ' I asked. ' Hit me ? Oh, but he is foolish, the little one ! He is always hitting me, my little monsieur.' ' When, Therese ? ' All the days, petit. When men smile at me, and they do sometimes, why I \u2014 I feel a pain here, and that is his arrow.' She was showing all her pearls again. ' Does he hit you when I put my arms round your neck and tell you that I love you better than anyone in the Avorld ? \u2014 no, not better than my nurse,' I added, with a great feeling of compunction. ' See how he knows already hoAv to make B 2"], [14, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 4 love, the little one,' laughed Therese. ' Wait till you are a man, mon enfant, and break hearts then.' ' Is it good to break hearts ? Papa whips me sometimes Avhen I break other things.' 1 Good ? I do not know. It is very easy and Men drble ; funny, you call it ; and it makes you laugh, and the other cry. That is why I laugh and cry and sing and dance : Tra, la, la, la, la. L'amour \u2014 But what can a bebe like you knoAV about love ? ' Very httle, I dare say. But as she laughed, I felt a sharp, sharp pain in the spot Avhere my heart wen' pit-a-pat, keen as an arrow. I looked up in sudden passion to the marble image, still levelling his boAv \u2014 yet with a difference. Some effect of fallina: light or shade had changed his arch smile into a cruel sneer. Having introduced you to Therese, let me go back to the row."], [15, "ROWS 5 From my hiding-place I had a good view of the staircase, and could also see every door leading into the hall. To my right was my father's room, the oaken door hidden behind another covered with baize which SAvung to and fro on noiseless hinges. Beyond that was the dining-room, its door slightly ajar, as I had left it when I had fled before William and the butler with my booty. For I had been tempted down into these lower regions as our first mother was tempted \u2014 by lust after forbidden fruit. I was looking earnestly into this room in order to take advantage of the first oppor tunity for escape. The butler's calm face was discomposed ; he had found out the disarrange ment of his dishes, and was, no doubt, inwardly swearing revenge. I watched him repair the breaches I had made, noiselessly putting the master-touch to the tout ensemble, while William stood at his side, possibly profiting from the"], [16, "6 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE lesson he was receiving, but with a far-away look in his honest blue eyes and a pallor over his usually ruddy cheek, hardly like the visible and outAvard signs of inward satis faction. ' The de'il tak' him,' muttered the butler, who was a Scotchman ; ' my finest pears and juiciest bunch of grapes ! ' Of course. Did he think I'd risk my reputation for nothing ? ' Cruel and heartless,' murmured William, ' and yet so pretty, so pretty.' I was a pretty boy \u2014 I had been told that many and many a time (by mamma's friends principally) \u2014 but cruel and heartless ! O'ho, William, look out for nips ! ' And then they turned together and my opportunity Avas come. But no ! a footfall on the stairs. A sweet saucy face appearing above the banister. I slunk back again into my corner. I couldn't"], [17, "ROWS 7 trust Therese. She might connive at my escape or might betray me, just according to her humour. Her humour was dangerous noAv. Her eyelids Avere reddened, and in the centre of each pale cheek burned a crimson spot ; yet out of her broAvn eyes flashed a light so intense that the staircase seemed illuminated Avith it, and her mouth was wreathed with dimples. Somebody had angered Therese, and somebody Avas going to get punished for it. She came down the broad oaken steps slowly ; her shapely little head erect and haughty, her smiling lips quivering a little. As she passed the statue behind which I was crouching, she turned her sparkling eyes full upon it, clenched her little fist, and laughed. Then more quickly, and with an air of passionate resolution, she passed on to my father's room, pulled open the baize-covered"], [18, "8 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE door, and rapped sharply upon the oaken one behind it \u2014 once, twice. My father himself appeared in answer to the summons. As she raised her beautiful, agitated face to his red, pompous, overbearing one, I felt rather than saAV that a second spectator had appeared upon the scene. A second heart began to beat in quick unison with mine. ' What is it ? ' said my father. ' It is madame who has bidden me to go,' answered the girl, sobbing. ' It is madame avIio has raised the foot to kick me out of the house. Is it that I am a slave to lick the dust at madame's bidding ? I am come to say my adieux to monsieur. Je men vais.' ' No, you don't,' said my father. 'I am sensible of the kindness of mon sieur,' continued Therese ; ' I have a heart I. Aud then le petit will cry after me. But I have"], [19, "ROWS 9 my honour too, and \" slut \" and \" hussy \" are words that stick like pitch and burn like fire. Je men vais.' As she uttered these words for the second time, the shadow of a sound fell over my ears and deafened them. Was it Eros himself crying out in tones of smothered agony, ' Therese ! Therese ! Mamsell Therese ! ' ? I saw my father's arm around her waist, and her face raised to his with a maddening look upon it \u2014 a look full of simulated coyness and sly invitation, and then And then the grapes in my hand turned sour as vinegar, and the pears in my trouser pockets heavy as lead. The row was at its fiercest when I became conscious of it. There was a rustle of silken skirts, a stamping of heavy feet, hoarse threatenings, and through all, the sharp sound of a woman's voice, envenomed with bitter sarcasm and biting innuendo. It ended with"], [20, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 10 the usual wind-up of hysterics, during which my mother was carried aAvay prostrate. Yet, though she fasted and my father diued, the victory was hers, and I knew it as well as anyone. I was no longer afraid of discovery. Pain had driven out fear. I walked boldly into the dining-room, and sitting down in a corner half hidden by a heavy silken curtain, watched my father dine. The butler watched him too, and so did William. He didn't seem to enjoy his dinner much, I thought. He took it, as I took medicine, in great gulps, washing all down Avith copious draughts of Avine. Once he broke out into a furious passion, dashing a full wineglass on to the table, and staining the white damask deep red Avith its contents. The dinner was over at last. It seemed a long time before the butler and William went away, but they went finally. And then he"], [21, "ROWS 11 gave up trying to seem not to care. He leaned his head upon his hand, so that I could see the silver threads running through his hair, and groaned and struck the table with his fist until all the crystal on it trembled. I had been feeling towards him like a judge towards a criminal ; now my mind suddenly changed its attitude. We were both wrongdoers and both suffering. ' Papa,' I said, ' papa ! ' He looked up with a start ; then his blood shot eye brightened, the heavy frown passed away from his forehead, and his lips parted to a smile. ' Hoighty-toighty ! ' he said ; ' you there, little mannikin ? ' We were both wrongdoers and both suffering, nevertheless I had a burning word to say, and meant to say it. Yet my resolu tion was faltering fast. He was looking at me with a piteous longing in his eyes \u2014 a longing"], [22, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 12 I knew how to interpret. He was not over sensitive, but the sharp, bitter words of his wife might have Avounded a tougher-skinned nature even than his, and he was bleeding inwardly. He Avanted a morsel of the only cure for heart wounds. He was hungering for a fragment of love. Yet I hung back still, even though he put out both red, hard, beringed hands, and would fain have drawn me to his knee. ' Have a drop of wine, my boy ? ' Child-like, I abandoned the weapon I held to grasp the one he offered. I cried out in a passion, born of the conflict within me. 'It is wine makes you so red and ugly, and I hate it.' He half rose and clenched his fist. I drew back, involuntarily ducking my head to avoid the blow I expected. But he only laughed, repeating my words as if they had been a joke."], [23, "ROWS 13 ' Makes me red and ugly, does it ? Very well, you sha'n't have wine if you don't like it.

' That ' And in spite of all my efforts I burst out a-crying. ' Good gracious, what's the matter ? Tell me what it is, my boy. Everything I have is yours. I've been working all my life that you may have everything you want.' ' But I want ' ' Speak out, don't be afraid.' A certain sense of childish dignity came now to my aid. I wiped my eyes, drew up my head, straightened my back, and spoke out like a man."], [24, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 14 ' I want Therese. I love her. I shall be a man some day, and I am going to marry her.' If I had sprung up suddenly into a man before his eyes, he could not have looked more confounded. Then the humour of the thing struck him. He burst into a loud fit of laughter, and laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks. ' You are beginning early, young man.' I resented his ridicule almost as much as I had resented the foregoing insult. There was no danger of my crying now. My heart was swelling high, but it Avas with pride and indignation. My body seemed to swell with it. ' And I don't want \u2014 I don't choose,' I added haughtily, ' that anyone shall kiss her but me. William is only a servant. You have o-0t mamma, and ought to be content.' My argument was simple and childlike enough. But it led him back into the old track, wherein his soul had been wanderino-"], [25, "ROWS 15 so drearily. He seemed to forget \u2014 he might well forget \u2014 that he was speaking to a child. ' Yes,' he repeated, ' I've got mamma, and I ought to be content.

Notwithstanding my opposition, and notwith standing my father's, Therese had to go the next day, and, to add to my bewilderment and dismay and despair, Wilham went with her. There had been a deep, deep reason for that indignant clause in my reproach to my father : ' William is only a servant ' \u2014 a reason so profound that my childish brain only just perceived, and had not yet grasped and defined, it.

Other men said these things, for the saying of which I cordially hated them (I felt, but could not express), and only William never did. Yet a secret instinct showed me that his blame meant more than their praise, his pained look of disapproval more than their flattery. Sometimes, behind her back, these sycophants would laugh at Therese, calling her a spoiled chit, a minx, a heartless French coquette, and the like, Avhile William would keep indignant silence or break out into indignant defence, ahvays saying that she was a deal better \u2014 a thousand times better \u2014 than she would appear."], [29, "MY FIRST LOVE 19 And once I was witness to a scene between these two which tended to make my fleeting impression into a permanent, yet still incom prehensible, one.

I was alone in the day nursery, laying my bricks to the time of a tune my nurse was humming in the room adjoining, and wonder ing as I built which voice Avas the sweeter \u2014 hers or Therese's, and which of the two I really loved the best. Thinking of Therese, I began to fancy I could hear her light step on the landing out side, a heavier one following it. I put down the brick in my hand and listened intently ; and now I distinctly heard a low, sweet, mocking laugh and a scuffle ; then a cry of anger.

She was laughing, showing all her Avhite teeth and dimples as she pushed him from her, yet for all that she was in a furious passion, her eyes flashing and her bodice rising and falling like the waves of an angry sea. ' Has he been beating you ? ' I repeated in my wisdom and knoAvledge of human nature, and I ran to stroke her red cheek and lay my OAvn against it. ' Yes, he has, he has !

For young gentlemen like you,"], [306, "296 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE brought up to think the Avorld was made for 'em, do a sight o' wickedness, and cause such misery all along o' thoughtlessness, as might make the angels in heaven weep to think on ; but so far as we are concerned it might ha' been worse. My maiden's heart is broke, but there is no stain upon her honour.' ' I never had a thought concerning her that was not as pure as herself,' I interrupted. ' Ah, sir,' said William, ' deeds is like words ; they spring up we hardly knows how, and are aAvful, unalterable facts before we had quite shaped 'em into thoughts. The road to sin is like the road down our glaciers \u2014 soft and smooth and easy. We slide down, down, faster and faster, and there we are over the precipice, lost for ever, before we had even seen to Avhat we were driving.' I hung my head, and William went on : ' There's a deal in bringin' up, sir, and maybe if I'd been brought up as badly as you"], [307, "'DOWN TO PENZANCE' 297 I might ha' been no better. But, thank God, I wasn't. Sin was made hard to me, sir. I'll tell you just a little story out o' my life, and let it be a warning to you. ' I were born in Cornwall, down to Penzance \u2014 maybe you've heard tell o' Penzance \u2014 and my mother were a Wesleyan. I used to go with her to Gwennap Pit to hear Wesley preach, and I never forgot it. We lived in a almshouse, for my father were dead \u2014 he died before I can remember. ' There was a old Quaker gentleman who lived near Penzance, and my mother had been a servant in his fam'ly \u2014 'twas he who got her into the almshouse, Avhere we was very com fortable. He lived in a curious old house ; it had been a cottage and had got added to, here a room and there a room, as they was wanted. This house stood in the most beautiful garden you can imagine. I've seen heaps of gardens, but never one like that ; and as for flowers"], [308, "298 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE and fruit, there never was any hke them in that garden down to Penzance. ' Well, I used to do a day's weeding noAv and then in this garden, and one day I was Avorking there, and the strawberries was ripe and the day Avas very hot, and as I worked the smell of 'em came towards me so sweet and temptin', and I couldn't help thinkin' about 'em. ' Now I had been brought up honest. My mother used to say 'twas all one whether you stole a pin or a sovereign, and I never before thought o' tastin' unless some was given to me. But it was hot and I was dry, and my eyes kept wanderin' to the strawberries and to one in particklar. There was such heaps on 'em. ' \" Thou shalt not steal,\" something seemed to say in my ear. 'But I was so dry. Well, I would go and get a drink of water. ' There was two ways to the well. One led"], [309, "'DOWN TO PENZANCE 299 right through the strawberries ; the other way was longer round. ' I knew Avhich way I ought to take very Avell, but somethin' else seemed to say that I was a doAvnright coward ; that 'twas a heap braver to go into the thick o' temptation than to run away from it, and I listened to this second voice. I didn't drive it away. I listened to it. ' Oh, sir, that ain't true courage. Them as go in pride of heart to the brink o' tempta tion have no call to wonder if they fall over.' He sighed deeply, then went on : ' Well, sir, I hadn't listened long before I acted. I went through the strawberries, and before I had taken a dozen steps my eyes seemed forced to look at 'em, and I saw one \u2014 oh, so big and ripe and juicy ! \u2014 and my hand seemed forced to take. What can you expect ? When you hsten to the devil, he soon teaches you that he is a heap cleverer than you are."], [310, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 300 ' So I stooped and picked, and before I knew rightly what I were doing I had one at my mouth. ' Then something occurred for Avhich I have thanked God ever since, though then I thought I'd rather have died than had it happen. Somebody grasped me by the collar, and I looked up into the eyes of the master ' And the straAvberry, untasted. fell from my lips. ' I've seen a many kind faces since the old man died, sir, but I never saw a kinder. Folk has told me since that for all he was a simple Quaker gentleman, he was full of knoAvledge as well as love, and that many people in the great world knew and honoured him. But whatever he did for others, I knoAV this, that he saved me, and that I shall bless him for it as long as I live. ' I think I see him noAv, in his broad-"], [311, "'DOWN TO PENZANCE' 301 brimmed Quaker hat and knee-breeches ; he Avas rayther short and stout, but looked such a true gentleman as I never saw since. You'd ha' trusted him only to look at him, for there wasn't a harsh line in his face, and his grey eyes, with their bushy white eyebrows, were as kind as they were keen. But I'd rayther anyone in the world had found me steahng than him or my mother. '\"Boy,\" he said, \" what art thou doing? \" ' \" 'Twas the first one, sir,\" I stammered. ' \" How many apples dost thou think Eve ate before it was sin ? \" ' I sobbed aloud as he asked the question. ' \" Now I want to make sin so hard to thee that thou wilt never want to try it ao-ain,\" he said. \" What had I better do \u2014 flog thee myself or take thee home to thy mother ? \" ' \" Oh, sir,\" I said, \" flog me yourself, but don't tell my mother.\""], [312, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 302 ' \" I think I must,\" he said. \" I have no right to deceive her, and besides, if she's the Dorothy of old, she'd never think it was properly done unless she did it herself.\" ' That was so true that I could not say another word. Everybody who knew my mother knew that. She had never struck me in her life, but I knew if I had to be struck she would a heap rayther do it herself, and that she'd be sure to do it thorough. ' So I was marched out through the beautiful garden to my home in the alms house, Avhere my mother sat knitting. She looked up amazed as our shadows fell over her ; then after a few words from my master looked alone at me. ' Sir, I never needed to be told again Avhat steahng only a strawberry meant to her. And my master let go of my collar to take her hand, saying, in a voice that sounded as if tears had got into it, \" Dorothy, if I"], [313, "'DOWN TO PENZANCE' 303 had known I would have kept it from thee.\" ' I got my flogging, of course, and no light one neither, but 'twas nothing, nothing after that look. When I went back to my work the next day, I had to go and ask my master to forgive me. He lifted up my chin and looked steadily into my eyes. ' \" Now, my son,\" he said, \" remember next time thou art tempted that there's a flogging at the end of it.\" ' \" Yes, sir,\" I answered, \" and my mother.\" ' Well,' continued William, looking hard at me, ' it were bore in upon me that, maybe, 'twere something with you as with me and the strawberry \u2014 you didn't know what road you was going on.

' What about the straAv berry ? ' he repeated, ' what about it ? ' He did not know that he would have puzzled all the sages and divines the world ever heard of by that simple question.
