For the scripture expressly declares \u2014 \" And King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is be side Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to King Solomon.\" (1 Kings, ix. 26.) And since Ophir and Sheba are the names of two bro thers, who inhabited countries in the east, and we may conclude in the vicinity of each other, the immediate result, as might naturally be expected, was, that \" When the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of"], [22, "6 ILLUSTRATIONS OF Solomon, concerning the name of the Lord, she came to prove him with hard questions.

And she gave the king a hun dred and twenty talents of gold ; and of spices very great store, and precious stones ; there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.\" (Ib. 3-13.) In another portion of scripture, the same circumstances are thus related, \u2014 \" Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber and to Eloth, at the sea-side, in the land of Edom.

From these accounts it is plainly apparent that the voyages to Ophir comprised the cause of the visit paid by this celebrated queen to the court of Solomon. Few historical questions have received more discussion, and none, in my opinion, more needlessly, than the situation of the ancient Aus er, or Ophir, as this name is spelt in our version of the scriptures.

Yet a consideration of circum stances will testify this fact merely to com prehend one in the numerous list of remark able analogies subsisting in name between places discovered in the eastern islands and others on the African continent. Of this undoubted and very curious truth, two ex amples will for the present suffice. 1st. Mataram is the name of one of the most ancient kingdoms of Java ; and this is a compound term, importing mata, the eye, and eare, day \u2014 the eye of the day; a metaphor denoting the sun. But the same * Notes to 1 Kings, ix. 28."], [27, "11 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. appellation, comprising the same identical meaning, is perceived in the ancient Egyptian name Mature, translated by the Greeks He liopolis, City of the Sun ; that is also the meaning of Surya Carta, or Solo, the prin cipal city of the kingdom of Mataram in Java. This coincidence is rendered the more striking, because, in Egypt, upon the opposite bank of the Nile from Matare, near Cairo, we find in the maps the name of a city Carca Soora, but which, I confidently think, is or was Carta Sura, which does not in any respect differ from the Javanese appellation. To Matarea it is asserted our Saviour re tired, when, in consequence of the edict passed by Herod for the destruction of the infants, he was conveyed by Joseph into Egypt."], [28, "12 ILLUSTRATIONS OF Chemnitrus (out of Stipulinsis, who had it from Peter Martyr, bishop of Alexa?idria, in the third century) says, that \" the place in Egypt where Christ was banished is now called Matarea, about ten miles beyond Cairo; that the inhabitants constantly burn a lamp in remembrance of it ; and that there is a garden of trees, yielding a balsam, which were planted by Christ when a boy.\"* The passages allu ded to are as follow : \u2014 \" They went to that sicamore-tree which is called matarea. And in Matarea the Lord Jesus caused a well to spring forth.\" \u2014 \" Near to that idol was the inn of the city, into which when Joseph and Saint Mary were come and had turned into that inn, all the inhabitants of the city * Hone's Apociyphal New Testament\u2014 Preface."], [29, "13 ancient geography. were astonished. And all the magistrates and priests of the idols assembled before that idol, and made inquiry there, saying, what means all this consternation and dread which has fallen upon all our country ? The idol answered them, the Unknown God is come hither who is truly God, nor is there any one besides him who is worthy of di vine worship, for he is truly the Son of God. At the fame of him this country trembled, and at his coming it is under the present commotion and consternation, and we our selves are affrighted by the greatness of his power. And at the same instant this idol fell down, and at his fall all the inhabitants of Egypt, besides others, ran together.\"* It hence follows that the city of Matarea * First Gospel of Infancy, viii. 9."], [30, "14 ILLUSTRATIONS OF must have constituted one of the chief seats of idolatry in Egypt; and that there was established the worship of Alata-era, \" the eye of the day,\" or Si-eare, originally Si-ur, \" the great fire,\" the illustrious solar light. I will here note that in Sanskrit Surya is the sun, and in the Hindu mythology the name of the solar god, or regent. Such, likewise, was exactly the case in Java; because it is within the precincts of Mataram not only that the site of Suria Carta, \" the city of the sun,\" is discovered, but that there are likewise found abounding the extensive ruins of Brambanan, originally comprehending a prodigious number of edi fices entirely devoted to the solar supersti tion, precisely as it appears to have been practised within the Egyptian temples."], [31, "15 ancient geography. 2d. The second instance which I shall ad duce in support of this fact is, the appella tion Djiocarta, or Augecarta, or Yugecarta, names of the metropolis of the present sultan of Mataram.

But the information communicated in this passage by Moses, undoubtedly overthrows the opinion that Ophir is to be found oppo- site to Madagascar, ( Madeo-carta, the city of Madeva, or, more classically, Maha- deva,) on the south-eastern coast of Africa.

The sentiments entertained by Mr. Bruce have consequently encountered strong op position; for Dr. Vincent observes, \" I by no means subscribe to the system of Bruce, which he has displayed with so much inge nuity and ostentation ; and which he thinks established by the discovery of an anoma lous monsoon prevailing from Sofala to Me- c"], [34, "18 ILLUSTRATIONS OF linda.

They had no factors to whom they could consign a cargo in the gross, or who could furnish them, on the emergence, with a lading in return ; but they anchored in a harbour, where they were their own brokers, and disposed of their cargo by re tail.

Now Moses tells us, that Ophir, in common with the other sons of Joktan, settled far to the east. The voyage, therefore, from the Red Sea to the land of Ophir must have been made in an eastern direction. But the whole sea-coast of Persia, as far as the Indus, was inha- * An.

It would appear, from this passage, that a general tradition regarding the gold of Ophir had prevailed from the earliest ages. By the later Roman and Grecian writers we are informed, that a district in the east actually obtained the appellation of Aufrea, (or, abbreviated, Aurea) Chersonesus; the Gold coast, or Golden peninsula : Ophir, or Aus er, and Aurum, i. e. gold, being apparently the same word, or at least derivatives of one"], [38, "22 ILLUSTRATIONS OF root \u2014 Mr-fire, the solar luminary.

This point, which has no name in Ptolemy, M. d'Anville has, with great propriety, fixed at Gordaware, a cape near the mouth of the river Godavery, and from which it seems to take its title.\"* By Dr. Robertson we are further informed, \" that the peninsula to which Ptolemy gives the name of the Golden Chersonesus, he delineates as if it * An.

Now, the reason is ob vious ; and by means of a slight reflection upon the manner in which these topics have hitherto been handled, we shall not only arrive at a conclusion which affords a ready solution of the strange incredulity accompa nying the facts recorded by Ptolemy ; but which vindicates the general accuracy of that writer, and serves also to establish the"], [41, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 25 correctness of the situations assigned by me to places fixed by him, in countries lying far to the south and eastward of the Ganges.

Now we have said thus much, that nobody may be ignorant of the difference between those sorts of wood, nor unac quainted with the nature of the genuine pine tree ; and we thought it both a seasonable and humane thing when we mentioned it, and the uses the king made of it, to explain this difference so far as we have done.

If it be urged that Moses also states Sheba to have been the son of Rama, and grandson of Cush, (Ib. x. 7,) and, therefore, that it is impossible to ascer tain whether the Queen was a descendant of the former or latter patriarch ; it may be answered, that the dominions of both the Shebas appear to have been placed some where in India or the Eastern Islands.

Whereas, he tells us that the ancient name of Meroe, before the time of Cambyses, was Sheba : for this he seems to want au thority ; since Diodorus and other histo rians represent this city as built new from"], [55, "39 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. the ground, and not repaired by Camby- SES.* By Wiiiston, also, the opinion of the Jewish historian is thus opposed : \" That this Queen of Sheba was a Queen of Sab\u0153a in South Arabia; and not of Egypt and Ethiopia, as Josephus here asserts, is, I suppose, now generally agreed : and since Sab\u0153a is well known to be a country near the sea, in the south of Arabia Felix, which lay south from Judea also ; and since our Saviour calls the Queen the Queen of the South, and says she came from the ut most parts of the earth, (Matt. xii. 12, Luke, xi. 35,) which description agrees better to this Arabia than to Egypt and Ethiopia, there is little occasion for doubt ing in this matter.\"^ * Hist, of the Bible, ii. 79-1. f Note, vol. i. p. 428."], [56, "40 ILLUSTRATIONS OF The opinion of Josephus being found so untenable, with regard to the situation of Sheba, it appears to me that there remains but one mode of determining the country from whence proceeded the Princess who visited Jerusalem; and this consists in pay ing strict attention to the meaning of the expressions delivered by our Saviour. This authority, the highest of which we can form a conception, who shall presume to ques tion ? He positively states her to have been a Queen of the south, who came from the ut termost parts of the earth. The description, as given in scripture, is extremely forcible : \" The Queen of the South shall rise up in the judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it : for she came from the ut termost parts of the earth to hear the wis dom of Solomon ; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.\" And again, in"], [57, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 41 Luke : \" The Queen of the South shall rise up in the judgement with the men of this generation and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.\" In the Greek, the words in both these pas sages are the same \u2014 sx tuv \u25a0n-tpu.rw rr\\c yr\\c \u2014 \" from the boundaries of the earth ;\" \u2014 but this is an expression, that, in the days of Augustus C\u00e6sar, the time our Lord ap peared, could not be applied either to Egpyt, Ethiopia, or Arabia ; because, as we find in the following extracts from Harris's Collection of Voyages, neither of those coun tries formed, at that period, the limits of the known world. \" When Augustus had settled his government at Rome, and obtained, in a legal way, the supreme authority over the empire, he began to think of visiting the"], [58, "42 ILLUSTRATIONS OF East, where he had many things to settle ; and accordingly, in the tenth year of his administration, and in the twenty-first before Christ, having devolved on Agrippa the affairs of the West, Augustus went as far as the island Samos, in his journey east ward ; and there he passed the winter. While he was at Samos, came the embassa dors from Candace, queen of Ethiopia, to excuse what happened in that country, and to beg a peace, which he granted them very readily ; and the embassadors returned into their own country full of amazement at the sight of the power and glory of the Roman prince. And it was owing, in all proba bility, to their report, on their return home, that a firm peace ensued between the Ethio pians and Romans in the province of Egypt, which subsisted for many years. The next year Augustus went into Syria, settled the"], [59, "43 ANCIENT geography. affairs of the empire with the Parthian monarch, and recovered the ensigns which he had taken from Crassus.\" \" This spread the fame of Augustus over all the East; insomuch, that Porus, king of India on this side the Ganges, who had before sent an embassy to compliment him, thought proper now to send a second time, from an apprehension, probably, that Au gustus might imitate Alexander, and attempt to penetrate as far as the Indus. Of these embassadors only three lived to execute their commission. And finding Augustus at Antioch, they there delivered to him the letters of King Porus.\" \" It is very clear, from the whole of this transac tion, that the fame of Augustus had ex tended itself into the most distant parts of the East that were at that time known to the"], [60, "44 ILLUSTRATIONS OF Europeans; and from hence it is evident that the trade carried on from Egypt to those countries through the Red Sea, instead of being interrupted or restrained, was pre served and protected by the Romans after they had reduced Egypt into a province.\"* But the information contained in this passage extends the boundaries of the world, as known to the ancients, far beyond the limits of Arabia ; and Dr. Robertson, in regard to the information conveyed by Ptolemy, as already noticed, affirms, \" To the east of this peninsula he places what he calls the Great Bay, and in the most remote part of it the station of Catigara, the utmost boundary of navigation in ancient times ; to which he assigns no less than eight degrees * Vol. i. 428."], [61, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 45 and a half of southern latitude. Beyond this he declares the earth to be altogether unknown.\" Again, \u2014 \" he mentions one inland city, to which he gives the name of Thin\u00e6, or Sin\u00e6 Metropolis. The longitude which he assigns to it is one hundred and eighty degrees from his first meridian in the Fortunate Island, and is the utmost point towards the east to which the ancients had advanced by sea.\" But since Catagara is to the eastward of the Golden Chersonesus, and eight degrees south of the line, and Tinct Metropolis is in its neighbourhood, it follows that they refer to places situated upon the island of Java ; and hence, as the one is declared to be \" the utmost boundary of navigation in ancient times,\" and the other \" the utmost point towards the East to which the ancients"], [62, "46 ILLUSTRATIONS OF had advanced by sea,\" it is as clearly proved that in the first century they formed the per ata tees gees; and thus of the words of our Saviour, although unconsciously, a literal translation is given by Dr. Robert- son. If thus the \" boundaries of the earth,\" in the south-east, be fixed to the island of Java, we must also, of necessity, conclude from that island the Queen of Sheba proceeded ; and in Java, and Java only, her dominions are to be sought. Attention to other passages of scripture will elucidate the same fact. We are informed by Daniel, (ch. ii.) in the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's pro phetic dream, that four empires, or powers, were in succession to make their appearance in the world, each conquering its prede cessor, and the whole circumscribed within"], [63, "47 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. the form of an immense image. Now this image, comprising within itself the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires, of course includes the limits of the world as known to the ancients ; and it is remarkable that no European power of any consequence has extended much to the eastward of the boundaries of the ancient Ba bylonian empire. For Ahasuerus, a prince of the second empire, which is declared to be inferior, or more circumscribed in its limits, to the dominions of Nebuchadnez zar, (v. 39,) is said to have \" reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces.\" (Esther, i. 1.) But if the image included within itself the boundaries of the ancient world, then the per ata tees gees, and the termination of the image, are co-incident ; and both fixed at Catigara, to the eastward and south-"], [64, "48 ILLUSTRATIONS OF ward of the Aurea Chersonesus, in the island of Java. Accordingly, we find beyond this parallel of longitude, the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, nearly unknown to Europeans, and to the subjects either of the ancient or modern Roman empire ; and that, on the continent, the nations eastward of Hindoostan have constantly, resolutely, and successively withstood all attempts at the introduction of European and even Mussul- man power. The Queen of Sheba must, therefore, have come from the boundaries of the image, or of the earth, in the southward ; and these, as we have seen, were placed at Catigara; comprehending an emporium, or sea-port, on the island of Java. She was, conse quently, either Queen of the whole of that island, or a Princess of one of the fertile"], [65, "49 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. districts, which are there abounding. Fur ther, all circumstances connected with the relation of her journey unite in proving that Java formed the site of her kingdom. For it has been shown that Sheba, wherever it was placed, is to be sought in the vicinity of Ophir ; and that information communi cated from Ophir to Sheba was the cause of the Queen's visit to the metropolis of Judea. But Ophir is the gold district of Sumatra ; and Java, consequently corre sponds with the situation we have assigned to Sheba. In additional illustration of the identity of Sheba and Java, it is to be noticed, that Jobab was also a son of Joktan ; who had his portion likewise in the east, in the neigh- Jbourhood of Ophir ; and this appellation, E"], [66, "50 ILLUSTRATIONS OF nearly literally, is expressed in the Jabadi* of Ptolemy, which also existed close to the Aurea Chersonesus. But the name of Jobab is lost in scripture, as the name of a country; and probably because Sheba, in the neighbourhood of the dominions of Jo bab, was found to be a name more conso nant for Hebrew pronunciation. In fact, Sheba, Jobab, Jabadie, and Java, exhibit, simply, variations of the same word. For the sheen, y} , of the Hebrew alphabet, by a gradual hardening of the sound, becomes the j of modern languages. Thus 'jpjjj , Shekel, in Arabic becomes Joti Thuckle; and th, we know have the power of d; as in murther and murder ; while d, followed by * May not this name be also traced in the Jambi districts of Sumatra ?"], [67, "51 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. a vowel, is pronounced j ; whence diurnus, or diurnal, is converted into journal. Hence similar permutations, depending upon the connexion subsisting between the letters s, h, and j, will naturally cause an amalga mation in sound between the Java, Jaba, and Zaba, of Ptolemy, and Sheba. While the name becomes in this manner identified with Java, the products of Sheba not less accurately correspond with those of the islands to the eastward of Sumatra. For Ezekiel declares \" that the merchants of Sheba trafficked in the markets of Tyre with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones and gold.\" The Queen of Sheba is also said to have presented Solomon with \" an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store, and precious stones ; there came no more such abundance e2"], [68, "52 ILLUSTRATIONS OF of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.\" And again \u2014 \" She came to Jerusalem with camels that bare spices in abundance, and she gave the King of spices in great abundance, neither was there any such spice as the Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.\" Vincent imagines Ophir and Sheba to have been both in Arabia; but yet he is compelled to admit that \" spices, although they are taxed, are never mentioned as an article of importation from Ophir,\" and he allows that \" it is particularly added, that the royal visitant brought a present of spices.\" \" There were no such spices as the Queen of Sheba gave to Solomon.\"* A marked distinction is thus perceived ex- * An. Com. ii. 226."], [69, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 53 isting between the staple commodities of Ophir and Sheba ; the former consisting of gold, and the latter of spice. But this is universally known to be the fact in regard to Sumatra and Java ; no gold being found in Java, save what happens to be brought from Sumatra or the neighbouring islands : while Java is fertile in pepper and other spices, of which it has been a principal mart in all ages. We shall, therefore, in vain look for any country that in name, geogra phical position, and nature of its products, agrees with the ancient Sheba, excepting the present island of Java. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this event is, that this journey, or embassy, was executed by an enterprizing woman ; whose chief motive, as she herself candidly"], [70, "54 ILLUSTRATIONS OF admits, was curiosity. For \" she said to the King, it was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts, and of thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not the words until I came and mine eyes had seen it ; and behold the half was not told me. Thy wis dom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.\" Now the power conferred in the eastern islands, upon females of rank, and their inquisitive disposition, is forcibly illustrated in the accounts of the queens of Acheen, as delivered to us by Mr. Mars den. That excellent and accurate histo rian observes : \" The people now being accustomed and reconciled to female rule, which they found more lenient than that of their kings, acquiesced in general in the es tablished mode of government ; and she was immediately succeeded by another female"], [71, "55 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. monarch, named Nar-al-alum, who reigned little more than twenty years, and died in 1677. \" The Queen who succeeded her was named Anayet Shah. In the year 1684, she received an embassy from the English government of Madras ; and appeared at that time to be about forty years old.\" In a note, the same writer communicates the following illustration of the feature in the female character to which I have al luded. It appears to have existed in as full force in the seventeenth century, amongst the princesses of the Eastern Islands, as in the days of Solomon. The follow ing curious passage is extracted from the journal of these gentlemen's proceedings. \" We went to give our attendance at the"], [72, "56 ILLUSTRATIONS OF palace this day as customary. Being ar rived at the place of audience with the Orang Cayos, the Queen was pleased to order us to come nearer ; when her majesty was very inquisitive into the use of our wearing periwigs, and what was the conve nience of them ; to all which we returned satisfactory answers. After this her majesty desired of Mr. Ord, if it were no affront to him, that he would take off his periwig, that she might see how he appeared with out it; which, according to her majesty's request, he did. She then told us, she had heard of our business, and would give her answer by the OrangCayos, and so we retired.\" These facts serve to throw considerable light upon the share which females, in all ages, appear to have taken* in the political transactions of the Eastern Islands ; but the-"], [73, "57 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. intriguing and enterprizing disposition of the Princesses of Java is distinctly visible in the following quotations, so illustrative of the positions I am desirous of establishing. They are taken from Crawfurd's History of the Indian Archipelago. \" A. S. 1508, A.D. 1586. The principal object of the reign of this prince was the subjugation of the Eastern districts ; and in this he suc ceeded as far as Pati, towards the North Coast, and Kadari, towards the South. He made predatory incursions as far as Pasur han ; but not a permanent conquest. Of the manner in which the war was conducted I shall offer a few specimens. The Prince of Mataram having made an expedition to the east, was opposed by the confederated chiefs of Madura and Java, and used the following stratagem to disengage the two first of the confederates that opposed his"], [74, "58 ILLUSTRATIONS OF progress, the Princes of Madiyon and Pro norogo. He selected a beautiful woman of the highest rank, and sent her as his ambas sador to the Prince of Madiyon; who, by the way, affected the habits and life of a devotee. The Chief of Mataram called him of Madiyon, \" Father ;\" which is equivalent, by the customs of Java, to tendering sub mission, and acknowledging dependence or inferiority. The lady was particularly in structed to resist no solicitation of the prince. She obeyed her instructions, and by her blandishments seduced him from his alliance. The Senopayti, meanwhile, at tacked the Prince of Pronorogo, and sur prised him with two hundred chosen horse, led by himself in person ; after which suc cess, without any further ceremony, he fell upon the Prince of Madiyon, and obtained an easy victory. This chieftain, flying from"], [75, "59 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. his palace with his family, left his favourite daughter behind him as a decoy to his anta gonist ; and this lady was afterwards married to the Prince of Mataram.\"* \" I shall give,\" says Crawfurd, \" one other anecdote of this reign, and chiefly because it affords a cu rious illustration of the female character in the highest rank of life. A similar example has not, indeed, been often afforded in Java, though there the women claim a degree of equality with the stronger sex not often seen in the East ; but frequent instances are afforded of female heroism among the more warlike, ferocious, and uncivilized, tribes of Celebes. In the year 1550 of Salivana, (A. D. 1628,) the Sultan attacked Giri, the residence of the spiritual chief of that name, and the descendant of one of the most conspicuous of * Vol. ii. p. 324."], [76, "60 ILLUSTRATIONS OF the first apostles of Mahomedanism ; and sub dued it after an obstinate struggle. He was probably induced to disregard the holy cha racter of this person from resentment for the advice he had given to the eastern chiefs, and their invasion of Mataram. \" The command of the troops for this enterprise was entrusted to the Prince of Surabya, now affianced to the Sultan by a marriage with his daughter, the Princess Wandan Sat~i. The Priest of Giri made a gallant defence, and in a rencontre defeated his adversary, whose fortunes were retrieved by the spirit of his heroic consort. This Princess presented herself before the troops accoutred as a warrior ; spoke of the bravery of her ancestors ; harangued the soldiers \u2022 distributed gifts to them, and put herself at their head. Encouraged by her example,."], [77, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 61 the troops renewed the attack ; captured the temple and mausoleum of Giri, and took the Susanan and his family prisoners. The daughters of Javaneese Princes, when mar ried to subjects, assume a tone and insist on privileges unknown to their sex in the East. The husband in such a case fre quently terms the wife \" mistress ;\" addresses her in the language appropriated to cere mony, and cannot marry a second wife, or keep a concubine. The Ratit Wandam claimed and maintained this ascendancy over her husband.\" (Ib. p. 332.) It was generally understood, that the in subordination which occurred amongst the British troops in Java, in the year 1815, originated in the intrigues set on foot by the Ratoo, or wife of the Susanan, for the establishment of her son, by a former hus-"], [78, "62 ILLUSTRATIONS OF band, upon the throne of Djocjocarta ; and it is probable that in no country has female influence been more frequently exerted than in Java and the neighbouring islands. In all the markets of Java the occupation of merchants is performed by women ; and that they formerly partook even of the mili tary character is evident from this fact \u2014 that the persons of the ruling sovereigns are confided to the care of armed women, who surround their throne upon occasions of state, and act in the capacity of the royal troops, to whom the charge of the monarch's person is given in other countries. A review of these circumstances will, therefore, lead to the conclusion, that in a direction south oi Jerusalem, to the Eastern islands only, we are to look for a princess who could, on her own account, perform such a journey as is attributed to the Queen of Sheba."], [79, "63 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. Another circumstance deserving notice is the mortification which the Shebaneese Prin cess experienced at beholding the magnifi cence of Solomon ; for, when \" the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his ser vants, and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord; there was no more spirit in her.\" But it is difficult to conceive to what cause these dispiriting feelings could be assigned, unless a contrast had been drawn by this Princess between the grandeur of Sheba and the splendour of Jerusalem; and the consciousness, unex pected by herself, of the lustre of her own country being obscured by the glories of Solomon's court ; by reason of which she"], [80, "64 ILLUSTRATIONS OF was obliged, in astonishment, to exclaim, \" it was a true report that I heard, in mine own land, of thy acts and of thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it ; and, be hold, the half was not told me ! Thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth thy fame which I heard.\" These remarks strikingly corre spond with the observations we may suppose would have fallen from a Javaneese of rank, who, by motives of incredulity regarding the wisdom of Solomon, and the magnifi cence of his court, had been led to verify the report by means of personal observation. Because, over the whole of Java are found abundant traces of the intelligence of its former inhabitants, and the magnificence of the cities it contained- In consequence of no dates earlier than"], [81, "65 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. the 13th century of Salivana having been discovered on the Java monuments, it is, I am aware, imagined that those ruins do not extend to the remote antiquity which I am willing to ascribe to them ; yet it is admitted by Crawfurd that the eastern islands and Java were known to Ptolemy, as he sup poses, through the medium of Hindoos, at a period long anterior to the earliest date that has been discovered in any of the temples or other monuments of antiquity. (Ib. iii. 190.) \" Thus,\" observes Crawfurd, \" two zodiacal copper cups, in my possession, discovered at no great distance from Kaderi or Doho, which contains important Hindoo relics, and was one of the chief seats of Hindoo worship, have inscribed upon them, in plain figures, the one the year 1241, and F"], [82, "66 ILLUSTRATIONS OF the other 1246 ; and in the collection of Sir Stamford Raffles is one brought from Doho with the year 1220. I have never seen nor heard of any earlier dates that could be relied upon.\" (Ib. ii. 215.) And he then determines that \" it is satisfactory to find how well these dates correspond with the more recent, and, therefore rea sonably, the more authentic, dates recorded in the memorial verses. Joyoboyo, King of Doho, is there said to have flourished in 1 ] 17 of Salivana; the earliest of the temples of Prambanan to have been constructed in 1188; the most recent in 1218; and the temple of Boro Budar in 1260.\" The inference drawn from these dates is not, however, entirely consistent with in formation derived from other quarters : for we find Sir Stamford Raffles observing,"], [83, "67 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. \" The temples at Brambanan (the extensive remains of which, with the numerous casts in metal found in their vicinity, prove the high state which the arts had attained, in a remote age, and afford incontestible evi dence of the establishment of the Hindu worship in the earliest periods of Javan history) are stated in some accounts to have been constructed in the year 525, and in others in the year 1018 ; but, as far as the general tradition may be relied on, it seems most probable that they were the works of the sixth or seventh centuries.\"* Here, then, we observe, that in the Java accounts themselves, upon which so much stress appears to have been laid by Crawfurd, a difference of no less than 500 years occurs in the dates assigned to the erection of the * Hist, of Java, vol. ii. f 2"], [84, "68 ILLUSTRATIONS OF edifices, whose ruins have been discovered on that island. And we learn further, from Sir S. Raffles, that \" many of these Princes, with their descendants, are, in the traditionary accounts of the country, be lieved to have established themselves on Java; and while we find Tritresta founding a colony in the first year of the Javan era, or about seventeen hundred and forty years ago, it is the less surprising that the war of the Pandus should have been transferred from the Dwapara Yoga to the present age, and believed to have taken place in Java, about twelve hundred years ago.\"* \" The following account of princes, commenc ing with Tritresta, who is believed to have established his government at Giling Wesi, at the foot of the mountain Se Miru, * Hist, of Java, vol, ii. p. 72."], [85, "69 ANCIENT geography. with the dynasties which they severally esta blished, and the dates at which they respec tively succeeded to the government, while it shows the manner in which these islanders have interwoven their fabulous history with that of the continent, will prove how little credit is due to those accounts which furnish local details during a period so remote and obscure.\" (Ib. p. 73.) It appears, from this paragraph, that no dependence can be placed upon Javanese accounts, regarding the ancient history of the country ; and by Mr. Crawfurd it is admitted, that inscriptions have been dis covered of a character totally different from those contained in the dates mentioned above ; for he observes, \" The ancient in scriptions found in Java are of four kinds : 1. Sanskrit inscriptions in the Devanagari"], [86, "70 ILLUSTRATIONS OF character. 2. Inscriptions in the ancient Javanese, or Kawi. 3. Inscriptions in an antiquated but barbarous form of the pre sent Javanese. And, 4. Inscriptions which cannot be deciphered, and are, probably, the characters in which the Sunda was writ ten. A very few inscriptions only are found in Devanagari ; and these are confined to the two most distinguished remains of Hin duism on Java, Brambanan, and Singhasari. Colonel Mackenzie, in 1811, discovered a long inscription of this sort at Brambanan, upon a stone, more than six feet long, in the form of a tomb-stone. In 1815, I found, myself, another, exactly of the same de scription ; and a third, of smaller size, was discovered, in the same year, by Dr. Tytler. Besides these, smaller inscriptions, consisting of a few words, or at most of a few lines, have been found, chiefly at Singhasari, and"], [87, "71 ANCIENT geography. commonly on the stone images of the prin cipal objects of worship. I have one in brass, in my own possession, on the back of a figure of Budhu; found near Brambanan. No translations of any of these inscriptions have been effected.\"* \" Of the fourth and last class of inscriptions not much can be said. They cannot be translated, and are, in fact, in an unknown character. They are all found in the country of the Sundas.\" (Vol. ii. p. 218.) But it is clear that inscriptions of this kind receive no light from the dates intel ligible to the modern Javanese; and to infer, as is done by Crawfurd, that \" they prove a few genuine Hindus have been among the founders of the principal temples, but that * Hist, of the Indian Archipelago, ii. 212."], [88, "72 ILLUSTRATIONS OF they were not the most numerous body of the priesthood at the time, and that Sanskrit was not the usual language consecrated to religion, (p. 212,) conveys an assumption as gratuitous, and, indeed, as erroneous, as it would be to conclude that the inscrip tion in the ancient Hindu character, upon the granite pillar at Allahabad, is coeval with the modern Arabian letters which are cut upon the same monument of antiquity. But Java, as is allowed by Crawfurd, was known to Ptolemy, many centuries anterior to the dates which he imagines to explain the foundation of the ancient edifices abounding in the island ; and he even af firms that Java, at that period, was the richest and most distinguished country of the Archipelago, and the principal seat of Hinduism."], [89, "73 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. \" The first direct mention made of any portion of the Archipelagos according to Mr. Crawfurd, is by the geographer Ptolemy, about the middle of the second century. Two names are distinctly men tioned in his map which are unequivocally native, viz. Malay u, and Jaba, Java, or Java, which are all synonymous. The word Malayu has appended to it the term of Kolon, and Din, or Dib. Malayu and Java, it is already sufficiently known, are the names of the two great countries, or, rather, the two great tribes, of the West. \" I shall presume to make a few observa tions on each, endeavouring to illustrate the subject by an application of the more accu rate knowledge of those countries, and their inhabitants, which has been acquired of late years."], [90, "74 ILLUSTRATIONS OF \" I think that the great geographer, or, rather, those from whom he had his in formation, must have had the notices in question directly from Hindus; and these, again, from the people of Java particularly. The word Kolon is, without any alteration, Javanese; and means the ' West.' The com pound word Malayu-Kolon, exactly in the order in which it stands, means ' Malays of the West.' The Javanese must, therefore, (the inference is in all probability) have furnished the information in question ; and the term West has, probably, reference to the geographical position of some one tribe of Malays in relation to others ; for, to this day, the original Malays are divided into several distinct tribes, according to their geographical situation. The people of Java, when interrogated, would, at all events,"], [91, "75 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. have called any Malays ' people of the West ;' and, indeed, do so now. \" There is an unanswerable objection against supposing Malayu-Kolon to be on the Malayan peninsula; or supposing this last to be the golden Chersonesus (or Khreese) at all ; which will occur at once to every one familiar with the well-known history of the Malays. It is this : \u2014 In the age of Ptolemy, and for many ages after it, the Malayan peninsula was uninhabited, or inhabited only by a few negro savages, re sembling the cannibals oi Andaman; wretched beings with whom there could have been no intercourse, or at least no commerce. The Malays did not emigrate from Sumatra, their parent country, and settle in the Malayan peninsula, until the comparatively modern period of the year 1160, a thousand years"], [92, "76 ILLUSTRATIONS OF after the time of Ptolemy ; while Malacca was not founded until 1252 : and every other Malay state on the peninsala is of still more recent foundation. \" The term Dib, or Diu, appended to Java, and meaning country or island, is pure Sanskrit, and happens not to be a word of that language ever used, that I am aware of, in any of the dialects of the Archipelago. It is fair, from this, to argue, that those who used the term in describing Java to the merchants of the West, were not natives of Java, or of any portion of the Archipelago ; but Hindus, or natives of India; and, which is the same thing, that Ptolemy's informa tion was not obtained through the direct in tercourse of Europeans with the country. If any names at all reached Europeans correctly, we cannot be surprised that those should be"], [93, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 77 the names of the two principal tribes or countries. This is especially applicable to Java, the richest and most distinguished country of the Archipelago, and the prin cipal seat of Hinduism. We have seen that it is the only name mentioned in Chinese works ; and, among the Arabs, such is its reputation, that they designate the whole Archipelago and all its inhabitants by it. \" Whether he obtained his information from Chinese or Arabs, Java was the most important name, also, which reached the ears of Marco Polo. He was six months in Sumatra, without ever hearing any name for it; and at last, following the example of other strangers, he calls it the Lesser Java; imagining it ought to be of smaller"], [94, "78 ILLUSTRATIONS OF size than an island which was so much more celebrated.\"* But the information communicated in these quotations is found at complete vari ance with the opinion which gives a late origin to the traces of architectural magni ficence in Java; and the same facts have not escaped the penetration of Dr. Vincent, who remarks, \" Jabadios, according to Greek pronunciation, is strictly Javadiu, the island of Java. Ptolemy's position of this island is of no importance, for he has hardly one island correctly placed from Africa to Siam; and his ignorance of its extent is no more extraordinary than his augmentation of Ceylon. But the surprise is, that he should * Crawfurd, iii. 192."], [95, "79 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. have obtained the name of Java; and whether we attribute this to the island now called Java, or to Sumatra, which Marco Polo calls Java Minor, the appellation itself may well excite our astonishment.\"* Research into this subject may well, in deed, excite our astonishment ; for Ptolemy, in mentioning the name of Java, at the same time fixes the position of an emporium, and a large city, to the eastward of the Aurea Chersonesus, and south of the equator, coinci dent with that island.

The yogan, taken at its lowest calculation, is a measure of nine miles; and by the latter lines the Brahmins seem willing to inculcate that the sea has receded from that coast forty-five miles ; and which may probably be as precisely true as the former; which according to that calculation would place it far south of Ceylon.\"* * History of Hindostan, ii. 103. <5"], [98, "82 ILLUSTRATIONS OF Patala is the southern hemisphere of the globe ; for, according to Maurice, \"Patala was supposed to be in the south, because directly opposite to the north pole.\"* And again, \" the south was allegorically called Patala.\"]- The distance of two hundred yogans, which, at the lowest calculation, is admitted to consist of eighteen hundred miles, from the termination of the Ganges in the ocean, or the situation of Juggernaut, will not only bring us to the southern hemisphere, but into the latitude of Java; where, accord ingly, we find the remains of the great city of Majapahit exceeding twenty miles in circumference ; and placed towards the east ern extremity of the island, opposite Bali ; * History of Hindostan, ii. 101. + Ib. 105."], [99, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 83 and almost precisely at the distance of five yogans, or forty-five miles, from the sea, which washes the shores of Java and Ma dura.

And thus Crawfurd is correct in the infe rence which he draws respecting the cause of the appellation Java Minor having been bestowed upon the island of Sumatra. Be- cause being less cultivated, less peopled, and less known than Java, \" it was ima- gined that it ought to be of smaller size than an island so much more celebrated.\" Now, iijava, or the land oi Sheba, boasted of such magnificence in the days of Pto lemy, no reason can be assigned, that at the time of the Queen of Shebds visit to"], [106, "90 ILLUSTRATIONS OF Jerusalem, its splendor may not have been equal, or even greater. Because all ac counts anterior to that period serve rather to swell than diminish the wealth of India, the power of its princes, and the vast extent and splendour of its cities. This view of the ancient history of Java assimilating that country, as has been done with the land of Sheba, naturally and stri kingly accounts for the mortification the Queen felt at the magnificence of Solomon ; and her previous incredulity regarding his glory. All circumstances, therefore, combine in supporting the conclusion of the ancient Sheba and modern Java being identified ; and we thus observe, in the mysterious dis pensations of Providence, though names are changed the places still exist; and that those ports to which the ancient Tyrians navigated"], [107, "91 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. are still the spots best known and most fre quented in modern times. The same conclusions receive powerful corroboration from circumstances connected with the island known to the ancients by the name of Taprobane. The situation of this island is alluded to by Ovid in the fol lowing line : \" Taprobanem Indica tangit acqua.\" And Mela observes \" Taprobane aut grandis admodum insula aut prima pars orbis ulterius Hipparcho dicitur : sed quia habitatur ne quis quam circummeasse tradi tur prope verum est.\"* In thus imagining Taprobane to be a con- * Lib. iii. cap. vii."], [108, "92 ILLUSTRATIONS OF tinent, or commencement of a new world, it so far coincides with the imaginary conti nent placed by Ptolemy to the eastward of the Aurea Chersonesus ; and, accordingly, in the neighbourhood of Taprobane, and to the southward of the equator, and west ward of the Aurea Chersonesus, we find Bonce Fortun\u00e6 Insula ; corresponding in name with Pulo Betuah, or \" Fortune Is land\" of modern charts ; while Zaba is an appellation bestowed upon an island still closer to the coast of Taprobane ; and the western extremity of the latter is named Jovis P romontorium ; that I take to be a commutation of Java corrupted into Jovis by the Romans. This promontory, if my idea be correct, will, therefore, coincide with Java Head; and Bajana, a city to the eastward of the"], [109, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 93 promontory, and Nani Giri, in its vicinity, will be traceable in Anjeer and Boojee Na gara of Sir Stamford's map. The discordant relations regarding Tapro bane have hitherto been accompanied with such manifest difficulty, that almost every writer, of late years, appears to have relin quished the task, in despair of assigning to that country its correct situation. \" Pliny,\" says Dr. Robertson, \" gives a more ample description of Taprobane ; which, instead of bringing any accession of light, involves every thing relating to it in additional ob scurity. After enumerating the various and discordant opinions of the Greek writers, he informs us that ambassadors were sent by a king of that island to the Emperor Clau dius ; from whom the Romans learnt several things concerning it, which were formerly"], [110, "94 ILLUSTRATIONS OF unknown ; particularly that there were five hundred towns in the island ; and that in the centre of it there was a lake three hun dred and seventy-five miles in circumference. These ambassadors were astonished at the sight of the Great Bear and the Pleiades, being constellations which did not appear in their sky; and were still more amazed when they beheld their shadows point to- wards the north, and the sun rise on their left hand and set on their right. They affirmed, too, that, in their country, the moon was never seen until the eighth day after the change, and continued to be visible only to the sixteenth. It is surprising to find an author so intelligent as Pliny re lating all these circumstances without ani- madversion ; and, particularly, that he does not take notice that what the ambassadors reported concerning the appearance of the"], [111, "95 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. moon could not take place in any region of the earth.\"* The circumstances related regarding the lunar phenomena are clearly fictitious ; but to assert, therefore, that Pliny's account, \" instead of bringing any accession of light, involves every thing relating to it in addi tional obscurity,\" seems to me as precipitate as it would be to affirm that Sir John Mandeville never performed any journey into the East, because he describes an ocean of sand and a river of rolling rocks ; which occasioned him to be termed, by the Quar terly Reviewers, \" the Coryph\u00e6us of Liars ;\" or, in short, to reject any history with which a portion of notorious fable happens to be blended. * Disq. on An.

It fortuned that a freed slave of Anius Plocamus, who had farmed the Exchequer of the Customs for imports of the Red Sea, as he made sail about the coasts of Arabia, was in such wise driven with the north winds beside the realm of Carmania, and that for the space of fifteen days ; and that, in the end, he fell in with a harbour thereof, called Hippurus ; and there arrived. When he was set on land, he found the King of that country so courteous, that he gave him entertainment for six"], [113, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 97 months, and entreated him with all kindness that could be devised. And, as he used to discourse and question with him about the Romans and their Emperor, he recounted unto him at large of all things. But, among many other reports that he heard, he wondered, most of all, at their justice in all their dealings, and was in love therewith ; and, namely, that their denieres of the money which was taken were always of like weight, notwithstanding that the sundry stamps and images upon the pieces showed plainly that they were made by divers persons. And hereupon, especially, was he moved and solicited to seek for the alliance and amity of the people of Rome; and so despatched four ambassadors of purpose, of whom one Rachias was the chief and prin cipal personage. By these ambassadors we were informed of the state of that island ; H"], [114, "98 ILLUSTRATIONS OF namely, that it contained five hundred great towns in it ; and that there was a haven therein regarding the south coast, lying hard under Palesimundum, the principal city of all that realm, and the King's seat and palace.

But it will not fail to be observed, that this name contains several of the letters of Majapite or Maspite, the Aspithra of Ptolemy. The names given by Pliny are also recogni sable in Java and its vicinity ; for Palesi mundus, as has been justly suggested to me by Sir S. Raffles, exhibits a slight permu tation of Balesimundur, \" the sea of Bali,\" that washes the eastern extremity of Java ; and the river Cydara, or Kydara, is easily recognisable in the Kadiri river, that flows at no great distance from the ruins of Maja pite; and forms the upper portion of the Calimass, or \" Golden Stream.\" It remains to determine the situation of Hippurus. But this will best be done by tracing the course of Plocamus, upon the"], [119, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 103 map, eastward from the mouth of the Red Sea. Yet as the Queen of Sheba must have disembarked at some port in the Arabian Gulph, from whence she proceeded over land to Jerusalem, and as the ships of Solo mon were accustomed to sail from Ezion Geber to Ophir, it is manifest that Plo camus was not the first who traversed the Indian Ocean. The name Taprobane, as is well known, had been communicated to the nations of the West, by means of the information that had been brought from India by the fol lowers of Alexander the Great. For, says Pliny, \" After the time of Alexan der the Great, and the voyage of his army into those parts, it was discovered and known for a truth, both that it was an is-"], [120, "104 ILLUSTRATIONS OF land, and what compass it bare.\"* It can not, therefore, be judged improbable that Plocamus well knew the course he ought to steer, when he found himself blown out to sea by a violent gale from the north, and the country he could reach ; although his voyage may have been the first that brought the Romans into direct contact with the in- habitants of Taprobane. It is to be ob served, that the course of Plocamus in the first instance was southward ; for he was driven out to sea with the north winds, and afterwards it must have altered to the east, because we find he made the island of Ta probane, which, by the concurrent voice of all antiquity, was situated in the Indian Ocean. Now if the gale drove him at all * Nat. Hist. p. 429."], [121, "105 ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. to the southward of the line, he would, in all probability, first fetch the land in the neigh bourhood of Sabahna Emporium, or Ben coolen. There the current along the coast frequently sets so strong to the southward, and through the straits of Sunda, as I expe rienced in November 1823, that it cannot be wondered a vessel driven by the winds, as his ship is described to have been, should be unable to anchor till she reached the bay formed by the high land of Japhara in Java.

Of these coins, a portion was deposited by me in the Mu seum of the Calcutta Asiatic Society ; and"], [139, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 123 the remainder, together with the coin of Achilleus, have been transmitted to the Honourable Company's Museum in Lon don.* These coins, so unexpectedly ob tained in the Bazars of India, at the dis tance of fifteen centuries from their date, unequivocally testify the entrance of Chris tians, and consequently the introduction of Christianity, into India during the first three centuries of our era. From all that has been stated, I, there fore, draw these inferences \u2014 that Plocamus and Hippalus are the same person, and that this name was bestowed upon him, in commemoration of his voyage to Hippurus, or Iaparah, in Java ; that the Christian religion, though in a confused and imperfect * See note, at the end."], [140, "124 ILLUSTRATIONS OF manner, was, about the same period, commu nicated to the islanders of the Archipelago, under the notion of the arrival of Agis- akka, in Java; that this constituted the new religion which, over the whole of the East, unexpectedly made its appearance during the first century ; and that the era of Salivahana refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, the conflagration of the temple, and dispersion of the Jews by the Roman armies, under the command of Titus. The ancient map admits, accordingly, of arrange ment in this manner. The southern extremity of Taprobane \u2014 corresponds with Java. J abadi-Insula, and Zaba. Western dis trict of Java.

I arrive at the conclusion, that the Seres were not, as generally has been asserted, the Chinese, but inhabitants of Java ; be cause Pliny informs us, that \"the Seres were within their kenning, whom they might easily discover from out of this their island, with whom they had acquaintance by means of traffic and merchandise ; and that Ra chias, his father, used many times to travel thither.\" Vincent gives the origi nal, and says, \" Seras ab ipsis aspice : as if"], [142, "126 ILLUSTRATIONS OF the coast of the Seres were in sight.\"* The Seres, still traceable in Grissee, seem, there fore, to be the people on the banks of the Suria, or Solo river ; and thus correspond with the SaU, who are alleged to have inha bited near the river Palasimundus, or Bali Sumundur, that is, the \" Sea of BaliA In like manner, the Pal\u0153ogoni, mentioned by Megasthenes to inhabit along the banks of a river, may still be traced in Bali Jawani, the inhabitants of the island of Bali, asso ciated with those of the eastern extremity of Java.

If, then, in sailing with the western mon soon, or wind, called Hippalus, a ship fetched, as she would almost necessarily do in those ages of imperfect nautical knowledge, the northern extremity of Sumatra, she would be carried by the current to Pulo Banyak, or Tappanooly ; hence a compound of these names, comprehending ports whence are procured camphor and benzoin of the best quality, according to Marsden, seems to have originally given rise to the name Taprobane, or Tapobane, so celebrated for its spices and perfumes : and if, in steer-"], [145, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY 129 ing eastward from the mouth of the Red Sea, she ran more to the north, and fetched the island of Ceylon, which was known to be surrounded by the sea, while Sumatra was supposed to be a portion of the Indian continent, owing to these circumstances, a confusion of accounts would necessarily lead the western geographers to imagine the ex- istence of an immense country, extending from the latitude of Ceylon to the southward of the line, and generally known by the name of Tapoban ; conveying a confused notion of Ceylon, and part of Sumatra and Java. Sumatra was, however, conceived to form a portion of the continent, and divided into an Argentea Regio, Aurea Regio, and Aurea Chersonesus. The first remarkable town mentioned by Ptolemy, observes Harris, \"beyond the furthermost mouth of the Ganges, was Pentapolis, or rather"], [146, "130 ILLUSTRATIONS OF this was the name of a district ; next to that lay the emporium or mart of Baracura, beyond the mouth of the river Tocossanna ; then the country called Argentea, with se veral towns ; next to that lay the country of the Bisyngetti, who were man-eaters ; their capital, Bysnga, an emporium. From hence, southward, lay the Aurea Cherso nesus.\"* By attending to the map of Sumatra, and allowing the southern extremity of the gold districts to form the Chersonesus, we readily come to a knowledge of the places alluded to by Ptolemy. We first observe that the gold country is to the southward of the Ar gentea, or Silver Region ; and Mela states, \" Ad Tamun Insula est chryse, ad Gangam * Collection of Voyages, i. 493."], [147, "ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY. 131 argyre.\" \" The island Tamun is opposite to the Gold Country, while the Silver fronts the Ganges :\" that is, it lies to the north of the auriferous district.

The Argentea Regio becomes accord ingly identified with Acheen; but it is re markable to notice in this name, a deriva tion of the Sanskreet Chaund, or Chandee, signifying silver ; and I have been informed, by Sir Stamford Raffles, that he learnt from the King of Acheen, that from time immemorial, his metropolis had received k 2"], [148, "132 ILLUSTRATIONS Ol the traditionary appellation of \" the Silver City.\" By Hindus, silver is supposed the female* of gold ; and hence, while the name of Sona, still retained in Sonatra, or Suma tra, was bestowed upon the gold districts, in conformity with the idolatrous notion of two principles, Chaund, now Acheen \u2014 Sil ver \u2014 was assigned as the predominant quality of the neighbouring territory ; and both appellations were translated into Greek and Latin \u2014 by Chryse and Argyre (or Kruse and Argurea) of the former, the Aure\u0153 and Argente\u00e6 Regiones of the latter.

It is said, that one of its many Kings used to give audience, completely gilt all over, the sheet or leaf gold fitting or adhering closely to his skin. If true (it is not recollected where this relation is given) the spectacle must have been curious, and the cos- tume, it is presumed, not very comfortable. In India, this side the Ganges, the presence implies before the King; not unlike our English term : extra Gangem, it is the \" Golden Feet.\" The magnificent temple of Shoemadoo, in Pegu, may certainly find a reasonable derivation of its name from Seo-madeo, a corruption heard every day in"], [159, "143 NOTES hither India, as well as Sheomadeo, of Siva-Maha deva.

But this island has other points sufficient to hang mythological legends on : it unites or divides both hemispheres ; it is cleft \u2014 it is volcanic \u2014 it is, therefore, conical, with a cavernous crater. These are subjects of profound contemplation. In the Map prefixed to Marsden's excellent History of Sumatra, the name of this island is spelled Lengga, or Lengen : and it is remarkable that the outline form given to it is one of the most sacred and profound among the Hindus.
