The three firft Ads, excepting a few corrcdions and omiffions, are literally copied from Beaumont and Fletcher : The two hft ads are new-written by the Duke of Buckingham ; the plot is altered, and the charaders new- drawn. Moft of his alterations have merit ; yet the Scene of the play feems improperly changed. Beaumont and Fletcher have laid it in Bolognia, as they found it in Cervantes: Our Author removed it to Naples. But Bolognia is in the neighbourhood of Ferara, which Naples is not.

He was likewife very intimate with the poets of his time; as Sir John Denham, Sir John Suckling, the Lord Falkland, Mr. Sidney Godolphin, (a near relation to the Lord High Treafurer of England that now is, the glory of that ancient family) Mr. Waller, and Mr. Cowley ; on the laft of whom he bellowed a genteel Annuity during his life, and a noble monument in Weftminfter-Abbey after his deceafe. By travel he had the opportunity of obferving the deco rum of foreign theatres ; efpecially the French, under the regulation of Monfieur Corneille, before it was fo far Ita lianated, and over-run with opera and farce, as now it is ; and before the venom thereof had croffed the narrow feas, and poifoned the Englifh ftage : We being naturally prone to imitate the French in their fafhions, manners, and cuftoms, let them be never fo vicious, fantaftick, or ridiculous.

The civil war filenced the ftage for almoft twenty years, tho' not near fo lewd then as it is fince grown ; and it had been happy for England, if this had been the worft effect of that war. The many changes of government, that fuc ceeded the diffolution of the ancient conftitution, made the people very uneafy, and unanimously defirous of its refti tution; which was effected by a free parliament in the year 1660. This fudden revolution, which is beft known by the name of the Restoration, brought with it many ill cuftoms, from the feveral countries to which the King and the cavaliers were r;tired during their exile, which proved very perni cious to ourEnglifh conftitution, by corrupting our morals; and to which the reviving the ftage, and bringing women on't, and encouraging and applauding the many lewd, fenfelefs, and unnatural plays that enfued upon this great change, did very much contribute. Then appear'd fuch plays as thefe; The siege ob Rhodes, Part I. acted at the Cock-pit, before the Reitera tion ; The Play-house to be lett; The Slighteb Maid ; The United Kingdoms; The Wild Gallant; The English Monsieur ; The Villain ; and the like.

After this, our author endeavoured by writing to expofe the follies of thefe new-fafhioned plays, in their proper colours, and to fet them in fo clear a light, that the people might be able to difcover what trafh it was, of which they were Co fond, as he plainly hints in the prologue ; and fo fet himfelf to the compofing of this farce. When his Grace began it, I could never learn, nor is it very material. Thus much We may certainly gather from the editions of the plays reflected on in it, that it was before the end of 1663, and finifhed before the end of 1664; becaufe it had been feveral times rehears'd, the players were perfect in their parts, and all things in readinefs for its acting before the great plague 1665 ; and that then prevented it. But what was fo ready for the ftage, and fo near being acted at the breaking out of that terrible ficknefs, was very different from what you have fince feen in print.

During this interval, many great plays came forth, writ in heroick rhyme; and, on the death of Sir William D'Avenant, 1669, Mr. Dryden, a new laureat appeared on the ftaee f, much admired, and highly applauded ; which moved the Duke to change the name of his poet from Bilboa to- Bayes, whofe works you will find often men tioned in the following Key.
