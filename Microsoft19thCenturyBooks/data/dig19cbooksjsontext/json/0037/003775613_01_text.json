INTRODUCTION To my Readers, My Life has been a wild, strange life, Now lulled in love \u2014 now wrapt in strife; I've had my dreams as most have had, Like others have been good and bad, Like others have but lived to save A wreck \u2014 a thought\u2014 a hope \u2014 a grave; Have lived to see things fleet around me, And fetters break \u2014 that once have bound me; See hopes arise and hopes depart Through that unguarded fort, the heart! B"], [6, "4 Aud things of strength and ardour pass, Shattered and cold like broken glass; Have heard men talk of wilful death, And laugh with almost the next breath, Then met them in life's later days Strong upon million-trodden ways; Seen lovers lay them down to die Despair in heart aud death io eye, And seen the same in rich content Wived, fathering, housed and corpulent! And if I asked them what became Of passion, death, despair and flame, \u2014 They smiled with red, full, puckering cheek \" A boyish freak ! A boyish freak!\" Seen manhood tread with fuot uncouth O'er all the flowers that blest its youth, And plodding onwards to the tomb, Blush at their late remembered bloom; Ha\\e met the young man, ardent all, Starting on fire at glory's call; Have heard him too with patriot grace Refuse \u2014 yes! even refuse a place! And, yet invincible to bribe, Launch forth his noble diatribe; Have heard him coughed and jested down Alike in parliament and town: For every one was held uncouth. Who smacked of honesty and truth, \u2014 Till drawn to fashion's shot-silk banners"], [7, "5 \"She taught him principles and manners ; False beauty's smiles like snares were spread, Cold irony's keen arrows sped, While bright before his eyes were set Gay ribbon, star and coronet, All \u2014 all the hopes of joy and ease, At that one price alone \u2014 to please! To please? \u2014 To dress by fashion's glass, To serve the few and spurn the mass, Cease to be bold, and frank, and hearty, Abandon country for a party ! While dignities were let for hire, The highest bidder still the buyer, Till little of the man remained, And country lost what party gained. At first I have beheld him burn, Then stand\u2014 then waver \u2014 and then turn! How few could brave \u2014 how few could shun The many bearing on the one! Oh! Who the tempting could withstand? Who would not choose the safe left-hand, Within the courtly harbour get And anchor with a coronet, Held by a ribbon from afar, And blazoned: bondsman! by a star?

Experience teaches, all who live Must bear, but duty says, forgive ! Nor leave men in your pride of mood For that they know not their own good! What? do the prophets cease to preach Because the ignorant they teach? No! But with truth they meet reviling, Curses with prayers and frowns with smiling, Until at length the calm, strong word, From sounding ever, shall be heard. Faint pauses steal on stormiest weather. The stream is heard, that flows \u2014 for ever! Life's fitful changes overpassed, I've seen men settle down at last With wealth and power and heaped up grace, But all with such a dull, sour face !

And thus the daily trial came; For lightly spoke the voice of fame Of those once loved by Lord de Vere, When even of an equal sphere.

Contumely from the lofty cast, Unruffled still may be o'erpassed, But poison lurks upon the lip Of base presumption's fellowship.

Up to town and back again!\" \" Not yet, my Lord! the noon of day, \" Makes a short tarry no delay. \"Best travelling, Sir! at evening's cool.\" (\"And thence at noon you play the fool.) \" My father deemed you far away; \" State-errands brook not overstay; \"And Sir! this house is not the place \"To stigmatize with love-disgrace!\""], [36, "\"Ha! Sir, you dare. I\" \"I've nothing said: \" Let the cap fit the owner's head.\" A very tempest Warven shook, But sunk to Clare's imploring look; A thousand thoughts athwaTt his face, Sped lifelike with a carnal trace : His father, who had sent him here To act a fondly dreamed career, For his sake too had bade him bear: Two much-enduring years had flown, Preferment almost seemed his own: \u2014 And all his prospects thus to hurl Beneath the insult of a churl, And, most of all, to part from Clare \u2014 To leave her in her helplessness, Exposed to wrong without redress ! \u2014 Hot through his brain the mad whirl flew, He bowed \u2014 not bent \u2014 and slow withdrew. Clare turned to follow, following not \u2014 A spell had fixed her to the spot, Beneath alternate feeling's sway, To follow \u2014 shame, and fear to stay. And Philip took her trembling hand, His burning breath her flushed cheek fanned As from the coiling of an asp She drew her hand from out his clasp. 34"], [37, "35 \" By heaven! I love you, and my will \" Shall work to its one purpose still ! \" I can not and I care not speak \" My passion strong in language weak. \" Untaught to sue, unused to sigh, \" My Love is fierce, and so am I. \" Be mine! \u2014 ask all you wish or want! \" I've power to give and will to grant.\" She struggled in his fiery hold \u2014 He felt her fevered hand turn cold, While lapsed beneath the o'erstraining reach Of grief, that fettered tears and speech. And Lord de Vere was fair to sight, With noble form and stately height, Unconscious grace \u2014 commanding air, But more \u2014 oh, more was wanting there ! The halo round his presence thrown, Was all his sires' and none his own. That hard cold smile of inborn pride, Made not to blandish, but deride, Seemed boasting gifts of wealth and art, And nature's all \u2014 except a heart! And he mistook the veiled intent, The anguished silence for consent; Her trembling form on his was leant, Her brown hair o'er his shoulders strayed"], [38, "36 His wild arms clasped the fainting maid : The hurricane the rose may break, Whose perfume Zephyr dared not wake \u2014 The lips, e'en Warven shrunk to press, Strength rifled in a forced caress: When stirred, as tempest stirs a flame, The brave soul through the sinking frame, And passed, for one wild moment's space, A very June athwart her face, Then settled in a solemn mood, Where even anger seemed subdued \"Nay! Fly not, Clare ! One moment heed! \" What guerdon can repay that kiss! \" If Warven's fortunes claim your meed, \" Wealth \u2014 rank \u2014 all \u2014 all he craves are his\" \" Oh ! Lord ete Vere, what word or deed, \" Gave warrant for a wrong like this? \" Name one ! I'll hold this insult light, \" And scorn myself to give you right.\" Baseness may plan and might may do, But weakness has its own power too; Men, all unchecked by threat or tear, Those, whom they've injured, learn to fear: Silent he stood beneath her spell, But through his proud heart anger ran, While prouder still her answer fell: ' ' A Noble \u2014 not a Gentleman !\""], [39, "37 As slowly from the spot turned Clare, He eyed her with a yellow glare, Abashed in deed but not in will, Deep in his cold heart sinning still. And Clare in passing heard the talk Of menials on the terrace-walk : They fixed her with a jeering eye, As sped she all dishevelled by, But grew to insolence their sneer When lingering followed Lord de Vere. With foot that fled, and glance that shunned, By those low whispers thunderstunned, Clare, who upheld her pride of mood When others witnessed, sunk subdued Within her chamber's solitude; Her tears, by their own flood repressed, Fell large upon her heaving breast, As with an effort overgushed From the poor, throbbing heart they crushed. And thus she sat, a weary space, Uer white hand on her whiter face, Until a meek smile softening stole Like pale forthgliding of the soul To meet the hopes in distance given,\u2014 Orphan of earth but heir of heaven. And thus at times with Hope's fond art, She sadly soothed her fluttering heart;"], [40, "3si For still she deemed, that woman's worth Might pass uninjured o'er the earth, And innate dignity disarm The thought, that dares, though coward, to harm : Unknowing there are brutish souls, Whom nought restrains and nought controls, Who love to wreck the good and fair, If only \u2014 that it woos to spare; And what repels, to them, invites In strange perverseness of delights. But strength o'er-tasked began to fail, Her tender cheek was growing pale \u2014 And those few ties of early worth, That bound her aching heart to earth \u2014 The cherished dead in blessed graves, The friends afar o'er hills and waves, How had they burned with anger's glow, Her slightest suffering but to know! Yet vain alike had been their pain, Their pity and their anger vain \u2014 For her's could be no better lot And change be only \u2014 change of spot. Oh ! other were it if the poor Had spirits modelled to endure, And hardened souls no sin could soil; Not framed to feel but made to toil, Mere stubborn forms, thus wrought, to prove Tools of a raste \u2014 machines to move \u2014"], [41, "39 Untaught to hope \u2014 unused to love ! But while they still, like us, have feelings And glimpses true of bright revealings, How can they bear the scourge's pain And not be tempted to complain? Plod life's hard way with bleeding feet, Nor curse the bitter thorns they meet? If still you ask why Clare remained Where insult stung and slander pained, I answer : it is well for ye To hurl defiance at your peers, Armed with wealth's golden panoply Or, better still, the friends of years; But she was helpless and forlorn, Sent from a kind hand's fostering care, Unused to wrong, neglect and scorn, No home to seek \u2014 no heart to dare: (For could she now \u2014 in self-distress \u2014 Increase that poor home's wretchedness?) It was a haven she had found, Life but a whirlpool flashing 'round: No wonder that she still should shrink To quit the rough rock's sheltering brink, For waves where stronger swimmers sink. And while as yet irresolute, 'Twixt fear and indignation mute, Sure Time his shadowy quiet lent \u2014"], [42, "40 Barring the cold discomfort sent Whenever social rules are rent, That still avenge themselves and wreak A watchful, strange embarassment On all we look \u2014 or do \u2014 or speak; And, wearing off by slow degrees, Monotony returned with ease; While Philip nor by sign nor word To that strange meeting once recurred, But coldly \u2014 studiously polite, Seemed thus oblivion to invite. 'Tis rarely that we see combined, Great passions with a groveling mind; In such \u2014 revenge and hate, estranged, Appear to spite and envy changed; And changed in names and natures all, Creation to the Small seems small; While quailing still, the eye of Sin Shuns scrutiny as terror's twin: But Philip, born beyond control, Had still the giant in his soul; No blood by frosts of fearing thinned, - And when he sinned he greatly sinned. And thus it was that two dark forms Rode billowed on his inward storms, Alternate vanquished or elate, But present ever, \u2014 love and hate;"], [43, "41 And with that hatred he pursued Warven in keen, unsparing mood And sought, still ready to oppress, To sting him unto self-redress; Whilst he, by no false pride suborned, Could brook the insult that he.scorned, And Clare, whom watchful love made mute, Screened from his knowledge Philip's suit. But love has eyes of vision keen \u2014 Sees things by apathy unseen; Thus through her cheek of stainless snow, He read the heart that bled below, And she, \u2014 with anxious ardour pressed, \u2014 While striving to evade, confessed! Then burnt his very blood like flame, That all Clare's tears could scarcely tame; Full soon that tempest iflsubdued Must fire his sullenness of mood: He tought the moment, and \u2014 it came. Along the gloomy mansion spread A neavy silence rested dead, When on the still air wandering by, Arose a cry \u2014 a single cry ! And Warven heard \u2014 and Warven sped As though his feet were lightning-led \u2014 Thought scarce more swift \u2014 speech far too slow, It was a look \u2014 it was a blow! \u2014 e 2"], [44, "42 A twelvemonth's heaped-up anger pent, One moment found electric vent: Dashed backward with unequal might, Reeled Philip's form of towering height; But in that blow the strength was spent \u2014 Faded the flush from Warven' s face. On Philip's cheek a livid trace; \u2014 He turned : \u2014 a ory \u2014 a heavy fall \u2014 Uprushed the menials from the hall, And lifted, senseless in his gore, Pale Warven from the marble floor! While Philip flushed, irresolute, In the room's centre stood as mute, And Clare with love's soft ministry, Raised Warven' s head upon her knee. None question asked \u2014 none spoke a word \u2014 All read at once what had occurred; But Lady Caerleon's ready tact, While others thought, taught her to act And with a cold, discerning sense, Embrace at once the consequence. Then hung on Clare each menial's eye With insolence of scrutiny; And there she stood \u2014 dishevelled, pale, A lily \u2014 trembling in the gale \u2014 Her love profaned to vulgar sight, While festering lips were breathing blight, And Warven' s Wrong turned Philip's Right"], [45, "43 But she, not deigning a reply, Uplifted proud her clear, blue eye : \"What means your presence?

For she could smile opponents down With smiles more cutting than a frown : And, deepening still, the circle round The low surmise in whispers wound, While none replied \u2014 and none denied \u2014 And Truth stood mute with grief and pride. But Lady Caerleon changed her hue, Dreading for once what might ensue, When slowly over Warven' s face Death seemed to glide with freezing pace, And, as she saw that look of stone, It grew reflected in her own ! She learned to fear, who could not feel, Nor wished to cancel \u2014 but conceal; Thence with bland words of wiling kind, Essayed to soothe Clare's artless mind"], [46, "A'l And, bribing silence, stifling hate, All fairly spoke \u2014 but spoke too late !

And Slander with their names made light, While Reputation went with Might.

Afresh breath came from Nature's lip, Hung with clear dews, that Gods might sip; The forest-depths were all astir From pine-tassel to chorister, And slanting sunlight through them wound Embroideries gold on emerald ground: When forth we went, we two alone, With hearts that beat in unison, Like two lutes filled with one sad tone; And, when tears failed to give relief, We laughed aloud from very grief !"], [50, "48 And how we sported!
