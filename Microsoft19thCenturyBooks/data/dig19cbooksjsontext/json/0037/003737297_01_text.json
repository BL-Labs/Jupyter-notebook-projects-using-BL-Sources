Looking neither to the right nor to the left, with his eyeballs set in the fixed stare of one who escapes for his life from some mortal peril, his head sunk down npon his breast, and a shadow upon his forehead like the shadow of death, a man arose and fled, gallop ing northward through the night from the city of Sufarest. He rode furiously, brutally, striking the spurs into his horse's flanks again and again, without reason, as if he tasted some wild relief in feeling the terrified brute plunge and tremble beneath him ; as if it soothed him to find that there was something still left that feared him, something on which he could glut the silent rage that gnawed his heart. Soon the lights of the city lay behind him. The last straggling houses of the suburb were past, and he dashed out upon the open highway. He hardly noted the change. Blind to everything around him, except the one white patch of road just in front of his horse's head, he flew on, as though he knew that E"], [14, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 2 the danger which encompassed him was vast as the horizon, and dark as the night itself. Hour after hour he rode at the same fierce speed. The stars came out ; the moon rose, glided across a corner of the sky, and disappeared. The lights in the lonely huts and villages along the road went out one by one at midnight, and were rekindled one by one at dawn. He noticed nothing. The tall trees swept and shuddered past him in his flight, as he skirted the edge of some gloomy forest, or crossed the beds of chilly, rock-bound streams. Only when some fork divided the straight wide road in two did he glance upward for a moment at the stars, and then, choosing most often the right-hand branch, pressed on as blindly as before. When, with the first grey of dawn, the horse, worn out and bleeding, gave its last leap and fell beneath him, he regained his feet with a harsh laugh, and kicked the dying brute savagely in its expiring gasps. His flight was not interrupted for long. It was only necessary to walk on \u2014 nay, better to run \u2014 a few hundred paces to the nearest farm stead, and fling down a handful of gold for another mount. He left the first lying in its blood upon the road. The pursuit he feared was not from behind, then ? Rather did it seem no corporeal, tangible pursuer that he fled before, but some all-embracing peril, more cruel from the very uncertainty of the quarter whence it was to come, more appaUing from the mystery that shrouded its advance. So he remounted and rode on all through the next day. He carried nothing with him, save the money that"], [15, "THE TWO HOESEMEN. 3 was to provide him with the means of salvation. He had made no preparations, packed neither bag nor wallet, but started forth in one swift impulse of sudden fear, taking to this strange flight with the old, wild instinct of the Tartar, when he sets forth through the wilderness to place a hundred leagues between him and the camp of his enemy, between sunrise and sunrise. Before noon he found himself on the banks of the great world-famous river which formed the boundary of two kingdoms. There was a ferry at this point, and man and horse embarked upon the low, clumsy, raft-like vessel, and were carried tediously across the broad flood. Arrived at the other side the man remounted once more, and with unslackened speed resumed his desperate progress. And just an hour after the first horseman had passed on his way, the old ferryman was aware of a second, who came along the same road, riding as fast, though not so furiously \u2014 a man whose face, instead of the pallor and wildness of fear, wore the cold grim impassiveness of the judge. He too demanded to be transported to the other side, and, when he had been landed there, rode on relentlessly at the same unchanging speed. Through the day and through the night, keeping ever behind the first horseman on the same road, stopping at the same places that he stopped at, taking food and drink where he had taken them, renewing horses as often as he renewed them, and keeping ever just one hour behind him, rode the second. Steady as time, certain as fate, he followed on, making no attempt to come up with the fugitive,"], [16, "THE PRINCE OP BALKISTAN. 4 never for an instant allowing the fugitive to gain one mile on him. Days pass in this strange chase. A kingdom is crossed. Towns and villages follow one another along the route like toy towns and villages ; the great distances of common life are swallowed up in this overwhelming race ; rivers and mountains sink into milestones beside the path of the two horsemen as they sweep on. In the daytime they meet with many other travellers upon the roads. They overtake many going in the same direction. But no one overtakes them. Occasionally some beggar, more resolute than common, makes an attempt to stop the first horse man, and is rewarded by a curse. But no beggar asks the second horseman for an alms. Sometimes a greeting is shouted at the first horse man as he rushes past. He never stays to answer. But the greeting dies upon the lips of those who look in the face of the second horseman, and he rides on in silence. And now they are drawing near to another frontier, beyond which lies the huge extent of the great Russian realm. In those dominions their progress is likely to be less easy. For this is the land of secrecy, a land given over to the government of spies, where men walk abroad in doubt and heaviness, shackled by invisible chains, and the actions of all are watched by keen suspicious eyes. For this is the land where the great volcano of the Revolution groans and seethes beneath the surface, and the whole forces of the Government are devoted to trampling down the embers of sedition, and for every plot there is a"], [17, "THE TWO HOE SEMEN. 5 counterplot, and no man knows what a day may bring forth. Yet none the less the two horsemen speed forward, and neither slackens his pace. When the frontier is crossed, the horseman in advance seems to take a fresh resolution. He turns his horse's head to the eastward, racing frantically across the vast breadth of Southern Russia. Here on the great plains the wind is cold, and the nights are sharply spiked with frost. Not for this does either pursued or pursuer draw rein. League after league, with only such brief rests as nature cannot go without, the black silent provinces are spanned and left behind. If the first horseman begins to flag, if his aching limbs fail him for a moment, and he is obliged to dismount and snatch a short interval of sleep, the second horseman dismounts as well, takes exactly the same spell of rest, and then resumes his seat in the saddle and keeps up at the same fixed interval as before. Now the way has to be picked with caution. They pass through no great towns. In the villages they make a stir and a commotion. The people run out of their houses to see the first horseman pass, and gaze and chatter to each other about the sight. But when the second horseman passes they go back into their houses without speaking, and close and bar the doors. From time to time men in uniform are encountered, agents of the all-pervading Government across whose territories they speed their course. These men show a disposition to stop them, and inquire into their errand. To such inquiries the first horseman has a ready answer. A spoken word, backed up by a coin"], [18, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 6 of silver or of gold, carries him past every obstacle like the magic syllable in Eastern tales. Then when an hour has passed these same officials are sure to be overtaken by another horseman, of graver, steadier mien, keeping up swiftly in the track of the first. When questioned, he too has his magic password. A whisper from him, sometimes accom panied by a sign, is enough. Whole provinces do not contain one man daring enough to step between him who flies and him who pursues. The White Terror finds itself confronted with the Black Terror, and recoils. Again days pass away without a check in this mad ride. At last they are drawing near to the eastern con fines of Russia. For the first time a look of doubt crosses the face of him who rides behind. Is the man in front of him about to plunge beyond into the inhospitable deserts of Tartary; to seek a refuge among the farthest Asiatic hordes ? Away beyond the frontier stretch rough tracks, only marked by the distant posting stations, in those wide belts of many hundred miles into which the railroad has not yet advanced its iron foot. But as he nears the beginning of one of these desert routes, the first horseman begins to break down. He has ridden, not too fast, but too fiercely for his strength. The last day he spends in the saddle he keeps swaying and falling, and in the evening he pulls up on reaching a small posting village, and dismounts. He asks if a vehicle and horses can be had, to take him on at once, and finding that they can, he puts a pistol to the head of his twentieth used-up horse."], [19, "THE TWO HOESEMEN. 7 An hour after, the postmaster is astonished by the arrival of a second stranger, who makes the same demand. The postmaster is unable to supply him, and he tells him he must stay till the arrival of horses from another stage. The stranger dismounts and sits down quietly to wait. The ride is over. They have been on horseback, with a few short breaks, for more than a fortnight, and have covered sixteen hundred miles. It is time to tell the story of these two men, and of how they came to ride this race, and also of its end."], [20, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 8 CHAPTER I. A NARROW ESCAPE. It was a gorgeous spectacle. The capital of Bal kistan was given up to enthusiasm. From every window of the houses waved draperies and banners, scarlet and purple and gold ; lofty arches, festooned with bright devices in flowers, and lettered with festive mottoes, crossed the main streets ; and the roadways underneath were hidden by moving crowds clad in the bright picturesque dress of the country, and brandishing innumerable ornamented weapons whose presence on such an occasion betokened a region that had hardly yet taken its place in the family of civilized nations. The sound of bells came from churches whose white cupolas showed out boldly beside the silent minarets of the deserted mosques, and ever and anon the loud blare of trumpets and the crash of drums and cymbals broke out and drowned the voices of the bells, to be drowned in turn by the huzzas from ten thousand throats at once, as the rejoicing population gave vent to their triumph in their country's freedom. The flags waved thickest, and the scimitars and spears glinted brightest, and the music and the shouts swelled in loftiest volume, where, in an open carriage drawn by six magnificent steeds, a young man, bareheaded,"], [21, "A NARROW ESCAPE. 9 came slowly down the principal thoroughfare of Sufarest, with a proud smile upon his handsome face, as he acknowledged with repeated bows the cheers which broke out at every step of his triumphal progress. Beside him, sharing to the full in the exhilaration of the scene, sat a lady, whose older aspect and the looks of fond admiration which she turned upon him from time to time, clearly proclaimed her to be his mother. On the seat facing them was the only other occupant of the carriage, resplendent in the rich episcopal robes of his Church, who threw cold glances over the faces of the crowd, as he went along, and kept nervously smoothing his long grey beard. It was the state progress of Prince Rodolph, the new ruler of Balkistan, from the building in which he had just opened the Deputschin, the National Assembly of the Balkiards, to his palace, where the ministers and principal deputies were to be feasted in honour of the event. Behind the carriage in which he rode with his mother, the Princess Claudine, and Monsignor Stefan, Metropolitan Bishop of Sufa rest, came a long train of other carriages, containing M. Karkchulov, the Prime Minister, and other members of the Cabinet and important functionaries of State. The procession was escorted in front and rear by the picked troops of the Balkiard army, who had already won their spurs on one pitched field, and the sight of whose uniforms roused the popular enthusiasm to the highest pitch. Suddenly, just as the royal carriage was passing under a triumphal arch embroidered with the names \" Rodolph \" and \" Balkistan \" in gaily coloured"], [22, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 10 ribbons, a warning voice rang out in sharp, horror breathing tones \u2014 \" Murder ! \" The cry was instantly taken up and repeated by a score of surrounding throats ; it swelled into an angry roar, and went thundering down the great avenue. But swiftly as the word was thus echoed, it had been followed yet more swiftly by the fierce crack of a pistol-shot. At the very moment that the horrified bystanders caught sight of a gleaming barrel pointed in the direction of the Prince, they saw the puff of smoke which told that the assassin had fired. Fortunately for Rodolph, that first startled cry was just in time to reach the man's ears before his fingers had drawn the trigger. It gave him an unexpected shock, and the momentary unsteadiness that resulted caused his hand to swerve, only a hair's-breadth, it is true, but, at the distance at which his victim was, the hair's-breadth became three inches, and the bullet which would otherwise have brought death entered the back of the carriage immediately behind the Prince's left ear. Before there was time to empty another barrel a dozen hands had been stretched out to seize the weapon, and the man who held it was being shaken like a rat in the grasp of the furious crowd. It would be idle to pretend that Prince Rodolph displayed no agitation at this frightful incident. He turned pale, and trembled for an instant ; the next moment he had conquered the signs of weakness and turned anxiously towards his mother. With the courage of her race \u2014 she was a princess of the dispossessed royal house of France \u2014 she was striving"], [23, "A NARROW ESCAPE. 11 to battle with the emotion which shook her through and through. A cry of terror had been stifled on her lips at the sight of the pistol-flash. She now clutched the cushions of the carriage till her knuckles turned white, in the effort to suppress any further symptom of alarm. Satisfied by a look that her son was unhurt, her sole thought now was to prevent the affair from creating a disagreeable impression and dispelling the joy of the national festival. The mother and son were worthy of one another, and both had learned that stern self-suppression whose necessity hes upon the great. Their companion, in spite of his reverend years and ecclesiastical training, exhibited more excitement than either of them. At the discharge of the pistol he had half risen from his seat, staring strangely at the Prince. On perceiving that Rodolph had come off scathless from the attempt, the Bishop sank down again upon his seat, and began with much agitation of manner to pour out his congratu lations on the providential escape. While he did so he suffered his eye to glance in the direction of the would-be murderer, as if to ascertain what had become of him. Such was also the impulse of the Prince, as soon as he had exchanged looks of mutual reassurance with his mother. The sight they beheld was well calculated to restore the Prince's confidence in his people's loyalty, and it was not surprising if it caused the shudder which passed over the priest. The crowd had closed with a fierce rush upon the firer of the revolver, one man had seized him by the throat, others had gripped his arms, and a shower of blows and kicks was descending on him from all sides. Every member of the throng,"], [24, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 12 in fact, who thought himself near enough to reach the prisoner, was aiming savagely in his direction, and those who could not get within arm's length were thrusting at him with their knives and the stocks of their guns. He had already been forced down on one knee, and it was evident that, unless some help arrived at once, the man would lose his life in a manner more dreadful than that in which he had prepared to take the life of another. As it happened, owing to the nature of the occa sion, there was a considerable force within easy reach. Before the mob had had time to push its vengeance to a fatal limit, therefore, a formidable squad of the newly organized police of Sufarest had split the crowd in two like a wedge, enclosed the prisoner in their midst, and carried him off, followed by the hoots and curses of the populace. Meanwhile the royal procession, which had halted for a few moments, resumed its way, and went on, accompanied by the volleying cheers of the spectators, to the Prince's palace. There was no room for mis take as to the feelings of the people towards their ruler. Evidently he was admired and deeply beloved by them, and his escape from the recent deadly peril served to intensify the heartiness of their greetings. Again and again the carriage was nearly brought to a standstill by the throngs whose enthusiasm led them to press round it for a glimpse of their hero, as he smiled and bowed more cordially than ever. At last, on arriving at the palace gate, he stood up in the carriage and made a final gracious acknowledg ment of the good-will of his subjects. There was a last cheer, louder than any that had gone before, and the Prince was hidden from their sight."], [25, "A NAEEOW ESCAPE. 13 The vehicle rolled up to the broad flight of steps, down which a crimson carpet had been spread, and the Prince dismounted, still with the same pleased and courageous expression on his face which it had worn throughout the ride. He stopped and assisted the Princess to alight, and then, without waiting for Monsignor Stefan, passed hastily into the palace. He traversed the state-rooms without stopping, entered his private cabinet, and closed and locked the door. As he did so a great change passed over his countenance. The smile vanished like a veil which had done its work, and left behind a look of rage, of horror, it might almost be added, of dread. Such, at least, was the impression conveyed to the mind of the only spectator, a young man of about the Prince's own age, who had been seated in the cabinet at his entrance, and had risen respectfully to welcome him. \" Halstein \u2014 do you know \u2014 have you heard ? \" were Prince Rodolph's first words, which broke from him in jerks, as he dropped heavily into an armchair. \" No ! Surely nothing has gone wrong, sir ? \" exclaimed the private secretary, for such he was. He was more ; he was the fellow-countryman and trusted friend of Prince Rodolph, whom he had accompanied from his native land on the Prince accepting the throne of Balkistan. Count Halstein was a little dark man, with a thoughtful cast of countenance. He had not been present at the ceremony of the opening of the Deputschin, for his master, anxious to avoid wounding the national susceptibilities of the Balkiards, kept his fellow countryman out of sight as much as possible."], [26, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 14 \" I have been shot at. Another inch, and I should have been \u2014 \" A shudder completed the sentence. \" God in Heaven ! How terrible ! And by whom ? And why, \u2014 if I may ask ? \" \"It is easier for you to ask than for me to answer.\" And Rodolph briefly described what had occurred. The secretary was deeply excited. \" Pray Heaven this may be the work of a lunatic ! \" he observed. \" You have done nothing to reproach yourself with. You have not forfeited your popularity.' ' \"I am more popular than ever,\" replied the Prince; \"more popular, that is, with the people of Balkistan, though not with those who assume to rule her destinies against her own will.\" Count Halstein glanced uneasily and questioningly at the Prince. His glance was returned by one of deep significance. \"At all events, this affair must be sifted to the bottom,\" he remarked. \" The police must leave no stone unturned.\" \" I will sift it to the bottom.\" Prince Rodolph had risen, and was rapidly pacing up and down the room. \"But not with the aid of the Sufarest police. I must have some one that I can trust more implicitly than any of these people that surround me. Whom can I be sure of ? The very Ministry is rotten. The Metropolitan is my enemy. I am enclosed by traitors on all sides, from the moment I step outside this room.\" The secretary looked grave. \" We must see what the man who aimed at you has to say for himself,\" he said, slowly and cautiously. \" If he should prove to be a Russian \u2014 \" He did not conclude his sentence, and both men"], [27, "A NAEBOW ESCAPE. 15 remained plunged in a gloomy meditation, from which they were only aroused by a knock at the door of the room. As the Count moved towards the door to open it, Rodolph held up a warning finger. \"Not a word before any of the Ministers,\" he whispered. \" I trust no one now except my mother \u2014 and you.\" Halstein bowed gratefully, and unfastened the door. A messenger was outside, who announced that the head of the Ministry, M. Karkchulov, was in waiting. \" Ask him to come here,\" commanded Prince Rodolph. The lackey withdrew, and presently returned, usher ing in the Prime Minister of Balkistan. \" You are welcome, M. Karkchulov. Sit down. Do you bring me any information about that wretched man?\" \"He is outside, your Highness. I caused him to be brought here at once, instead of being examined at the police bureau, in order that you might be satisfied that, so far as we are concerned, there is no desire for anything but the most open and thorough investigation.\" \"You are very considerate. As the object of the attack, I naturally feel more concerned in the matter than anybody else ; but I should not like you to suppose that I doubt for a moment the sincere devotion of my friends, and particularly of my Ministers.\" M. Karkchulov bowed, then glanced at Count Halstein, who sat retired in one corner, and replied\u2014"], [28, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 16 \" On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I thank your Highness for your expressions of confidence.\" He threw a slight emphasis on the word expressions. \" Yet we cannot but feel that we, who are so recently known to you, can hardly hope to occupy such a favourable place in your trust as if we had been always fellow-countrymen of your own.\" Prince Rodolph frowned. \" Sir,\" he answered, \"it would be absurd for me to pretend that I do not understand your meaning. But I do not think you render justice to my position. I have come here, as everybody knows, at no slight personal risk. The unsettled state of the country, the fate of my predecessor, \u2014 above all, the open denial of my right to the sovereignty by the Czar of Russia, makes my position one of great difficulty. lam in a country that is new to me, and among men whom as yet I have had no opportunity of testing. I am surrounded, as you well know, by spies ; and even, as you must admit after to-day, by assassins. These men are either Balkiards or Russians disguised as such. Some of the members of the Deputschin itself are in the service of Russia, they look for reward to the Czar, they aim at turning Balkistan into a Russian province, and, whether they succeed or fail, the Czar is able to receive them in their flight, or to extend diplomatic protection to them even in the very hands of my police. Is it to be wondered at that I find a comfort in the presence of a native of my own country, who cannot possibly be under any temptation to desert me, and whom, as you have observed, I have known for many years ? No, M. Karkchulov; as long as the interests of Balkistan are concerned I shall consult you, and"], [29, "A NAEEOW ESCAPE. 17 you alone ; but in a matter affecting my personal safety, you must permit me to avail myself of the services of my private friend.\" \"Your Highness is right. I admit the justice of what you have said, and I thank you for your condescension in explaining your views. I trust that you and Count Halstein will put anything I have said down to my zeal for your Highness's own interests.\" Prince Rodolph acknowledged this speech with a bow, and then, stepping forward, by a happy impulse drew his arm familiarly through that of the Minister. \" Come, M. Karkchulov, we will go and see your prisoner. Halstein, you too.\" The three proceeded together to an outer saloon, in which half a dozen members of the police force were keeping guard over the criminal. He barely looked up at their entrance, and at once lowered his eyes to the ground. On their part they saw a low, squat figure, dressed in workman's garb, with dark hair and complexion, and narrow, deep-set eyes, into which it was difficult to look, the lids were kept so closely down. His mouth was lined by a pair of thin, cruel-looking lips, which hardly parted when he spoke, and his voice was low, hesitating, and indistinct. Both the Prince and his secretary thought they could detect a furtive expres sion in his countenance and bearing, as if he had something to hide, and were schooling himself to meet the coming examination. The interrogation was commenced by M. Kark chulov, at a sign from the Prince, asking the prisoner his name. c"], [30, "18 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. \" Simski Simskivitch.\" The answer was muttered rather than spoken. The Minister had put the question in the dialect of Balkistan, which was evidently understood by the man whom he addressed. \" Where do you come from ? Are you a native of Balkistan ? \" \" No ; I am a Russian citizen.\" A covert glance at his questioners accompanied this answer, which was spoken in the ordinary Russian language, which, it should be explained, is closely akin to that of Balkistan. Both were equally familiar to the three investigators, but the former was less likely to be understood by the police stand ing by. Prince Rodolph, who had exchanged rapid looks with his secretary at the last answer, therefore whispered to M. Karkchulov to continue the examina tion in the tongue chosen by the prisoner. \" How long have you been in Sufarest ? \" was the next question. \" Three months.\" \" Where have you been living during that time ? \" \"At No. 10, Place Debransch. I am a working jeweller, and I was looking for enrployment. As I couldn't get it, I determined to attract attention by some means or other, in order to save myself from starving, so I went out and discharged a pistol. I didn't know there was a bullet in it.\" This story was recited a little too glibly not to confirm the distrust which was already felt by at least two of his listeners. \"But was there a bullet? \" Prince Rodolph broke in, as he finished. \" What makes you think there was one now ? \""], [31, "A NARROW ESCAPE. 19 This pertinent query staggered the prisoner. Re lapsing into the dogged manner he had forsaken a minute before, he stammered \u2014 \"I thought \u2014 I think \u2014 I heard some one talking about it.\" The Prince smiled coldly. \" See,\" he resumed, \" you say you are a jeweller. Is that a genuine stone or not ? \" And he took a diamond from his pocket, and handed it to the fellow. Again the rascal was puzzled. After fingering it uneasily for a few seconds, however, he suddenly let the gem fall, as if by accident, between his feet. Rodolph fell into the trap. Involuntarily he made a hasty movement forward to see where it lay. Before he could recover his impassiveness the pri soner had stooped, picked it up, and returned it to him, with the observation \u2014 \"A very fine stone, as far as I can judge, your Highness.\" The Prince felt himself outwitted. He reproached himself mentally for stooping to the part of a detec tive, and allowed M. Karkchulov to continue the interrogation. \" Where were you working before you came here ? \" \"At Odessa. I can give you a reference from my employer there.\" \" No doubt. Does any one in Sufarest know you ? Have you associated with any one since you arrived? \" \" No one in particular. I registered my name with the Russian Consul-General, in accordance with the law. The only people I have spoken to have been in cafes.\" \"You say you have been seeking employment. How was it you failed to get it ? \""], [32, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 20 \" On account of various things. First, my being a foreigner was against me. Then, I had only one reference, and that was too far off. Besides, my clothes weren't respectable enough for them to entrust me with the stones.\" The tale seemed plausible enough. They might hang the man on suspicion, but there did not seem to be any chance of tracing complicity to others. So reasoned the Minister. He turned to his master, and said in a whisper \u2014 \" I don't see much use in putting further questions to him now. Of course his house must be searched, and inquiries made at the Consulate and in Odessa, and meanwhile he will be kept in strict custody.\" Prince Rodolph assented with a nod, and led the way back to his cabinet, followed by the other two, the man Simski being taken off under a strong escort to the gaol. As soon as they were again alone, the Prince turned to his Minister. \"Now, M. Karkchulov, what do you think of all this ? \" M. Karkchulov's reply was cautious. \"I hardly like to pronounce an opinion at this stage, your Highness. We have yet to find out how far this scoundrel's account of himself will be confirmed. It sounds rather suspicious, but for all that we may not fiud it very easy to disprove.\" The Prince looked at him mournfully. \" My dear sir, what possible difference does our power to disprove a tissue of falsehoods make to our own opinion of its truth ? No doubt this fellow can produce the proofs of his story; no doubt his \u2022employers have taken very good care to supply him"], [33, "A NAEEOW ESCAPE. 21 with every possible evidence of his assumed identity, and to destroy every trace that could connect him with themselves. What I want you to tell me is whether you, as an honest man, believe that we are dealing with a poor workman driven to assassinate\u2014 for of course there was a bullet \u2014 by want of bread ? And if you disbelieve it, then what or who do you think really prompted him ? \" \" Sire, I cannot disguise from myself what your suspicions point to. I may freely admit that I regard the story we have just heard with considerable doubt, but beyond that I, as a prudent man, cannot go. It may be that some of the more extreme members of the Russophile faction are capable \"of entering into such a plot ; but suspicions of this kind, unless thoroughly well-founded, and capable of the most ample proof, are dangerous \u2014 dangerous to those affected by them, yet more dangerous to those who express them. I have my duty towards my country, as well as my duty towards your Highness, and I should feel it a terrible responsibility to pursue any line of conduct which might tend to embroil us with a power like that of Russia, except under the very strongest compulsion.\" The Prince had listened to this speech with out ward composure. At its close he contented himself with remarking, with a rather bitter smile \u2014 \" Thank you, sir ; I am obliged to you for your frankness, and I shall bear in mind what you have said. I look forward to seeing you at dinner in an hour's time.\" M. Karkchulov bowed, and, accepting the dismissal thus conveyed, withdrew from the apartment. \" There goes a Minister\u2014 not a friend ! \" was"], [34, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 22 Prince Rodolph's comment, as the door closed after him. And then fixing bis eye upon Count Halstein, who had been a silent listener to the interview, he added in determined tones \u2014 \" To you I can speak. This is the work neither of a desperate workman nor of a rebellious Balkiard. This is the personal vengeance of \" He was interrupted. This time the door opened without a preliminary knock, and the Princess Claudine swept into the room. Ere they could speak she exclaimed \u2014 \" My son ! forgive me ! I am the one to blame for this.\""], [35, "23 CHAPTER II. PRINCESS CLAUDINE'S PLOT. \" I am the one to blame ! \" As these startling words came from the Princess, Count Halstein sprang to his feet, and made a hasty movement to withdraw. Claudine stopped him with a wave of her hand. \"Do not go, Count. I know the Prince has no secrets from you, and your advice is always worth listening to.\" \" Your Highness is too good,\" said Halstein with a respectful bow, and he resumed his former position. In the mean time the Princess had seated herself near to her son, and set herself to satisfy the amazed curiosity which her words had excited. \" My poor Rodolph ! \" she began, \" I meant to serve you, but I fear I have made a terrible mistake.\" But in order that the confession which followed may be understood, it is necessary to throw a little more light on the position which Prince Rodolph occupied in Balkistan. Vassals for centuries to the military power of a race odious to them alike for its religion and its laws, the suffering natives of Balkistan had, not many years before, made a desperate uprising against their tyrants. This rebellion was quenched in blood."], [36, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 24 Wild hordes of savage soldiery, let loose upon its revolted subjects by the barbaric Government of Constantinople, had asserted the cause of law and order with deeds of such fiendish cruelty that the public mind of Europe was stirred to its depths. The \"Balkiard atrocities,\" as they were termed, furnished a theme for the scathing eloquence of the greatest of living orators and one of the most celebrated of English statesmen; and his impassioned appeals kindled the whole civilized world into an indignation like his own. The tedious and ineffective resources of diplomacy were brought to bear on the head of the unwieldy empire of Turkey, of which Balkistan constituted a frontier province. But fortunately for the people of Balkistan their salvation did not depend on the Christian humanity of the European Powers. A far stronger and more reliable motive, that of self interest, came into play on their behalf, and brought about the intervention of the great neighbouring empire of Russia. In religion the inhabitants of Russia and Balkistan are identified. In race they are not far removed. What more natural than that the all-powerful Czar of Russia should lead his avenging armies to the succour of these victims of Turkish misgovernment ? He did so, and after a long and stubbornly contested struggle, the resistance of Turkey was crushed, and its ruler forced to accept terms of peace by which Balkistan was separated from his dominions and erected into a Principality. But the statesmen of Europe, at no time prone to place a blind confidence in each other's motives, were not quite satisfied as to the purposes of the conqueror"], [37, "PEINCESS CLAUDINE'S PLOT. 25 in this war. The head of the English Ministry at this time was a man of acute and sceptical mind, and to him, as to others, it appeared as if the real object of the Czar were less to benefit the suffering Balkiards than to aggrandize bis own vast empire. In other words, it was believed that the aim of Russia was to absorb bit by bit the whole of the territories governed from Constantinople, and ultimately to plant the Russian standards upon the walls of Constantinople itself. For this purpose the new principality of Balkistan would serve as a convenient stepping-stone, and no one doubted that it would ultimately lose any independence it possessed, and become merged in the dominions of the Russian Czar. Alarmed at such a prospect, the other Powers of Europe compelled the victorious Czar to submit his arrangements to a congress, which met in the capital of Germany. The result of its deliberations was the famous Treaty of Berlin, by which, among other things, Balkistan was divided into two provinces, the upper one retaining the name, with a quasi independent status under a ruling Prince, while the second portion was given a Turkish Governor, and placed in somewhat the same position in relation to Turkey as a self-governing colony like Canada occupies with regard to us. These changes were effected much to the chagrin of Russia, at the instance of the celebrated Minister of England. Never was political sagacity more thoroughly deceived, and its hopes and apprehen sions alike frustrated by the result. For within seven or eight years from the signing of the Treaty, the people of Balkistan had broken down the barriers set up by diplomacy, dismissed the Turkish governor"], [38, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 26 to Constantinople, and united themselves into one State; and that union, instead of being discounte nanced by England, was welcomed by its politicians, and, instead of being smiled on by Russia, became the occasion of an outburst of bitter anger on the part of the Czar. The attempts to Russianize Balkistan had indeed already failed. Prince Iskander, the ruler appointed under the Treaty of Berlin, with the approval of the Czar, had shown himself to be no mere tool in the hands of the courtiers of Petersburg. He had ven tured on more than one occasion to disregard the advice, or rather the commands, issued by the Russian Government, and he had crowned his career of insub ordination by the successful accomplishment of the national unity of Balkistan. For this the Czar swore never to forgive him, and to oaths of such a kind men are rarely wanting in fidelity. The first warning received by Iskander was a sudden invasion on the part of a petty neighbouring kingdom, the Queen-consort of which was a Russian by birth, and which was on much more cordial terms with that empire than Balkistan. The attack was repelled. Iskander, at the head of his troops, gained a complete victory over the aggressors, and, after compelling them to sue for peace, returned in triumph to his capital. Before the rejoicings over this well-deserved triumph had died away, the world was startled by hearing of the sudden abdication of Prince Iskander, in the hour when, as it seemed, he stood on the highest pinnacle of prosperity. But astonishment was changed to horror when in rapid succession the facts came out, and it was seen that the so-called abdication was really neither more nor less than a forcible"], [39, "PRINCESS CLAUDINE'S PLOT. 27 abduction, planned and executed by a faction of mal contents who made no secret of their devotion to the interests of Russia, and who were suspected of being in communication with the Government of Peters burg, and receiving supplies from its treasury. The whole circumstances of the plot were such as to point to instigation from some foreign source. In the middle of the night armed men had broken into the palace at Sufarest, seized the Prince in his bed, and dragged him off over the border into Russian territory. Nor had their outrages stopped here. It was darkly whispered that they had been guilty of the vile brutality\u2014 a brutality to which the severest penalties short of death are awarded by the criminal codes of civilized countries \u2014 of drugging their captive, and in that state extorting from the unfortunate young monarch the document which they called his abdication. From this deeply humiliating and painful position the miserable Iskander was rescued by the sponta neous action of the Balkiards themselves, who rose against the conspirators, expelled them from the position they had usurped, and restored their Prince in triumph. But though thus speedily delivered, his nerve seemed to have been destroyed by the terrible experience he had gone through. He made a journey to Petersburg to tender an apologetic submission to the Czar. It was even said that he had flung him self on the ground at his enemy's feet, and humiliated himself in a manner which could be excused only on the supposition that his mind had been affected, either by the shock of his recent experience, or by the physical operation of the poison administered to him. But he east himself on the mercy of the despot"], [40, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 28 in vain. When he found that a reconciliation was impossible, he forsook his uneasy elevation without a further struggle, abdicating in the hope, as he declared, that this course would secure the Balkiards as a people from the enmity of their powerful neighbour. The hope so expressed had been disappointed. The Czar had made use of every decent pretext, and of some which did not deserve that description, to keep Balkistan in, or rather to reduce it to, a state of dis order, as if to create a necessity for his own interven tion in its government. When, after a long period of trouble and suspense, the vacant throne was offered, with the approval of all the other Powers, to Rodolph, a prince of an ancient royal stock, the Czar had interposed a diplomatic veto, and put forward as an alternative candidate an obscure Tartar chieftain, a dependent creature of his own. Rodolph, with a courage which won him the hearts of his new subjects and the good wishes of every honest man in Europe, had proceeded to Sufarest in spite of the imperial bully, and had been enthroned amid the delighted acclamations of the Balkiards. Their deepest wish was now to be let alone by their formidable patron, whose relations with them were, as they were beginning to feel, \" A little more than kin, and less than kind.\" Rodolph had not been long on the throne before he began to realize the dangerous character of the enmity which he had thus provoked. In addition to the party in the Deputschin which openly worked for the union, as they termed it, of Russia and Balkistan, he had to face the silent but steady"], [41, "PRINCESS CLAUDINE'S PLOT. 29 hostihty of the Church, the priesthood of which looked to the Czar as the chief supporter of their religion. Under the surface other factions were suspected to be at work, and one abortive insurrection against Rodolph's government had already taken place. Meanwhile, by persisting in his veto on the Prince's election, and bringing pressure to bear on his Turkish suzerain, the Czar was doing his best to render Rodolph's position untenable in the face of the public law of Europe. Such, briefly summed up, were the circumstances present in the minds of the three persons now in consultation in the Prince's cabinet. Princess Claudine proceeded to explain her extra ordinary declaration. \"You know, Rodolph,\" she began, addressing her son, \"that some time ago I told you I had in my mind a scheme for putting an end to the interference of Russia in your affairs.\" \" I remember. But you declined to take me into your confidence, on the ground that you did not wish to compromise me.\" \" Yes. I almost wish now I had consulted you. But how was I to foresee that things would turn out as they have done ? However, I must now teU you all. To begin with, as I have tried to impress upon you so often already, there is no middle course for you to take in your situation. You have defied the Czar by coming here, it is against his interest to have any one here but a mere tool of Russia, and consequently he will never willingly reconcile himself to your government. Put that out of your mind at once and for all.\" \" I have,\" replied the Prince with a bitter emphasis,"], [42, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 30 \" and what is more, I do not want to be reconciled with him. You will never find me entertaining that idea again.\" His mother nodded approvingly. \" That makes it easier for me to tell my story. I had long ago come to that conclusion, and to the other which follows from it, namely, that your position will never be secure, even your life will not be safe, until we have succeeded in doing something to cripple the Czar's power for mischief.\" \"I recognize that too,\" said Rodolph, gloomily. \" But how ? \u2014 that is the question.\" \"It is that question which I set myself to solve. I will tell you exactly what I did. After making certain preparations, I went, as you will recollect, at the beginning of last month to visit your uncle, the Comte de Blois.\" It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that the personage thus designated was the head of the ancient royal family of France, and claimant of the French throne. The Princess Claudine was a member of this influential House, whose fortunes have been so singularly chequered, and in her time she had played an important part in the secret intrigues which it has been carrying on for half a century with the object of regaining its lost crown. She it was who had proceeded by midnight express to the French capital, at one memorable crisis, had waited in disguise upon the wavering head of the Republican government, and had so nearly seduced him from his allegiance by offers which were said to have included a royal bridegroom for his only daughter. Accustomed from her childhood to breathe the atmosphere of this underground diplomacy, it was"], [43, "PEINCESS CLAUDINE'S PLOT. 31 not surprising that Claudine should have resorted to the familiar weapons in the defence of her son. Knowing that in such man\u0153uvres the essence of success is secrecy, she had not disclosed anything of her purposes to Rodolph beforehand, and hence she was obliged to go into some detail now. \"At the castle,\" she proceeded, \"I found your cousin MathiLde, who is really a most charming girl, and who inquired after you with great interest.\" At the mention of this Princess's name, Rodolph looked up eagerly, and seemed about to say some thing. But Claudine went on without leaving him time to speak. \" I at once took her into counsel. As you may remember, she is rather a favourite of Iskander III., and it was some time before I could convince her of the odious nature of his conduct towards you.\" (Iskander III. was the name of the reigning Czar.) \" In the end I got her to admit that it was essential for your safety that the power of Russia should in some way be crippled, though she still believed it was rather the Ministers than the Czar himself who were responsible for what had happened. As soon as I had got her to this point, I threw off the mask boldly, and asked her if she would take part in the scheme I had in view. \"I explained to her that there were only two powers in existence which could seriously threaten the Czar. One of these was the Nihilists \u2014 \" \"Ah!\" cried Rodolph, as if a light had sud denly broken into his mind. \" I never thought of them.\" \" Of course not. It would be out of the question for members of our family to hold intercourse with"], [44, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 32 such men,\" replied the Princess. \" My brother would never permit it. But as I was going to say, the other is the Empire of Germany.\" \"But Germany and Russia are close allies,\" said Rodolph, interrupting again. \" Prince Bismarck \" \u2014 he referred to the then chief Minister of Germany \u2014 \" has done his utmost to cement their relations.\" \"True. That is exactly what Mathilde said when I broached the matter to her. My answer to her was to produce two letters, in Bismarck's well known handwriting, addressed to you, offering you his friendship and support, and explicitly promising that Germany should draw the sword if Balkistan were threatened by the Russians. Now do you understand? \" Prince Rodolph gazed at his mother in unaffected bewilderment. \" But those letters must have been forgeries ! I never received anything of the kind from Prince Bismarck ! \" Princess Claudine shrugged her shoulders. \"Whether forgeries or not,\" she replied coolly, \"they completely imposed on Mathilde. I gave them into her charge, without saying how they had come into my possession, and explained what I wished her to do with them. As you know, Iskander III. was at that very time on a private visit to the King of Denmark. My plan was for Mathilde to go there, and take advantage of her friendship with the Czar to place these letters before him, inflame his mind as much as possible against Bismarck, and thus pave the way to a breach between Russia and Germany.\" It was with mixed feelings that Rodolph had"], [45, "PEINCESS CLAUDINE'S PLOT. 33 listened so far. At the first pause in his mother's narrative, he interposed \u2014 \"But, my dear mother \u2014 pardon my speaking so freely before Count Halstein, since you wished him to be present \u2014 how can you possibly justify the use of such documents when you must have known that they were \u2014 \" he checked himself, and altered the turn ofthe sentence \u2014 \"when you could not possibly have believed that they were genuine ? \" The Princess seemed a little taken aback by this reproach. \" Well, Rodolph, I hardly expected you to find fault with my strategy. Bismarck himself would have been the last man to complain, for everybody knows that he forged the telegram which led to the Franco-German war. Of course I know it would be considered very shocking in one's private affairs, but in matters of State it is quite another thing. Besides, how else are you to fight against a power like that of Russia ? Is a forged letter worse than drugging and kidnapping \u2014 not to speak of assassination ? \" The Prince started and exchanged meaning glances with his mother, and then with Count Halstein, who had listened keenly to every word of this dialogue. To him Claudine now turned for the first time \u2014 \" What do you say, Count ? Are not all means justifiable against such wretches ? \" \" All things are lawful, your Royal Highness, but all things are not expedient,\" he answered quietly, quoting the Scripture. \" I agree with the Prince in thinking that it was an imprudent step. Your Royal Highness will pardon my speaking so plainly.\" The Princess bowed coldly. n"], [46, "34 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. \"Your Royal Highness sees,\" he added, \"that at such weapons we must in the long run be beaten by the Russians themselves. Then- secret police is the most powerful and unscrupulous that the world has ever seen, and we have had more than one illustra tion in Balkistan of its peculiar methods. With their vast resources both in men and money, and the additional facilities given to them in their work, by the protection of a great military power like Russia's, they are certain ultimately to achieve their purpose. What will be the result? You\" \u2014 turning to Prince Rodolph \u2014 \" will fall like Iskander, and you will forfeit all claims to the public sympathy by having yourself resorted to the weapons by which you have been worsted.\" \"And pray, what do you suggest instead?\" in quired Claudine, who had listened impatiently to this speech. \" Let us devote ourselves to obtaining clear and unmistakable proofs of the complicity of the Russian Government in these intrigues, and then appeal to a European Congress for protection.\" He spoke like a man who had carefully thought out his position, and both his listeners turned and looked at each other as if they were impressed by the advice. Rodolph was the first to speak. \" The idea is a good one,\" he said, \"if it does not come too late. But we have not yet heard the end of my mother's story.\" Claudine, thus appealed to, resumed the thread of her discourse. \" Mathilde was somewhat alarmed at first by my proposal. Between ourselves, Rodolph, I think you"], [47, "PEINCESS CLAUDINE'S PLOT. 35 owe it to something a little stronger than cousinly regard that she at last consented to do what I asked.\" Rodolph blushed ever so slightly, and for the first time since his entering the palace, a smile of pleasure crossed his face, to be quickly succeeded by a renewal of his former gloom. \"I am a terrible match-maker, as you know,\" added the Princess, trying to rouse him to a more cheerful mood, \" and I will not deny that I hinted to Mathilde that if once your position were rendered a Uttle more secure it would be time for you to look out for a beautiful young queen, who would present the Balkiards with an heir to the throne, born on the soil of Balkistan.\" The Prince nodded his head, and turning to Halstein, remarked \u2014 \" This time I think you will not venture to criticise the Princess Claudine's diplomacy.\" The secretary responded by a sympathetic smile. \"However, to do her justice, Mathilde had con sented to undertake the mission before I said any thing of that sort,\" resumed the Princess. \"It only remained for me to use my influence with her father to get him to permit the journey; while Mathilde herself undertook the task of arranging the visit with the Danes, with whom she has always been a great favourite.\" \"She is a favourite with every one,\" observed Rodolph. \"And she deserves to be. But I am impatient to hear how she got on in Denmark.\" \"She shall tell you in her own words. Here is the letter which I received from her after she had been there a week.\""], [48, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 36 And Claudine took out some sheets of delicate per fumed note-paper, and read aloud : \u2014 \"Strictly Confidential. \" The Castle, Elsinore, Sunday. \" My dearest Aunt, \"No doubt you are beginning to feel impatient at not hearing from me, but I have really not had a moment to myself since I arrived, until to-day. This morning I rose early and attended Mass, so as to be free when the others were at their terrible Lutheran services. I suppose I had better say as little as possible about the Eastern Church, as there is no knowing how soon I may have to become a convert. I allude to the attentions of H.I. H. Grand Duke Peter, who has been following me about like a dog ever since I arrived, and would undoubtedly have given rise to the coupling of our names in the news papers but for his age, which is just seven. \"I need not assure you I have not neglected the business that brought me here. I found Iskander III. most friendly. He made no reference to Rodolph or you, and I was careful not to introduce the subject. I thought it better not to refer to politics at all the first day or two, till I could feel my way. He danced with me twice the first night, and the next morning, when we all went for a ride, I had him by my side for more than an hour. \"Dear old King Frederick is so kind, and so is the Queen. They asked most kindly after papa and you, but they did not mention Rodolph's name. I fancy they look upon him as in some sort of disgrace just at present, and you know they stand in great awe of Iskander.

They say the eldest is going to marry a common nobleman, and that it is quite a love match. The papers have not found it out yet, so taisez-vous. \"As for Iskander, he is quite charming. I can hardly beheve that he really knows all about all those dreadful things, when I see him playing with the children here, and enjoying himself like a great boy. Their favourite game is to get him to stand with his feet firmly planted on the ground, while all the youngsters swarm round him and try to pull him over. They hardly ever succeed. The cry is always for ' Uncle Sika,' and I am getting into the trick of calling him Uncle Sika myself. If those wretched Nihilists and people who are always plotting against him could only see him as he is here, I am sure they would leave off. \" You must not think I have forgotten my mission all this time. I spoke to him on the third day I was here, alone in the garden. I led up to it very guardedly by asking how long he was going to stay. He said he had arranged to leave in about three weeks, and then I asked him if it was true that he had promised to pass through Germany on his way home. He said it was so, that when Wilhelm II. was in Petersburg last year he had promised to return the visit. I saw my chance, and said \u2014 \"'Ah, but haven't things changed in that quarter since then ? '"], [50, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 38 \" ' What do you mean ?

' I can only say that, so far as I know, the relations between Wilhelm and myself are perfectly cordial.' '\"Ah, yes, no doubt. But I was referring to M. Bismarck. He doesn't always think it necessary to take the Emperor of Germany into his confidence, does he ? ' \" With this parting shot I slipped away, and left the hint to sink into his mind. I thought it better that the next approach should come from him, and I knew that if he once began he would never rest till he had got to the bottom of the mystery. \" My explanation turned out to be correct. That very evening he spoke to me about it, and asked me whether I was serious. He said \u2014 \" ' I have always had the greatest confidence in M. Bismarck, because he has always been perfectly straightforward in his conduct towards me. For this reason, I do not like to have it even hinted that there is anything behind the scenes.' \" I at once pretended to be very frightened, and told him I was sorry I had spoken. Having gone so far, I said, I could not withdraw, and I had reason to believe that M.

I could hardly keep from crying, I was so upset. After this I begin to under stand how it is that he treated poor Iskander of Balkistan so badly, and is ready to do the same by Rodolph if he is allowed. \"I have only been alone with him once since then. He has tried to conciliate me by showing every possible attention, but I can never trust him again.

Prince Rodolph rose and offered his arm to the Princess, and they proceeded to the banqueting hall, followed by Count Halstein, the party being augmented in the corridor by a lady in attendance on Princess Claudine. At the banquet Rodolph had his mother on his right, and Monsignor Stefan on the left. The prelate pronounced a formal benediction, and the repast began. As soon as the first course had been disposed of, Monsignor Stefan turned to the Prince, and addressed him on the subject of Simski's attempt. \"M. Karkchulov tells me that your Highness has examined the wretched creature who fired into the carriage. Perhaps I may be permitted to express a hope that he turned out to be some miserable lunatic.\" The Prince frowned almost imperceptibly. \"It is too soon to say. The preliminary examina tion revealed nothing of importance.\" \"Ah!\" The prelate drew a gentle breath, which might have been one of relief or of disappointment."], [58, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 46 \" The reason why I ventured to refer to the subject was because I did not feel quite sure whether his bullet might not have been intended for myself.\" Prince Rodolph elevated his eyebrows. \" Indeed ! If he had any intention of injuring your Grace, the fellow must have been the worst marksman I ever saw in my life,\" he answered dryly. The moment the words were out of his mouth the Prince regretted them. He felt that he had allowed the ecclesiastic to see that his explanation was not believed. The suggestion on the face of it had seemed insincere, but since the Bishop had thought fit to make it, from whatever motive, it was impolitic to receive it with sarcasm. Prince Rodolph had some reason to regard Mon signor Stefan as his enemy. As a professed friend of Russia, and one connected ecclesiastically with its hierarchy, the Bishop of Sufarest could not be supposed to feel much friendship for a Prince brought up in another communion, and regarded with dis favour by the orthodox Czar. He had been freely accused of participation in the seditious intrigues which had brought about the fall of Iskander; and be had made difficulties about recognizing the official position of Prince Rodolph, pretending that he was controlled by his religious superior, the Primate of Russia, who was, of course, a mere puppet in the hands of the Czar. As the banquet progressed Rodolph sought to undo his mistake by entering into friendly talk with the Bishop. At the same time Princess Claudine was putting forth all the fascination of which she was past mistress to conciliate the statesmen and nobles who were seated within reach of her attentions."], [59, "A DECLAEATION OF WAE. 47 It was a representative gathering. In addition to the chiefs of the Balkiard aristocracy, and the leading members of the Government, the national parliament was well represented, and the representatives of foreign countries, with one significant exception, were in attendance. That exception was the Consul-General of Russia, M. Nelidoff, and not a few meaning looks and shrugs were exchanged by the Consuls of the other Powers, as they noted the omission. Being nominally under the suzerainty of Turkey, the Envoy of which Govern ment was there in his Oriental robes of state, Balkistan was not entitled to receive ambassadors or envoys direct from foreign courts. Their place was supplied by an inferior class of diplomatic agents who passed under the name of Consuls. But the Czar of Russia having refused to recognize Rodolph as the lawful sovereign of the country, his agent in Sufarest was strictly forbidden to take part in any function in the Prince's honour. It may be asked what reason there was for M. Nelidoff's presence in Sufarest at all, under such circumstances. That was one of the problems which Prince Rodolph made up his mind to solve as he glanced around the banqueting chamber and observed the vacant place in the diplomatic ranks. But as if to encourage Prince Rodolph under the oppressive circumstances by which he felt himself surrounded, his eye fell upon one figure in the banqueting hall, who had been the object of general observation since his entrance. This was Lord Danvers, a nobleman from England, who professed to be travelling through Balkistan for his private pleasure, but who was generally believed"], [60, "48 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. to be the bearer of unofficial congratulations from his Court to the Prince of Balkistan. It was well-known that the people of England, who had no reason to love the Russians, regarded the prosperity of the Balkiards with a friendly eye. In addition, it so happened that an alliance had recently taken place between the family of the deposed Prince Iskander and the English royal family, one of his brothers having married a daughter of the Queen. The Queen was a sovereign who, though restricted by custom from open interference in public affairs, took a very keen and active interest in European politics, and it was said that she had resolved to show her detestation of the vile intrigue by which Iskander had been unseated, by extending her countenance and sympathy to his successor. In fact, the presence of Lord Danvers was regarded as a tacit expression of approval on the part of Prince Iskander himself ; and the popularity which that un fortunate Prince had won among the Balkiards made his friendliness a matter of no small moment to his successor. As soon as the feast drew to a close, Prince Rodolph rose, and, accompanied as before by his mother and their two immediate attendants, retired from the hall. A minute later Count Halstein was seen to return alone, and to enter into a whispered colloquy with the English nobleman. Presently he rose in turn, and the two went out together. M. Karkchulov, whose jealousy of his master's confidence in foreigners has already been noticed, watched their departure with a suspicious eye. He would have been still more displeased had he been able to listen to the conversation which now took"], [61, "A DECLARATION OF WAE. 49 place in the cabinet to which Count Halstein had conducted the Englishman. Princess Claudine having gone to her own apart ments, the Prince received them alone. \"Come in, my lord,\" he said cordially. \"I was pleased to see you present to-night. Your visit will have a most beneficial effect on the public mind ; and I trust that, when you are obliged to leave us, you will convey the expression of my warmest gratitude to the Queen for having permitted you to come.\" Lord Danvers bowed low. \" Will your Highness permit me to offer my respect ful congratulations on your providential escape this afternoon from the pistol of that ruffian,\" he said. \" I know that her Majesty will hear of the incident with the greatest concern and sympathy.\" \"I am obliged to you, my lord. I was about to introduce that very subject, as it is one on which you may possibly feel inclined to favour me with your advice.\" \"Your Highness does me too much honour,\" ex claimed the Englishman with eagerness. \" I should be proud indeed if it were in my power to be of the smallest service in your affairs.\" The Prince looked at him steadily for some moments. \" Before I ask you anything as to the opinion which you may have yourself formed upon the incident, I had better tell you what has been elicited by the examination of the man himself. M. Karkchulov had him brought round to the palace immediately after his capture, and I was present while he was being questioned. He says his name is Simski, and that he is a Russian subject.\" As he pronounced the last two words the Prince E"], [62, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 50 fixed his eye upon Lord Danvers, and was rewarded by seeing a frown come upon his listener's face. \" He further stated that he was a jeweller from Odessa, out of work, and that he fired the pistol simply for the purpose of attracting attention to his hopeless condition. He gave us references to his late employer in Russia, and the police are now engaged, under the direction of M. Karkchulov, in inquiring into the truth of this story.\" The Prince paused, and then, keeping his eye upon the English emissary, he added \u2014 \" What do you say to this ? \" Lord Danvers looked slightly embarrassed. \" Your Highness has put a question to me which it is rather difficult for me to answer with discretion unless I know \u2014 pardon my being so abrupt \u2014 some thing more of the purpose your Highness has in view in honouring me with this conference.\" Rodolph glanced at his secretary as if seeking his approval for the words he was about to utter, and then, turning back to Lord Danvers, he said \u2014 \"I should like to be perfectly frank with you, provided that there is nothing in your duty to the Queen to prevent your accepting my confidence. I know your countrymen to be my friends, and it is for that reason that I have asked you to let me consult you upon a matter which I regard as my own personal concern, rather than a political question \u2014 one in which I should be bound to be guided by my own Ministers. But, unless you feel yourself a perfectly free agent, I should not wish to embarrass you with a confidence which might prove inconvenient to one on whom I have no claim.\""], [63, "A DECLARATION OF WAE. 51 The Englishman listened quietly to these remarks, and answered without a moment's hesitation \u2014 \"I am here in a private capacity, as your High ness is aware ; and the messages with which I have been charged do not in the least forbid me to enter into any other business which might be undertaken by a private gentleman. I can, therefore, only say that I feel that no greater honour could be offered me than to be allowed the privilege of receiving your Highness's confidence. Perhaps I am not unprepared for the communication which you are about to make.\" And he glanced at Prince Rodolph as if to read in his face the suspicion which he himself had already formed. Rodolph brightened visibly at this reply. \" I see that you have already entertained the idea which has been forced upon me and upon the Count here,\" he said ; \"you see, as we do, through the flimsy veil by which it is intended to deceive the public. This is the handiwork \" \"Of Russia,\" put in the Englishman quietly, in answer to the implied question of the Prince. There was a long pause, which Rodolph was the first to break. \"You have come to that conclusion, no doubt, from your knowledge of the events which have been made public during the last few years ? \" \" I have. We in England have watched the affairs of Balkistan closely for some time, and I beheve I speak the sentiment of my countrymen in saying that we regard the course pursued by the Russian Govern ment with feelings of disgust and detestation. It is quite evident that the Czar does not mean to rest until he has made the government of Balkistan by"], [64, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 52 an independent prince impossible ; though of course I am far from attributing to his Majesty any personal share in the disgraceful plots of which we have just had a specimen.\" Prince Rodolph smiled. \" I thought you would say that. I do not wonder that it should be difficult for any honourable man to credit that a great monarch should stoop to methods unworthy of the head of a gang of robbers. But I have to tell you that since the event of this afternoon I have been made aware that, in addition to his political motives for seeking to dethrone me, the Czar probably considers that he has a right to regard me with personal enmity. I cannot say more than that ; but I fear that he would not think it necessary to shrink from any means, however unworthy, to get rid of me.\" The Englishman looked troubled. \" I admit that I was hardly prepared to go as far as that,\" he answered ; \" I should have thought that, after the odium aroused by the kidnapping of Prince Iskander, he would have hardly dared, whatever might have been his wishes, to provoke the public opinion of Europe by another outrage such as this.\" Prince Rodolph rose to his feet and spoke with more excitement of manner than he had yet shown. \"Undeceive yourself, my lord; the Czar cares nothing for the public opinion of Europe. He is impregnable. Throned amid his ice and snow, bar ricaded by the rigour of the elements, far beyond the reach of civilized armies, guarded even then by four million soldiers, who only ask to die for him, secured from conscientious scruples by his position as head of one of the great Churches of Christendom, ruler of"], [65, "A DECLARATION OF WAE. 53 the bodies and souls of one hundred million slaves, what has the Czar of Russia to fear ? He has escaped the Nihilists, and if a desperate and numerous body of men like that, who have devoted their lives to his destruction, have failed to reach him, what other enemy need he take into account? I repeat, he is impregnable. He may be defeated outside his own dominions, he may be prevented from advancing further, but there the power of England or of all his other enemies ends. The greatest conqueror since the days of Alexander the Great came to grief in invading Russia, and that, too, when it had scarcely half its present resources. No, it is useless to think of restraining him. The Czar is irresistible, and from the height of his savage security he wreaks his vengeance on those who offend him, with the atrocity of a barbarian, the ruthlessness of an Eastern despot, and the low cunning of a European criminal.\" Exhausted by his outburst Prince Rodolph sank back upon his seat. Lord Danvers' face reflected his indignation. \"But surely something can be done?\" he said, as soon as the Prince had finished speaking. \"It is a scandal to Christendom that such deeds should be perpetrated without any effort to put a stop to them. The other Powers ought to make common cause against a system which threatens the security of the whole world. Who can tell whom the Czar will select for his next victim ? \" Count Halstein waited a moment for his master to answer, and then interposed \u2014 \" That is the point. It appears to me, if I may venture to say so, that the only safe course for his Highness to take is to first gather decisive evidence,"], [66, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 54 if such can be obtained, of the complicity of the Russian Government in this latest crime of its agents, and then to lay the proofs before a European Congress and shame the Powers into action.\" Rodolph shook his head with an air of sadness. \"I wish I could think it possible to succeed in such a course,\" he replied. \" But, in the mean time, I agree as to the first part of the programme; we must sift this affair to its foundation, and not be put off with the childish pretences which imposed on M \" \u2014 he checked himself, and then continued \u2014 \" on those who, either from fear or a mistaken sense of duty, would rather not learn the truth. It is for this reason that I have sent for you, my lord,\" he went on, turning to the Englishman. \" In the first place, I can have no confidence in the ability of a raw set of men like the Balkiard police; they are quite unfitted for grappling with the astuteness of the Russians. In the second place, I cannot feel sure that those under whose authority they act would encourage them to ferret out a secret which, in their opinion, might be dangerous to the peace of Balkistan. It has occurred to me that you might be able to secure me the services of a really competent member of your own detective force, who would be willing to come here and devote himself to the investigation. Even if he did not succeed, I should at least have the assurance that one of your countrymen would not be held back by any fear of consequences, nor do I think that he would be ready to accept the bribes of the Russian Government.\" Lord Danvers smiled confidently, as he answered, \"I am delighted with your Highness's proposal. I believe I can put my hand upon the very man you"], [67, "A DECLARATION OF WAE. 55 require. His name is Verriter, and he is as able a diplomatist as he is a detective. I believe he has been in every country in the world at one time or another. In fact, it is generally he who accompanies the Queen when she goes abroad. I doubt if he knows the Balkiard language, but he is certainly familiar with the Russian, so I imagine it will not take him long to master the other. From what I have heard of him, a more trustworthy man it would be impossible to find, and he is absolutely fearless.\" \"That is the very man I want,\" cried Rodolph, looking more cheerful than he had yet done that evening. \" May I trust to your kindness to send him here, of course in disguise, the very moment you are back in England?\" \"I will do so,\" said the other, rising to take his departure, \" and, moreover, as I have really nothing to keep me longer in Sufarest, I will start, with your Highness's permission, to-morrow morning.\" \" Come, I did not mean to suggest any hastening of your departure,\" answered Rodolph, courteously, though he scarcely took the trouble to conceal the pleasure the other's proposal afforded him. \" The honour of serving your Highness will be the best compensation for leaving your capital,\" was the courtly reply. \" One moment,\" said Count Halstein as the envoy was withdrawing. \" Would it not be a wise precaution to arrange a password by which to recognize this officer when he presents himself?\" \" Thanks, Halstein, your suggestion is a good one. Have you any word in your mind ? \" \" Cm bono.\" An expressive nod on the part of the Prince signified"], [68, "56 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. his acceptance ; and the interview closed by the exit of Lord Danvers. As soon as he was gone, Rodolph again got on to bis feet, and, raising himself up to his full height, he exclaimed \u2014 \" Now, Halstein, the die is cast ! I shall go through with this thing to the bitter end. If I can get the support of the Powers, well and good; if not, I do not care if I have to resort to the Nihilists themselves. One thing I am determined upon \u2014 I will not be the passive victim that poor Iskander was. The Czar has struck the first blow, but it will not be the last in this contest. He has declared war, and though he is a mighty emperor and I am a humble prince, it shall never be said that Rodolph of Balkistan shrank from his enemy. From this moment I have cast aside all scruples, and I will go forward till I have taught this Czar the lesson which his insolence deserves.\""], [69, "57 CHAPTER IV. EZEKIEL P. BAXTER. The attempt on the life of the Prince of Balkistan created a sensation from one corner of Europe to the other. Flashed by the electric wire to the various capitals, the first meagre account of the outrage had only stimulated curiosity, and even left it doubtful how far the work of the assassin had been successful. Subsequent messages set the public mind at ease on this point, but left the veil of mystery unlisted over the motives and character, of the criminal. The result of the private examination of Simski was not at once allowed to transpire, and every one was left to form his own conjectures as to the truth of the affair. Some of the longer-headed or the more suspicious statesmen of the continent were not slow to see in this event something which smacked of the same hand as the notorious outrage on Prince Iskander. But, of course, they kept any such suspicions to themselves. Even the most outspoken journals did not venture on so slight a foundation to make any open reference to the hostility known to exist towards the new ruler of Balkistan on the part of the Czar of Russia. Comments of other kinds were rife ; and discussion"], [70, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 58 of the sensational episode was at its height, when the facts about Simski began to leak out, and the state ment that he was a Russian subject provoked not a few strong hints of dark dealing on the part of the Government of Petersburg. But the effect thus produced soon died away, and when the simple and plausible story of the prisoner came to be known in all its details, it gradually won acceptance. The public of Europe were not so thoroughly alive to Russian methods as to be proof against an explanation which saved trouble, and spared them the disagreeable consciousness of cowardice in the presence of a great international crime. The press by degrees grew languid in its interest in the matter, the telegrams despatched by Messrs. Reuter from Sufarest grew shorter in volume, and gradually passed from the most conspicuous columns of the papers to their back pages, till finally they ceased altogether. The episode faded from the minds of all but a few, and so far as public opinion was concerned Prince Rodolph was left to his fate. In the mean time he was not without such services as the national authorities at Sufarest were capable of rendering. As soon as their prisoner was safe under lock and key, the Balkiard police had commenced a pains taking investigation into his character and past, aided by the materials furnished in his confession. To be sure, they were not very expert in the niceties of the detective art ; but then, as yet they had had little opportunity of gaining experience. In semi civilized countries the difficulty is usually less to trace the perpetrators of a crime, than to punish them when discovered. The arm of justice is short,"], [71, "EZEKIEL P. BAXTEE. 59 but when it can strike, there is not much trouble in selecting its objects. Only the prevalence of political intrigue during the past few years had rendered it necessary to call into existence a body of spies, whose duty it was to watch on behalf of the Government the proceedings of the disaffected. These men, who honoured their calling with the name of \" detective,\" were set to work on the trail of the man Simski. His lodging in the Place Debransch was searched, and inquiries were made at the places where it seemed possible to obtain light on the truth of his account of himself. At the end of these labours an elaborate report was drawn up and submitted to the Chief of Police for the city of Sufarest. That functionary read it through with a smile of satisfaction at the admirable manner in which his subordinates had done their work, affixed his sig nature, and carried the document to the Minister of the Interior. The Minister of the Interior went through it with great care, appended his own signature, and carried it in triumph to M. Karkchulov. The Prime Minister read it in turn, felt, or affected to feel, equal satisfaction, countersigned it, and bore it off with his own hands to lay before the Prince. By the time he reached the palace with this important State paper its contents were generally known to the people of Sufarest, and were being freely discussed in the cafes, where it was on all hands taken for granted that the Simski affair was now closed. M. Karkchulov did not feel quite so easy as to that in his own mind, after certain expressions which had fallen from his master on the former occasion when"], [72, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 60 they had discussed the matter. However, he entered the royal cabinet with an air of well-assumed con fidence. The Prime Minister found Prince Rodolph busily engaged in other matters. A vast quantity of measures for the development of the country were being mooted, and the post of Prince of Balkistan was no sinecure. There were concessions for new railways to be granted, taxes to be regulated, con cessions for water navigation, mining concessions, and a number of other schemes to be inquired into. Balkistan, as a new country, requiring only capital for its development, had attracted the attention of the financiers of the world; and a horde of greedy speculators from all parts were descending upon this favoured region, anxious to devote their energies to developing its resources, of course for the benefit of the nation in the first place, but also with an eye to some little private profit for themselves, in the second. \"Well, M. Karkchulov?\" said the Prince, looking up from his labours, as the other was announced. \" Do you bring news of anything fresh ? \" \" I have just had the report of the police in the Simski affair,\" replied the Minister; \" and I thought your Highness would like to hear about it at once.\" Rodolph had banished the whole business from his mind, pending the arrival of his ally from England, and he had really forgotten that the Balkiard police were exerting themselves according to their lights in the investigation. It was therefore with unaffected surprise that he heard this announcement. He at once responded \u2014"], [73, "EZEKIEL P. BAXTER. 61 \" Ah ! certainly ; you are very good to take so much trouble. Pray be seated, and tell me all they have discovered.\" M. Karkchulov hardly knew what to make of this seeming indifference. He had expected a very dif ferent reception. Rut he was much too prudent to refer to past matters. \"I have brought the papers here,\" he said, \"but as the report is rather exhaustive, perhaps I had better tell your Highness the results briefly. In substance they go to confirm the story of the prisoner.\" \" Quite so. I shall be glad if you will give it me briefly, as you suggest,\" responded the Prince calmly, with a note of irony in his tone, which the Minister failed to perceive. \" In the first place, they searched the prisoner's room, at the address given by him, and found a letter addressed to Simski Simskivitch, giving him a good character as a worker in jewellery, and signed ' Otto Ripmann.' The police at Odessa were at once telegraphed to, and they have answered. It appears that this Otto Ripmann is a highly respect able goldsmith, of Dutch extraction, who has carried on business at Odessa for many years. He had a workman of this name, who had been in his employ ment some little time, but who had left him about three months ago, partly because his habits were a little irregular, and also because the man asserted that he could get better wages elsewhere.\" \" So far, so good. To put it shortly, the Russian police confirm his account of himself.\" \" The most exhaustive researches have been made in Sufarest, but without finding a particle of evidence"], [74, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 62 to connect any one here with the prisoner. With the exception of the testimonial from Ripmann, there was not a scrap of writing to be found any where in his apartment. Every wall has been sounded, every plank in the flooring taken up, every piece of furniture, no matter how unpromising in appearance, has been tested and examined, but all with no result. The other occupants of the house, none of whom are known to the police, but who are all favourably spoken of by their neighbours and business friends, have been minutely questioned, but they have not been able to tell the police anything of importance. The man appears not to have been in the habit of speaking to any one ; he passed in and out, and there was nothing in his behaviour to attract attention.\" \" Is not all this a little useless ? \" put in Rodolph, at this point. \" Suppose we pass over the account of what the police have not discovered concerning this man, and come to the things which they have found ; if they have found anything.\" \"I am sorry if I weary your Highness,\" replied M. Karkchulov, a little nettled by the interruption, \"but I thought it my duty to satisfy you that no pains have been spared in the investigation, and that there is really no possibility of going any further.\" The Prince shrugged his shoulders, but did not speak. \" However, there is not much more to tell your Highness. It appears that the man had applied for work to one or two of the Sufarest goldsmiths, and had failed to obtain it. The police have fur ther ascertained that Simski was in the habit of"], [75, "EZEKIEL P. BAXTER. 63 frequenting the St. Stefan tavern, which is situated at the rear of the cafe of that name.\" Rodolph pricked up his ears. \" It seems to me that I have heard something of that cafe before,\" he observed. \"Is it not a sort of headquarters for M. Schoffzan's party ? \" M. Schoffzan was well known as the leader of that party of members of the legislature which aimed more or less openly at the incorporation of their country with the Russian empire. Although neither in their aims nor in any other respect did they re semble the Irish Nationalist party in our House of Commons, they were like them in working by con stitutional means to effect a purpose which was being aimed at at the same time by a more concealed group who employed very different weapons. M. Karkchulov, to whom these facts were of course familiar, saw the drift of Prince Rodolph's question, and replied \u2014 \" Undoubtedly M. Schoffzan is frequently to be found at the St. Stefan, and so also is M. Nelidoff \" \u2014 this was the name of the Russian Consul-General, whose absence at the recent banquet had excited so much remark. \"But attendance at the cafe is by no means confined to politicians. It is a popular fashionable resort, and some of the leading men among the foreign financiers who have come to Sufarest are to be found there.\" To this statement the Prince could make no reply. He waited for his Minister to proceed. \" That is, I think, all I have to tell your Highness. You will see that it substantially corroborates the fellow's own story, and the question now is what we ought to do with him.\""], [76, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 64 Rodolph looked thoughtful, aud paused for some time before answering \u2014 \" So far the position is unchanged, as you say. I have no doubt the police have done their best, and of course it may he that you are right in supposing the affair to be a very simple; one. Still, I do not wish to regard the inquiry as altogether closed If there were nothing more in it I should not care to see the man punished, further than by expulsion from the Balkiard territory. For the present, how ever, I desire that he may he kept in confinement, without any person being allowed to communicate with him. Should nothing more be discovered during the next few months, he can be released on the terms I have stated.\" The Minister bowed, and prepared to withdraw, pleased on the whole that the affair seemed likely to pass over so well. Prince Rodolph checked his departure. Turning over some of the papers on the table before him, he said \u2014 \" Speaking of foreign financiers, I have this morn ing received a memorial from an American capitalist who is anxious to prospect for antimony in the moun tains round Sagratz. He asks for an exclusive concession of the mines in that district for twenty years, and offers a royalty of thirty per cent, on the net proceeds. Do you know anything about him?\" \" Your Highness has not mentioned his name ? \" \" Mr. Baxter\u2014 Ezekiel P. Baxter.\" M. Karkchulov smiled ironically. \"Oh, I have heard of that gentleman. He has only just arrived. He came here from Petersburg, and has taken a suite of rooms at the place we were"], [77, "EZEKIEL P.BAXTER. 65 just mentioning\u2014 the St. Stefan. Perhaps he is one of the conspirators.\" The Prince looked a little annoyed at this sarcasm. He took no notice of it in his next question \u2014 \" Have you ever heard anything that would lead you to suppose there was much antimony in the district ? \" \" I am really not in possession of any information on that subject. But I will cause inquiries to be made. In any case, I should think it need only be a question of terms. We are bound to give every encouragement to these sort of people. The more they develop our resources the more the country must benefit in the end.\" \" Quite so. Mr. Baxter asks in the memorial to be allowed to wait upon me, but I hardly see any necessity for that. You had better take his memorial, and make the best terms you can with him yourself.\" M. Karkchulov assented, and received the docu ment from Prince Rodolph's hands. There was nothing more to detain him, and he proceeded towards the door. \" Oh, by-the-by,\" he exclaimed, turning back as he reached it, \"I don't think I told your Highness that this Simski appears to be a very religious man. It seems he was accustomed to hear Mass every morning, and at his request a priest has been visiting him in his prison. I suppose your orders as to the exclusion of visitors do not apply to the priest ? \" \" No, I suppose we can hardly forbid that,\" was the reply, and the Minister took his departure. Rodolph rose as he went out, and took a few turns up and down the apartment. p"], [78, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 66 \" I wonder what Lord Danvers has been doing all this time ! \" he murmured. Then he stopped and touched a bell. Immediately a small door at one side of the room was opened, and admitted Count Halstein. \"Halstein, how is it we have heard nothing of Lord Danvers and his English detective ? \" demanded the Prince. \" The very thing I was asking myself, sir,\" was the reply. \" I fear his lordship's zeal must have cooled by the time he got to London; or else he failed to find this Mr. Verriter so willing to come as he expected.\" But their doubts did injustice to both. Lord Danvers had not for one moment lost sight of the important mission entrusted to him, and the instant he had acquitted himself of his diplomatic com mission in a private interview with his Queen, he went off, without allowing the grass to grow under his feet, to seek Mr. Verriter at that gentleman's private address. Mr. Verriter was seated in the parlour of his pleasant suburban villa, situated on the banks of the famous river which flows through the gigantic metropolis of England, on one of the upper reaches, where it has not yet become contaminated by the smoke and refuse of a great city. The surround ings of Mr. Verriter's home were such as bespoke leisure and ease. A Virginia creeper trailed over the porch of the front door. A climbing rose hung its graceful festoons above the window opening on to the lawn behind. The lawn itself was a model of neatness. Beds of scarlet geraniums, of that circular shape dear to the heart of the horticulturist,"], [79, "EZEKIEL P. BAXTEE. 67 lit up the garden with their cheerful blaze of colour, and other flowers displayed their charms at each side of the lawn in those narrow borders without which no well-regulated garden can exist. At the bottom of the lawn, and before coming to the river, a plantation of gooseberry bushes, inter spersed with black and red currant trees, proved that if Mr. Verriter had a soul for beauty, he was not wholly insensible to pleasures of a less ethereal kind. As a matter of fact, his Duchesse pears were the objects of his dearest care, whilst his Orleans plums were celebrated for a space of ten miles up and down the river. But something had driven these agreeable topics from the detective's mind on this particular morning. He rose from his breakfast table with a dissatisfied ah1, and came and stood at the window, drumming impatiently with his fingers upon the pane. \" It is no use,\" he muttered to himself, \" I shall never be able to carry the matter further.\" And then passing slowly out into the garden he solilo quized thus \u2014 \" Let me see how the case stands.

He lives on the most affectionate terms with his family, and in fact, as far as his business and domestic relations are known, he seems to be a very happy and contented man. But on the night of Friday, the 4th of March, he leaves work at his usual hour, and from that moment he has never"], [80, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 68 been seen again by his family or his employers. No body resembling his has been found in any of the morgues or police stations. I am called in, after they have allowed three weeks for the scent to get thoroughly cold, and after a most searching investi gation, I succeed in finding that a man resembling the missing locksmith was in a public-house at the end of the street in which his business lay, on that very Friday night, in company with a foreigner. I find that they had a conversation, and apparently a dispute, in the course of which the barmaid thinks she heard repeated references to Petersburg. The foreigner was therefore in all probability a Russian. An examination of the shipping record shows that a Russian barque cleared out from the Thames only a few hours afterwards, bound for Petersburg. I have communicated with the Russian police, and they inform me that when this vessel reached Peters burg there was no Englishman on board of her, nor anything of a suspicious character ; and all their re searches have failed to throw any further light upon the mystery.\" Mr. Verriter paused in front of a white rose bush, and, scanning it carefully, thrust his finger and thumb between the branches, and drew forth a small snail which his keen eye had detected in this leafy refuge. He looked round cautiously for a moment, then approached the adjoining wall on tip-toe, and deftly jerked the snail over into the neighbouring garden, \u2014 a disreputable course of conduct which is too often sanctioned by the lax morality of suburban mankind. If Mr. Verriter had hoped that his unworthy"], [81, "EZEKIEL P. BAXTEE. 69 proceeding would be unobserved by any human eye he was deceived. As he turned round to resume his promenade he found himself face to face with a gentleman who was just about to address him. It was Lord Danvers. Mr. Verriter's countenance fell. The nobleman was well known to him, they having been associated in several of those diplomatic transactions which constituted Mr. Verriter's particular forte. \" Good morning, my lord,\" he said as the other approached. \" I wish I could think that your lordship was not here on business.\" The other smiled. \" Your anticipations are correct,\" he responded ; \"I have come to seek your assistance in what is probably the most important task ever yet entrusted to you.\" Mr. Verriter's countenance assumed an expression of humorous despair. The fact is, he was a traveller from necessity rather than from choice. Loving his native land to distraction, passionately attached to his house, his garden, and his flowers, Mr. Verriter grudged every moment spent away from them. So far as his own tastes were concerned, he detested foreign countries, and was never happy far away from his home, to which he returned with fresh ardour on the termination of each new expedition on the continent. However, the detective saw that his visitor had come on business of no ordinary character, and, quickly assuming a more serious air, he led him into the house. As soon as they were seated inside, Lord Danvers came at once to the point, and unfolded to the ears"], [82, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 70 of the detective as much as he himself knew of the events which had recently transpired in Balkistan. He wound up by saying \u2014 \" Now, Verriter, I am commissioned by Prince Rodolph to offer you your own terms to come to Sufarest without an hour of unnecessary delay, and get to the bottom of this business.\" Mr. Verriter had listened to the peer's recital without moving a muscle, except for an occasional slight contraction of his brow. At its close he sat for some little time without speaking. His eyes were half closed, and his manner had every appearance of listless indifference. \"Of course,\" he said, with a slight drawl, \"if the Russian police should find I was on their track, they would have me assassinated. But will your lordship honour me by trying one of these cigars ? \" Lord Danvers appeared to be disturbed by the cynical reflection of the detective. He accepted the proffered cigar, and observed as he lit it \u2014 \" I know you too well to believe that that remark means that you hesitate about accepting this task.\" The detective gave a careless nod as if he hardly thought it necessary to add an assurance on the subject. \"As to funds,\" said the other, \u2014 \"would you like me to give you a cheque on account, before you make your preparations to start?\" \"It is not worth while,\" rephed the detective, as he again half closed his eyes, and fell into a reposeful attitude, puffing lazily at a cigar, which he had lit at the same time as his visitor's. \"As to your journey,\" proceeded Lord Danvers, \" I have looked out the boats and trains, and I find"], [83, "EZEKIEL P. BAXTER. 71 that by leaving here in six hours' time you will be able to reach Sufarest on the Friday night.\" An imperceptible smile gleamed upon the lips of the detective. He made no reply, unless the gigantic cloud of smoke he ejected from his mouth the next instant could be considered in that light. The other next communicated the password which had been agreed upon, and proceeded to bestow further advice upon his listener, who sat with admirable patience till the nobleman had done. \"Well, then, I can rely on you!\" said Lord Danvers, rising at last to go. \" I will do my best,\" was the laconic reply of the detective, as he bowed out his visitor, still with the same air of calm indifference. The moment the front door closed, his whole manner changed. Rubbing his hands together, he passed rapidly back into the sitting-room, and then rushed upstairs and began hastily to toss over the contents of his voluminous wardrobe, a wardrobe containing dresses suitable for every character and every chmate, not to mention an assortment of beards and wigs which would have stocked a theatrical costumier's. Darting excitedly from bureau to bureau, and selecting the articles he required with wonderful rapidity, in less than an hour he had packed and removed downstairs half a dozen portmanteaus, the most remarkable point about which was the label affixed to each. Ringing the bell, Mr. Verriter gave instructions to his housekeeper to send for a conveyance, and then darted upstairs again, and spent the few minutes before its arrival to such good purpose that the visitor who had just left him would never have"], [84, "72 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. recognized his host in the lean-faced, lantern-jawed individual, with bushy eyebrows and thin straggling beard, arrayed in the most splendid frock coat which money could buy, who finally emerged from the house, took his seat in the cab along with his luggage, and gave the order to drive to an address in the city. Lord Danvers would have been still more surprised if he could have seen the detective, after stopping at one place to purchase a number of books dealing with Balkistan, and a couple of treatises on mineralogy, drive next to one of those obscure financial offices sometimes known as \" bucket shops,\" and invest several pounds in a large and varied assortment of shares in bubble companies, chiefly mines which had never produced any minerals, and whose reputation had long been below the reach of attack. But certainly none of those proceedings, however eccentric, would have caused him so much astonish ment as if he had been privileged to mount beside the luggage and read thereon, in a large flowing text, \u2014 \"Ezekiel P. Baxter, Chicago, U.S.A., passenger to St. Petersburg.\""], [85, "73 CHAPTER V CUI BONO ? It is a dark, rainy evening. The streets of Sufarest lie gloomy and deserted, and by contrast the various taverns are filled with light and the noise of drinking crowds. The Balkiards are a race disposed to con viviality, and the great temperance movement, which has done such wonders for our own happy country, has at present made but little headway in the region of Balkistan. Among others, the tavern dedicated to the Bal kiards' patron saint, Stefan, is doing a good business. Every now and then fresh comers arrive, singly or in small groups, and pass inside. They are to all appearance ordinary members of the working class. Only a very suspicious observer could have remarked anything in their walk or bearing that was not per fectly innocent and peaceful. Inside the tavern, where the customers sat in twos and threes round little wooden tables, and had their refreshments brought to them from time to time, there was nothing to attract the particular attention of a stranger who might have been present. The waiters came to receive their orders, disappeared, and returned, after more or less delay, bearing the comfortable fluids. To all appearance, the tavern"], [86, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 74 and its visitors lent themselves to participation in no darker offence than that of intoxication. If there were any exception to the happy spirit which seemed to prevail, it was at a table in a corner near the door, where a dark-visaged man with coal black hair was engaged in a stirring conversation with a group of dull-looking Balkiards, who ex changed glances between themselves at times, as if they understood each other, but were less familiar with their fellow-toper. The dark man was speaking in a mixture of good Russian and very imperfect Balkiard, while his companions answered him occa sionally in their own language, but sometimes in Russian nearly as good as his own. This person, whose manner seemed to grow more excited as the evening went on, at last began to raise his voice in such a manner as to be heard at other tables surrounding his own. His conversation ap peared to turn on the power and greatness of Russia, and by contrast the insignificance and weakness of Balkistan. Apparently he was too much excited with the strong liquors he had consumed to notice the annoyance aroused among the other inmates of the place by his boastful talk. He went on getting louder and more pointed in his allusions, till at length a waiter came up to him and tapped him on the shoulder \u2014 \" Look here, friend, if you can't keep a quieter tongue in your head you must go out of this.\" The black-haired man turned round with a half suppressed oath ; but made no other reply. He sat for some minutes after that without taking further part in tho conversation, seeming as if he were trying to overcome his intoxication."], [87, "CUI BONO? 75 Suddenly he sprang to his feet, and shouted in a loud voice \u2014 \" Long live the Czar ! \" And at once, without waiting to be ejected, he staggered to the door of the tavern. Flinging it open with a rough push of his fist, he swung out, exclaiming defiantly as he did so \u2014 \" Long live the Czar, and long live Simski ! \" Had the street outside been as empty as it had been only five minutes before, he would have been unheard. But it so happened that a police patrol was just in the act of passing by ; in fact, the drunken man, if he had listened, might easily have heard the sound of their footsteps outside. As it was, he fell an almost unresisting victim to the officers of justice, who carried him straight to the central police bureau of the capital. The superintendent on duty there was at first dis posed to send him straight to the cells, postponing his examination to the morning. But from this pur pose he was diverted by the prisoner's own conduct, who blurted out, with that air of friendly confidence which is common at one stage of intoxication \u2014 \" It's all right, old gentleman. I know Simski. He's a good man. I'll tell you all about him.\" The superintendent understood the Russian lan guage, in which the prisoner spoke, and asked him eagerly \u2014 \" What is it that you know ? \" \"Everything, everything. But I'm not going to tell you,\" muttered the prisoner, putting on an expression of drunken shyness. \" Oh yes, you will. Come on ; you said you were going to, just now.\""], [88, "76 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. Thus the superintendent, trying to soothe his prisoner, out of whom he had now conceived the hope of extracting some valuable information. The other drew himself up with an air of mock dignity. \" I have important disclosures to make,\" he said. \" I demand an interview with Prince Rodolph.\" The superintendent knitted his brows. His ex perience of gentlemen in this peculiar condition warned him that if this one were pressed he would probably turn sullen and refuse to say anything. On the other hand, if they did not get him to open his lips to-night, the morning would bring soberness and probably secrecy. A bright thought struck him. \" Sit down,\" he said to the prisoner. \" I will go and fetch his Highness.\" The prisoner sat, or rather fell, upon the seat offered to him, and the superintendent passed out of the room where this colloquy had taken place, by a private door. In a few minutes he emerged, accompanied by one of his subordinates, who had hastily assumed a costume of some splendour. The latter addressed the prisoner \u2014 \" Well, my friend, what have you to tell me ? Don't be afraid ; you are quite safe.\" The dark man muttered a few syllables, with a stupid stare at the sham prince. The detective shook his head, and whispered to his chief \u2014 \"He is talking German, I'm afraid. You will have to send for the Prince's private secretary, Count Halstein.\" The man noticed the whisper, and exclaimed\u2014"], [89, "CUI BONO? 77 \" Be off, sir ! Retire ! You are not Prince Rodolph. I will inform his Highness of this decep tion.\" \"Perhaps he had better be taken to the Palace. It will save time, in case his Highness is willing to see him,\" said the superintendent aside to his officer. The latter nodded, and went out to procure a vehicle. It was soon ready, and the prisoner was taken out and pushed into it, repeating his demand to be confronted instantly with the Prince of Bal kistan. They drove quickly to the Palace, the superin tendent thinking it worth his while to accompany his prisoner, and were admitted to the same apart ment in which Simski himself had been interrogated on the evening of his attempt. A message was taken in to the Prince, who sent out Count Halstein to inquire into the circumstances. As soon as the Count entered the apartment the man rose, and seemed about to salute him. The superintendent of police hastily explained the inci dents which had led to his arrest and being brought thither, adding, that he thought the man was anxious to make some statement, and appeared to wish to do so in the German tongue. Count Halstein thereupon turned to the prisoner, and said to him in that language \u2014 \"If you have anything to say, I am prepared to hear it.\" \" Cui bono,\" was the growled-out response. The Count could not suppress a start of surprise. \"Ha!\" exclaimed the delighted superintendent, \"I told you he spoke it, sir.\""], [90, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 78 Halstein gave a smile ; and then betaking himself to the English language, he asked \u2014 \" You have just pronounced a password. From whom did you learn it ? \" \"From Lord Danvers,\" replied Mr. Verriter, whose disguise had now served its purpose. \" I regret I have not been able to approach you under better auspices, but the fact is that I have made one attempt to reach the Prince already, and it failed, owing to the exclusive character which he maintains.\" \" Well, but what can we do now ? How are we to deal Avith these people ? \" said Halstein, who saw the police watching the colloquy with all their eyes. \" Tell this man that I appear to you to be drunk, but perfectly harmless, and that as I am a native of Germany you will be responsible for me.\" The Count made the suggested communication in Balkiard, and the superintendent withdrew with his satellites, secretly vexed at the disappointment to his curiosity in this tame ending of what had promised to be a sensational affair. As soon as they were alone, the Count turned eagerly to the detective, the last sign of whose intoxication had disappeared like magic as the door closed behind the departing police. \" Come upstairs with me, Mr. Verriter. It will be safer for you not to be seen going into the Prince's cabinet, so I will take you to my own apartments, and the Prince can join us there.\" Mr. Verriter acquiesced with a nod, and Halstein led the way to the place proposed. Here he left him for a few moments, while he went to acquaint his master that the detective had arrived. Rodolph hailed the news with joy, and in a short"], [91, "CUI BONO? 79 time the three were closeted together in confidential intercourse. \" You have committed one unfortunate error,\" were the detective's first words, after a courteous and even hearty greeting had passed between the Prince and himself. \" You have allowed a priest to go con stantly to see that scoundrel since he has been under arrest.\" The faces of the others showed their astonishment. \"Yes,\" he went on. \"Has your Highness for gotten that the Czar of Russia is the head of the Church to which the Balkiards belong, and that the Bishop of Sufarest almost openly patronized the wretches who carried off Prince Iskander ? \" \" I see your point,\" returned Rodolph. \" You think that this priest may be an agent of the enemy.\" \" I know that he daily carries messages of en couragement to him from the heads of the Russian faction,\" was the decisive answer. Prince Rodolph winced. \" I gave the permission without thinking,\" he said ; \"but I will give fresh orders to-morrow. I see you have not been wasting your time, sir, though I began to fear something was wrong when I did not hear from you for so long.\" \" I am afraid your Highness is partly responsible for that,\" rephed the detective with a smile. \"Had you read a certain memorial through, instead of handing it over to your Ministers, you might have found a Latin phrase introduced which would have put you on the alert.\" \"Ah!\" Rodolph struck his head with his hand. \" Is it possible that you are Ezekiel P. Baxter ? \""], [92, "80 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. \" At your Highness's service.\" \"I can hardly forgive myself. I did read the memorial, and the words ' cui bono ' actually caught my attention ; and I remember remarking on the coincidence. But I confess it never occurred to me that your disguise would assume so elaborate a form. Tell me all about it, and what you have been doing.\" Mr. Verriter gave a gratified smile. \"Before I do that, I should like, if I am not pre suming, to ask if your Highness has any fresh in formation to give me, beyond that conveyed by Lord Danvers.\" \" I am quite willing to give you what there is, but it is not much. The police have done their best, and presented a very voluminous report, but it does not carry us much farther.\" The Englishman made a gesture of contempt. \"I think I know all about that, your Highness,\" he said. And giving way to the natural preference which a clever man is apt to feel for telling a story himself instead of listening to another, he went on rapidly, almost taking the words out of the Prince's mouth \u2014 \" They did all the things that Simski told them to do ; searched his house for the proofs of his innocence, and of course found them ; inquired at the places where he had told them to inquire, and in short found out everything which he wished them to find out \u2014 and nothing more.\" \" You seem to have seen the report,\" remarked Rodolph. \" No, your Highness, I have not seen it, but I have heard a good deal, and I can pretty well guess its contents. I know what such documents are : an"], [93, "CUI BONO? 81 inventory of his furniture, severe cross-examination of his landlord, faithful histories of all the poor devils who had the misfortune to lodge in the same house with him, though they probably never spoke to him once in their lives. With the exception of reports of parliamentary debates, I know of nothing which con tains so httle valuable matter in proportion to its space as the average police report.\" Rodolph smiled at this vehemence. \" There are only two facts of importance in all this mass of rubbish,\" pursued the other. \"First, that the creature is a Russian, and second, that the Russian pohce want him to get off.\" \" Then you accept his Highness's view that this is a political plot ? \" put in Count Halstein. The detective turned on him in amazement. \" It is as clear as the sun in heaven ! If that were all I wanted to know, I need never have left England. The only question, I take it, is how to obtain evidence \u2014 evidence of such a convincing kind as will justify his Highness in acting upon it.\" \" You have seized the situation exactly,\" observed Rodolph. \" But you are forgetting your story. Let us hear it from the beginning.\" Mr. Verriter bowed, settled himself comfortably in his seat, and commenced \u2014 \" As soon as Lord Danvers had told me what was the task before me, I saw at once that there was quite as much diplomatic as detective work involved. The most important thing in the first place, therefore, was to come here in a character that would arouse no suspicion, and enable me to mix if necessary in the highest class of society. I concluded that an American capitalist, coming to look out for a good G"], [94, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 82 speculation, would be the most plausible disguise I could assume, and would leave me plenty of liberty. Accordingly I became Mr. Baxter, interested in mining, and read up enough mineralogy on the journey to Petersburg to rub along with.\" \" To Petersburg ! Have you \u2014 but I remember, M. Karkchulov told me you had come from there.\" \"Just so. Your Highness sees the importance of my going there first. If M. Karkchulov has made a note of my having come from there, you may be sure that M. Schoffzan and his friends have done the same. It was of vital importance to win the confidence of the Russian agents here, and I thought the best way to do it was to arrive from the capital of Russia, with Russian labels on my luggage, and a passport issued by the American Legation and viseed by the Russian authorities.\" \" You might almost have come as a Russian your self,\" suggested Count Halstein. \" No. Impossible. I should have had to provide myself with Russian parents, and a whole life history, which the police would have examined into and torn to shreds directly. No, even the Russian police can not pretend to keep a record of all the speculators in America. As Ezekiel P. Baxter I provoke no suspicion, and I can defy any scrutiny.\" \"You are right.\" \" As I had to pass through Petersburg, I took the opportunity to make a few inquiries about another matter. It so happened that, at the very time I received your Highness's commands from Lord Danvers, I was engaged in another investigation which brought me into contact with the Russian police, and led me to suspect their good faith. An"], [95, "CUI BONO? 83 Englishman, a working locksmith, had disappeared mysteriously some time ago, and I believed I had traced him on board a Russian barque bound for Petersburg. Their pohce had denied that any such person had arrived there, and of course it seemed impossible to disbelieve them. But after being brought into this case, I began to feel very uneasy about poor Berne, the locksmith, and to wonder if it were possible that the Russians had stooped to make him the victim of one of then- rascally intrigues. As soon as I got to Petersburg I went to the English ambassador's, revealed that I was a detective, and ascertained that the safe of the embassy was manu factured by the same firm which employed this poor fellow. At my request the ambassador rearranged the papers in the safe, and so disposed them that he could not fail to know if they were disturbed by any strange hand. We then locked the safe, and for greater security I carried off the only key myself. The next day I returned, and we opened the safe together. The papers had all been moved ! \" \"And you think ?\" cried Rodolph, breath lessly. \" I conclude that Berne was carried off by force, and compelled to make a duplicate key, and to explain the mechanism of the lock, which is peculiar in other ways. And at this moment I should not wonder if he were in a Russian prison.\" Rodolph shuddered. \" How long \u2014 \" he exclaimed fiercely \u2014 \"how long are such things to go on? \u2014 and the whole of Europe standing by, afraid even to protest ! \" \"You forget,\" said the other, \"all Europe does not know of these things. If I were to go back to"], [96, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 84 London to-morrow, and announce my discoveries, what would happen? I could prove nothing; the public has no imagination ; I should be disbelieved and laughed at. No, but I hope to got something to go upon in connection with tho crime of which your Highness was the objoct, and if I succeed, then, perhaps, something may come of it. It is a duel between the Russian police and me \u2014 lot us see which gets the better of it.\" He pronounced these words with a quiet confidence which inspired Prince Rodolph with fresh hopo. Then he returned to his story \u2014 \"I made good use of my time while I was in Petersburg, apart from that other affair. 1 acquired a good deal of information about the Russophile movement in this country, and its hopes of success. I was even fortunate enough to obtain a letter of introduction to M. Nelidoff himself, the Consul-General here, from a quarter which could arouse no suspicion in his mind.\" \" I remember M. Karkchulov said you were staying at the St. Stefan Hotel, the favourite haunt of tho conspirators. It rather set me against you, and made me refuse to give you the interview you asked for.\" Verriter rubbed his hands with delight. \"Capital! The very effect which I wished to produce ! \" he exclaimed. \" I need not say that the less notice your Highness takes of me in public the better it will be for our success. I have oven come here to-night to propose that you should order me to be arrested.\" \" But I have just caused the police to liberate you, on the ground that you wore harmless,\" objected Halstein."], [97, "CUI BONO? 85 \" You have made them liberate the drunkard from the tavern,\" replied the detective. \"But that is no reason why they should not arrest Mr. Ezekiel P. Baxter, the American financier.\" \" But why ? and on what grounds ? \" It was the Prince who asked this question. \"I am coming to that, your Highness. Let me first relate how I was received by M. Nelidoff. I had formed the plan of seeking a mining concession, because I thought that would furnish an excuse for your receiving me at the palace when it became necessary. It has also enabled me to make various inquiries into the state of the country, which have not been barren of result. To begin with, I opened out my schemes to M. Nelidoff. I thought it would be a little too barefaced to pretend to be a sympa thizer with Russia on political grounds ; as your Highness knows, capitalists have no conscience but a financial one, and no country except that where their money is invested. I explained to the Consul that, before sinking any large amount in Balkistan, I desired to have some assurance as to the settled condition of the country. I told him that I had no confidence in the stability of the present Government, but that information received in Petersburg had led me to hope that before very long the country might pass under the control of the Czar, in which case I should feel that my capital might be invested with safety.\" Prince Rodolph smiled, perhaps a httle uneasily, at this cynical explanation. No monarch likes to be told that his throne is considered insecure, however strongly he may suspect the fact himself. \" If I had professed any good motive for"], [98, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 86 sympathizing with them, the wretches would have dis trusted me, but this parade of selfishness won their confidence at once. Result, \u2014 I am as friendly as possible with the whole traitorous gang. I see Schoffzan and Nelidoff constantly, and his Grace the Metropolitan is actually going to take a share in my explorations after antimony.\" \" Stefan ! I guessed as much ! \" The English detective gazed curiously at Prince Rodolph. \" Should I be taking a liberty if I were to ask your Highness to explain your remark with reference to the Bishop?\" \" Not at all.\" And the Prince proceeded to describe Monsignor Stefan's agitation in the carriage at the moment of the attempted assassination, his subse quent inquiries at the banquet into Simski's fate, and the rather hollow pretence by which he had sought to cover his curiosity. \"And yet your Highness has allowed him to send a priest there every day!\" observed the detective reproachfully. \"But to go on with my story. I made the best use I could of our intimacy, and I soon gathered some important evidence. In the first place, of course, they all professed great horror at Simski's outrage\u2014 almost overdid it, in fact. But then they all took the view that the fellow was not responsible for his actions, and ought not to be punished. That is a pretty sure sign of sympathy, if not of actual complicity. In the second place, I soon gathered that there was something in the air of a serious character, and by degrees I began to suspect that there had been a concerted plot for a rising, of which Simski's pistol-shot was to have been the"], [99, "CUI BONO? 87 signal. And, what is more, they have not abandoned the idea. An active conspiracy is on foot at this moment, and energetic attempts are being made to corrupt the troops.\" \" How did you find that out ? \" demanded the Prince, breathlessly. \" I will tell your Highness. Every evening Messieurs Nelidoff and Schoffzan and their friends spend some time in the cafe on the ground floor of the hotel. I took to going there with them, and I quickly noticed that from time to time notes were secretly handed by them to the waiters of the place, when they came to receive orders. These notes were carried off, and when the waiter who had taken one came back with the brandy or wine, or whatever it was, he very often brought another note, which he slipped into the hand of his patron as secretly as he had taken the first. I must not claim much credit for my discovery, for, to tell the truth, impunity has given them confidence, and they did not conceal their little man\u0153uvres very skilfully. Well, it did not take me long to discover that there was a tavern at the back of the hotel, for the lower classes, to which the waiters could easily gain access by means of a passage running between the bars. I therefore put on the clothes you see me in, and spent an evening among the company gathered at the back, when I quickly saw what became of the letters, and where the replies came from.\" \" Ah ! And my pohce have never even suspected this correspondence ! \" was the bitter comment of the Prince. \"Oh, your Highness must not blame them for that. It is not work to which they are accustomed."], [100, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 88 And it is really not badly managed, for barbarians. For instance, a fellow sitting at a table with three or four others calls for a cup of coffee. It is brought to him ; he waits till the coffee is cool, and then, as he lifts the cup, quietly passes his fingers over the saucer. The note has been lying between the two.\" \"And have you obtained a sight of any of these missives?\" \"I have. It was the only thing that presented any difficulty, as I knew the waiters must be all in the plot, and it would be rather dangerous to try and bribe them. At one time I thought of applying for a situation for myself, but the proprietor would not have taken any but a Russian. However, I managed it at last, and it cost me remarkably little. I pre tended that my motive was curiosity, and the bribe consisted of a thousand dollars' worth of shares in the antimony mine.\" Verriter said this with a sly smile, to which his listeners responded. \"I did not dare to ask to see too many at first, but, of course, the man is now in my power, and I can, if necessary, force him to show me others. I read letters from Schoffzan himself to officers in the army, promising them high promotion from the Czar, and replies, in which questions were asked as to the date of the rising. There were other letters explaining why it had been put off, and clearly referring to the assassin. I became fully convinced in my own mind that Nelidoff, Schoffzan, and the Bishop were all fully privy to his attempt.\" The Prince said nothing, but he turned and darted a look at his secretary which the three gentlemen just named would not have liked to see."], [101, "CUI BONO? 89 \" I think I ought to warn your Highness about one garrison. I have seen a note from the commandant at Sagratz, in which he claims to have won over every man under his command.\" \" Sagratz ? Where have I heard that name ? \" muttered the Prince. \" I think I can tell your Highness. It was in Mr. Baxter's memorial. I fixed on that locality for my mine.\" \"To be sure. But this information is most im portant. If you found out nothing more your coming here would have been valuable indeed, Mr. Verriter.\" The Englishman bowed low. Then he quickly passed on. \" So far as this treasonable correspondence is concerned, it would be amply sufficient to put all the traitors in Balkistan in our power. But your High ness wants something more than that. We must have documents incriminating the Government of Russia, if possible the Czar himself.\" \" And how do you hope to get at them ? \" \" That is what I have been considering, and I see only one method. If any such papers exist, they must be in the residences of M. Schoffzan and the Bishop. To search them effectually it will be neces sary to proceed boldly. Your Highness must issue orders to-morrow to have both gentlemen placed under arrest, and while they are in prison I will undertake to find whatever there is to be found.\" The Prince started at this daring suggestion. While he was hesitating, Count Halstein put in a word \u2014 \" Did you not say just now that you wished to be arrested yourself? \""], [102, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 90 \"Exactly. You must have me arrested at the same time, as if you suspected me of being a con federate of the others. The result will be to establish my character with them, and when we are all three released, they will receive me with open arms.\" The Prince could not forbear nodding his approval at the sagacity of this reasoning. \"But how will you manage the search in the mean time ? \" persisted the secretary, whose mind did not travel quite so quickly as his master's. \"That is very simple.\" And the detective pro ceeded to unfold a plan which won the ready assent of his listeners. Half an hour afterwards he had quitted the palace."], [103, "91 CHAPTER VI. THE BISHOP OF StJFAKEST. The following day Mr. Ezekiel P. Baxter breakfasted early, and shortly before eleven o'clock ordered a carriage, and told the driver to take him to the episcopal palace. This building, situated in the finest quarter of Sufarest, was little inferior in size and appearance to the residence of the Prince of Balkistan himself. It was surrounded by a large courtyard, enclosed with a massive iron railing, almost strong enough to stand a siege. On the present occasion, however, the great gates stood wide open, and Mr. Baxter's carriage was admitted without a challenge. He alighted at the foot of the imposing flight of steps which led up to the main entrance. Evidently he was expected, for the announcement of his name was received with much respect by the servants in attendance, and he was ushered into the Bishop's presence forthwith. The Metropolitan of Balkistan was in conversation with another visitor before the arrival of the American capitalist. This gentleman, for such the usage of the great world obliges us to term him, was no other than the constitutional leader of the friends of Russia in Balkistan, Dietrich Schoffzan. How far the"], [104, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 92 suspicions entertained of him were justified may, perhaps, be gathered from a few sentences of his conversation with Monsignor Stefan. \"No news, they say, is good news,\" he was remarking, \"yet I must confess that Tataroff's silence makes me uneasy. Of course, it was very annoying that things should have gone wrong as they did, just at the last moment, but after all we are no worse off than we were before. And not a breath of suspicion has fallen upon us or our party.\" \"Perhaps not, openly,\" replied Stefan, on whose face there rested an anxious frown, \" but we cannot tell what the German is thinking secretly.\" This was an allusion to Prince Rodolph. It was the custom among his enemies to harp on the fact of his being a foreigner in race, in contradistinction to the Czar, who was supposed to have sprung from the same stock as the Balkiard nation. \" Only God reads the heart,\" added Stefan, with a pious levity in which Churchmen of his school find a certain consolation for the hypocrisy they are obliged to practise in public. His companion gazed at him gloomily, without making any response. The prelate resumed : \u2014 \"The fact is, the whole affair was a wretched bungle, and I was nearer committing myself than I have ever been before in my life. No wonder the Czar is angry with us. We have tapped the limpet, we have put the enemy on his guard for the future.\" \"But surely you don't mean to say that you have any real fear ? It is impossible that anything can be discovered ? \" \"Nothing is impossible in this life,\" returned the prelate, with another touch of professional irony."], [105, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAEEST. 93 \" If anything were to come out that implicated us, it would be useless to expect the Czar to do much at present. I am afraid that it would be terribly awk ward for you, my poor friend.\" Schoffzan gave a faint shudder, as certain un pleasant consequences presented themselves to his mind. \"I wish I had some document,\" he said, half to himself, \"which would enable me to make sure of the Czar's protection. It is horribly dangerous to go on hke this, incurring so much risk, without anything but the promises of an agent like Tataroff to rely on.\" The Churchman smiled with a slight tincture of disdain. \" True, my dear Schoffzan ; but, then, think of your reward ! Governor of Balkistan for life, or, if you prefer it, General in the Russian army. Surely that is a high ambition for one who \u2014 excuse my know ledge of these details \u2014 was born in a station that society does not consider as illustrious.\" The deputy glanced suspiciously at his confederate, and retorted \u2014 \"And what of yourself, Bishop? What can you have in view that will be higher than your present station ? Has Tataroff promised you the primacy of all the Russias ? \" The other smiled, and shook his head in a depre cating manner. \" Hush, sh- ; you forget you are speaking to a priest. It is sufficient encouragement for me if I am strengthening the position of our holy religion, and combating a heretic. Any personal rewards which I may be deemed worthy of will doubtless be bestowed at the right time by our beloved Czar.\""], [106, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 94 M. Schoffzan bit his lips, and frowned. He had a dim suspicion that the Metropolitan had done better for himself than he, Schoffzan, had, and that his security for the future was not entirely confined to pious hopes. But he saw that it was useless to pursue the subject. \" I am expecting the American here every minute,\" observed Monsignor Stefan, after a pause. \" Ah ! Is the object of his visit a secret ? \" \" Oh dear, no ! He merely comes here to negotiate for a lease of some Church lands in the neighbour hood of Sagratz. It seems he is expecting to get a concession for antimony mines in that district.\" \"So he told me. Of course you know that he came here from Petersburg ? \" The two conspirators exchanged looks full of meaning. \" Yes. I see that the circumstance has struck you in the same light as it has me.\" \" I wish I could understand a little more about him. It is at least singular that he should arrive so soon after Simsk \" The prelate frowned, and held up a warning finger. \" I beg your pardon. So soon after the failure of the anticipated rebellion,\" said Schoffzan, correcting himself in deference to the prejudices of the other. Inly, he rather despised the Metropolitan for his affectation. \" I agree with you, Schoffzan. It would be a disagreeable thing to think we had lost the confidence of the Czar. You and I know that the failure was due to no fault of ours, but the authorities at Petersburg are suspicious, and they naturally look at results.\""], [107, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAREST. 95 \" If this man had come from England, now, I could have understood it,\" said the politician. \"I know on the best authority that Lord Danvers was closeted with the Prince for hours on the night of the arrest.\" \" As far as that is concerned, we ought to be able to trust M. Tataroff. He is not the man to let a person like this M. Baxter pass through Petersburg without finding out something about him.\" The Bishop spoke a little doubtfully. Before either of the speakers could say anything more the con ference was interrupted by the arrival of the personage under discussion. He came in quietly, and gave a respectful greeting to Monsignor Stefan, and a more familiar one to M. Schoffzan. \" I think I have come at the hour named by your Grace ? \" he began, glancing at the deputy. \"Yes. M. Schoffzan has just been telling me something about your plans. He says you are con fident that there are rich deposits in the mountains.\" \" So sure am I of finding them that I have come all the way from Chicago to put my idea into effect. My information is drawn partly from conversations with a Balkiard whom I met in the silver fields of Nevada, and partly from the accounts I have read of the geological formation of the Balkistan range.\" The speaker was of course ignorant of the sus picions regarding his character which had been hinted at just before his entrance. To his listeners, how ever, this answer seemed deliberately designed to meet them. \"I understand,\" said Stefan. \"And you propose to commence operations in a part of the district"], [108, "96 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. which is included in the estates held by the see of Sufarest ? \" \" That is it. And before setting to work I should like to come to an understanding with your Grace as to a lease of such portions of the land as I decide to prospect over. Of course I cannot afford to sink a large amount of capital without obtaining security against losing the fruits of my labour.\" \" That is natural enough. Well, I don't suppose we shall have any difficulty about terms. Have you brought a draft of the lease with you ? \" The reply of the financier was to produce a long and intricate document which the Bishop took and began to study. While he was doing so, Mr. Baxter turned to the politician, and said \u2014 \" I hear a queer thing happened last night. A drunken fellow was arrested outside the St. Stefan tavern for calling out \u2014 ' Long live Simski ! ' and \u2014 ' Down with Rodolph ! '\" \" I know it,\" replied Schoffzan, falling at once into the trap. \" He didn't say ' Down with Rodolph ! ' though, but 'Long live the Czar! ' It appears they took him to the palace, where he talked German to Count Halstein, the Prince's private secretary, you know, who takes no part in politics. Halstein took him to his own apartments, and told the police that he was a fellow-countryman, and quite harmless.\" \" H'm ! Does anybody know anything about him ? \" \" No, he is quite a stranger. At all events, he is not a member of our party, so no great harm can be done.\" Monsignor Stefan laid down the lease he was"], [109, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAREST. 97 perusing, and directed a searching glance at the foreigner. \" I think you came from Petersburg, did you not ? \" he inquired. \" Yes. You see, I am supposed to be half a Russian myself; my father's mother came from Russia, and I thought I should like to have a look at the country. Besides\" \u2014 here he sank his voice, and looked round the room as if to make sure of not being overheard \u2014 \" I wanted to find out what prospect there was of the German keeping possession of the government. I need hardly tell your Grace that if I thought he was likely to stay here long it would make a great difference in my plans. Indeed, I don't know that I should feel very safe in taking a lease of Church lands with a man on the throne who might con fiscate them at any moment.\" \"Well? \" The Bishop spoke calmly, but his face betrayed a little anxiety at Mr. Baxter's closing remarks. \"Well, I found that my fears were groundless. I was informed on reliable authority that the Govern ment was determined to annex Balkistan, and that no stone would be left unturned to get rid of the intruder.\" He pronounced these words with significant em phasis ; and again the Bishop gave him a searching look. His impression was confirmed that this foreigner was a spy, but he still laboured under some doubt as to whether he was dealing with a spy of Tataroff's or of Prince Rodolph's. There were strong reasons for leaning to the former supposition; but, as he had been feeling for several days, it was of the last h"], [110, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 98 importance that some decisive test should be applied to settle the question. However, he did not see his way to do anything of the kind just then, so he con tented himself with asking Mr. Baxter to leave the agreement with him for further examination, and thereby signifying that the interview was at an end. The American assented to this request, and with drew to the carriage which was waiting for him. As he passed through the hall, a clock struck the hour of noon. He smiled, and passed hastily down the steps. As Mr. Baxter made towards his carriage, he ob served a personage approaching with whom he was on friendly terms. This was M. Nelidoff, the repre sentative of Russia, to whom he had brought an introduction on his arrival in Sufarest. He had met him frequently since, in the cafe frequented by the Czar's partisans, but had not made quite so much progress in his confidence as he had in M. Schoff zan's. The fact was, that the Russian Consul had as yet received no orders from head- quarters about the new arrival, and was in consequence on his guard. However, they both bowed cordially enough on the present occasion. Then, as the American drove slowly away, M. Nelidoff ascended the steps of the episcopal palace, and inquired for the Bishop. He was received with the greatest deference, and immediately ushered upstairs into the room which Mr. Baxter had just quitted. \" So that American adventurer has been with you?\" were the Consul's first words, after the ordinary greetings had been exchanged. \" Yes,\" replied the Bishop, cautiously ; \"he came"], [111, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAREST. 99 about a lease which he wants to take of some lands belonging to my diocese, and on which, as he says, he expects to find deposits of antimony.\" \"And did he say nothing to you except about his mining speculations ? \" \"Well, yes; he talked about Petersburg, and seemed very anxious for Russia to take over the govern ment of the country,\" was the answer, in indifferent tones. M. Nelidoff fixed his eyes alternately on the prelate and on M. Schoffzan. Each of those worthies in turn scanned the other's face, and that of the Consul- General, but for some moments not one of the three broke silence. It is the misfortune of those who carry on secret intrigues that they never know how far to trust their own comrades. There are police spies among the revolutionary societies ; there are secret revolutionists in the ranks of the police. Again, there are members of the police who have received orders to pretend to sell themselves to the foes of society, but who, in carrying out their instructions, incur the suspicion of their first employers ; and there are friends of revo lution who accept the pay of its enemies in order to lead them off the scent, but who gradually cease to retain the confidence of their original comrades. So bewildering is the maze thus created, that in the underground political world of to-day there are quite a number of persons whose real views are not known at all ; who, by rendering services first to one and then to the other, succeed in deceiving both sides, and who are ready to claim the rewards of whichever party shall be ultimately successful. The feelings of doubt and distrust generated by"], [112, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 100 this state of things were present in full force in the political atmosphere of Balkistan ; and not one of the three who were now met together in the Bishop's residence felt absolutely confident of his companions' fidelity. M. Nelidoff, who, as a native of Russia, had the most to gain by the success of Russian intrigue, and the least to hope for from any Balkiard sovereign, was the first to speak. \" Is this man sent here by Tataroff, or not ? \" The other two looked relieved. If they were being spied upon from head-quarters, it was at least a good thing to know that the Consul-General was in the same boat with them. The Balkiard politician hastened to reply \u2014 \" That is the very question we were considering before you came in. We can hardly believe that an American, whose natural route would bring him here by way of Austria, or by sea to Constantinople, would have gone all round by Petersburg without some good motive. On the other hand, what reason can Tataroff have for distrusting us ? And would not a spy of his be more likely to disparage the Czar, instead of always sounding his praises, as this fellow does?\" \"Oh, you needn't rely on that,\" said the Consul. \" Nothing that Tataroff does is like anything done by ordinary people. As for his distrusting us, that is hardly the way to put it. When Tataroff orders a thing to be carried out, he expects to have it done, and woe betide the man who fails him.\" \"But surely no blame can rest on us?\" objected Schoffzan, looking somewhat disturbed. \" That's as he may think,\" retorted the other."], [113, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAREST. 101 \" Did I tell you the way he treated our ambassador in England, not long ago ? \" \"No.\" \"Well, I will tell you just as I heard it. A messenger arrived at the embassy one night, saying he had come all the way from Petersburg to London without stopping, to bring a special order from Tataroff. The passwords and so on were all right, and he proceeded to give the message, which was to order his Excellency to have a skilful English lock- smith, in the employ of a certain firm of safe manu- facturers, secretly kidnapped and sent off to Russia. It appears he was wanted to make false keys for the safe of the Enghsh ambassador in Petersburg, a job which they hadn't any Russian workmen skilful enough to carry out. Now, his Excellency, as you may have heard, is a very timid man, and he was afraid to execute the order, because, although the English police are not very difficult to deceive, yet if you do get found out there, the law comes down on you, no matter who you are. So, what did the ambassador do but fall ill, and send for the prin- cipal English Court physician, whom he kept dancing attendance on him for a fortnight. Of course tele- grams were instantly sent off to Tataroff by his creatures in the embassy, hinting that this illness was a sham. Well, at the end of the fortnight, one day the poor man's bedroom door opened, at the hour when the English doctor usually came, and who should walk in but Tataroff himself! The poor ambassador nearly fainted at the sight, but he had presence of mind enough to speak in a low voice, like one in the last stage of sickness. No use: Tataroff walked up to the bedside, took out a little"], [114, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 102 packet, poured out some white powder into a wine glass, and said : ' Here is a prescription which I have brought with me from Russia. It contains aconite, and is a certain cure for illnesses like yours.' Well, his Excellency didn't wait to hear any more ; he jumped out of bed in an instant, and swore to obey orders better in future; and by this time, no doubt, the locksmith is in Petersburg, if he hasn't gone on to the Siberian mines.\" The two Balkiards listened with ill-concealed alarm to this illustration of the methods of the dreaded police agent who was known as Tataroff. At the close of the story Monsignor Stefan observed : \" They say that he does what he likes with the Czar.\" \"He is the Czar.'\" retorted Nelidoff, who seemed to enjoy the dismay he was producing in his hearers. \" The personage on the throne, the head of our holy religion,\" \u2014 here he crossed himself, so strong is the force of habit, \u2014 \" is like those Kings of France we read about, the only difference being that in Russia the mayor of the palace does not come forward in public. But it is well known that the Czar has no control over him, and hardly dares to disobey his advice. In fact, some people say it was Tataroff who killed his father.\" \" Good heavens ! \" exclaimed the two listeners together. \"What motive could he have for that ? \" demanded the Bishop. \" Oh, it is easy to see the motive. Iskander II. was turning Liberal ; he had refused to suppress cer tain newspapers and to have some prisoners executed whom Tataroff wanted out of the way. So they say"], [115, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAREST. 103 his death was arranged for. Of course,\" added the Russian, who seemed to see nothing surprising in what he was explaining, \" Tataroff wasn't seen in it. All he had to do was just to refrain from arresting the conspirators, when he learnt from his agents that a plot was going forward. Then of course the Nihilists did the rest. What was also a point gained for the police was that, owing to the success of this con spiracy, every one associated with it is trusted by the Nihilists, including the traitor who denounced it to Tataroff, and he is thus enabled to make great use of him. Yes, he is a clever man, that Tataroff.\" \" But what do you think he has in view in sending this Mr. Baxter here ? \" inquired the Metropolitan, who began to see depths in Russian intrigue which he had not before suspected. Before M. Nelidoff could answer this question, the conversation was interrupted by a loud noise in the street below. Groans, hootings, and other signs of popular indignation resounded on all sides. The three allies rushed to the windows of the apartment, which commanded the principal thoroughfare of Sufarest. The sight they beheld was a striking con firmation of their suspicions as to the pretended American speculator. There in his carriage sat Mr. Baxter, guarded by three members of the police, and accompanied by an armed escort, evidently on his way to the State prison. It was this spectacle which had called forth the unpleasant enthusiasm of the mob. Scarcely had the Bishop and his visitors exchanged remarks on this proof that the stranger was a Russian emissary, when a loud knock at the door of the room drew their startled attention. Instantly the door was"], [116, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 104 opened from outside, and the Chief of the Balkiard Police entered, clad in the splendid insignia of his office. A number of his men were visible in the corridor behind. \" What is the meaning of this invasion of my palace ? \" angrily demanded the Bishop. \"I regret it, your Grace,\" replied the officer with respectful firmness, \"but I have to inform you that your Grace is under arrest on a charge of treasonable correspondence with foreign powers. M. Schoffzan, you are my prisoner also. M. Nelidoff, I have orders to clear this palace without delay, and I must request you to leave at once.\" The two prisoners trembled violently at the first shock of these alarming tidings. The Consul drew himself up, and replied with the confidence which he derived from his diplomatic position \u2014 \"Before I go, sir, I have to demand an explanation of this arrest of a bishop of the holy Church of which the Czar, my master, is the head. As you are no doubt aware, by certain treaties which have never been abrogated, the Czar of Russia is con stituted protector of all the members of our holy religion who are subjects of the Sultan of Turkey. Balkistan is still, for international purposes, a pro vince of the Turkish empire, and I therefore insist on my right to protect theMetropolitan Bishop of Sufarest. In the name of the Czar of Russia, I forbid this arrest.\" The Chief of Police, who had listened with admir able patience to this address, shook his head at its close. \" I have to carry out my orders,\" he replied. \" It is no use saying all this to me. You must go to the Ministers, and make your protest to them.\""], [117, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAEEST. 105 \" And meanwhile I am to be dragged off to a prison ! \" exclaimed the prelate with fury. \" No, it's not so bad as that, your Grace. My orders are to escort you to the monastery of St. George, and upon receiving your parole not to attempt an escape, you will be left there unmolested for the present.\" The ecclesiastic pondered for a moment, and then said \u2014 \" Well, sir, I know you are merely the instrument of others, so I submit under protest. I must go into my oratory to recite a prayer, and then I shall be ready to come with you.\" And he turned to pass through an inner door. But the Chief of Police had evidently received special instructions which prepared him for some such request. He stepped forward in front of the Bishop. \" Pardon me, your Grace, but I have the strictest orders not to allow you out of my sight for a moment, on any pretext, until you are within the gates of St. George's.\" \" Sir, this is infamous ! \" cried the churchman. \" I must, I will, perform my religious devotions.\" (\" The Czar shall hear of this ! \" exclaimed the Consul-General, anxious to assist his friend.) \" Then it must be in my presence,\" said the officer to his prisoner. The latter almost gnashed his teeth at this reply. A moment's reflection, however, convinced his wary mind that to make too much of the point might excite suspicion. In fact, it had already occurred to the distrustful mind of Schoffzan that his fellow conspirator must be in possession of some documents"], [118, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 106 which he was anxious to take with him ; and the deputy began to congratulate himself on the absence in his own case of the very pledges which he had been wishing for within the past hour. So rapidly does evil become good, and good evil, in human affairs. With a view of averting suspicion from his motives, Stefan now knelt down upon the floor of the room where the arrest had taken place, the others piously following his example, and recited a few short prayers in the official language of his Church. At the con clusion of this performance, on which perhaps no one but a churchman would have ventured, he arose and signified his readiness to proceed. Accordingly he and M. Schoffzan were escorted downstairs to a closed carriage which stood in readiness, and were driven off, the Russian Consul being seen off the premises at the same time. The politician was made to alight at the entrance to the State prison, into which Mr. Baxter had just preceded him, and the other prisoner was carried on to the gates of the monastery. Here he was met by the Superior, who had been informed of his approach, and now came out to welcome his distinguished visitor. The prelate graciously bestowed his blessing upon his involun tary jailor, and in another minute tho gates were closed, and the Chief of Police was on his way back to report to Prince Rodolph. Meanwhile a squad of police had taken possession of the episcopal palace and all its approaches. The servants of the establishment were told that their services would not be required for some days, and were made to quit the premises. A perfunctory search for documents was then"], [119, "THE BISHOP OF SUFAEEST. 107 entered upon, but the Sufarest police were even less successful in this case than they had been in Simski's, for they found absolutely nothing. But then they did not push their search with very much eagerness, owing to the fact that they had been informed, through their Chief, that a distinguished detective from the capital of Austria was on his way to Sufarest, on purpose to take part in the exploration of the Bishop's abode. While these things were happening, and while Monsignor Stefan was still on his way to the monastery, a monk, clad in the familiar robes of the order of St. George, presented himself at the gate of the State prison of Sufarest, and asked to see the Governor. He was brought into his presence, and as soon as they were alone, he handed the functionary a note in the handwriting of Prince Rodolph, which consisted simply of the following words : \u2014 \" To the Governor of the State Prison. \" Admit the monk who brings you this, to see the political prisoners. \"Rodolph of Balkistan.\" The Governor read the note, bowed respectfully, and observed \u2014 \" I have just received two prisoners who are classed as political, in addition to Simski Simskivitch. One is M. Schoffzan, the other is an American who gives the name of Ezekiel P. Baxter. Which do you desire to see first? \" \"I will see Baxter now. I may return to see the other later in the day.\""], [120, "108 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. \" Very good,\" replied the Governor. And, having summoned the head warder, he ordered him to conduct the visitor to the cell of No. 15. The warder led the way up some steps and along a corridor to the cell bearing that number. He opened the door with a key which was attached to his wrist by an iron chain, and inquired at what time he should return to let out the visitor. \" Come again in ten minutes,\" was the reply. The next moment the door clanged to, and Count Halstein and Mr. Verriter were cordially shaking hands."], [121, "109 CHAPTER VII. THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. It must not be supposed that the chamber in which Mr. Ezekiel P. Baxter found himself lodged was a gloomy dungeon, of the kind which romance has associated with political prisoners. There were no bare stone walls dropping with damp, no rats to scamper across the floor by night, no cobwebs, not even a spider to be tamed by the prisoner in the weary hours of captivity, and taught to come and eat crumbs from his hand. The rough besom of modern civilization has swept away all these picturesque adjuncts to imprison ment. Nowadays a State prisoner is treated with honour, his portrait appears in the illustrated papers, and he lives as handsomely in jail as in his own hotel. When Count Halstein, in his disguise, crossed the threshold of No. 15, therefore, instead of a dark and noisome cell, he found himself in a comfortable, boarded room, well lighted, and provided with a fire place ; and the captive, instead of lying on a straw pallet containing spiders, was comfortably seated in an armchair, reading a newspaper, and taking occa sional sips from a tumbler which stood on a table by his side."], [122, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 110 \" I see the Czar has left Petersburg for Gatschina,\" he observed, after welcoming the pretended monk. \" Apparently he does not consider himself safe in his capital.\" \" Well, he needn't expect sympathy from me,\" retorted Halstein. As he spoke he was hastily unfastening his hood and gown. In pursuance of the scheme arranged the night before, he had assumed this disguise at the hour fixed upon for the arrests, and had timed himself to arrive at the prison almost as soon as Mr. Verriter. Having stripped off the monk's costume he handed it to the detective, who had at the same time been engaged in denuding himself of his frock-coat, a resplendent garment gleaming with the indescribable gleam which marks out the wealthy American among millions. In transferring this garment to Count Halstein, Mr. Baxter was transferring to him his individuality; it was by his frock-coat that his jailors knew him, it was the frock-coat that had been arrested, and as long as the frock-coat remained within the walls of the prison, they would not seek to pry further into the personality behind it. This, then, was the plan adopted for enabling the detective to take part in the search about to be made, without allowing any one to suspect that Mr. Ezekiel P. Baxter was not still closely confined to his cell. The Count donned the enchanted frock-coat and sat himself down with his back, that is to say, with his gleam, to the door, in case any of the warders should take a passing look in; and Mr. Verriter donned the monk's disguise, and prepared to issue forth as soon as the ten minutes should be up."], [123, "THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. 111 \"Have the others been arrested?\" Mr. Verriter asked, while the exchange was being effected. \"Yes,\" answered Count Halstein. \"I learned from the Governor that Schoffzan was here aheady, and I believe that the Bishop is by now safe inside his monastery.\" \"And you have warned the Chief of Police to expect the arrival of a detective from Vienna ? \" \"Yes ; I informed him that the Prince had secured the services of an Austrian who was a specialist at this kind of work. The Chief appears to me to be a thoroughly honest fellow, and I think you will find him prepared to work loyally with you.\" \" We shall see. Did you give him the password ? \" \" Vienna.\" \" Good. I shall have to make a thorough inves tigation of the episcopal palace, so that I'm afraid your stay here may be a long one.\" \" It does not matter in the least. I have brought a couple of books and some cigars. The only thing I have to fear is that the warder may address me, in which case he might recognize me by my voice.\" \"Make your mind easy as to that. I will give orders that you are not to be disturbed.\" A few more questions and answers passed, and then the jailor's rap was heard at the door. The detective rose, pulled his hood closely round his face, and walked out of the chamber. The two men were nearly of the same height, and the substitution passed completely unnoticed. The monk requested to be taken to the Governor, as he had a message to leave with him. This was done, but when the detective found him self face to face with the Governor, he was alarmed"], [124, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 112 to see that personage staring at him very hard, as if puzzled by something in his appearance. It was necessary to lull his suspicions at all hazards, it being impossible to say whether he, or for that matter any official in Balkistan, was not in the secret pay of Russia. Recollecting that the Governor must have recently heard the tones of Count Halstein's voice, and would probably remember them, Mr. Verriter took the pre caution to sink his own tones to a whisper, first glancing anxiously round the Governor's room, as if in fear of being overheard. \"I have had a short conference with Number 15,\" he whispered, \"and I have much reason to hope that he may be induced to reveal important secrets. On behalf of Prince Rodolph I have to beg that no one may be admitted to speak to him, or even to see him, until I return \u2014 with the exception of the warder who may have to carry in his meals.\" The Governor's suspicions, if he had any, were completely removed by this, and he promised that these directions should be scrupulously obeyed. The detective then made his way out of the prison without hindrance, and took the direction of Mon signor Stefan's residence. By this time there was an unusual stir in the city of Sufarest. The news of the Metropolitan's arrest and enforced \" seclusion,\" as it was officially termed, had spread rapidly, together with the information that the leader of the Czar's party was in prison. The excited crowd, with an instinct which did not wait for proofs, at once connected these startling events with the recent attempt to assassinate Prince Rodolph ; and loud was the horror expressed at the"], [125, "THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. 113 idea that the head of the Balkiard hierarchy should have been implicated in so revolting an outrage. The people reminded each other of the support and countenance which Stefan had afforded to the abductors of Prince Iskander. They also remem bered the opposition which he had made to the elec tion of the present Prince, and the reluctance he had shown to extend him the formal recognition of the Church. All these things pointed one way, and threw a dark shadow on the character of the prelate. But still, enough respect for his office and sacerdotal character lingered in the minds of the Balkiards to restrain them from open demonstrations of hostility. A large crowd had gathered round the gates of the empty palace, but it gave forth no utterance, except a confused murmur, composed of voices from so many throats. The attitude of the people towards the Chief of the Russophile faction was very different. They had long hated Schoffzan, whom they regarded as a traitor to the cause of the national independence. It was per fectly well known that he was in the pay of Russia, and his efforts to subjugate the free Balkiards to the yoke of the most grinding despotism the world has ever seen were not likely to make him a favourite with his countrymen. Although these feelings had long prevailed in the bosoms of the populace, an occasion had hitherto been wanted to display their hatred. This difficulty was now removed. The arrest of their enemy seemed to be the signal for an outpouring of open indignation, and, accordingly, a mass of excited people had sur rounded the house of the imprisoned man, with the evident intention of reducing it to a wreck. i"], [126, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 114 Unfortunately for them, the Government had antici pated the likelihood of such a proceeding, and had taken measures to guard against it. M. Karkchulov had no wish to proceed to extremities against a friend of the Czar's, and in fact was not sorry to have an opportunity for rendering him a service, foreseeing the time when he might come to need M. Schoffzan's good offices on his own behalf. As soon as he had consented to the arrest, which he only did under the most urgent pressure from Rodolph, the head of the Ministry had therefore posted a detachment of twenty soldiers in front of his opponent's residence. When the mob came up they thus found an obstacle to their design. Still, they would not go away. They remained in front of the house, uttering occasional shouts of defiance and rage. Their numbers grew as the minutes passed, and the officer in charge of the detachment began to feel alarmed for the result. It was necessary for the seeming monk to pass by the spot, on his way to Monsignor Stefan's, and he too was struck with alarm by the menacing demeanour of the people, whose growing masses looked ready to overwhelm the little corps which guarded the building. It was impossible for him to interfere, however, and he hurried on to the palace, where he found the people in a much quieter mood, as already mentioned. He slipped through them, and presented himself at the gate. Here he was stopped by a sentry. He at once gave the password, \" Vienna ; \" but the soldier had evidently not been informed of it, for he still refused admittance to the detective. \"Is the Chief of Police inside?\" demanded the Englishman, impatiently."], [127, "THE FOEEIGN DETECTIVE. 115 \"No,\" rephed the sentry; \"he has gone to the monastery of Saint George with the Bishop; and I have strict orders to admit no one till he returns.\" \"But he is expecting me. I have come all the way from Vienna on purpose,\" remonstrated the detective. \" U you had come all the way from heaven it would make no difference,\" returned the soldier, im passively. \" You cannot come in.\" Mr. Verriter stamped his foot with impatience at this delay, though he could not refrain from admiring the sentry's firmness. \"While he was still hesitating how to act, there came the sound of a loud yell from the direction of Schoff zan's house. At once the people round the palace rushed off towards the sound, and the Englishman followed in the rear. When he reached the spot, a fearful scene presented itself to him. The angry mob had succeeded at last in lashing itself on to an attack on the premises of the enemy, and the twenty soldiers were maintaining a gallant but hopeless struggle against overwhelming odds. Their officer had refused to give the word to fire till it was too late, and the people were in the act of charging. The soldiers had then let off their pieces in such haste that only two bullets took effect. One entered the back of the head of an old man, who had turned and was trying to get away out of the tumult. His brains spattered the dress of a young woman as he fell. The other bullet smashed in between the eyes of a lad of fifteen who was running forward, laughing, in the front rank of the assailants. The remaining shots passed harmlessly over the people's heads."], [128, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 116 The young boy had no time to do more t'.ian utter a great sob of horror as the fatal ball buried itself in his skull. He dropped forward on his face, and the pavement was instantly reddened by a rush of blood. This sight had roused the beholders to frenzy. They uttered a yell which had been heard as far off as the Bishop's palace, and sprang with ferocity upon the soldiers. Unlike the mobs of the great Western capitals, the present gathering was largely composed of men who had done some fighting in their time. Their long subjection to the hated rule of Turkey, moreover, had familiarized them with the idea of conflicts with authority. The soldiers, seeing their danger, closed up together, and some defended themselves with their bayonets, while others seized their rifles by the barrel and used them as clubs. As the foreign detective came up, he was met by a sight with which the streets of his own capital were happily unfamiliar. Three of the soldiers had aheady fallen, and had disappeared beneath the feet of the multitude. Of the remainder, one was in the act of striking down an assailant with the butt of his gun ; a second was vainly struggling in the grasp of a powerful fellow with a smith's hammer, who had clutched his victim by the throat with one hand, and was bringing down the hammer, time after time, with a horrid crunch upon the writhing creature's head. At each fresh blow the soldier made a frantic struggle to withdraw his head from the hammer, and the smith cursed him aloud for not standing still. A tall man, well-dressed, and looking like a shopkeeper in comfortable circumstances, had just thrown him self on the bayonet-point of another of the soldiers,"], [129, "THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. 117 at whom he was endeavouring to aim a blow with a large, rough piece of board, which looked as if he had snatched it up somewhere unconsciously. A huge stone, flung from behind, at this moment descended on the neck of the soldier, and he and his foe rolled on the ground together. Their quiver ing bodies were instantly trampled out of all pos sibility of recognition by the feet of the mob, which had now gained the advantage, and was driving the soldiers rapidly from their post. The fight had been chiefly waged on the pavement at the foot of a flight of steps leading up to the politician's door. The rest of the soldiers were now dashed aside, and the crowd poured up the steps. In less than no time the door was battered into splinters, and the foremost invaders rushed with a shout of triumph into the house. Scarcely had the twelfth man passed inside before a cloud of smoke came pouring out of a window on the right-hand side of the door. The building had been fired by the rioters. At this moment the Chief of Police reached the corner of the street on his return from escorting the Metropolitan to his place of confinement. He was met at the corner by a troop of soldiers, under the command of an experienced officer, who were hasten ing to the relief of their comrades. Of the original detachment of twenty only nine now remained on their feet, and these were being separated from each other and pressed upon by the infuriated multitude. At the same time the smoke was being rapidly suc ceeded by flames, and the rush into the house was checked. An instant was sufficient to arouse the new-comers"], [130, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 118 to a sense of their comrades' peril. Their officer promptly gave the word of command, and, first firing a well-aimed volley, the troop, some fifty in number, charged upon the crowd. A shriek answered the discharge of the rifles. At least two dozen men had fallen before the fatal volley. The courage of the rest vanished at once ; they fled down the street, and when the receiving party arrived in front of the burning house there was no one left to offer resistance. The roadway and pavement were strewn with dead and wounded men, soldiers and citizens being mingled together in ghastly confusion. The sur vivors of the first detachment hailed their deliverers with emotion, and in the relief of the first moments no one noticed what was happening inside the house. The foreign observer of this terrible drama, which had only occupied a very few minutes, was the first to remember that the burning building was not empty. Several of those who had entered it had been carried upstairs in the first rush, and, busy in seeking for plunder, only discovered, when it was too late, that the flames had cut off their retreat. Their haggard faces now appeared at the windows of the upper floors, whence they gazed desperately round for some means of escape. One poor wretch, having opened the window at which he stood, took the fearful resolution of leaping down from the second floor. Apparently he hoped to alight on a heap of four corpses which were piled up against a railing in front of the house. But he miscalculated his jump, and, after turning over and over three times in the air, he ultimately pitched face downwards right across the railing, so that one of the spikes entered his"], [131, "THE FOEEIGN DETECTIVE. 119 chest. He gave a few convulsive movements, draw ing up his limbs under him like a tortoise, but before he could be extricated by the soldiers who had rushed to his assistance, he had ceased to breathe. This horrid spectacle had the effect of dissuading the other victims of their own rashness from venturing on any similar means of escape. But one man, a ferocious-looking fellow whose pockets and hands were filled with booty from the rooms he had passed through, made up his mind to attempt the passage outward by the door. The hall was by this time one mass of fire, and the balustrade of the staircase was burning all the way up. Nevertheless, he made the descent successfully. On arriving at the bottom of the stairs all his hair had been singed off, his clothes were on fire in one or two places, and he had been obliged to drop a clock from his left hand, which had shrivelled up from the heat of the burning banisters. He now nerved himself for the rush through the hall. It was a matter of three great springs. The first brought him into the furnace, he had still strength enough for the second, when suddenly his feet gave way under him, literally scorched to cinders, and with an expiring jerk, he dropped forward on to the bed of flame. The heat had already cracked every bone and sinew ; as he fell the flames wrapped his body, and the tissues of the neck were eaten away in an instant. The lifeless head parted from the trunk, and rolled, a charred, black fragment, through the doorway and down into the street. The soldiers outside actually did not recognize the human character of the object which rolled down the steps of the fatal building. But the man's com panions, who had watched him down the stairs, and"], [132, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 120 then rushed to the windows to look out for his escape, uttered a groan of horror. They at once gave up all hope of life, and happily to end their suspense the first and second floors now fell in together with a crash, and the hapless wretches perished instantaneously. Then, and not before, a fire-engine arrived on the scene, quickly followed by another, and ere long there was nothing left of the tragedy but a heap of smouldering bricks. Up to the arrival of the engines the disguised Englishman had remained a passive spectator of these incidents. He had been sheltered, alike from observation and from the danger of stray missiles, by a doorway in which he had placed himself, on the opposite side of the street. He now emerged, mutter ing to himself as he did so, \"I wonder what the Czar will say to this ? It is a fine specimen of his handiwork.\" His sudden appearance drew the attention of the Chief of Police, who was giving directions to the firemen. He turned and regarded the seeming monk with looks of suspicion. \" You are the Chief of Police, I believe ? \" \" I am. What are you doing here ? \" \" You are expecting the arrival of an officer of the Austrian force, are you not ? \" The Chief seemed surprised. \" Who told you that ? \" he demanded. \"I am the man you are expecting,\" was the reply. \"My name is Muller, and I come from Vienna.\" He laid an emphasis on the last word. The other bowed, but, as if still uncertain of his ground, inquired\u2014"], [133, "THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. 121 \" Were you given any sign by which to enable me to recognize you ? \" Herr Muller smiled. \" Your caution does you honour, sir. But, as you know, I have already pronounced the word agreed upon.\" This time the Chief of Police had no further excuse for hesitation. He at once extended his hand, and expressed the pleasure it gave him to meet so dis tinguished a member of his own profession. Some of the city police having by this time come up, they then quitted the scene, and went onward to the episcopal quarters. While these events had been taking place, M. Nelidoff had not been idle. Immediately on leaving the scene of the arrests he had gone to his official residence, and drawn up a telegram to the Foreign Minister at Petersburg, informing him of what had taken place, and asking for instructions. The arrival of the news produced something like consternation in the Russian official breast. They had been so long accustomed to think of Balkistan as a place where any intrigues might be carried on, and any outrages perpetrated with impunity, that it was a disagreeable surprise to find at last that there was a power of resistance at Sufarest, and that the new Prince of the country was capable of acts of decision and defiance. The Foreign Minister instantly wired to the Consul-General to make strong unofficial representations of the Czar's displeasure to Prince Rodolph. At the same time, the Russian ambassador at Constantinople received orders to wait at once upon the Sultan of Turkey, and protest in the Czar's name against the indignity offered to a high prelate"], [134, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 122 of his Church. He was instructed to bring the strongest pressure to bear to secure Monsignor Stefan's instant release. Having taken these preliminary measures, the Foreign Minister despatched a special messenger to the fortress of Gatschina, where the Czar was, and also sent out summonses for a special meeting of his colleagues in the Ministry. On receiving his instructions, M. Nelidoff hastened to the royal palace, revolving as he went the best way to gain admittance to Prince Rodolph. Hitherto it had been part of the stand made by Russia against the legality of Rodolph's position, to forbid the Consul-General to accord him any official recogni tion. M. Nelidoff was not formally accredited to the court of Sufarest, therefore, and had no claim to insist on an audience as a matter of international right. When he reached the palace he alighted from his carriage, and presented to the chief porter a card on which was inscribed, \" M. Nelidoff, Russian Consul- General.\" \"I desire to speak to Prince Rodolph,\" was all he said. The attendants received M. Nelidoff respectfully, and conducted him to a lofty reception-room, while the card was passed through a series of hands till it reached Prince Rodolph himself. He glanced at it with astonishment. \" What does this mean ? \" he asked himself, for he was alone, owing to the absence of Count Halstein on the errand already described. \"Can they have determined to recognize me at the very moment I have dealt them such an open blow ? Or is this"], [135, "THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. 123 merely an attempt to browbeat me ? I must ascer tain more before I let this man in.\" And calling in the page who had brought him the card, he said \u2014 \" Ask the bearer of this card whether he comes as the accredited representative of Russia to the Prince of Balkistan, or in what character ? \" The page made his way back to the Consul, to whom he repeated Prince Rodolph's words. M. Nelidoff bit his lips. He had hoped to glide over this difficulty, and to impose an official cha racter upon the Prince, without committing his own Government. He was now obliged to take a more open course. \"Tell his Highness that M. Nelidoff seeks an audience of Prince Rodolph on public business of an urgent character.\" The insulting answer was duly conveyed to the Prince. He frowned with anger, and paced up and down the room several times before he would trust himself to frame a reply. But after all, he reflected, he had gone too far for it to be worth while to keep on any terms with the enemy. It was just as well to abandon all pretences, and to let the Czar see how httle he feared him. His spirits rose at the thought of defiance, and he asked himself why, in the posses sion of his people's affection and the respect of the civilized world, he should care for the menaces of a half-savage despot and his Polar barbarians. He stopped short in his walk, fixed his eye on the messenger, and handed him back the visitor's card, with these words \u2014 \" Tell the gentleman that Prince Rodolph does not know him, and refers him to his secretary.\""], [136, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 124 When the Russian received this crushing rejoinder he gnashed his teeth, and even swore aloud. \"He shall repent this, by God! \" he cried. And he hastened away from the palace, to transmit the news of this fresh defiance to his Government. At this very moment the Russian envoy at Con stantinople was entering the presence of the Turkish Foreign Minister. Since the great war of a few years back, in which the Turkish empire had been defeated and partially dismembered by the late Czar of Russia, the former power had been habitually bullied by the latter. The heavy war indemnity then exacted was still unpaid, as regards the greater portion, and whenever the northern Power desired to put pressure on the Sultan, it was only necessary to make a demand for the overdue interest. In a part of Ireland, some years ago, a custom prevailed in the agricultural districts which was known as the hanging gale. By law, a tenant could not be evicted unless his rent were in arrear, and therefore, to facilitate the land lord's powers of eviction, it was usual not to demand the first \" gale,\" or instalment, when it became due, but to allow it to be met at the date when the second gale became payable, and to keep the second hanging over the tenant's head till the third pay day arrived, and so on throughout the term. By this plan the tenant was perpetually in arrears, and was thus liable to eviction at any moment. A similar device was employed by Russia in respect of her claims on account of the indemnity. Payment was allowed to get into arrears, but at every fresh crisis a formal demand for the unpaid amounts was presented to the Sultan, who could only evade it"], [137, "THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. 125 by performing the services required of him at the moment. This expedient was promptly put in force on the present occasion. Count Maritz, the ambassador, waited upon the Turkish Minister with the stereo typed document calling the attention of his Govern ment to the amount that was overdue, and requesting that the Czar might be informed when payment would be made. The Minister at once scented mischief. He did not pay much attention to the demand for the indemnity, having been through the same per formance several times before. He waited in some anxiety to hear the real object of the ambassador's visit. Having received no intelligence as yet of the events in Sufarest, he was quite at a loss what to expect. Count Maritz did not keep him long in suspense. Laying down the diplomatic note which he had brought, he added \u2014 \" I am also instructed by his Majesty to express the surprise and indignation with which he has heard of the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of his friend and fellow-Christian, the Metropohtan Bishop of Sufarest.\" The Turk started slightly. He would not admit his ignorance, however, for there is nothing which diplomatists value so highly as their character for omniscience. He rephed with great presence of mind \u2014 \" His Majesty the Sultan was equally surprised when he heard of the step. As you are aware, it is within the powers given by treaty to the Bal kiard Government ; nevertheless, we have sought for"], [138, "126 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. explanations of so serious a measure, and hope shortly to hear of his Grace's release.\" \" How soon are you likely to be in a position to tell me that he is released?\" asked the Count, somewhat mollified by the other's readiness to meet him. The Minister shrugged his shoulders. \" You must give me a week,\" he said. \" You know these things cannot be hurried over, and it would be an infraction of the Treaty of Berlin if the Sultan were to take any coercive measures.\" \"You forget that that treaty has been infringed several times already,\" retorted the ambassador. \" Remember that the fact of our indemnity being unpaid is itself a breach.\" (The other winced.) \" If the Czar does not hear something satisfactory within the next two days, I am instructed to state that he will advise himself as to what steps are necessary to secure payment.\" And Count Maritz departed, leaving his listener in a very uneasy frame of mind. A telegram in emphatic terms was soon on its way to the Balkiard Premier, demanding an explana tion of the arrest, and denouncing the folly of his Government in provoking enemies far too powerful to be resisted. M. Karkchulov, whose own sentiments thoroughly coincided with those expressed in this despatch, at once started with it for the palace, to see if he could bring Prince Rodolph to reason. The evening was drawing on as he found himself in the Prince's presence, and he saw at a glance that Rodolph was suffering under some anxiety. Prince Rodolph was, in fact, becoming impatient"], [139, "THE FOREIGN DETECTIVE. 127 at the absence of all news from Mr. Verriter. He could only suppose that a thorough search was proceeding in the Bishop's palace, but what the results might be, of course he could not tell. All hope of finding anything to incriminate M. Schoff zan had been put an end to by the destruction of his house. Worried and ill at ease the Prince was beginning to fear that he had been too rash, and he was ill prepared to resist the representations of his Minister. As soon as he had read the despatch from Con stantinople, he remarked \u2014 \" Of course the Russian ambassador has dictated this.\" \" Your Highness sees that something must be done,\" responded M. Karkchulov. \" There is no doubt that the old Treaty of Adrianople gives the Czar the right to protect all the members of his Church throughout the Sultan's dominions, and he has therefore a right to demand either the proof of some crime against Monsignor Stefan, or his speedy release.\" The Prince was silent. He perceived the difficulty in which he was placed. Even if the proofs he hoped for were discovered, it did not follow that it would suit him to institute a prosecution against the Bishop. There were other objects in view of higher import ance than the trial or conviction of the ecclesiastic. M. Karkchulov saw the Prince's hesitation, and pressed his advantage. \"What answer had I better make to the Turkish Government ? \" Reluctantly Rodolph made up his mind to draw back. He would only stipulate for twenty-four hours' delay."], [140, "128 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. . \" Say that unless certain proofs which we expected are forthcoming by this time to-morrow, the prisoners will be released.\" Hardly had the words crossed his lips when there was a knock at the door leading into his private apartments. A look of relief crossed the Prince's face. \" Come in ! \" he cried. It was Count Halstein who entered. In another moment the Prime Minister had bowed himself out, and Rodolph was alone with his friend."], [141, "129 CHAPTER VIII. THE SEARCH. It was now some hours since the destruction of M. Schoffzan's house. During the interval Mr. Ver riter had gone through incredible exertions. Not placing the smallest faith in any member of the Balkiard police force, nor, indeed, in any foreigner of whatever persuasion, he had insisted on conducting the entire search by himself. Owing to the precautions taken at the time of the arrest, it was certain that nothing could have been carried off from Stefan's palace. If he had had any documents in his possession, therefore, it was simply a question of time and ingenuity to find them out. Herr Muller, to call him by the name he had assumed for the benefit of the Chief of Police, began his work on the way to the palace by questioning the Chief as to the arrest. \" When you took our friend into custody,\" he said, \"did you notice whether he looked hard in any particular direction, or showed anxiety to go into any particular room ? \" The Balkiard stared. Impressed by the familiarity with which his companion spoke of the prisoner, he was struck with reverential wonder at a question K"], [142, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 130 which seemed to divine exactly what had taken place on the occasion of the arrest. \" Why, that was just what happened,\" he returned. ' ' The Bishop wanted to go and say a prayer in his oratory, and was quite angry when I refused to let him out of my sight.\" \" Good,\" said the other ; \" you did well.\" The Balkiard officer smiled with pleasure. \"And now,\" continued the supposed native of Vienna, \" we can begin our search with some system.\" They were entering the building as he spoke, and only paused to renew the order to the sentries to admit no one on any pretext whatever, without obtaining their consent. The palace was a massive structure in stone, of some antiquity. It rose to a height of three stories in front, and possessed two extensive wings. The entrance hall in the middle led up to a wide staircase going straight up to a back floor, which was arranged at a height half-way between the levels of the ground floor and first floor of the front half of the building, the first floor in front again coming at a level half way between the first and second floors behind. This alternating arrangement was continued to the top of the staircase, where the roof took a steep slant from front to rear, and covered one more story in front than behind. Now, the room in which the arrest had been made was on the first floor in front, immediately opposite the staircase. But it was necessary to inspect the back suite of rooms before ascending, in case the oratory should happen to be in that part of the edifice. The floor to which they had thus come to commence their search displayed three doors, right, left, and"], [143, "TnE SEARCH. 131 centre. The first of these led into a well-furnished library, the middle door into a dressing-room com municating with the library, and fitted up with baths and other appliances of modern civilization, and the left door revealed to them the prelate's bedroom, which in turn had a door through into the dressing room. The bedroom, which struck Mr. Verriter as being remarkably narrow compared with the other rooms, disclosed a cause for this, in the shape of a curtained archway in the farthest corner. He made a dive for the curtain, snatched it back, and laid bare the oratory, which was evidently partitioned off on one side of the bedchamber. Yet, instead of appearing pleased with this dis covery, the detective's face wore a look of extreme disappointment. Instead of the safe which he had hoped to see, the apartment before him was absolutely bare of everything but the religious appurtenances usual in a place of the kind. The floor was naked of any carpet, there was nothing in the shape of a seat, and the only vestige of luxury was a little mat on the step in front of the altar, used no doubt by the Bishop to rest his knees upon while going through the mass. Watching his companion's lengthening face, the Chief of Police observed \u2014 \"I suppose we shall have to make our search without a clue, after all ?\" \"Oh dear no!\" replied the other. \"It is true I had hoped to find a strong-box or something of the sort in this place ; but you see that if our man had got leave to come in here, he could have closed the door of his bedroom, and so had the run of the dressing-room and library. We must stick to these"], [144, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 132 rooms. I will search every volume on the shelves, if necessary, before I leave this floor.\" The Chief shrugged his shoulders at the prospect of such a task. Without waiting for his answer, the speaker went on \u2014 \"But I haven't done with this place yet. There may be some hole or corner under that altar.\" And he stepped slowly towards it, eyeing the walls and planking of the room with the closest scrutiny as he passed along. The altar, which constituted the sole furniture of the oratory, was a species of square table, or box with solid sides, standing about four feet high against the end wall of the oratory. The Chief, who was a member of the Metropolitan's flock, felt a little shocked at these proceedings, and stayed by the entrance, which came in on one side of the narrow apartment, but towards the opposite end from that against which the altar was placed. From here he watched his companion with fascinated eyes, as the detective calmly approached the altar, took up the little mat, shook it, curled it round to see if he could hear the rustling of concealed papers, and finally prodded it all over with a long steel pin which he had brought with him. Before replacing the mat he took out a small hammer and sounded every inch of the step from wall to wall, but without result. He then pulled up the drapery which hung round three sides of the altar (the fourth being against the wall) and prodded the material with the pin. Next he tapped the sides of the altar, which simply presented the appearance of a large chest. They gave forth a hollow sound, but the closest scrutiny failed to disclose any secret spring or opening. Coming reluctantly to"], [145, "THE SEARCH. 133 the conclusion that there could be nothing inside the altar, he now devoted himself to the articles upon it. The top was covered with a richly embroidered cloth on which stood a picture of the Crucifixion, and in front of it a couple of candlesticks, a ciborium \u2014 that is to say, a sort of butter-dish with a cover, containing the consecrated wafer \u2014 and lastly a chalice or goblet. Transferring these articles one by one to the floor, he took the precaution to peep into the chalice and to lift the lid of the ciborium, before setting them down. The Balkiard officer had watched his other pro ceedings with a mixture of horror at their profanity and admiration at their thoroughness, but this last piece of irreverence fairly took away his breath. He exclaimed \u2014 \" Surely, Herr Muller, you do not suspect the Bishop of concealing political documents in the sacred vessels ! \" Mr. Verriter gave an amused chuckle. \"My friend, you forget that familiarity breeds contempt. Monsignor Stefan handles these things every day, and probably thinks no more of them than you do of a warrant of arrest, which frightens ordinary men.\" And he calmly pursued his investigations. The cloth was lifted from the altar, and went through the same process of shaking, rolling, and prodding as the mat. There remained the picture of the Crucifixion, and this emblem even the hardened Englishman approached with some respect. But it was his duty to test it, and he did not shrink. All his efforts, however, were fruitless. Replacing the cloth on the altar, he took his hammer and went carefully over the walls of the oratory, including the thin boarding"], [146, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 134 which separated it from the bedroom. But the sounds given out furnished no indication of anything concealed. The floor was next subjected to the same test, again without any discovery being arrived at. The Chief at length became impatient, and sug gested that they had better begin on the bedroom. Verriter reluctantly acquiesced, and came with lin gering steps through the archway. As, however, he stepped through into the larger room his eye suddenly lit up, he darted a glance down the bedroom side of the partition, and uttered a cry of joy. \"What is it?\" eagerly asked his companion, turning back from a bureau into which he had been casting some vague glances. \" Look ! \" replied Verriter, beckoning the Chief to the spot where he stood himself, and making him look first down one side, and then down the other, of the partition. The Balkiard drew back puzzled. He had noticed nothing. \" Don't you see ? \" cried the Englishman. \" The bedroom side goes at least four feet farther back than the other. There must be a secret compartment behind the altar.\" \" Ah ! \" cried the other, struck with admiration. \"You are right. We must examine the end wall again.\" The detective smiled to himself at the word \"we,\" and strode hastily back to the altar end of the oratory. He renewed his tapping, and went all over the lower part of the wall, but without discovering any indication of a spring. \" I must get up on the altar to reach the upper half of the wall,\" he observed, and proceeded to"], [147, "THE SEARCH. 135 remove the cloth and vessels once more, and climb on the top. And now an unexpected thing occurred. No sooner had Verriter drawn his feet off the floor, in the act of lifting himself up, than the altar itself commenced to move, and to sink slowly downwards through the floor. The Balkiard officer, who was watching at a little distance, uttered a cry of dismay, and darted forward to catch his ally before he disappeared. But that person was equal to the occasion. Thoroughly sur prised for the first moment, he immediately realized that the secret of the concealed compartment was now within his grasp. He therefore remained with his weight pressing on the altar, while holding him self ready to leap off the moment it should become necessary. His utmost hopes were fulfilled as the gradual removal of the obstruction revealed a large opening in the end wall, about three feet square. As soon as the top of the descending altar had sunk to the level of the step or dais on which it had stood, the downward motion stopped, and a couple of iron hooks, acted on by an automatic spring, shot out from the bottom of the aperture and retained the altar in its place. It was now perfectly easy for any one to pass in through the opening, and explore its recesses at his ease. The mechanism of the hiding place was plainly revealed. When it was desired to close up the opening again it was only necessary to thrust back the iron hooks into their place, when the altar would be released, and at once raised by the powerful spring which it contained, to its ordinary level. The delight of the Chief of Police was touching at"], [148, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 136 the revelation of this mystery. At the same time, his reverence for the hierarch of his Church received a rude shock by the consideration of the means which Stefan had not scrupled to employ for the purposes of concealment. But no time was now wasted in reflection. Both men bent down and successively crept through the hole in the wall, Verriter going first. They found themselves at the foot of a dark, narrow stairway \u2014 it might almost be called a ladder \u2014 to the top of which there was not light enough for them to see. Up this the Englishman swarmed impetuously, till his head bumped against a wooden trap-door at the top. He put up his hand and lifted the trap without delay. He then completed his ascent of the ladder, and found himself in what he could guess was a chamber of some size, but which was shrouded in absolute darkness. Not choosing to risk an exploration in the dark, he called down to his comrade to obtain a box of matches and some candles, and while they were being procured he prudently remained seated on the top of the steps. After a short delay, due to the necessity for the Chief to descend and forage for himself in the epis copal kitchens for what he wanted, the welcome light gleamed upon Verriter from below, and the Chief crept up, bearing a lighted candle in one hand. Verriter eagerly snatched another from him, lit it at the first, and led the way into the centre of the mysterious room. The hidden chamber appeared to be constructed immediately under the roof of the palace, and over the apartment which came above the prelate's bed room. It was more than fifteen paces in one direction"], [149, "THE SEARCH. 137 by about twelve in the other, but the ceiling was nowhere higher than a tall man's head, and at one side it sloped down to within a couple of feet of the flooring. This was of plain planking, the room being absolutely devoid of ornamental furniture of any kind. What it did contain, however, was enough to occupy the keenest attention of the pair who had penetrated to its recesses. They looked round for the first moment almost with awe. It seemed as if this hiding-place must have been constructed when the edifice itself was put up, and might have contained the secrets of succes sive occupiers of the see of Sufarest. In the dark days of Turkish rule, and through the troubles of rebellion and foreign war, who could say to what purposes this dark alcove might not have been turned ? These thoughts passed rapidly through their minds as they gazed around. The trap-door through which they had ascended was situated in one corner of the room. Save just in its vicinity the entire length of the four walls was lined with sacks, standing as high as the roof permitted, while in the middle of the room rose an imposing object, concealed under a heavy black pall, but assuming beneath the folds of this covering the unmistakable outlines of a human form. Naturally their first impulse was to discover what was hidden beneath the cloth. Each seized a corner, and lifted it back, disclosing a sight which caused them both a shock, amounting in the case of the Balkiard to positive consternation. It was as if they beheld Stefan himself, miraculously escaped from his imprisonment, and lying asleep or in death at their feet."], [150, "138 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. A moment's scrutiny enabled Verriter to see that what they were looking at was a waxen image, wrought to a marvellous likeness of the living man, and quite sufficient to deceive those best acquainted with the Metropolitan's features, in the obscurity of the cham ber. Whether this extraordinary object had been placed there with the view of terrifying any intruder who should succeed in finding his way in, or whether it was there merely for purposes of concealment, and had been designed to serve other objects by being placed in the original's bed while he was occupied elsewhere, the detective and his companion had no means of ascertaining. They took the precaution of searching the figure, which was only formed of wax so far as the head, bust, and hands were con cerned, the remainder being of hollow indiarubber. But they found nothing, and the white robe in which it was wrapped was examined, equally without result. It was now time to deal with the sacks which lay round the walls. Here a fresh difficulty met them. Every sack was tied closely at the mouth, and sealed by the Bishop's signet. To break open the sacks would therefore be to warn him of their proceedings, a contingency which Verriter knew that Prince Rodolph was particularly anxious to avoid. It was therefore necessary, before going further, to obtain the means of counterfeiting the seal. They held a brief discussion, and came to the con clusion of abandoning the search for the moment, till further preparations could be made. The tallow of the candles furnished an easy means of obtaining an impression of the seals, and this secured, they de scended the ladder together, emerged into the oratory,"], [151, "THE SEARCH. 139 and restored the altar to its former position. Then, replacing the articles of religious use, they came away from the room and from the palace. At the gate they renewed the injunction to the sentinel to allow no one to pass. The Chief of Police then hastened to a goldsmith's to obtain the required signet, while Verriter, who now felt confident that some important documents would be unearthed, sought out a photographer's, and procured the necessary apparatus for enabling him to secure undeniable copies of papers which he did not wish to carry away. The object in his view, as in that of his employer's, was to secure the weapons which they desired against their enemy, without putting him on his guard by allowing him to know of their success. The fear that dayhght might be gone before he was in a position to use the camera, induced the detective to provide himself with the means of dis pensing with the assistance of the sun. A long experience of difficult and delicate investigations, some of them not inferior in gravity to this, had left his mind well stored with every device for over coming obstacles such as the present. He was aware that likenesses had been obtained of the interiors of Egyptian tombs and monuments by means of what is called the magnesium hght. A preparation con taining magnesium and chlorate of potash is used, the required quantity being ignited after the sensitized plate has been put into position and exposed. The compound flares up for a couple of seconds, affording a light only inferior to the sun's in brilliancy; the plate, which was previously surrounded in darkness, instantly records the illuminated objects within range, and retains the image after the light has expired."], [152, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 140 From the negative thus obtained, prints can be taken in the ordinary way. Well acquainted with this process, Verriter pro vided himself with the necessary materials, and hastened back to the palace. Here he was met by the impatient Chief, who had given orders for the instant execution of the duplicate seal, directing it to be sent after him as soon as completed. It need not be added, that the goldsmith had received in structions of the most stringent character as to the preservation of secrecy in connection with his task. Re-entering the palace, they made the entrance door fast with lock and bolts, and hurried up to the secret chamber. This time they brought a plentiful supply of candles, and had the attic thoroughly illuminated. With almost feverish excitement they laid hands upon the first of the forty or fifty sacks, and dragged it into the middle of the floor. As they did so the two men looked up at each other with a simultaneous expression of surprise. The sack was extremely heavy, and as they moved it it gave forth a metallic sound. The suspicions roused in their minds were quickly proved correct as Verriter boldly broke off the seal, and tearing open the mouth of the sack, disclosed a shining mass of gold coins to view. \" So this is what the old fox keeps up here ! \" he exclaimed. \" Just imagine hoarding up money like this instead of depositing it in a bank and making a handsome income from it ! \" \"Ah, but you must remember our banks are not quite so safe as yours,\" replied the Balkiard. \"Be sides, people here have been so accustomed to live under a government that seized their wealth at its"], [153, "THE SEARCH. 141 pleasure, that they don't care to have it known how much they possess. No doubt this is some secret fund \" Here the Englishman interrupted him. \" By George, you've hit it ! This money has come from Russia. Let us see if it is their coinage.\" But an inspection revealed that the coinage of more than one country was represented in the hoard, the great bulk being from the Turkish mint. Evidently, if this supply had come from the quarter suggested by the detective, the senders of it had been cunning enough to disguise the fact. Considering it useless to dive further into the sack's contents, Verriter proposed that they should restore it to its place. But the Chief of Police seemed to have other views. He glanced doubtfully at his com panion's face, and then observed in a whisper \u2014 although no human being could have heard him if he had chosen to shout \u2014 \" It seems a pity that no one should have any benefit from this. I think that those who have found the treasure are entitled to \u2014 eh?\" \u2014 and he slowly closed one eye. But the Englishman, whether because he was more righteous, or merely more rich, than his tempter, sternly shook his head, and turned away from the booty. This did not prevent the Balkiard from quietly filling his pockets at odd moments when he thought he was unobserved. And the foreigner was wise enough not to protest actively against what he rightly judged to be a custom of the country, in which its inhabitants would see little to reprehend. The next sack was then opened, and appeared full to the brim of silver. The third sack contained gold"], [154, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 142 again, and after that came three more silver ones. Altogether the room contained no fewer than eleven sacks of gold and three times as many of silver. It was impossible to suppose that the whole of this vast mass of coin had been forthcoming from the exchequer of Russia. The English detective con cluded that the hoard must be the accumulated wealth of the Balkiard Church, scraped together during centuries, and concealed from the avaricious eyes of the grasping Turks. The majority of the coins being inscribed with Turkish characters, totally unlike any with which he was acquainted, the detective could form no estimate of their various ages. At length the seals were all broken, and the contents of every sack laid bare. Then, the excitement of the strange find being abated, the explorers began to recollect that then original search was for papers, and that not a line had been discovered. \" There is no help for it,\" said Verriter, who was the first to wake up to the remembrance of his mission; \"we must empty each of these sacks in turn, and see if there is anything at the bottom.\" \" Is that necessary ? Think of the labour of moving this immense quantity of metal,\" remon strated the Chief. \" No matter. I must be in a position to say that I have exhausted every means of discovery, before I go back and tell his Highness that there is nothing to be found.\" The other had to submit, and between them they commenced their arduous task. The first sack was laid flat upon the floor, and its contents scooped and pushed and finally shaken out"], [155, "THE SEARCH. 143 on to the planks, forming a precious shining heap of not less than twenty thousand pieces of gold. All this was then laboriously put back, and the sack returned to its upright position. Then its neighbour was similarly treated, and a pile of silver rose upon the floor. But when they got close to the bottom of this sack a new surprise awaited them, in the shape of a hard lump which refused to be shaken out. A glow of expectation lit the faces of the two as they quickly stripped back the sacking, and came upon a stout leather bag, which had lain completely hidden beneath the rest of the sack's contents. The bag was sealed, as the sacks had been, but they snatched it open in an instant. They were fairly astonished by the sight which met their eyes. The bag was full of a conglomeration of the most valuable gems. Diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, some of them of unusual bigness, were mingled with a quantity of pearls, somewhat dis coloured with age and neglect, and large numbers of stones such as topazes and amethysts, which have now become nearly valueless. \"Well,\" exclaimed Verriter, \"I don't wonder at the pains our friend Stefan takes to hide all this ! Why, even an American railway director might like to carry off this little bag ! He is a smart man, too, to hide it under the silver, where a robber would be less likely to come at it. I have made a rule never to enrich myself at the expense of professional rectitude, but I can't resist taking just a souvenir from this collection.\" And he calmly selected an antique cameo set with brilliants, and placed it in his pocket. The cameo was in the shape of a brooch or large stud, used by"], [156, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 144 the Balkiard bishops as part of their ecclesiastical uniform, and worn at the neck. This sacrilege was viewed with secret indignation by the Chief of Police, but the contents of his pockets forbade any strong remonstrance, and he merely re marked \u2014 \" Well, in our country we look upon any money that may come into our hands as a sort of legitimate perquisite, but I confess that I should not venture to appropriate an article belonging to the Church \" Rat-tat-tat-a-tat-ta-t-t-ta-tat, tat, tat, TAT !"], [157, "145 CHAPTER IX. THE CZAR OF RUSSIA. The two men, standing alone beside a mass of ancient treasure, in a secret attic lit only by the flames of a few candles, started as the sound of loud knocking was borne upon their ears, and recalled them to the fact that they were in the midst of a busy capital, in the nineteenth century, with the flood of life rushing all around them. Each equally afraid to trust the other alone in the neighbourhood of so much wealth, they came down from the chamber together, and went in company to open the outer door. Two persons were waiting on the steps of the palace, under the guard of the sentry. The first was the goldsmith, who had come in person to discharge his commission, and who put a small box, containing the counterfeit seal, in the hands of the Chief of Police. The other was a monk whose dress proclaimed him to belong to the monastery of St. George, in which Monsignor Stefan was at that moment confined. He bowed respectfully to the head of the Balkiard police, whom he appeared to recognize, and then waited till the jeweller had departed. \" What is it that you want ? \" the Chief then asked him. L"], [158, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 146 \" Can I have a word with you in private ?\" said the monk, casting a suspicious look at the English detective. Mr. Verriter, it should be mentioned, had disencumbered himself of his monk's dress while en gaged in his explorations upstairs, and had neglected to resume it. He therefore appeared in his second shell, that is to say, in the jacket of an Austrian police officer. He was quick to answer the monk's request. \" The Chief of Police and I am jointly responsible here,\" he said, with decision, \" and whatever you have to say must be said to both.\" The monk was disconcerted for an instant. But he quickly rallied, and went on : \u2014 ' ' It does not matter. Only, as my mission is a purely religious one, I thought it better to communi cate it to a member of the faith. I come from our revered Metropolitan, at present suffering imprison ment. His Grace is anxious to enjoy the consola tions of religion, and as the roughness with which he was removed did not permit him to take away his sacramental vessels, he has sent me to fetch the chalice and ciborium on his private altar.\" The detective listened with deepening attention to this speech, and frowned to himself as was his habit when anything puzzled him. Not for a moment did he put faith in the story of Stefan's religious crav ings. For what purpose, then, could he require these articles ? Seeing that he hesitated, and that the Chief maintained a purely neutral attitude, the monk added \u2014 \" If you are in any difficulty as to what articles I refer to, I may say that I know the way to his Grace's"], [159, "THE CZAE OF RUSSIA. i47 oratory, and can find them for myself. I know that he would prefer that they should not be touched by secular hands.\" This piece of diplomacy overshot the mark. If Verriter had suspected before, he now felt certain that some important object was concealed beneath this apparently trivial request. He had already examined the two vessels in question without finding anything. He now determined to make a second and more thorough scrutiny. Banishing the frown from his brow, he smiled pleasantly at the monk, and replied \u2014 \" Our instructions are to allow no one to enter this building, and to allow nothing to be removed from it. But no doubt these orders were not intended to apply to a trifling matter of this kind, especially as it is an affair of religion. You had better go to M. Karkchulov, and he will no doubt order the vessels to be given up to you.\" The messenger did not take kindly to this sug gestion. \" Surely that is making an unnecessary fuss,\" he urged. \" You will run no risk by letting me have these vessels, and I will not come inside myself, if that is forbidden.\" Then, dropping his voice, he added, \"His Grace will consider your granting his request a very great favour, and he has entrusted me with a substantial mark of his gratitude.\" To the astonishment of the Chief, his comrade did riot exhibit any righteous indignation this time. On the contrary, he allowed a sly expression to creep over his features. \"Well,\" he said, \"I suppose we must see if we can't find them. But suspicion will be roused if you"], [160, "THE TEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 148 are seen waiting here. Go for a short walk, and return in half an hour.\" \" That is right,\" answered the monk. \" You shall have the Bishop's present the moment I receive the vessels.\" And ho turned and glided away. As soon as they had fastened the door after him, the Chief began \u2014 \" What do you \u2014 The other cut him short. \" It is all right,\" he said; \" I wished to give him the impression that we were friendly to Stefan, and I will be responsible for the approval of his Highness. Now, you go up and re-seal all the sacks, while I put up these things in a parcel.\" Overjoyed at this order, which he regarded as practically a free permission to help himself, the Chief sped upstairs, without stopping to inquire the reason for this sudden change in the detective's plans. Left to himself, Verriter at once proceeded to the oratory, where he picked up the ciborium and opened it. There was nothing inside except the wafer already referred to, which he was careful not to injure. Ho tapped the bottom with his fingers, and also the lid. Then he placed tho lower part in a level position, and measured its depth from outside. Applying this measurement to the inside, his suspicions of a false bottom were removed. But the same process when applied to the cover produced a different result, the outward height being one and a half inches, while inside it was less than one. A close scrutiny next revealed that the lid was bordered all round the edge by a fine ornamental beading, such as might serve to conceal a line of division. Catching hold of the"], [161, "THE CZAR OF RUSSIA. 149 beading with the finger-nails of one hand, the de tective grasped a species of button on top with the finger and thumb of the other, and sought to turn it round in the expectation of discovering a screw action. But at the first wrench the thing came apart in his hands. The outer lid simply fitted down on the inner one, like the top of a tin mustard box. As he drew them asunder two thin pieces of paper fluttered to the ground. \"By G , Bishop, I have you now! \" muttered the gratified detective, as he stooped and seized the papers. Their contents realized his wildest anticipations. One was a small unmounted photograph of Simski, the assassin, on the back of which were the following words, in French \u2014 \" To the friends of the Czar in Balkistan : Receive the subject, Simski Simskivitch, and assist him in all his enterprises. He is religious, and can be trusted. \"I. Tataroff.\" The other document was not less important, from a political point of view. It consisted of an autograph letter, in Russian, from the Czar himself, and ran as follows : \u2014 \" To our trusty friend and beloved brother in the faith of the Holy Trinity, Stefan, Bishop of Sufarest and Metropolitan of Balkistan : \" We desire to convey to you our hearty thanks for your exertions on our behalf, and to assure you that as soon as the political affairs of Balkistan permit us"], [162, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 150 to effect the happy union of the Churches, we shall take the first opportunity of confiding to you the spiritual government of our empire. \"Iskander III.\" Hardly giving himself time to reflect on the magnitude of his discovery, the detective hurriedly put together his photographic apparatus, and as it was now quite dark, prepared the magnesium light. He placed each writing in front by turns, ignited the chemicals, and had the satisfaction of securing a capital negative in each case. He then reversed the note signed by Tataroff, and re-photographed the assassin's countenance. This done, he replaced the two documents with hands that actually shook with excitement, put the cover together again, replaced it on the ciborium, and was in the act of making it and the cup into a parcel when he heard the monk's knock at the door. He ran down and put the package into the messenger's hands. As he did so a thrill of relief passed over the monk, who at once thrust a note, worth \u00a3100 Enghsh money, into his hand, and rushed away at full speed. Verriter chuckled quietly as he watched his retreat ing figure. \"Fool ! \" he muttered to himself, \" but for your mad attempt to save your secret, it would be undiscovered at this hour.\" He hastened back to the scene of operations, and carefully concealed his precious negatives about his person, reserving the task of printing from them to a more convenient opportunity. He had just time to clear up the last trace of his proceedings before the"], [163, "THE CZAR OF RUSSLA _Si Chief of Police emerged from the foot of the ladder, having sealed up the last sack, and restored every thing to its place overhead. The Chief of Police could only just manage to walk upright, so burdened was he with the perquisites afforded by the secret room. With his assistance the altar was replaced in front of the cavity, and the last symptom of disturbance swept away. The two men then quitted the palace, the Chief moving stiffly away towards his home, while Verriter, who had resumed his monk's habit, returned with the utmost speed to the prison. Here he was at once reconducted to the cell he had left some hours before, where he found Count Halstein fast asleep. That gentleman wakened up quickly enough, however, as the detective condensed into a few hurried sentences the events of the day, and finished by producing the damning evidences of the Czar's instigation and the Bishop's guilt. \" Take these with you,\" he said, handing them to the secretary, who was too much astonished to speak. \" You will be able to print the photographs yourself; it is quite easy ; or if you feel any difficulty about it, keep the plates covered up till I am released. There is no object now in prolonging the arrests. Tell his Highness that he can release the others as soon as he pleases, and myself a few hours after them. If you wish to see me you must take some shares in my antimony mines ; and if necessary I will find a way of smuggling myself into the palace. Be careful not to send away any one who may ask to see you, no matter under what pretext.\" Halstein, who had been exchanging clothes with the detective while listening to these remarks, expressed,"], [164, "i5 2 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. in a few brief words his admiration of Mr. Verriter's achievement. \" I congratulate you especially on having kept the discovery secret from the police themselves,\" he added. \" The Prince does not trust them, and after what you have seen of the Chief to-day, I do not wonder at it.\" The next minute the warder returned, and the Count took his departure, arriving at the palace at the juncture described in a previous chapter. It is now time to remove the scene for a space to the heart of that mighty dominion whose power hung like a dark shadow over the horizon of the Balkiard nation and its Prince. The Czar of Russia lay in Gatschina. Gatschina lay in the midst of a frozen plain of snow. North and south and east and west lay the snow. Spread out over the face of every living thing, like one vast boundless melancholy shroud \u2014 the snow. Stretching away for sightless leagues of desolation, an arctic desert, filled with gloom and haunting dread, it lay. The icy blast of the Pole had gone forth, the leaves had dropped shuddering to the earth, the birds had fled far away to warm themselves in a southern sun, the trees had bowed down their heads beneath their chilly mantle, and the whole land had submitted to a season of death. The very roads were lost beneath the blank waste of snow, the villages lay far apart and cut off from one another by its presence, the lonely houses were beleaguered as by some spectral army. The old people and the children cowered and shivered and made no complaint, but lay themselves down and went to sleep to forget the presence of .the"], [165, "THE CZAR OF EUSSIA. 153 snow. And the strong young men and women shivered and rebelled, and leagued themselves to gether in defiance against the snow; they made sledges, and harnessed them to hot-blooded steeds, and dashed forth in wild career over it ; and some of them made fearful bonfires in the midst of the waste, and danced round them, and drank of fiery, soul maddening liquors, and kept up a fierce strenuous revel amid the snow. Then many lay down and died, and the snow covered them. Others wandered away, and were lost in the white solitude. But whether they were wiser who submitted and slept, or they who struggled and met their doom, the snow lay thick as before ; it seemed as if it would never thaw again, as if the stories which men told of spring in other climates, and in former years, were merely dreams, and would come true never more. AU the way between the city of Petersburg and the great fortress of Gatschina reached the snow. And far on into the interior of ice-bound Russia it spread away, so that Gatschina seemed to be a lonely white monument, a tomb rising up by itself out of the uninhabited white plain. The roofs and walls of Gatschina were white, too, save where a window here and there made a black break in the monotonous outline. Save white and black, there was no other colour to be seen all around. The winter sky behind the mist-girdled sun was black as ink. A few, very few, black specks upon the white expanse of earth marked where the imperial railroad took its course towards the capital. Those few black specks were the windows of huts, erected at regular intervals along the line, and each hut held its half-dozen soldiers, and each soldier kept guard one-third of"], [166, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 154 every day and one-third of every night, watching for the secret enemies of the White Czar. Gatschina towered up from the plain that stretched from Petersburg ; and the armed fortress had just become a royal palace, for thither the potentate, who owned a hundred million slaves, had fled in terror at midnight from the doom which was being hatched for him in the very inmost recesses of his own gorgeous palace in the midst of his own capital. Here, guarded by three thick walls, one within the other, guarded by one thousand picked soldiers of the great Guard, access to him intercepted by signs and passwords and secret signals, cut off by leagues of shelterless waste from every other subject of his power, surely the autocrat might hug himself in safety at last ? Yet, white as are the plains of his huge empire, white as are the walls of his strong palace, white as are the caps of the armed sentinels who crowd its doors and corridors, and cross and recross before its gates, they are scarcely whiter than the cheeks of the man who sits leaning over the fire in the inner cabinet where his Ministers are allowed to interview Iskander III. Of what is he thinking as he sits there ? Does he think of the time when, ignorant of the name of empire, he played as a child along the banks of the Neva ? Does he think of the days when he began to feel pride in his birth and prospects ; or when he first learned that God had called him, and no other man, to the throne of all these realms ? Does he recall the year when he drew his sword against a different oppressor, and marched to do battle with the Turkish power ? Or do. his thoughts"], [167, "THE CZAR OF RUSSIA. 155 turn to the time when a fear he dared not acknowledge took possession of his soul, and he realized that he, he out of all the earth, was the target for the open bullet and the secret bomb ? Does he remember the bitter hour when his father fell in the streets of his own capital, done to death by men who showed no regret nor shame for what they had accomplished, but gloried in it as the discharge of a sacred duty ? \u2014 And then the executions, then the long interminable roll of names, this one for exile, that one for the scaffold, all the victims of his own brief, bloody reign \u2014 do any thoughts of these intermingle with his reflections on the deadly peril which he has just escaped ? And now he suddenly springs up, overturning the chair, and darts towards the door, only pausing as his fingers clutch the handle. A trifling incident has occurred; a piece of coal on the fire has just split with the heat, making a smart report. That is all, but it has been enough to send a shock of awful terror to the heart of the man who owns a sixth part of the earth's surface. Then, seeing that it is no concealed dynamite which has alarmed him, he returns slowly to pick up his chair, muttering as he does so \u2014 \" I will have no more of these fires. I wish I had not given way to Lotta's whims ; the old stoves were far better. But they are dangerous, too ; one cannot tell what may be inside them. I must have all the palaces heated with hot-water pipes ; that is the only safe thing.\" At this moment there came a light tap at the door, which was immediately opened by the giver of the tap. Still unnerved from his fright, the Czar in stinctively thrust his hand into a pocket which"], [168, "156 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. contained a revolver, but withdrew it as quickly on seeing his wife come into the room. Her eyes filled with tears as she noted the move ment, and she said \u2014 \" Oh, Sika ! Has it come to that ! Even here cannot you feel secure ? \" The Czar tried to laugh it off. \" I was only practising readiness,\" he said. And then, seeing the Czarina still uneasy, he tried to turn her thoughts into a different channel. \" General Skouronieff will be here directly with the Report of the Council on Education.\" But the wife's anxiety was not to be so easily diverted. She came and sat down on a chair by his side, and letting her hand rest on his shoulder, asked \u2014 \" Is there no way of putting an end to this terrible state of things ? If you only knew how I think about it night and day ! You never go out of my sight without a secret dread in my mind that you may never come back \" \u2014 she was going to say \" alive,\" but she substituted \u2014 \" safe.\" \" Lotta, Lotta, what is the use of your troubling like this ? \" complained the Czar. \" Were you not warned before our marriage what your life with me would be like ? If you have trials you also have compensations. There are not six women in the world who would not change places with you if they could.\" \"Ah, don't think I regret my choice, dear,\" was the affectionate reply. \" But when these dreadful plots come to light, when we find that our very home is undermined, and we only escape destruction by a few hours, how can I help longing for some way of"], [169, "THE CZAE OF EUSSIA. 157 putting an end to it all ? Look at my sister ; she has to undergo none of these awful anxieties. Why should not you be like the Queen of England, the best-loved person in your dominions, or at all events the object of no man's hatred ? \" \" It is the fate of every man who does his duty without fear, to be hated by the wicked,\" rejoined her husband. \"I would not exchange my position for the mock sovereignty of the Queen. If I could not be Czar, I would rather take the place of a private nobleman, like my friend the Comte de Blois.\" Carlotta sighed. Like a woman, she admired her husband's resoluteness ; but, again like a woman, she trembled for the dangers it induced him to undergo. \" But is there no other alternative ? \" she said gently. \" Would it not be possible to grant some of the things these people are seeking for ? Why should you allow yourself always to be held up as a tyrant ? Would you not be happier if you were engaged in conferring boons on the millions whom you govern, in lifting them up rather than in hold ing them down ? Oh, think of it ! \" \u2014 and a glow suffused her pale cheeks as she spoke \u2014 \"instead of plots and hatreds, gratitude and blessings ! To be able to drive alone, unattended, through the streets of Petersburg, and be cheered and welcomed every where by loving crowds, instead of hearing whispered curses underneath the hired applause and the clank ing weapons of guards ! Oh, Sika, do, for my sake, if not for your own, try to show a little kindness even to the revolutionists ! \" Iskander seemed melted in spite of himself by this appeal. \"I wish I could do what you ask,\" he said. \"But"], [170, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 158 there are only two parties in Russia, the Nihilists and the Imperialists. If I once show any sign of relenting towards the Nihilists, the Imperialists will desert me ; and then, as the Nihilists will continue to distrust me, I shall be isolated, and abandoned to their attempts. No, in this country there is nothing for a monarch to do but to reign like an autocrat, or to resign the throne.\" Here a footstep was heard approaching, by a different way to that by which the Czarina had come. \" Here comes Skouronieff, I expect,\" said the Czar. \"Well, I will see what I can do about the petition you gave me ; and if there are any fresh severities proposed by the Council of Education I will oppose them \u2014 there ! \" His wife thanked him by a light kiss on the fore head, and slipped out of the room by the side door. At the same moment the other door was opened by an Imperial page, who announced \u2014 \"His Excellency General Count Skouronieff.\" \" Come in, General,\" said the Czar, who did not extend his hand. \"Be seated. I suppose you bring the Report?\" \" I do, sire,\" was the reply, as the General availed himself of the permission to take a seat. \" Would your Majesty care to read it, or will it be sufficient if I summarize the recommendations ? \" And he produced a bulky roll of paper. The monarch made no attempt to take it from him, but replied \u2014 \" Proceed, General. I will listen to you first, and look at the report afterwards, if it becomes necessary. I hope, however, that no further repressive measures are considered necessary.\""], [171, "THE CZAB OF RUSSIA 159 Skouronieff knitted his brows. \" I fear your Majesty's goodness of heart will be disappointed. The present restrictions, I am sorry to say, have been found insufficient. The Council proposes several changes. To begin with, we con sider it advisable to abolish the chairs of Classical Literature in the Universities. When we suppressed those of History and those of Modern Literature it was hoped that no avenues for the dissemination of revolutionary doctrines would remain. But it appears that almost all the great works of the Greeks and Romans are so permeated with allusions to republican ideas that they cannot safely be put into the hands of students. One professor has been put under arrest for passing over without condemnation the remarks of Plato on the assassination of Hipparchus by Har modius and Aristogeiton. We therefore recommend that the university course shall henceforth be con fined to the grammars of the classical languages, with a few carefully selected extracts from their literatures, sufficient only to illustrate the difficulties of the subject. By this means we hope to create a distaste for these studies, which will prevent the students from ever desiring to look into such works for themselves.\" \"As long as you merely change the subjects, with out making the discipline more harsh, I do not see that they have much to complain of,\" remarked Iskander, speaking to himself as much as to the General. \" I am honoured by your Majesty's approval. To return to our Report \u2014 the mathematical and scientific courses call for no alteration, but we recommend that the study of chemistry should be rigidly confined to those ingredients which are useful in medicine.\""], [172, "THE PEPNCE OF BALKISTAN. 160 The Czar gave an emphatic nod. \"We have to report that there have been three secret societies among the students discovered during the past year, two of them in the University of Kharkan. We therefore recommend its suppression. Seventy eight students and five professors have been sentenced to terms of confinement, in fortresses and in Siberia, for Nihilism. Fifteen more are now awaiting trial.\" \" I regret to hear of such a large number. It is my wish that the Council make inquiries into some of these cases, with a view to showing leniency where it may be possible.\" The Czar was thinking of his wife's entreaties when he gave this order. Skouronieff hfted his eyebrows in surprise. \"Your Majesty's orders shall be obeyed,\" he answered; \"but, as a general rule, this class of prisoners, on account of then- intelligence, is pecu liarly dangerous, and mercy would be an unsafe policy. To come to the higher schools, we recom mend an entire disuse of the chronicle history at present in use. As your Majesty is aware, its con tents are confined to dates and the barest outlines of events. But our spies have ascertained that the scholars, when they go home, question their parents on various topics referred to in the chronicle, and obtain undesirable information. The distressing fact that the deaths of most of your august predecessors have been brought about by conspirators \u2014 whom may God curse ! \u2014 though carefully concealed in the chronicle itself, appears to be generally known by the scholars. AU study of history had therefore better be discontinued. At the same time, the hours of work must be increased.\""], [173, "THE CZAE OF EUSSIA. 161 Here the monarch again interrupted. \" Surely that cannot be necessary ? If I recoUect rightly, the pupUs are already working nine hours a day. It seems impossible to expect boys of fourteen to do more than that.\" ' ' We have not decided on this recommendation without good reason, sire,\" returned the Minister stubbornly. \"It is imperatively necessary, if our system is to succeed, that the boys should have no opportunity for acquiring pernicious ideas. Now, our agents all over the country inform us of the same thing, namely, that the more inteUigent lads are in the habit of reading and discussing books out of school. These books are not of a kind which the censorship can very weU suppress, but it is far better that the young should not have time to study them. Travels, including descriptions of so-called free countries, are largely read, and so are novels, hke those of the foreign writer Scott, which refer in favourable terms to such things as liberty. Even the Bible is getting to have an alarming circulation among all classes, particularly the poor.\" For answer the Czar pulled open a drawer in his writing-table, and took out a paper. \"Listen to this, Excellency; it was conveyed secretly into the wardrobe of the Czarina.\" And he read it aloud : \u2014 \" Most gracious Majesty, \" The weeping mothers of your empire implore your intervention, as that of a mother, on their behalf. Our children are being torn from us, and immured in the prisons called State schools. There they go through a treadmill round M"], [174, "THE PEFNCE OF BALKISTAN. 162 which dulls their minds and breaks down their health. We see them withering before our eyes, like flowers deprived of sun and air. Last year upwards of seven hundred boys died of fever or congestion of the brain, brought on by this cruel system. Con descend to hear our prayer and save our children, and millions of hearts wiU enshrine your name with worship only second to that paid to the Blessed Mother herself.\" The General shrugged his shoulders. \" The pohce are much to blame for allowing our gracious Czarina to be disturbed with such things,\" he remarked. \" But is it true ? Did seven hundred boys die ? \" \" WeU, sire, of course there will always be some deaths from brain disease in a great empire like Russia. I cannot say how many resulted from over study.\" \" General, I must put a stop to this. The Czarina has been most urgent with me on the subject. What are the hours of work in the primary schools ? \" \" At present eight, but our report recommends that they be raised in some cases to nine.\" \"I will not hear of it. How are the chUdren employed during those hours ? \" \" At present the routine comprises reading, pen manship, orthography, elocution, elementary mathe matics and physics, chronology and geography. But we propose to discontinue the last two subjects for the reasons I have already touched on.\" \" Do you seriously consider that the study of geography tends towards Nihilism ? \" \" Unquestionably, sire. Every kind of knowledge"], [175, "THE CZAE OF EUSSIA. 163 not purely mechanical, every study that deals in political or even moral considerations, has been found to lead directly to Nihilism. Our system, which had the sanction of your Majesty's august father, is based throughout on this consideration. We recognize that there is a large class who are thoroughly loyal, but among the rising generation of the working and middle classes, and even, I am ashamed to say, a small portion of the nobility, there is a spirit abroad which must be crushed at any cost. If we do not conquer it, it will conquer us. The study of the higher branches of knowledge feeds this spirit, and our only safe course is to cut off this study entirely. If our measures are severe, it is because they are measures of war. It is a duel which is being waged, in which your Majesty is one side and your people \u2014 I mean, your rebeUious people \u2014 on the other. Your Majesty sees our position. We seek to render learning repulsive, to give the next generation of Russians an abhorrence for the very covers of a book. Naturally the quickest and most intelligent children are over worked and die. But they are precisely the ones who, if they lived, would turn out our most dangerous enemies, and perhaps take part in conspiracies against the lives of both your Majesties.\" The Minister concluded this speech in a tone of confidence, for he saw his listener was impressed. The autocrat had too recently experienced the power and determination of his foes to wish to add to their ranks. \"It is a hard necessity you force upon me,\" he replied weakly. Count Skouronieff saw his opportunity, and struck a decisive blow."], [176, "164 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. Rising from his chair, he laid the report on the table in front of the Czar, open at the place reserved for the Imperial signature. \" There is the report containing the recommenda tions we have had the honour to submit. Your Majesty will, of course, make what alterations you please, but I am authorized to state on behalf of my colleagues on the Council, as well as myself, that should those alterations take the direction of relaxing its severity, we shall feel compelled to ask your Majesty to relieve us from the burden of duties which we can no longer discharge to your Majesty's satis faction.\" Just as he concluded, the page again tapped at the door. \" Who is there ? \" demanded the Czar. The page entered, and replied \u2014 \" M. Tataroff desires to know if your Majesty will receive him.\""], [177, "165 CHAPTER X. M. TATAROFF. \"M. Tataroff has brought some samples of cigars which he asks leave to submit to your Majesty.\" Thus the page. Iskander III. smiled graciously as he replied \u2014 \" Admit M. Tataroff.\" The thin disguise under which the agent sought an audience was of course a fiction agreed upon between his employer and himself. General Count Skouronieff perhaps knew more about the pretended tobacconist than the Czar had any idea of. At all events, he made no motion of surprise at this uncere monious interruption. The next moment the new comer entered the cabinet. M. Tataroff looked an ideal tobacco merchant. Short, plump, and chubby-cheeked, he bore himself with the air of a prosperous tradesman, who was making a comfortable income without much trouble, and was therefore at peace with the world. No lean and hungry Cassius was this. Clad in a morning suit, whose loose folds seemed to harbour the spirit of ease and jollity, a smile beaming on his red face, and a twinkle flashing in the small and deep-set eyes, he jauntily came through the door and made his obeisance to the Czar. A box of cigars, which he had"], [178, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 166 not taken the trouble to wrap round with paper, was tucked under one arm. His hair was dark and still thick, and his face was almost free from wrinkles. No one, certainly, would have judged him to be more than forty years of age. A close-shaven chin con tained that fold which indicates an appreciation of the good things of life. Sandy side whiskers and moustache completed the outline of a commonplace figure enough, who would have passed in any quarter for what he now represented himself to be. The only additional point which might have revealed itself to a close observer was a slight \u2014 a very slight\u2014 cast in one eye. The Czar received him with a show of cordiality which contrasted with his previous coldness to the Minister. \" Ah, Tataroff,\" he called out in a friendly tone, \"here you are! I have just done with his Excel lency. Tell me, Tataroff, do you think it necessary to keep up this strict repression in the schools and colleges ? \" \"Undoubtedly, sire,\" answered the new-comer, without a moment's hesitation. \" So I should think,\" he hastily added; \"but of course in such a matter my opinion would be guided implicitly by that of the Council on Education.\" \" I suppose you are right,\" said the Czar, with a sigh. Then, taking up a pen, he scrawled the words, \"Approved, Iskander III.,\" on the report, and motioned to the Minister to remove it. That personage at once took his leave, without noticing the tobacco merchant further than by an almost imperceptible smile as he went past him to the door."], [179, "M. TATAEOFF. 167 Iskander made a wry face at the General's de parture, as if their interview had left an unpleasant taste in his mouth. He then turned to M. Tataroff, who had remained respectfully standing, and beckoned him to a chair. \"I have not yet had time to thank you for your services in discovering the mine under my palace,\" he said. \" If your discovery had been delayed another two or three hours I tremble to think what would have happened.\" \" It is nothing.\" The spy assumed a deprecating air. \" I was to blame for not being on the track before.\" \"Have you ascertained the names of all the con spirators yet ? \" questioned Iskander. \" Of all whom I think it desirable to proceed against. Your Majesty knows that it is sometimes necessary to exercise a little discretion. . . . In formation must be paid for. . . . There is a certain man of high military rank who enjoys your Majesty's confidence, and whom I propose to make useful in future by allowing him to remain in the ranks of the society with which I alone know that he is connected. Your Majesty will pardon me for not saying anything more.\" If for a moment it flashed across the Czar's mind that General Skouronieff might be the traitor referred to, he instantly dismissed the idea as wildly im probable. Had not the General shown himself to be more anxious for repressive measures against Nihilism than even his imperial master ? The thing was absurd. \" I am sorry to have to report to your Majesty that things have not gone well in Balkistan,\""], [180, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 168 \"How? What has happened?\" eagerly inquired Iskander. The conversation was taking place on the morrow of the attempted assassination. \"My agent, Simski, has shot at Prince Rodolph and missed him,\" was the reply. \" And now he is in prison, and Monsignor Stefan and Schoffzan are trembling for their safety.\" \"What do you say? Shot! Missed! You do not mean to say that you have been resorting to naked assassination? \" cried the Czar. M. Tataroff 's face wore a resigned expression. \"What else could I do, sire? We could not abduct this man as we did Iskander \u2014 that would have been too barefaced \u2014 and, besides, he is too well guarded. We are trying to organize a rising, it is true ; but the fact is, the creatures won't rise unless they are paid as much per rebel as we give to a lieutenant in Russia. You cannot bribe a whole nation.\" But Iskander was not listening to this explanation. \" What has happened ? \" he demanded with stern ness. \" Tell me all that has transpired.\" \" I know very little myself as yet, sire. The fellow aimed at his Highness as he was driving through the street in a procession, but failed to hit him. He has been arrested, but will confess nothing, and I have made arrangements for a priest under my orders to visit him every day in his cell.\" \" This will go all over Europe. Every one will know that this man is a Russian, and I shall be suspected of employing him. You have no right to resort to such measures without my permission. I am most angry. You have made me a murderer in the eyes of my brother sovereigns.\""], [181, "M. TATAROFF. 169 Thus the monarch. The tobacconist looked sur prised. \"I am sorry,\" he said coolly, \"to find that your Majesty has such scruples. It is the first hint I have had that my measures were not acceptable, and I can assure your Majesty that if Prince Rodolph's hfe had been taken it would have been by no means the first that I have sacrificed for your Majesty's good.\" His little blue eyes did not even glitter, as he made this statement with the air of a father who benevolently explains something to an inquisitive child. His manner exasperated the already wrathful Czar. \" You are presuming on my favour, sir,\" he said angrily. \"You have done a thing calculated to disgrace me in the eyes of the world, and now, instead of apologizing, you boast of other acts of the same kind. Unless you take a different tone I shall find myself obliged to dispense with your services.\" \" Your Majesty alarms yourself unnecessarily. None of the assassinations of which I speak have ever been discovered. Your Majesty's reputation is quite safe.\" The insolence of this reply fairly roused the Czar. Possibly a shrewd observer, familiar with the tortuous methods of the man, might have suspected that M. Tataroff was deliberately aiming at this end. \"You may go, sir. I will not allow it to be said of me that I am the employer of assassins. From this moment you may regard yourself as out of my service.\" M. Tataroff kept his seat and his temper. \"Do you recollect the terms of our arrangement, sire ? \" he asked quietly."], [182, "THE TRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 170 \" That has nothing to do with it. You undertook to secure me from the Nihilists on condition that I allowed you absolute powers. Up to the present I am alive. Good. Now your engagement ceases, and I shall protect myself by other means.\" \" Who informed your Majesty that your dining room floor concealed ten pounds of dynamite ? Who warned you that bombs would be thrown at your carriage from the windows of No. 47 in the Winter Avenue ? \" \" Those are matters of the past. I am safe enough here at all events, and here I will stay rather than submit to your disgraceful methods.\" A cynical smile showed itself on the secret Minister's face. \" Perhaps your Majesty is over-confident. What assurance have you that no one of the troops that guard you is a Nihilist ? \" The Czar started. \" What do you mean, sir? Have you not guaran teed my safety ? Dare you suggest that you have allowed any one to approach me of whom you are not absolutely sure ? \" \" Those are two different questions. As long as our alliance continues \" \u2014 his listener made a con temptuous gesture at this word \u2014 \" I shall not suffer a hair of your Majesty's head to be injured, but should I be dismissed I cannot answer for the con sequences.\" \" Sir, this is a threat which you address to me ! \" cried the despot, his face turning a deep red. \" I will not suffer this to go unpunished. You shall be arrested.\" \"I advise your Majesty to pause before pushing"], [183, "M. TATAEOFF. 171 me to extremities,\" retorted the other. \"Re member that you are dealing with the sole barrier between you and the enemies who seek your destruc tion. Remove me, and your life is not worth three days' purchase.\" He threw a tone of menace into the last words which it was impossible to misunderstand. The Czar drew back in his chair as if he beheld a scorpion. \" What ! Is that your position ? Is the man who pretends to guard me from assassins himself the most dangerous assassin ? I shall expect to hear that you are a Nihilist next.\" Then M. Tataroff rose from his seat and drew himself to his full height. His sunken eyes flashed, his demeanour became almost grand as he flung the following rebuke at his master : \u2014 \" Czar Iskander the Third \u2014 I am a Nihilist ! How else do you dream that I could know of all the plots which are formed against you ? Let me teU you once for aU that you are as much in my hands as your meanest subject is in yours. I play a double part. The police of your empire and the revolution ists are equally in my service. I inspire both. I form one of the Grand Central Executive of the Nihilists, which controls their operations throughout the world, and is in league with all the secret societies in existence. By your authority I wield an absolute power over our own police, and the forces of other countries are in alliance with our own, and serve me for my gold, drawn from your treasury. I am all-powerful. There is no head in the world so lofty that I cannot lay it low. No man has ever quarrelled with me and lived. So long as you leave me to work"], [184, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 172 untrammelled, so long I will preserve your life and add to your dominions. Defy me, and I leave you to the fate of Iskander II. and Frederick III.\" The monarch had quailed at first before this terrible speech. But the closing words stung him into man hood once more. He sprung to his feet in turn, and confronted the mouchard. \" My father ! Frederick ! Monster, had you a hand in their deaths ? \" \"I had,\" exulted the great spy. \"Your father quarrelled with me, as you are trying to do. He dismissed me from the palace one afternoon, and that very night at the meeting of the Executive I organized the plot that took his life. From that hour dates my credit with the Society. The dynamite we used was bought with his own roubles, and I re moved him from my path as you remove Balkiard Princes from yours.\" The Czar had been about to interrupt, but the last scathing allusion stopped the words upon his lips. His tyrant went on \u2014 \"Frederick III. never heard my name. But he was a Liberal. Had he lived he would have be friended the revolutionists, and the triumph of their party in Germany would have meant its triumph here. In that case I should have been lost. Men like me can only flourish under an absolute govern ment. Hence I doomed Frederick. I need not dwell on the means used. We have both women and men in our service. I speak now as a revolutionist, for as the members of that party are fanatics, I employ them, where possible, in preference to mere police spies. I persuaded them that a good monarch was more dangerous than a bad one, on account of his"], [185, "M. TATAEOFF. 173 very virtues reconciling the people to subjection. It is an old argument, and it succeeded again, though death did not result so speedily as it should have done.\" WhUe he thus explained in calm, confident tones the working of his diabolical machinery, Iskander III. felt himself shivering in every fibre with horror. How was he to rescue himself from this man's clutches ? He who had just consigned a thousand children to death with but little concern was ap palled by the fate of a brother monarch. Scarcely yet believing the ghastly revelation, he faltered out \u2014 \" Do you mean \u2014 was the disease of which he died, artificiaUy \" He could say no more. M. Tataroff, thinking the battle was won, dropped easily into his chair again, and replied with an air of good-humoured triumph \u2014 \" Yes, yes. It is not the first time by any means. In fact, I hke that form of doing business best ; but my friends the Nihilists prefer to create a sensation which, they say, strikes terror into the hearts of other tyrants\u2014 meaning, of course, your Majesty. Yes, we searched the hospitals till we found a suffi ciently bad case of the disease in question, and then a very beautiful and devoted member of the Society allowed herself to become the means of convey ing it to the then heir of the German throne. You yourself unconsciously assisted in the plot by giving her credentials at the request of another of my creatures, who occupies a high position in your Court.\" This last brutal declaration was too much to be"], [186, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 174 borne by any one who preserved the least spark of manly feeling. The Czar drew his revolver like lightning, and pointed it at the head of Tataroff. \"Fool!\" shouted the spy, \"you will kill your self!\" \"How?\" said the Czar, pausing for an instant with his finger on the trigger. \" That cigar-box,\" replied Tataroff, pointing to the box which still lay on the table where he had placed it at the beginning of the interview, \"con tains an infernal machine which is wound up and set to go off in three minutes from now. Any shock, such as the report of a pistol, would send it off at once.\" Iskander looked incredulous, but still refrained from firing. \"Put your ear close, and you will hear the ticking,\" continued the other. \" Surely you do not suppose me such a madman as to say what I have said unless I knew myself secure from your vengeance ? \" He arose, coolly stepped to the table and took the box under his arm, the shuddering monarch not daring to move. \" I alone know the way to stop it,\" continued the spy, \" and I shall not do so till you throw away that revolver \u2014 or, stay, give it to me.\" The terrified Iskander obeyed, and Tataroff there upon opened the lid of the box slightly, allowing a faint click-click to be heard, and did something inside it with his finger. During this operation the beads of sweat broke out on his companion's forehead, and he hardly ventured to breathe. \"Now it is safe for another half-hour, unless"], [187, "M. TATAEOFF. 175 something disturbs it,\" remarked the owner of the box, as he replaced it on the table with cold assu rance. \" But let me tell you that this box is merely one of the hundred forms of death which I daily keep suspended over your head. More than a dozen of the inmates of this fortress are sworn to kill you if required. Two of the members of your household are actually charged at this moment with the task of your assassination, and will carry it out unless I previously frustrate their plans, of which I alone know the secret. I knew of the mine beneath the dining-haU in your palace at Petersburg before it was begun. I watched it growing day by day, and finally interfered in such a way as to prove to you my power. Do not dream, therefore, of attacking me, for by so doing you would ensure your own immediate death.\" The speaker paused for a time, and handed the revolver back to the Czar, who took it mechanically. Then he resumed. \" After all, am I not the best servant you have ? All I do is done on your behalf, for, as I have already said, my whole system rests upon despotism. If your Majesty sends thousands of Nihilists every year to death, or the worse than death of the Siberian mines, why draw the line at one man simply because he happens to be a prince ? You asked me to rid you of Iskander, and I did so. Give me a free hand, and I will answer for Rodolph before very long. All I ask is your Majesty's confidence, and in return I undertake that you shall never be compromised. Your Majesty's character for piety and the domestic virtues shall remain untarnished, and insane news paper writers, crude of thought and frothy of language,"], [188, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 176 shall make pilgrimages from the ends of the earth to kiss the carpets over which your Majesty's feet have passed.\" The Czar slowly thawed before this pleading, and as Tataroff's tone grew more respectful, he tried to banish from his mind the hideous secrets of which he had just been made the confidant. The Pohce Minister saw that he had attained his object. Hence forth his master was tamed. \" M. Tataroff,\" said Iskander at last, \" I have long been convinced of the value of your services. Do not make it impossible for me to accept them without losing my self-respect \u2014 that is all I ask.\" M. Tataroff hastened to pour balm upon the wounds he had inflicted. \" I sincerely ask your Majesty's pardon if I have allowed my zeal to carry me away,\" he said, with a low inclination of the head. \" I can only repeat, that my guiding motive in all I do is loyalty to your Majesty's throne and the empire of Russia. I even came here to-day to propose a measure which none of your Ministers of State have thought of, and yet which will, I believe, be of the greatest importance in consolidating your Majesty's rule.\" \"What measure is this?\" asked the Czar, with interest. \"It is this. Thanks to the rapid advances made by your armies during the past two or three decades, your Majesty's Eastern dominions are now almost equal in extent to Russia itself. But owing to their recent annexation, they have not yet grown ac customed to look upon your Majesty in the light of their personal ruler. As you are aware, Samarcand is the ancient capital of that part of Asia. My"], [189, "M. TATAEOFF. 177 suggestion is that your Majesty should proceed in state to Samarcand, and there be crowned Emperor of Tartary. This will attach those wild tribes to your person, and will at the same time furnish a counterblast to the presumption of the English in caUing then sovereign Empress of India.\" Iskander III. was obviously impressed with this proposal. \"I thank you, M. Tataroff,\" he said. \"Your advice is indeed valuable, and I wonder that so admirable and simple a scheme has never suggested itself to any of my Ministers. I will take care to lay it before my Imperial Council at an early date, and unless they raise objections which I cannot now fore see, it shah be carried out without loss of time.\" \" I am rejoiced to hear your Majesty say so,\" rejoined Tataroff. \" I have reason to hope that the moral effect upon the natives of India will be very great. As your Majesty knows, all the successful in vasions of that great empire have come from the direction of Samarcand.\" \"Ha!\" exclaimed the Czar, \"give me India, and I wUl overlook everything.\" \" India shall be yours, sire,\" was the reply. \" Already I am preparing your way there. The rate at which Tchernikow's raUways stretch on towards that peninsula is not more rapid than the growth of hatred for England and English rule which I am fostering secretly among the natives. My secret society, under the cloak of a new religion, has spread its branches everywhere, and has so completely im posed on the English themselves that they openly tolerate it in their own capital. Moreover, I have succeeded in arranging more than one marriage N"], [190, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 178 between women whom I can trust and officers of their army in India, and I am planning others. These women keep me supplied, as far as is in their power, with information relating to military organization and the defence of the frontier. Believe me, sire, the golden fruit for which your Majesty's long line of ancestors have hoped and toiled, is nearly within your grasp.\" In spite of himself, the light of exultation glowed in the monarch's eyes as he listened to this flattering prophecy. But an idea had been suggested to him by one thing in what M. Tataroff had said. \"Speaking of marriages,\" he observed, \"how do you think it would answer to offer a Russian bride to Prince Rodolph ? \" Tataroff looked doubtful. \" An admirable idea, your Majesty, only I fear it is now almost too late. Recent events have probably prejudiced the Prince's mind. Still, that is no reason why an offer should not be made. Possibly he may seize the opportunity of seeking a reconciliation with your Majesty.\" \" I will give orders about it,\" said the Czar, already beginning to forget his recent animosity against this being whom he had so long trusted implicitly. \"The proposal can be made through an unofficial channel.\" \" In the mean time, I hope that your Majesty does not forbid me to continue working on my own lines ? \" persisted the secret agent. Forbid ! the time had ceased, as both of them well knew, when that word could be used by Iskander III. to Ivan Tataroff. \"Do what you think best, M. Tataroff,\" the Czar replied, as graciously as he could. \"Keep from me"], [191, "M. TATAEOFF. 179 the knowledge of your measures when they are such as I could not afford to sanction, and, above all, do not let the hand of the Russian Government be seen too openly.\" Tataroff smiled a thin smile. \" Your Majesty may depend on me for that. Will you please sign these, sire ? \" he added, drawing some papers from his pocket, and laying them before Iskander. \" One is an instruction to the Foreign Minister to make representations to the Balkiard Government on behalf of this wretched bungler, Simski. We cannot afford to desert our instruments, even when they are unfortunate.\" \" How ! What can be alleged on his behalf? \" \" Oh, insanity. I have coUected sufficient evidence to satisfy any impartial person. I even propose to prove that he has escaped from a State asylum. The fact is, he is a religious fanatic. I didn't see why the Jesuits should have a monopoly of assassins. He thinks that he is serving his religion by striking at this schismatic. Your Majesty sees I could not have got a Nihilist to attack an enemy of yours.\" The Czar nodded, and proceeded to affix his sig nature to the various documents before him. M. Tataroff explained their nature one by one, the last being a grant of a pension from the imperial treasury to the wife and children of one Peter Ravuloff. \" Who is this ? \" queried Iskander. \" That is the man we were speaking of. He assumed the name of Simski to prevent identifica tion. Our Balkiard friends, Stefan and Schoffzan, and even M. Nelidoff, only knew him as Simski. I shall cause him to be informed by the priest who goes to confess him that this pension has been"], [192, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 180 secured to his family, and it will encourage him to hold out.\" The monarch looked up astonished. \" You don't mean to say that the Bishop of Sufarest was privy to this plot ? \" Tataroff grinned broadly. \" I wish all my agents were as zealous and as entirely to be relied on as Monsignor Stefan. He thoroughly deserves the reward which your Majesty has promised him in the event of Balkistan becoming part of your dominions. At the present moment I have a scheme on foot \u2014 but I forgot : your Majesty does not wish to be kept informed of my plans ? \" The question thus artfully conveyed caused the Czar to hesitate for a moment between curiosity and pride. The latter feeling triumphed, and he replied \u2014 \" No, tell me nothing except what is necessary.\" And he wrote the imperial autograph upon the document which conferred a reward on the would-be assassin of Prince Rodolph. \" Is there anything else about which you wish to speak to me ? \" \"Nothing, sire. I respectfully ask permission to retire.\" \"Very good. I wish you every success.\" Formal salutations were exchanged, very different in character from the light-hearted greeting with which Iskander had welcomed his visitor half an hour before ; and the organizer of the \" White Terror \" withdrew, leaving the master of more than half a continent to reflections which his most wretched prisoner would hardly have envied. The next news that reached him, a week or so"], [193, "M. TATAROFF. 181 later, was that the leaders of his party in Sufarest were in prison, on an accusation of treasonable con spiracy. The energetic efforts made by the Russian Government for then- release have already been related."], [194, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 182 CHAPTER XL THE STRUGGLE BEGINS. When Ezekiel P. Baxter was released from his second confinement, at the time fixed by himself, his first step was to ascertain what impression his arrest had made upon the friends of the Czar in Sufarest. With this view, as soon as he had re-established himself in his apartments, he ordered a carriage, and drove once more to the Bishop's palace. The hopes he had founded on his arrest were destined to be realized. The others had come to the conclusion that Mr. Baxter must be an emissary of Tataroff's, and not of Prince Rodolph's, and their reception of him was cordial in the extreme. He found the Bishop in consultation with MM. Schoffzan and Nelidoff in the same room in which the prelate had been arrested. The American's entrance was the signal for various friendly exclama tions, and the Metropolitan rose and extended his hand, saying \u2014 \" Welcome, M. Baxter. I am glad to find that they have released you as well. No doubt you have heard of their treatment of M. Schoffzan and myself ? \" \" I have. I own I was astonished when I heard"], [195, "THE STEUGGLE BEGINS. 183 that they had presumed to constrain your Grace, and even to take possession of this palace. M. Schoffzan, too \u2014 I am told that they had the audacity to burn down his house.\" \"I don't know whether they really did it on purpose,\" remarked that gentleman, \" but I mean to accuse them of it. I have sent telegrams to that effect already to our various organs.\" It should be understood that M. Schoffzan dis charged the duties of Sufarest correspondent to the various newspapers, one of which in every great capital is either openly or secretly in the pay of the Russian Czar. \" Quite right,\" commented Mr. Baxter. Then he added carelessly, \"I suppose none of you have any idea why I was included in the arrests ? \" The other three smiled at one another. \"Surely the reason is very plain,\" rephed the Bishop. \"You were a recent arrival, your objects in coming here were of a character which might easily veil some intrigue. You came from America in the first place, it is true, but it was known that you had passed through Petersburg, and they naturally suspected you of being the medium of the correspondence.\" \" What ! Have they discovered any correspon dence ? \" cried the financier, with an expression of consternation. \"No, no,\" replied Stefan; \"re-assure yourself, my dear sir; they have discovered nothing. They searched this building thoroughly, and penetrated, as I have reason to suspect, into its most secret recesses ; but their search, regarded as a search for documents, has completely failed.\""], [196, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 184 And the prelate gave a self-satisfied smile which afforded inward gratification to his hearer. \"Yes,\" added Nelidoff, \" and they actually brought a detective all the way from Vienna to help them. So one of my agents in the police-office informs me.\" It was evident that they were now thoroughly convinced of Mr. Baxter's good intentions, when so barefaced an allusion was made in his presence. He put on as fierce a look as he could assume, and said \u2014 \" That is all very well ; but what about revenge ? I do not intend to be treated like this without making any return. We are not accustomed to that style of doing things in America.\" Meaning looks were exchanged between the three conspirators. The Consul-General was the one to answer. \" Probably before very long you may have the opportunity you want. A httle money judiciously spent by you might help on the cause a good deal. The people, it is true, are difficult to rouse, but there are the refugees, and they may be expected to make a move.\" \" But they are not very numerous, are they ? They will want some help from outside.\" ' ' I think they will get whatever help they do want.\" With this significant reply, the Consul closed the discussion. After a brief time spent in conversation on other subjects, including that of antimony and the prospect of finding it in paying quantities on Monsignor Stefan's estate, the American rose to go."], [197, "THE STRUGGLE BEGINS. 185 As he did so M. Nelidoff also got on his feet, remarking \u2014 \" Perhaps, M. Baxter, you wUl allow me to share your carriage as far as the St. Stefan hotel. I did not bring my own.\" Mr. Baxter acquiesced with great readiness, and the two took their departure together, leaving the suspicious Schoffzan and the Bishop to torture themselves with anxiety as to what secret communi cation M. Nelidoff had to make to the financier behind their backs. Whatever the conversation in the carriage was about, it appeared to have afforded a good deal of quiet amusement to the detective, judging from the expression of his face as he walked into his hotel after parting with M. Nelidoff on the pavement. The Consul's last words were \u2014 \" You can gain access to him easily enough. In the absence of a Consul representing the United States in Sufarest, you, as an American citizen, are entitled to demand an explanation of your arrest.\" As a result of this exhortation, Mr. Baxter emerged from his apartment shortly afterwards, clad in a coat whose gleam was of more than usual splendour, and directed his way to the palace of Prince Rodolph. He arrived there at an opportune moment. At the very time that he was being taken into the con fidence of the Russian Consul, a secret consultation had been proceeding in the Prince's cabinet, the parties to which were himself, his mother, and the private secretary. Several copies had by this time been printed of the photographs taken by Mr. Verriter, and these lay upon a table in front of the three debaters. The"], [198, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 186 debate, it need scarcely be said, turned on the use to which these proofs could be put. Count Halstein was for diplomatic action. \"That is the only course worthy of you, sir,\" he said to Rodolph. \" We now have ample proof, proof sufficient to convince every honest mind, that the Czar is a hirer of assassins. Let us lay these proofs before the cabinets of the Great Powers \u2014 England, France, Germany, Austria, and Italy. In common manhood they will be obliged to take the matter up, and put a stop to this odious warfare.\" \" I wish I could feel as sure of it as you do,\" was the Prince's answer. \" My opinion of the Great Powers of Europe is that the time has gone by for them to take up any cause except where their own profit is immediately concerned.\" \"But what excuse could they make?\" persisted the Secretary. \" What could they say to these photographs ? \" \" Oh, they could pretend to believe them forgeries.\" As soon as the word had slipped out of the Prince's mouth, he bit his lip, and avoided looking in his mother's direction. But the Princess Claudine was far too strong-minded a woman to feel sensitive about such a trifle. \" The Czar would say that in any case,\" she observed calmly, \" and no doubt he would try and confirm his assertion by referring to the unfortunate Bismarck correspondence. But my son is quite right. The Powers would not be influenced in such a matter by their belief or disbelief in these photographs. Their own interest is all they will look at. Clearly the first Power to apply to, the one most interested in checking the power of Russia, is England. Why"], [199, "THE STRUGGLE BEGINS. 187 not let Count Halstein go there on your behalf, and see whether anything can be done ? \" Rodolph remained plunged in meditation for some time. Then he slowly answered \u2014 \" No, you are mistaken. The Power most adverse to the Czar, the Power most likely to come to our assistance, is not England.\" \" Do you mean Germany ? \" demanded the Princess, in some surprise. \" No. I mean the only Power that the Czar really fears. I mean the NihUists ! \" Claudine drew back in horror. \"My son! what are you saying? I trust you do not dream for a moment of allying yourself with revolutionists. What would my brother, the Comte de Blois, say, if he could hear you ! \" For answer, Rodolph rose to his feet, and after pacing the room once or twice, took his stand in front of the other two, with a flush upon his face. \"It has come to this, that I do not care what weapons I use, so long as I crush these cowardly attempts on my hfe. If the Czar resorts to secret methods against me, I will resort to them against him. If he employs assassins, I will employ them. It shah be the same for him as it is for me. I will not admit \" \u2014 he stamped his foot fiercely upon the ground \u2014 \" I wiU not admit that this spiteful ruffian, merely because he happens to be an emperor, is entitled to murder me, whUe I, because I only happen to be a prince, am not entitled to kUl him.\" The Princess looked horrified at this outburst. \"My dear Rodolph, I implore you not to talk so wUdly,\" she exclaimed. \"You cannot really mean what you say, and it shocks me inexpressibly."], [200, "188 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. Remember what is due to your uncle the Comte de Blois, who is on friendly terms with the Czar.\" \" Curse the Comte de Blois ! \" The Princess had invoked the name of that venerable relative once too often. Accustomed all her life to look with superstitious reverence on the royal claimant, and to consider that the affairs of the whole world centred round the question of how he was to obtain the throne of his ancestor, it had never dawned upon her that Rodolph could set up his own interests in opposition to those of his House, or con sider his own occupation of the Balkiard throne as anything more than a move in the great game being played on behalf of the Comte de Blois. Rodolph proceeded to overwhelm her. \"I am not here to serve the ends of my uncle. The Balkiard people have called upon me to rule over them, and to safeguard then country from the encroaching tyranny of Russia. I have sworn to do so. I have sworn to forget my own country and my own friends, and to become the Prince of Balkistan alone. That oath I will keep. The people who trust me shall not be deceived. If my uncle is the friend of Iskander, so much the worse for him. He is the friend of a villain. I owe no respect to the Count, except as the head of my family, and if I find it necessary to pursue a certain course in my interests, and in those of Balkistan, I should be a fool and a traitor if I stooped to consult his wishes or to ask his leave.\" Claudine was thunderstruck. Never had she suspected her son of such force of character. Under the stress of persecution and conflict, Rodolph was developing quite new qualities. Being a woman, al"], [201, "THE STRUGGLE BEGINS. 189 her sympathies were aroused by this display of manli ness, and as a mother she could not help feeling pride in the pride of her 6on. Still, it was a wrench to be asked to abandon her lifelong devotion to her brother. Before she could reduce her conflicting emotions to order, the con ference was disturbed by the arrival of Mr. Verriter. Mr. Verriter came announced as Ezekiel P. Baxter, and the page who brought his name to the Prince was secretly surprised, in so far as a royal servant is capable of being surprised, at the readiness with which admission was granted to one so recently released from prison. The detective wore a quiet smile on his face as he entered the room, and paid his respects to Prince Rodolph, who presented him to Claudine. As soon as the first disturbance of his entrance had subsided, and he had received the gracefully worded thanks of the Prince for his important services, Mr. Verriter remarked \u2014 \" I venture to think that your Highness would not easily guess the capacity in which I come here.\" \" What do you mean ? \" questioned Rodolph. \" Is this some new disguise, more ingenious than the last ?\" \" It is not that, sir. The fact is that I have come here in a semi-official character. I am here as the emissary of the Czar of Russia.\" Exclamations of incredulity broke from his three hearers. \" Is this some joke ? \" said the Prince. \" Not at all, your Highness. Or at least, we have the joke to ourselves. The Russian Consul-General has solemnly constituted me the bearer of a proposal from the Czar himself.\""], [202, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 190 \" You must really explain.\" \" M. Nelidoff, whom I met at the Bishop's, drove away with me in my carriage. During our ride he explained to me that he had received instructions to sound your Highness privately as to whether you would be prepared to enter into a species of recon ciliation with the Czar, on certain conditions. M. Nelidoff seemed to think that you would not be willing to receive him personally \" \" He was quite right ! \" \" And therefore he asked me to become his agent in the matter.\" The Prince and his mother gazed at each other in doubt and surprise. Count Halstein, who as usual had been an attentive listener of all that went forward, now put in a word \u2014 \" This proposition conceals some trap. Did Nelidoff say what the conditions were ? \" \" The principal one was that his Highness should take a Russian wife, to be selected for him by the Czar from among the higher nobility.\"J Rodolph started, and stole a conscious glance in his mother's direction at the first part of this answer. At the last words he frowned angrily, and retorted \u2014 \"M. Nelidoff had better tell his master that the royal house of France is not in the habit of forming alliances among the ' higher nobility.' He had better also tell him that my ancestors were European kings when the Czar's family were a horde of wandering savages.\" He spoke in a burst of temper. His friend Count Halstein took the liberty of a mild correction \u2014 \" Would it not be better, sir, if Mr. Verriter took back this reply \u2014 that your Highness has too keen a"], [203, "THE STRUGGLE BEGINS. 191 sense of the patriotism of the ladies of Russia, as shown by the state into which a neighbouring kingdom has been plunged, to hope to find among them a suitable queen for the Balkiards ? \" But Princess Claudine's advice was the best. \" Let the Czar be told that the Prince of Balkistan is about to be betrothed to his cousin, her Royal Highness the Princess Mathilde, who was a short time ago the Czar's fellow-guest at Copenhagen.\" The Prince cast an earnest look at his mother, as if to say, \"Can you answer tfor this?\" Receiving a slight nod in reply, he turned to Mr. Verriter and said \u2014 \" The Princess is right. That is my answer.\" Verriter bowed. \" May I ask if your Highness has formed any plans as to the future ? \" he said, pointing to the photo graphs on the table, of which at the same time he slipped copies into his own pocket, with a view to future contingencies. \" That is the very subject we were discussing when you came. It has been suggested that Count Halstein should go to England with the evidence you have obtained for us, and try to secure the intervention of your Government to restrain Russia from her designs on Balkistan. Do you think there is any likelihood of success ? \" Mr. Verriter modestly shook his head. \"I have never given my mind to politics, your Highness, except where they have come into my professional work. I know that our late Prime Minister was supposed to be hostile to Russia, and that our present one is regarded as a friend of hers, but that is about all I can say.\""], [204, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 192 \"Let me go and make the attempt, at all events,\" said Halstein. \"If I fail, we shall be no worse off than we were before.\" \" The only other course that I see,\" pursued Rodolph, \" is to seek the aid of the Czar's enemies, the Nihilists.\" Here Claudine rose to her feet. \" You know my sentiments on that point, Rodolph. I have no right to dictate to you, I am well aware, but if you are going to seriously discuss taking those creatures into your confidence I would rather not be present.\" Prince Rodolph rose, and respectfully opened the door for his mother to pass out. With a gracious bow to Verriter, and a friendly one to Halstein, she disappeared. The three men drew their chairs closer together. \" There is one thing I ought to teU your Highness,\" said the detective. \" I believe there is further mis chief brewing. The project of a military insurrec tion has by no means been abandoned, and I fear there may be even a fresh attempt in the nature of Simski's.\" \" And I am to give them the chance ! \" cried Rodolph. \" I am to sit still and refuse to retaliate, while they go on preparing fresh plots. I am to allow them to go on shooting at me till they do hit me!\" \"As your Highness has seen, the more incrimi nating of those two letters is signed ' Ivan Tataroff.'

He is, in short, the Bismarck of underground Europe. Now, such a man as that is not likely to leave his work half done. Unless restrained by the positive commands of the Czar, he wUl find some other instrument with which to aim at your life.\" \" I have been anticipating something of that kind,\" said the Prince, looking slightly troubled. \" But, I see you have something more to say.\" \"It is simply this. At the present moment Sufarest is a dangerous place for your Highness to be in. If you remain here much longer, I will not answer for your safety. You have just struck a blow which has had the unavoidable effect of letting your foes see that they are suspected. They will never rest now, if they are wise in their own interests, till either you or they have faUen. To come to the point, I want your Highness to go away for a time on a visit, leaving me here to watch the progress of events, and to detect any new indications of M.

What could be more natural than that you should pay a visit to the Princess MathUde ? \" \" Well, I wiU consider your advice.

The Empress of England is without political influence.\" \" Is that really so ? \" \" Absolutely.\" \"It is unfortunate, because I was relying some what on her interest. Prince Iskander's brother, you know \" \" I understand, your Highness. But an appeal to the Empress would be quite useless. The Count must see the head of the Cabinet. He is the only monarch of England.\" \" That is settled, then. Halstein, you will know how to proceed. And if your errand proves fruit less, then the next journey must be that of M. Verriter, to the headquarters of the Nihilists.\" \" Not forgetting your Highness's own expedition to the Castle of ,\" added the detective, as he rose to go. \"I entreat your Highness not to treat my anxiety for your safety as idle. In my opinion the peril is a very real one.\" The discussion terminated, and two days afterwards Count Halstein found himself rapidly approaching the world-renowned capital of London, charged with Prince Rodolph's mission. About the same time a quiet, respectably-dressed stranger, who might have passed very well for a"], [207, "THE STEUGGLE BEGINS. 195 confidential clerk or a traveller in drugs or jewellery, alighted at the Sufarest terminus of the northern line, and ordered the driver of a droshky, or open chariot, to convey him to the episcopal palace. The traveller, whose sole luggage consisted of a large portmanteau, alighted at the palace, paid off the droshky, walked up the steps, and knocked con fidently at the door. As soon as it was opened he demanded to be instantly admitted to the presence of Monsignor Stefan. \" What name shall I announce ? \" asked the servant. \" None. His Grace is impatiently expecting me. Carry up my portmanteau at the same time.\" Overwhelmed by the visitor's superb assurance, the menial obeyed. The new arrival trod closely upon his steps, they arrived at the door of Monsignor Stefan's library together, and the moment the foot man had turned the handle the stranger quietly thrust him aside and advanced alone into the room, closing the door behind him in the face of the dis comfited servant. The Metropolitan, who was alone, rose up in astonishment at this intrusion. But with his entrance into the Bishop's presence, a complete change had taken place in the manner of the visitor. It was with a deferential, almost a cringing air, that he approached the prelate, taking a letter from his breast at the same time. \" I entreat your Grace's pardon for coming before you so abruptly, but my instructions to present myself to you immediately and alone are my excuse. This letter will explain.\""], [208, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 196 Stefan took the missive, and turned pale as he read the superscription. That handwriting was known to him by heart. The letter ran \u2014 \" Monsignor, \" I send you the bearer, Paul Melovitch, to assist you and the rest of our friends in the good work you have in hand. Receive him, I beg of you, in the character of your private secretary, and trust him as you would myself. \"Respectfully, \" Ivan Tataroff.\" The prelate read these lines with a bitter smUe, which he tried to soften away when he looked up and caught the eyes of Paul Melovitch fixed upon him. The Metropolitan was a man of some resource, a not unworthy coadjutor of the great Russian plotter himself. His reflections while reading the note had been \u2014 \" Tataroff suspects me. This man has come here as a spy. His suspicions have been roused by Simski's faUure, and he has sent this agent to organize a fresh attempt, in which I shaU run the greatest danger if I admit this man to my house hold.\" His spoken commentary, addressed to the bearer of the note, was \u2014 \" M. Tataroff is very good. We shall be delighted to have your aid, though I fear it will be impossible for me, just at present, to put you in the situation he points out. Later on I may manage it. Won't you take a seat?\""], [209, "THE STRUGGLE BEGINS. 197 \" I would rather go upstairs first. The servant is on the landing outside, with my luggage.\" \"But, my good fellow,\" the prelate tried to explain with a pleasant smile, \"I was telling you that I'm afraid I can't manage to receive you just at present. I cannot get rid of my present secretary without notice, and, moreover, I have reason to believe that the palace is closely watched, and that any new inmate would excite suspicion directly.\" The visitor did not appear to be in the least put out by these reasonings. He listened to the Bishop quietly, and at the end replied simply \u2014 \" M. Tataroff's instructions to me were imperative. I dare not leave this palace unless you thrust me out by force.\" \" What nonsense, my dear M. Melovitch ! \" cried Stefan, forcing a nervous laugh. \"You talk as if M. Tataroff were an ogre, who held everybody at his mercy. However, if you make such a point of it, I suppose I must try to accommodate you till you have time to make fresh representations to him. I will inform the household that you are here on a visit.\" \" No. I am here as your Grace's secretary.\" Stefan gave a frown. This persistence alarmed him more than he cared to confess even to himself. Suddenly he bethought him of a weapon which he had seldom known to fail with men of the class before him. He went to a strong-box in the wall of the apart ment, and took out a sum equivalent to about \u00a3800 English money. \" M. Melovitch, if I cannot at once give you the appointment you ask, at all events you shall see that it is not because I grudge you the salary."], [210, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 198 Accept this first instalment as a mark of my esteem, and make the best excuse you can to M. Tataroff.\" The Russian's face changed at the sight of the money. A greedy look came into his eyes, and, as his fingers closed over the notes, he said, in a very different tone \u2014 \"Your Grace may rely on my serving you to the utmost possible extent. But I know M. Tataroff well. If we do not carry out the arrangements proposed by him, there will be a terrible row \u2014 he may come down here himself.\" \" God forbid ! \" piously ejaculated the Bishop. The spy chuckled. \" Therefore your Grace had better let me remain in the palace for the present, calling me what you please, and I will undertake to keep M. Tataroff in good humour, and execute any other commands your Grace may have for me.\" \"Agreed, M. Melovitch. Then I will call in the servant and tell him you are staying here as \u2014 my guest.\" The other acquiesced, and was presently on his way upstairs to a sleeping-room. Left to himself, Monsignor Stefan took out his handkerchief to wipe the perspiration from his fore head. \" I have drawn his teeth,\" he muttered, \" but Heaven knows what will come next.\" Perhaps, if the Metropolitan could have seen the face of M. Tataroff's agent, when he found himself alone, he would have been even more uneasy than he was."], [211, "199 CHAPTER XII. THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. Count Halsteln reached England at an unfortunate moment for the success of his mission. The attention of both statesmen and people in that kingdom was for the time being whoUy absorbed by an internal question of great difficulty and importance. The two great parties in the State were sharply divided on the matter, and the press on both sides teemed with articles whose language sufficiently showed how grave a crisis had arisen in the history of the country. The difficulty which was now shaking the empire to its centre had arisen, as usual, in the outlying region of Ireland. Friction had for some time pre vailed between the owners of the soU in that region, and its immediate cultivators, and the sore feeling had culminated some time before, on one estate, in an outbreak of a rather remarkable kind. A whole body of tenantry, numbering some hundreds of persons, had marked their sense of their landlord's misconduct by migrating in a body, and leaving his estate on his hands. So far aU might have been well, but after their voluntary exile had lasted a certain time, the tenants in question showed a disposition to return to their former homes. This step the landlord was now"], [212, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 200 strongly determined to resist, the more so as his enemies, having exhausted their funds in hostilities, had nothing left to offer in the shape of rent. Had there been nothing more in the situation, the Government of a great country like England might have been able to grapple with it without too much strain on its resources. But for reasons not easily understood by a foreigner like the Count, though palpable at once to an intelligent student of English history, the present welfare and future existence of that empire appeared to depend on the terms on which the difference between these particular peasants and their landlord were to be adjusted. Each Bide had powerful friends in the imperial legislature, and no less strenuous advocates in the press. From a perusal of the speeches of the leading politicians, and the criticisms in the principal newspapers, it appeared that the struggle involved consequences more tremendous than the most ingenious mind could have foreseen. On the one hand, the crushing of the obnoxious landlord was shown to be an indispensable step towards securing the liberty and happiness of aU the peoples subject to the English crown ; on the other hand, it was demonstrated that the triumph of the rebellious tenants would be the signal for the immediate break-up of the empire, and the overthrow of the Protestant religion all over the world. The party which happened to be in office at the time having warmly espoused the cause of the tenants, a measure for their relief had been introduced into the Legislature, and carried through the Lower House, after a bitter and protracted resistance, extending over a large part of the session. But though the"], [213, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 201 Government had so far succeeded, by the brute force of then majority, their overbearing conduct had only served to embitter the strife, and to stimulate the Opposition to put forth their utmost strength in the Upper Chamber. In that House the friends of the landlord were in an overwhelming majority ; the unfortunate BUI was therefore riddled with hostile amendments and sent back, a torn and mangled wreck, to the House of its patrons, It was now that the full gravity of the situation became apparent. Popular passion, roused to a high pitch by this war fare between the aristocratic and democratic assem blies, threatened to boil over, and the whole country rocked and swayed as though on the eve of a revolution. The head of the Government at this time was a man of immense intellectual resources, and of an energy that could only be called colossal. But even his great mind, exercised night and day by these constitutional tumults, had little room for the con sideration of foreign affairs not of the most pressing character. However, the credentials of Count Hal stein were of such a nature that he could not be refused an audience, and consequently, on the day after his arrival, in the evening, he found himself in the presence of the great Minister. He saw before him the venerable form of a man whose singular vigour of constitution, aided by a life of extreme regularity, had enabled him to retain the complete possession of his wonderful faculties at a period when most men are beginning to sink in senile decay. With a courtly grace which seemed hke a reminiscence of the earlier half of the century, the aged statesman offered his visitor a seat, and"], [214, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 202 commenced a polite inquiry after the health of the Prince of Balkistan. Disposing of these ceremonial preliminaries as briefly as good manners would allow, Count Halstein hastened to the point. \" I have come here to ask your Excellency \" The great man stopped him with a gesture of the hand. \"You must not call me 'Excellency,' sir. I have no such title. Call me plain Mr. Dalston.\" Halstein bowed, much impressed, and apologized before resuming his address. \" I have come to lay before you, on behalf of Prince Rodolph, certain information as to the rela tions between Russia and Balkistan.\" The Premier knitted his brows. \" Proceed, sir.\" \" You have of course heard of the attempt on the Prince's life a week or two back, by a man who gave his name as Simski ? \" \" I have. I have been assured on good authority that the man is a lunatic, and that the proper way to dispose of the affair would be to send him back to the asylum from which he escaped.\" Halstein curled his lip scornfully. \" That information has no doubt reached you from a Russian source. You will no doubt be unprepared to learn that this very man is an agent in the employ of the Russian police, who came to Sufarest with a letter commending him to the Czar's friends there, and signed by the head of the Petersburg force.\" \"Impossible ! You must be trifling with me, sir.\" \" Here is a photograph of the letter.\" The English Minister drew back in agitation as"], [215, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 203 Count Halstein produced the photograph of Tataroff' s letter, and offered it for his acceptance. \" What is this, sir ? How did you come by it ? \" For answer Count Halstein narrated as briefly as possible the whole of the circumstances. The Prime Minister was visibly shaken. He took the photograph, and turned it over and over in his hand. \"What do I know about this Ivan Tataroff?\" he said at length. \" How do I know that he has any authority whatever from the Russian Government ? \" \"Read this, sir. It was found in the same re ceptacle as the other.\" He handed him the second letter. The Englishman started. \"This is Iskander III.'s writing!\" he exclaimed involuntarily; then correcting himself, he added \u2014 \" or at least it is a very good imitation.\" Halstein's face fell. He began to fear that the Minister had heard of the Copenhagen intrigue, and that Princess Claudine's fears were destined to prove correct. He watched Mr. Dalston reading it carefully through, and then remarked \u2014 \" The original is still in the possession of Mon signor Stefan, and I have no doubt we can lay our hands on it at any moment.\" \"I do not doubt it,\" was the reply. \"But you will pardon my remarking that it is possible for both the Bishop and you to have been deceived by a forgery. In any case, supposing these documents to be genuine, what do they prove ? \u2014 that Monsignor Stefan is regarded favourably by the Czar of Russia, and that an individual, of whom I personally have"], [216, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 204 never heard, rejoicing in the name of Tataroff, con siders that he is serving the Czar by sending this wretch to Sufarest. No proof that he expected a murder to follow; no proof that the Czar has ever heard a syUable about the plot, if plot there were.\" \" Oh, sir,\" protested Halstein, \" I reveal to you a dark and odious conspiracy, I lay the evidences of it before your eyes, and you speak of absence of proofs. Can it be that you entertain any doubt of the Czar's guUt ? \" \" Pardon me, my dear sir, that is not the question. For my private opinions, as an individual, I alone am responsible. But you have come to me, I take it, as the representative of England, the Minister charged with the destinies of this great country. Were I in a position involving a greater amount of freedom and a smaller amount of responsibility, I might feel less difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to the course which I ought to pursue ; but when I am asked to enter upon an enterprise, the issues of which may affect the honour and safety of this country, I feel bound to pause and take time for consideration.\" Count Halstein felt a sick, hopeless feeling creep over his heart, and almost wished his journey had never been undertaken. Yet it was impossible to quarrel with the admirable reasoning of the Minister. \" What is it you ask ? \" continued the other, his eloquence expanding as he went along. \"Does Prince Rodolph seek for our diplomatic intervention ? On what pretext can we grant it? How can we possibly address a remonstrance to an independent sovereign on the course of conduct pursued by certain secret agents, in a different country ? He would"], [217, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 205 resent our interference, and refuse to notice your charges. Even if he did not take that attitude, he would simply disown this Tataroff, and the affair would be at an end. You would be simply where you were before.\" \" Are there no means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Czar ? The public opinion of Europe \" The Prime Minister interrupted. \" There are three courses open,\" he said, \" always assuming the accuracy of your story and of the con clusions you would have me draw from it. The first I have already described. The second is combined international action in the form of a Congress. But how can Prince Rodolph ask for that ? In the eye of international law he is a mere trespasser, his election is invahd under the provisions of the Berlin Treaty. The first thing such a Congress would do would be to order him to vacate the throne, and to require the Balkiards to select some other Prince. The third alternative is war.\" He pronounced the word in such a tone as to indicate that he considered the discussion was at an end. But Halstein was not yet prepared to give up. \" And why not, sir ? \" he responded with warmth. \" England will have to go to war with Russia some day, if she means to keep possession of her Indian empire, and why not now ? Why not draw the sword in the cause of justice, of oppressed nationalities, the cause with which your own great fame is indissolubly bound up ! \" The aged statesman smiled mournfully, and shook his head. \" You are a young man, and perhaps you hardly"], [218, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 206 realize the awfulness of the thing which you are asking. I have had some experience, in my political career, of what war means.\" At this moment the speaker was interrupted. There was a hasty knock at the door, and a gentle man in irreproachable dress, and with an air of the most intense importance, like one who was conscious that he bore the burden of the whole world upon his shoulders, and was determined that no one should relieve him of his task, burst into the room. \" Ah ! \" he exclaimed, catching sight of the Premier, and not noticing the presence of his com panion, \"thank Heaven, I have found you! We have just disagreed with the amendment of the Upper House, providing for the payment of the arrears of rent in full out of the Imperial Exchequer, before the readmission of the tenants to their hold ings ; and now the Leader of the Opposition has moved that the constabulary be employed to cultivate the land pending a peaceful settlement of the dis pute by arbitration, and some of our men are in favour of the suggestion. You must eome down to the House at once.\" \" You see,\" said the Premier to Count Halstein, as he rose from his chair, \" I am overwhelmed with business of the gravest moment. Some other time, when I am less urgently occupied, I shall hope to have the pleasure of renewing our interesting con versation. Convey, I beg of you, the assurance of my most respectful sympathy and consideration to your master.\" Count Halstein got up, with bitterness in his heart. \"Does your Excellency desire to keep these ?\" he asked, pointing to the photographs."], [219, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 207 \" No, no,\" returned the other hastily. \" I would rather not; I see no purpose to be gained by doing so.\" The answer struck the knell of any lingering hope in Halstein's breast. He bowed respectfully, took up the papers, and quitted the room without another word. Within three hours he was on his way back to Balkistan. While this vain attempt was being made to secure foreign assistance against the Czar, affairs were not standing stUl in Sufarest. Monsignor Stefan, after he had broken the ice with the bribe of \u00a3800, found that he got on pleasantly enough with the new inmate of his household. Paul Melovitch, if that were his name, proved to be a man of the world, possessed of a fund of varied anecdote, and a most refreshing flow of spirits. He soon soothed the Bishop into good humour, and next begged for an introduction to some of the leaders of the Russian faction. He stipulated, however, for the strictest secrecy as to his real character and position. Under the guise of a friendly sympathizer he soon became intimate with the suspicious Schoffzan, and developed into a regular customer of the St. Stefan cafe. He was less successful in winning the confidence of M. Nelidoff. That gentleman, knowing that the failure of the Simski plot must have involved him in some share of disgrace, had retired into his shell, and was determined to have nothing to do with any new hands unless they presented the most convincing credentials from headquarters. The new-comer had also scraped a casual acquaint ance with Mr. Baxter, but as professional instinct led"], [220, "208 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. each to wish to see the other show his hand first, what little conversation they had together turned chiefly upon tho weather and tho price of wines. After a few days of this quiet sort of bohaviour, M. Melovitch ono morning prosentod himsolf in tho Bishop's library with a small parcel in his right hand. There was a frown upon his brow, and his lips were tightly compressed, as if in preparation for a struggle. \" Do you know the rumour which is going about ? \" he demanded abruptly. \" No,\" said Stefan, looking up norvously. \" It is stated everywhere this morning that Prince Rodolph is going to marry his cousin, and will shortly set off on a visit to her father's castle. It is intoler able. If we once allow these people to breed,\" he added coarsely, \" it is all over.\" Stefan was stupefied at this new tone on the part of M. Tataroff's emissary, and equally so at tho news. \" What do you propose to do ? \" he asked. \" This simply makes it necessary to hasten our operations. I should have boen glad to give you longer, but in face of this wo must act at once. Princo Rodolph must not leave Sufarest alive.\" The Bishop trembled. \" What do you propose to do ? \" \" I will explain.\" The spy sat down, and undoing the parcel in his hand, producod a brooch, exactly similar in appear ance to the one worn by Stofan to mark his episcopal rank. It was a specimen of tho same class of orna ment, the pattern of which is quite peculiar, which had been carried off by Mr. Verriter from his explo ration of the episcopal treasure hoard."], [221, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 209 \" You have probably heard of the celebrated Tebaldi Key ? \" said the spy, as he exhibited this object to the astonished gaze of the Metropolitan. \"No.\" \" Well, the Tebaldi Key, which is preserved in the Arsenal of Venice, is an iron machine, shaped like an ordinary large key, which contains an extremely powerful spring, by means of which small steel needles, about one inch in length, are projected with amazing force. The key was constructed by a man named Tebaldi in the sixteenth century, the golden age of assassination, and by its aid he killed three persons before being discovered. His plan was to discharge the needle so as to lodge in some vital part, for instance the heart. Owing to its extreme fineness, the victim scarcely felt even a prick when the dart entered ; he noticed nothing, there was no wound, and the needle lay and festered within tUl death arrived. It was a beautiful idea \u2014 admirable, admirable. Ah, our modern Societies, with their absurd bombs and clumsy explosions, have a good deal to learn from the old Italians.\" Wrapped up in his subject, he spoke on like a connoisseur discussing the merits of some rare work of art. It was with pallid lip3 that Stefan ventured to put a question to him. \" And this brooch ? \" \"Is constructed on the model of the Tebaldi Key. The only improvement I have been able to make is to slightly reduce the length of the needle, and to charge it with highly concentrated poison. I wUl show you how it works.\" The Bishop, his whole soul filled with a shuddering p"], [222, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 210 foreboding of what was to follow, watched his com panion with fascinated eyes, as he displayed the mechanism of the brooch. \"Observe, it is simplicity itself. You wear the brooch at the throat, as usual. The person you wish to aim at approaches you. You, embrace him. The mere pressure of the brooch against his shoulder is sufficient to discharge the spring, and in a few hours he is a corpse. \u2014 What is the name of your dog ? \" \"Ban,\" faltered the prelate \"Here, Ban!\" The dog, a small species of terrier, leapt up to wards the man, who pressed the face of the brooch against its forehead. Instantly it uttered a whine, and leaving the spy ran and rubbed its head against its master's feet. \"Great Heaven!\" gasped the horrified ecclesi astic. \" Have you killed my dog ? \" \"You will see in a few minutes,\" was the calm reply. \" Now you understand the way to use this weapon,\" he added, laying it on the table in front of the Bishop; \"the only thing that remains is to select a suitable time and place.\" \"Do you expect me to use that thing?\" gasped out Stefan. \" Undoubtedly. It has been made for the express purpose.\" \" But I refuse, positively. On no consideration will I submit to such a thing.\" \"Then I fear you will expose yourself to the suspicion of M. Tataroff, and possibly to his resent ment,\" remarked the other with a significant look. The prelate wrung his hands."], [223, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 211 \" Is there no way out of this ? You can save me from it if you like. Write and tell M. Tataroff that the brooch has been broken or is lost, and I will give you a sack of gold.\" \" It would be useless, Monsignor.\" \" Then I offer you two sacks.\" \" That is not what I meant. Your offer is liberal enough. But it would be useless to tell M. Tataroff that this brooch was lost or broken, because he would not be deceived.\" \" And why would he not be deceived ? \" \"Because he has just seen it in use. Monsignor Stefan, I am Ivan Tataroff.\" To describe the state into which the Bishop was plunged by this announcement as consternation would be to use too mild a word. Before he could collect his scattered senses suffi ciently to speak, there was a knock at the door. \"Who is it?\" It was Tataroff who gave the chaUenge. \" M. Baxter.\" And as the door opened this stranger, whom the Russian did not know whether to regard as hostile, friendly, or indifferent, walked easily into the room. In the first rapid glance Mr. Verriter's eye seized the points of the situation, the calm assurance of the supposed guest of Monsignor Stefan, the prelate's Btate of abject coUapse, the brooch lying on the table between them, surrounded by its recent wrappings, and the dog crouching and beginning to whine upon the floor. Affecting the most beautiful unconsciousness of aU these symptoms of some tragedy, the supposed American seated himself in a chair between the"], [224, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 212 other two, and crossing his legs with the cool inde pendence of his nation, remarked \u2014 \"I'm afraid I have brought bad news, Bishop. They tell me that Prince Rodolph is leaving here in a week's time to get married.\" \"You have heard that, have you?\" observed Tataroff, trying to read the other's face. But the American baffled him by his utter non chalance. Affecting to pass over the Russian as hardly worthy of notice, he addressed himself again to the Bishop. \"He is going to marry out of your Church, too, so you won't have the advantage of performing the ceremony.\" The Bishop could scarcely restrain a shudder. The other's remark had suggested to his mind the episcopal embrace, which, in Balkistan, it was the custom to bestow on great occasions of the kind. Before he could answer, however, the attention of all three was distracted by the behaviour of the dog. It suddenly began fiercely growling, then lay down at full length, rolled over and over a few times, and expired. The Bishop could not restrain a cry and an in dignant glance at the author of the animal's fate. That glance was a revelation to the English detective, who, himself only partially suspected by the others, was keenly on the alert with regard to the prelate and his mysterious guest. He saw the Bishop's eye, after resting reproachfully for a moment on the Russian, glance off with loathing at the brooch upon the table, and instantly he divined more than half of the plot. Only one thing remained. It was absolutely"], [225, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 213 necessary for him to obtain possession of what was evidently the weapon which had caused the death of the dog. His own duplicate of the episcopal brooch was at his hotel. He must instantly return and fetch it. He thrust his hand into his pocket, and then, while the Bishop was ringing for an attendant to remove the body of his pet, Mr. Baxter exclaimed \u2014 \" I came here to show your Grace the plan of the workings which I am about to commence on your estate.\" (The lease had been by this time signed.) \" But I find I have left the papers at home. If you wUl allow me, I will go and fetch them. I can be back here in half an hour.\" \" Certainly. Go by aU means, M. Baxter,\" cried the prelate, only too pleased to be rid of his incon venient visitor, though it exposed him to the un pleasant prospect of a tete-a-tete with the dreaded Tataroff. \" Who is that man ? \" demanded the Russian, as his concealed adversary quitted the room. \"We thought you would be able to tell us that,\" was Stefan's retort. \" What do you mean ? Has he been giving himself out as an agent of mine ?\" \" Oh dear, no ; but as he came from Petersburg, and showed so much interest in our party, we thought he might be sent here to watch our pro ceedings.\" \" Fools ! I wonder how much you have let him discover?\" \"Oh, absolutely nothing, I can assure you.\" Stefan spoke with great confidence. \"He knows nothing except what is public property, that Schoffzan"], [226, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 214 and I are friends of the Czar, and desire to see the annexation of Balkistan to Russia.\" \"Do not admit him to your presence again without my permission. I must find out who he reaUy is.\" He soliloquized under his breath \u2014 \"He cannot be a Nihilist\u2014 he uses none of their signs. Yet, who else could have a secret agent here ! Certainly not Rodolph : the Balkiard police are in capable of detective work of that order. Can it be that Iskander has agents in his service of whom I know nothing ? \" He mused a few moments in this strain, and then added, half aloud \u2014 \" It is very strange. I find there is an adverse influence thwarting my plans to which I am not accustomed. Some new power seems to be arrayed against me. Only the other day I found that a certain Embassy in Petersburg had changed the lock of its safe, after I had been at immense pains to secure a key to the former one. Then not only does Simski fail, but his failure is followed by the arrest of Schoffzan and yourself, and this palace is searched.\" \" Reassure yourself, my dear M. Tataroff,\" broke in Stefan at this point. \"They took absolutely nothing by their search.\" \" I should like to be sure of it,\" returned the spy, grimly. \"But my documents \u2014 there are only two which could possibly incriminate any of us \u2014 were left un touched in their hiding-place.\" \" That proves nothing. Let me see them.\" \" Stay here, and I will bring them to you.\""], [227, "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. 215 And the Bishop, who did not mean M. Tataroff to know of his secret repository, hurried out of the room. In less than a minute he returned, and handed the two letters with some triumph to the Russian. The latter glanced at them suspiciously, frowned, sniffed at the autograph from the Czar, and flung the papers from him. \" As I thought ! These letters have been photo graphed.\" \" God ! \" Stefan could say no more. He turned as white as a sheet, and sank back helpless into a chair. \" I can smell the collodion ; and, besides, there is a brown spot in one corner. The man who did it was a bungler at his work, it is true, but that simply proves it was not done by a professional artist, but by a detective. Ay, and I tell you that we are face to face with the ablest man I have ever yet had to encounter, and unless Prince Rodolph is removed speedUy, your neck will not be safe.\" He paused, and then exclaimed \u2014 \"But we must give instant orders that this American is not to be admitted when he returns. The servants can say that you are suddenly in disposed.\" He rang the beU violently. A servant quickly came in response to the summons, and received his instructions. \" By Heaven ! \" said Tataroff, when they were again alone, \" if that man should be against us, and saw the brooch upon the table, we may have some diffi culty stUl. You had better put it away with your other ornaments; it will be really safer that way"], [228, "216 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. than if you locked it up by itself. We may be sur rounded with spies.\" It was a new experience for the arch-spy of Europe, and he looked anything but comfortable. \"As soon as this is finished, I go back to Russia,\" was his inward resolve. \"Well,\" he said to the Bishop, \"you see the position you are in. Rodolph is simply playing with you. He has secured proofs sufficient to send you to the scaffold, and it is simply a question of which of you falls first. What are you going to do ? \" Stefan stretched out a trembling hand, and laid it upon the brooch."], [229, "217 CHAPTER XIII. THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. On the evening of the day which was to witness the return of Count Halstein from his journey to England, Mr. Verriter sauntered leisurely out of his hotel. Standing for a few moments on the pavement, he glanced round, and, in a doorway a httle lower down on the opposite side of the street, caught sight of a crouching figure. He first frowned and then laughed. \"It is the same feUow that followed me this morning,\" he said to himself. \"The fools are actuaUy having me shadowed. This must be the work of the Bishop's Russian friend. I ought to know more about that man. There was something about his face which jarred on me ; but for the life of me I can't think what it was. Well, it is a nuisance to have to take so much trouble, but there is no help for it; I cannot let them dog my movements in this way. It is too absurd.\" He set off at a slow and stately pace down the street, and had the satisfaction of hearing the man who was watching him come out of his lurking-place and patter along in the rear. Verriter walked on tUl he reached a gunsmith's shop, entered it, and purchased a handsome seven-"], [230, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 218 chambered revolver. Having further procured a box of cartridges, he coolly proceeded to load every chamber of the weapon in the shop, to the amaze ment of the proprietor, who knew the American financier by sight, and wondered whether he was going on a lynching expedition, after the manner of his countrymen. The proprietor did not notice a pair of dark, beady eyes peering through the window, and devouring every detail of the American's extraordinary behaviour. But that gentleman was more observant. Issuing from the shop, he stroUed back in the direction of his hotel. When he got within sight of the entrance he pulled up short, and the \" shadow \" almost knocked against him. Verriter instantly drew his revolver and levelled it at the fellow's head. A glance served to show him that he was dealing with a surly brute of a low order of intelligence, and he chose his words accordingly. \"How dare you follow me!\" he exclaimed, with the addition of several powerful Balkiard oaths. \"If ever I catch sight of your dog's face again I will let you have the whole seven bullets. Run ! \" The creature needed no second bidding. He turned and fled for his life. But Mr. Verriter was determined in future to take every possible precaution. It was quite clear that he was an object of suspicion, and he knew well that his enemies were not men to stick at trifles. He entered the hotel, went upstairs, and in half an hour had effected an utter change in his appearance. It was not Ezekiel P. Baxter, the American millionaire, it was a waiter from the cafe\\ dressed to go out,"], [231, "THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. 219 who emerged from the hotel the second time, and pro ceeded at a fast walk in the direction of the palace. This time he was not followed. But his heart gave a great leap as he passed the doorway already referred to, and perceived another \" shadow \" lurking within. Already his adversaries had been informed of the fate of their first agent, and had provided another in his place. He realized for the first time the greatness of his danger, and his own words came back to him, the words he had spoken when accepting this enterprise \u2014 \" If the Russian police should find I was on their track, of course they would have me assassinated.\" But the discovery did not for one moment affect the placid courage which was the Englishman's leading characteristic. Not a sign of emotion was visible in either face or manner as he made his way to the raUway station at which Count Halstein was expected to arrive. The time spent in elaborating his disguise had made the detective a little late, and the train had rolled into the station before he got there. But he was in time to intercept the Count as he stepped into a carriage in waiting to convey him to the palace. \" Cui bono,\" he whispered in the Count's ear, fall ing back on the old watchword. \" Take me with you to the palace.\" Instantly understanding that there was something serious in the wind, the Count, with admirable cool ness, assumed the air of having expected this meeting. \" Step in after me,\" he said aloud, for the benefit of the coachman. And they got in together."], [232, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 220 A glance at Halstein's face was enough to show Verriter what had been the result of his mission. He wore a look of ineffable weariness and despon dency. And, indeed, he was fairly knocked up by the amount of travelling which he had gone through in the time he had been away. Nothing was said till they reached the palace and were safe in the Prince's cabinet. Then Halstein related, in a few brief, bitter sentences, the result of his appeal to statecraft. The great nation, whose sympathies were most likely to be with them, had refused its aid almost without a hearing, thanks to its absorption in the petty squabbles of a village. It was a humiliation. Clearly there was nothing further to be done. Then Verriter took up his tale, and began by relating his evening's experiences. Prince Rodolph was deeply moved. \" My noble fellow, you are risking your life in my service,\" he said. \" But I have no right to expose you to further danger. You have done your share, and must now look out for your own safety.\" \"I shall do that, your Highness may depend; but I shan't go back from this job till I have done what I started to do. However, my work here is over for the present, and my next step must be to go to Switzerland, and put myself in communication with the Nihilists.\" \" I accept your offer. I will say nothing about thanks at present. But at least you wUl not refuse to wear this ring in token of my friendship.\" And he drew a costly diamond off his finger, and presented it to the detective. Mr. Verriter tried to hide his emotion at this"], [233, "THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. 221 graceful act. Muttering a few words of thanks, he took the ring, and then said \u2014 \"But it is your Highness's life which is in danger, far more than mine. A special agent of the Russian police has recently arrived here, and is now staying in the Bishop's palace ; and I have reason to believe he has come here with the sole mission of carrying out your assassination.\" Exclamations of horror escaped the Prince and his secretary. \" How did you find out this ? \" asked the former. The detective briefly described the scene of a day or two before. \" Your Highness may depend on it,\" he concluded, \"that this Melovitch, as he is called, had just killed the dog by means of the brooch which I saw lying on the table, and that he had done so in order to illustrate its fatal powers to the Bishop. That brooch was not manufactured to kill dogs with. It was meant for you.\" Rudolph could not repress a slight shudder. \" And this brooch ?\" \" Is here,\" said Mr. Verriter calmly, taking it from his pocket and laying it upon the table. Rodolph and the Count both rose to their feet with a simultaneous cry, and bent over the murderous object. \" There is no need to sacrifice another dog to explain its working,\" remarked the detective. \"But I have ascertained for myself the principle on which it is constructed.\" And he described it to his fascinated hearers. \" But you have not told us how you contrived to get possession of it,\" _aid the Prince."], [234, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 222 \" That was comparatively easy. I had a similar brooch, as far as outward appearance is concerned, by me, and I went straight from the palace to fetch it, thinking there was no time to be lost. When I got back I was informed that the Bishop had been suddenly taken unwell \u2014 I did not wonder at that \u2014 and could not receive me. I at once asked to see his chaplain. The chaplain came, and I saw that he was the same priest who had bribed me in the affair of the ciborium. Naturally I concluded that he would be willing enough to take a bribe himself. As your Highness may have observed, the priesthood as a class are totally destitute of the sense of honour. The whole aim of their education is to root it out, and replace it by the sentiment of devotion to their Church. If I had asked this rascal to do anything that he considered against his religion, I dare say he would have refused. But when I pretended to be a connoisseur in jewels, and offered him a handsome sum if he could procure me a loan for a short time, unknown to anybody, of the Bishop's new brooch, which I pretended he had been offering to seU me just before, I had no difficulty. He brought it round to me yesterday. I kept him waiting half an hour, for form's sake, and then sent him back with the other. He must have noticed the substitution, but he pocketed his money and made no remarks. \" Mr. Verriter, I despair of repaying such services as yours,\" exclaimed the Prince. \" What do you propose to do with this thing now? \" \" I shall take it to the Nihilists, along with the photographed letters. It is part of our case. In the mean time, I must entreat your Highness to leave Sufarest to-morrow. The men who prepared this"], [235, "THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. 223 brooch will not rest there. Every hour you remain is dangerous.\" \" I wUl do as you desire,\" answered Rodolph. \" I do not see why I should needlessly give chances to these assassins, and I wiU go away for a short time, in the hope that you will succeed in disturbing their plans before I come back.\" He stopped, and sighed to himself. \" But of what use going there ? I can not expect MathUde to share a life like this.\" Further conversation foUowed on the steps to be taken by Verriter, acting on the Prince's behalf, and then the detective slipped out of the palace, and returned to his hotel. The same figure was stiU crouching in the door way, watching with sleepless eyes for the appearance of the American Baxter. \"Watch away, my fine feUow,\" said Verriter to himself, with a shrug of his shoulders. \" I shall be far enough away from you to-morrow.\" He went up to his rooms and began to make his preparations. In the palace of Sufarest Prince Rodolph was engaged in doing the same thing at the same time. Immediately upon the detective's leaving him, he had sent for M. Karkchulov to make that gentleman acquainted with his approaching departure. In less than half an hour the messenger returned, bringing the Minister with him. Late as it was, M. Karkchulov had lost not a moment in responding to the summons. He had been conscious for some time that something was going on behind the scenes, and felt disposed to take his master to task for withholding confidence from his constitutional advisers."], [236, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 224 He found Rodolph in his cabinet, busily sorting some papers. Count Halstein was not present. \" Good evening, M. Karkchulov,\" was the Prince's greeting. \" I sent for you to tell you that I propose leaving Sufarest to-morrow for a short time. I am going on a visit to the Comte de Blois, my uncle.\" M. Karkchulov's face assumed a sullen expression. \" That is rather an important step for your High ness to take without consulting any of the Ministry. Some of us are beginning to feel that we no longer enjoy that amount of confidence from your Highness which is necessary to enable us properly to discharge our duties.\" \"My dear M. Karkchulov, I am sorry to hear you talk in such a strain. So far as I know, only one topic of disagreement has arisen between us, namely, the attempts on my life instigated by Russia, and it is partly on their account that I am making this journey.\" The Minister at once assumed a tone of superiority. \"Your Highness is quite wrong, if I may be per mitted to say so, in taking that matter so seriously. The Minister of Police has just received convincing evidence that the man who fired at you is an escaped lunatic from a State asylum in Russia, and he was coming to the palace to-morrow to ask your directions as to handing him over to the Russian authorities. Your Highness has not the least reason to fear any repetition of the attack.\" \"Indeed! Let me tell you, sir, that I have this evening, in this very room, seen and handled an infernal contrivance, brought here within the last few days from Petersburg, for the express purpose of murdering me.\""], [237, "THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. 225 The Minister was struck dumb. His self-assurance had temporarily deserted him. Prince Rodolph pursued his advantage. \" If I had relied on your police, I might be dead at this moment. Fortunately I trusted to my own instinct, which warned me of the truth with regard to the Simski affair, and I have provided niyself with an efficient protector.\" \"Does your Highness persist, then, in connecting that man with the Russian Government ? \" questioned M. Karkchulov, beginning to feel uncertain as to his ground. For answer the Prince drew forth the copy of Tartaroff's letter, and handed it to his Minister. \" Read that, sir, and do not wonder that I am not the dupe of the stories concocted by the Russian authorities.\" M. Karkchulov read the letter and collapsed. He had just enough obstinacy left for one more question \u2014 \" May I ask when this photograph was taken ? \" \" If you like to enter the episcopal palace, go into Monsignor Stefan's private oratory, take off the lid of the ciborium on the altar, and pull the upper and lower parts asunder, you will find the original : and possibly something more.\" This time M. Karkchulov looked fairly aghast. \" Is it possible! \" he exclaimed. \" And the Chief of the Police had the impudence to assert that nothing had been discovered ! \" \" He found nothing,\" returned the Prince, sarcas tically ; \" except perhaps some little golden keepsakes which he did not think it worth while to mention.\" \"Ah, I see it all ! This was the work of the Q"], [238, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 226 detective from Vienna. I wondered what had become of him. And is he still in Sufarest ? \" \"He has just left me, after showing me the con trivance I have spoken of.\" M. Karkchulov made no effort to speak further. He felt he had made some hideous blunders, and had been hopelessly outdone in sagacity by the young man whom he had presumed to lecture. But Rodolph, with the happy urbanity which con stitutes half the art of modern royalty, strove to take away the sting of his Minister's defeat. \"Do not let us think anything more about these disagreeable incidents,\" he said soothingly. \"As I said some time ago, I regard my personal safety as my own private affair, which I am justified in looking after by myself. But I want to consult you, and through you the rest of the Ministry, about a very different matter. You have before now hinted that it would strengthen my position if I were to marry.\" M. Karkchulov's face brightened up. \" Ah, yes ! If your Highness would only do that, we should feel secure. There has been a rumour about the city this very week that you were very likely to form an alliance, and it has caused the utmost satisfaction. I can think of no step which would do more to settle the country and improve trade.\" \" Thanks. I am glad you take that position. I hope that you will feel equal satisfaction with the name of the princess whom I have in my mind. Of course nothing is settled yet, no formal overtures have been made, but, if I can only secure her consent, I propose to offer my hand to my cousin \""], [239, "THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. 227 \" The Princess MathUde ! \" cried the Minister, in a transport of enthusiasm. \" The very name that the populace have been eagerly whispering ! Ah, your Highness little knows what joy this will cause, should the marriage take place ! And, if it is followed by the birth of an heir, we may bid defiance to the Czar and his instruments.\" In his enthusiasm, the Prime Minister forgot his ordinary prudence, and allowed Rodolph to see that, after all, he was a patriot, and that want of courage, rather than want of sympathy, had held him back so long from any open demonstration against the intrigues of Russia. The revelation came as a comforting stimulus to Rodolph, as he was about to start on his all-important quest. He felt that the dark clouds which had sur rounded his pathway were beginning to lift, and that beyond them lay the prospect of a bright and happy future. He put out his hand with a generous impulse, and grasped that of the Balkiard. \" We have misunderstood each other, M. Kark chulov,\" he said heartily. \"I see that, after all, our hopes and our objects are the same ; and I hope that for the future we shall be able to work together with mutual confidence. I will telegraph to you as soon as I have any news. Good-bye.\" And the next morning he was on his way. The Princess Claudine had consented to accompany him, and they discussed their plans upon the journey. It was agreed that, while Rodolph sought to win the consent of Mathilde, his mother should lay siege to the Comte de Blois. The Princess felt that she was undertaking the"], [240, "228 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. harder task of tho two, but evon sho did not anticipate so much difficulty as sho actually found. When sho first broached the subject, indcod, tho Count mot hor with a flat refusal, and refused even to liston to any argument upon tho subject. This was on the day after their arrival at tho Castle. The first evening had been given up to dis cussing the situation in France, and the poor dreamer's chances of gaining that crown which was ever floating, like the Holy Grail, before his oyos, but never came within roach of his grasp. A severe blow had just been struck at his party from the source whence he had least expected it, namely, the Church of which his family, had for centuries been the devoted champions. The head of this Church, wearied of perpetual discord, in the interests of a decaying cause, with a Government which seemed firmly established, had just held out the olive leaf, by publicly onjoining tho clerical element in France to render loyal allegiance to tho existing institutions of the country. Faithful to tho decree, half the Count's adherents had forsaken their attitudo of hostility, thereby splitting up his already meagre following, and reducing him to a position little stronger than that of the last of the Stuarts when the Tories went over in a body at tho accession of George III. The Count, in spite of his sincere piety, did not hesitate to attribute this policy to the lowest possible motives. \" The Pope is a fool,\" ho said bitterly to Claudine. \" Ho thinks the present Government will support him in his insane project of recovering tho States of the Church. As if that could ever happen, no"], [241, "THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. 229 matter what efforts he made ! He hopes to get Russia and France to take up the question, and then, by detaching Austria from the Triple Alliance, he thinks the other Powers wiU have to submit. Such wUd ideas are out of harmony with the age. Why cannot the Pope abandon his absurd chimera, and use his influence towards some practical end?\" Poor man ! he did not see what a bitter application his remarks might have to his own ambitions, equally vain and futile with those at which he sneered. Claudine was too skUful a diplomate not to humour him. She sought to turn the discussion to Rodolph's advantage. \" The Pope must be taught that it is only by keeping faithful to the monarchical tradition that he has any chance of maintaining himself, and adding to the power of his Church,\" she observed. \"He wUl find that his desertion of our family injures him with all the legitimate rulers. The Emperor of Austria wUl not approve of it. And, as far as Balkistan is concerned, he may give up all hope of the Balkiard Church recognizing his supremacy. Rodolph wUl resent this business as much as you do.\" The deluded claimant took this as a matter of course, and continued to weary his sister for some time longer with complaints of the various Powers who showed such a strange indifference to his cause, and the members of his party in France who had so shamefuUy fallen off at the word of the Pope. Her eyes opened as they had never been before by the manly words of her son before they left Sufa rest, even Claudine began to tire of this monotonous castle-building in the air, and to perceive some of the"], [242, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 230 hollowness and absurdity of the intrigues to which she had devoted so much of her career. The next morning, Princess Claudine spoke to her brother on the subject of Rodolph. The Count's manner of receiving the topic was discouraging. \"He is a very unfortunate young man,\" he re marked. \"He has managed to offend the Czar beyond recall, and I half regret that I ever gave my consent to his accepting the offer of the throne.\" Claudine bridled up at this selfish declaration. \"I do not see that my son is to blame,\" she retorted, \"seeing that the only offence he has given the Czar has been by that very acceptance, to which you gave your full consent at the time.\" \"I dare say I did; but how was I to see how it would turn out?\" was the querulous reply. \"What is the good of his staying there, if nobody wants him?\" \"Indeed you are mistaken, sire,\" answered the Princess, giving her brother the title which she knew he loved to hear. \" Rodolph enjoys the thorough loyalty of the Balkiards ; the only plots against him are the work of Russian emissaries, and a few natives in the pay of Russia.\" The Comte de Blois shrugged his shoulders, as if the subject did not greatly interest him. \" There is only one thing wanted to make Rodolph's position absolutely secure,\" went on the Princess boldly, \" and that is a wife who will help him to do the honours of the palace, and in the course of time bring him an heir to the Principality.\" This time the Count began to perceive there was something in the wind."], [243, "THIRD STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE. 231 \" Speak out, Claudine. You are always going some roundabout way. Whom do you mean ? \" \" I mean Mathilde,\" said the Princess, firmly. \" My daughter ! I will not hear of it ! \" Claudine kept her temper admirably. \"It is for you to decide, of course, sire,\" she answered with much humility. \" Both of the young people, I am sure, wUl be ready to sacrifice then- own wishes for the good of our House.\" \" Sacrifice their wishes ! What do you mean ? I wish you would speak out plainly! Has Rodolph dared to pay court to my daughter without my per mission?\" \" Sire, you are unjust. My son is far too loyal, his devotion to you is far too great, for him to dream of such a thing. But we women have the power of drawing conclusions from trifles, and I have long been of the opinion that such a match would be highly agreeable to them both.\" \" I am astonished that you should propose such a thing, Claudine. I gave you credit for more sense. Do you not see that it would alienate from me my best friend among the sovereigns of Europe, Is kander III. ? \" \" Pardon me, sire, but I have thought of all that. At present Iskander III. is your friend, it is true, but he is bound to you by no ties of interest. Yesterday the Pope was your friend also \u2014 to-day he has thrown himself into the arms of the Republican Government. Political necessities may induce Iskander to do the same to-morrow.\" The Comte de Blois uttered an exclamation. His sister saw that she was on the right track, and con tinued \u2014"], [244, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 232 \" On the other hand, supposing you bestowed Mathilde's hand upon Rodolph, he would be bound to you by the strongest ties, ties so strong that the destinies of Balkistan would practically be in your hands. That would give you the very lever you want with Iskander. If at any time it should become vitally necessary in your interests to secure his Bupport, you would only have to say to him, ' Assist me to regain my throne, and, in return, Rodolph shall surrender Balkistan to you.' \" The Count remained silent. Claudine saw that her arrow had gone to the mark, and discreetly broke off the conversation. Some hours later in the day two people stood out in the moonlight, where it bathed the terraces of the Castle. They were speaking in subdued voices, sinking every now and then to a whisper. \"You see how I am situated. I have kept back nothing. I carry my life in my hands. What right have I to ask any woman to share such a lot as that?\" And the answer came \u2014 \" There is only one woman whom you have the right to ask. And she would gladly share a lot ten fold worse than yours, because \" \" Because ? \" \" She \u2014 loves you.\" Two days afterwards M. Karkchulov received the following telegram : \u2014 \"Announce to my people my betrothal to the Princess Mathilde-Claudine-Marie of Blois. \u2014 Ro dolph.\""], [245, "THIED STAGE OF THE STEUGGLE. 233 Claudine had triumphed. She had succeeded in persuading the egotistic schemer that the happiness of his daughter coincided with his own miserable fantastic interests, and his consent followed as a matter. of course."], [246, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 234 CHAPTER XIV. THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. The Executive Committee of the greatest secret society of Europe was represented in the capital of London by three persons. On a certain night, shortly after the departure of Prince Rodolph from Sufarest, these three were met at the residence of their chief, to discuss an important communication just received by him from the head quarters of the society in Switzerland. The three men represented three different classes of society. One was a Count, and the former owner of extensive landed estates in Russia. The second was an ex-professor in a Russian university. The third was a working printer from Petersburg. Two of these men had originally been perfectly loyal subjects of the Russian Government, and even now their sentiments on political questions would have caused them to be reckoned as conservative in many countries of Europe. The third was imbued with democratic ideas of a thoroughgoing character, but even he had nothing in common with the hare brained creatures who take to dynamite as saner men take to dumb-bells, and who, if they were shut up in padded rooms and laughed at, instead of being accorded the honour of solemn trial and"], [247, "THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 235 martyrdom amid the awe of a terrified world, would rapidly disappear from our midst. Count Felix Volonsky had lived to the age of thirty five without ever troubling his head about politics. Happy in the possession of a wife who adored him, and whom he tenderly loved, the father of three beautiful children, and the owner of an ancient title and estate, he had lived the ordinary life of a man of fashion, in his own province or amid the gaieties of the capital. But one day it was his misfortune to attract the regard of a beautiful woman of high rank, whose indifference to her own husband had become a matter of notoriety in the higher circles in Petersburg. To this attachment he failed to respond. She con tinued to pursue him with her attentions until it became necessary to choose between unfaithfulness to his own wife or the insult of a refusal to the Princess L . He chose the latter, and the furious woman swore to be revenged. She was as good as her word. Previous liaisons, into the character of which it is not necessary to enter, had secured for her a powerful secret influence in the Ministry of Justice. A denunciation was lodged, and at an hour's warning Count Volonsky was dragged from the midst of his family, convicted, on the flimsiest and most perjured evidence, of treasonable conspiracy, and sentenced to a term of three years' imprisonment in a fortress. When he came out, his first step was to solicit permission to sell his estates and leave the country. This was obtained with some difficulty, and at a ruinous expense in bribes to the various officials through whose hands the permit had to pass. As soon as he had realized the still considerable remains"], [248, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 236 of his property, he started for England with his wife and family. At the frontier they were stopped, and an official, acting under instructions whose source was plainly evident to the Count's mind, informed him that the permission granted to him did not extend to his family. He was at liberty, however, to take with him his wife and two younger children. The eldest boy must remain to be educated, at his father's expense, in a Government seminary. That was the last blow. Volonsky, up to that moment, had entertained no real idea of joining in any conspiracy against the Czar's Government. He now saw that there was only one career which manhood allowed him to embrace. The moment he arrived in London he joined the Nihilist organization. In this body his rank and wealth commanded their natural influence. He rapidly rose to the position of president of the branch of the society established in England. Professor Zernow had hardly been so deeply injured, but his hatred against the power which had persecuted him was even greater than the Count's. He, too, had been guiltless of ever in thought or word con spiring against his Government. But in the university of which he was one of the most distinguished orna ments, a Nihilist society had been formed amongst the students. Of this the professor was unaware, and, had he known it, it would not have greatly interested him. His whole mind was given up to the study of chemistry, and a new combination of gases was infinitely more interesting to him than a change in the composition of cabinets. But in his leisure hours he was a kindly and"], [249, "THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 237 hospitable man, and it was his custom to assemble at his house some of the more promising students for social intercourse. Among those who thus came to see him were several members of the secret society. When their existence was discovered, the pohce chose to include Zernow among their arrests, and to treat him as an instigator and fomentor of the conspiracy. The evidence of his association with the ringleaders was deemed amply sufficient to establish his guilt, and he was exiled to the Siberian provinces. Thanks to his more than local reputation as a scientist, the Government did not venture to degrade him to manual labour, and the conditions of his exile were easy enough. But he resented the wrong which had been done him with all the bitterness of a disposition naturally mild but outraged in its deepest feelings of justice. He seized a favourable opportunity to escape, crossed the whole of Russia in the depth of winter on foot, and never rested till he was safe in the asylum of England. There he became the fiercest and most unrelenting foe that the Russian Government had to deal with, and his hand was to be traced in several of the most daring plots of the great society. Paul Welberg, the third of the trio, was a totaUy different character. Of German descent, he had grown up in the democratic atmosphere of a printer's office, had taken some part in a radical propaganda among his fellow- workmen, and then, finding that he was likely to get into trouble with the authorities at Petersburg, had emigrated first to one country, then to another, till he finally dropped anchor in London. It was made a point among the Nihilists to encourage the adherence of the working"], [250, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 238 classes, and Paul's abUities being recognized he was admitted a member of the Executive. The real power, however, lay in the hands of his two col leagues, and chiefly iu those of Zernow. He was the typical NihUist, and nothing of importance had been undertaken by the society in any part of the world, without his knowledge, for some years past. As soon as the three leaders had taken their seats in the Count's library \u2014 for they deemed it useless to affect secrecy as to their place of meeting \u2014 Zernow, acting as secretary, opened the conference. \" The letter which I have received from Geneva,\" he said, \" is of a very disquieting character. It throws a doubt on the fidelity of one of our most trusted members \u2014 in short, the chief of our organi zation in Russia.\" \" Ivan Tataroff ! Nonsense ! \" exclaimed Paul. Count Volonsky looked at Zernow to continue. \" Ivan Tataroff is the man referred to.\" \"Why, it was he who contrived the death of Iskander II. ! \" said the incredulous Paul. \" Yes, and it was also he who contrived the mine under the Czar's dining-haU.\" \" His past record is a reason for judging him fairly, not for shutting our ears to accusations,\" remarked the president, gravely. \"It was the betrayal of the mine which aroused suspicion against him,\" went on the secretary. \" The secret was known to a good many, it is true, but all of them were carefully watched \u2014 with the ex ception of Tataroff. Ever since the affair of Is kander II. , he has been allowed great privileges. The question now is whether he has not abused them. No positive proof, I understand, is as yet"], [251, "THE STEUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 239 forthcoming, but for the future a strict secret watch wiU be set upon him.\" \"For my part, I don't beheve there is anything in it,\" commented Paul. \"Why, in Petersburg we always found him our best protector ! He gave several of our feUows a hint to slip off in time, before the pohce moved.\" \" Exactly,\" said Volonsky, dryly. Zernow looked very serious. \"It wiU be a terrible blow to the society, if it turns out that he is a traitor. He wUl have to be removed at all costs.\" The other two nodded. Any of the three might be the one selected to carry out the sentence of the society on the traitor, but that consideration did not affect their minds for a moment in deciding as to his fate. \" What is he doing now ? \" asked the president \"That is a mystery. He disappeared suddenly a few days ago, and no one has the slightest idea where he ha3 gone. Formerly nothing would have been thought of it \u2014 we should have assumed that he was off somewhere on the work of the society; but now suspicion has been aroused, and his absence is not liked.\" The Count put a pregnant question. \" Is it possible that he has smelt the danger, and purposely hidden himseU to escape our vengeance ? \" \"I do not think so. In fact, it is since his departure from Petersburg that the suspicion has arisen.\" \" Ah ! just as I thought ! \" sneered Paul. \" U Tataroff himself were about, no one would think of accusing him.\""], [252, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 240 At this juncture the conference was disturbed. There was a low tap at the door. Count Volonsky rose softly, walked towards it, noiselessly unlocked it, and passed out. He was gone about two minutes. When he re turned, his comrades saw that something strange had happened. \" Gentlemen,\" he said, after he had closed and re-locked the door, \"there is a man in the house who desires to be admitted to our presence, to lay before us a matter which he says is of the greatest importance. He brings the highest credentials from the best friends of our society in this country, and also a private autograph note from Prince Rodolph of Balkistan.\" \"That settles it,\" remarked Paul. \"We don't want to have anything to do with princes or their friends.\" \"I think it settles it the other way,\" said Zernow, quietly. \" The only enemy we fight is the Czar. Prince Rodolph is an enemy of the Czar, and there fore our natural ally. I move that this man be admitted.\" \" Is he a Balkiard ? \" demanded Paul. \" No, an Englishman.\" \" That makes a difference. Well, I consent.\" \"I am of the same opinion,\" said the president, and withdrew to fetch the stranger. Another minute, and Mr. Verriter found himself in the presence of the men he had travelled so far to seek. He was surprised at their being so few in number. But he quickly found himself at his ease, and in a few clear sentences explained his mission. \"I come here in the strictest confidence, on behalf"], [253, "THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 241 of the Prince of Balkistan. The Czar, against whom you are at war, seeks to annex Balkistan to his empire. The means he employs is the assassination of Prince Rodolph. I have come here authorized to conclude with you, if you are willing, an offensive and defensive alliance.\" \" Do you produce any proofs against the Czar ? \" \"Here is a letter from him to the head of the plotters in Balkistan.\" The president took the photograph. \" This is the handwriting of Iskander III.,\" he pronounced, and read it aloud. \"Where did you get this ? \" Verriter described his search in the Bishop's Palace. \" Have you any further documents ? \" \" This \u2014 which was found in the same place.\" The president took it, looked at the signature, and gave a great cry. \" What is it ? \" burst from the other two. \" This is from Tataroff ! Listen ! \" And amid breathless silence he read out the famous letter commending to the Czar's friends in Sufarest the man who came to assassinate Prince Rodolph. A stern dreadful look passed across Zernow's face. \"This must be sent to Geneva,\" he said. \"After that letter there can be no more doubts.\" The detective could not understand the sensation he had produced. \" Are you so surprised as all that ? \" he asked. \" You do not understand,\" replied Volonsky. \" The importance of this letter to us is in revealing the true character of a man who has hitherto been regarded with trust by our society. By laying this R"], [254, "THE PKINCE OF BALKISTAN. 242 before us you have done us an immense service, and Prince Rodolph may depend upon it that he has not sought our help in vain. He wUl get no more agents sent to Sufarest by Ivan Tataroff.\" \" I wish I could be so sure of that. I have reason to believe that there is one such agent there at this moment.\" \" How do you know it ? \" \" Because he brought with him this brooch.\" And Verriter explained how he had come into possession of the deadly toy, the mechanism of which he made clear to his listeners. As he laid the brooch down on the table the Nihilist secretary took it up and played with it carelessly. \" I should like to know more about this agent,\" he said. \" Can you describe him to us ? \" \" The name he passes under is Melovitch. He is not very tall, medium figure, dark hah \u2014 but there, I have no doubt he is thoroughly disguised, so it seems useless to speak of his beard and clothes. He set spies upon me, but I shook them off. At least,\" added the detective, \"I thought I had, but I am not so certain as I should like to be.\" Zernow seemed to be absorbed in thought, as his hand closed tighter over the brooch. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"did you happen to notice any peculiarity about the face of this Melovitch ? \" The detective knitted his brows. \" That is just what annoyed me,\" he answered. \" There is something out of the way, unpleasant, but I cannot fix in my mind what it is.\" The Nihilist committee began to look excited. Zernow pursued his questioning."], [255, "THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 243 \" Is it anything in connection with his eyes ? \" \"Of course!\" from Verriter. \"You are right. There is a cast in his eyes.\" The secretary slipped the brooch into his pocket, and rose from the table. The other two followed his movements with agitated looks. \"Why, who is he?\" demanded Verriter, the hght beginning to break upon him. \" Tataroff himself, one of the ablest and most unscrupulous villains the world has ever seen.\" \" Great Heaven ! And I thought I was dealing with an ordinary police agent. I see it all. That was his spy who foUowed me when I came here.\" \" How was the spy dressed ? \" It was still Zernow who spoke. \"In a grey overcoat, plaid trousers, tall hat,\" hastily responded Verriter. \" Did you notice what he did when you came in ? \" \" Yes. He haUed a passing cab and got into it.\" The secretary moved towards the door. \" He is now on his way to Sufarest. I may be just in time to travel by the same express. Gentlemen, I am sorry we cannot wait for the authority of head quarters, but this is a case of urgency, and I take it upon myself. The moment Tataroff hears that this gentleman has been with us, he will fly for his life, and we shall never catch him up again.\" And without stopping to hear another word he strode out of the room. The Nihilist secretary, Zernow, was not a man to lose time in idle preparations. Accustomed to a life of change and constant hazard, he went about in a state of preparedness for any and every emergency. On the present occasion he did not even take the"], [256, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 244 time to go home and leave word of his intended departure. His sole preparation for a journey across Europe was the purchase, on his way to the station, of a bag, some changes of linen, and a rug. His promptness served him well. On arriving at the terminus which served as the point of departure for travellers to the East, he found pacing the platform a man in a grey overcoat, plaid trousers, and a tall hat. The train was not yet ready to start, and the spy, for such there could be no doubt he was, was idly strolling up and down. Zernow scrutinized him closely as he strolled past, and mentally noted that he carried no portmanteau of his own. This trifling circumstance puzzled him, and he kept a closer watch on the stranger in con sequence. His vigilance was rewarded. Ensconced in a corner behind a railway bookstall, where he was not likely to attract notice himself, he could see the man in the grey overcoat draw out his watch and glance im patiently, first at the train, and then at the direc tion from which the passengers were approaching. Presently he gave a quick look of relief, and stepped forward to meet a dark, hangdog-looking creature, swathed up as if in readiness for a journey, and carrying a sufficiency of luggage. It was Ivan Tataroff's masterpiece. Anticipating that the trained eye of the detective who had already once baffled his spies was likely to pick out any other agent whom he might send upon his track, he had arranged for services of relays. One man had dogged Verriter's journey to England ; another, warned by telegraph from the last stage but one of the journey, had been sent by the Russian Embassy to"], [257, "THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 245 meet him on his arrival, and follow his steps wherever they might lead through the mazes of the great capital; a third had been told off to look out for the second at the departure of each trans-European express, and convey any intelligence that it might be important for Tataroff to learn. The arch-plotter was far too wary a man to trust to the public tele graph, and to confide in the fallacious precaution of cyphers. But for Zernow's lightning-like rapidity of decision this elaborate strategy would have been perfectly successful, and Tataroff, warned of the quarter in which Verriter was seeking assistance, would have had time to mature his plans. As it was, his envoy and the Nihilist secretary, after a journey of two days' duration, arrived in Sufarest together. The Russian spy, profoundly unconscious of the enemy who was foUowing in his trail, boldly chartered a droshky and proceeded to the St. Stefan Hotel, where he expected to find his employer. The Nihilist followed him in a similar vehicle, and was already seated in the public cafe when the other descended from his bedroom and entered in search of M. Tataroff. He had not long to wait. Punctually as the clock struck eight Monsignor Stefan's guest pushed through the door, arm-in-arm with M. Schoffzan. They sat down together and called for brandy. Then the watchful Zernow saw the man he had followed during the last few days lounge carelessly over to the table where they were, and make some remark to his chief. Tataroff looked round, saw no one else near but a quiet-looking stranger, apparently absorbed in an"], [258, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 246 evening paper, and rose quickly from his chair, saying to Schoffzan \u2014 \" Excuse me for a minute ; this gentleman brings me a message on business.\" Schoffzan nodded, and the two retired to a distant corner. \" What is your name ? \" began Tataroff. \" Lipmann, Excellency,\" was the answer. \" Do not call me that. I am simply M. Melovitch. You come from England ? \" \" I do, Ex I do, sir. I am attached to the Embassy.\" \" Good. Now, what news do you bring ? \" \"The man you desired to have watched has arrived in London. He is an English detective, named Verriter \" \" Verriter ! The man who gave us so much trouble over Albert Berne's case ? \" \"The same, sir. M. Melovitch's look boded no good to the detective if ever he came within his power again. \" Well, go on.\" \"After paying several visits to influential person ages whose names I can furnish you with, and who are all known to be unfriendly to his Apostolic Majesty \u2014 whom God preserve ! \u2014 he was seen to enter the house of Count Volonsky.\" Tataroff Btruck his fist on the table. \" The President of the Executive.\" \"Exactly, your Excellency. After seeing him in side, our agent came away at once to the railway and gave me the information. He then went back to the Count's to renew his watch, and a close surveillance will be kept on Verriter till further orders from you.\""], [259, "THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 247 A marked change had passed over the face of the great spy. When he had been threatened with dis missal and death by his Imperial master, he had braved the danger courageously enough, for he felt himself secure. Now he found himself face to face with a peril of a far different character, and his whole body trembled, and his heart turned sick within him. He, Tataroff, the successful intriguer, the trusted head of both police and revolutionists, the real despot of Russia, saw himself suddenly standing beside a precipice. For the first time in his life, he realized the awful dangers of the part he had played for so long. He listened to the words of the agent like a man down at the bottom of a pit listening to the prattle of children playing round the top. What was Verriter to him, or Prince Rodolph either ? The days of revenge, of triumphant plotting and man\u0153uvring, were over. Henceforth his whole energies must be concentrated on one single task, the task of pre serving his own desperate life. He spoke in tones so changed that even the spy was startled. \"Further surveillance is useless. When he was permitted to enter that house the mischief was done, and it is past recall. You may return to England when you please, and teU them so. I will see that your fidelity is reported in the proper quarters.\" Lipmann muttered his thanks and stole away, scared as a jackal might be if it came unawares on some huge tiger in the toils. Tataroff lay back in his chair, all livid, and wiped the sweat from his brow. This man, whose trade had been assassination for twenty years, felt as if"], [260, "248 THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. a hundred knives were pointing at his back. He turned round with B convulsive start, and saw behind him the stranger whose presence he had already remarked. The stranger had laid aside his newspaper, and was walking quietly up to the shaken wretch, with the evident intention of accosting him. Tataroff had not even a suspicion of his real purpose. The danger he anticipated was not an immediate one. His active brain was already re volving plans of escape, the disguises he might assume, the places at which he might secure a temporary retreat. He was hugging himself with the thought that his present place of abode was a secret to the society, and that he might make his preparations with ample leisure. So it was with a manner free from distrust that he said to the new-comer \u2014 \" Do you want to speak to me ? \" The stranger sat down in front of him without replying. He put his hand into his pocket and drew forth a small parcel, wrapped in paper. \" What is that, sir ? \" demanded the astonished Tataroff, with something of his old bullying air. \" It is a curio which I wish to show you,\" said the other. And he carefully and deliberately took off the outer wrapping. A second layer of paper was underneath, which he also removed, and then another and another. Tataroff lost all patience. \" Are you trifling with me, sir ? \" The stranger looked him gravely in the face. \" No,\" he said, and resumed his unwrapping as it nothing had happened."], [261, "THE STEUGGLE DEAWS TO AN END. 249 Presently the object inside began to take shape. It was evidently a small, round article, but Tataroff was as far off as ever from suspecting what he was about to see. At last the final layer was removed. \" Great God ! \" The spy recoUed as tf the barrel of a revolver had been thrust in his face. It was the first hint he had received that the contrivance he had designed, and entrusted to the Bishop, had left that prelate's keeping. The idea that instantly occurred to him was that he was in the presence of one of the Balkiard pohce. Acting on that impression, he puUed himseU together with wonderful energy, and demanded \u2014 \" Why do you show me this ? \" The stranger calmly began wrapping up his prize again. \"Speak, sir; who are you, and what do you want ? \" The person thus addressed added another fold of paper. An explanation flashed across the spy's mind. \" Perhaps you would be wUling to seU that curio of yours ? \" he said. The process of wrapping up continued. \" I wiU give you \" \u2014 he named a sum equivalent to \u00a3500\u2014 \"for it.\" The outside layer was put on. \"\u00a31000.\" The stranger, without moving one muscle of his face, slipped the package back into his pocket. \" \u00a32000, then. Name your own price ! \" \" My curio is not for sale, Ivan Tataroff.\""], [262, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 250 Again the spy was startled to his innermost depths. Again he failed to make a guess at the identity of the man before him. \"Who, in the name of God, are you? And why do you call me by that name ? \" \"Your friends in Petersburg have missed you,\" was the reply, made in the same quiet, dispassionate tone, which yet searched the very heart of the man who heard it. \" What friends ? What do you mean ? Speak plainly ! \" It was a faint attempt to return to the bluster of old. It failed miserably. \" Your time has been badly employed of late. You had no business to come to Sufarest. You should not have invented this ingenious toy, or at least you should not have destined it to such a purpose as the death of Prince Rodolph.\" The spy tried to resort to denial. \" I know nothing of what you say. I never meddled with Prince Rodolph.\" He might as well have addressed a stone wall. \"Above all, you should not have hired the man who calls himself Simski. You should not have furnished him with a letter to the Czar's friends.\" \" I deny it. I never wrote such a letter. Produce it if you can.\" \" I have not got it. It is contained in the ciborium of Monsignor Stefan's oratory, between the two halves of the cover.\" Tataroff was silenced by this crushing statement. He began to fear that the Bishop had betrayed him. \" For what reason do you say all these things to me?\""], [263, "THE STRUGGLE DRAWS TO AN END. 251 \"To give you an opportunity to answer them. Your friends do not judge a man without calling on him for his defence. If you have one, you had better make it.\" For the first time it began to dawn on Tataroff that he was dealing, not with a Balkiard, but with a representative of the Nihilists. \"You take me by surprise,\" he answered feebly. \"I know not where you come from.\" \" I come from England,\" was the stern reply ; \"from London.\" Then his position began to burst upon the un happy traitor. He had been out-generalled, beaten at his own game. His spies must have deceived him, or been deceived, and Verriter must have been in communication with the Nihilists earlier than they had told him. That was the only explanation that occurred to him. He sat and stared helplessly at the man opposite him. As he did so, the other put up his hand to his face and began to stroke his left eyebrow. There is a secret in use among the leading Nihilists as a means of distinguishing messages from the society from false summonses sent by the pohce. A touch of the forefinger on the left eyebrow signifies, \" Attend the meeting you are asked to.\" A second touch from the middle finger conveys, \" The matter is urgent.\" The use of the third finger adds, \" It is a question of life and death.\" But when the fourth finger is used as well, the summons assumes its sternest import. It means, \"Death to you if you refuse.\" With eyes glued to the stranger's face, Tataroff watched him slowly pass the first finger along his"], [264, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 252 eyebrow. Then came the second. Then the third. Then there was an instant's pause, and the arch traitor drew a breath. But the stranger went on, and the fourth finger delivered its fatal message. Tataroff's heart seemed to stop beating. The stranger rose calmly to his feet. \" I shall expect you in my room in the course of an hour,\" was all he said. \" And the name \u2014 what name ? \" the other had just strength to gasp. \"Professor Zernow.\" The name told all. As soon as his judge had withdrawn, the stricken man groped rather than walked to the door, and passed out of the hotel, with his brain buzzing and whirling like the brain of a man who has been struck a stunning blow."], [265, "253 CHAPTER XV. DELIVERANCE. Why did Zernow give the doomed man this oppor tunity for escape ? Why did he offer the form of a trial to one whose guilt towards his society was beyond the sphere of doubt ? All secret societies that flourish for any length of time have their laws. The Vehmgericht of the Middle Ages gave a trial to the offenders whom it singled out for judgment, and prescribed formalities for summoning them before it, not less precise than those of a modern court of judicature. For without such rules, and the strictest adherence to them on the part of all its members, such a society de generates into a mere band of indiscriminate assassins, and its members cease to have confidence in each other's integrity or in their own. The secretary of the Central Executive, if he had departed from the fixed routine of his society, would have been deemed, and would have deemed himself, a criminal. He gave the man whom he had marked down an hour's law, as our ancestors gave the ordeal to an offender taken in the act. Did he expect his victim to surrender at the conclusion of the hour ? No. But he knew that there was no spot in Europe which could conceal him if he fled."], [266, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 254 And so Tataroff fled. Without stopping to think out any definite plan, without having any goal clearly in his mind, he rushed off wildly through the darkness. Should he betake himself to the raUroad ? No ; he feared the watch which might be kept at all the stations, the observation of innumerable officials all along the line. The idea came to him, as he strode fiercely along the streets, to mount on horseback then and there, and dash away across the lonely fields. That was the way to disappear, he thought, and leave no scent behind. In the suburbs of Sufarest he met a man riding a tall, powerful-looking horse. He stopped him, and in a few moments, without staying, indeed, to count the notes he gave, he had struck a bargain for the animal. Then, hastily adjusting the stirrups to his own height, he leaped upon the horse's back, and turned its head to the north. It has long ago dawned upon the reader who were the heroes of the ride described at the opening of this story. Tataroff was the man in front, Zernow was the man who followed. It was from Nihilism that Ivan Tataroff fled, not from a single Nihilist. He fled from a great invisible Presence, an all-encompassing web, whose meshes he himself had helped to weave, and in which he had caught and crushed so many of those who had stopped his path. A spider entangled in its own threads might have furnished an emblem for this man's horrible case. So he rode the race already told of, and his pursuer kept behind. It was not Zernow who wished to kill Tataroff."], [267, "DELIVERANCE. 255 That was the business of the society. If his own hand could be spared the task, so much the better. By now the highest tribunal of the society, the great Committee of Geneva, had received the proofs of Tataroffs guilt and of Zernow's mission. Let the traitor flee. Routed from his hiding-place, forced to abandon without warning all his plots and schemes, to fly with his evil work undone, Zernow's first object had been achieved. Now it only remained not to lose sight of the fugitive. He had anticipated the first direction of his flight. It was with undisturbed mind that he saw him graduaUy drawing nearer to the territories of the Czar, and preparing to pass beyond the border. That territory could furnish no refuge for the object of Nihilist vengeance. Rather would they be able there to hold him at their mercy, to proceed against him deliberately, and to carry out their sentence with those dramatic adjuncts on which they relied for the sake of deterring others. And so the Nihilist kept on steadily in the rear. But when Tataroff reached the Czar's dominions he showed no signs of slackening his pace. And a strange thing happened. Instead of heading ever northwards till he reached the great white capital of Petersburg, and entrenched himself among a hundred thousand soldiery, he wheeled to the right, and com menced that memorable race to the desert. As they flew on, and the Tartar wastes drew nearer and nearer, a terrible suspicion crossed Zernow's mind. He thought that fear had driven the man before him mad. Tataroff was mad. But his madness was only limited. It paralyzed all the actions of his brain"], [268, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 256 that did not tend to the one object of his own safety. But within that narrow compass his thoughts had never been more clear. During the first days of his long ride he had evolved a perfect scheme of preserva tion. And that scheme was this. The counsel he had given his master in their last interview had been followed, and that promptly. The Czar, like his secret Minister, had begun to feel him self unsafe in Europe. He determined to seek refuge for a time in his Asiatic dominions. He gave orders for preparations to be instantly made for his corona tion in Samarcand. Those orders were being carried out. While Europe was wondering at the idea, Asia was being roused into a fitting display of loyalty. The usual forerunners of a Russian monarch's presence, soldiery and police, were drafted off in great numbers to the ancient capital of Tartary, and the Czar himself, accompanied by his whole court, followed in their train. All this was known to Tataroff. His mind was fixed accordingly. He would ride the whole way to this strange city in the East, throwing his enemies hopelessly off the trail, leaving Nihilism and its menaces a thousand miles behind ; and there he would make peace with the Czar, resign for ever his secret and perilous part, and obtain as his reward the post of Governor of Samarcand. Under another name, and in some new and impenetrable disguise, he might reign over his Asiatic province for years, his very existence unsuspected by the terrible society he had betrayed. With these hopes he rode on till he could ride no more. And then, betaking himself to the jolting"], [269, "DELIVERANCE. 257 droshky and its hack steeds, he set forward over the salt deserts that lie around the inland seas. Zernow felt no dismay at being left a stage behind. At length he had fathomed the fugitive's design. He, too, had heard of the Asiatic coronation which had awakened the attention of the world. He set his face steadily forward, and his inquiries after the traces of the man in front became few. A fortnight later, by lavish bribes to those that drove him, and by harnessing an extra pair of horses, he caught his victim up. Side by side their two vehicles passed through the western gate of Samar cand. The ancient fantastic city of Samarcand presented a deeply interesting spectacle, had either of the two new arrivals, Zernow and Tataroff, had the leisure to attend to it. It was a strange commingling of the extremes of savagery and civilization, of the East and the West, of the modern and the antique. Bazaars hke those of Baghdad, with the mingled splendour and dirt of ages, pert shops sparkling like the windows in the Palais Royal with a thousand baubles from the factories of Birmingham and Paris, were planted almost side by side, and past them wandered the mingled crowds of wild Turcomans, Persian merchants with grave mien and sober glance, stout, bearded Turks, the thin and swarthy Afghan, Parsees from Bombay, and even the pale peculiar countenances of the children of the Dragon land. Amid them all, not domineering with the insulting scorn with which the Briton treats his subject peoples, but rubbing shoulders on terms of apparent equality, moved the Russian conquerors of Tartary. Gay cavalrymen with clinking spurs ; sturdy foot soldiers s"], [270, "THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. 258 accustomed to plunge into the desert at an hour's warning, and march perhaps twenty -four hours before they gained some brackish pool at which to quench their thirst; officers of manly bearing but rough manners, ready at a word to take affront, but easily appeased, and full of natural kindliness towards their men: all these and other represen tatives of Europe moved in and out among the Asiatics, without disturbing the harmony of the scene. And why should they, since their invasion of Tartary was, after all, but a return ? It was from these regions that their forefathers had rolled west ward the tide of migration and conquest ; and now their sons, after building up a great and splendid empire in the regions of the setting sun, were come back with glory upon their foreheads to gather up into their dominion the old ancestral realms that lay beneath the dawn. It was an imposing event ; it was a moment in the midst of history, wonderful with the illusion of romance, and yet impressive with the workings of a vast providence. And the hero of this great spectacle was Iskander III. He had taken up his residence in the palace of the Emir of Samarcand, the ancient palace of the Sultans of Tartary. The Emir was his vassal, one of those figure-heads whom European policy maintains on the thrones of its Asiatic provinces to reconcile the people to subjection, a sop to the prejudices of the priesthood, and a convenient Chief of Police. The Czarina and his family he had left behind"], [271, "DELIVERANCE. 259 in Gatschina. But all the chief members of the Imperial household had arrived in Samarcand ; the full ceremonial of the court was established ; the chamberlains and the grooms, the pages and the heyducs, performed their parts in the stately pageant, and even Asia learned lessons in magnifi cence from Europe. The coronation was fixed for the foUowing day at noon. The man around whom aU this pomp and glory centred was in his cabinet, settling the last detaUs with his Ministers. Points of etiquette had to be considered whose neglect might provoke a social convulsion on the one hand, or a pohtical rebellion on the other. The respective precedence to be accorded to a Russian prince, or to a Turcoman Beg, or to the patriarch of some nomad clan, all these matters presented perplexing problems which only the authority of the great Czar could decide. But at length the tedious discussions drew to an end, and the Ministers began to take their leave. As the Minister of Education, General Count Skouronieff, descended the steps of the palace, he almost ran into the arms of a man whom at first he hardly recognized, so changed was he from the jolly cigar merchant of a few months back. \" Tataroff ! \" \" Your Excellency ! \" Tataroff gave a deep bow. \"I should not have known you \u2014 you are so much altered. What has happened ? \" \" I have only just arrived from Balkistan. I rode hah the way, and it has exhausted me. But your ExceUency is also changed. Your beard has grown longer.\" \" True, Tataroff. I have aUowed it to grow. But"], [272, "260 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. this is not the time to talk. Where shall you be to-morrow ? \" \"I shall attend the coronation in His Majesty's personal suite. I am just on my way to make the necessary request.\" \"I do not doubt you wUl succeed. His Majesty can refuse you nothing, Tataroff.\" The spy threw a questioning glance at the speaker. But the Count's smiling face and bantering air revealed nothing. \"I should like to meet you before the ceremony,\" he added, after a moment's thought. \" I can then embrace you after our long separation, and talk with you about several important items of news.\" \" Where does your Excellency stay ? \" The Count gave him his address. \" I will call upon you precisely at eleven. \" That will do admirably.\" The two men parted, each with a little uncertainty in his air, and while the General took a different direction from the one he had given as his address, Tataroff mounted to the anteroom of his master's cabinet. When his name was announced, the Czar gave an angry frown. \" Curse this fellow ! \" he muttered between his teeth, after giving the order to admit him. \" Will he dog me aU over the globe ? \" The secret agent entered, and remained standing respectfully by the door. \"You are welcome, M. Tataroff,\" said Iskander, trying to infuse some cordiality into his voice. \" But you look UL What has happened ? \" Tataroff could not bring himself to give a hint of"], [273, "DELIVERANCE. 261 the real state of affairs to the man over whom he had so recently exulted in the pride of his double power. \" My health is breaking down, your Majesty,\" he answered. \"The intense strain of the life I have been leading has been too much for me. I have eome here to solicit your Majesty's permission to retire altogether from the secret service, and to ask for some post where I may be safe from the enemies I have made by my devotion to your Majesty.\" In spite of himself, it was difficult for Iskander to conceal the pleasure with which he heard the word retirement. At the prospect of losing this formidable servant he felt as if a load were being taken off his breast. Better to fight the Nihilists alone, than to purchase safety from them at the expense of servitude to the spy. \"I will grant both your requests, M. Tataroff, the more readUy as I can see that your health is not a mere excuse. What is the nature of the post you would like?\" \" I ventured to think of that of Governor of Samarcand.\" The Czar bit his lip. This man's audacity was something alarming. Such a position as he coveted was reserved for the higher officers in the army ; to bestow it upon a police spy would be to create a military revolt. \" I fear there is no precedent for what you ask,\" he said, after a little consideration. \"The post is a purely mUitary one, and as such must be held by a soldier. But I tell you what I can do. I wUl present you to the Emir, with my highest recommendations, and there is no reason why you should not in a short time become his vizier.\""], [274, "262 THE PRINCE OF BALKISTAN. The word caught Tataroff's fancy. It had a ring of Oriental splendour calculated to dazzle his bar barian mind. \" I accept your Majesty's gracious offer,\" he cried. \" Perhaps your Majesty will permit me to form one of your escort in the great ceremony of to-morrow.\" \" By all means. And I will take the first suitable opportunity of introducing you to the Emir.\" Tataroff withdrew, overjoyed. But as soon as he was gone a cloud overcast the monarch's face. Was this a real retirement, or did the spy's request conceal some fresh man\u0153uvre, possibly of a kind hostile to himself? Why had Tataroff come to the coronation ? How had he managed to spring out of the earth, as it were, when he was supposed to be two thousand miles away? Above all, what had he been doing in the affair of Prince Rodolph ? Perplexed with these thoughts, Iskander slept uneasily that night. The repose of General Skouronieff was not quite undisturbed. He, too, had a conversation before he retired to rest, and a conversation which did not leave him altogether well pleased. Nevertheless, he arose in the morning with his accustomed vigour, and dressed himseU with great care. He bestowed affectionate pains on the arrangement of that long beard which Tataroff had remarked upon, and even cut it a little shorter with his own hand. Attired in a brand-new General's uniform, his breast sparkling with stars and medals, Count Skouronieff issued from his chamber and descended to breakfast. Hardly had the meal been cleared away, when M. Tataroff was announced."], [275, "DELIVERANCE. 263 \" Welcome, my dear friend,\" cried the Count heartily as the spy entered ; and, waiving the great difference in their ranks, he extended his arms and bestowed upon the spy a hearty embrace. \" He is afraid of me ! \" was Tataroff's inward sneer, as he released himself from this affectionate demon stration, and rubbed his hand on the upper part of his chest as though one of the Count's numerous ornaments had caused him some discomfort. \" I have come here to tell your Excellency some thing that may cause you surprise. I have resigned my connection with the secret service. I am no longer a member of the police.\" General Skouronieff turned almost white, and stared at Tataroff as if he beheld a ghost. \"I see you are astonished,\" remarked the spy. \" But the fact is, I have strong reasons for this retire ment, some of which you may suspect and others not. However, aU the secrets which came into my possession during my career as a police agent will now be buried and forgotten. It is a positive pleasure to me to look forward to a time when none will either dread or be dreaded by me.\" Still the Count showed no response, only the same attitude of stony wonder, almost of horror. Tataroff began to get nettled. He spoke more plainly. \"Do you understand me, Count? A short time ago I learned that you were connected with a certain project which I frustrated. I informed you that I would keep your secret on condition that you rendered certain services to me in connection with other members of the society to which you belonged. That condition I now annul. Conceal my identity from"], [276, "264 THE TEINCE OF BALKISTAN. your society, and I will conceal yours from the Government. Is it a bargain ? \" \" You have spoken to me too late. I have never betrayed you, but others have. You are condemned to death. I implore you, make your peace with Heaven.\" Tataroff smiled scornfully, but he was startled, nevertheless, to find that his doom had already penetrated to the ears of a man so far removed from the centres of Nihilist activity. \"I do not know how you heard that,\" he said, \"but at all events the society is quite ignorant of my whereabouts. They have no idea of my presence in this distant region, and all I ask of you is to do nothing to put them on my trail.\" \" I will do nothing to put them on your trail,\" responded Skouronieff, preserving the same dazed look, and speaking in a cold, abstracted voice. Then he pulled out his watch. \" It is time we were on our way to the palace. Good morning, M. Tataroff.\" The spy took his departure, much puzzled, and much alarmed at the strange manner of the Count. No sooner was he out of sight than the Count snatched an ornament from his neck, which his beard had concealed, and dashed it to atoms with an iron poker on the hearth of the room. The frag ments and dust he flung into the fire, and then sallied forth to take his place in the procession. Meanwhile an appalling whisper had begun to go round the streets and bazaars, of a tragedy which was said to have taken place in the palace that very morning. The Czar's nervousness, and his reckless reliance on the firearms he always carried about"], [277, "DELIVEEANCE. 265 with him, have been already described. The anxiety caused to his mind by the unexplained appearance of Tataroff, and his mysterious request, had brought Iskander into a state bordering on latent frenzy. He had never forgotten Tataroff's famous boast as to the death of his father, and he strongly sus pected that his own death was being planned by the spy. What more suitable occasion for an assassin to choose for the purpose of impressing the world, than this forthcoming ceremony ? To strike down their enemy while in the act of assuming the crown of Western Asia, would be a triumph well fitted to delight the Nihilists, and redouble their confidence in Tataroff. Iskander III. rose that morning, having worked himself into the firm belief that he was to perish before night. As he was dressing, his secretary \u2014 a mild young man, who would perhaps have gone off his head with fear had any Nihilist approached him\u2014 came quietly into the room, as was his custom, and walked up to where his master stood before a mirror. Plunged in his own thoughts, the Czar heard nothing, and the first intimation he had of the secretary's presence was beholding his reflection behind his own in the glass. The shock was too much for his overwrought nerves. With a hoarse cry Iskander snatched up the revolver that lay before him on his dressing case, and, turning swiftly round, discharged three chambers into the young man's body. He fell dead without a groan, and Iskander, aghast at his own work, sat down on a couch, and burst into hysterical sobs."], [278, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 266 The attendants who rushed in did their best to hush up the terrible incident, but in vain. The news spread with a rapidity peculiar to Oriental countries, and a deep and abiding gloom was cast over the day's event. That event it was impossible to put off. The Czar, with a heavy heart and trembling limbs, went through the weary work. At one moment during the long ceremony he looked around for Tataroff. But Tataroff was not there. It was whispered to him presently, in answer to his question, that the spy had quite suddenly turned blue, and dropped in his place, and had been carried out to recover from the faint. The ceremony went on. The huge, imperial crown, new as regards its workmanship, but on a model centuries old, hung poised for a moment in the air, flashing with gems and beaten gold, a visible glory descending upon the head of the anointed Emperor. Then it came down, and the whole vast concourse rose and chanted a mighty chorus of praise to the Divine Power whose vicegerent they beheld in Iskander I. of Tartary. The ceremony ended, the procession was re-formed to return to the palace. Still wearing his gorgeous diadem, the Emperor stepped into his carriage, and eight coal-black stallions of magnificent breed, and caparisoned with silken housings picked out with pearls and diamonds, drew him through ranks of armed soldiers along the massed thoroughfares. Surrounded by a whole corps of the most cunning police service in the world, surrounded by ten thousand men of the great Imperial Russian Guard, begirt by an army, and looked on by a whole vast"], [279, "DELIVEEANCE. 267 subject populace, what hostile touch, what breath not of the most abject loyalty, could penetrate to Iskander III. ? He reached his palace, entered into his inner cabinet, and dismissed all his attendants. Then, for the first time, he lifted the great crown from off his forehead, and set it down upon a table. And, as he did so, he perceived, lurking beneath the intricate, golden tracery, half-hidden by the blaze of rubies and the glare of emeralds, a tiny slip of paper. Had it been left there by the careless workman whose chisel put the last touches to the precious bauble? Or was it a fragment from the packing case ? The Czar drew it forth with trembling fingers, unfolded it, and read : \u2014 \" To Iskander III. of Russia. \" Ivan Tataroff is dead. So perish those who attempt the lives of the innocent. Proceed no further against Rodolph of Balkistan. \" On behalf of the Central Executive \" of the Nihilist Society, \"Z. The Czar fell upon his knees."], [280, "THE PEINCE OF BALKISTAN. 268 EPILOGUE.
